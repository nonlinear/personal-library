The basis\nfor this is, of course, the characters from Sesame Street and The Muppet Show.\n\nBroadly speaking, Order Muppets are the ones who attempt to control the chaos\naround them. The stoic Sam the Eagle and perennial show wrangler Kermit the\nFrog are the best examples. Chaos Muppets, on the other hand, embrace or even\ncreate their namesake state. See Cookie Monster and Animal.\n\nEven as a kid, decades before Lithwick coined a term for them, I knew I was an\nOrder Muppet. As an avid viewer of both shows, I knew I was Bert, perpetually\nannoyed by Ernie’s carefree approach to everything, regardless of\nconsequences. I was Kermit, always trying to get people to follow the rules,\nas I did. I understood these characters on a fundamental level.\n\nBut the characters I loved were all pure Chaos: Cookie Monster, Grover, Ernie.\nI was fascinated by them, even if I couldn’t let myself behave like them.\nTheir willingness to just let things happen instead of following a plan was\ndisquieting for reasons I couldn’t explain. It was also deeply enticing in a\nway that made me excited but anxious.\n\nI have a strong memory of baking chocolate chip cookies by myself for the\nfirst time and measuring out every single ingredient precisely as laid out in\nBetty Crocker’s New Boys and Girls Cookbook. And when those cookies did not\ncome out of the oven looking or tasting as I thought they would, I was\nabsolutely confounded.\n\n“But I followed the recipe!” I wailed.\n\n“It’s not all about the recipe,” my grandmother informed me. “All kinds of\nthings can go wrong with baking. That’s just how it is.”\n\nThis was not the reassuring message she thought it was. It was deeply\nupsetting to ten-year-old me. What was the point of having recipes if they\ndidn’t turn out perfectly every time?\n\nLater, I would ask myself the same question about the Christian faith in which\nI was raised. For years, I’d been told that if I followed a set of rules\nexactly, I would be happy. If I didn’t follow them, or tried to bend or break\nthem, I would be unhappy. Worse, upon my death, I would experience unending\ntorment.\n\nEventually, I realized that the people telling me what rules to follow were\nthemselves not following them. Or even if they were, they didn’t seem\nparticularly happy. Something, I concluded, was wrong with the methodology.\n\nYou would think that once I discovered the world of magic, I wouldn’t apply\nthe same way of thinking to it. But old habits die hard, and for a long time I\nsought out a path that would explain things clearly and provide ways of\nworking magic that guaranteed results.\n\nI was at least experienced enough to understand that it wasn’t all just about\nsaying the right words, making the right gestures, or using the right\ningredients. Still, I thought there should be an approach that worked reliably\nif I applied its rules. Again, I was disappointed to discover that attempting\nto impose order on magic didn’t work. At least, not for me.\n\nEnter, Chaos.\n\nA few years ago, I reached a point where I was worn out by the magical world.\nAt the same time, I became very interested in the concept of trying to work\nwith the genius loci of the place in which I live. As part of this work, I\ncrafted a clay figure of how I see the spirit of this place and placed it on\nthe table I use for magical stuff. Not long after, I found myself wanting to\nadd another figure to it, a carved wooden representation of the Slavic god\nVeles. Over time, I added more figures. A ceramic statue of commedia dell’arte\ncharacter Punch and the Norse god Freyr. A figurine based on Swedish\nillustrator John Bauer’s depictions of trolls and a little plastic Papa Smurf.\nA chipped alabaster smoking fisherman my husband found at a flea market and\nbrought home saying, “I don’t know why, but I think he belongs with your other\nstatues.” And he did.\n\nI call these figures the Council. At first glance, they have nothing in\ncommon. They come from different pantheons, or no pantheons at all. In some\ncases, they represent ostensibly opposing forces. Anyone looking at them on\nthe table would likely assume they’re simply a collection of figurines,\nperhaps placed there randomly while awaiting dusting.\n\nTo me, what they are is a visual representation of Chaos Witchcraft—seemingly\ndisparate forces working together to achieve results. How they do this, and\nhow I work with them, could be a whole book itself. But this is Thumper’s\nbook, so I want to talk about them now.\n\nI have known Thumper for more than fifteen years, before they were Thumper\n(although they were always Thumper; they just needed someone to point it out),\nbefore they were writing about Chaos Witchcraft (although they were always a\nChaos Witch; they just needed someone to point it out). They have always been\na Chaos Muppet, bouncing from idea to idea, plan to plan, seemingly without\nany real direction. And yet, there has always been a direction, even when it\nwasn’t obvious, and that direction has been bringing them inexorably to the\nwriting of this book.\n\nI will let them speak for themself, because they’re good at it and don’t need\nmy help. What I will say is that like all the strongest magical workings, this\none is manifesting at exactly the right time. As I write this, in the first\nmonths of 2025, the world appears to be on fire. The news seems to be nothing\nbut dire. All around us, things look to be out of control.\n\nThis is Chaos Witchcraft at work on a massive scale. It’s the universe being\ntumbled and spun around at a dizzying pace because it’s out of balance. And\nthis is disorienting for many people, particularly those who wish things\nworked in an orderly, predictable fashion. As we see daily, a whole lot of us\nare searching for ways to stop what’s happening, to reverse it, to bring\neverything back into balance.\n\nWell.\n\nI suggest that Chaos is exactly what we need right now, that in fact\neverything has led to this point. And learning to work with Chaos, and with\nits attendant magic, is what is going to lead to the transformation we need on\nboth the personal and the global levels.\n\nNot that Chaos is relevant only in times of turmoil. The world will not always\nbe on fire. But Chaos will always be relevant, and knowing how to work with it\ncan lead to all kinds of adventures, not to mention results. It’s very easy to\ndismiss the concept of Chaos Witchcraft as something ridiculous, invented as a\nway of saying, “Nothing matters!” Rather, it’s a way of acknowledging that,\noften, the way to achieve what needs to be achieved is to let go of trying to\ncontrol it.\n\nIf you’re an Order Muppet like I am, this may be a frightening proposition.\nAnd even if you’re a Chaos Muppet who revels in disorder and in breaking the\nsystem just for the fun of it, you likely have a lot to learn about what Chaos\nactually is and how to work with it effectively.\n\nNow go on. Get to reading. There’s a lot to talk about.\n\n—Michael Thomas Ford\n\nAuthor of The Path of the Green Man and (as Isobel Bird) the Circle of Three\nseries\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nSo there I was, lying naked on a massage table, wearing LED goggles that\npulsed rhythmic patterns of light into my eyes. Vaguely Middle Eastern trance\nmusic laced with monaural beats pumped in the background as I concentrated on\nvisualizing and charging a psychic sigil, while my buddy Chester performed\nbiofield tuning work around me and led me through controlled breathing\nexercises.\n\n“Tell me again what we’re doing?” I asked.\n\n“Chaos Magic,” Chester replied.\n\nAt that point in my life, I was dimly aware of the existence of Chaos Magic,\nbut I knew very little about it—I assumed it was something in which cyberpunk\ngoths dabbled during their off hours. Chester is, as he puts it, into the woo,\nbut his practices lean more toward energy healing and goal manifestation, so I\nwas surprised to find him throwing himself into something I associated with\ndark alleyways and dystopian futures.\n\nMy own background is rooted firmly in initiatory Wicca. I’m an initiate of the\nGardnerian tradition of witchcraft, as well as the Minoan Brotherhood, an\noffshoot of British Traditional Wicca for men who love men. And while I’ve\nexplored many other paths in the years since my initiations, Chaos Magic never\nquite made it onto my radar. But the technomantic ritual Chester put me\nthrough led to unexpectedly good results, and my interest was piqued.\n\nChester loaned me a handful of books—Liber Null and Psychonaut by Peter J.\nCarrol, Condensed Chaos by Phil Hine, The Book of Results by Ray Sherwin—and I\ndove right in. And the first thing I learned was that Chaos Magic is not a\ntradition, in the sense I was used to. Rather, it’s an experimental approach\nto magical practice, with an emphasis on getting results. Practitioners of\nChaos Magic are not tied down to any one way of doing things. Instead, they\nare trying different methods and techniques to find out what works for them,\nthen trying them again to see if they can achieve consistent outcomes. And\nthey are streamlining their practices, cutting out anything extraneous to\ncreate the most efficient route from Magical Working A to Verifiable Result B.\n\n## The Cinnamon Must Flow\n\nTo get a better idea of how Chaos Magical Theory operates, let’s apply it to a\npopular occult practice and see what happens.\n\nSomewhere around 2021, it became trendy on social media for Witches to\nmanifest prosperity by blowing cinnamon into their homes through their front\ndoors on the first of every month. People took this practice very seriously,\nand there were a plethora of Instagram reels and TikTok posts demonstrating\nhow to properly engage in the procedure.\n\nThe typical approach to this spell would be to accept it as-is and follow the\ndirections step-by-step, and there is nothing wrong with doing so. However, if\nyou were to approach this working from a Chaos Magic perspective, you would\nwant to identify a few key factors: the components, the necessary components,\nthe limitations, and the workarounds. With all that information on hand, you\nwould then want to determine if the procedure can be streamlined or made more\nefficient. Let’s start with the components: cinnamon, the first day of a\nmonth, a doorway, breath.\n\nIn the original working, there’s nothing saying that the cinnamon has to be\npowdered, so a cinnamon stick could conceivably be used, especially since\ncinnamon can be harmful to pets—a stick of cinnamon can be easily retrieved\nand put away before Spot or Fluffy has the chance to ingest it. But it’s that\nlast component we don’t want to overlook: We’re blowing cinnamon across a\nthreshold, and breathing life into something is very much a magical act. If\nyou’re going to use an entire cinnamon stick, blow on it first, then yeet it\nthrough the front door.\n\nAnother alternative would be to add powdered cinnamon to a mug, pour hot\ncoffee or tea over it, and blow the steam through your front door, which would\nalso cover all the essentials of the spell. Either way, within the Chaos Magic\ncurrent, we’re not just randomly skipping steps because we don’t feel like\ndoing them. Instead, we’re differentiating between what is and is not\nnecessary to perform a given spell, and we’re focusing on those necessities,\nfiguring out how to maneuver around obstacles to get the results we’re looking\nfor.\n\n## Eris in the Machine\n\nIn researching Chaos Magic, I learned that some of its pioneers had been\nheavily influenced by Discordianism—the modern worship of Eris, Greek goddess\nof Discord—which delighted me to no end. I’d been a closet Discordian for\nclose to two decades, not quite secretly venerating Eris in my own way,\nwithout direction. But as I slid further into Chaos Magic, bumbling into\nonline forums and thumbing through obscure, limited-run texts, I came across\nmore and more references to Discordianism, and more and more practitioners\nwho, if not in active relationship with Eris, definitely held her in high\nregard. And I also started interacting with people who referred to themselves\nas Chaos Witches, even if they didn’t seem entirely sure what that meant.\n\nAt some point, it occurred to me that I should maybe write a book about that.\n\nAnd this is where things got weird.\n\nI kept telling myself I’d get around to writing a book, but I also kept\nputting it off. And every time I set the idea aside, something odd would\nhappen, with the oddities increasing in intensity the longer I procrastinated.\nIt was almost as if some discordant, supernatural force was attempting to get\nmy attention, I mused.\n\nAnd with that thought, my blog stopped working.\n\nI’d been writing at Patheos Pagan for a little over a year at that point.\nWhenever a Patheos author publishes an essay, the post goes into a queue to be\nautomatically added to their channel’s Facebook page in regularly scheduled\ntwo-hour intervals. These posts are displayed with a cover photo and title,\nbut for some reason, when I would attempt to upload anything, the post would\nappear on Facebook as an unmarked link to Patheos dot com, with no image or\ndescription. Clicking on the link would lead to the actual post, but there was\nnothing visual to encourage readers to click the link in the first place.\n\nConcerned, I contacted Patheos and asked, “Help?” To which they replied, “Huh.\nThat’s odd. We’ll take care of it right now.” And then it happened to my next\npost, and the two posts after that, until I was bombarding Patheos with emails\nasking, “Why is this happening to me?” And they were writing back, “We don’t\nknow, and it’s freaking us out.”\n\nEventually, Patheos’s IT department discovered an incompatibility between\nFacebook and the auto-scheduling software, which created a glitch that,\nsomehow, only affected my blog. And because it was only causing problems for\nme, I suddenly realized what needed to be done to rectify the technical\nissues.\n\nI sat down that evening and banged out a book proposal to Llewellyn.\nImmediately afterward, I added a new post to my blog, and two hours after I\nhit “publish,” it turned up on the Patheos Pagan Facebook page, cover photo\nand title displayed faultlessly.\n\n“Point taken,” I said, in the general direction of Eris.\n\nShe didn’t respond, at least not out loud. But my blog has worked right ever\nsince, and I’m currently writing the introduction to a book on Chaos\nWitchcraft, so if anything, I am very glad I finally caught the hint.\n\n## What to Expect from This Book\n\nOn the following pages, you’ll find information on the history and practice of\nChaos Magic from a witchcraft perspective, along with personal experiences and\nrecommendations. What you won’t find is the correct way to practice any of the\nprevious magic, because honestly, there’s not one—there’s just what’s worked\nfor me, which will hopefully give you the impetus to find out what works for\nyou. Treat this book as a sounding board that opens roads: Borrow what works\nand leave the rest.\n\nAnd as you read, you’ll also be taking a deep dive into Discordianism, since\nthat religion had such an impact on the development of Chaos Magic, primarily\nbecause Discordians firmly believe in not firmly believing in anything. In her\nown work on the subject, occultist Waspie Joanne Fitzpatrick submits that\nChaos Witchcraft might be more accurately called Discordian Witchcraft, and I\nwholeheartedly agree.¹ However, she also points out that the term Chaos\nWitchcraft has already entered the lexicon, and that rechristening it would\ninvolve more effort than it’s worth. Ergo, we’re going to go ahead and roll\nwith Chaos Witchcraft as well, but the Discordian mindset of no-belief will\nallow you to explore other spiritual systems at will. And by taking cues from\nthe Discordian worldview, you’ll be striding toward mastery of the core\ntechnique of Chaos Witchcraft, which is …\n\n## Belief as a Tool\n\nIn the eighth episode of the Netflix original series KAOS, Zeus confronts the\nFates—Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos—to avert a prophecy. The Fates are\nunsurprisingly not surprised to see Zeus, and they take a moment to explain\nthe reality of the situation to him.\n\n“For your prophecy to come to pass, you must bring it into being,” says\nLachesis.\n\n“If you decide it doesn’t exist, then it doesn’t exist,” says Atropos, to\nwhich Lachesis adds the mic drop: “The possibility exists, but without your\nbelief, it cannot come to pass.”\n\nIn other words, Zeus can let his prophecy have power over him, or he can alter\nhis beliefs and have power over his prophecy.\n\nAnd so can you.\n\nThe concept of paradigm shifting, or using belief as a magical tool, is\nprobably the most unmistakable hallmark of Chaos Magic, which, naturally,\nmeans it’s also the most misinterpreted. A lot of people take belief as a tool\nto mean, “I can believe whatever I want.” Well, okay, yes, that’s true. But\nthere’s a big difference between just saying, “I can believe whatever I want,”\nand actively adopting or shuffling through beliefs to accomplish your magical\ngoals.\n\nIn Chaos Magical Theory, it’s understood that a belief is a subjective truth,\nand that structural belief systems have power trapped within them. If we can\ndeconstruct or alter our own beliefs, we can release some of that power and\nuse it to fuel our magic. This is reinforced by the Discordian concept of the\ncatma. Whereas a dogma is couched in unquestionable truth, a catma is a\ntransient truth: It remains unquestionable until such time as the believer\nchooses to question, rework, or discard it.²\n\nNow, when it comes to structural belief systems, it’s almost instinctive to\nlook solely at the religions that are prevalent in existing cultures—Hinduism,\nHeathenism, Satanism, Christianity, Buddhism, and so on. And we will be\ntalking about those religions and what we might unlock from them. But we can\nalso remodel the beliefs we already have to be in line with whatever work\nwe’re trying to accomplish. Or, for lack of a better way of saying it, we can\nbelieve things that haven’t been believed yet.\n\nThere’s a wonderful epic novel by China Miéville called Kraken that perfectly\nexemplifies the use of belief as a tool. In this story, the preserved body of\na giant squid gets stolen from the British Museum of Natural History, which,\nin turn, thrusts an unassuming docent named Billy Harrow into a war between\nvarious doomsday cults taking place in the underworld of London. The cults\nemploy magic in a variety of ways to further their agendas, and over time,\nBilly starts to pick up on how magic works—specifically, the magic of\nmetaphors.³\n\nAt one point, while looking for people who can provide him with the\nwhereabouts of the squid, Billy finds a key that had accidentally been paved\ninto the asphalt of a city street. He also comes across a lightbulb that a\nrestaurant employee had stored on top of a frying pan.\n\nThe next time Billy meets up with an informant, he’s ready to make a deal:\n\n“I can pay you. Put this in the right hands, this’ll unlock the road.” He held\nout the key. He held up the bulb. “And I don’t know what’s incubating in this,\nbut someone might hatch it.”⁴\n\nThe lesson here is that there’s magic incubating everywhere, even (or\nespecially) in seemingly mundane places.\n\nAs a Chaos Witch, all you have to do is hatch it.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 1\n\n\n## The Chaos\n\n## Witch Goes Viral\n\nAs a movement, Chaos Magic coalesced in England in the 1970s and grew more\nformalized through the ’80s and ’90s. However, its development was influenced\nnot only by existent magical traditions, but by art, literature, pop culture,\nand even comic books.\n\nThe original adepts of Chaos Magic referred to themselves as Chaos Magicians,\nor Chaotes. Today, however, more and more practitioners are dubbing themselves\nChaos Witches, distinguishing themselves from Traditional and Eclectic Witches\nby how they approach and utilize their magic. There is some nuance involved,\nas well as some crossover, but the deeper you dive into it, the clearer the\ndistinctions between Chaos Witchcraft and other articulations of magical\npractice will be.\n\n## Creators of Chaos\n\nThe history of Chaos Magic is defined by its pioneers, along with the artists\nand authors who contributed to its current and paved a winding way for the\nrest of us to follow. Here are some of the most notable names of Chaos Magic.\n\n## Austin Osman Spare (1886–1956)\n\nAustin Osman Spare was an artist recognized for the sexual and sometimes\nmonstrous imagery he created. Spare’s concept of Kia (or the collective\nconsciousness of the universe) and his work with sigils laid the groundwork\nfor the modern development of Chaos Magic.\n\n## William S. Burroughs (1914–1997)\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs was one of the most influential figures of the Beat\nGeneration. Best known for his novels Junkie and Naked Lunch, Burroughs was\nalso a Magician who utilized cut-ups as a form of divination, as well as a\nmethod of cursing his enemies.\n\n## Kerry Thornley (1938–1998) and Greg Hill (1941–2000)\n\nBetter known as Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst and Malaclypse the Younger, Kerry\nThornley and Greg Hill were the founders of Discordianism and authors of the\nPrincipia Discordia, the sacred text of the Discordian religion, which itself\nhad a huge impact on Chaos Magic. I will be quoting liberally from the\nPrincipia throughout this text, so brace yourself. Incidentally, Thornley was\nthe first person to use the word Pagan in reference to the modern practice of\npre-Christian religions.⁵\n\n## Genesis P-Orridge (1950–2000)\n\nGenesis P-Orridge was a nonbinary performance artist, singer-songwriter, a\nstudent of William Burroughs, and one of the original members of Thee Temple\nov Psychick Youth, a loose-knit network of magical practitioners with shared\ninterests in Chaos Magic and experimental art.\n\n## Ray Sherwin (1952–2024)\n\nRay Sherwin was an independent publisher, musician, and aromatics expert who,\nalong with Peter J. Carroll (see the following), cofounded the Illuminates of\nThanateros, an initiatory organization dedicated to practicing Chaos Magic in\na group setting. Sherwin’s work The Book of Results revolutionized the process\nof casting magical sigils.\n\n## Peter J. Carroll (b. 1953)\n\nPeter J. Caroll is an occultist and physicist who is credited with originating\nthe concept of Chaos Magical Theory. Carroll has written numerous books on\nChaos Magic, two of which—Liber Null & Psychonaut and Liber Kaos—brought Chaos\nMagic to the attention of the greater esoteric community.\n\n## Jaq D Hawkins (b. 1956)\n\nJaq D Hawkins is a writer of fantasy, steampunk, and speculative fiction who\nhas also authored several definitive books on the practice and history of\nChaos Magic.\n\n## Phil Hine (b. 1963)\n\nPhil Hine is a prolific author and lifelong student of the occult, whose book\nCondensed Chaos introduced the idea that Chaos Magic could have guiding\nprinciples.\n\n## Julian Vayne (b. 1968)\n\nJulian Vayne is a lifelong scholar of the occult who has written extensively\nfor both academic and metaphysical publications. His work blends the Chaos\nMagic current with elements of modern Paganism and Witchcraft.\n\n## Wanda Maximoff (First appearing in X-Men #4, March 1964)\n\nIt feels weird to include a comic book character on a list of historical\nfigures. But pop culture has always had a profound influence on the occult,\nand while the people mentioned earlier were (and are) without a doubt Chaos\nMagicians, it’s Wanda Maximoff—better known as the Scarlet Witch—who launched\nthe image of the Chaos Witch into the public domain.\n\n## Magician Versus Witch:\n\n## The Steel Cage Death Match We Didn’t Know We Needed\n\nAs it turns out, the Chaos Witchcraft current was already bubbling long before\nMarvel got involved and unwittingly promoted it. In a 2016 YouTube video,\nauthor and Chaos scholar Kelly-Ann Maddox explains that she identifies as a\nChaos Witch versus a Chaos Magician, since the word Magician tends to read\nmasculine, whereas Witch encompasses all gender identities. Moreover, she’s a\nwitch who engages in Chaos Magic, so Chaos Witch encapsulates the whole of her\npractice.⁶\n\nWay back in the 1990s, when I first dipped my toes into Paganism, it was\nunderstood that Magicians practiced high magic, or theurgy (invoking spirits\nwith the goal of achieving union with the Divine), and Witches practiced low\nmagic, or thaumaturgy (the working of “natural” magic to bring about\nwitnessable effects). These definitions were in place for a long time, but\nhonestly, they’ve worn thin. They are sexist, for one thing—in the olden days,\nmen who practiced magic were respectable Magicians, whereas women who\npracticed magic were untamable Witches consorting with the Devil. So, you\nknow, kind of a gender bias there.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## Rhetorical Questions\n\nBefore moving on, I want you to take a moment and ask yourself a few\nquestions. There are no right or wrong answers: These are just things to\nponder as you begin your exploration of Chaos Witchcraft.\n\nWhy do you want to be a Chaos Witch?\n\nIf you already identify as a Chaos Witch, what does that mean to you?\n\nDoes a Chaos Witch need to act or present themself in particular ways?\n\nHow important is it to you that your practice be described as Chaos\nWitchcraft?\n\nAre you willing to be flexible with your understanding of Chaos Witchcraft?\n\nAnd again, there are no right or wrong answers here. If you want to be a Chaos\nWitch so you can shoot Chaos from your fingertips, that’s fine—I don’t know\nhow much I can help you, but you still provided an honest answer. And I want\nyou to focus on that honesty, getting in the habit of setting right and wrong\naside in favor of what’s right for you.\n\nThe distinction between high and low magic is problematic as well, since it’s\nclassist at best, and racist at worst. Theurgy and thaumaturgy are two\nseparate things, but Witchcraft, especially religious Witchcraft, is going to\nemploy both, so we can’t really hand one off to the Magician and the other to\nthe Witch and call it a binary.\n\nThe reality is this: Both Magician and Witch are gender-neutral terms for an\noccult practitioner. However, there are key differences between the two: The\nMagician works within a given social structure to effect change primarily in\nthe self, while the Witch works on the outskirts of that structure to effect\nchange in themself and the world around them; the Magician seeks mastery over\nand/or merger with the unseen (be that gods, spirits, or what have you), while\nthe Witch fosters partnerships with the unseen and, in some cases, works for\nthe unseen instead of with the unseen.\n\nAnd be it known that any one kind of magical practitioner is not better than\nany other, nor are the previous definitions monolithic—alternative definitions\nwith varying mileages exist, and that’s legit. Regardless of the\ninterpretation you adopt, it’s good to have a clear idea of what you mean when\nyou call yourself a Witch.\n\nAnyway, that covers the Witch part of Chaos Witch. Let’s break into the Chaos\npart.\n\n## Chaos, Eclectic, and Chaotically Eclectic\n\nCalling oneself a Chaos Witch does very much seem to be an online phenomenon,\nand if you’ve spent any time in witch-oriented social media groups or forums,\nyou may have encountered an occasional proclamation along the lines of, “I’m a\nChaos Witch. I take from everything.” Which would make Chaos Witchcraft a\nrationale for cultural appropriation—something that should vigilantly be\navoided and that I will discuss in chapter 9—as well as a postmodern\nrebranding of Eclectic Witchcraft.\n\nThe big issue here is that Eclectic Witchcraft doesn’t need a new label.\nEclectic Witches have been around for, well, pretty much always, and\nWitchcraft itself is syncretic, because magic tends to find a way to survive,\nregardless of the circumstances in which it finds itself. Eclectic Witchcraft\nand Chaos Witchcraft do share some similarities, in that both are experimental\nin nature, and both tend to draw from a variety of sources. But what\ndistinguishes them from each other is how they approach belief: In Eclectic\nWitchcraft, practices are assembled around belief. In Chaos Witchcraft,\nbeliefs are assembled around practice.\n\nAs an example, let’s say you’re flipping through an old book of folklore, and\nyou find a couple of cool spells you want to try. However, the spells include\nreferences to the Christian god, which doesn’t click with you. The eclectic\napproach would be to remove those references and replace them with invocations\nto a Pagan god with whom you already have a working relationship. However, the\nChaos approach might be to convert to Christianity for however long it takes\nto cast the spells, and then return to your original belief system once the\nworkings are complete.\n\nJust as a Witch is not somehow better than a Magician, Chaos Witchcraft is not\nbetter than Eclecticism: Both are completely valid approaches to magic. But\nwhile they do have some things in common, they are foundationally very\ndifferent things. And it is understandable that people would get the framework\nof Chaos Witchcraft confused with Eclectic Witchcraft, since both suggest\nfinding whatever works and plugging it into what we’re already doing. But\nChaos Witchcraft is also fueled by the avoidance of dogma (more on this in the\nupcoming chapter on principles), so the Chaos Witch isn’t just going to pick\nup techniques and jam them into an existent belief system—they’re going to\nstep out of their current belief system to see what makes those techniques\ntick, and to determine how best to utilize them.\n\n## The Trouble with (Comic Book) Chaos\n\nIn 1996, the movie The Craft premiered, which inspired a generation of angsty\nteens (myself included) to explore Witchcraft. And in 2005, Pagans and\noccultists of European descent plowed themselves into Hoodoo, after hearing\nabout it for the first time in the horror film The Skeleton Key. As such, it\nmakes sense that in 2021, there was an explosion of practitioners identifying\nas Chaos Witches once the television series WandaVision premiered, with the\nmovie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness hitting screens and\nstreaming services in 2022. Both the show and the film featured the Scarlet\nWitch (as the heroine, villainess, or antihero, depending on your point of\nview and/or charitability), whose power was consistently described as Chaos\nMagic.\n\nThere are Chaotes out there who lose their minds whenever the Scarlet Witch\ncomes up in conversation, citing the blatant—albeit\nfictional—misrepresentation of Chaos Magic. And overall, I do understand their\nsentiments. But just as the fanciful Victorian concept of a Witch as a\npractitioner of pre-Christian religion laid foundations for the Modern\nWitchcraft Revival, so too did the cinematic depiction of a Witch who\npractices Chaos Magic result in real-world Chaos Witches.\n\nOr at least, it resulted in Chaos Witches on the internet. Which, if anything,\nhas moments of realness. And look, I realize that a lot of budding occultists\nwill watch Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and think, “I, too, am\nfierce and unfettered and more than a little unbalanced! I am definitely a\nChaos Witch.” And you know what? I am completely okay with that. Art reflects\nlife reflects art—some people are going to learn about Chaos Witchcraft for\nthe first time by watching a blockbuster movie, and while a chunk of them may\nnever get past the aesthetic or the name, a handful will head down to Ye Olde\nMagick Bookshoppe and start doing some factual research.\n\nThose are the ones to watch out for. Because sooner than later, one of them\nwill have an epiphany about using belief as a tool, and they will either warp\nreality or marry a robot. And I am dying to see what happens either way.\n\nIn her first appearance, Wanda was a member of Magneto’s Brotherhood of Evil\nMutants. Her mutation granted her what was described as a Hex Power, meaning\nthat she could cause unlikely, entropic things to happen. Originally, she\ndidn’t have much control over her powers—she would wave her hands and\nprobability would go sideways, but she didn’t have any say as to what the\neffects would be. Over time, Wanda developed a better grip on her powers, and\nshe started studying Witchcraft to gain refinement and control. It was also\nexplained that she had a natural talent for magic that had been unknowingly\ngranted to her by an ancient demon named Chthon.\n\nFor a long while, Magneto was believed to be Wanda’s father, and it was\nunderstood that she had inherited her mutation from him. In the late ’90s,\nhowever, it was determined that Wanda’s powers, if left to grow naturally,\nwould have been more like her dad’s, but Chthon’s machinations resulted in\nWanda being able to manipulate magical energy instead of electromagnetic\nenergy, specifically the kind of magic that Chthon himself employed: Chaos\nMagic.\n\nIn the Marvel Comics continuum, Chaos Magic is defined as an evil force\npowerful enough to unravel Creation, and it is considered the polar opposite\nof Magic for Order, the kind of magic employed by Doctor Strange and other\nheroic Sorcerers. As a Discordian, this is where I find myself\nuncharacteristically unable to suspend disbelief, because contrary to popular\n(and pop culture) opinion, Chaos is not the opposite of Order. As you’ll see\nin the following chapters, Chaos is not the opposite of anything, simply\nbecause Chaos is anything.\n\nBut in order (no pun intended) to understand Chaos, we’ve got to make it past\nthe first goddess to ever rise out of it.\n\nIt’s time to meet Eris, y’all.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## A Simple Paradigm Shift\n\nA paradigm is a set of assumptions or patterns that are accepted and upheld as\ntruth by the members of a given culture or community. If you compared a given\nbelief system to, say, a collection of exotic plants, the greenhouse in which\nthey thrive would be the paradigm. And just like you can move a plant from one\ngreenhouse to another, within Chaos Magic, practitioners can move from one\nparadigm to another, adjusting their worldview to fit whatever work they’re\ntrying to accomplish. Here’s an easy way to start experimenting with that.\n\nIt’s common to hear Pagans and Witches talk about “working with” deities,\nwhich, honestly, makes me a little twitchy. I feel like we tend to say\n“working with” to sound proactive, when what we’re really doing is worshiping,\nor venerating, or acknowledging—all of which are perfectly fine things in\ntheir own right.\n\nBut if we change up the language we use to define how we interact with our\ngods, we might notice those interactions solidifying into something more\npersonal and symbiotic, which will benefit all parties involved.\n\nTry this: For the next five weeks, whenever you find yourself about to say\nthat you “work with” a particular god or spirit, say that you walk with them\ninstead. Describe your relationships with your gods in terms of moving forward\nthrough the world alongside them as, if not equals, partners. See how that\nfeels.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 2\n\n\n## Origins,\n\n## Elements, and Eris\n\nIn her youth, a friend of mine’s grandmother took a train trip across Ireland,\nduring which she found herself seated next to an older Irish lady. They struck\nup a conversation, and after a while, my friend’s grandmother asked, “So … do\nyou believe in the Little People?”\n\n“Oh, of course not!” the older woman replied, affronted. A few moments of\nsilence passed. And then the older woman leaned over and whispered, “But that\ndoesn’t mean they’re not real.”\n\nAnd that punchline really sums up Discordianism: It began as a joke, but it\nquietly caught on, and ironically, adherents started taking it seriously, to\nthe point where it had a quantifiable effect on pop culture. The author Robert\nAnton Wilson incorporated numerous Discordian concepts and characters into The\nIlluminatus! Trilogy, which he cowrote with Robert Shea, and the British synth\npop duo the KLF—known in the ’90s for hit dance tracks like “3 a.m. Eternal”\nand “Justified and Ancient”—was a Discordian band who gained notoriety for\nabsurdist publicity stunts. Incidentally, the KLF were also briefly known as\nthe Time Lords and put out a song called “Doctor Who,” which is played during\nsporting events to this day. If you’ve ever been at a basketball game and\nfound yourself scream-singing “Doctor Whooo-oo,” congrats! You were reacting\nto Discordian music. Eris herself has been represented on both the large and\nthe small screen, appearing as a recurring character in The Grim Adventures of\nBilly and Mandy, as a featured character in an episode of Harley Quinn, and as\nthe main antagonist in Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas.\n\n## The Principia Behind the Curtain\n\nAs a religion, Discordianism originated at some point between 1957 and\n1959—nobody seems to remember the exact date, which tracks. Lifelong friends\nGreg Hill and Kerry Thornley were hanging out in a bowling alley, drinking\ncoffee, talking about life, and complaining about all the confusion in the\nworld. If one could somehow manage discord, they opined, all the confusion\nwould be resolved.⁷\n\nAnd then according to legend, everything suddenly froze, and a chimpanzee\nappeared. The ape was holding a scroll, upon which was a glyph resembling a\nyin-yang, but with a pentagon on one side and a golden apple on the other. And\nas Hill and Thornley stared, the chimpanzee yelled, “Somebody had to put all\nthis confusion here,” and promptly exploded … as talking chimpanzees are wont\nto do, one supposes. At any rate, the pair were knocked unconscious, and when\nthey came to, they discovered that everything around them had kicked back into\nmotion, leaving them with even more questions and nothing resembling answers.\n\nFor the next five nights, Hill and Thornley researched the symbol they’d seen\non the scroll, and at some point, they realized it was the Golden Apple of\nDiscord from Greek mythology. Victorious but exhausted, they fell asleep, and\nwhile slumbering, they had a shared dream in which the goddess Eris appeared\nand spoke to them.\n\n“I am chaos,” Eris proclaimed to them. “I am the substance from which your\nartists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children\nand clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that\nyou are free.”⁸\n\nUpon waking, Hill and Thornley declared themselves High Priests of Eris,\nchanged their names to Malaclypse the Younger (sometimes shortened to Mal-2)\nand Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst, and founded the Discordian Society in her\nhonor, an organization that, according to them, had no formal definition.\nMal-2 and Lord Omar each presided over a sect of the Discordian Society—the\nParatheo-Anametamystikhood of Eris Esoteric (POEE) and the Erisian Liberation\nFront (ELF), respectively.⁹\n\nIn 1963, Mal-2 and Lord Omar self-published the Principia Discordia, a sacred\ntext that described their worldview and included a unique Discordian mythology\nthat explained the origins of and relationship between Order and Disorder.\nAlthough the original printing was only comprised of five copies, the book\ndeveloped an unexpected cult following, and since then, several editions have\nbeen released by different publishers—the material within the Principia is\n“KopyLeft, All Rites Reversed,” meaning that anyone is free to reprint it (or\ncopy and paste a few chunks of it while banging out a book on Chaos\nWitchcraft).\n\nAs amusing as the contents of the Principia can be, not everything within it\nhas aged well. It’s worth keeping in mind that regardless of how progressive\nthey were, its creators were still two white dudes writing comedy in the early\n1960s—some things that seemed hilarious back then are not very funny today.\nJust read it with a critical eye, as you would any other religious text.\n\nEris, on the other hand, has aged very well. Let’s get to know her a bit\nbetter.\n\n## Eris the Creatrix\n\nIn Greek mythology, Eris is the personification of strife. According to the\nancient Greek poet Homer, she was the daughter of Zeus and Hera and the twin\nsister of Ares, and because of that sibling relationship, Homer conflated her\nwith Enyo, the goddess of war and bloodshed. On the other hand, Hesiod—another\nGreek poet and contemporary of Homer—asserted that Eris was the daughter of\nNyx, the personification of night, and Erebus, the personification of\ndarkness, who were both children of Khaos—the primordial spirit who existed\nbefore everything else. Hesiod also depicted Eris as the mother of the\nKakodaimones, the troubles that plagued humankind, who resided in Pandora’s\nbox when not out wreaking havoc and stirring up internet drama.\n\nInterestingly, Hesiod stated that there were actually two Erises, or Erites.\nOne, he claimed, was a goddess of war and slaughter, akin to Enyo. The other,\nhowever, was a goddess of competition and endeavors, who encouraged humans to\nachieve their potential and become the best possible versions of themselves.\nAs he wrote in his Theogeny, “[The second Eris] is one you could like when you\nunderstand her.”¹⁰ This ties into a description of Eris found in the\nPrincipia: “Eris is not hateful or malicious. But she is mischievous, and she\ndoes get a little bitchy at times.”¹¹ Remember the blog malfunction I talked\nabout in the introduction of this book? I can confirm.\n\nWhile the Discordian understanding of Eris was clearly informed by Hesiod, the\nPrincipia describes her origins a bit differently than Hesiod did. While both\nview Chaos as the consciousness that existed before existence, Principia goes\non to describe this Chaos (or Khaos) as masculine, naming it Void.¹²\n\nPer Discordian cosmogony, after five eons or so (or however primordial\nentities mark time), Void gave birth to a daughter—Eris, who herself was born\npregnant. Since she was the first being, she became the goddess of Being, and\nafter fifty-five years, she gave birth to her own children, making her the\ngoddess of Creation.\n\nShe did not, at this stage in the game, spawn the Kakodaimones, at least not\naccording to the Principia. Rather, her first offspring were the Elements, the\nbuilding blocks of reality—just not quite the Elements we’re used to.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## A Quick Note About Loki\n\nBefore we go any farther, let’s address the fiery half-giant in the room.\n\nA lot of people with an interest in Chaos Witchcraft are going to read this\nchapter and be like, “Hey, why are we only talking about Eris? What about\nLoki? After all, he’s the god of Chaos. Shouldn’t we focus on him? Why are you\nsubjugating Loki?”\n\nI promise I’ve got nothing against Loki. I know he tends to get a bad rap in\nsome Heathen circles, but personally, I think he’s great. Plus modern\nveneration of Loki is at least partially fueled by Tom Hiddleston’s portrayal\nof him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and as we’ve already seen, pop\nculture occultism is definitely an aspect of Chaos Witchcraft.\n\nBut Loki’s particular brand of Chaos is not quite what we’re exploring here.\nEris and Loki do seem to share some traits, but they play very different roles\nin their respective mythologies.\n\nLoki has a consistently strong presence throughout Norse myth, and while he is\nsometimes depicted as an ally of the Aesir, he is just as often depicted\nbetraying them. In a culture that valued law and structure, Loki represented\nunpredictable, ominous instability, and knotted twists of fate—things to be\nrespected but warded against.\n\nEris, on the other hand, was more of an occasional walk-on character in Greek\nmyth. She was certainly seen as trigger-happy, but she generally did not cause\nproblems unless she was specifically provoked, or unless she was instructed to\ndo so by one of the Olympians. But while the machinations of Eris can range\nfrom offbeat to bizarre, they are not, in and of themselves, Destructive: She\njust wants what she wants when she wants it and will make that known until she\ngets it.\n\nI mean, yes, she was the one who tossed the golden apple (more on this in a\nbit), but it was other goddesses fighting over it that ultimately trashed the\nwedding of Thetis and Peleus, and it was the series of unfortunate decisions\nmade afterward that led to war. Comparatively, if the wedding had taken place\nin Norse mythology, Loki would’ve stolen the apple, lost it to a Frost Giant\nduring a dice game, traded Freya’s hand in marriage to get it back, rescued\nFreya after the other gods threatened to end him, eaten the apple to hide it\nfrom everyone, then given birth to a giant golden aphid or something. And the\nother gods would’ve been like, “Well, Loki, we hope you’ve learned your\nlesson,” and he would’ve been like, “Oh, yeah, totally. Hey, does anyone know\nwhere I can find some mistletoe?”\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Loki and centering devotion around\nhim, I highly recommend Loki and Sigyn: Lessons on Chaos, Laughter & Loyalty\nfrom the Norse Gods by Lea Svendsen. But for now, let’s keep our sights set on\nthe Discordian understanding of Chaos, which will provide a very workable\nfoundation for the practice of Chaos Witchcraft.\n\n## Elementary, My Good Neikos\n\nThe Greek poet and philosopher Empedocles is credited with originating the\nconcept of the Four Elements as objective states of matter: That is,\neverything in existence can be broken down into the fundamentals of Earth\n(solid), Air (gas), Fire (plasma/energy), and Water (liquid), which can\nchange, combine, or revert to their original forms based on the effects of two\nopposing forces, Love (attraction) and Strife (repulsion). Empedocles\npersonified the Elements—which he called roots—as Zeus (Fire), Hades (Air),\nand Nestis (another name for Persephone; Water), and he referred to Love and\nStrife as Philotes and Neikos.\n\nAnd here is another opportunity to practice your paradigm shifting, because\naccording to the Principia, the Elements are not Fire, Air, Water, and Earth,\nor even Zeus, Hades, Hera, and Nestis. For now, you can toss all those\nElements right out of your head and change the locks behind them.\n\nWithin Discordianism, the Elements are Boom, Pungent, Sweet, Prickle, and\nOrange.\n\nWhile ludicrous at first glance, if you look a little deeper, you’ll notice\nthat the five Elements line up with the five senses: They represent everything\nwe can hear, smell, taste, touch, and see.\n\nBoom—Audition\n\nPungent—Olfaction\n\nSweet—Gustation\n\nPrickle—Somatosensation\n\nOrange—Vision\n\nMetaphorically, this means that by giving birth to the Elements, Eris created\neverything that can be physically perceived. And if you wanted to be sensible,\nyou could find correspondences between the Discordian Elements and the\nclassical Elements, like so:\n\nBoom—Spirit\n\nPungent—Air\n\nSweet—Water\n\nPrickle—Earth\n\nOrange—Fire\n\nBut this is Discordianism we’re talking about, so sensical isn’t going to be\nthe most effective modus operandi. Instead of squeezing the Discordian\nElements into a standardized Pagan framework, let them stand independently and\nevolve into their own unique facets of Chaos Witchcraft. Although the\nElemental correspondences are going to come in handy later on, so just tuck\nthem in your back pocket for now.\n\nAnd speaking of evolution, let’s also go back and look at what Hesiod had to\nsay about the two Erises: one likeable, one bloodthirsty. It’s that other Eris\nwho stands out in the next phase of Discordian mythology, because Eris has a\nkid sister. And not a cool, fun one.\n\n## Aneris the … Destructrix?\n\n## Is That a Word? It Is Now.\n\nShortly after he gave birth to Eris, Void produced another daughter, whom he\nnamed Aneris and whom the Principia equates with the Greek goddess Harmonia.\nAlthough she was younger than Eris, Aneris quickly grew to be bigger than her\nsister. And whereas Eris had been born pregnant, Aneris was born sterile, and\nshe was very jealous of her sister’s ability to create. And so, whenever Eris\nbrought something into being, Aneris took it away and un-made it, thus\nbecoming the goddess of Non-Being and Destruction. Incidentally, the fact that\nAneris stands taller than Eris explains why there are more things that don’t\nexist than things that do.\n\nIt turns out that Empedocles was right after all—he just got some of his names\nwrong. Instead of Philotes, it is Eris as the goddess of Creation who brings\nthe Elements together, and instead of Neikos, it is Aneris who tears them\napart.\n\nYou might be tempted to say that there is a whole lot of Greek philosophy\nembedded in Discordianism, and you would not be wrong. But since one of the\ngoals of a Chaos Witch is to be able to switch your beliefs around at will,\nit’s more important to understand that there’s a truly ridiculous amount of\nDiscordianism within Greek philosophy.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## Hail, Squat\n\nI was first introduced to Squat the Parking Goddess by a Gardnerian High\nPriestess after she witnessed my preternatural ability to find good parking in\naction. “You’re favored by Squat!” she exclaimed. And then she added, “But you\nhave to treat her like an important goddess, or else she won’t help you find\nparking spots.” I took her advice, going so far as to hang a Sheela-na-gig\npendant from my rearview mirror as a votive idol of Squat, and my parking\npowers have only continued to grow since then.\n\nThere is not a lot of information on Squat’s origins, other than the\nunverifiable theory that Discordians “invented” her. Personally, I think she\nwas originally a liminal goddess—like Cardea, the Roman goddess of door\nhinges—who went on to reinvent herself, but that’s just me. Regardless of\nwhere she came from, she has become a bona fide modern deity, venerated most\noften in large metroplexes with limited space for vehicular storage. In Urban\nPrimitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle, author Raven Kaldera describes her\nas “three hundred pounds of warm, round, abundant, billowing flesh,” and once\ninvoked, she will find a parking space and fill it with her voluptuousness,\nsaving it for you until you arrive.¹³\n\nAs you pull into a parking lot, call upon Squat by reciting the following\nverse:\n\nSquat, Squat,\n\nWe like you a lot,\n\nWe think you’re hot,\n\nHelp us find a parking spot.\n\nIf a parking space doesn’t reveal itself, try telling her a dirty joke—the\noral lore about Squat suggests she’s partial to dirty nun jokes, so fire one\noff. The dirtier the better. If your joke is accepted, you will improbably but\nimmediately find excellent parking.\n\nI unfortunately cannot share my favorite dirty nun joke, which was taught to\nme by an Episcopal priest, since it is far too filthy to repeat in print.\nHowever, the following classic limerick—composed by an anonymous poet—has been\noffered to Squat on more than one occasion, so it will work for you too.\n\nThere once was a nun from Siberia,\n\nwho was born with a virgin interior,\n\nuntil a young monk,\n\njumped into her bunk,\n\nand now she’s a mother superior.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 3\n\n\n## Chaos\n\n## Explained and\n\n## Goddesses Snubbed\n\nOf all the occult topics floating about out there, Chaos is probably the most\nmisunderstood. At the same time, it’s one of the easiest to comprehend.\nAccepting Chaos for what it is versus falling back on preconceived notions\nmight be a challenge, but once you do accept it, a whole new realm of\npossibility will open for you. Literally.\n\n## Chaos Condensed\n\nLet’s start with a quotation from the Principia Discordia: “Magicians, and\n[their] progeny the scientists, have always taken themselves and their subject\nin an orderly and sober manner, thereby disregarding an essential metaphysical\nbalance. When Magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art\ninstead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man’s\nendeavors, then they will be able to pursue their art with a lighter heart,\nand perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it, and therefore gain more\neffective magic. CHAOS IS ENERGY.”¹⁴\n\nPeter J. Carroll elaborated on this concept in Liber Null & Psychonaut,\ndefining Chaos as “the ‘thing’ responsible for the origin and continued action\nof events.” Carroll goes on to say, “It is the force that has caused life to\nevolve itself out of dust.”¹⁵ So that, in a nutshell, is Chaos: It’s the\nprimordial Void out of which everything sprang; it’s what existed before\nexistence. And it remains the momentum behind all action, and the potential\nbehind all possibilities. And turning those possibilities into probabilities\nis the ultimate goal of Chaos Witchcraft.\n\nMisconceptions set in, though, when Chaos gets used interchangeably with words\nlike mayhem or entropy. Or, my least favorite, which snuck its way into our\ncultural lexicon via the rise of role-playing games, chaotic.\n\nIt’s tempting to take in the empirical nature of the Chaos approach to the\npractice of Witchcraft and think, “This doesn’t seem very chaotic.” And\nhonestly? It really doesn’t. Nor should it. Because from a magical\nperspective, Chaos is not chaotic. Chaos is something else entirely.\n\nWe live in a world that often seems hellbent on sticking to binary thinking,\nbut in Discordian terms, there is only one true binary: Creation and\nDestruction, which came out of Chaos just as Eris and Aneris came out of Void.\nCreation and Destruction may occur cyclically, or concurrently, or even\nsimultaneously, but they are two very separate forces. Everything else we\nwould consider opposing binaries is either an illusion or, more commonly, a\nbimodality.\n\nA bimodality is a fluid polarity: It’s basically a gradient scale, with two\ndistinct, apparently opposite plots, but a lot of wiggle room between them.\nSome things clearly relate to one plot or the other, but some things are\nsimilar to both or are only somewhat similar to one or the other, while other\nthings don’t resemble either. Light and dark, for example, aren’t really\nopposites, because both are dynamic—there are points where they are distinct\nfrom each other (noon and midnight, say), and points where they are\nindistinguishable (dusk and dawn). Plus it depends on who’s viewing them, and\nwhat they’re using as a reference point.\n\nChaos, on the other hand, is not a bimodality, because it has no apparent\nopposite, nor does it require one. Chaos is not, nor has it ever been, the\nopposite of Order.\n\nThe opposite of Order is Disorder.\n\n## Inventing Order\n\nOne day, Eris was playing with a pile of things she’d created, and she noticed\nthat when aligned in certain ways, those things created patterns and seemed to\nmake some kind of sense. Eris thought this was great and called her new\ndiscovery Order. However, she also noticed that when left in disarray, those\nsame things seemed to not make any sense at all. Eris liked this even better\nand called this lack of pattern Disorder.\n\nBecause Eris was so thrilled with Disorder, she decided to name it Eristic,\nafter herself. And because she and Aneris did not get on well, Eris figured\nshe’d extend an apple branch and declared Order to be Aneristic, after her\nsister.\n\nWhat you can take from this parable is that Order and Disorder are artificial\nconstructs, attempts to understand the cosmic powers of Creation and\nDestruction at the human level. And just like light/dark, big/small, good/bad,\npositive/negative, or chartreuse/lavender, Order and Disorder are\nbimodalities. If you took a piece of paper, divided it in half, and wrote\nOrder at the top of one side and Disorder on the top of the other, and started\ntrying to categorize things, you’d realize very quickly that some things are\nvery recognizably one or the other, but some things wouldn’t quite be either,\nand some things would be both.\n\nAs a bimodality, Order and Disorder are apparent, meaning that they can be\nperceived, but perceivability makes them subjective, reliant on who is looking\nat them, and how those viewers choose to classify what they see.\n\nThink about it in terms of building a house. There are steps that need to\nhappen chronologically. Those steps can represent Order. However, once\nconstruction begins, things are going to get ugly. There’s going to be dirt\nand mud and dust, and unexpected problems are going to arise, and things are\ngoing to get off schedule, and there will probably be a few arguments: All of\nthat can represent Disorder. But once construction is complete, we have a\nhouse, and that house can once again represent Order. And once the house is\nlived in for a while, things are going to get cluttered and worn: Disorder.\n\nBut at no point in this process are Order and Disorder stationary or\nobjective. Someone might look at the ongoing construction and think, “Wow,\nthis is happening in a very orderly fashion.” Whereas someone else might look\nat the finished house and think, “Geez, none of these design concepts go\ntogether. This is very disorderly.” And so, Order and Disorder are\narbitrary—they are just how we choose to see things, regardless of whether we\nrealize we’re making that choice.\n\nMy favorite example of the Order/Disorder bimodality comes from the movie\nClueless (1995), in which the character Amber is described as a Monet—she’s\npretty at a distance, but up close, she’s just a big mess. There’s a lot of\nDisorder going on inside the apparent Order. And while she’s not the most\nlikable character, she’s not a bad person. And there’s more to her personality\nthan just all light or all dark.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## The Gender of Chaos\n\nYou may have noticed that Void is described with male pronouns, and yet he\ngives birth. This is because gender, like so many things in the universe, is a\nsubjective bimodality.\n\nPage 00050 of the Principia Discordia states, “Disorder is simply unrelated\ninformation viewed through some particular grid. But, like ‘relation’, no-\nrelation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that\nmale-ness is ‘absence of female-ness’, or vice versa, is a matter of\ndefinition and metaphysically arbitrary.”¹⁶\n\nThere are many, many people in the world who are perfectly content with the\ngender they were assigned at birth, to the point where they may not ever give\nit more than a passing thought, and that’s great! There is absolutely nothing\nwrong with that. But individually, your gender expression is something over\nwhich you have complete control. Regardless of societal norms, you have the\nfinal say over what you wear, how you style yourself, and what mannerisms you\nproject.\n\nAllowing yourself to be aware of what you’re capable of changing, even if you\nchoose not to change anything, is an act of claiming power.\n\nAlso, this is a metaphor. Just keep that in mind.\n\n## Surfing the Grids\n\nHere’s what we know about Order and Disorder so far. They are:\n\nArtificial.\n\nBimodal.\n\nApparent.\n\nSubjective.\n\nBut on top of all that, Order and Disorder are cultural.\n\nThe Principia Discordia defines culture as a group of people who look at the\nworld through a particular grid, a grid being a given belief system,\nphilosophy, or religion.¹⁷ When Chaos Witches paradigm shift, we’re actively\nchoosing which grid we want to look through. Some grids make things look\nOrderly, which means those grids are exhibiting what’s known as the Aneristic\nPrinciple. Other grids make things appear Disorderly, which means those grids\nare exhibiting what’s known as the Eristic Principle.\n\nWhat’s important to remember here is that those principles are in the grids,\nnot in the world. For example, my eyeglasses have blue-tinted lenses, so when\nI wear them, everything around me takes on a blue tinge. But that tinge is in\nthe lenses, not in whatever I happen to be viewing. Likewise, if I put on\nsomeone else’s glasses, everything would look wonky, and if I tried to\nnavigate my surroundings while wearing them, I would probably fall more than I\nalready do. But that wonkiness is also in the lenses, not in my immediate\nenvironment.\n\nSome cultures look at apparent Order and assume that it is somehow\nfundamentally correct, which leads them to believe that Disorder is\nincorrect—think about how some sects of Fundamentalist Christianity aver that\nanything they don’t approve of is satanic. This is called the Aneristic\nIllusion. Other cultures look at apparent Disorder and decide that it is\nsomehow fundamentally correct, thereby concluding that Disorder is the natural\nway of things, and that Order is unnatural—like an armchair revolutionary who\ndoesn’t understand the difference between anarchism and anarchy. This is\ncalled the Eristic Illusion. And these are illusions, because they are\nentirely in our heads—they are what we choose to believe, whether or not we\nrealize we’re making that choice.\n\nAnd because Order and Disorder are bimodal, they exist on spectrums, governed\nby the one true binary of Creation and Destruction. Order can be Creative and\nresult in structurally sound designs, or it can be Destructive and result in\nsystemic oppression. Disorder can be Creative, which is the inspiration behind\na lot of really cool art. But it can also be Destructive, such as when sports\nfans riot and set cars on fire after their favorite team wins a big game.\n\nSomething to keep in mind here is that apparent Order and Disorder are not\nrespectively good and bad, or vice versa. But just as every action has an\nequal and opposite reaction, so too does the haphazard application of Order\nand Disorder have consequences … as we can see in the following myth, which is\nfoundational to Discordianism.\n\n## The Original Snub\n\nPicture it: Mount Olympus, thirty-two hundred years ago (give or take). All\nthe gods had gathered to celebrate the wedding of the sea goddess Thetis and\nthe mortal hero Peleus—all of them, that is, except Eris, who had a reputation\nas a troublemaker and therefore wasn’t invited.\n\nThe festivities were in full swing, and everyone was having a marvelous time,\nwhen suddenly, the doors to the banquet hall flew open, and Eris cartwheeled\nin, flipping through the air and landing in a dramatic, action movie pose.\nWith all trepidatious eyes upon her, she drew back and lobbed a golden apple\ninto the middle of the dance floor, then twerked backward out of the room\nbefore anyone could stop her, and, according to Discordian lore, went off to\nenjoy a hotdog.\n\nEngraved into the apple was (For the Fairest), and immediately, five goddesses\ndove for it, among them Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. (The other two were never\nidentified, but I like to assume they were Artemis and Persephone.) Things got\nvery tense, very quickly; strongly worded critiques were thrown. And, to\nregain control of the situation, Zeus announced a beauty pageant, the winner\nof which would receive the golden apple.\n\nThe goddesses agreed to the terms, and Zeus dispatched Hermes to find a judge.\nHermes settled on Paris of Troy, a part-time shepherd and full-time nepo baby,\nwho had a reputation for objectivity and could allegedly be counted on to make\nan unbiased decision. Immediately, the goddesses tried to bribe him: Hera\noffered him sovereignty, Athena offered him military might, and Aphrodite\noffered him the love of the most beautiful woman in the world.\n\n“Sold,” yelled Paris. And he presented the apple to Aphrodite. (So much for\nobjectivity.)\n\nAt the time, the title of Most Beautiful Woman in the World belonged to an\ningenue named Helen, who was inopportunely married to Menelaus, the king of\nSparta. Regardless, she and Paris had a meet-cute and ran off together. A\nprofoundly unamused Menelaus pursued them, and the subsequent series of events\neventually led to the Trojan War.\n\nSo that’s the myth as it’s commonly understood. But as is so often the case\nwith mythology, there is a whole lot more to the story. Let’s deconstruct it.\n\nFirst of all, the marriage was not consensual.\n\nThere was a prophecy (standard issue in those days) that if Thetis had a child\nwith another god, that child would grow up to overthrow Zeus. Zeus did not\nlike this one bit, and so he decided to marry Thetis off to the mortal Peleus,\nthus circumventing the prophecy entirely. Peleus, having no idea how to woo a\ngoddess, went to the river god Proteus for advice, who explained that Thetis\nwas a shape-shifter: All Peleus had to do was sneak up on her, tackle her, and\nhold on for dear life as she assumed different forms. Eventually, she’d tucker\nout and agree to marry him.\n\nThis inexplicably worked, probably because these myths were originally written\ndown by the ancient Greek equivalent of tech bros. Thetis and Peleus ended up\nengaged, and the prophecy was averted, but Zeus knew he’d dealt in some\nshadiness to make that happen. Zeus not inviting Eris to the wedding is\nbasically a refusal to accept that there could be consequences to his\nactions—in his mind, if he (literally) didn’t invite trouble, there wouldn’t\nbe any trouble. Except …\n\nThe apple should have gone to Thetis.\n\nIt’s straight out of Etiquette 101—if you’re at a wedding, and someone hands\nyou anything marked For the Fairest, just give it to the bride and go on with\nyour life. I shouldn’t even have to explain this, Hera.\n\nOh, and by the way, there was another prophecy that everyone conveniently\nforgot about.\n\nWhile pregnant, Paris’s mother had a portentous dream that her son would be\nresponsible for the fall of Troy, so once Paris was born, she and her husband\npassed him off to a local shepherd and were like, “Handle this problem for\nus.” The shepherd was ultimately unwilling to unalive an innocent baby, so\nParis grew to adulthood and returned to his parents, who rationalized that\nprophecies maybe weren’t that big of a deal after all.\n\nAnd then Paris eloped with Helen, and Troy got paved over by the Spartans. Go\nfigure.\n\nBut here’s the weird thing. Hermes is the god of divination: As such, he would\nhave been fully aware of the prophecy haunting Paris. So why would he pick\nParis as a judge, even though that decision would make a whole lot of carnage\ninevitable?\n\nWas Hermes secretly working for Eris?\n\nSpoiler alert: He totally was. And I am going to table that for now, but I\npromise we’ll get back to it soon.\n\n## That Escalated Quickly\n\nFrom a Discordian standpoint, Zeus’s actions in the myth of the Original Snub\nreflect Destructive Order: He was attempting to restrict individual liberties\nand get everyone to do what he wanted so that he could remain in charge.\nThetis, on the other hand, represents Creative Disorder—her power to change\nshape is indicative of free and unfettered expression.\n\nBy arranging her marriage to Peleus and by Peleus physically restraining her,\nDestructive Order was imposed on Creative Disorder. And whenever Destructive\nOrder is imposed on Creative Disorder, mythologically or otherwise,\nDestructive Disorder results. This is known as the Law of Eristic Escalation.\nTo sum up:\n\nZeus, Peleus, Menelaus, and Paris’s Parents = Destructive Order\n\nThetis, Eris, Hermes, and Assorted Shepherds = Creative Disorder\n\nEverything That Happened After the Apple Hit the Dance Floor = Destructive\nDisorder\n\nAs a Chaos Witch, this is what you will use in place of more debatable occult\nguidelines like the Threefold Law, which I will investigate at length in the\nchapter on Chaos Ethics, so stay tuned.\n\n## Putting the Chaos in Chaos\n\nI mentioned in chapter 1 that Austin Osman Spare referred to the shared\nconsciousness of the universe as Kia, and I will add here that Peter J.\nCarroll described Kia as life force, in which Chaos is concentrated to spark\nhuman consciousness. Carroll also theorized that between Chaos and the\nphysical world, and between Kia and waking thought, there is a sort of non-\nsubstance called Aether, which is basically all the possibilities that Chaos\nhas generated, but which have not yet (and may or may not ever) come to\nfruition.¹⁸\n\nBy working within this unfamiliar but accommodating paradigm, focusing\nthoughts on specific desires or statements of intent, and manipulating matter\nin certain ways—say, lighting candles, burning incense, or drawing sigils—bits\nof Aether can be coerced into solidification, which in turn can result in\ncontrolled coincidences. This is the basis of Chaos Magic.\n\nTo put it all in Discordian terms: Out of Chaos come Eris and Aneris, and out\nof Eris come the five Elements (Aether). By practicing Witchcraft, and by\nOrdering and Disordering things in innovative ways, the intangible concepts of\nBoom, Pungent, Sweet, Prickle, and Orange can have concrete, substantial\neffects.\n\nA lot of people hear the term Chaos Magic and assume it’s something vaguely\nsinister, or at the very least disorganized, but in reality, chaos is an\nadjective that means “action-based.” Just as Chaos itself is the force behind\nactivity, Chaos Magic—and, by extension, Chaos Witchcraft—is an active,\nexperimental approach to magical practice, with an emphasis on achieving\nverifiable and repeatable results.\n\nAll that said, I do comprehend that chaotic is going to mean … well, chaotic,\nno matter how much I kind of wish it didn’t. But for those of us who are\nWitches, Magicians, Sorcerers, Cunningfolk, Tasseomancers, or what have you,\nit’s important that we fully understand the words we use to describe our\npractices, so that we can direct our wills as accurately as possible to get\nthe results we want.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## Rolling for Ism\n\nI honestly do not remember where I first came across the following apparatus,\nalthough I want to say Peter J. Carroll originally developed it, so I’m just\ngoing to attribute it to him. Regardless, as a method for gaining practical\nexperience in moving back and forth between different belief systems, it\ncannot be beat.\n\nObtain a six-sided die, and assign a different theism to each number, like so:\n\nAtheism\n\nDuotheism\n\nHenotheism\n\nMonotheism\n\nPantheism\n\nPolytheism\n\nRole the die and look at the number. Whatever theism comes up is your new\nreligious belief system.\n\nFor instance, in trying this technique out for myself, I rolled my die and got\nthe number four: monotheism. My goal, then, was to restructure my current\nbeliefs into a monotheistic worldview, like so:\n\nDiscordianism is a monotheistic religion based entirely on the worship of\nEris, the goddess of discord. We have myths that come out of ancient Greek\nreligion that talk about Eris interacting with other gods and goddesses, but\nthose are just stories used to teach, and to give us a better understanding of\nEris herself. There are tales of Eris in conflict with other goddesses, but\nagain, these are just stories. Eris is both Creation and Destruction: We have\nno need of any other goddesses, since Eris is more than capable of handling\nboth. And while it would be easy to say, “Oh, other goddesses are just aspects\nof Eris … ” No. There aren’t any other goddesses. There really is just Eris.\nAnd this is what I fully believed for twenty-four hours.\n\nRole your die every morning for five days, and every day, rework your core\nbeliefs to fit your new theism. You may discover that some theisms are more\ncomfortable than others, or you may be surprised to learn that your beliefs\nadapt well to all of them. Either way, you will find it easier and easier to\nshift your beliefs around as needed, which is a huge step toward using those\nbeliefs as magical tools.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 4\n\n\n## Discordian\n\n## Seasons and\n\n## Apostles of Eris\n\nIt may feel counterintuitive to think of organized religion as doing anything\npositive in the world, especially for those of us who are actively attempting\nto deconstruct or distance ourselves from it. But we have to remember that\nmost religions didn’t pop into existence in their current capitalistic forms.\nAs Paul Huson put it in his iconic book Mastering Witchcraft, “Ironically, you\nwill find that all the innovators and founders of religions were\nrevolutionaries in their time who took issue with their parent religions and\nwere usually labeled heretics of one sort or another for their pains.”¹⁹\n\nMost religions start off, if not entirely beneficial, then at least\ndiverting—something to give adherents a respite from the toils of daily\nliving. It isn’t until someone gets into a position of authority and thinks,\n“You know, I’ll bet I could make a decent living if I bottled and sold this …\n” that problems metastasize.\n\nBut this is where Discordianism comes in handy. It can assist you in sifting\nthrough all the crud that has accumulated around religions and dig out the\nuseful core tenets. Plus, you don’t have to wrestle with it all by yourself.\nAs a Chaos Witch, you have access to the Apostles of Eris, who can guide you\nalong your way through the seasons they represent.\n\n## Seasons of Philotes\n\nThe Discordian calendar is the same length as the standard Gregorian calendar,\nalthough it is divided into five seasons, each of which is made up of seventy-\nthree days, organized into five-day weeks. These seasons are, in chronological\norder:\n\nChaos (January 1 to March 14)\n\nDiscord (March 15 to May 26)\n\nConfusion (May 27 to August 7)\n\nBureaucracy (August 8 to October 19)\n\nAftermath (October 20 to December 31)\n\nAt first glance, the names of the seasons may strike you as ominous. But just\nas Chaos in a magical sense is neither good nor bad, so are the seasons\nthemselves neutral in their overall meanings. The Season of Chaos is about\nbeginnings; Discord is a shift in balance; Confusion is a change in\nperception; Bureaucracy is structure; and Aftermath represents both endings\nand looking ahead.\n\nThink about it like this. A baby is born, moving from the safety and comfort\nof the womb into a bright, loud, overwhelming environment (Chaos). The baby is\ninitially unaware of their own sentience, but eventually, they learn the two\nwords every parent dreads—no and why—and they begin schooling, where, for the\nfirst, jarring time, they must interact with people outside of their immediate\nfamily unit (Discord).\n\n![calendar](../Images/image-SL0MTL6D.jpg)\n\nDiscordian Calendar\n\nThings move along relatively smoothly for a while, but suddenly, puberty hits,\nand their body starts changing in disconcerting and unexpected ways; their\neducation changes as well, and they become dimly aware that the world is a lot\nmore complicated and nuanced than they may have been led to believe\n(Confusion).\n\nEventually, it’s time to strike out on their own and become an actual grownup,\nwhich means finding sources of income, and figuring out how to navigate the\nlabyrinths of insurance, taxes, and human resources (Bureaucracy). They may\nalso end up starting a family of their own, parenthood being about as\nbureaucratic as you can get: As Deborah Lipp once wrote in a blog post,\n“Mothers need management skills. There’s like, paperwork.”²⁰ And as they begin\nto move into their twilight years, they will reflect on their life experiences\nand start preparing for the next stage of existence, be that reincarnation or\na really long nap, depending on their belief system (Aftermath).\n\nThe Discordian calendar can be a challenge to work with at first, but it’s\nanother great exercise in paradigm shifting. The more you actively engage with\nit—like, say, celebrating Samhain on Aftermath 12 instead of October 31—the\nmore comfortable you’ll become with it. Remember that paradigm shifting is a\nskill like any other: It takes practice, but sooner than later, it will become\nsecond nature.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## Katsaridaphobia\n\nPage 00027 of the Principia Discordia features a small sketch of a cockroach,\nflanked by a handwritten caption: “This is St. Gulik. He is the Messenger of\nthe Goddess. A different age from ours called him Hermes. Many people called\nhim by many names. He is a Roach.”\n\nHis full title is St. Gulik the Stoned, and the fact that he’s a roach is a\nterrible, terrible pun. As it also says in the Principia, “There is historic\ndisagreement concerning whether [the Apple of Discord] was of metallic gold or\nAcapulco.” In other words, if you smoke a roach, you’ll receive messages from\nthe Goddess.\n\nIt probably goes without saying, but Mal-2 and Lord Omar were both big fans of\nthe Devil’s Lettuce, and the sheer number of marijuana jokes in the Principia\nreflects that.\n\nBut here’s where things get interesting: Remember how, in the myth of the\nOriginal Snub, Hermes managed to pick the one judge whose actions would result\nin the most devastating consequences? If St. Gulik is the messenger of the\nGoddess, then Hermes was (and still is) the wingman of Eris, and how freaking\ncool is that?\n\nModern Discordian lore suggests that if you see a roach, you should a) accept\nit as a message from Eris, and b) squash it to let Eris know the message was\nreceived. Since I live in South Texas, I get a lot of messages from Eris, of\nthe gargantuan, flying variety. Don’t get me wrong: I am flattered that she\nwants to reach out. But whenever I turn on my kitchen light, and one of her\nmessages lunges out of the shadows before gleefully skittering under the\nrefrigerator, I do sometimes wish I’d stayed Episcopalian.\n\nIncidentally, page 00040 of the Principia states that “Sri Syadasti should not\nbe confused with Blessed St. Gulik the Stoned, who is not the same person but\nis the same Apostle.” If you run into any challenges connecting with Sri\nSyadasti, try touching base with Hermes instead.\n\n## Five Holy Helpers\n\nAccording to the Principia Discordia, the Apostles of Eris are the pioneers of\nDiscordianism. But as literary devices, the Apostles are personifications of\nmajor world religions and ideologies—Taoism, African Diasporic religions,\nHinduism, classical Greek philosophy, and the Abrahamic faiths—all of which\nhave, in one way or another, subversively promoted the advancement of Creative\nDisorder. Each of the Apostles has governance over one of the seasons, and\neach of them made a significant contribution to Discordianism. In order of\nappearance, the Apostles are:\n\nHung Mung, Patron of Chaos\n\nDr. Van Van Mojo, Patron of Discord\n\nSri Syadasti, Patron of Confusion\n\nZarathud, Patron of Bureaucracy\n\nThe Elder Malaclypse, Patron of Aftermath\n\nIn Oven-Ready Chaos, Phil Hine presents a short Discordian Opening Ritual,\ncomposed by a Discordian known only as Prince Prance.²¹ By breaking this rite\ninto five parts, we’re left with a (mildly edited) prayer for each of the\nApostles, which you can use as petitions whenever you’re exploring the belief\nsystems they represent.\n\n## Hung Mung\n\nHung Mung (more accurately transliterated as Hong Meng) is the patron saint of\nthe Season of Chaos and the personification of Daoism. Unlike the other\nApostles, Hung Mung existed in pre-Discordian mythology: He was first\nmentioned in the ancient Chinese Zhuangzi—one of the foundational texts of\nDaoism—as a primordial being, akin to Khaos or Void. Additionally, his name is\na play on words, translating to “Mists of Chaos,” “Vast Obscurity,” or (I\npromise I am not making this up) “Big Goose Dummy.”\n\nAs a philosophy, Daoism espouses compassion, detachment, humility, moderation,\nand spontaneity, and Daoists work to align themselves with the Dao, or the\nnatural order of things. If you want to weave any of these concepts into your\nChaos Witchcraft, pray to Hung Mung before you begin.\n\n![Chao](../Images/image-K3CO3O8L.png)\n\nThe Sacred Chao\n\nHung Mung’s contribution to Discordianism is the Sacred Chao, the symbol\nfeatured on the scroll shown to Mal-2 and Lord Omar by that talking\nchimpanzee. The section of the Chao with the pentagon is called the Hodge,\nwhich represents the Aneristic Principle; likewise, the section of the Chao\nwith the apple is called the Podge, which represents the Eristic Principle.\n\nAccording to the Principia, the Sacred Chao “symbolizes absolutely everything\nanyone need ever know about absolutely anything, and more! It even symbolizes\neverything not worth knowing, depicted by the empty space surrounding the\nHodge-Podge.”²² In layman’s terms, what’s “worth knowing” is the true nature\nof Order and Disorder—they are perceptions of Chaos, not Chaos itself. (The\nSacred Chao has also become a ubiquitous symbol of Discordianism, and wearing\na Sacred Chao pendant or accessory is a good way to let other Chaotes out in\nthe wild know that you, too, are part of the Greatest Show on Earth.)\n\n## The Prince Prance Prayer to Hung Mung\n\nBlessed Apostle Hung Mung, Great Sage of Cathay,\n\nBalance the Hodge and Podge and grant me equilibrium.\n\n## Dr. Van Van Mojo\n\nDr. Van Van Mojo is the patron saint of the Season of Discord and the\npersonification of African Traditional Religions (ATRs), sometimes referred to\nas African Diasporic Religions. If you are an initiate of a particular ATR, or\nif you are part of a culture in which a given ATR is prevalent, Dr. Mojo can\nact as a bridge between your background and your Chaos practice. If you are\nnot part of one of these cultures, Dr. Mojo can still help you draw respectful\ninspiration from them without falling into appropriation.\n\nFor instance, Catholic iconography is often utilized in ATRs to represent\nspirits and divinities. This is a form of assimilation, which occurs whenever\na marginalized group adopts the traditions of a dominant group, either to\nsurvive or because the dominant group has imposed those traditions on the\nmarginalized group. If you need to hide your Witchcraft in plain sight or\ndisguise it within the trappings of a mainstream faith, Dr. Mojo can offer\ndirection.\n\nWithin Discordianism, Dr. Mojo is revered for creating the Turkey Curse, a\npowerful, magical act of Creative Disorder, and you’ll learn how to throw the\nTurkey Curse later in this book. Incidentally, according to the Principia, the\nPOEE and the Erisian Liberation Front are at odds over the identity of the\nPatron of Discord: The POEE asserts that it’s Dr. Van Van Mojo, but the\nErisian Liberation Front claims the true Apostle is named Patamunzo\nLingananda.²³\n\nBasically, Discordians honor the Patron of Discord by arguing over who the\nPatron of Discord is, which is decidedly on brand.\n\n## The Prince Prance Prayer to Dr. Van Van Mojo\n\nBlessed Apostle Van Van Mojo, Doctor of Hoodoo and Vexes,\n\nGive me the Voodoo Power and confuse my enemies.\n\n## Sri Syadasti\n\nSri Syadasti is the patron saint of the Season of Confusion and the\npersonification of Dharmic religions like Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and\nBuddhism. These religions emphasize the importance of meditation, and a common\nthread between them is belief in reincarnation as determined by Karma, or the\nsum of one’s actions—good and bad—in one’s current and previous lives.\nAdditionally, Dharmic religions are pluralistic, in that they acknowledge the\nexistence of more than one path to enlightenment and embrace diversity in both\npersonal opinion and representation of the Divine. If you’re trying to get\nyour brain around meditation, or even if you’re having trouble finding\nsuitable votive images of the gods you venerate, Sri Syadasti is your go-to\nguy.\n\nSri Syadasti’s contribution to Discordianism is his name, which can be used as\na contemplative mantra. His full name (allegedly Sanskrit), in its entirety,\nis Sri Syadasti Syadavaktavya Syadasti Syannasti Syadasti Cavaktavyasca\nSyadasti Syannasti Syadavatavyasca Syadasti Syannasti Syadavaktavyasca, which\n(again allegedly) translates to “All Affirmations Are True in Some Sense,\nFalse in Some Sense, Meaningless in Some Sense, True and False in Some Sense,\nTrue and Meaningless in Some Sense, False and Meaningless in Some Sense, and\nTrue and False and Meaningless in Some Sense.”²⁴\n\nIf you decide to experiment with his full name in meditation, feel free to\nstick with the English translation, rather than trying to memorize the\nSanskrit version. I promise he won’t mind.\n\n## The Prince Prance Prayer to Sri Syadasti\n\nBlessed Apostle Sri Syadasti, Patron of Psychedelia,\n\nTeach me the relative truth and blow my mind.\n\n## Zarathud\n\nZarathud, also known as Zarathud the Staunch and Zarathud the Incorrigible, is\nthe patron saint of the Season of Bureaucracy and the personification of\nclassical Greek philosophy. He is also the personification of ceremonial\nmagic, because if there’s anything out there that epitomizes bureaucracy, it’s\nceremonial magic.\n\nThe Principia explains that Zarathud was once a priest but became a hermit\nafter getting himself labeled an Offender of the Faith.²⁵ We’re not told what\nhe did to earn that designation, but he can definitely act as a mentor if\nyou’re studying philosophy, curious about Goetic ritual, or just stubbornly\nengaging in any activity that would get you burned at the stake in Medieval\nEurope.\n\nZarathud’s contribution to Discordianism is the Pentabarf, also known as the\nFive Commandments, the “rules” to which all Discordians must adhere. A full\nexplanation of the Pentabarf can be found in chapter 9.\n\n## The Prince Prance Prayer to Zarathud\n\nBlessed Apostle Zarathud, Hard-Nosed Hermit,\n\nGrant me the Erisian doubt, and the constancy of Chaos.\n\n## The Elder Malaclypse\n\nThe Elder Malaclypse is the patron saint of the Season of Aftermath and the\npersonification of Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The\nPrincipia describes him as a wandering wise man who followed a five-pointed\nstar across Ancient Mediterrania.²⁶ Despite his associations, he’s a lot less\nSouthern Baptist Convention, and a lot more Jesus Chasing the Moneylenders Out\nof the Temple.\n\nThe Elder Malaclypse appears as a character in The Illuminatus! Trilogy, where\nhe is depicted as an immortal, shape-shifting being of pure intuition,\nimpersonating Billy Graham, Satan, Jean-Paul Sartre, and a cabdriver. He also\nmasqueraded as Jesus after the crucifixion, pretty much just because he could,\nand he likes to amuse himself by inventing conspiracy theories.\n\nPrayers to Malaclypse are appropriate if you’re trying to incorporate a\nparticular Abrahamic technique into your practice, or if you have no palpable\nsense of self-preservation and want to go on an adventure.\n\nThe Elder Malaclypse’s contribution to Discordianism is his role as the\nnamesake of Malaclypse the Younger, which is actually a pretty big deal—after\nall, if Malaclypse the Younger hadn’t had someone to name himself after, we\nmight not have Discordianism today.\n\n![portrait](../Images/image-BZHN2NRV.png)\n\nPortrait of the Author as the Elder Malaclypse,\n\nCourtesy of Lucas E. Wagner\n\nThe bigger point here being that it’s customary within many Pagan and\nWitchcraft traditions to take on a new name, and Discordianism is no\ndifferent. As it says in the Principia: “Discordians have a tradition of\nassuming HOLY NAMES. This is not unique with Erisianism, of course. I suppose\nthat Pope Paul is the son of Mr. and Mrs. VI? And also TITLES OF MYSTICAL\nIMPORT.”²⁷\n\nIf you’re thinking about adopting a magical name as part of your Chaos\nWitchcraft journey, you absolutely have my blessing. Even my dad calls me\nThumper at this point, but it is surprisingly not the name on my birth\ncertificate. And if you’re having trouble settling on a new name, the Elder\nMalaclypse can guide you to the right one.\n\n## The Prince Prance Prayer to the Elder Malaclypse\n\nBlessed Apostle Malaclypse, Elder Saint of Discordia,\n\nGrant me illumination and protect me from stupidity.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## The Five-Sided Circle\n\nWitches cast circles for a variety of reasons: to delineate sacred space, for\nprotection, or to mark the beginning of a ritual. All these are perfectly\nvalid, but from a psychological perspective, casting a circle draws your\nattention inward, directing your focus toward the magical or meditative work\nyou’re doing and away from outside distractions.\n\nCircle casting can be an elaborate affair, but it does not have to be. All you\nreally need is a quiet space where you won’t be interrupted, with enough room\nto stand and turn around. You’ll also need to know the cardinal directions of\nthe area—use a compass if you’re not sure.\n\nStand in the center of your space and clap five times, slowly and\ndeliberately. Then raise your arms to the east, hands out and fingers splayed,\nand chant: Hung Mung, Hung Mung, Hung Mung, Hung Mung, Hung Mung.\n\nJump as if startled by a loud noise. Then, with your arms still out and\nfingers still splayed, turn to the south and chant: Van Van Mojo, Van Van\nMojo, Van Van Mojo, Van Van Mojo, Van Van Mojo.\n\nCrinkle your nose, as if it’s suddenly been hit with an acrid aroma. Turn to\nthe west and chant: Sri Syadasti, Sri Syadasti, Sri Syadasti, Sri Syadasti,\nSri Syadasti.\n\nLick your lips, as if they’re coated in your favorite flavor of lip balm. Then\nturn to the north and chant: Zarathud, Zarathud, Zarathud, Zarathud, Zarathud.\n\nShake your hands, as if they’ve fallen asleep, and you’re trying to get rid of\nthe pins and needles. Then point your left hand toward the ceiling and your\nright hand toward the ground, and chant: Malaclypse, Malaclypse, Malaclypse,\nMalaclypse, Malaclypse.\n\nBlink rapidly, as if you’re trying to get spots out of your eyes.\n\nOnce your ritual or meditation is complete, you can dismiss the Apostles\nthusly:\n\nFace the east, raise your arms in salute, and shout (or whisper with intent,\nif you’ve got roommates): Thank you for hearing this rite, Hung Mung! So long!\n\nTurn to the south and shout: Thank you for censing this rite, Van Van Mojo!\nFarewell!\n\nTurn to the west and shout: Thank you for spicing this rite, Sri Syadasti! Auf\nWiedersehen!\n\nTurn to the north and shout: Thank you for stoking this rite, Zarathud! Good\nnight!\n\nPoint your right hand to the ceiling and your left hand toward the ground and\nshout: Thank you for watching this rite, Malaclypse! The sun has gone to bed\nand so must I!\n\nOnce the circle is closed, you can go about the rest of your day or evening,\nsecure in the knowledge that the Discordian Apostles are aware of your\nexistence and grateful for your attention.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 5\n\n\n## Principles of\n\n## Chaos Witchcraft\n\nA principle is a foundational guideline that acts as part of the substructure\nof a belief system or practice. Principles set flexible boundaries that define\na conceptual thing, and they prevent it from being misidentified as any other\nthing.\n\nWithin the realm of Chaos Witchcraft, it is tempting to write off principles\nas nonessential, especially since the “whatever we want it to be” mentality is\nstill so pervasive in contemporary occultism. But even Discordianism, for all\nits inherent insanity, has principles in place to differentiate itself from\nother belief systems. Principles help explain what a given magical practice is\nand is not, which in turn will help you approach and apply it efficiently.\n\n## Hine Sight Is 20/20\n\nIn Condensed Chaos, Phil Hine offers six principles of Chaos Magic. They are\nas follows, in the order he presents them (although he makes it clear that\nthey are not set in stone and can be rearranged, emphasized, or discarded as\nnecessary):\n\nAvoidance of Dogma\n\nPersonal Experience\n\nTechnical Excellence\n\nDeconditioning\n\nDiverse Approaches\n\nGnosis\n\nTo Hine’s list of principles, I’m going to add two more:\n\nImmersion\n\nDiscipline\n\nLet’s consider them individually and see how they are applicable to the work\nof the Chaos Witch.\n\n## Avoidance of Dogma\n\nChaos Witchcraft does not come with a set of built-in beliefs, nor is there a\nspecific Higher Power overseeing Chaos Witchcraft who dictates what we may or\nmay not do (not even Eris). Beliefs are subjective, and we can change our\nminds regarding what we believe whenever we need to. There is no right way to\npractice Chaos Witchcraft, and the big-time unexpected benefit of this is that\nit is okay to be wrong—anytime we’re wrong about something, we can learn from\nit and shift our beliefs accordingly.\n\n## Personal Experience\n\nThis is the “doing” aspect of Chaos Witchcraft. Remember how I mentioned that\nChaos Magic is results driven? We get those results by actively practicing and\nexperimenting with magic. Instead of just reading what other people (including\nme) have done and accepting it at face value, try things out, bend a few set\n“rules,” and find out what works for you.\n\nIncidentally, another part of personal experience is documentation: That is,\nwriting down all the things we’re doing. On one hand, this is so that we can\ntrack the results we’re getting, but it’s also so that we can have a record of\nthe routes we took to get to those results (and so that we don’t overlook any\nvariables along the way). If you want to practice Chaos Witchcraft, invest in\njournals; this is my sage advice to you.\n\n## Technical Excellence\n\nMaybe it’s because I’m a Virgo, or because I have OCD, or because I’m a Virgo\nwith OCD, but if I can’t do something perfectly on the first try, then I don’t\nwant to do it at all. And this is something I’ve really had to struggle with\nthroughout my occult career, because magic relies on both talent and skill,\nand skill takes time to develop.\n\nNone of us are going to be Grand High Chaos Witches right out of the gate. But\nwhat we can do is figure out where our talents and interests lie, focus our\nefforts there, document the outcomes of the work we do (see earlier), and then\nstart over and try again until we achieve the results we’re looking for. And\nthen do it again and again until we get those results consistently.\n\n## Deconditioning\n\nThis is the principle that most deserves its own chapter, but for the moment,\nI’ll just say this: Deconditioning is the process of becoming less attached to\ningrained attitudes and beliefs, so that we can view the world around us more\nobjectively. Our dominant society is based on Protestant-Christian ethics, and\nwhether we’re aware of it or not, those ethics have a massive influence on us.\nIn the United States, we allegedly have separation of Church and State, yet\nthe only religious observance recognized as a federal holiday is a Christian\none (Christmas Day). If we’re going to practice effective Chaos Witchcraft,\nwe’ve got to learn how to disengage from that conditioning.\n\n## Diverse Approaches\n\nWe’ve already determined that there is no one right way to practice Chaos\nWitchcraft, and since our beliefs are (ideally) malleable, we shouldn’t be\nafraid to think outside of the box—or just burn the box down—and explore\ndifferent techniques and systems to see which ones bring us the payoffs we’re\nafter. The downside is that this can quickly lead into some sticky territory\nbetween cultural appropriation and open/closed practices, which I’ll cover in\nchapter 9.\n\n## Gnosis\n\nGnosis is the easiest principle to explain, but the toughest to put into\npractice. Long story short, in the context of Chaos Witchcraft, gnosis is the\naltered state of consciousness necessary to work magic. If paradigm shifting\nis choosing which grid we look through, gnosis is changing the angle through\nwhich the grid is viewed.\n\nWe actually slip into gnosis all the time without realizing it—my personal\nfavorite permutation being highway hypnosis—but the trick is being able to\nreach gnosis on command, versus accidentally. There are people in this world\nwho can snap their fingers, and bam, ritual trance, ready to go. I am not one\nof those people. Instead, I rely on what are called inhibitory (passive) and\nexcitatory (active) exercises to get there.\n\nInhibitory exercises are used to calm the mind and facilitate a meditative\nstate. Deep breathing, for instance, is inhibitory, as is staring into a\ncandle flame for an extended length of time. Excitatory exercises, by\ncomparison, get the blood flowing. Think of how ecstatic it feels to attend a\nconcert, as you and the rest of the audience dance and sing along with the\nperformers. A runner’s high—the euphoria experienced by some athletes during\nor immediately following strenuous activity—is another example of an\nexcitatory state.\n\nYou know how, in every documentary about cults, they bring in a deprogrammer\nto talk about brainwashing? All those techniques—chanting, sleep deprivation,\ndiet restriction, etc.—are examples of things we can use as inhibitory and/or\nexcitatory pathways to gnosis. Although maybe try them out on your own, or\nwith a friend who has healthy boundaries. Please don’t join a cult. That would\nbe bad.\n\n## Immersion\n\nThis is the first of my own additions to the Chaos principles list. Whatever\nit is you’re studying as part of your Witchcraft practice, you should be\nwilling to go all in. There’s a misconception out there that Chaos Witchcraft\nrelies on laziness and half-hearted efforts, when in fact, the exact opposite\nis true: Chaotes will commit to their transient beliefs like nobody’s\nbusiness.\n\nLet’s look at it this way: Say I want to create my own Witchcraft Tradition. I\nwork out the basics, do some research and figure out how to cast a circle,\nassemble some tools, pull some rituals out of various books, dedicate myself\nto a goddess, and cobble it all together into a regular practice that works\nwell for me. This is an Eclectic approach.\n\nIf I do all these steps, then convert to Islam for six months so that I can\nget a better grip on salat (that is, requisite prayer five times a day), then\nbid Allah ma’a as-salama and switch back to Paganism to incorporate my\nexperiences into my personal Witchcraft practice, that’s a Chaos approach.\n\n## Discipline\n\nThis is the second of my amendments, which could also be called doggedness or\ndetermination. The gist is that if I were trying to come up with a new method\nof spellcasting, I would keep working at the technique until I’ve gotten the\nresults I’m looking for, ignoring adversity and not giving up until the work\nis completed. And then I would begin again and repeat the process to confirm\nthat those results are consistent.\n\nBut discipline also means keeping a healthy balance alive in my practice:\njuxtaposing between mirth and reverence; getting a kick out of what I’m doing\nwhile taking it seriously; finding sacredness in the impertinent and using\nthat as a source of power; reminding myself that nothing is true and\neverything is permitted, especially in moments when my rational mind is\nstomping its feet and shrieking, “No. Only one way. Must do things that way.”\n\nThere is no one way, especially when it comes to Chaos Witchcraft. But it’s\nstill a specific thing with its own parameters. And once you’re able to\nperceive them and work within them efficiently, you can Molotov cocktail those\nrestrictions and build something abominable and transcendent out of the ashes.\nAnd then do it all over again to prove that it works. And that, I think, is\nwhen no one will be able to argue you’re not practicing Chaos Witchcraft.\n\nNot even yours truly. And I’m pretty excited about that too.\n\n## Lust of Result\n\nSince you’ve been learning about principles, now is a good time to bring up a\ntopic more precautionary in nature. While not a principle in and of itself, it\nis something worth keeping in mind as you navigate Chaos Witchcraft.\n\nLust of result is exactly what it sounds like: being so emotionally invested\nin the outcome of a magical working that the working itself is negated.\n\nIt does seem contradictory—after all, shouldn’t you want your spells to work?\nOf course you should! But if you get tangled up in fantasizing about what\nyou’re going to do if-and-when-and-if a given spell achieves its purpose, or\nif you start worrying about whether or not you did enough to manifest your\ngoals, you’re decreasing the probability of achieving them.\n\nSometimes, when I have a particular spell in mind, I research and cross-\nreference and dig up herbal correspondences and planetary associations and\nswipe incantations out of old grimoires and rewrite them for the task at hand\nand fixate on incense blends and generally just let my hyperfocus run wild.\nHowever, once the spell is cast, and once the candles melt away or the burnt\nofferings set off the smoke detector, I set everything aside and move on,\nletting the magic work without any further interference on my part. And it was\na challenge to learn how to do that, but it was vital if I was going to\nprogress as a Witch.\n\nWhen you cast a spell, you need to do so with utmost confidence (not\ncockiness, mind you; just confidence), and lust of result gets in the way of\nthat. It’s a lot like shooting a gun—I can stress over my ability to use the\ngun correctly, and let my anxiety get the better of me, and get so worked up\nthat I become a danger to myself and others. Or, I can take a deep breath,\nclear my head, aim, and pull the trigger, which will dramatically increase my\nchance of hitting my target.\n\nHaving been to a gun range before, I can say that my first couple of shots\nwere like, “Aaaaaahhh, I am wielding a loaded weapon, and I am uncomfortable.”\nBut once I settled down and focused, I was able to zero in on what I was\ndoing; my aim improved, and\n\nI got sort of good at it. And it’s honestly the same with Witchcraft. It just\ntakes patience and practice.\n\nSometimes, a spell hits just right and sets off a chain reaction. All the\nnecessary coincidences fall into place, and everything works out in such a\nspectacular way that witnesses are like, “How the heck did that happen?” This\nis my favorite thing in the whole world.\n\nOther times, the spell lands, but the odds of success are too low for magic to\nmake any difference. This does not mean that your Witchcraft is flawed, or\nthat lust of result got the better of you. There were just too many variables\nin play for the spell to have any real influence.\n\nAuthor and matchmaker Tracy McMillan once said, “Everything works out in the\nend; if it hasn’t worked out yet, then it’s not the end.”²⁸ And this is\napplicable to magic along with relationships, especially when you’re trying to\nfind detours around variables to achieve the results you’re working for.\n\nJust remember that every spell makes a difference, and every possibility can\nbe rerouted. And as a Chaos Witch, no magical operation is over until you say\nit is.\n\nIf it hasn’t worked out yet, if the obstacles and variables have not been\nidentified and circumvented, then you can rest assured that it’s not the end.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## Seeing Is Believing\n\nAt some point in your Witchcraft career, you’ll more than likely find yourself\nhaving to do some magic in which emotional investment is unavoidable: a spell\nto get your dream job; healing for your best friend; protection from bears, if\nbears are an issue in your area. In these moments, being really, really\ndesperate for the magic to work will be a distraction and a detraction.\n\nLuckily, I have a trick to overcome this. An excellent way to develop your\npotential for nonattachment is to cast spells for things in which you’re not\nemotionally invested, so that you can get familiar with that mindset and\nrecall it whenever necessary.\n\nThink of a simple desire (I say “desire” instead of “intent,” because “desire”\nhas a little more oomph to it), one that’s specific but won’t have any major\nimpact on your life. For example: “Within three days, I will see a cherry-red\nconvertible.”\n\nWrite down your desire on a piece of paper and cross out all the repeating\nletters, which, in this case, leaves the following jumble:\n\nW I T H N R E D\n\nA Y S L C O V B\n\nNext, start moving the letters around in different sequences and arrangements,\nconnecting them to each other, and letting your imagination take the wheel\nuntil you hit upon a design that seems right to you. Mine is a grumpy deep-sea\ncreature refusing a generic sleep aid:\n\n![](../Images/image-HN8AH414.png)\n\nConvertible Sigil\n\nBefore we go any farther, let’s take a step back and look at the desire\nitself. It is an improbable objective, but not an impossible one, and the\nspecific color mentioned, along with the three-day timeline, magnifies the\nimprobability. In other words, if the desire was just “I will see a red\nconvertible,” and you saw a brick-red convertible a year and a half later, you\nwouldn’t really know whether it was the spell or coincidence.\n\nThe timeline also provides some wiggle room to put the spell out of your mind\nafter you cast it and go about other business, with the understanding that the\nspell will work sooner than later—but probably not immediately. You may find\nthat as you work on your design, you disassociate a little and almost forget\nwhy you created it in the first place. But that’s a good thing, because it\nmeans you’re getting into a gnostic headspace.\n\nOnce your design is set, take a deep breath and blow vigorously onto it, fold\nit up, put it in your pocket, and move on with the rest of your day. Keep an\neye out for red convertibles, and when you do see one, let that excitement\nbolster your own confidence in your magic. Trust that the spell will work,\nwith your disengagement from the outcome playing a big part in that.\n\nThere’s an unfounded but persistent concept out in Greater Pagandom that magic\nshould only be used as a last resort, when all else fails. But magic is a\ncraft, and just like any other extracurricular activity, time and effort are\nrequired to improve our skills—which we should be doing whenever we can, not\njust when we have to.\n\nHaving disciplined yourself, you’ll be able to shift into nonattachment mode\nand practice quantitative Witchcraft to the best of your ability whenever\nyou’d like. And when that happens, the results you need will be inevitable.\n\n## The Law of Fives\n\nGuidelines and suggestions aside, there is one nonnegotiable law in Chaos\nWitchcraft. By this point, you may have noticed that the number five and\nmultiples thereof have popped up a lot in this book: Eris was pregnant for\nfifty-five years and gave birth to five Elements; Order is represented by the\nfive-sided pentagon; there are five seasons, each with seventy-three days\n(7+3=10); there are five Apostles, one of whom penned the Five Commandments;\nand if we count the introduction and conclusion, this book, published in 2025,\nhas fifteen chapters.\n\nThis is all thanks to the Law of Fives, which is not really a principle per\nse. But it is a fundamental tenet of Discordianism, and as such, it deserves\nits own plug. According to the Principia, the Law of Fives states simply that\n“all things happen in fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of five, or\nare somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to five. The Law of Fives is\nnever wrong.”²⁹\n\nAstute readers will note that the word five appears five times in the passage,\nthus proving the Law of Fives.\n\nOn the surface, the Law of Fives appears to be a parody of scientific reliance\non the number four—four Elements, four humors, four seasons, etc.—as well as a\npoke at the inherent obscenity of four-letter words. But the number five does\nhistorically, or at least mythologically, relate to Eris.\n\nIn his Works and Days, Hesiod wrote, “Beware of all the fifth days [of the\nmonth]; for they are harsh and angry; it was on the fifth, they say, that the\nErinyes (Furies) assisted at the bearing of Horkos, whom Eris bore, to be a\nplague on those who take false oath.”³⁰\n\nWhether or not the founders of Discordianism were aware of the connection\nbetween Eris and the fifth day of the month is anyone’s guess, although it\ndoes bulk up the modern association with some nifty historical context. And\neven if the number was picked arbitrarily, the Law of Fives does provide us\nwith an opportunity to control how we perceive the world around us—basically,\nyou can make anything relate to the number five if you try hard enough.\n\nFor example, the number 23 is sacred within Discordianism, because 2+3=5. And\nthe number 24 relates to the number 5, because 24–1=23, and 2+3=5. And the\nnumber 378 relates to 5, because 3+7+8=18, and 1+8=9, and 9 is only 1 number\naway from 10, which is a multiple of 5. And so on.\n\nMaking the conscious decision to see the number five everywhere we look is an\nexample of controlling our beliefs, which is another step toward using those\nbeliefs as tools. Although if you want to see Discordianism in real-world\naction, do some research on the 23 Enigma, which is a metaphysical theory that\nthe number 23 is deeply but inexplicably significant. Digging into the 23\nEnigma will yield stories that make the Law of Fives seem a lot more\nreasonable than anyone ever intended.\n\nAnd here’s the best part: From a practical Witchcraft standpoint, the Law of\nFives is a Golden Ticket and Get Out of Jail Free Card rolled into one (or\nfive).\n\nHow many herbs should you put in a charm bag? Five. How many nights should you\nlight candles for your petitions? Five. How many times should you chant the\nwords to a given spell? Five. How many days should you commit to a paradigm\nshift before deciding whether it’s going to be valuable to your practice?\nFive. How many times should you text an unrequited crush before you accept\nthat they’re not going to text back? Five.\n\nIn 2024, I gave a presentation on Discordianism at an event called Austin\nWitchfest, and after I got through talking about the Law of Fives, an attendee\nraised his hand.\n\n“We’re in Room 5,” he noted. “Did you pick this room on purpose?”\n\n“I actually did not,” I said, explaining that I was originally supposed to be\nin Room 1, but I’d received an email from the organizers on the Friday before\nthe event, letting me know that the assignments had been rearranged, and I’d\nnow be presenting in Room 5.\n\nAt which point another attendee spoke up: “So you found out you’d be in Room 5\n… on the fifth day of the week.”\n\n“That is correct,” I said.\n\nAnd the whole room gasped like I’d just casually levitated.\n\nThey all may have shown up to my presentation as mild curiosity seekers, but\nthey left as believers. As a Chaos Witch, this was really all I could have\nasked for.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## Anointings Anonymous\n\nNow that you’re working on your nonattachment abilities, you can level up and\nstart casting spells without knowing what spells you’re casting.\n\nSounds fun, right? I think so too.\n\n## You will need\n\nA plain carrier oil, such as almond or olive\n\nFive identical tealights and/or papers\n\nAluminum foil and/or butcher paper\n\n## Directions\n\nThink of a desire, and once it’s fully formed in your mind, dab your finger in\nthe oil and rub it in a circle around the top rim of one of the tealights—make\na clockwise circle if the desire involves bringing something to you, and make\na counterclockwise circle if the desire involves sending something away from\nyou. Then wrap the tealight in aluminum foil or butcher paper (or anything\nnonabsorbent) and put it away. Do this with one of the tealights every night\nfor five nights. Wait five more days, then select one of the candles and light\nit. Again, let your concentration settle on the work, not the outcome. Note\nany results.\n\nInstead of candles, you can also write down a series of five simple desires\nand create a design for each one, like you did for the spell to see the red\nconvertible. Once you’ve got a good selection of them, mix them up and set\nthem aside for a week or so. After some time has passed, pull one at random,\nblow on it, and tear it up or burn it to release its potential. Repeat this\nevery day with a different design, until you start getting comfortable with\nthe work itself instead of the desire being the focus of your attention.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 6\n\n\n## The Chaos\n\n## Star and Discordian\n\n## Diamond\n\nPicture an octopus. It can drastically change its appearance, and it can\nsqueeze itself into almost anything. But regardless of what it happens to look\nlike or where it happens to have hidden itself at any given moment, it is\nstill, at its core, an octopus. That’s because it has defining\ncharacteristics: Its adaptability and morphology, along with its ability to\nmimic whatever it wants, are the very things that fundamentally make it an\noctopus.\n\nJust as you can look at an octopus in its original form and recognize it by\nits oval head and weird beak and eight tentacles, so too can we look at the\noverall shape and colors of Chaos Witchcraft to identify and understand how to\napply it. To start, let’s look at a star.\n\n## The Chaos Star\n\nThe design that came to be known as the Chaos Star was originally devised in\nthe early 1960s by writer Michael Moorcock for his Elric of Melniboné stories.\nThe symbol trickled from fiction to appear iconically in the Warhammer role-\nplaying game, and it eventually wriggled its way into occultism, where it\nfinally solidified as a symbol of Chaos Magic. It is also known as the\nChaostar and the Sigil of Chaos, and if it’s mapped out three-dimensionally,\nit’s called a Chaosphere.\n\n![star](../Images/image-OWNW404Q.png)\n\nThe Chaos Star\n\nThe Star does not really have a concrete meaning, although you can certainly\nextract a variety of interpretations out of it. The arrows can represent the\neight points of the compass, or the symbol as a whole can represent the big\nbang, with matter and energy launching ballistically in all directions. Or you\ncan look at it as a representation of Chaos itself, being the potential and\nmomentum behind all action with no specific destination in mind, other than\nwherever you decide to take it.\n\n## The Colors\n\nIn Liber Kaos, Peter J. Carroll expands on the Star by adding color to the\narrows to represent eight different forms of magic.³¹ I’ve listed them with\none notable change: Instead of associating green with love, I’m going to\nassociate green with partnership (and I will talk about why a little later).\n\n![star](../Images/image-TTU6113V.png)\n\nThe Chaos Star with Colors Listed\n\nOctarine—Pure Magic. The integration of the self and connection to the Divine,\nwhich Ceremonial Magicians call the Great Work. According to Sir Terry\nPratchett in his Discworld series, octarine is a greenish yellow-purple that\ndenotes the presence of magical energy. It is only visible to wizards and\ncats.³²\n\nBlack—Death Magic. Necromancy, mediumship, and vampirism.\n\nBlue—Wealth Magic. Money and prosperity.\n\nGreen—Partnership Magic. Developing and/or maintaining relationships,\nincluding those with plants and animals.\n\nYellow—Ego Magic. Knowledge, success, illumination, and illusions.\n\nPurple—Sex Magic. Self-explanatory, but also Creation, creativity, and\nfertility.\n\nOrange—Thinking Magic. Responsibility, strategy, travel, gambling, and risk-\ntaking.\n\nRed—War Magic. Conflict, defense, and protection.\n\nIf you’re familiar with Hermetic Qabalah, you will notice that the colors of\nthe arrows match those of the seven classical planets associated with the\nsepiroth, or spheres, of the Tree of Life. The difference, though, is that in\na Qabalistic system, you’d be pathworking your way up the Tree, whereas in\nChaos Magic, you can shoot off in whichever direction is most appropriate for\nthe results you’re trying to achieve.\n\nHow you use the colors of the Chaos Star is entirely up to you, and you can\neven choose to use them literally. For instance, if you were doing a ritual to\nprotect investments, you might consider employing red and blue candles, cords,\ndyed oils, and so on in your work while invoking spirits of war and wealth.\nOr, since red + blue = purple, you could use Purple Magic to create\nopportunities for your investments to grow without interference.\n\nThe point here is that once you’ve got the structure of the colors down, you\ncan do a lot of awesome stuff within it.\n\n## The Arrows\n\nThe arrows of the Star are not static, and in Chaos Craft: The Wheel of the\nYear in Eight Colours, authors Julian Vayne and Steve Dee rearrange the\ncolors, while keeping the polarities intact, to align them with the\ncontemporary Wiccan Sabbats, like so:\n\nOctarine—Winter Solstice, sometimes called Yule\n\n(December 21)\n\nGreen—Imbolc (February 1)\n\nOrange—Spring Equinox, sometimes called Ostara\n\n(March 21)\n\nPurple—Beltane (May 1)\n\nYellow—Summer Solstice, sometimes called Litha (June 21)\n\nRed—Lammas (August 1)\n\nBlue—Autumnal Equinox, sometimes called Mabon\n\n(September 21)\n\nBlack—Samhain (November 1)\n\nWithin this paradigm, the magic being practiced corresponds to the cyclical\ncelebrations. Since Lammas is a time of sacrifice, you could take the\nopportunity for a red ritual to venerate Mars (who is the plow as well as the\nsword); or, during Samhain, your magic would be black, in that it’s the time\nto honor and commune with the dead. In these cases, the magic is bolstered by\nthe season, making a Witch’s work even more effective.\n\n![star](../Images/image-1HCLJ5BX.jpg)\n\nThe Chaos Star and its eight magics is a perfectly actionable framework, and\nif you want to use it as the backbone of your own Chaos Witchcraft, you are\nmore than welcome to do so. But nothing within Chaos Magic is set in stone,\nand there’s no reason not to come up with your own way of categorizing magic\nthat’s unique to Chaos Witchcraft.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## Barbarous Fnords\n\nThe word fnord first appeared on page 00010 of the Principia as a bit of\namusing gibberish. However, Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea made use of\nthe term in The Illuminatus! Trilogy, defining it as a written tool that\ncreates a subconscious plant in a subject’s mind. According to these novels,\nchildren are conditioned from an early age not to be able to see the word, so\nwhenever it appears in print media, it causes discomfort and anxiety.³³\nTherefore, shadowy organizations work to distribute the word throughout\nnewspapers and magazine articles so that the unenlightened will be averse to\nreading about current events. But it is not used in any form of advertising,\nthus encouraging consumerism.\n\nDiscordians use fnord as an all-purpose injection, exclamation, and expletive,\nagain with no particular definition. But Wilson and Shea ascribed power to the\nword, which means that Chaos Witches can do the same.\n\nWithin the occult, a barbarous name is a nonsensical word that has no inherent\nmeaning but becomes meaningful in a ritual context: The word transmits magic\nby how it is uttered and the force of will behind it.³⁴ Traditional Witches\nand Wiccans often end their spells with the phrase so mote it be, which\ntranslates to, “This spell will come to pass.” Instead of ending your own\nspells with that phrase, try using fnord as a barbarous name and shouting it\nwith all the intensity you can muster. Shift your beliefs so that the word\nmeans exactly what you want it to mean, and nothing less.\n\n## Tidal Waves\n\nIn Lid Off the Cauldron: A Handbook for Witches, Patricia Crowther divides the\nWheel of the Year into four seasonal tides: the Tide of Activation (from the\nSpring Equinox to the Summer Solstice), the Tide of Consolidation (from the\nSummer Solstice to the Autumn Equinox), the Tide of Recession (from the Autumn\nEquinox to the Winter Solstice), and the Tide of Lustration (from the Winter\nSolstice to the Spring Equinox). Crowther encourages Witches to keep the tides\nin mind—along with lunar phases and planetary positions—when planning the\ntiming of magical workings, pointing out that the apex of each tide—and thus\nthe most auspicious time for a corresponding magical operation—is one of the\nGreater Sabbats (Activation/Beltane, Consolidation/Lammas, Recession/Samhain,\nand Lustration/Imbolc).\n\nIf we want to bring some Traditional Witchcraft into our Chaos Witchcraft, we\ncan capture the idea of seasonal tides, frappe it within a Chaos paradigm, and\nreinterpret it with the Discordian seasons. We can also look to the lesser-\nknown Honest Book of Truth (the full text of which can be found in Historia\nDiscordia by Adam Gorightly), in which Lord Omar described the Discordian\nseasons as Ages, to get an idea of how these tides might operate.\n\n## An Age of Chaos\n\n“An Age of Chaos is one in which Things Seem Ready to Happen and, a midst much\nactivity, no specific Direction seemeth yet to be emerging. These are Ages of\nBalance, wherein one action negates another in the Eye of the Observer, who\ndoes not yet exist.”³⁵\n\n## An Age of Discord\n\n“An Age of Discord is one wherein Something Happens to Activate the Cycle of\nEvents and the main theme of Whatever Is Coming begins to reveal Itself. These\nare also known as Primitive Ages, coming as they do after the Primal Ages of\nChaos, and they are Ages of Unbalance as well.”³⁶\n\n## An Age of Confusion\n\n“An Age of Confusion or an Ancient Age, is one in which History As We Know It\nbegins to unfold, in which Whatever Is Coming emerges in Corporal Form, more\nor less, and such times are Ages of Balanced Unbalance, or Unbalanced\nBalance.”³⁷\n\n## An Age of Bureaucracy\n\n“Age of Bureaucracy is an Imperial Age in which Things Mature, in which\nConfusion becomes entrenched, and during which Balanced Balance, or\nStagnation, is attained.”³⁸\n\n## An Age of Aftermath\n\n“An Age of Aftermath is an Apocalyptic Period of Transition back to Chaos\nthrough the Screen of Oblivion into which passeth, finally. These are the Ages\nof Unbalanced Balance.”³⁹\n\n![](../Images/image-YW4QCC9D.jpg)\n\nThere are two ways to understand the tidal powers of the Discordian seasons.\nOn one hand, you can time your magic to correspond with the Discordian\ncalendar: For instance, a spell to get a promotion at work would represent\nmaturation and could therefore be cast during the Season of Bureaucracy for\nmaximum impact. On the other hand, you can think of the Discordian seasons not\njust when things can happen, but how those things can happen.\n\nIn other words, the Discordian seasons are distinct expressions of magic.\n\n## Diamonds Are a Discordian’s Best Friend\n\nHow do the Discordian seasonal forms of magic relate to the eight forms of\nmagic on the Chaos Star? Let’s overlay them and find out.\n\n![](../Images/image-58N5DPLV.png)\n\nThe Discordian Diamond\n\nIn this reimagining, the Discordian seasons are not set points, but spectrums\naround the Star. Discord, for example, connects death and wealth, whereas\nbureaucracy runs the gamut from ego to sex to thinking. And this means that we\ncan use the seasons to complement—or even replace—the forms of magic\nsymbolized by the Star. In fact, let’s fall back on our Principle of Diverse\nApproaches, cull an idea from Scottish Witchcraft: The History and Magick of\nthe Picts by Raymond Buckland, and apply it completely out of context to\nconfirm our theory, “[W]e might say that there are five main headings for\nmagick to be worked. These are: HEALTH, WEALTH, LOVE, PROTECTION, POWER.”⁴⁰\n\nIf we match those headings up with the Discordian seasons, update a couple of\nwords, and take Lord Omar’s Ages into account, we end up with the following:\n\nPure Chaos—Power\n\nDiscord—Fortune (we’ve already got wealth, plus fortune can be either good or\nbad)\n\nConfusion—Love (this is why we changed green to partnership)\n\nBureaucracy—Health (a figurative or literal body’s hierarchical systems of\norganization)\n\nAftermath—Protection\n\nThis leaves us with either five bonus forms of magic to add to the eight\npoints of the Chaos Star, or five broad forms of magic that encompass the\nChaos Star completely, both of which provide a robust configuration for Chaos\nWitchcraft. But because our emphasis is on experimenting with unfamiliar\nideas, and because we’ve been rolling with Discordianism, I am going to focus\non that second take.\n\n## Discordian Spells for All Occasions\n\nHereare some examples of what Discordian Seasonal Magic can look like.\n\n## Pure Chaos Magic: Set Things in Motion\n\nThis is a spell of beginnings to be cast when you’re preparing to start a new\nproject or set off on an adventure. Perform this working so that things will\nfall into place for you.\n\n## You will need\n\nA white seven-day candle\n\nA black permanent marker\n\nAnointing oil\n\nA domino\n\n## Directions\n\nOn the side of the candle, use the marker to draw two arrows crashing into\neach other, shown here:\n\n![](../Images/image-RYE49M1D.png)\n\nDab your finger in the oil and touch the top of the candle five times, like\npips on a die: twice above the wick, once at the base of the wick, and twice\nbelow it. On a table, or on your altar if you have one, set the domino on end.\nImagine a series of events, like a movie montage, leading up to the result\nyou’re trying to accomplish. Once those events are clear in your mind, light\nthe candle, then pick it up with both hands. Use the base of the candle to\nknock over the domino. Let the candle burn down. See what happens.\n\n## Discord Magic: The Stench of Success\n\nThis is a spell to tip fortune in your favor, to bring in some extra money or\nresources when needed, and to help that income grow.\n\n## You will need\n\nA strong-smelling incense, such as nag champa\n\nA bay leaf\n\nA blue or green scented marker\n\nYour favorite cologne\n\n## Directions\n\nLight the incense. Take a moment to savor the fragrance. Pick up the bay leaf,\nhold it close to your face, and inhale deeply. Using the marker, draw a symbol\nof wealth on the bay leaf—this could be a dollar sign, the astrological symbol\nof Jupiter, a sigil of your own creation, or a combination of all.\n\nHold the bay leaf over the incense, letting the smoke curl over both sides.\nSpritz the bay leaf with cologne, then take another whiff of the leaf,\ninhaling deeply through your nose. Exhale through your mouth, blowing your\ndesire onto the leaf.\n\nBury the leaf by your front door. Wear the cologne for the next five days.\n\n## Confusion Magic: Sticky-Sweet Glamour\n\nA glamour is a spell that changes how the Witch who casts it appears to the\npeople around them. This glamour is intended to increase your confidence and\ndraw favorable attention.\n\n## You will need\n\nA bathtub\n\nA can of Dr Pepper\n\nA small paper heart\n\n## Directions\n\nRemove your clothes and get comfortable in the tub. Hold the can of Dr Pepper\nto your forehead and concentrate on how you want to be perceived, and what\nkind of attention you want to attract. Once you feel ready, crack open the Dr\nPepper, take a sip, and slowly pour it over yourself, feeling the twenty-three\nflavors bubbling and sticking to you, like an additional layer of skin that\nyou can reshape however you’d like. Finish up by bathing as you normally\nwould. Recycle the can with the paper heart inside.\n\n## Bureaucracy Magic: Bound and Gagged\n\nOutside of the occult, the word bureaucracy is synonymous with red tape, which\nis the inspiration behind this binding spell. Cast it to bog down or otherwise\nprevent a given something or someone from reaching you.\n\n## You will need\n\nA poseable doll or action figure representative of your target ⁴¹\n\nWater\n\nMasking tape\n\n## Directions\n\nName the toy after your target. If you really want to go big, you can perform\nan entire baptismal rite out of The Book of Common Prayer like they did in the\nnovel The Witches of Eastwick by John Updike. But if you’re cramped for time,\njust dab a little water on the doll’s forehead and say, “By Bureaucracy made,\nby Bureaucracy changed. You are not [whatever the toy is made from], but flesh\nand blood. I name you [name of target]. You are they.”\n\nTake your masking tape and wrap it haphazardly around the toy five times, with\nthe majority of the tape going around the arms and legs. Once the poppet is\ntrussed up to your liking, place it in the very back of your freezer, using\nwhatever else you happen to have in there to create a blockade around it.\n\n## Aftermath Magic: Defensive Optic Blast\n\nThis is a pop culture twist on a talisman meant to ward off the Evil Eye. Keep\nit near the front of your home to boost protection.\n\n## You will need\n\nAn iron nail\n\nA small orange bag\n\nA picture of your favorite superhero with vision- or light-based powers\n(Superman, Cyclops, Dazzler, etc.)\n\nRed thread\n\nHot sauce\n\n## Directions\n\nPlace the iron nail at the bottom of the bag. Gaze at the picture of the\nsuperhero, making eye contact with the image, then fold it five times and\nslide it into the bag as well. Use the thread to tie off the bag with five\nknots. Anoint both sides of the bag with a drop of hot sauce, then hang it in\na visible location. Warning: Wash your hands before touching your eyes.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## Customizing Your Colors\n\nThere’s absolutely nothing wrong with using prefab color correspondences, but\nsince Chaos Witchcraft is experimental by nature, you are free to come up with\nyour own to see how they work for you. Here’s a way to give that a whirl.\n\nOn a sheet of paper, write down the following:\n\nYour least favorite color.\n\nA color you associate with opulence.\n\nThe color that looks best on you.\n\nA color you wear when you want to be taken seriously (your power color).\n\nA sensual color—or, alternatively, a color you associate with creativity.\n\nA color that makes you think of a finish line.\n\nA color that makes you angry.\n\nYour favorite color.\n\nWhat you have created, then, is a set of colors that keys into each form of\nmagic on the Chaos Star in your own terms. As an example, here are my colors:\nsalmon, crimson, navy blue, charcoal, fuchsia, white, burnt orange, aqua. For\nme, these resonate as death (salmon), wealth (crimson), partnership (navy\nblue), ego (charcoal), sex (fuchsia), thinking (white), war (burnt orange),\nand Pure Magic (aqua).\n\nNow, try this exercise again, but this time with a shorter list of criteria:\n\nA garish color.\n\nA color that clashes with the garish color.\n\nThe color of your favorite dessert.\n\nA healthy color.\n\nA color that makes you feel safe.\n\nWhat you are left with is a set of colors specifically relating to the\nDiscordian forms of magic. Mine are neon yellow, grey, pumpkin, forest green,\nchartreuse. For me, this means Pure Chaos (neon yellow), discord (grey),\nconfusion (pumpkin), bureaucracy (forest green), and aftermath (chartreuse).\n\nThese color stories can be used when picking out candles for spellwork, or\nwhen choosing particular inks with which to draw sigils. You may find that one\ncolor fills multiple slots—maybe your favorite color also happens to be the\ncolor that looks best on you. And that’s okay! There’s absolutely nothing\nsaying that we can’t utilize a single color for more than one magical purpose.\nThis is all about what works for you in your practice, not what works for\nanyone else in theirs.\n\nAnd if you can’t come up with a color for every association, or you don’t want\nto rely on correspondences at all, I promise that’s okay too. In this case, we\ncan fall back on one of the fundamental maxims of fashion:\n\nBeige goes with everything.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 7\n\n\n## Sigils,\n\n## Servitors, and Symbols\n\nThe Chaos approach can really be applied to any magical practice, although\nthere are some techniques developed by early Chaos Magicians—specifically\nthose involving the creation of sigils and servitors—that eventually found\ntheir way into the occult mainstream. And that has resulted in a bit of\nstagnation, especially when Witches started to believe that these techniques\ncould not be altered or amended in any way.\n\nLet me be clear: When it comes to the Creative processes of Chaos Witchcraft,\nthere are no correct ways to do anything. There are ways of doing things that\nmay prove more effective than others, but ultimately, whatever you’re doing\nonly has to work for you. If you are getting the results you want, no one can\ntell you that your methods are wrong.\n\nThere are also a metric frackton of resources out there regarding sigils and\nservitors, so with some digging, you are all but guaranteed to find systems\nthat work perfectly for you. And hey, if you don’t, you can always do what the\noriginal Chaotes did and invent your own. In fifty years, maybe some hardcore\nChaos dude will be swearing to his friends that the method you devised is the\nonly way to make sigils.\n\n## Sigils\n\nWithin Chaos Magic and Chaos Witchcraft, a sigil is a visual representation of\na desire, created to bring that desire into reality. The most recognizable\nmethod of sigilization was originally devised by Austin Osman Spare and\nrefined by Ray Sherwin, and I touched on it in the Discordian Dance Break in\nChapter 5 (page 71). Using this method, you will write down your desire, cross\nout repeating letters, then play around with the arrangement of the letters\nuntil you come up with an integrated design that incorporates all of them.\n\n## Pictorial Sigils\n\nAt its core, a sigil is a symbol of a desired outcome, but we don’t\nnecessarily have to write out that desire to get results. We can 100 percent\ndraw it instead.\n\nPictorial sigils are sympathetic in nature. The Witch sketches out a depiction\nof what they want to see happen, and then that image is broken down and\nconsolidated into a simple, abstract motif—one that represents their goal just\nas emphatically as a sigil created with letters would. It’s a very “as above,\nso below” kind of working, and it lends itself to a lot of expressiveness and\noriginality.\n\nAnd please note that you don’t have to be a talented artist to pull this off:\nA stick figure drawing would honestly make a more practical template for a\npictorial sigil than a fine art portrait, because the overall design would be\na lot more straightforward and pliable.\n\nI generally have not had a lot of success with pictorial sigils, but I’ve also\nfound a method that does work for me. If other systems of sigil creation\nhaven’t done much for you in the past, give pictorial sigils a try and see\nwhat results you can generate.\n\n## Scrigils\n\nThis is my all-time favorite method of sigil generation, and I have never\ngotten anything but spectacular results from it. Plus, it’s incredibly simple:\nGrab a pen and a piece of paper, clear your mind, close your eyes, think about\nyour desire, then pick up the pen and let your hand gently start moving it\naround the paper, in whatever direction it wants to go.\n\nLet your desire play out like a movie, audiobook, or tasting menu while your\nhand meanders, until the story organically comes to its conclusion. Stop\ndrawing. Open your eyes and admire your new scrigil.\n\n![](../Images/image-HEETYH28.png)\n\nA Scribbled Sigil on a Jack in the Box Napkin.\n\nPhoto provided by author\n\nI honestly couldn’t tell you why this method works so well for me, but the\nspells I’ve cast using scrigils have always hit their marks. If this ends up\nnot being your thing, no worries—you’ve got plenty of other options from which\nto choose.\n\n## Charging and Firing\n\nSo, you’ve got your sigil (or scrigil) ready, and it’s time to move forward.\nHere’s what to do to fully cast your spell.\n\nSit comfortably, with your back straight and your feet touching the floor.\nHold your sigil in front of you, keeping your eyes focused on it. Take a deep\nbreath, and, starting with your feet, tighten your muscles as hard as you can,\nfeeling that tightness move up your body, until every muscle is clenched. Hold\nthis for as long as possible. Once you can’t keep clenched any longer, relax\nand exhale sharply, blowing all the air in your lungs onto the sigil.\n\nRepeat this procedure two more times. I would normally say four more times to\nkeep things in line with the Law of Fives, but I also don’t want you to\nhyperventilate. After the third expulsion of air onto your sigil, it will be\ncharged.\n\nThe next step is to fire it—the method of which will depend on the form of\nmagic aligned with the goal of your spellwork: If the spell is Pure Chaos or\nAftermath Magic, the sigil should be burned. If the spell is Confusion or\nBureaucracy Magic, the sigil should be buried. If the spell is Discord Magic,\nthe sigil can either be burned or buried, on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## A Better Word\n\nOkay, let’s take our foot off the gas for a second. Within the realm of occult\nhow-to books, you will often come across the word visualize, which means “to\nsee something in your mind’s eye”: Visualize the results of your spell, or\nvisualize the person you want to be. Basically, picture it.\n\nThing is, not everyone can picture it. People with aphantasia—the inability to\nvisualize—don’t see mental pictures at all. But this does not mean that they\ncan’t practice Witchcraft, nor should any of us be solely dependent on mental\nimages for our spells to work.\n\nEris gave us five senses, and since input to any of them can trigger memories,\nall of them can be used to create imaginary depictions of the events we want\nto make happen. You have just as much potential to hear or feel or taste or\nsmell your desire as you do to see it, so instead of lumping all those skills\nunder the misnomer of visualization, let’s group them under a more accurate\nand inclusive word: foretelling. When you’re casting a spell, foretell the\nresults you want to achieve, using whichever senses make the most sense to\nyou.\n\n## Verbal Sigils\n\nOne of the first occult books I ever bought was The Magick of Chant-O-Matics\nby Raymond Buckland. It’s as campy as the title suggests, and very much a\nproduct of its time, but it did get me in the habit of actively stating my\ndesires out loud when doing spellwork. Verbal sigils are not a far leap from\nthis concept.\n\nTo create verbal sigils, you can start with the standard sigil creation\nmethod, but instead of combining letters into a singular glyph, rearrange them\nto create a short chant or mantra. For instance, if you take the letters from\na phrase like I have all the money I need to afford a vacation, you can\nproduce any number of verbal sigils:\n\nCORF LATH MINDEV\n\nFEVCIN HARF MOLT\n\nLECT FINDAH VROM\n\nHI, VORM? CAD LEFT!\n\nVerbal sigils may be worked into rituals or spells however you see fit. But in\nkeeping with the innovations of Chaos Witchcraft, you might want to try\nsomething completely unorthodox with them, like standing on a median and\nshouting them five times into oncoming traffic.\n\n## Hypersigils\n\nComic book legend Grant Morrison originally coined the term hypersigil in\nreference to their series The Invisibles, the plotline of which was charged to\nbring about changes in Morrison’s reality: As the story evolved and developed,\nso did Morrison. A hypersigil works on the same principles as a regular sigil,\nin that it’s a symbolic representation of a desire. However, the difference\nbetween the two is that a hypersigil is fourth-dimensional; instead of being a\nstatic image, it has a narrative quality that propels it through time. It’s\nkind of like writing fanfic about yourself. Morrison explains it a lot better\nthan I can.\n\n“The hypersigil can take the form of a poem, a story, a song, a dance, or any\nother extended artistic activity you wish to try. This is a newly developed\ntechnology so the parameters remain to be explored … The hypersigil is a\ndynamic miniature model of the Magician’s universe, a hologram, microcosm or\n‘voodoo doll’ which can be manipulated in real time to produce changes in the\nmacrocosmic environment of ‘real’ life.”⁴²\n\nThe comic series Promethea presents a good example of hypersigils at work. In\nthose books, whenever someone writes a poem or a story about Promethea, she\nappears in the real world to fight evil. There’s a lot more to the story than\njust that, of course, but the gist is that Promethea is summoned by creative\nendeavors, which can serve as a bit of inspiration as you explore the concept\nof hypersigils yourself.\n\nAnd as you are poking around, keep in mind that social media provides a wealth\nof hypersigil potential. Consider a blog in which the author writes from the\nperspective of who they want to be, versus who they currently are. An entire\nbackstory could be crafted, with posts detailing, say, everything they did\nthat day at their dream job, or where they’re going for a romantic dinner with\ntheir idealized, yet-to-have-been-introduced partner.\n\nConsider the filters that alter photos however the user wishes, or the apps\nthat allow you to film and edit videos. In fact, try this:\n\nSigilize a desire using the verbal sigil technique described earlier in this\nchapter.\n\nPut together a video using your preferred app. The topic of the video can be\nwhatever you’d like.\n\nAdd a text box, then type in the words from your verbal sigil.\n\nSlide the text box offscreen. It will not be visible to your audience, but it\nwill remain part of the post.\n\nAdd any captions or hashtags relevant to the subject of the video, then post\nit.\n\nAnd with that, you will have set a hypersigil loose on the internet, and every\nlike, favorite, and share it receives will increase its power. The video can\nbe deleted once your results have been achieved.\n\n## Cut-Ups\n\nIf you’re old enough to remember when The Secret was all the rage, then you\nprobably also remember when vision boards were trending: big pieces of poster\nboard that people would decorate with words and phrases clipped from\nmagazines, along with stock photos that corresponded to whatever desires they\nwere trying to passively manifest.\n\nIn theory, cut-ups are similar to vision boards, although in practice, they’re\na lot more like ransom notes. In either case, a cut-up is basically a collage,\nassembled with a specific magical goal in mind.\n\nDevotional Cut-Up to Anteros,\n\nPersonification of Requited Love, by Scott Woodward\n\n![](../Images/image-RO2PW5GL.png)\n\nA cut-up can be simple or intricate, incorporating as many different words,\nsymbols, and images as you see fit. And a cut-up does not have to be limited\nto the visual: William Burroughs was known to create audio cut-ups by splicing\ndifferent sound recordings together—essentially creating an esoteric mix\ntape—then playing them out loud at the location where he wanted to see the\neffects of his magic. Burroughs also employed cut-ups as a literary technique,\nslicing up a written work into individual words, mixing them, and rearranging\nthem at random to create new poems. You can use this method as well, cutting\nsentences out of magazines or print newspapers, breaking them down to\nindividual words or letters, then placing them into a greater collage in\nwhatever sequence makes sense to your deep mind.\n\nMy only firm suggestion is that the size of the cut-up should be appropriate\nto the work you’re doing with it. If you’re making a cut-up for a single\nspell, it really shouldn’t be any bigger than a standard index card. If the\ncut-up is devotional in nature—assembled as an effigy of a particular deity,\nor to be used as an altar backdrop—then the cut-up can be made with a base of\nposter board, or even decoupaged on a wall. This example is a devotional cut-\nup to Anteros—the personification of requited love, by Scott Woodward.\n\nRegardless of what its purpose will be, the cut-up should always appeal to\nyour personal aesthetic sensibilities: You should like how it looks, and you\nshould like looking at it. And this is important, because if you created it\nfor a one-shot spell, you’re going to charge and fire the cut-up like you\nwould a sigil—which means destroying it. And that can be a hard thing to do,\nwhich makes it a sacrifice. And that Destructive sacrifice will add Creative\npower to your magic.\n\n## Servitors\n\nIn the short horror stories he penned for the magazine Weird Tales in the\n1930s, author Clark Ashton Smith referred to the undead minions of Sorcerers\nas servitors.⁴³ And at some indeterminable point, the word floated into Chaos\nMagic, where it was used to describe a semi-independent thoughtform\nconstructed to perform a specific task.\n\nThink of a servitor as a noncorporeal extension of yourself, with just enough\nagency to do its job without supervision while remaining under your full\ncontrol. A servitor can be created for any reason, although there are some\nthings to consider before you set about forging one of your own. These factors\nare foundation, purpose, programming, appearance, identity, lifespan, and\nactivation. Let’s look at them individually.\n\n## Foundation\n\nIf we’re going to build anything, we need something on which to construct it.\nThink about the Discordian Elements as described in chapter 2: Which of the\nfive relates to your servitor? If its primary goal is going to be, say,\nincreasing wealth, which corresponds with Discord Magic, you’ll want to focus\non Pungent; if it will act as a guardian, you’ll be drawing on Aftermath\nMagic, so the servitor will be built on Orange.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of your servitor is basically the same as the desire or intent\nbehind a spell. On a clean sheet of paper, write out that desire as a\ndirective. For example, “Help me bring in more money.” Or, “Keep solicitors\nand door-to-door salespeople away from my home.”\n\n## Programming\n\nSo now that you have a solid idea of your servitor’s magical foundation and\nspecific purpose, you can start collecting symbols that resonate with the job\nyou want the servitor to do, which will be used in the activation process.\n\nYou can create a sigil, or a scrigil, or bring in numerology or planetary\nglyphs, or anything else that would reinforce the purpose of the servitor.\nCombine those images however you’d like into one comprehensive metasigil that\nfeels right to you, and add that final design to the paper under the purpose.\n\n## Appearance\n\nYour servitor can take on any form you’d like, but for the sake of Chaos\nWitchcraft, you can draw inspiration from the Element providing its\nfoundation: an animated cloud of smoke for Pungent, a glowing orb for Orange,\nand so on. Or, if you’re up for it, you can also go crazy with details.\n\nI once made a servitor that looked like a softball-sized blue bumblebee, but\nI’ve made others that are just swirling balls of light. It’s likely no one\nother than you will ever see the servitor, so however you want it to appear is\ncompletely valid.\n\n## Identity\n\nWhat (or if) you decide to name your servitor is also completely up to you,\nalthough a memorable name will help reinforce its mission. One way to come up\nwith a name is to create a verbal sigil based on the servitor’s purpose. “Help\nme bring in more money” could give us the following options:\n\nBrimple Yongh\n\nGin Hopelbrym\n\nLimb Boy Phren (Which would also be a good name for a pop-punk garage band.)\n\n## Lifespan\n\nLength of existence is definitely something to consider when mapping out a\nservitor. If it’s only going to have a single one-shot responsibility, and you\nwon’t need it after that task is complete, then it really doesn’t need to\nexist much longer than that. However, if you need it to consistently or\nrepeatedly do a job, you’ll want to make sure it lasts indefinitely. In which\ncase, take some time to think about what will fuel it and keep it going.\n\nYou may also want to introduce a killswitch—that is, a particular action that\nwill immediately end the servitor’s existence, like saying its name backward.\nThis really isn’t a safety precaution so much as it is (for lack of a better\nway of saying it) euthanasia. Once all its jobs are complete, you don’t want\nit just floating sadly around without a purpose. Have some mercy and put the\nlittle guy down.\n\nSomething else to think about is where your servitor will live. If there will\nbe periods of inactivity between the times you call on it, a home base is not\na bad idea: a statue, or a piece of jewelry, or even a part of your body.\n\n## Activation\n\nOnce you’ve got every aspect of your servitor in mind, write it all down, then\nread this list of attributes out loud. You can use the following as a\ntemplate:\n\nYour name is [name of servitor], and you exist to [state purpose here].\n\nYou are charged with the following abilities.\n\n[List off everything you want your servitor to be able to do, including how it\nwill move around (levitation, flight, teleportation, etc.),\n\nwhether it can learn by doing, and whether it can change its own shape, size,\nappearance, and visibility as needed to accomplish its goals.]\n\nYou gain strength from my awareness of you,\n\nand from my appreciation of your efforts.\n\nYou will always come to me when I call your name,\n\nor whenever I need you.\n\nYour abilities will increase every time you\n\nsuccessfully complete a task for me.\n\nYou will live [indefinitely, or until a particular date].\n\nIf I, and only I, [insert your killswitch here],\n\nyou will immediately dissipate, and your energy will return to me.\n\nYou are born on [date and time of the working],\n\nwhen your sigil is charged and fired.\n\nCharge and fire the sigil, and that’s it! You’ve officially birthed a\nservitor. Congratulations on the latest addition to your family.\n\n## The Five-Fingered Hand of Eris\n\nI have one final symbol that I want to discuss: the Five-Fingered Hand of\nEris. Mentioned in the Pure Chaos spell in chapter 6, the Five-Fingered Hand\nof Eris, from an aesthetic standpoint, has always been one of my favorite\noccult symbols.\n\nThe Hand first appeared on page 00021 of the Principia, accompanied by the\nfollowing text:\n\nThe official symbol of POEE [Paratheo-Anametamystikhood Of Eris Esoteric] is\nhere illustrated. It may be this, or any similar device to represent TWO\nOPPOSING ARROWS CONVERGING INTO A COMMON POINT. It may be vertical,\nhorizontal, or else such, and it may be elaborated or simplified as desired.\n\nNOTE: In the lore of western magic, the [crescent moon] is taken to symbolize\nhorns, especially the horns of Satan or of diabolical beasties. The Five\nFingered Hand of Eris, however, is not intended to be taken as satanic, for\nthe “horns” are supported by another set of inverted “horns”. Or maybe it is\nwalrus tusks. I don’t know what it is, to tell the truth.⁴⁴\n\n![](../Images/image-1STSIR1I.png)\n\nThe Five-Fingered Hand of Eris\n\nThe Principia doesn’t ascribe any further meaning to the Hand, although for\nsome Discordians, it’s come to represent the forces of Creation and\nDestruction crashing into each other. There was a (surprisingly successful)\npush to get it recognized as the official astronomical symbol of the dwarf\nplanet Eris, but other than that, it just kind of means “Discordian.” As a\nsigil, though, I feel like it also has some magical uses.\n\n![](../Images/image-GGQEU6R1.png)\n\nAstronomical Symbol for the Dwarf Planet Eris\n\nAre you familiar with the Hand of Glory? Back in the olden days, it was a\ncandle made out of the severed left hand and the rendered fat of a hanged\nconvict. When lit, the Hand of Glory was believed to paralyze anyone in its\nvicinity, and it could also open any locked door.⁴⁵ You can see a Hand of\nGlory in action in the original Wicker Man (1973).\n\nMy theory is that if a Hand of Glory caused bodies at rest to remain\nmotionless, the Five-Fingered Hand of Eris could be used to set things in\nmotion.\n\nIf I wanted to engineer a series of events that would culminate in a specific\ngoal, I would cast the Pure Chaos spell on page 89, grabbing a seven-day\ncandle, drawing a Hand of Eris down the front of it , anointing it with oil,\nand, if I was feeling saucy, dressing it with the herb five-finger grass (to\nactivate the handiness, and also because the name is on the nose), along with\nany other herbs and oils relevant to the work. And then I could go ahead with\nthe spell as described.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## Moon Water\n\nAs popular as it is to make moon water by leaving a jar of water on a\nwindowsill during the full moon, I have to admit that I’m not a fan.\nTechnically, all water is already moon water: The gravitational pull of the\nmoon controls the tides, and since our bodies are around 60 percent water, the\nmoon can have a profound effect on our mood, mental health, and temperament.\nWe don’t have to make the water more moonish to use it in magic.\n\nThe keyword here, of course, is use. If we’re going to take the time to make\nsomething, we should do stuff with it. And there’s another form of lunar water\nthat has several practical uses, both magical and mundane.\n\nThe willow tree has long been associated with water and the moon. It’s a\nquick-rooting plant that thrives along the banks of bodies of water.\nAdditionally, willow is rich in a chemical called salicin, a natural anti-\ninflammatory and fever reducer that has been used in medicine for thousands of\nyears. If you want to make a moon-oriented libation, willow water is an\nexcellent way to go.\n\nWillow water can be sipped as a headache remedy (although it’s got a bitter\ntaste, so best not to chug—at least maybe add some honey), or it can be used\nin a relaxing and/or ritual bath. Or, it can be poured as an offering to the\nmoon—a lot of gardeners swear that soaking a new plant’s roots in willow water\nbefore potting will help it flourish, so we can symbolically capitalize on\nthis by pouring our willow water at the base of a tree (oaks are sacred to\nDiana, so that would be a good choice), or using it to nourish anything we\nplant on the full moon, either physically or metaphysically.\n\nMaking willow water from scratch is not too much of an onus, provided you’ve\ngot willow trees nearby, or you have access to willow twigs. However, in a\npinch, you can make bootleg willow water with a humble Bayer aspirin, which is\nhonestly the more Chaos Witchcraft approach.\n\nThe active ingredient in aspirin is salicylic acid, which is a synthetic\nderivative of the salicin found in willow. Dissolve an aspirin in a cup of\nwater, and you have kit-bashed willow water. The salicylic acid is just as\nbeneficial to root systems as willow water is, so you can still pour it as an\noffering. Plus, from a symbolic perspective, what is a round, white, willowy\npill if not a tiny moon?\n\n## You will need\n\nThe full moon\n\nA needle or toothpick\n\nAn aspirin\n\nA bottle of water\n\n## Directions\n\nOn the night of the full moon, create a sigil for the desire of your choice.\nAstrologically, the moon stays full for three days—that is, if the full moon\nfalls on a Saturday, you can still do full moon work on Friday or Sunday—so\nthat gives you some extra breathing room to pull this off.\n\nOnce your sigil is ready, use your needle or toothpick to carve your sigil\nonto the aspirin. It doesn’t need to be perfect or cut deeply into the\npill—just an impression of it will do. Use the method described on page 98 to\ncharge the sigil. After that, drop the inscribed aspirin into the bottle of\nwater, cap it, and give it a good shake, thus firing the sigil. Set the bottle\naside but check on it every thirty-five minutes or so, shaking it each time\nuntil the pill is fully dissolved.\n\nHow you employ your sigilized willow water depends on the spell you’re\ncasting. If the sigil you created is for protective Aftermath Magic, for\ninstance, pour the water along the boundary of your home; if the sigil is to\nimprove your dating options, add the water to a tea brewed with love-oriented\nherbs like lavender and vanilla and sip it while watching your favorite\nromantic comedy.\n\nIt may take some patience and a little exertion, but the satisfaction that\ncomes from being able to say “I legitimately made this” is worth it. And\nreally, as a Chaos Witch, you can’t be afraid of putting that extra effort\ninto your craft. Don’t be afraid of getting your hands wet.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 8\n\n\n## Daemons,\n\n## Demons,\n\n## and Pop Culture Chaos\n\nDespite being crafted as a parody religion, many Discordians—including its\nfounders—came to accept the bona fide existence of Eris. As Mal-2 stated when\nMargot Adler interviewed him for Drawing Down the Moon, “If you do this type\nof thing well enough, it starts to work.” He also added that Lord Omar once\nconfided, “If I had realized that all of this was going to come true, I would\nhave chosen Venus.”⁴⁶\n\nMal-2 himself did not originally believe in Eris—he just found it hysterical\nthat the Greeks had a goddess of discord and thought it would be funny if\nthere was a religion devoted to her. But over time, his perception of the\ndeity changed. “Eris is an authentic goddess,” he told Adler. “Furthermore,\nshe is an old one.”⁴⁷ While Mal-2 never identified as a Chaos Magician, his\nexperience with Eris is a prime example of how Chaos Magic tends to operate:\nHis practice developed first, and his beliefs evolved to accommodate them.\n\nAs a Chaos Witch, you are free to believe in whatever—or whomever—you’d like.\nBut aside from the standard gods and goddesses who appear in world\nmythologies, there are a myriad of other entities floating around out there\nwho are worthy of veneration. Some may have more fictional origins than\nothers, but all of them are as real as you allow them to be.\n\n## Principles Personified\n\nAlthough generally referred to as a goddess, Eris was perceived as a daemon in\nancient Greek religion and philosophy: That is, she was understood to be a\npersonification of an abstract concept. Roughly one hundred fifty different\npersonifications appear in Greek mythology and literature, representing a\nvariety of notions, such as Love, Grief, Age, Hunger, Modesty, Persuasion,\nFame, Rivalry, Peace, and Injustice.\n\nFor the most part, personifications were not worshiped or venerated in the\nsame way the Olympians and related gods were. But there is nothing saying that\nyou can’t invoke one or more of them to bolster the magical work you’re doing.\n\nIn addition to Eris, here are some other personifications you might consider\ncalling upon as a Chaos Witch, each of which can be tied to a particular Chaos\nprinciple, form of magic, or Discordian Element. If you ever hit a mental\nblock with one of these concepts, reach out to the corresponding\npersonification and see if they can shed some light for you.\n\nAkratos—Personification of Unmixed Wine. He is associated with Sweet.\n\nDolos—Personification of Guile and Craftiness. He is associated with Diverse\nApproaches.\n\nDysnomia—Personification of Lawlessness. She is associated with Avoidance of\nDogma.\n\nEpidotes—Personification of Ritual Purification. She is associated with\nDeconditioning.\n\nEutychia—Personification of Good Luck. She is associated with Orange.\n\nHomonoia (not to be confused with Harmonia/Aneris)—Personification of\nUnanimity and Oneness of Mind. She is associated with Partnership.\n\nHygeia—Personification of Good Health. She is associated with Prickle.\n\nHypnos—Personification of Sleep and the Father of Dreams. He is associated\nwith Gnosis.\n\nIakkhos—Personification of the Ritual Shout. He is associated with Boom.\n\nKairos—Personification of Opportunity. He is associated with Thinking.\n\nLethe—Personification of Forgetfulness; also the name of the underworld river\nfrom which spirits of the recently deceased drink to forget their previous\nincarnations. She is associated with Immersion.\n\nNike—Personification of Victory. She is associated with Ego.\n\nPheme (sometimes called Ossa)—Personification of Rumor, Reputation, and\nScandal. She is associated with Pungent.\n\nPloutos—Personification of Agricultural Bounty. He is associated with Wealth.\n\nPolemos—Personification of Battle. He is associated with War.\n\nPothos—Personification of Sexual Desire. He is associated with Sex.\n\nSophia—Personification of Wisdom. She is associated with Personal Experience.\n\nSophrosyne—Personification of Self-Control. She is associated with Discipline.\n\nTekhne—Personification of Technical Skill. She is associated with Technical\nExcellence.\n\nThanatos—Personification of Nonviolent Death. He is associated with Death.\n\nAnd of course, if there’s not already a cohesive personification of the\ncondition, emotion, or quality you want to evoke, you can do what Hesiod\n(allegedly) did and simply make one up. Or else you can revamp your beliefs\nand start worshiping fictional characters.\n\n## Discordian Demonolatry\n\nThere’s a line in the Old Testament that reads, “For all the gods of the\nGentiles are demons,” from which stems the idea that the gods of one religion\nare the demons of the next.⁴⁸ That is certainly one way to approach the\nconcept of demons, although contemporary demonolater Ramsey Dukes offers an\nalternative view: As he sees it, demons are the personifications of the\ntrials, frustrations, and microaggressions of daily life.⁴⁹\n\nBoth perceptions are valid, and my own thoughts on demons ping-pong between\nthe two. But for the purposes of Chaos Witchcraft, I want you to consider\nDukes’s take—if the Greek personifications offer illumination, demons can\noffer pathways around the obstacles they represent.\n\nAt some point in the 1980s, Lord Omar reached out to Discordian artist and\nmusician Roldo Odlor and presented the rough outline of a book containing\ninformation on the demonic inhabitants of Thud. (Thud being Lord Omar’s name\nfor the real world, which is intriguing, considering that Zarathud is the\nApostle of Bureaucracy, the season most related to earthly matters.) Roldo\nsketched some designs for the demons and sent them back to Lord Omar, and\nalthough the two lost touch, Roldo hung on to the originals, which were,\nalmost two decades later, published alongside Lord Omar’s descriptions as the\nGoetia Discordia.\n\nThe Goetia does not offer much in the way of ritual instruction, but based on\ntheir portrayals, the demons themselves are very much personifications in\ntheir own right. Relations with them would come in handy whenever you find\nyourself having to navigate the more Aneristic aspects of our society.\n\nThere are nine demons described in the Goetia. Here are eight of them:\n\nBabbity—Demon of Unoriginality.\n\nEvangelicus—Demon of Dogma.\n\nFilibuster—Demon of Gossip.\n\nFlagstone—Demon of Mindlessness and Obedience.\n\nGrimpil—Demon of Diversity Prevention.\n\nStarbuck—Demon of Superstitions.\n\nTechnocrust—Demon of Redundancy.\n\nUncle Albert—Demon of Dress Codes and Consumerism.⁵⁰\n\nThe ninth demon of the Goetia is Azazel. He stands out a bit since he’s the\nonly one to make significant appearances in religions outside of\nDiscordianism. As such, he deserves some special attention.\n\n## Azazel\n\nIn Judaism, Azazel is the goat who carries collective sins out of the\ncommunity; in apocryphal Christianity and ceremonial magic, he’s a fallen\nangel who taught humankind the arts of cosmetics, metalworking, and\nWitchcraft; and in Islam, he’s one of three angels who were picked to go to\nEarth and live among mortals, although he changed his mind at the last minute\nand went back to heaven.⁵¹ But in Discordianism, Azazel guards the exit out of\nThud.\n\nThe Goetia describes Azazel as having a masculine human body and the face of a\nprophet, with a serpent in place of his left arm.⁵² It also states that he\ncannot be summoned, only encountered unexpectedly, and that he holds the Apple\nof Discord in his right hand. To get past him, the apple must be filled out in\ntriplicate.\n\n![](../Images/image-FE2JSXHH.png)\n\nHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa’s Seal of Saturn,\n\nWhich, Over Time, Has Become Known as the Sigil of Azazel\n\nLord Omar did not explain why he chose this particular imagery, but it’s not\ntoo hard to unlock a deeper meaning. When you are presented with an\nopportunity to engage in Creative Disorder, you are interacting with Azazel.\nAnd the more Creative Disorder you incite or inspire, the more filled out his\napple becomes. Eventually, he will step aside and allow you to pass, at which\ntime you’ll see beyond the grids of Order and Disorder, getting a glimpse of\nreality itself.\n\nWhich is a lot to process, but definitely worth imagining.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## A Superstitious Lot\n\nMy mother was as pragmatic as they come, and she did not indulge in\nirrationality of any kind … except when it came to pennies. “Find a penny,\npick it up,” she’d exclaim whenever she happened to spot a random copper coin\non the ground. “And all the day, you’ll have good luck!”\n\nAnd this is where her repressed superstitious upbringing kicked into high\ngear, because the maxim only applied to pennies that were faceup. Tails-up\npennies were bad luck and had to stay where they were, or else. They could,\nhowever, be turned over, so that whoever came across them next could benefit\nfrom auspiciousness.\n\nFrom this, I learned that every superstition has a remedy, and every one of\nthose remedies is a potential apotropaic Aftermath spell.\n\nIf you accidentally walk under a ladder, all you have to do is walk under it\nagain, but backward this time; if you break a mirror, just wait seven hours to\ncollect the pieces, and you won’t have to deal with those pesky seven years of\nbad luck; spilling salt is ominous, but throwing a pinch of it over your\nshoulder averts any sodium-related disasters.\n\nUpon learning that a given practice is closed and/or initiatory, a common\ncomplaint from younger Witches of European descent is, “Well, then what am I\nsupposed to do? My culture doesn’t have any magic.” But it does! There is\ncultural magic all around us in local superstitions and folk beliefs. The more\nof them you collect in your area, the more unique regional magic will be\naccessible to you. Ask Starbuck, the demon of superstition, to guide you on\nyour quest.\n\nGranted, I live in Texas, so the majority of our superstitions revolve around\nour sports franchises. Plus our minor league hockey team—the only team I\nreally cared about—relocated to Des Moines in 2013. But I flip at least five\npennies a week, so I’ve still got a rich well of cultural magic from which to\ndraw.\n\n## The Original Snake Oil Salesman\n\nBe they daemonic or demonic, personifications are fairly easy to get one’s\nbrain around, but you may find yourself pushing back when confronted with a\nmore nebulous concept—something like pop culture deities. And this is\ncompletely understandable. Rest assured, though, that pop culture deities have\nhistorical precedence with modern-day application.\n\nMy dear Chaos Witch, it is with great pleasure that I introduce Glycon, the\nGreco-Roman god of snakes. Who was also a sock puppet.\n\nIn the second century of the Common Era, a professional mystic—which is what\nthey had in ancient Greece in place of social media influencers—named\nAlexander announced the pending arrival of a new incarnation of Asclepius, the\ngod of healing and medicine. On the scheduled date of the incarnation’s\narrival, Alexander gathered a crowd in the marketplace of his hometown\nAbonoteichos, and as the sun reached its noonday peak, he pulled out a large\ngoose egg and broke it open, revealing a snake.⁵³\n\nA week later, the serpent, dubbed Glycon, had grown to roughly five feet in\nlength and had somehow developed a human head, complete with flowing blonde\nhair. Glycon could speak and issue prophecies to his devotees, and word spread\nthat he had the ability to cure infertility.\n\nThe cult of Glycon got very popular very quickly, flowing out of Greece and\ninto Rome, although the Roman satirist Lucian was deeply peeved by the whole\nthing, pointing out that while Glycon’s body did seem to be that of a large,\ntame constrictor, his head was just a big puppet animated by Alexander. Lucian\nalso claimed that Glycon’s famed powers of fertility had less to do with\nanything miraculous, and more to do with Alexander’s boundary issues.\n\nAlexander himself shuffled off the mortal coil in 170 CE, and without its\nfearless leader, the cult of Glycon faded away after a century or so. However,\nGlycon himself was not forgotten. In fact, he’s still venerated today.\n\nIn a 2003 interview with the magazine Arthur, comic book author and Ceremonial\nMagician Alan Moore spoke of his personal devotion to Glycon, stating, “If I’m\ngonna have a god I prefer it to be a complete hoax and a glove puppet because\nI’m not likely to start believing that glove puppet created the universe or\nanything like that.”⁵⁴\n\nMoore went on to explain that to him, the idea of the god was the god, adding,\n“[M]agicians would say there was a ‘serpent current,’ if you like, an energy,\nthat people could connect up to. And they might understand this energy in a\nnumber of different forms—as Asclepius, or Glycon or Kundalini or whatever—but\nit’s essentially a kind of sinuous kind of energy that we associate with the\nsnake and a certain sort of consciousness.” In other words, Glycon represents\nthe embodiment of a serpentine egregore. And while Glycon himself may have\njust been a pet snake with his head stuck in an oversized mask, his likeness\ncan be utilized to tap into a greater archetype.\n\nTo sum up, Glycon was (and is) a pop culture deity. And if he can still be\nvenerated today, so too can any number of egregores and personifications, all\npatiently waiting for you to decide they exist.\n\n## Putting the Cult in Popular Culture\n\nA standard reaction to the thought of pop culture occultism is, “Well,\nsomebody’s been dabbling in one too many role-playing games … ” But the\nmetaphysical has always drawn inspiration from fiction, and there is a lot of\npower to be found in that.\n\nIn Condensed Chaos, Phil Hine offers the following point of view:\n\n“One aspect of Chaos Magick that seems to upset some people is the Chaos\nMagician’s (or Chaoist, if you like) occasional fondness for working with\nimages culled from non-historical sources, such as invoking H. P Lovecraft’s\nCthulhu Mythos beings, mapping the Rocky Horror Show onto the Tree of Life,\nslamming through the astral void in an X-Wing fighter, and ‘channeling’\ncommunications from gods that didn’t exist five minutes ago.”⁵⁵\n\nHine also talks about getting “interesting results” from rituals based on C.\nS. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia, a series of novels based on Christian\ntheology. In Greater Pagandom, the venerable Church of All Worlds was inspired\nby the science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land; back in the 1990s,\nKlingon Wicca was an actual thing; and in 2015, the Temple of the Jedi Order\nwas granted IRS tax exemption as a religious organization. My own beliefs were\nprofoundly influenced by the novel Kraken and the stage play A Perfect Ganesh,\nbut they were also deeply affected by Skinny Legs and All by Tom Robbins and\nThe King Must Die by Mary Renault.\n\nEven the myths that we treasure are just stories that some ancient person\nconceived and/or wrote down at some point. They’re amazing and useful and\neducational to be sure … but they’re just stories. No matter how heavily we\nrely on them.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they’re not true. Nor does it mean that the characters\nwho appear in those stories can’t be brought into the real world (whatever\nthat is).\n\nFrom an esoteric standpoint, fictional characters can evolve into\negregores—spirit-like entities residing in Kia and manifesting in Aether, who\ncome into existence through collective belief. When a comic superhero or the\nprotagonist of a book series gains traction with readers and starts growing in\npopularity, their personality traits and attributes become canon, and that\ncharacter can take on an independent life of its own.\n\nNot to get overly meta here, but American Gods by Neil Gaiman provides\nexcellent examples of egregores in action. Within the novel, the gods and\nspirits of the Old World are brought to the New World as people migrate from\nthe former to the latter. But over time, people stop believing as much in\ntheir gods, and so those gods have to get jobs. Meanwhile, new gods start\nspawning as secular faith shifts away from religion and toward\nindustrialization: gods like Technology, Media, and Conspiracy Theory. These\nnew gods are egregores—they came into existence once enough people believed in\nthem.\n\nAnd here’s an even better example. After winning an academy award for her\nportrayal of Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, Jodie Foster\nfamously turned down the opportunity to reprise the role in Hannibal.\nOfficially, Foster cited scheduling conflicts, but she also claimed that she\ndidn’t want to “trample” Starling, indicating that she wasn’t comfortable with\nhow the character was depicted in the sequel.⁵⁶ The author Thomas Harris may\nhave invented the character Clarice Starling for a novel, but Foster knew\nStarling; she’d spent a big chunk of time as Starling; and she had a deep\nunderstanding of how Starling would have reacted true to form when dropped\ninto the events of Hannibal.\n\nWhether consciously or not, Foster channeled Starling as an egregore. So take\nsome time to think about the egregores you know well, and how they can be of\nassistance to you. And if one seems to provide more consistent prompt succor\nthan any other—say, Scrooge McDuck consistently comes through and helps you\nsave money—there is nothing preventing you from doing what Mal-2 and Lord Omar\ndid and starting your own religion.\n\nLet’s figure out how to do that.\n\n## The All-Seeing Eye of the Storm\n\nSince I’ve already fanboyed extensively over the Scarlet Witch, I’m going to\nturn to another Marvel heroine around which to build a devotion: Ororo Munroe,\nbetter known as Storm of the X-Men.\n\nWhen she was first introduced to readers back in 1975, Storm believed herself\nto be a goddess. In fact, her arrival is heralded by a group of villagers\nsummoning her through song, “Ororo, great goddess of the storm, come unto us\nand ease our burden.”⁵⁷\n\nRight away, we’ve got an invocation, which clearly works, because Ororo\nanswers the call. The villagers offer to sacrifice ten goats and chickens to\nher if Ororo will bring rain to end the drought, to which she replies, “Save\nyour beasts, my children. You need them more than I. I will do as you plead.”\nSo we also know that physical offerings are not necessary when venerating\nOroro, although praise does seem to be an effective oblation.\n\nOroro eventually assumed leadership of the X-Men, and she took command of the\nunderground community of mutants known as the Morlocks after a fight to the\n(almost) death with their previous ruler. While she abhors the taking of life,\nshe is not afraid to kill in the line of duty, so in addition to being a storm\ngoddess, we can also see her as a goddess of war, strategy, and\nsovereignty—especially after she married T’Challa, the Black Panther, and\nbecame queen of Wakanda. And speaking of, Ororo has had several long-term\nromantic relationships, both with men and at least one woman, so we can\nperceive her as a goddess of love as well. Plus, she’s an accomplished thief,\nmaking her the patroness of those who operate outside the law.\n\nYou know, Ororo is starting to sound a lot like Astarte, Ishtar, and Inanna.\nIn fact, the period in the comics when Ororo’s powers were taken away from her\ncould be read as a modern retelling of the Descent of Inanna. But here’s the\nbest part: For much of her tenure with the X-Men, Ororo wore a distinctive\ntiara, the design of which has become an unmistakable emblem. What this means\nfor us is that Ororo comes with her very own sigil, which you can make use of\nwhen venerating her.\n\nBecause of her equation with Inanna, Ororo is associated with the planet\nVenus, which means Friday would be the appropriate day of the week to pray to\nher. And when she first joined the X-Men, she turned down a bedroom in the\nX-Mansion, preferring instead to move into an attic, which she filled with\nflowering plants. As such, her altars should always have live flowers on them.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## Cutting Cords\n\nWhether we want them to or not, relationships sometimes come to an end. This\ncan be true of interpersonal connections in the real world as well as a\npartnership fostered with a particular deity. In either case, a time may come\nto cut ties and move on.\n\nThe pictures and videos of cord-cutting spells I’ve seen online usually\ninvolve two taper candles set a few inches apart and connected by a piece of\nstring. The idea is that as the candles burn down, the string will eventually\nalight and burn away, and the spell will be complete. It’s a workable setup,\nbut honestly, I have a couple of concerns with it.\n\nFirst off, it’s the fire hazard to end all fire hazards, and second, it’s\nunpredictable. The string might catch fire, or it might get stuck in the wax,\nor it might just droop and slide down as the candles melt. But if you’re\ndetermined to use this method, awkward calls to your insurance adjuster be\ndamned, the following spell is less incendiary.\n\n## You will need\n\nTwo matching taper candles (white or the color you associate with Bureaucracy)\n\nA knife\n\nString or twine, at least ten inches in length\n\nTwo candleholders\n\nA pair of scissors\n\n## Directions\n\nStarting at the base and working toward the wick, use the knife to carve your\nname vertically into one of the candles. Carve the other person’s name\nvertically into the second candle, but this time start at the wick and move\ntoward the base. Take a length of string, tie one end around the middle of\nyour candle, and the other end around the middle of the other person’s candle.\nSet the candles in the holders a few inches apart.\n\nLight the other person’s candle first and let it burn for five minutes. Do not\nleave it unattended. Then light your candle. After doing so, grab your\nscissors and recite the following:\n\nFate has bound [name of other person] to me, but I take Fate into my hands. By\nthe powers of the Morai, personifications of Fate, I cut the cord that\nconnects us.\n\nSnip through the string and let the candles burn down.\n\nDon’t let chance determine whether or not the cord is cut. Make the conscious\ndecision to cut it yourself.\n\nAll this said, the first rule of casting a cord-cutting spell is, don’t tell\neveryone on social media that you’re casting a cord-cutting spell. Seriously.\nIf you’re truly trying to make a clean break from someone, talking about them\nand posting pictures of the work you’re doing just reinforces that connection\ninstead of severing it. Keeping the work to yourself until after it’s\naccomplished will get you much better results than dragging your friends and\nfollowers along with you.\n\nAnd while we’re on the subject of social media: If you’re casting a cord-\ncutting spell, but you’re still connected to the other person on various\nplatforms, you’re not truly cutting anything. Block them. Or unfollow them, or\nunfriend them, or all of the above. Making a show of cutting magical ties\nwhile leaving digital ties in place is disingenuous. If you’re going to cut\ncords, cut all of them.\n\nAs discussed in chapter 5, your spells will produce the best effects when you\ncan cast them without worrying about them—when your determination is stronger\nthan your emotional investment. Following this logic, cord-\n\ncutting spells will only work when you are fully ready to let go of a given\nperson, place, or thing, and you are able to walk away with the knowledge that\nyou are finally free.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 9\n\n\n## Ethical\n\n## Chaos and the\n\n## Curse of Greyface\n\nAs a Chaos Witch, your personal ethics will ultimately derive from whichever\nbelief system you happen to be exploring: If your current beliefs revolve\naround nontheistic Satanism, you’ll probably be living by the Seven\nFundamental Tenets; if your beliefs involve Heathenism, you’ll want to uphold\nthe Aesirian Code of Nine. But the broader concepts of right and wrong vary\nfrom paradigm to paradigm. The Chaos trick is to not let yourself be wedded to\nor bogged down by any of them, while still putting them to use in your\nWitchcraft.\n\nThe phrase nothing is true, everything is permitted is bandied about quite a\nbit in Chaos-oriented spaces. And while it’s a pretty clear statement on\npaper, the deeper meaning is sometimes debated, mainly because people outside\nof the Chaos current (and sometimes people within it) take it to mean that any\nbelief or practice is up for grabs as a tool, regardless of where it may or\nmay not have originated, or which culture it ultimately belongs to. In other\nwords, “Chaos Witchcraft means that I can do whatever I want, without\nconsequence.” But we have to remember that every action will always have some\nkind of reaction.\n\nI am legally allowed to consume alcohol, but I’m also a recovering alcoholic,\nand I know what happens when I put alcohol in my body, so I choose not to do\nthat. And yes, nothing may be true, and everything may be permitted, but we\nalso need to keep in mind what we learned from Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park\n(1993)—playing a mathematician who specializes in Chaos Theory, coincidentally\nenough: Just because we can doesn’t mean we should.\n\n## Army of Popes\n\nIn Discordianism, everyone is a Pope. Literally everyone. If you’re reading\nthis, you are a Pope; if someone is reading this over your shoulder, they’re a\nPope too. As it says in the Principia, “A Pope is someone who is not under the\nauthority of the authorities,” which means that as a Discordian, you have\ncomplete power over your actions, beliefs, and morality.⁵⁸ No one can tell you\nwhat to do or think except you.\n\nOne of the fringe benefits of being a Pope is that you get to carry a cunning\nPope Card, the original of which can be found within the Principia Discordia.\nTraditionally, Discordians would photocopy that page and cut out the card to\nkeep in their wallets, but today, you can find the template online and print\nout your own. (You can also write to me, and I will send you one for free.)\n\nPapal infallibility aside, the only behavioral rules to which Discordians are\nencouraged to adhere are those set out in the Five Commandments provided by\nthe Apostle Zarathud, which are collectively known as the Pentabarf. The\nkicker is that the commandments can’t really be followed, since they tend to\ncontradict themselves and cancel each other out.\n\n![](../Images/image-N4OA0G4W.png)\n\nDiscordian Pope Card\n\nHere is the Pentabarf as it is presented in the Principia:\n\nI—There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is Your Goddess. There is no Erisian\nMovement but The Erisian Movement and it is The Erisian Movement. And every\nGolden Apple Corps is the beloved home of a Golden Worm.\n\nII—A Discordian Shall Always use the Official Discordian Document Numbering\nSystem.\n\nIII—A Discordian is Required during his early Illumination to Go Off Alone &\nPartake Joyously of a Hot Dog on a Friday; this Devotive Ceremony to\nRemonstrate against the popular Paganisms of the Day: of Catholic Christendom\n(no meat on Friday), of Judaism (no meat of Pork), of Hindic Peoples (no meat\nof Beef), of Buddhists (no meat of animal), and of Discordians (no Hot Dog\nBuns).\n\nIV—A Discordian shall Partake of No Hot Dog Buns, for Such was the Solace of\nOur Goddess when She was Confronted with The Original Snub.\n\nV—A Discordian is Prohibited of Believing what he reads.⁵⁹\n\nOn the surface, the Pentabarf is a satirical send-up of the tenets of\norganized religion and not to be taken seriously. The Official Discordian\nNumbering System, for example, found on page 00020 of the Principia, is\nintentionally confounding to the point of uselessness. But it’s the Fifth\nCommandment—the one that invalidates the other four—where a heavier meaning\ncomes to light. As a Pope, you may not have to do what anyone else says, but\nyou are also charged to think critically, and to not accept anything without\nquestion.\n\n## Equal and Opposite Reactions\n\nThe downside to an all-Pope religion is that unfortunately, we can’t hold\nanyone accountable for our actions except ourselves, which also means that we\nhave to accept the consequences of our actions. I may fully believe that\nmonetary wealth should be equally distributed among all people, but if I\ndecide to make that happen by robbing a bank, I am going to jail. Explaining\nto the judge that Eris told me to do it will not get my charges dismissed.\n\nMind you, “consequence” does not automatically mean getting in trouble: If I\ncast a Discord spell to get a coworker fired, and they get fired, no one from\nHR is going to toss my office for miscreant sigils. Nor is a consequence\nnecessarily a bad thing. If I cast a Bureaucracy spell to help a friend get\nover a head cold, and my friend gets better, their recovery is at least\npartially a consequence of my action. But as Witches, especially Chaos\nWitches, we do need to own both the positive and the negative results of our\nmagic.\n\nOne of Stephen King’s greatest short stories, entitled “Everything’s\nEventual,” centers on a young man named Dinky, who has the power to control\nother people through sigils. King never refers to them as sigils—his\nprotagonist can just draw shapes no one has ever seen before and can customize\nthem by adding words and names—but they’re totally sigils. Regardless, Dinky’s\nabilities land him on the radar of a clandestine organization that recruits\nhim as a long-range assassin.\n\nFor a long while, he’s content with his life. He likes using his power, and he\ndoesn’t mind killing. However, when he learns that his targets are progressive\npolitical activists and critical thinkers with growing audiences, he makes\nplans to escape the organization. Assassination only becomes an ethical issue\nfor him when he realizes that his targets are people he believes are trying to\ndo some good in the world.\n\nWhen we talk about beliefs, you might think of religion, gods, spirits, and\nmagic, and those certainly all involve belief. But belief as an artifact is a\nlot wider and more nuanced than just religion and spirituality. And if we\nrestrict our understanding of belief to just those things, we’re really\nputting some limits on how capable we can be as Chaos Witches.\n\nWhatever your ethics happen to be, they will come into play as you assemble\nthe various bits and bobs of your personal Chaos practice. It’s common to hear\npeople say “I take from everything” when describing Eclectic Witchcraft, but\n“taking” implies a change in ownership—what once belonged to one person or\ngroup now belongs to someone else. And contrary to the opinions you may\nencounter on social media, when it comes to Witchcraft, not everything belongs\nto everyone.\n\nSo, before you do anything else with Chaos Witchcraft, it’s imperative that\nyou examine the beliefs you already hold, determine where they came from and\nwhy they are important to you, and set aside the ones that are holding you\nback. Starting with open and closed practices.\n\n## Aneristically Open, Eristically Closed\n\nThe botanist Frederic Clements first espoused the idea that ecological\nsystems, unmolested, will eventually reach a steady state of self-sufficiency,\nand his theories made the jump from ecology to sociology in the identification\nof what are now called closed communities. Closed communities can be ethnic,\nregional, or religious in nature (or combo platters of all three), but all of\nthem limit their interactions with outsiders, and members of closed\ncommunities are either born into them or accepted into them on an individual\nbasis.\n\nExamples of closed communities include the Amish, the Roma, Haitian Vodou, and\nJudaism. Within Paganism, initiatory Traditions are closed communities. And I\ndon’t know exactly when the one word managed to replace the other, but it’s\nreally important that we stress community over practice, because if we only\nfocus on cherry-picked parts of closed systems, we leave way too much room for\nreinforced marginalization.\n\nWhen determining whether a given practice is open or closed, start at the tip\nof a pyramid and work your way down: Cartomancy? Open. Ritual cartomancy?\nOpen. Ritual cartomancy in the Romani tradition? Closed. It’s only when a\nspecific practice is nestled within the context of a given community that the\ndoor swings shut, not before.\n\nAnd while working on determining what is open and closed, pay special\nattention to what members of those communities have to say on the matter,\nbecause a big part of the issue with the nonmarginalized understanding of\nclosed practices has to do with how we’re defining practice. On multiple\noccasions, I’ve heard someone say, “Peyote is a closed practice,” or, “Chakras\nare a closed practice,” or, “Tarot is a closed practice.” But peyote is a\nplant; the ritual use of peyote within an Indigenous religious ceremony is a\npractice.\n\nAnother example: chakras are energy points that correspond to collections of\nnerve bundles in the human body. An exercise designed to open a particular\nchakra in a Buddhist or Hindu context is a practice, but the chakras\nthemselves just conceptually exist, regardless of whether or not we\nacknowledge or poke at them.\n\nThe tarot is a deck of playing cards that originated in Italy and was\neventually repurposed as a method of divination in\n\neighteenth-century France. The unique set of techniques for reading tarot\npassed down within Romani culture is a practice.\n\nIt’s a linguistic issue more than anything else, but it’s a symptom of a\nlarger problem. Many of us in the global minority don’t have firsthand lived\nexperience within a closed culture, so we’re not always able to accurately\nidentify what artifacts are or are not readily available to us. Terms like\nopen practice and closed practice can be helpful, but because we’ve allowed\ndominant groups to have the final say on what is open or closed, with little\nor no input from marginalized groups, those labels have become arbitrary and\nare in danger of becoming meaningless.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## Baneful Magic\n\nWithin the occult, the word baneful was originally used in reference to\ndangerous plants. Like, poisonous herbs that were hazardous to work with:\nThose were baneful.⁶⁰ It’s really only been since the early 2020s that baneful\nhas been applied to broader magical practice. And in the grand scheme of\nthings, that’s okay—there have always been and always will be influxes of new\nideas into European-based witchcraft: Baneful magic, trickster spirits,\nreturn-to-sender spells, cord-cutting spells, lemon hexes, and moon water are\nall examples of either brand-new ideas or less-new ideas that have been\nreworked and repurposed. This does not mean that they are not useful, or that\nthey are not valid.\n\nThat said, Witches started saying baneful magic to avoid the bias and negative\nconnotations inherent in the phrase black magic. However, racial bias is very\nmuch still present in baneful magic—we’ve just given it a new name.\n\nWay back in the age of the fifteenth-century grimoire traditions, there was no\ndistinction between black magic and white magic. Instead, there was a\ndistinction between black magic and natural magic.⁶¹ Natural magic toed the\nline of science and included subjects like astrology, alchemy, and herbalism,\nalong with any ritual practices that were supposed to bring one closer to the\nChristian god. Black magic, on the other hand, was consorting with spirits.\nDivination and what we now call demonolatry would fall under the dreadful\nheader of black magic.⁶²\n\nAnd then the Protestant Reformation happened, and suddenly, it was all black\nmagic; it was all witchcraft and devil worship. And that was pretty much the\nstandard screed, right up until Victorian times, when a romanticized interest\nin Paganism started developing. But it was also during this time that black\nmagic took on racial connotations. The term started being applied to the\nreligious and magical practices of non-European cultures, particularly those\nin Haiti and the South Seas. When viewed through a European cultural grid,\nthese practices were seen as exotic, dangerous, and evil, a perception that\nwas reinforced by Hollywood, beginning in the 1920s and continuing today. The\n1932 film White Zombie, for instance, set in Haiti, pits “heroes” of European\ndescent against the powerful “African superstitions” of a sinister voodoo\nmaster.⁶³ It’s worth noting that the voodoo master is also of European\ndescent, and he’s the villain because he was “corrupted” by practicing African\nmagic.\n\nThe term white magic, on the other hand, really didn’t work its way into\ncommon vernacular until the 1960s and ’70s, when there was a concerted push to\ndifferentiate between Pagan witchcraft and Satanism, and the term remained in\nuse in the 1980s and ’90s, in defense against the ongoing Satanic Panic.\n\nAnd then, in the early 2000s, Pagans of European descent “discovered” Hoodoo,\nand they started gobbling up Crossing rituals, and Hot Foot Powder, and sour\njars, and Death unto My Enemy spells without attribution—hexing and cursing\ntechniques that, at the time, were not covered by the popular Pagan books. All\nthese co-opted Hoodoo practices remain in Witchcraft today, but they have been\nrebranded as baneful magic.\n\nIf witches describe their practices as baneful magic instead of black magic to\navoid racist connotations, and yet they are referring to African American folk\nmagic as baneful because it’s exotic and dangerous, a racial bias is still\nbeing upheld—we’re just calling it something different to draw attention away\nfrom that.\n\nInstead of categorizing hexes and curses under the special heading of baneful,\nconsider just calling them hexes and curses. From a Chaos Witchcraft\nperspective, magic is magic—any differentiation between good and bad is\nirrelevant and unnecessary.\n\n## Chaos and Appropriation\n\nWhile I normally rail against binaries, I do suspect that there are two types\nof Witches in the world: Those who saw Bring It On (2000) at an impressionable\nage, and those who did not. If you haven’t had a chance to watch this film\nyourself, here’s a synopsis.\n\nThe Rancho Carne Toros are a five-time national champion cheerleading squad\nfrom an affluent suburb outside of Los Angeles, and when the main character,\nTorrance, takes the helm as team captain, she discovers that all of her team’s\naward-winning routines had been stolen from the East Compton Clovers—a\ncheerleading squad from an inner city school. Torrance makes several attempts\nto set things right, all of which blow up in her face, and finally, the Toros\ndecide to just come up with a brand-new routine. And they do so, as per the\nscript, by studying other forms of movement and drawing inspiration from them,\nthus creating something that no one had ever seen before. And they end up\nhaving a spectacular showing at nationals, coming in second place to the\nClovers.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, the Toros started out the movie engaging in\nappropriation, which occurs whenever a given practice (or tradition, or\nfashion) that originates within a marginalized group is adopted by the members\nof a dominant group, resulting in one or more of the following outcomes:\n\nThe dominant group does not credit the marginalized group for originating the\npractice.\n\nThe dominant group denies the marginalized group access to practice.\n\nThe dominant group refuses to compensate the marginalized group while actively\nprofiting off the practice.\n\nThe dominant group condemns the marginalized group for continuing to engage in\nthe practice.\n\nLet’s look at a couple of scenarios to make sure we understand what cultural\nappropriation is. In the first scenario, you decide to make a burrito. You get\na tortilla, fill it with meat, beans, and cheese, and just to see how it\ntastes, you add some Sriracha and crushed potato chips. Then you eat it.\n\nIs this cultural appropriation?\n\nNo. This is lunch, consumed in the privacy of your own home, for nobody’s\nbenefit but your own. It is not a traditional meal by any means, but you are\nalso not attempting to capitalize on it, nor pass your culinary experiment off\nas authentic Mexican food.\n\nIn the second scenario, you open a food cart specializing in burritos and\nquickly achieve some renown for your delicious handmade tortillas. You end up\nspotlighted by a local news outlet, and during the interview, you explain that\nalthough you are not from Mexico nor of Mexican descent, you recently\nvacationed there, and you just fell in love with the tortillas—however, no one\nwould teach you how to make them. In response, you snuck around and peeked in\nkitchen windows and spied on cooks until you figured out the proper techniques\nand ingredients. Then you went home and launched a business selling\n“authentic” Mexican food.\n\nIs this cultural appropriation?\n\nAbsolutely, and it actually happened in Portland back in 2017, a city where\npeople of color were having to jump through a crushing number of hoops to open\nfood carts, only to be routinely denied permits. Meanwhile, white Portlandians\nwere not encountering the same obstacles, nor were they subjected to\ninordinate fines for not having the proper permits. And this included two\nwomen of European descent, who were running a burrito cart and went on the\nevening news to brag about stealing recipes.⁶⁴\n\nSo why, in this day and age, do things like this keep occurring, both in the\nmundane and the occult worlds? Why are closed practices still perceived as up\nfor grabs? Why do some Pagans continue to misdirect away from their own\nappropriative behaviors by blaming everything on Wicca?\n\nThe answer—or at least the Discordian answer—is painfully simple: It’s all\nbecause Greyface says so.\n\n## The Adversarial Archenemy\n\n## You Didn’t Know You Needed to Know\n\nGreyface is the personification of the Protestant-based, capitalistic culture\nin which we reside. If the Apostles of Eris—Hung Mung, Dr. Van Van Mojo, Sri\nSyadasti, Zarathud, and the Elder Malaclypse—are the avatars of Creative\nDisorder, Greyface is the avatar of Destructive Order.\n\nPage 00042 of the Principia Discordia describes Greyface with\nuncharacteristically somber words:“In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented\nhunchbrain by the name of Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was\nas humorless as he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it\ncontradicted the ways of Serious Order.”\n\nThe year 1166 BC(E) is an interesting choice for the emergence of Greyface. I\nassume that Mal-2 and Lord Omar picked that date because the digits add up to\nfive (1+1+6+6=14; 1+4=5). However, contemporary research indicates that the\nLate Bronze Age collapsed around 1177 BCE, so whether they meant to be\nhistorically accurate or not, by their reckoning, Greyface showed up right at\nthe dawn of the Iron Age.⁶⁵\n\nInexplicably, Greyface attracted followers who devoted themselves to him and\nhis oppressive beliefs unconditionally, going so far as to destroy anyone who\ndisagreed with them, or whose way of life in any way deviated from their own.\nBy teaching that the Aneristic Illusion was in fact reality and by encouraging\nhis followers to disregard Creation and Destruction as the only true polarity\nin favor of the artificial concepts of Order and Disorder, Greyface introduced\nbinary thinking into the world. And by holding up Order as more correct than\nDisorder, he forced the cultures around him to live oppressed under\nDestructive Order, with no opportunity to reclaim the freedom of Creative\nDisorder. As described by the Principia: “The unfortunate result of this is\nthat mankind has since been suffering from a psychological and spiritual\nimbalance. Imbalance causes frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear\nmakes for a bad trip. Man has been on a bad trip for a long time now.”⁶⁶\n\nThe Curse of Greyface enforces comparisons; it tells us that something can\nonly be good if something else is bad, or that\n\nfor something to achieve validity, it has to be inherently better than\nsomething else. Rooted firmly in the Protestant Christian ethics that\ninfluence all aspects of our society (whether we realize it or not), the Curse\nof Greyface demands that scapegoats and sin-eaters—individuals and groups\ndeemed lesser than—take the blame for any problems we encounter, while the\ntrue sources of those problems remain safely in the shadows.\n\nThe Curse of Greyface makes us rigid, not just in our religious beliefs, but\nin our perceptions of outside spiritualities, which only exist to be strip-\nmined and persecuted. It pits polarities against each other and breeds\nentitlement. It teaches us that fads are more important than sustainability;\nand, most detrimentally, it keeps us too distracted with infighting and\ncompetition to pay attention to real-world plights that could quite literally\nbe the death of us all.\n\nThink of how polarized the political landscape of the United States became in\nthe late 2010s and early 2020s, when marginalized groups were scapegoated by\nextremist candidates to gaslight their constituents into an Us vs. Them\nmentality. Outside of politics, we can look at what happened to Twitter for\nanother real-time analogy of Greyface in action.\n\nUp until 2022, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter was a\nlawless but joyful place. And then Elon Musk decided that he wanted it all for\nhimself and purchased it for forty-\n\nfour billion dollars, dictating new restrictions on users while firing\nengineers who had managed for years to somehow keep the platform running. Most\nworthy of cringe, he removed verifications. No longer would celebrities and\nworld leaders have a blue checkmark on their accounts to designate that they\nwere in fact who they said they were—instead, anyone could obtain a blue\ncheckmark by becoming a paid monthly subscriber.\n\nAt that moment, Musk was acting as a lackey of Greyface, and he foisted\nDestructive Order upon the Creative Disorder that was Twitter. And as we know\nfrom the Law of Eristic Escalation, whenever Destructive Order is imposed on\nCreative Disorder, Destructive Disorder results. Advertisers pulled their\nmarketing and went off to find other social media demographics, and users left\nin droves. Twitter still exists as of this writing (we’re supposed to call it\nX now), but it’s a bombed-out shell of what it once was.\n\n## Gninoitidnoced\n\nFortunately, as Chaos Witches, we have the resources to fight back against the\nagents of Destructive Disorder in the world. We just have to make the internal\ndecision—one might even call it an ethical choice—to embrace the Creative over\nthe Destructive. Just as dialectical behavioral therapy is utilized to help\npatients with emotional challenges understand that more than one concept can\nbe true at the same time, Discordianism encourages us to accept that as\nsynthetic structures, Order and Disorder are equals, not opponents.\n\nThis is where the Principle of Deconditioning comes fully into play. Those of\nus raised in a Greyface culture are used to passively listening to him, of\nautomatically thinking in terms of good and bad, or right and wrong. If you’re\ngoing to make any kind of difference as a practitioner of Chaos Witchcraft, it\nis crucial that you actively attempt to disentangle yourself from the sticky\nweb of Greyface’s lies and manipulations.\n\nIn Mastering Witchcraft, author Paul Huson presents a ritual of unbinding,\nwhich includes reading the Lord’s Prayer backward on three consecutive\nnights.⁶⁷ He also provides a phonetic transliteration, as follows:\n\nNema!\n\nLivee morf su revilled tub\n\nNoishaytpmet ootni ton suh deel\n\nSuh tshaiga sapsert tath yeth\n\nVigrawf eu za sesapsert rua suh vigrawf.\n\nDerb ilaid rua yed sith suh vig\n\nNeveh ni si za thre ni\n\nNud eeb liw eyth\n\nMuck mod-ngik eyth\n\nMain eyth eeb dwohlah\n\nNeveh ni tra chioo\n\nRertharf rua!\n\nAuthor Sarah Lyons also encourages the initiatory breaking of taboos in\nRevolutionary Witchcraft, along with crafting chain links out of construction\npaper and ritually tearing free of them. The point of these rituals is not to\nblaspheme, but to decondition; to unshackle yourself from the hold that the\nCurse of Greyface has over our culture. And the more you decondition, the more\ncapable you are of launching a few curses of your own.\n\n## Gobble, Gobble, Foil and Hobble\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Turkey Curse was devised by the Apostle Dr. Van\nVan Mojo, with the expressed purpose of disrupting the Aneristic intentions of\nGreyface and his lackeys. To throw the curse, square off against your target\nand assume the stance of an old-timey boxer. Once you have their attention,\nbegin waving your arms about mystically, take a deep breath, and gobble five\ntimes like a turkey as loudly as you can. At which point your foe will get\nweirded out and leave you alone.\n\nThe Turkey Curse can be performed as written, but it can also be understood as\na general metaphor for injecting Creative Disorder into otherwise\nDestructively Ordered situations. If you find yourself squaring off against a\ntroll on social media, try responding to their insults with polite but\ncompletely noncontextual comments: “My apologies, but I’m no longer the\nsausage king of Chicago,” or my go-to, “What a coincidence! That was my\nnickname in prison.” Speaking from personal experience, I can say that the\ntroll will inevitably be too baffled to continue the conversation. You could\nalso purchase a blue checkmark on Twitter, impersonate pharmaceutical giant\nEli Lilly, and announce to the world that insulin is now free—another thing\nthat actually happened.⁶⁸\n\nWhen Musk did away with Twitter’s verification process, users did in fact pay\nmoney for those coveted blue checkmarks. However, they then utilized their\nnewfound online clout to create parody accounts, putting truly unhinged\nstatements in the mouths of celebrities, politicians, and big businesses, to\namazing effect. In the previous case, Eli Lilly was forced to publicly admit\nthat insulin was not actually free—an announcement which caused their stock to\nplummet. To amend the ensuing PR disaster, the out-of-pocket cost of insulin\nwas capped at thirty-five dollars, making it actually affordable to those who\nneeded it to survive.\n\nThis is the kind of benevolent impact that the lunacy of the Turkey Curse can\nhave in our Aneristic world. Regardless of your personal ethics, as a Chaos\nWitch, your higher calling is the magical application of Creative Disorder.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## The Pringles® Can Curse\n\nThe Pringles® Can Curse was originally devised by social media omni-lord Riot\nAddams, and it is reprinted here with his permission along with a couple of\ntweaks by me, based on Discordianism and personal preference.\n\n## You will need\n\nA stick of incense\n\nAn empty can of Pringles® with some crumbs at the bottom (Riot suggests Sour\nCream and Onion, although I’d go with Salt and Vinegar)\n\nA handful of dirt (just regular dirt, although graveyard dirt would also work\nwell)\n\nKallisti Powder (recipe follows the directions)\n\nA packet of hot sauce\n\nCigarette butts (or any other gross trash)\n\nA bottle of nighttime liquid cold medicine\n\nBroken glass or nails\n\nPaper and pen\n\nA full cup of water (moon or otherwise)\n\nDuct tape\n\nA votive candle (of the color of your choice)\n\n## Directions\n\nLight the incense and cense the can, inside and out. Pour the dirt in the can,\nto bury your enemy. Add the Kallisti Powder, then squeeze the hot sauce into\nthe can and drop the empty packet in as well. Add the butts or the trash\n(because they’re garbage), then pour in a good swig of the cold medicine (to\nput them to sleep). Add the broken glass or nails, then write your target’s\nname on a slip of paper, fold it five times—always folding away from you—then\nset it on fire, and drop it into the can. Follow this immediately with the\nwater.\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that the paper fire is out, put the lid back on the can\nand seal it shut with the duct tape, as Riot says, “Like it’s the coffin our\nenemies will be resting in.” Set the candle on top of the can. Once it’s\nburned all the way down (the candle, that is, not the entire can), dispose of\nthe spell remains far away from your home.\n\nWhether or not you actually cast the Pringles® Can Curse is entirely up to you\nand your own personal ethics. If hexing or cursing isn’t your thing, I promise\nthat’s fine: You are absolutely not required to curse anyone or anything if it\nconflicts with your personal moral code, or even if you just don’t feel like\ndoing it.\n\nAnd if you’re really into hexing and cursing, I promise that’s fine as well.\nWhatever magical work you do, “baneful” or not, is strictly between you and\nyour gods. If they’re cool with it, then I’m cool with it too.\n\n## Recipe for Kallisti Powder\n\nAdding Kallisti Powder to a hex or curse is the Chaos Witchcraft equivalent of\ntossing a golden apple into a wedding banquet. It is a blend of the following:\n\n1 part black mustard seeds\n\n1 part ground patchouli leaves\n\n1 part poppy seeds\n\n1 part red pepper flakes\n\n5–23 parts gold glitter (measure with your heart)\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 10\n\n\n## Chaos\n\n## Spirituality\n\nThere’s no denying that any permutation of Witchcraft—be it religious or\notherwise—is, on some level, a spiritual pursuit. But what does that really\nmean? I’ve met any number of people who describe themselves as spiritual, not\nreligious, but depending on the context, that could translate to anything from\n“I’m extremely religious and don’t want to admit it,” to “I enjoy occasional\nmeditation,” to “I’m dead inside, but crystals are pretty.”\n\nWithin 12-step programs, recovering addicts and alcoholics talk about\nspirituality a lot, and when I first got sober, I found myself stymied by\nthat. I mean, I got that God (singular or plural) was somehow involved, but I\ncouldn’t help noticing that everyone kept saying “spiritual” without offering\nany insight into what they meant by that.\n\nLet’s take some time to deconstruct the notion of spirituality, and how it\napplies to the framework of Chaos Witchcraft. It won’t be an easy process, but\nthere will be moments of fun and silliness to balance out any potential\ndiscomfort.\n\nAnd to get the ball rolling, let’s turn to the Principia Discordia for some\ndirection.\n\n## Brother in Spirit\n\nAt some point after the universe was up and running, Void found himself\nvaguely dissatisfied. He’d made Eris and Aneris, who were keeping themselves\nbusy creating and destroying things, but all their machinations were physical\nin nature. There was nothing metaphysical going on; no soul to gain awareness\nof all the Chaos, much less enjoy it.\n\nVoid decided to take some time off and sort this out, so he locked himself in\nhis Void cave for five eras. And when he emerged, Eris and Aneris were\nstartled to discover that he’d given birth to another child:\nSpirituality—whom, the Principia points out, had no name at all.⁶⁹\n\nEris and Aneris were pretty uncomfortable with the whole affair—not because\ntheir dad was once again spontaneously shooting out babies like a seahorse,\nbut because of a shared worry that Void would give all his attention to the\nnew kid.\n\n“My girls, you have nothing to worry about,” Void assured them. “I love all my\nchildren equally. And to prove it, we’re going to co-parent!”\n\nEris and Aneris were skeptical.\n\n“No, really,” Void said. It’s going to be great. Since he has no form,\nSpirituality will start out living with Aneris in a state of Non-Being. But\nthen he’ll get to go live with Eris in a state of Being.”\n\n“Wait a second,” Eris said. “Aneris destroys everything I create. Once\nSpirituality comes to live with me, Aneris will destroy him too.”\n\n“Oh, yeah,” Aneris said, popping a handful of freshly minted planetoids in her\nmouth and munching away. “I totally will.”\n\n“Okay … good point,” Void said. “So how about this: Spirituality will live\nwith Aneris, then live with Eris, and after that, he’ll come back and stay\nwith me.”\n\nWhich leads us to a line from the Principia that never fails to give me goose\nbumps: “And so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do; and then it is\nthat we play with our world of existent things, and order and disorder them,\nand so it shall be that non-\n\nexistence shall take us back from existence and that nameless spirituality\nshall return to Void, like a tired child home from a very wild circus.”⁷⁰\n\nSpirituality is, at least in part, the sentience of the human experience: From\nnonexistence we were created, and, after the series of wacky misadventures\nthat is life, to the void we shall return. And I really like this definition,\nbecause it clears away some of the vagueness around the idea, and it gives us\nsomething to consider.\n\nEventually, I found another, more concrete definition that worked well for me,\nand that I think will work well for you too.\n\nSpirituality is the process of becoming who we’re supposed to be.\n\nAlcohol prevented me from being myself, so as part of the spiritual process, I\ncut it out of my life. Witchcraft is an inherent part of who I am, so pursuing\nit is also part of the spiritual process. Discordianism grants me a profound\nsense of where I’ve been and where I’m going, so it’s a huge part of the\nspiritual process. Spirituality is sentience, but as sentient beings, we have\nthe chance to figure out where our potential lies, and how to go about\nunlocking and achieving it. That, my friends, is our spiritual journey.\n\n## Another Fruitful Wedding\n\nThe Principia asserts that Spirituality has no name, but Greek mythology\nsuggests otherwise. Iasion (pronounced Aision), the legendary founder of the\nSamothracian Mysteries, was described as the brother of Harmonia (Aneris),\nwhich, in a Discordian worldview, would make him the brother of Eris and\ntherefore a human incarnation of Spirituality.\n\nAs the story goes, Iasion was a guest at the wedding of Harmonia and the hero\nCadmus, but he was lured away by Demeter to “lie in a thrice-plowed field,”\nwhich is my new favorite euphemism for anything NC-17. Zeus was also at the\nwedding, and, consumed with jealousy (read: hypocrisy) when he learned of\nDemeter’s tryst, killed Iasion with a lightning bolt.\n\nWhat we have, then, is Iasion moving from a state of Non-\n\nBeing (a non-player character at Harmonia’s wedding) to a state of Being\n(thrice-plowed field), and then returning to Void (obliteration via Zeus).\nIt’s hardcore Discordianism cleverly disguised as a classical myth, and I for\none am pleased by that.\n\nOf course, if you don’t want to identify Iasion with Spirituality, that’s\ncool. It’s also cool if you don’t want to slap a name on any aspect of the\nDivine, or if you’d rather just focus on becoming yourself.\n\nThat just means you’re spiritual, not religious. And as it turns out, there is\nnothing wrong with that. It’s actually a really good place to start.\n\n## Send In the Clown Witches\n\nAbove all else, as a Chaos Witch, you should be enjoying your magical\npractice. As Phil Hine wrote in his book Condensed Chaos, “Magic is\nfun—otherwise, why do it?”⁷¹ Fun is, in and of itself, a spiritual pursuit.\n\nIn Lights, Camera, Witchcraft: A Critical History of Witches in American Film\nand Television, author Heather Greene identifies numerous archetypes present\namong big- and small-screen Witches, including the Accused Woman, the Wild\nChild, the Vamp, the Folk Witch, the Halloween Witch, the Fantasy Crone, the\nMagical Mom, and the Good Fairy. Most of these are easily recognizable—picture\nthe characters in your favorite Witch movie, and you’ll be able to match them\nup with at least one.\n\nBut of all the archetypes Greene coins, the one that jumped out at me the\nmost, and the one that is most relevant to the spirituality of Chaos\nWitchcraft, is the Clown Witch.\n\nAccording to Greene, one of the earliest appearances of the Clown Witch is\nMomba, the Wicked Witch in the 1910 film The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Momba’s\ncostume contains distinctive Victorian clown motifs, such as an oversized\ncollar, poofy sleeves, and a pointy hat, which suggest that while she’s the\nBig Bad of the movie, her job is to entertain rather than frighten. Greene\nalso points to Mother Goose as a good example of the Victorian Clown Witch\naesthetic.\n\nFrom a storytelling standpoint, Clown Witches are not evil. But they are\nmischievous, and they act as foils to the protagonists—in other words, they\nare agents of Creative Disorder. Endora from Bewitched and Aunt Queenie from\nBell Book and Candle are Clown Witches, down to their flamboyant clothes and\ncurly red hair, which, Greene notes, is reminiscent of iconic clown wigs.\n\nWhile she’s not explicitly mentioned as such in Lights, Camera, Witchcraft,\nHilda Spellman from The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is an amazing Clown\nWitch. She’s technically more of a Halloween Witch and a Magical Mom, but she\nwas also the funniest person on the show, and she often thwarted the plans of\nthe characters with nefarious agendas, disrupting Destructive Order with her\nown take on the Turkey Curse. The scene in the fifth episode of the second\nseason (released on April 5, 2019) in which she assassinated her sister’s\nrival via almond cookies full of arsenic is a prime example.\n\nWhen it comes to their spiritual development, Clown Witches embrace who they\nare, and they either play by their own rules, or they make up the rules as\nthey go along. Uncle Arthur from Bewitched teleports into the Stevens’s living\nroom whenever he feels like it; Double Trouble from She-Ra and the Princesses\nof Power is more concerned about giving a good performance than whether or not\nthey’re on the side of good or evil. Often queer coded and always\nextraordinary, Clown Witches are emancipated and, much like Phil Hine, exist\nto remind us that magic should be fun.\n\nIndigenous Lakota and Dakota cultures have the heyoka, or sacred clown, and\nWestern European history gives us satyr plays, court jesters, and the Lord of\nMisrule, all of which serve to parody social mores. However, the Clown Witch\noperates outside of them. Spiritually, they become who they’re supposed to be\nby refusing to let anyone else make that decision for them. Turning to the\nPrincipia, we find the following:\n\nMagicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have\nsought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal\nopposites—good/evil, positive/negative, male/female, etc. But due to the\nsteadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the\nshaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important\npairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and\nSERIOUS/HUMOROUS.\n\nThis is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult\nthought, and [the Paratheo-Anametamystikhood Of Eris Esoteric] is humbly\npleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.⁷²\n\nIf we take the Principia as a clowning manual (and why wouldn’t we?), we can\nglean that the Clown Witch’s role is to actively use magic fueled with humor\nto generate more humor. Ergo, the creation and spreading of humor—especially\nhumor that helps others laugh at and accept themselves—is a spiritual pursuit.\n\nThere are a lot of examples of Clown Witches to be found outside of American\ncinema and television, the two stuck in my childhood memories being Witchiepoo\nfrom H. R. Pufnstuf and Benita Bizarre from The Bugaloos. And they are\nawesome, but when you’re looking for Clown Witches to exemplify on your\nspiritual journey, you’ll want to narrow down the list to those who have the\nqualities you most want to embody.\n\nYou’ll want to focus on the Clown Witches who are self-\n\npossessed and able to do whatever they please, all while entertaining anyone\naround them with irreverence and a little light blasphemy—the Sisters of\nPerpetual Indulgence, an order of drag nuns founded in San Francisco in the\nlate 1970s, would fit this bill nicely. And if you pick up some fabulous\nmakeup and styling tips along the way, that’ll just boost your Clown Witch\nmystique even further.\n\nPeter J. Carroll once wrote that laughter is the highest emotion, since it can\nencompass all other emotions and has no opposite. And Phil Hine confirms that\nlaughter is an effective form of ritual banishing, and that it can also be\nused “to deflate the pompous, self-important occult windbags that one runs\ninto from time to time.”⁷³ Plus, as Mal-2 once said, “Sometimes I take humor\nseriously. Sometimes I take seriousness humorously.” Acknowledging the\nsymbiosis of magic and humor, and in turn, acknowledging that you yourself are\na magical, humorous being, will be a great leap forward as your own\nspirituality evolves.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## Glamourbombs\n\nClown Witches are more than capable of binding or cursing, but they\nspiritually come into their own when their magic takes the form of what author\nand activist Hakim Bey branded poetic terrorism or what is known in some\nsparkling corners of the internet as glamourbombing.\n\nOriginating as a concept in the Otherkin community, a glamourbomb is,\naccording to Urban Dictionary, “Any public act or work that aims to inspire\ngenuine curiosity and childlike befuddlement, a change of thought process,\nbelief in magic, belief in the fae, and/or a sense of wonder in the\nrecipient.”⁷⁴ Glamourbombing often involves mundane, everyday items used or\nplaced in an unusual manner. For example, leaving spare change on a sidewalk,\nbut arranging the coins into a letter, number, or symbol. Or writing out vague\nbut helpful advice on a notecard, signing it with the name of a god or an\nangel, and slipping it between the pages of a random library book. Or giving\nout handmade holiday cards to strangers at any time other than the holiday\nseason in question.\n\nI once traced my hand on a wooden fence next to the parking lot of a late-\nnight restaurant, drew a sigil in the palm, and scrawled Place Hand Here to\nChange Your Life above it. I also added Results May Vary in parentheses\nunderneath it. The restaurant allowed customers to doodle on the fence (please\nkeep in mind that vandalism is illegal). I don’t know if anyone actually tried\nplacing their hand there, but it remained on the fence well over a year before\nthe restaurant repainted.\n\n![](../Images/image-06FYJMDB.jpg)\n\nThe Traced Hand\n\nOf course, the Clown Witch could also choose to direct their glamourbombs into\npractical jokes with satirical edges that doubled as political\nstatements—which, in Discordian spaces, would be known as a jake. For\ninstance, what would happen if a far-right congressional representative’s\nphone settings somehow glitched, and he could only tweet in Esperanto? What if\na well-known trans-\n\nexclusive radical feminist started hiccupping uncontrollably whenever she\ntried to say anything hateful? You know how, in Practical Magic, Gillian fixes\nit so that Sally ends up at the top of the phone tree? How might that\ntranslate into a chucklesome, real-world application?\n\nWhat if every conspiracy theorist in your district got the date of Election\nDay wrong and showed up at the polling station a week after the fact?\n\nCould Witchcraft bring about any of those situations? I can really only shrug\nin response, but I can also reiterate that you won’t know until you try. And\neven if the magic doesn’t work the way you expect it to, you’ll still get some\neducation in the process—and learning more about yourself and what you can do\nwill always contribute toward your spiritual growth.\n\n## Shadow Work\n\n## [Insert Ominous Thunderclap Here]\n\nAs important as laughter is, though, both in Witchcraft and the mundane world,\nspirituality is not all fun and games. Becoming who we’re supposed to be takes\neffort, and it is not a painless process. Which means it’s time to discuss\nshadow work.\n\nAs hard as I try, I can’t get away from shadow work. And by that, I mean no\nmatter where I look, people will not stop talking about it. It has certainly\nbecome a popular term to bandy about, but it doesn’t really seem to have much\nmeaning behind it—or at least, it’s being shoehorned into conversations\nwithout anyone really knowing what they mean when they say it. Are we talking\nabout initiatory ordeals? Shamanic crises? Psychoanalysis? Cognitive-\n\nbehavioral therapy? The Hero’s Journey? All of these include concepts that\ncould be described as shadow work, but there’s not an overarching shadow work\npennant under which we can cram them.\n\nLet’s dig a little into the origin of the term and find a definition we can\nactually use.\n\nThe Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung defined the shadow as the unconscious part of\nthe human psyche, similar to Sigmund Freud’s concept of the Id. It’s our\nanimal nature, and it gives us the potential for both Creation and\nDestruction. As humans, we tend to reject or ignore the parts of ourselves we\ndon’t like, and those parts can become aspects of our shadows. Or, if we’re\nwrestling with, say, low self-esteem, our shadows could be composed of\npositive things that don’t gel with our negative self-image.\n\nThe goal of Jungian psychology, then, is to learn to acknowledge and accept\nthe shadow, thus integrating the unconscious and the conscious selves into a\nWhole Person™. Which is nowhere near as easy as it sounds (and it honestly\ndoesn’t even sound that easy).\n\nI am not quite sure how shadow work made the jump into modern Witchcraft, but\nit’s currently as prevalent a topic as moon water and cord cutting. And while\nI do think actively working to integrate one’s shadow can make one a healthier\nperson and in turn a more competent and effective Witch, it’s important to\nrealize that a) it’s a long-term process, not a one-time ritual, and b) it can\nbe painful and scary and damaging.\n\nAnd I really want to reiterate here that shadow work is, in the grand occult\nscheme of things, a very new concept. Medieval Witches were not all up in each\nother’s business like, “It sounds liketh ye’re goyng through somethyng,\nRowena. Ye should really doon some shadowe werk about it.”\n\nIf you want to pursue shadow work as part of your personal practice, that’s\nawesome. In fact, Kelly-Ann Maddox offers some solid resources on shadow work\nin Rebel Witch: Carve the Craft That’s Yours Alone, which I highly recommend.\nI personally got a lot out of The Velvet Rage: Overcoming the Pain of Growing\nUp Gay in a Straight Man’s World by Alan Downs. It’s not a self-help book per\nse, but it did help me identify some of the sources of my own internalized\ntrauma and shame, which I was able to address through therapy and recovery.\n\nWhatever you do, just keep in mind that as a psychological theory, shadow work\nis not Traditional Craft or anything. It’s a tool that’s compatible with\nWitchcraft, but it is emphatically not a requirement.\n\n## Searching and Fearless\n\nProbably the best contemporary non-Witchcraft example of something that could\nbe considered shadow work is 12-Step recovery, specifically Steps Four and\nFive:\n\nFour—Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.\n\nFive—Admitted to [the] God[s], to ourselves, and to another human being the\nexact nature of our wrongs.⁷⁵\n\nIn practice, a “searching and fearless moral inventory” means writing out a\nlist of the people we resent, the reasons we resent them, the things those\nresentments affect (self-esteem, financial security, etc.), and “our\npart”—meaning what we’ve done to contribute to a given resentment, or why\nwe’re unable to let it go.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say this was one of the hardest things I’ve ever\ndone.\n\nComing up with the list of people was actually easy, since I’d been internally\ncategorizing them for years. The difficulty was looking at my part in those\nresentments. The more I wrote, the more I had to face that I was extremely\nentitled and thought the world owed me a lot of damn favors. And I ended up\nfeeling like a really, really bad person.\n\nBut that’s why those of us in recovery work with sponsors—recovering\nalcoholics who have already been through the Steps, and who can keep us moving\nforward and help us learn how to forgive ourselves and start healing. My own\nsponsor had me write out a fear inventory along with my resentments, which\nultimately forced me to look at my untreated anxiety issues and do something\nabout them. I probably wouldn’t have sought treatment when I did if I hadn’t\nhad someone there to help me identify the problem and coax me into getting it\nmanaged.\n\nThe point here is that if you’re going to engage in any kind of shadowy self-\nexploration, you need to do so with someone else acting as a guide and/or\nspotter: a sponsor, a licensed therapist, or even a covenmate you trust\nimplicitly. Trying to assimilate your unconscious without any kind of\nsupervision or support—at least when you’re first getting into it—will be\nineffective at best and psychologically scarring at worst.\n\nOnce you’ve accomplished some integration with someone else tethering you, you\ncan start doing work independently, like how those of us in recovery utilize\nStep Ten to “take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted\nit.”⁷⁶\n\nIf you’re going to throw yourself into shadow work, my one nonnegotiable rule\nis this: Be kind to yourself. I mean it. Even with outside support, it’s easy\nto slip into dark places when we’re looking at the ugly parts of ourselves, so\nit is almost medically necessary that we treat ourselves as gently as possible\nwhile we’re in the middle of it.\n\nAnd you know what? If you never find a decent starting point, or if you just\nfeel like shadow work isn’t something you’re interested in exploring, that’s\ntotally okay too. Above and beyond anything else, whether we’re banging around\nthe unconscious or not, we always need to be honest with ourselves. If your\nobjective assessment is “no shadow work for me,” then you’re facing the\nsituation and speaking your truth. And I cannot help but be proud of you for\nthat.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## A Step in the Right Direction\n\nAnother aspect of Step 4 is the fear inventory, which is exactly what it\nsounds like: writing out a comprehensive list of everything that scares you,\nalong with the things that those fears affect. Elevators were on my fear\ninventory. I’ve been cleithrophobic—afraid of being trapped or restrained—for\nas long as I can remember, and elevators exacerbate that phobia, which\naffected my self-esteem, pride, sense of security, and personal relationships.\nCockroaches also made the list, as did fear of abandonment.\n\nIt was rough going, but I learned a couple of important things from the\nprocess—namely, that all fears are valid, and that I was not to blame for\nhaving those fears in the first place. Which was a big step toward letting\nthem go.\n\nNow, and only if you’re feeling up to it, you’re going to let go of a fear.\n\n## You will need\n\nA makeup pencil (eyebrow or lip)\n\nBaby wipes (preferably with aloe or other\n\nskin-soothing ingredients)\n\n## Directions\n\nThink of a small fear: something you perceive as irrational. Maybe you’re\nafraid that your favorite television show won’t get renewed, or that someone\nin your workplace secretly doesn’t appreciate your sense of style. Again, make\nsure it’s something small—we’re not trying to cure a panic disorder or\nanything with this exercise.\n\nOnce you have the fear in mind, come up with a sigil to represent it using one\nof the methods in chapter 7 or an outside method that works well for you.\nUsing the makeup pencil, draw the sigil on your arm.\n\nBlow on the sigil gently, and then, using one of the baby wipes, slowly remove\nthe sigil, wiping away from yourself as you do so. Once the sigil is gone, wad\nup the wipe and throw it in the trash, then call your best friend and tell\nthem about the fear, and the leap you took toward letting it go.\n\nAnd after the spell is cast, relax, unwind, and reward yourself with a sweet\ntreat.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 11\n\n\n## Chaos\n\n## Divination\n\nI honestly do not know why divination—the art of obtaining information through\nesoteric means—is not talked about more often in Chaos Magic spaces. I’ve\nnever encountered a Chaos practitioner who looks down their nose at\ndivination, but as a topic of discussion, it just doesn’t seem to come up with\nany kind of regularity.\n\nAnd that’s a shame, because out of all the occult disciplines, divination is\nthe one that really lends itself to Chaos Magic in general and Chaos\nWitchcraft in particular. After all, one of our key principles is Diversity in\nApproach, and divination provides a wild variety of methods with which to\nexperiment.\n\nThat variety can be a bit overwhelming, so please remember that you don’t have\nto become an expert in all of them—learning what you can about one or two\nsystems will prove far more useful than trying to master thirty-two of them at\nonce. But having a method of divination that grants consistently clear answers\nwill be invaluable to you as a Witch, whether you want insight into what the\nresults of a particular spell will be, receive a message from the gods and\nspirits you venerate, or just get an unbiased second opinion on a judgment\ncall.\n\nMy own preferred method of divination is lithomancy—which means I read with\nsemiprecious stones—and I’ve included a lithomantic tutorial later in this\nchapter. Regardless of the divinatory system that calls to you, there are\ntechniques you can use to improve your skills. And if all else fails, you can\npeer into the future by simply listening to music, which we will get into in\nthis chapter as well.\n\n## Divining Right In\n\nOther Chaos principles that can be applied to divination are Immersion and\nDiscipline—the metaphysical equivalent of starting a juice cleanse and\nsticking with it until you see results. And the best way to immerse yourself\nin divination and establish a disciplined practice is to construct a set of\nbeliefs around a given divinatory system and nurture a unique, spiritual\nrelationship with each card, rune, knucklebone, or whatever else is a standard\ntool of that system.\n\nOnce you’ve settled on a method of divination that you’d like to work with,\nchoose a card/rune/etc. and place it in a prominent location in your home\nwhere you will see it every day. If you have an altar, you can put it there.\nFor the next five days, learn everything you can about its symbolism. Make a\nconcerted effort to see if you can identify the archetypes expressed by that\nsymbol in the world around you. Also (and this is the hinge), set aside any\nother religious beliefs you may have, and treat that symbol like a deity in\nits own right. Pray to it, give it offerings, do whatever you would to\nvenerate the gods of your personal pantheon.\n\nAfter five days have passed, thank the symbol for what it taught you, then\npull the next card or rune and start over, making that new symbol the center\nof your belief system.\n\n## Lenormadness Takes Control\n\nTo get a better picture of how to approach divination from an immersive and\ndisciplined perspective, let’s look at Lenormand playing cards, which derive\nfrom a late eighteenth-century parlor game called The Game of Hope.⁷⁷\nLenormand is not as well known as tarot, but it is a smaller deck with\nstandardized images, so as an example, it will be easy to digest.\n\nThere are thirty-six cards in a traditional Lenormand deck, each associated\nwith a regular playing card. The Lenormand cards are, in order:\n\nThe Rider (9H)\n\nThe Clover (6D)\n\nThe Ship (10S)\n\nThe Home (KH)\n\nThe Tree (7H)\n\nThe Clouds (KC)\n\nThe Snake (QC)\n\nThe Coffin (9D)\n\nThe Bouquet (QS)\n\nThe Scythe (JD)\n\nThe Birch Rod (JC)\n\nThe Birds (7D)\n\nThe Child (JS)\n\nThe Fox (9C)\n\nThe Bear (10C)\n\nThe Star (6H)\n\nThe Stork (QH)\n\nThe Dog (10H)\n\nThe Tower (6S)\n\nThe Garden (8S)\n\nThe Mountain (8C)\n\nThe Crossroad (QD)\n\nThe Mice (7C)\n\nThe Heart (JH)\n\nThe Ring (AC)\n\nThe Book (10D)\n\nThe Letter (7S)\n\nThe Gentleman (AH)\n\nThe Lady (AS)\n\nThe Lily (KS)\n\nThe Sun (AD)\n\nThe Moon (8H)\n\nThe Key (8D)\n\nThe Fish (KD)\n\nThe Anchor (9D)\n\nThe Cross (6C)\n\nTo start developing your relationship with the Lenormand system, you’ll begin\nwith the Rider (indicative of news, visitors, luggage, and a potential love\ninterest if the querent is attracted to men). For five days, you’ll absorb as\nmuch knowledge as possible about the Rider, and any prayers or petitions you\nmight have will be addressed to him, those petitions being specific to the\nconcepts he represents. For instance, if you’re in the market for a new\nboyfriend, the Rider would be the right spirit to invoke.\n\nIn a Lenormand spread, cards are often read in pairs, so you’ll also want to\nuse this time to familiarize yourself with the different ways the Rider\ninteracts with other symbols. (A journal is going to be indispensable for this\nexperiment.) Additionally, you’ll keep an eye out for any appearances of the\nRider in your day-to-day life, paying special attention to arrivals, be they\npackages or people. And when those five days are up, you’ll give thanks to the\nRider for spending the week with you, leaving a small token of gratitude for\nhim. (Nine candy hearts would be appropriate.) The following morning, you’ll\npull out the Clover card and repeat the entire process.\n\nIn taking on this pilgrimage, you will find that some of the spirits will be\neasy to interact with, while others will present challenges. And you may feel\nlike you’re putting extraneous restrictions on yourself, or uselessly capping\nyour own abilities, which, in a way, you are. But you’re also building from\nthe ground up within an alien paradigm and figuring out how to orient\nyourself—the longer you work with your oracle and its associated spirits, the\nmore room you’ll have to grow and experiment. After sojourning through the\nentire system, you’ll be able to come back to your original practice much more\nadept at divination.\n\nI’ll tell you, though: It will get uncomfortable. It’s one thing to move back\nand forth between, say, non-initiatory Wicca and nondenominational\nPaganism—they’re similar enough in praxis that you won’t get carsick jumping\nfrom one to the other. But in this new belief system, there may not be any\nfamiliar touchstones. Want to check in with Eris? Oops, sorry. Try again when\nthe Snake card comes up. Longing for a ritual tool? You’ve got a Scythe and a\nBirch Rod. Go crazy with that.\n\nDiscipline means working through the cards in order, giving each the same\namount of your attention, and not skipping ahead to the cards you think will\nbe more useful or interesting. But it’s an exciting process, even if it’s also\na little scary. It’s like going on safari, or wandering into an old building\nfull of ghosts and weird antiques. Belief is a tool, after all, and once you\nmake it all the way through your deck or your stones or what have you, you\nwill have a nifty, finely tuned utensil to incorporate into your Chaos\nWitchcraft. Plus, you may find that you have a lot more appreciation for the\ntools already in your possession. And having survived the experience, you will\nbe good and seasoned and ready to throw yourself into another one.\n\n## Chaos Rocks\n\nA big part of approaching magic from the perspective of a Chaos Witch is being\naware of the boundaries and limitations of any given situation, and then\nfiguring out ways to make stuff happen within them, or to circumvent them all\ntogether. It’s not always so much about shifting the paradigm as it is\nrewiring the paradigm from the inside.\n\nAnd a really solid opportunity to see Chaos Magical Theory in action comes\nfrom lithomancy, my all-time favorite method of divination. I touched on\nlithomancy in the book Virgo Witch, but I want to go more in depth with it\nhere, to emphasize that Chaos Magic is more than just sigils and\nservitors—it’s diving into any field that interests you, metaphysical or\notherwise, learning whatever you can, then putting your new knowledge to work\nto see what kind of results you get, and to see if those results can be\nrepeated.\n\nThere are historical accounts of lithomantic divination, although the practice\nlooked very different from how it’s usually depicted today—it was basically\njust, Find a good rock and listen for the screams. The ninth-century Roman\nphysician Eusebius, for example, had a chunk of meteorite he called a baetelum\nthat would allegedly emit shrill sounds, which he could interpret and use to\nhelp diagnose patients, and the Greek seer Helenus owned a lodestone, which\nhad been given to him by Apollo, and which would speak in the voice of a\nchild.⁷⁸ According to myth (and to slide in a reference to Discordianism\nwherever I can), the lodestone was able to warn Helenus of the impending fall\nof Troy.\n\nModern, non-audial lithomancy was first promoted by Doreen Valiente in her\n1978 book Witchcraft for Tomorrow, and I have found that it’s a much more\neffective method of divination than just sitting around and waiting for the\nstones to clap back. As Valiente describes, “It requires thirteen stones, the\ntypical witches’ number, namely seven stones for the seven planets, plus a\nlife stone, a luck stone, a love stone, a home stone, a news stone, and a\nmagic stone.”⁷⁹\n\nThe stones are divided into two categories: planetary and personal. The\nplanetary meanings are:\n\nSun—Energy, cheerfulness, vitality, and authority figures.\n\nMoon—Emotions, change, intuition, and maternal figures.\n\nMercury—Communication, intelligence, strategy, gambling, and a nonbinary\nperson.\n\nVenus—Unions, harmony, fidelity, happiness, and a woman.\n\nMars—Strife, courage, defense, conflict, and a man.\n\nJupiter—Money, authority, justice, and prosperity.\n\nSaturn—Restriction, delay, purification, and longevity.\n\nAnd the personal meanings are:\n\nLife—Milestone events, nature, physical and mental health, and things one\ncan’t control.\n\nLuck—Chance occurrences, passion, willpower, and outside assistance.\n\nLove—Intimacy, compassion, healing, and reconciliation.\n\nHome—Security, personal property, family, and friends.\n\nNews—Information, wishes, hopes and dreams, and inspiration.\n\nMagic—The ruling factor, the unexpected, timing,\n\nand the Divine.\n\nTo perform a reading, make a circle on a table or the floor with a length of\ncord; the circle should have a diameter of roughly a foot and a half, just to\ngive the stones room to spread out. Trace along the inside of the circle with\nyour finger to smooth out any bumps or kinks in the cord, then (gently) toss\nor drop the stones into the center of the circle. The Magic stone is the\nIndicator, and yes-no questions are answered by the Jupiter and Saturn\nstones—if the Indicator is closer to Jupiter, the answer is yes; if it’s\ncloser to Saturn, the answer is no; and if it lands equidistant between\nJupiter and Saturn, the answer is maybe.\n\nAs for the rest of the stones, Valiente encouraged the reader to use their\nintuition, which is either brutally unhelpful or refreshingly liberating,\ndepending on your point of view. Personally, I see it as liberating—and over\nthe years, other lithomancers have developed some useful techniques to explain\nwhat the stones have to say in various positions.\n\nStart off by locating the Indicator and determine if it’s closer to Jupiter or\nSaturn. This will tell you if the overall reading is favorable or unfavorable.\nAfter that, look at the other nearby stones, and see if their meanings clarify\nthe favorability/unfavorability. Finally, look for clusters of stones, and the\nshapes made by those clusters.\n\nStraight horizontal or vertical lines suggest linear progressions of events.\nDiagonal lines can represent progressions of events that are connected, even\nif they appear unrelated at first glance. Curves indicate resistance (upward),\nor lack thereof (downward). Triangles mean that everything is in place for the\nquerent (that is, the person you’re reading for) to move forward. The stones\ncomprising the triangle will tell you what those things are. Squares mean that\ncertain factors need to come together as a foundation for the querent to move\nforward, but those factors are not in place yet. The stones comprising the\nsquare will tell you what those factors are.\n\nIt will definitely take some practice to interpret your lithomantic spreads,\nbut once you get a feel for it, it can be a surprisingly accurate method of\ndivination. When you’re starting out, stick to yes-no readings until you have\na good feel for things, then branch out and start focusing your attention on\nthe various patterns created by the positions of the other stones, which will\nyield answers like, “Yes, and here’s why,” and, “No, because of these\nfactors.”\n\n## ACWAP\n\nNow that you’ve got the fundamentals down, let’s do some rearranging to make\nlithomancy ACWAP (As Chaos Witchcraft As Possible).\n\nSince the classical planets correspond to the colors of the sephiroth in\nHermetic Qabalah, and those colors are represented by the arrows of the Chaos\nStar, I’m going to move the Magic stone to the Planetary column so that all\neight arrows are represented. Additionally, the Personal stones are sometimes\nequated with the classical Elements, which means they also have Discordian\nElemental counterparts.\n\nIf you incorporate these Chaos and Discordian concepts into your lithomancy,\nand you change the planetary and personal headers to magical and elemental,\nhere’s what you end up with:\n\nSun—Ego\n\nMoon—Sex\n\nMercury—Thinking\n\nVenus—Partnership\n\nMars—War\n\nJupiter—Wealth\n\nSaturn—Death\n\nMagic—Magic\n\nLife—Boom\n\nLuck—Orange\n\nLove—Sweet\n\nHome—Prickle\n\nNews—Pungent\n\nThe core meanings of the stones remain the same, but now you have very\nspecific keywords for your readings. Additionally, the personal/elemental\nstones can represent things that can be heard, seen, tasted, touched, and\nsmelled.\n\nNow, regarding the materials of the stones themselves, Valiente has this to\nsay: “My own set of stones consists of a mixture of stones which I have found\nand those which I have bought … [O]ne’s set of divining stones should be\nindividual to oneself, satisfying one’s own idea of what is right in this way\nand appealing to one’s own inner mind.”⁸⁰\n\nWhat this tells us is that stone doesn’t have to be taken literally—any small\nobjects of roughly the same size and shape will work for lithomantic\ndivination. I started out with antique marbles that originally belonged to my\nfather and grandfather, and I eventually graduated to gaming dice: ten-sided\ndice for Death, Wealth, Partnership, Ego, Sex, Thinking, and War; an eight-\nsided die for Pungent; a twelve-sided die for Sweet; a six-sided die for\nPrickle; a four-sided die for Orange; and twenty-sided dice for Boom and\nMagic.\n\nAnd while I do use actual stones as my primary lithomantic tools, I still\nenjoy using gaming dice, since their varied shapes and edges mean that they\ncan clearly point to each other, adding a directional flow to the information\npresented in readings. Plus I’ll only be out a few cents if I ever need to\nreplace one of them. I also have an irrational but deep-seated aversion to\ntabletop role-playing games, so working something traditionally associated\nwith TTRPGs into my Witchcraft forces me out of my self-imposed comfort zone.\n\nAs a postscript, the magic words Valiente provides—to be chanted three times\nbefore casting the stones—are ADA ADA IO ADA DIA.⁸¹ Valiente believed that\nthey derived from Welsh, and there’s a chance they might actually be corrupted\nWelsh Romani. But I once altered them to ADA ADA IO ADA ERIS, and I’ll be\ndarned if my next reading wasn’t clear as a bell. Give it a try yourself and\nsee what you think.\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## Conversational Chaos\n\nA friend and I once ended up in a very facetious online feud, which has pretty\nmuch refused to die, mainly because we both think it’s hysterical. The faux\nanimosity started organically: I was on a social media app mouthing off about\nwhatever aspect of modern occultism was bugging me at the moment, and, just\nfor grins, he commented on that post with melodramatic outrage, threatening to\nput a curse on me for my insolence.\n\nIn response, I told him that I’d just received an unexpected cash windfall, so\nif he’d like to curse me again, I could also use a new set of tires, please\nand thank you. He retorted with an invocation to the Old Ones, I countered\nwith the Turkey Curse, and our mutual acquaintances cheered in delight and\negged us both on. (Although there are a handful of people out there who never\nfigured out that the feud was not real and, to this day, fully believe we’re\nmortal enemies. The next time my friend and I meet in person, one of us is\ngoing to have to punch the other in the face just to keep up appearances.)\n\nA few months later, I started experimenting with using the forms of magic as\nlithomantic keywords, and to stress-test my theories, I hopped back online and\nasked if anyone had some sample questions I could try to answer.\n\nThe friend in question was one of the first to leave a comment: “Will our feud\never come to an end?” he queried.\n\n“Well, I certainly hope not,” I thought, but I went ahead and threw the stones\nanyway. The Indicator landed right next to Saturn, with the Sun and Mars\ncoupled directly beneath it.\n\nTranslated into their Chaos keywords and read together, the stones were\nproclaiming, “NO. EGO WAR.”\n\nI was already pretty sold on lithomancy before this experience, but the fact\nthat the stones wanted in on the joke endeared them to me forever.\n\n## Shufflemancy\n\nWhen I was in college, I used music to regulate my mood. I had a stack of\nfrenetically upbeat dance hits that I listened to when I wanted to cheer\nmyself up, as well as a mixtape of tear-jerking ballads that I would play\nwhenever I was feeling a little too happy and needed to simmer down a bit.\nThere were a couple of albums I only listened to when it was time to study,\nplus my friends could tell if I was having a good or bad day based on which\nact of the Rent original cast recording was blasting from my dorm.\n\nIf I’d have put all these songs together in one collection, I would have had\nan oracle.\n\nShufflemancy is an emerging form of divination that involves extracting\nanswers from music. It’s a new enough practice that there are no set rules,\nwhich makes it ideal as a tool for the Chaos Witch: You get to decide entirely\nhow to make it work best for you. The only thing you will need is an option to\nplay a random song on demand, without knowing which song it will be until you\nhear it.\n\nA good way to get going with shufflemancy is to put together a playlist,\nincluding at least twenty songs. You’ll want a variety of genres and artists\non your playlist, so that the answers you receive aren’t too generalized.\nYou’ll also want to make sure there’s an even mix of favorable and unfavorable\ntracks—there should be some songs that you love and represent yes to you, but\nothers that give a clear no, and at least one or two that you can’t stand.\n\nOnce your playlist is complete, think of a question, then put the list on\nshuffle and note the title of the first song that starts playing. Listen to\nthe song all the way through, paying close attention to the lyrics, and accept\nthe information that is presented to you.\n\nYou can add to or subtract from your playlist whenever you’d like. Just be\nsure to keep a solid balance of yes and no, favorable and unfavorable, happy\nand sad. And again, there are no rules to shufflemancy, but I would recommend\nkeeping this particular playlist set aside for divinatory purposes only. You\ndon’t want to get so used to hearing the songs on it that you miss anything\nimportant they’re trying to tell you.\n\nNow, if you don’t have the ability or resources to put playlists together, you\ncan still practice shufflemancy out in the wild. Sometimes, if I have a\ncertain question in mind, I’ll wait until I have to drive somewhere, then turn\non my car radio and interpret whatever song happens to be playing. I’ve also\nreceived shufflemantic messages via the music playing in a department store, a\nstore coincidentally being the location of the greatest example of\nshufflemancy I’ve ever witnessed.\n\nI was shopping for clothes one day, digging around and looking for deals, when\nanother customer a row over from me pulled a fetching but tight-looking shirt\noff the rack.\n\nHe turned to a nearby mirror and held the shirt up to his chest, and right\nthen, the song “Lose Control” by Teddy Swims began playing on the overhead.\n\nThe customer stopped and cocked his head, listening intently to the opening\nlyrics. “That’s a bad omen,” he said, to himself but out loud. And he put the\nshirt back on the rack and walked away.\n\nThere are omens and portents all around us. With some practice and a little\ndiscernment, you will be able to determine which ones are meant for you, and\nyou’ll have all the information you need to act accordingly.\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## Spreading the Love\n\nOnce you have a solid relationship with the oracle of your choice, you can\nstart experimenting with different layouts and configurations, eventually\ndevising your own to get tailored answers to any questions you have in mind.\nFollowing is a spread I came up with, based on the Discordian seasons, to use\nwith my Lenormand cards. See if it works for you, but also feel free to edit\nit, move the positions around, or make it the basis of a template no one has\never seen before.\n\n![](../Images/image-72TVVKGV.png)\n\nThe Discordian Seasons Layout\n\nHere are the steps to the spread as I use it:\n\nShuffle your deck at least five times.\n\nPull a card and lay it in front of you. This is the Chaos card, which\nrepresents the origin or backstory of the situation at hand.\n\nPull a second card and place it just below and to the right of the Chaos card.\nThis is the Discord card, which tells you what information about the situation\nis readily available. It also will warn of any potential conflicts.\n\nPull a third card and place it to the left of the Discord card. This is the\nConfusion card, which indicates what’s not being seen regarding the situation,\nor what is currently hidden.\n\nPull a fourth card and place it to the left of the Confusion card. This is the\nBureaucracy card, which indicates any obstacles that may be encountered, or\nany issues that will need to be dealt with before the querent can move\nforward.\n\nPull a fifth card and place it above and just to the right of the Bureaucracy\ncard. This is the Aftermath card, which reveals the resolution or final\noutcome.\n\nThis is a solid, workable method of Discordian divination, if I do say so\nmyself. But if you want to get even more Discordian with it, I have a bonus\nprocedure for you.\n\nClear your mind of any questions.\n\nYell, “Hey, Eris,” with as much force as you\n\ncan muster.\n\nThrow your oracle deck (or an Uno deck, or a Cards Against Humanity deck) into\nthe air.\n\nPick five random cards that have fallen facedown.\n\nFlip them over and read them in any order. Therein will lie the answer.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 12\n\n\n## Holydays\n\n## and Astrology\n\nReligious festivals offer respite from the toils of responsibility, along with\nno small amount of comfort. We know when they’re coming, which can be a\ntouchtone in an otherwise unpredictable world, and preparing for them often\ninvolves as much merriment as the celebrations themselves.\n\nThese special days can be solemn occasions as well, as those who observe look\nback on the year behind them or memorialize the people or things that are no\nlonger with them. And sometimes, they are just excuses to cut loose and\ncarouse, to act silly for no other reason than it is, at that moment, time to\nact silly.\n\nThe best festivals reflect all of that, and Discordianism provides a plethora.\nLet’s walk our way through them and see what we can learn—not only about the\nDiscordian worldview, but about ourselves.\n\n## A Decagon of Derangement\n\nEach Discordian season features a Holyday on its fifth and fiftieth day—the\nformer being the feast of the Discordian Apostle who governs the season, and\nthe latter acknowledging the season itself before the next season begins.\n\nThe Holydays, with their Discordian and corresponding Gregorian dates, are as\nfollows:\n\nMungday—Chaos 5 (January 5)\n\nChaoflux—Chaos 50 (February 19)\n\nMojoday—Discord 5 (March 19)\n\nDiscoflux—Discord 50 (May 3)\n\nSyaday—Confusion 5 (May 31)\n\nConfuflux—Confusion 50 (July 15)\n\nZaraday—Bureaucracy 5 (August 12)\n\nBureflux—Bureaucracy 50 (September 26)\n\nMaladay—Aftermath 5 (October 24)\n\nAfflux—Aftermath 50 (December 8)\n\nAlthough the Holydays are listed in the Principia Discordia, the book does not\nprovide any information on how to celebrate them, which is a challenge. But\nsince you’re practicing Chaos Witchcraft, and you’ve got the skills to\nconstruct your own belief systems, you can do with the Holydays whatever you’d\nlike—you’ll just want to stick to the spirit of each Apostle and season as you\nmove through the calendar.\n\nHere are my humble suggestions.\n\n## Mungday—The Fifth Day of Chaos (January 5)\n\nSince it’s the first Holyday of the year, Mungday is the right time to set\ngoals for the upcoming months. Use your favorite divination methods to glimpse\nwhat the year holds for you, and take some time to meditate on the Sacred\nChao, depicted on page 53, in which a pentagon represents rigid Order and a\ngolden apple represents flexible Disorder, and think about them in terms of\nproblems and solutions. What pentagons are currently in your way? What apples\ndo you have at your disposal?\n\nHung Mung is traditionally depicted laughing, slapping his knee (or buttocks)\nand declaring “I don’t know!” in response to anything asked of him, so Mungday\ncustoms may include laughing maniacally at inappropriate moments and\nritualistically stage-\n\nslapping oneself in Hung Mung’s honor. In the world of computing, mung is\njargon for making repeated changes to a file, resulting in unintentional but\nirreversible Destruction. If you’re handy with coding, or if you have a talent\nfor unwittingly downloading malware, you can celebrate Mungday by\n“accidentally” crashing computers, then calling your company’s IT department\nand yelling “I don’t know!” every time they ask you what happened.\n\nFun fact: The dwarf planet Eris was discovered on Mungday 2005, marking the\nofficial recognition of the physical presence of Our Lady of Discord in the\nuniverse.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Mungday\n\n“[I]n times of medieval magic, the pentagon was the generic symbol for\nwerewolves, but this reference is not particularly intended and it should be\nnoted that the Erisian Movement does not discriminate against werewolves—our\nmembership roster is open to persons of all races, national origins and\nhobbies.”—Principia Discordia, page 00051\n\n## Chaoflux—The 50th Day of Chaos (February 19)\n\nChaoflux is a day to make decisions, and to start taking action toward the\ngoals you set on Mungday: Blow cinnamon through your front door, as described\nin the introduction of this book. Or, if you’re feeling noncommittal, Chaoflux\noffers the chance to change your mind at the last minute and come up with\ndifferent goals entirely.\n\nThe Season of Chaos is coming to a close, which means Chaos itself will soon\ncongeal into organized form. Subtle signs of Discord are appearing, like the\nfirst blades of grass poking out of a snowbank … if, you know, the grass was\nkind of snippy and dyspeptic. Chaoflux is a lot like Imbolc—also known as\nCandlemas, the Gaelic fire festival marking the end of winter and the\nbeginning of spring—just without any fire hazards or inadvertent Catholicism.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Chaoflux\n\n“The Earthquakes and the heavens rattle; the beasts of nature flock together\nand the nations of men flock apart; volcanoes usher up heat while elsewhere\nwater becomes ice and melts; and then on other days it just rains. Indeed do\nmany things come to pass.”—Principia Discordia, page 00014\n\n## Mojoday—The Fifth Day of Discord (March 19)\n\nMojoday presents an opportunity to stretch your boundaries and step out of\nyour comfort zone. Dr. Van Van Mojo is sometimes said to dress in tweed suits\nand death masks, and to surround himself with a cloud of blue smoke, so feel\nfree to do the same—or at the very least, give yourself a temporary, radical\nmakeover, or go out in public wearing a cunning disguise. In keeping with the\nseason, your Mojoday celebration should also include a passionate,\ninappropriately timed argument over who should or should not be venerated.\n\nMeet up with a like-minded friend and lightly anoint yourselves with apple\njuice, then travel to a semipublic, Aneristic destination, like a bank lobby,\na waiting room, a commuter train station, the DMV, or Bingo Night. Flip a coin\nto determine which one of you is Team Van Van Mojo, and who is Team Patamunzo\nLingananda. Remember that some Discordians venerate Patamunzo Lingananda\ninstead of Dr. Mojo, as discussed in chapter 4. Immediately switch teams.\n\nStart squabbling, with arguments including obscure quotations from as many\nobscure Discordian works as possible (The Callipygian Grimoire, for example,\nor The Final Magnum Opiate of Alynaar the Shattered). Both parties should try\ntheir best to baffle the innocent bystanders around them before demanding that\nthey all pick sides.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Mojoday\n\n“Lord Omar claims that Dr. Mojo heaps hatred upon Patamunzo, who sends only\nLove Vibrations in return. But we of the POEE sect know that Patamunzo is the\nReal Imposter, and that those vibrations of his are actually an attempt to\nsubvert Dr. Mojo’s rightful apostilic authority by shaking him out of his\nwits.”—Principia Discordia, page 00039\n\n## Discoflux—The 50th Day of Discord (May 3)\n\nIf you put magical effort toward your annual goals, portents may begin to make\nthemselves known around Discoflux, so keep an eye out for signs that your\nmagic is working. And if those signs are not yet visible, or if they’re\nindecipherable, do not lose heart. Lust of result may start to feel like a\nviable option as the Season of Confusion begins creeping in—best to practice\nyour nonattachment, let your magic do its work, and enjoy the jubilee.\n\nAs for how the day should be commemorated, consensus suggests that the disco\nin Discoflux should be taken literally, and I cannot support this enough.\nBreak out your bell-bottoms, feather your hair, do the Hustle, watch Saturday\nNight Fever, use a mirror ball to tell fortunes. Live fully in the 1970s, if\nonly for twenty-four hours.\n\nI was once lucky enough to see Thelma Houston in concert, and right before she\nsang her 1976 dance hit “Don’t Leave Me This Way,” she told the audience that\nwhen she was nominated for a Grammy, she didn’t think she would win, so she\ndidn’t attend the award show. As such, she found out that she’d won Best\nFemale R&B Vocal Performance while she was scrubbing her kitchen floor.\n\n“The moral of this story,” Houston said, “is that if you ever get nominated\nfor a Grammy, you go.” Which is pretty motivating advice for Discoflux as\nwell.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Discoflux\n\n“Mal began to laugh. Omar began to jump up and down. Mal was hooting and\nhollering to beat all hell. And amid squeals of mirth and with tears on their\ncheeks, each appointed the other to be high priest of his own madness, and\ntogether they declared themselves to be a society of Discordia, for what ever\nthat may turn out to be.”—Principia Discordia, page 00010\n\n## Syaday—The Fifth Day of Confusion (May 31)\n\nSri Syadasti is the patron of all things psychedelic, so the first step in\ncelebrating Syaday is altering your consciousness in whatever manner you’re\ncomfortable with. Sobriety limits my options, so I usually follow Step\n11—“Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with\nGod[s] as we understand God[s]”—and just trance out under my own volition.⁸²\nAnd don’t forget that there are excitatory ways to achieve gnosis as well—see\nhow many jumping jacks you can do, in sets of fifty. Regardless of how you get\nthere, once you’re good and blurry, chant Syadasti’s full name five hundred\ntimes.\n\nIn honor of the season, though, you do need to make things confusing. Be sure\nto lose count while you’re chanting, or switch back and forth arbitrarily\nbetween English and Sanskrit. If you regularly utilize prayer beads while\nmeditating, hold them in your nondominant hand, or put them around your ankle\nand move the beads with your nondominant toes. Forget what you’re chanting;\nforget what you’re doing. Get distracted. Realize halfway through your\nmeditation that you don’t know where your keys are. Call an old friend and\nsuddenly remember to start chanting again. Forget to hang up.\n\nAs Eris once said, there is no tyranny in the State of Confusion, so be\negalitarian and bring as many people as you can along on your trip. Whether\nhe’s fictitious or St. Gulik or somewhere in between, Sri Syadasti will hold\nthe doors open for all of you.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Syaday\n\n“Tell constricted mankind that there are no rules, unless they choose to\ninvent rules. Keep close the words of Syadasti: ’Tis an ill wind that blows no\nminds. And remember that there is no tyranny in the State of Confusion. For\nfurther information, consult your pineal gland.”—Principia Discordia, page\n00009\n\n## Confuflux—The 50th Day of Confusion (July 15)\n\nConfuflux distinguishes itself from other Discordian Holydays by being the\nhardest to pronounce. And since it’s the halfway point of the year, it’s an\nappropriate time to take stock of your goals, and evaluate which ones you are\nactively accomplishing, and which ones may need some revision.\n\nMalaclypse the Younger once affirmed, “We Discordians must stick apart,”\nmeaning that we should revel in our differences and find unity in diversity,\nand that we don’t all have to do things the same way. This is something worth\nexploring on Confuflux: Interact with other Chaos Witches today and compare\nnotes. Discuss the compositions of your practices, trade tips, and draw\ninspiration from one another.\n\nWhen out and about on Confuflux, you can celebrate by sowing as much actual\nconfusion as possible, whether through your dress or confounding but harmless\nbehavior. Today is also a great day to get lost in your city of residence:\nHead off in a random direction, make random turns, and ignore the desperate\npleadings of your GPS until you end up in a part of town to which you’ve never\nbeen before. Locate a gas station or convenience store, ask for directions\nback to your neighborhood, and buy an outlandish hat.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Confuflux\n\n“Go ye hence and lift the Stash, that ye may come to own it and, owning it,\nshare it and, sharing it, love in it and, loving in it, dwell in it and,\ndwelling in the Stash, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings—an\nInspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.”—Principia Discordia, page\n00048\n\n## Zaraday—The Fifth Day of Bureaucracy (August 12)\n\nZarathud once lost an argument to a cow, and to commemorate that great moment\nin Discordian history, cut your losses and accept defeats today.⁸³ If one of\nyour goals is just not working out, let it go and focus on those that are\nstill in progress.\n\nAs the harbinger of the Season of Bureaucracy, Zaraday is not quite as\ncelebratory as the other Holydays—after all, Bureaucracy is established\nConfusion; the implementation of complex systems that continually break down\nand cause more problems. And that’s … not particularly enjoyable. As such, the\nbest way to observe Zaraday is to just tackle whatever tedious chores or\nresponsibilities you’ve been putting off and get them over and done with.\n\nFold the laundry, clean out your refrigerator, read your HOA deed\nrestrictions, go through your email and unsubscribe from all the spam, and\nupdate all your passwords. It won’t be fun, and it probably won’t even be that\nrewarding, but at least it will be finished. If anything, you can think of\nwhatever burden you overcome as an offering to Zarathud. And I will appreciate\nthat, even if he’s too caught up in debating livestock to notice.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Zaraday\n\n“The Pentabarf was discovered by the hermit Apostle Zarathud in the Fifth Year\nof The Caterpillar. He found them carved in gilded stone, while building a sun\ndeck for his cave, but their import was lost for they were written in a\nmysterious cypher. However, after ten weeks and eleven hours of intensive\nscrutiny he discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head\nand viewing it upside down.”—Principia Discordia, page 00004\n\n## Bureflux—The 50th Day of Bureaucracy (September 26)\n\nThe Curse of Greyface is most powerful during the Season of Bureaucracy, which\nis highlighted by paperwork and longer-than-\n\naverage hold times. But Bureflux brings a fleeting sense of optimism—we’ve\nonly got twenty-three days left until the next Discordian season, so all the\nred tape that Eris is currently using as aerial silk is almost behind us.\n\nTo put it succinctly, Bureflux is an Equinox and a retrograde rolled into one.\nAnd out of all the Holydays, Bureflux is the only one that exhausts me: I have\na tough time coming up with anything interesting to say about it. Which might\nactually be the point, now that I think about it.\n\nJust be nice to yourself today. Indulge in some self-care, avoid any shadow\nwork, and don’t check your DMs.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Bureflux\n\n“As a public service to all mankind and civilization in general, and to us in\nparticular, the Golden Apple Corps has concluded that planning such a\nPilgrimage [to the bowling alley where Eris first revealed herself] is\nsufficient and that it is prudent to never get around to actually\ngoing.”—Principia Discordia, page 00060\n\n## Maladay—The Fifth Day of Aftermath (October 24)\n\nDiscord leads to Confusion, which crystallizes into Bureaucracy, which in turn\ncreates an unsustainable system—eventually, it collapses into Aftermath, which\nis where we find ourselves today. But that’s a good thing, since Destruction\nalways leads to Creation: Every time Aneris takes something away, Eris creates\nsomething new to replace it.\n\nAnd since the Elder Malaclypse is such a fan of conspiracies, I think the\nperfect way to honor him on his special day is to create some new ones.\n\nAnother traditional (insofar as anything within Discordianism can be called\ntraditional) method of celebrating Maladay is to play the game Flip the Table,\nthe origins of which are allegedly attributed to the Elder Malaclypse himself.\nAny number of participants can play: All you need is two to twenty-three\nfriends and a table, preferably covered with symbols of Bureaucracy (overdue\nbills, user manuals, Windows 10, etc.).\n\nWith appropriate music in the background, players grab hold of the table and,\non cue, lift and toss, with the goal of causing the table to land in an\ninteresting, unexpected way. Players may also wish to scry in the patterns of\ndebris left over once the table and its contents hit the ground.\n\nFlip the Table can really be played at any time during the Season of\nAftermath, although protests and riots make the game more entertaining and\nmeaningful. Try throwing the table through a police barricade for extra\npoints, or attempt a variation in which whoever traps the most flat-earthers\nunder a table wins.\n\nReinvent the rules however you’d like, or just reinvent yourself. It’s\nAftermath, and there are pieces everywhere, so pick them up and put them\ntogether however you see fit. I wholeheartedly believe that the Elder\nMalaclypse will be wildly entertained by whatever you create.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Maladay\n\n“From that moment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of his\nsurroundings. He becomes free to play order games and change them at will. He\nbecomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it. He becomes free\nto play neither or both. And as the master of his own games, he plays without\nfear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in his\nsoul and love in his being.”—Principia Discordia, page 00081\n\n## Afflux—The 50th Day of Aftermath (December 8)\n\nAfflux is the closest thing Discordians have to a Winter Solstice. It marks\nthe close of the calendar year, which makes it a good time to reflect on the\nrelationship between Creation and Destruction, to examine the things that have\ncome undone around us, and to figure out what we can do with the pieces. Look\nback over any goals you may have jettisoned on Zaraday, determine why they\nfailed to launch, and figure out another angle toward achieving them.\n\nAfflux is a day of putting things back together. Solving jigsaw puzzles would\nbe a low-key way to celebrate the Holyday, as would baking, if you think about\nit in terms of taking a bunch of random, unrelated substances and welding them\ntogether into a tasty, unified whole.\n\nI am a terror in the kitchen, so personally, I stick to borrowing from Yom\nKippur—the Jewish day of atonement—by patching up any friendships that have\nfallen by the wayside. But if you can pull something out of the oven without\nsetting off a fire alarm, then knock yourself out, with my blessing.\n\nIf you have the materials on hand, kintsugi—the Japanese art of repairing\nbroken pottery with gold lacquer—would also be a meaningful way to commemorate\nAfflux. The philosophy behind kintsugi is that breakages are part of an\nobject’s story: By using gold to fix the cracks, the damaged item becomes more\nbeautiful for what it’s been through.\n\nAnd if you don’t have any broken crockery lying around, feel free to smash a\ncoffee mug or something, then glue it back together however you want. Build\nsomething entirely new out of it—turn it into an abstract sculpture, or a\nself-defense weapon, or even a ritual tool. Acknowledge how the breaks in your\nown past have made you stronger in the long run, and how they have allowed you\nto reinvent yourself.\n\nBeam that same intention into the ceramic shards in front of you. And use them\nto make something beautiful.\n\n## Gospel Reading for Afflux\n\n“During and after the Fall of the Establishment of Bureaucracy was the\nAftermath, an Age of Disorder in which calculation, computations, and\nreckonings were put away by the Children of Eris in Acceptance and Preparation\nfor the Return to Oblivion to be followed by a Repetition of the Universal\nAbsurdity. Moreover, of Itself the Coming of Aftermath waseth a Resurrection\nof the Freedom-flowing Chaos.”—Principia Discordia, page 00045\n\n## Discordian Dance Break\n\n## Chelseanacht\n\nOn July 17, 2007, members of the loose-knit occult organization that\neventually became known as the Domus Kaotica Marauder Underground performed an\nact of conjoint long-distance magic. The DKMU wanted to put the Chaos\n(specifically the Khaos, which they understood to be the source code of\nreality) back in Chaos Magic: On the night in question, four practitioners—one\nin Texas, one in California, one in Maryland, and one atop the Chelsea Hotel\nin New York City—worked together to create an “assault on reality.”⁸⁴ Their\nobjective was to shake things up, break open new magics, and jumpstart an\nepic, subconscious mass deconditioning.\n\nEvery July 17 since then, Chaotes collaborate with each other to honor the\nanniversary of the Chelsea Working. Chaos Witches tend to lean toward solitary\npractice, but Chelseanacht offers the opportunity to experiment with group\nwork. In the weeks leading up to July 17, organize through social media,\nsettle on a collective desire, synchronize your watches, and discover what\nkind of results a one-night-only coven can achieve.\n\n## Discordian Astrology\n\n## (or, Giving Birth to Dancing Stars)\n\nThere are several religious holidays that are inexorably linked to\nastronomical and astrological phenomena. In Wicca, for example, Yule is the\ncelebration of the return of the sun, since days start getting longer after\nthe Winter Solstice. And in Catholicism, the date of Easter changes every\nyear, because it is always held on the first Sunday after the first Full Moon\nafter the Spring Equinox, which the Church officially recognizes as March\n21.⁸⁵\n\nWith ten distinct Holydays of its own, it would be reasonable to assume that\nDiscordianism has some kind of connection to astrology, and in fact, page\n00063 of the Principia highlights the details of the official Discordian\nAstrological System. Here is that passage in its entirety:\n\nOn your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely\nmidnight, noting your birth time and date of observation, count all visible\nstars.\n\nWhen you have done this, write to me and I’ll tell you what to do next.\n\nLike so many other facets of Discordianism, the Astrological System is a punch\nline: It emphasizes the elaborate and often perplexing nature of traditional\nastrology before poking some fun at it. At the same time, Discordian astrology\ncould be a fascinating field of study—if anything, it could offer some insight\ninto why Chaos Witches are, well, the way we are.\n\nI have very thoughtfully invented it.\n\nJust as it is based on five seasons, the Discordian calendar sports five-day\nweeks, with each day of the week named after one of the five Elements. These\ndays are:\n\nSweetmorn\n\nBoomtime\n\nPungenday\n\nPrickle-Prickle\n\nSetting Orange\n\nThe Discordian calendar is static, and the days of the week do not shift from\nyear to year—for example, the fifteenth of May will always fall on Setting\nOrange, no matter what. This means that the first step in determining your\nDiscordian astrological sign is to figure out the day of the week on which you\nwere born. You can refer to the calendar in chapter 4. Once you know your day,\nyou will have the first half of your sign: your ruling Element.\n\nOnce you’ve got your day, look back at the calendar and note the season in\nwhich you were born. This season is the second half of your sign, which will\nalso tell you which Apostle of Eris is your patron. As a refresher, here are\nthe Apostles and their seasons:\n\nHung Mung, Patron of Chaos\n\nDr. Van Van Mojo, Patron of Discord\n\nSri Syadasti, Patron of Confusion\n\nZarathud, Patron of Bureaucracy\n\nThe Elder Malaclypse, Patron of Aftermath\n\nAnd this means that instead of the paltry twelve of the Zodiac, Discordianism\nis replete with twenty-five distinct astrological signs.\n\n## The Discordian Astrological Signs\n\nSweetmorn of Chaos\n\nSweetmorn of Discord\n\nSweetmorn of Confusion\n\nSweetmorn of Bureaucracy\n\nSweetmorn of Aftermath\n\nBoomtime of Chaos\n\nBoomtime of Discord\n\nBoomtime of Confusion\n\nBoomtime of Bureaucracy\n\nBoomtime of Aftermath\n\nPungenday of Chaos\n\nPungenday of Discord\n\nPungenday of Confusion\n\nPungenday of Bureaucracy\n\nPungenday of Aftermath\n\nPrickle-Prickle of Chaos\n\nPrickle-Prickle of Discord\n\nPrickle-Prickle of Confusion\n\nPrickle-Prickle of Bureaucracy\n\nPrickle-Prickle of Aftermath\n\nSetting Orange of Chaos\n\nSetting Orange of Discord\n\nSetting Orange of Confusion\n\nSetting Orange of Bureaucracy\n\nSetting Orange of Aftermath\n\nMy birthday is September 18, which, on the Discordian calendar, falls on the\n42nd day of Confusion. This tells me that my patron saint is Zarathud.\nAdditionally, Confusion 42 falls on Sweetmorn, making my ruling Element Sweet.\nErgo, my astrological sign is Sweetmorn of Bureaucracy.\n\nNow, at this point, you may be asking what the individual signs represent, or\nwhat personality traits they may characterize. And let me tell you: I have\nabsolutely no idea. This is Discordianism, after all, where things don’t have\nto have a reason for existing, other than for the sake of existing. We can\nchoose to interpret the astrological signs however we’d like, or choose not to\ninterpret them at all, and personally, I think that makes perfect sense.\n\nThen again, I’m a Sweetmorn of Bureaucracy. What else would you expect from\nme?\n\n## Crafting with Chaos\n\n## Unverified Personal Tib\n\nSt. Tib’s Day occurs once every four years and lands between Chaos 59 and 60\n(or, in Gregorian terms, on February 29—Leap Year). And, of course, The\nPrincipia offers a date for St. Tib’s Day, with no details on how to celebrate\nit, let alone any information on who St. Tib was or is.\n\nErgo, to follow up on Phil Hine’s mention of gods that didn’t exist five\nminutes ago, you are going to invent St. Tib.\n\nWe can associate St. Tib with fours, since that still aligns with the Law of\nFives (four being only one number away from five), and we can assume that Tib\nis a liminal figure, since Leap Year is kind of a time of no-time. But other\nthan that, what can we conclude about them? That, dear reader, is entirely up\nto you: You get to build a saint of your very own.\n\nHere are some things to ponder: What is Tib’s patronage? What symbols can be\nassociated with Tib? Is “Tib” short for anything? Or is it an acronym? What is\nTib’s gender? If they’re nonbinary, how do they define their gender identity?\nHow does Tib adorn themself? Do they dress ostentatiously, or are they a\nT-shirt and jeans kind of saint? What would be some appropriate offerings to\nTib? Since their feast day only occurs once every four years, when else should\nTib be venerated? What would daily devotion to St. Tib look like?\n\nOnce you have a perception of St. Tib in mind, craft a short prayer or\ninvocation to them. Cast a five-sided circle as described in chapter 4, call\nSt. Tib into the center of it, and commune with them for a bit. Keep a\nnotebook with you, and write down any impressions or messages you receive.\nThank Tib for their presence, and for their decision to exist, before you\nclose the circle.\n\nAs a sidenote and/or some inspiration for you: Late one evening, after hours\nof working feverishly on this manuscript, I fell asleep and had a dream in\nwhich there was a sixth Discordian Element called Snooze. If you’re in need of\na good jumping-off point for your St. Tib veneration, you’re more than welcome\nto steal the idea and associate Snooze with Tib.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n## Chapter 13\n\n\n## A Miscellany\n\n## of Misadventures\n\nIn looking back over my occult career, I can say with conviction that I’ve\nnever had a spell not work. I mean, sometimes they didn’t quite work as I\nexpected them to, and sometimes they worked far more explosively than\nanticipated, but every one of them had some kind of impact.\n\nA big part of those impacts was amassed knowledge: The discovery of a new\nskill, or a self-taught lesson on what to do or not do on the next go-round.\nIt’s those lessons that are most important to me, because the Witches around\nme can learn from them as well.\n\nEnglish novelist Catherin Aird once wrote, “If you can’t be a good example,\nyou’ll just have to be a horrible warning, that’s all.”⁸⁶ By sharing the\nexperiences I’ve had with Chaos Witchcraft so far, I get to be much more of\nthe former than the latter. And with that in mind, here are a few of my more\nmemorable exploits.\n\n## Of Blood and Sigils\n\nMy friend Chester’s primary love language is memes, so I always look forward\nto receiving kooky and amusing messages from him. Although it did throw me off\nwhen he texted one day to ask, “Are you familiar with giving injections in\nbutts?”\n\n“This … feels like a loaded question,” I replied.\n\n“Let me rephrase,” he texted back. “I’m due for a testosterone shot in the\nnext day or so, but I’m not feeling up to stabbing myself at the moment. Is\nthat something you could help with?”\n\n“Oh, okay,” I said. “It’s been a while, but sure, I can totally do it.”\n\n“That would be excellent, thanks. Doing it myself involves a large mirror and\ndisassociation.”\n\n“I worked at a veterinary clinic in high school. I’ve given a lot of canine\nbooster shots. I can’t imagine this being much different.”\n\nAnd it honestly wasn’t an unreasonable request. Between Gardnerian Wicca—a\npractice of which is ritual nudity—and my involvement with the local leather\ncommunity, I have, at one point or another, seen most of my friends in their\nbirthday suits, so what was one more bum in the grand scheme of things? Plus,\nI knew that Chester had an aversion to needles, so if administering his\ninjection for him would alleviate his stress, I was happy to do it.\n\nAnd if he started to panic, I figured I could just do what we did at the vet\nclinic, and grab him by the scruff of the neck and yell, “Bad dog, no biting,”\nuntil he settled down.\n\nWhich, coincidentally, is also sometimes how we handle things in the leather\ncommunity. You kind of have to pick your battles.\n\nI went over to Chester’s place, and we chitchatted for a while. And once he\nwas ready to take the plunge (so to speak), he shimmied out of his shorts and\nlay facedown on his bed.\n\n“Here’s the syringe,” he said.\n\n“Okay.”\n\n“And here’s an alcohol swab and a Band-Aid.”\n\n“Got it.”\n\n“And if there’s any blood, here’s a sigil I printed on tissue paper to absorb\nit.”\n\n“Copy that. Let’s do this.”\n\nAnd I jabbed him right in the candy cake.\n\nI watched the injection site for a few seconds, and then I yelled, “We have\nblood!” And Chester shouted, “Charge it up!” So I dabbed the sigil on the spot\nuntil it was good and crimson, and once the flow receded, I applied the Band-\nAid and handed Chester the sigil to do whatever else he needed to do with it.\n\nThis is one of the things I appreciate most about Chester as a Chaos Magician:\nWhen faced with an uncomfortable situation, he looks to see how he can\ntransmute it into something beneficial. In this case, it was, “I am afraid of\nneedles and hate the sight of blood. How can I use that?” And the fear and\nrepulsion became mercurial fuels for his occult operations.\n\nI don’t know the purpose of the sigil we charged with his blood, but I don’t\nneed to. What I also appreciate is that Chester trusted me to help him without\nasking unnecessary questions. And since I was able to give him the injection\nwithout causing him pain or discomfort, I’ve been able to help him out with\nsimilar workings every week since.\n\nA lot of frowns turned upside down here.\n\nWay back in 1997, former Chicago Tribune columnist Mary Schmich advised, “Do\none thing every day that scares you,” which is excellent advice in general,\nbut even more so for those of us frolicking about in the field of Chaos\nMagic.⁸⁷ And just like how Schmich’s “Wear Sunscreen” essay got reworked by\nBaz Luhrmann into a chart-topping hit single, we can utilize the theories of\nChaos Magic to turn pretty much anything into a magical operation.\n\n## The Teachable Moment\n\nCan a household chore become a spell? Can data entry be used for divination?\nCan ingesting a daily medication influence an unrelated spiritual condition or\nact as metaphysical protection? These are fun questions worth asking, and even\nif some of the possible answers strike us as kind of daunting, we won’t know\nuntil we try. So let’s try.\n\n## Intrusions Will Be Toad\n\nWhen I was seven years old, I turned on the sink in my bathroom to brush my\nteeth, unaware that a cockroach roughly the size of a Dodge Caravan was\nlurking in the basin. The roach went ballistic when hit by the stream of water\nand flung itself into the air, and I was officially traumatized for life.\n\n![](../Images/image-ATIHZGTG.jpg)\n\nLife-Size Rendition of a Texas Cockroach\n\nGargantuan roaches are just something you have to come to terms with when you\nlive in the South, even though their sheer size can be a challenge to\ncomprehend. The first time my sister-in-law (she’s from Kansas) saw one flying\n(they fly), she yelled, “Look! A bat!” But as an adult, I decided that I’d had\nenough of coexistence with eldritch horrors and turned to Witchcraft to deal\nwith the problem. Specifically, I created a servitor to keep roaches out of my\napartment. I named him Tygpan Chemdifork, and I am pleased to report that the\nworking was a success. Although getting him up to speed on his duties involved\na couple of false starts.\n\nThe day after Tygpan was begotten, I wandered into my bathroom to find a\nmidsize roach frantically squeezing itself into the millimeter of space\nbetween the vanity mirror and the wall. I was discouraged to see a roach at\nall, but I also remembered that part of Tygpan’s job was to shoo out any six-\nlegged varmints that had already snuck into the apartment. This one was\ndefinitely trying to escape from … something, so I gave Mr. Chemdifork the\nbenefit of the doubt and didn’t fuss about it.\n\nThe day after that, I came home from work and discovered a very big, very\nunalive roach lying on its back in the middle of my kitchen floor. There was a\nsubtle sense of pride in the air, similar to that exuded by a cat who’s just\nleft a dead mouse on a pillow, and I understood that Tygpan was trying to give\nme a little trophy to compensate for the previous day’s less-than-stellar\nhunt. So I spoke out loud and told him that I sincerely appreciated the gift,\nbut if he could leave the bodies out of sight from here on out, that would be\ngreat.\n\nOne more roach appeared in the bathroom about a week later, but this time it\nwas small and easy to eliminate on my own. I called out to Tygpan anyway and\nexplained that even though it was miniscule and easy to let slide under his\nradar, little roaches grow up to be big roaches, so we needed to make sure to\ntake care of those too.\n\nIt was at that moment, standing in front of my toilet and giving a “not angry,\njust disappointed” lecture to an invisible ball of Pungent and Boom, that I\nstarted to wonder if my grip on reality was really as firm as I’d always\nassumed. But it was also the last time I ever saw a roach around my abode.\n\nNow, there are toads.\n\nOn several occasions, I’ve come home to find a toad standing guard by my\ndoorstep. There is a toad nested under my porch, and toads patrolling the\nsidewalks of the complex. On one night in particular, I spied two roaches on\nthe bricks outside of my building, but I didn’t even twitch, on account of the\npredatory toad slowly creeping up behind them.\n\nIt’s almost as if Tygpan was a Pokémon who leveled up from imaginary to\namphibious.\n\nGranted, I have no proof that my servitor evolved into a knot of toads, and\ntoads themselves are not without annoyance. They are loud, for one thing:\nTheir creaky, high-pitched mating calls are relentless. But in the long run,\nI’d much rather lose sleep because a bunch of toads are feeling randy than\nbecause of the crippling fear that the roaches are coming. As long as he\ncontinues to chase them away, however Tygpan chooses to incarnate is perfectly\nfine with me.\n\n## The Teachable Moment\n\nSomething to think about when casting a spell is how you want the results to\nmaterialize. I don’t mind all the toads—toads are witchy and great—but if I\nhad to do it over, I would have put some limits on how far Tygpan could go to\nfulfill his insecticidal duties.\n\nThe toads undeniably solved my problem, but if any of my neighbors suffer from\nranidaphobia—the fear of frogs and toads—I may have caused some unintentional\nanxiety along with the roach-free relief.\n\n## Baphomet Man\n\nBy day, I manage an LGBTQ+ leather and fetishwear store, where I’ve got an\nemployee named Cuttle. Cuttle is a wonderful guy, a hard worker, and a very\ngenuine person—and because some of our customers have (to put it mildly)\nboundary issues, Cuttle’s sincerity sometimes gets misinterpreted.\n\nA customer started coming into the store every day to see Cuttle. Literally\nevery day. He would follow Cuttle around and compliment his tattoos, but he\nwasn’t really causing any problems, and Cuttle didn’t seem bothered, so I just\ndecided not to worry about it.\n\nAlthough he really did come in a lot, and he was really into Cuttle’s tattoos.\n\nOne morning, I showed up to open the store, and I found a plain white envelope\nslipped under the door. I figured it was an invitation to a neighborhood event\nor something, but when I opened it, I discovered that it was a typed letter to\nCuttle—it started out with a request to turn one of his tattoos into a T-shirt\ndesign, but then it just got kind of rambly, and it was signed, Baphomet Man.\n\nWhile I had no proof it was from that customer, it was … clearly from that\ncustomer. And here’s the thing: If your grammar is not stellar, and you’re\nidentifying as Baphomet, there is a fine line between “I want to turn your\ntattoo into a T-shirt design” and “I want to wear your skin.”\n\nCuttle was completely freaked out by the letter, but I was resolute in my\ndesire to keep him safe. “Listen,” I said. “I am not going to let anything bad\nhappen to you.” And I started doing protective work around the store with the\ngoal of keeping this guy away from Cuttle. I didn’t have much in the way of\nspell components to work with, but I did find some hand sanitizer and sidewalk\nchalk, both of which would get the job done.\n\nI sigilized my desire to keep Cuttle free from harm, and I used the chalk to\ndraw that sigil under the rainbow welcome mat in front of our door. And then I\nwent around the store, dabbing the hand sanitizer on any fixture Baphomet Man\nhad touched or leaned against, just to remove the essence of his presence.\nFinally, I fished around in the drawer under the cash register and pulled out\na little rubber ball that Baphomet Man had once left for Cuttle. I grabbed a\nblack marker, drew the sigil onto the ball, then slathered it in the sanitizer\n(I knew the alcohol in the sanitizer would smear the ink, but in my mind, that\nwas just a manifestation of Baphomet Man’s removal), went outside, and chucked\nit as hard as I could into the vacant lot behind us.\n\nThe one thing I didn’t have, and desperately needed, was a concrete reason to\nban the guy from the store. But I was confident in the magical work I’d done,\nso I figured everything else would just work itself out. And, most\nimportantly, Cuttle would be safe.\n\nCuttle and I both had the next day off, but I got a frantic call that morning\nfrom my employee on duty, who was weirded out to the point of near aphasia.\nApparently, Baphomet Man had come in looking for Cuttle, and when he was told\nthat Cuttle wasn’t working, he said, “Oh, I was just going to show him the new\ndrag routine I’ve been working on. Do you want to see it?”\n\n“I … I guess so?” my employee replied.\n\nAt which point Baphomet Man reached under his shirt, where he had concealed\ntwo water balloons, and popped them.\n\nTo clarify, he exploded water balloons in a store full of leather.\n\nMy employee had no idea how to react, so he reiterated that Cuttle wouldn’t be\ncoming in, waited for Baphomet Man to leave, and then cleaned up the mess. I\nwas on the phone with the store’s owners the following morning, explaining the\nsituation and telling them that Baphomet Man was not allowed back in the\nstore.\n\nAs soon as I said it, Baphomet Man walked through the door.\n\n“Is Cuttle here?” he asked.\n\n“Did you pop water balloons in my store?” I asked in return.\n\n“Oh, they said I could,” he replied.\n\n“In fact, ‘they’ did not,” I shot back. “That was an act of vandalism.”\n\nHe started to argue, but I cut him off and was like, “Nope. Get out.”\n\n“Well, thank you for being polite about this,” he said. And he left.\n\nI called the owners back to fill them in on the latest development, and they\ncalled the manager of the bar with which we share a building, just to let him\nknow about Baphomet Man as well. To which the manager responded, “What a\ncoincidence! We just banned him from our establishment, for completely\nunrelated reasons.”\n\nAnd none of us ever saw him again. But I do appreciate that in doing work to\nprotect Cuttle, I was granted a solid reason to keep Baphomet Man away from\nall of us.\n\n## The Teachable Moment\n\nThis is just how Chaos Witchcraft seems to operate at times. The results of\nyour spells may not be quite what you’d foretold when you cast them, but you\nwill get results nonetheless.\n\n## Welcome to the Ellis,\n\n## Said the Spider to the Witch\n\nTuesdays are traditionally slow in retail, so I spent the morning reading\nabout the history of the Domus Khaotica Marauder Underground. I was intrigued\nby some of the capers they’d pulled off—specifically, one in which a couple of\nearly members designed a sigil to link areas of magical power together,\ncreating a web that any practitioner could theoretically access to boost their\nown workings.\n\n![](../Images/image-3E294YJV.png)\n\nThe Linking Sigil\n\nThe DKMU writings suggested that the Linking Sigil, or Ellis (LS), could be\nplaced at any location significant for its sanctity, metaphysical resonance,\nor liminality. In my mind, a minority-owned business catering to a subculture\nwithin a subculture is pretty darn liminal, so I figured that plugging the\nstore into the Ellis network would definitely be keeping in line with the\nsigil’s intent.\n\nInspired, I ran outside to draw the Ellis in silver Sharpie upon a large\npebble next to the store’s front stoop. And as they say, bad decisions make\ngreat stories—as such, I was completely at peace with everything that happened\nnext.\n\n## Day 1\n\nCustomers started trickling in about ten minutes after I inscribed the sigil,\nand they spent a surprising amount of money, as did the customers who came in\nafter them. By the time a coworker showed up to relieve me, we’d beaten all\nsales for previous Tuesdays and were well on our way to setting a weekday\nrecord.\n\nI was working a split shift and ended up with a couple of hours to kill, so I\nmessaged Chester to see what he was doing. “I’m just hanging out at my place,”\nhe replied. “Want to come by and let me zap you with a New Age gadget to\ndecalcify your pineal gland?”\n\nTwo hours later, freshly ascended, I went back to the store, where I found my\nvery bored coworker waiting for me.\n\n“It’s been dead since you left,” he said. “Literally no one has come in.”\n\nAs soon as those words left his mouth, the door flew open, and a customer\nbounded in.\n\n“Hello!” he exclaimed. “I have never been here before and aim to do some\nshopping!” The whole thing was eerily similar to that scene in Little Shop of\nHorrors, where some guy who may or may not be an alien can’t help noticing\nthat strange and interesting plant in the flower shop window and then buys one\nhundred dollars’ worth of roses. And I myself couldn’t help noticing that\nsales for the day seemed directly tied to my presence.\n\n## Day 2\n\nMy boss asked me to come in an hour early, which put me comfortably into\novertime. The first customer of the day seemed very polite, but every time my\nboss left the room, he aggressively hit on me: It was very Doctor Jekyll and\nDaddy Hyde. He eventually made some purchases and left, right as the phone\nrang. The caller explained that a friend had sent him some … playthings, and\nhe wasn’t sure how to use them. Could I talk him through that in explicit\ndetail?\n\nRaising my voice slightly so as to drown out his heavy breathing, I told him\nthat I unfortunately could not be of assistance and ended the call. Perfect\ntiming, as it turned out, because customers were piling in, and a disquieting\nnumber of them took unusual interest in me. But it was also another day of\nunderestimated profit, so I called it even.\n\n## Day 3\n\n“Would you be willing to choke me? It helps with my PTSD.”\n\nThe customer understood when I declined, and he bought a bunch of stuff\nanyway. But it was pretty much a representative sample of all the interactions\nthroughout my shift. Sales were once again brisk, although my tolerance for\nboundary issues was beginning to wear thin.\n\nWhat finally did me in, though, was the spider hiding in the upper reaches of\nour covered porch, who waited patiently until I stepped out front to get some\nair, then gleefully repelled down from the rafters a few inches from my face.\n\nI’m pretty sure there were no witnesses, so I can say with a straight face\nthat I did not scream like a twelve-year-old at a Taylor Swift concert. And\napparently, a lot of practitioners who’ve scratched the surface of the Linking\nSigil have sensed or actually met an intelligence within its connected matrix.\nSome have described this presence as a middle-aged, red-haired woman\nidentified as Ellis herself (who may or may not also be Eris), while others\nreport brushes with a character resembling the protagonist from Alice in\nWonderland. And some just say it’s a big spider.\n\nI live in Texas. We have spiders. And I refuse to ascribe spiritual import to\nany and every chance encounter with wildlife. But I will say that after\nseventy-two hours of gainful strangeness, getting ambushed by what may or may\nnot have been Ellis herself was enough to make me bring the experiment to a\nclose.\n\nHaving gleaned some insight into the sigil and its capabilities, I ritually\nsevered my link to the network. And by that, I mean I ritually took the pebble\nout to the parking lot and ritually demolished it with a hammer.\n\nAccording to the DKMU, drawing the Ellis without any purpose behind it will\nbring chaos (not the good kind), whereas drawing the sigil with a specific\ngoal in mind will trigger successful but unexpected results. Considering the\nevents of those three days, I can confirm this with aplomb. And I do plan on\nworking more with Ellis, just in an environment with fewer variables.\n\nSales dipped mildly after I smashed the pebble, but my customers went back to\nbeing pleasant and emotionally distant. I took both as strong signs that any\nother ingenious, work-related woo I devise should be placed directly on the\nnon-sentient register.\n\n## The Teachable Moment\n\nIf I’d done a little more research on the Linking Sigil, I would have\nexercised more caution before doodling it on rocks. Don’t be afraid to\nexperiment, but do make sure you have all the information you need before\nfumbling around and finding out. Creepy customers may not always be worth the\nmagical outcome.\n\n## Cassandra Pleads the Fifth\n\nA metaphysical shop not too far from me hosts a Psychic Sunday event twice a\nmonth, and I’m on their rotating roster of prognosticators. So, once every six\nweeks or so, I get to spend my afternoon hanging out in a cozy, magical space\nand offering lithomantic readings to the general public.\n\nIt’s a rewarding experience overall, although I do seem to attract more than\nmy fair share of what I’ve come to call jump scare clients. These are people\nwho have specific questions in mind, but they’re not willing to lead with\nthem. Instead, they test the waters, making sure they’re comfortable with me\nand what I have to say. They pitch a few innocuous queries and give me a false\nsense of security, then pull a 180 and shank me with the heavy stuff.\n\n“I just want a general reading,” they say, “Maybe about … oh, I don’t know,\nlove? Or money?” And then, fifteen minutes later, they’re leaning over the\ntable between us like, “How much prison time am I looking at, exactly?” and\nthe tarot reader in the booth next to mine stops shuffling.\n\nI’ve learned to operate under the assumption that any client could be a\npotential jump scare, although every once in a while, one of them manages to\ncatch me off guard. Like a particular gentleman for whom I’ve read several\ntimes, who normally only comes in with questions about his various business\nventures. He turned up one Sunday with standard inquiries in tow, but after\nwe’d covered the usual fare (do invest in futures; do not sell the truck), he\npalmed a curveball out of nowhere and winged it at me.\n\n“So … I have this friend,” he said. “She’s currently in the hospital, and she\nwon’t tell me what’s going on, but I’m worried about her, and I just want to\nknow if she’s okay.”\n\nIt was a fair, unintrusive question, albeit an unexpected divergence from his\nnormal requests. But it also would only require a simple yes or no, so I\ngathered up my stones and gave them a toss, watching as one of them hit the\ncasting cloth at a funny angle and bounced right out of the circle.\n\nI didn’t realize I was staring at the stone until several awkward seconds\nlater, when the client cleared his throat and asked, “Does that … does that\nmean anything?”\n\n“If a stone lands outside of the circle, it’s irrelevant to the reading,” I\nexplained, composing myself. And that is almost always true—except sometimes,\nwhen a stone deliberately removes itself, it has a story all its own to\nrelate. In this case, I suddenly had insight into why his friend went to the\nhospital, and what she had done, and why she wasn’t talking to him about it.\nIt was like the stone was a Pokémon ball, but instead of a charming little\nmonster, some random stranger’s medical history popped out.\n\nIt was a lot of information that he hadn’t asked for, and that I wasn’t\ncomfortable holding. But because he didn’t ask, there was no reason for me to\npoint any of it out to him. Instead, I dragged my eyes over the rest of the\nreading. Death next to Pungent and Thinking, Wealth near Prickle and Boom: No,\nshe would not be talking about it, but yes, she would indeed be okay.\n\nWhen it comes to lithomancy, I’m right more often than I’m wrong, and I trust\nmy ability to interpret what the stones are trying to say. But sometimes, when\nmore pistons are firing than can feasibly fit in my engine, my gears\ninevitably shift toward, “You know, this is just a disorderly scattering of\nrocks. They mean nothing. There is no logic behind this. Do not believe\nanything that comes out of my mouth.” There is an upside, though, to getting\nbludgeoned by a lithomantic info dump, in that it tells me there’s more going\non than the client is sharing. Which in turn gives me tools to direct the rest\nof the reading.\n\n## The Teachable Moment\n\nWhen divining for other people, do your best to stick with clear yes-no\nanswers, and don’t wander too far off course. In turn, the person for whom you\nare reading won’t be encouraged to ask about things they don’t really want or\nneed to know. And that lets both of you off the hook.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n“The Parable of Steve” is not part of the Principia Discordia—rather, it\nappeared in the later anthology Et Cetera Discordia—but it has become a\nbeloved piece of Discordian lore.\n\nFollowing is my attempt at retelling it.\n\nOne afternoon, this guy named Steve was browsing at his local independent\nbookstore, when he came across a copy of the Principia Discordia. He flipped\nthrough a few pages and was like, “This is it. This is the answer! I’m\nrebellious, and anti-authority, and I have a great sense of humor, and I\nappreciate the absurd: I am … Discordian.”\n\nAnd he set off to find other Discordians.\n\nHe also renamed himself Pope Buttercup the 23rd.\n\nEventually, Steve learned that a local Discordian society met monthly at a\nnearby coffee shop, so on the day of the meetup, he charged into the venue,\nready to be embraced by his tribe. But the place was empty, except for a group\nof people in a booth in the back corner. And these were, like, nondescript,\neveryday people—one of them was wearing a business suit, and another looked\nlike she could be somebody’s grandma.\n\nBut they were aggressively arguing with each other, so Steve was like, “Hmm.\nThese are probably the Discordians.” He marched up to the table and loudly\nannounced, “Twenty-three pineal fnord! I am Pope Buttercup the 23rd! I am\nrandom! I say random things! And I am a Discordian like you!”⁸⁸\n\nAnd everyone at the table looked at him for a second, and then they went back\nto arguing.\n\nSo Steve tried again.\n\n“Pardon me,” he said, toning it down a little this time. “But could you tell\nme where the monkeys fly at midnight? Modern politics bore me, and I can\nswallow my own nose!”\n\nAt this point, Steve realized that a few of the people at the table had\nstarted making fun of him. Like, they were pointing at him, and whispering to\neach other and laughing.\n\nAnd this infuriated Steve. He was like, “Hey! I’m the real Discordian here!\nYou’re just like everyone else! You’re supposed to be different. You should be\npaying attention to me, and listening to me, so that I can teach you how to be\nDiscordian!”\n\nTo prove his point, Steve started dancing around and yelling the most absurd\nthings he could think of while squawking like a chicken.\n\n“I am the paulrus,” he shouted. “Together we turntable the green otter! Buck-\nbawk!”\n\nAnd the table erupted. One third of the group started yelling back at Steve\nand telling him to leave them alone; a second third of the group started\nyelling at the first third, telling them to shut up and leave Steve alone; and\nthe third third just kept trying to keep their original conversation going,\nbut they couldn’t hear each other over all the commotion.\n\nFinally, a barista stormed over to the table and was like, “What the actual\nhell is going on over here?!”\n\nEveryone stopped yelling. And then, the quietest member of the group looked up\nat the barista and whispered, “Discord.”\n\nThe overarching message is that there is no One True Way to practice\nDiscordianism, just like there’s no One True Way to practice Chaos\nWitchcraft—trying to cram it into a unified box is just applying Destructive\nOrder to Creative Disorder, which inevitably results in Destructive Disorder.\nInstead, our unity comes from our differences, and the celebration of those\ndifferences. As Mal-2 once said, “We Discordians must stick apart.”\n\nThere is no right way to be a Chaos Witch, and there never will be. There’s\nonly your way.\n\n## A Decade of Discord\n\nPer the Discordian calendar, Et Cetera Discordia was published in 3175, fifty\nyears after the first publication of the Principia Discordia, whereas the\nmajority of The Chaos Apple was written in 3189. However, according to the\nGregorian calendar, the year was 2023, and since twenty-three is a sacred\nDiscordian number, the next decade officially belongs to Eris—her reign will\nend on December 31, 2032.\n\nAnd honestly, Gregorians have no one but themselves to blame for that. Quoth\nthe grand folks over at PrincipiaDiscordia\n\n.com on the matter, “Buckle up.”\n\nAs with almost everything else within Discordianism, we aren’t even teased\nwith a hint as to what we’re supposed to do with this information, or how we\nmight prepare for a decade of Erisian mischief. I feel like it’s safe(?) to\nsay that the Discordian seasons will be more pronounced, with Chaos, Discord,\nConfusion, Bureaucracy, and Aftermath all living up to their names. So that’s\ndefinitely something against which to gird your loins.\n\nAlthough speaking of names: In honor of the Era of Eris, 2023 was the year I\nadded Horkos to my already way-too-long nom de plume.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Horkos is the Greek personification of curses against\nthose who break oaths. He’s also the only child of Eris who’s not an\nunrepentant savage, so incorporating His name into my own (probably) won’t\nbring unnecessary horrors into my life. Additionally, this gives me five names\ninstead of four—Thumper Marjorie Splitfoot Forge—with a grand total of ten\nsyllables. Plus hork is one of the funniest words in the English language, so\nyeah. Discordian as all get-out.\n\nBut most importantly, in a Discordian worldview, the one most likely to break\noaths is Greyface, so it is against him that Horkos rages. And since, as Chaos\nWitches, it is up to us to throw as many Turkey Curses as we can at Greyface\nand his Aneristic retinue, we are all Horkos as well.\n\nGranted, making my name even harder to fit on my debit card won’t save me or\nanyone else from a one-hundred-twenty-month onslaught of Disorder. We’re going\nto have to pick our battles as we wade through bimodalities of weirdness,\nfocusing as much as we can on the Creative instead of granting power to the\nDestructive.\n\n## Once Upon an Apple\n\nHere’s another parable on this very subject—a fable by Aesop this time—with a\nmoral worth minding as we stumble forward for the next ten years and beyond.\n\nMany moons ago, in the romantic utopia that is mythological Greece, Heracles\nwas wandering down a narrow road when he spotted an apple in his path. Miffed\nby the tiny obstacle, he attempted to smash it with his heel, on account of …\nhe had an allergy? Hated carbs? Aesop wasn’t clear on this part.\n\nAnyway, Heracles stomped on the apple, and it promptly inflated to twice its\nsize. He stomped on it repeatedly, but it just kept growing larger. Finally,\nhe tried hitting it with his club, at which point the apple expanded so\nmassively that it completely blocked his path.\n\nHeracles was standing there, glaring helplessly at this kaiju of a fruit, when\nAthena suddenly appeared next to him.\n\n“What’s up?” she asked.\n\nFully enraged by then, Heracles just gestured violently at the gargantuan\napple and did that mouth-flapping thing that happens when you’re too angry to\nform coherent words.\n\n“Ah, I see,” said Athena, translating. “That right there is the Apple of\nDiscord. Ask me how I know. If you don’t mess with it, it stays small; but if\nyou try to fight it, it swells into something unmanageable.”\n\n“Like a sebaceous cyst?” Heracles asked.\n\n“I mean … sure, okay,” Athena replied, recalling why she avoided cameos in his\nmyths. “Exactly like that. But if you’ll excuse me, I gotta be somewhere else.\nLike, immediately. Goddess of wisdom stuff.”\n\nDestructive Order begets Destructive Disorder, and the angrier we get about\nnot being able to control, say, inevitable inconveniences, or arguments on the\ninternet, the more uncontrollable those things become. Better to let sleeping\napples lie in the road and direct our attention to the issues that are within\nour capacity to manage. Like how we react to those obstacles when we encounter\nthem.\n\nPage 00074 of the Principia Discordia offers a similar, if slightly more\ndifferently sane, take on the situation:\n\nThe human race will begin solving its problems on the day that it ceases\ntaking itself so seriously.\n\nIf you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master\nsense, then each will expose the other for what it is: absurdity. From that\nmoment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of his\nsurroundings. He becomes free to play order games and change them at will. He\nbecomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it. He becomes free\nto play neither or both. And as the master of his own games, he plays without\nfear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in his\nsoul and love in his being.\n\nNo matter what inanities get thrown at us, we will undoubtedly thrive and\nsurvive, provided we keep in mind that humor is just as important as\nseriousness, and that laughter transcends all other emotions. The more fun we\ncan have, the more empowered we’ll be—after all, the winner is always the one\nwho laughs last.\n\nHappy Decade of Our Lady Discordia, my fellow Clown Witches and Chaotes. Go\noff and joyously partake of a hotdog. You’ve earned it.\n\n[[contents]](chapter0004.html)\n\n![apple](../Images/image-SHX9OAUS.png)\n\n\n## Chaos Continued\n\nI’ve mentioned quite a number of books throughout The Chaos Apple, most\nnotably Liber Null & Psychonaut by Peter J. Carroll, Condensed Chaos by Phil\nHine, and of course the Principia Discordia. But there are thousands of\nmanuals, grimoires, and fictional works out there that can guide you as you\ncome into your own as a Chaos Witch.\n\nFollowing are a variety of resources that were incredibly helpful to me on my\nown Chaos Witchcraft journey, categorized by subject.
