I shall write a reply, we publish the whole thing and \nI promise you - we shall have lots of fun.' I liked the suggestion and \nstarted working. The manuscript of my part of the book was fmished \nin 1972 and I sent it to London. There it disappeared under rather \nmysterious circumstances. lmre Lakatos, who loved dramatic \ngestures, notified Interpol and, indeed, Interpol found my manu­\nscript and returned it to me. I reread it and made some fmal changes. \nIn February 1974, only a few weeks after I had finished my revision, I \nwas informed of lmre's death. I published my part of our common \nenterprise without his response. A year later I published a second \nvolume, Science in a Free Society, containing additional material and \nreplies to criticism. \nThis history explains the form of the book. It is not a systematic \ntreatise; it is a letter to a friend and addresses his idiosyncrasies. For \nexample, Imre Lakatos was a rationalist, hence rationalism plays a \nlarge role in the book. He also admired Popper and therefore Popper \noccurs much more frequently than his 'objective importance' would \nwarrant. lmre Lakatos, somewhat jokingly, called me an anarchist \nand I had no objection to putting on the anarchist's mask. Finally, \nlmre Lakatos loved to embarrass serious opponents with jokes and \nirony and so I, too, occasionally wrote in a rather ironical vein. An \nexample is the end of Chapter 1: 'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I \nhold - I do not think that 'principles' can be used and fruitfully \ndiscussed outside the concrete research situation they are supposed \nto affect - but the terrified exclamation of a rationalist who takes a \ncloser look at history. Reading the many thorough, serious, \nlongwinded and thoroughly misguided criticisms I received after \npublication of the first English edition I often recalled my exchanges \nwith lmre; how we would both have laughed had we been able to read \nthese effusions together. \nThe new edition merges parts ofAgainstMethodwith excerpts from \nScience in a Free Society.

Again I want to make two points: first, that science can \nstand on its own feet and does not need any help from rationalists, \nsecular humanists, Marxists and similar religious movements; and, \nsecondly, that non-scientific cultures, procedures and assumptions \ncan also stand on their own feet and should be allowed to do so, if this \nis the wish of their representatives. Science must be protected from \nideologies; and societies, especially democratic societies, must be \nprotected from science. This does not mean that scientists cannot \nprofit from a philosophical education and that humanity has not and \nnever will profit from the sciences. However, the profits should not \nbe imposed; they should be examined and freely accepted by the \nparties of the exchange. In a democracy scientific institutions, \nresearch programmes, and suggestions must therefore be subjected \nto public control, there must be a separation of state and science just \nas there is a separation between state and religious institutions, and \nscience should be taught as one view among many and not as the one \nand only road to truth and reality. There is nothing in the nature of \nscience that excludes such institutional arrangements or shows that \nthey are liable to lead to disaster. \nNone of the ideas that underlie my argument is new. My \ninterpretation of scientific knowledge, for example, was a triviality for \nphysicists like Mach, Boltzmann, Einstein and Bohr. But the ideas of \nthese great thinkers were distorted beyond recognition by the rodents \nof neopositivism and the competing rodents of the church of 'critical' \nrationalism. Lakatos was, after Kuhn, one of the few thinkers who \nnoticed the discrepancy and tried to eliminate it by means of a \ncomplex and very interesting theory of rationality. I don't think he has \nsucceeded in this. But the attempt was worth the effort; it has led to \ninteresting results in the history of science and to new insights into \nthe limits of reason. I therefore dedicate also this second, already \nmuch more lonely version of our common work to his memory. \nEarlier material relating to the problems in this book is now \ncollected in my Philosophical Papers} Farewell to Reason2 contains \nhistorical material, especially from the early history of rationalism in \nthe West and applications to the problems of today. \nI. 2 vols, Cambridge, 1 981. \n2.

    "chunk_full": "Preface to the Third Edition \nMany things have happened since I first published Against Method \n(AM for short). There have been dramatic political, social and \necological changes. Freedom has increased - but it has brought \nhunger, insecurity, nationalistic tensions, wars and straightforward \nmurder. World leaders have met to deal with the deterioration of our \nresources; as is their habit, they have made speeches and signed \nagreements. The agreements are far from satisfactory; some of them \nare a sham. However, at least verbally, the environment has become a \nworld-wide concern. Physicians, developmental agents, priests \nworking with the poor and disadvantaged have realized that these \npeople know more about their condition than a belief in the universal \nexcellence of science or organized religion had assumed and they \nhave changed their actions and their ideas accordingly (liberation \ntheology; primary environmental care, etc.). Many intellectuals have \nadapted what they have learned at universities and special schools to \nmake their knowledge more efficient and more humane. \nOn a more academic level historians (of science, of culture) have \nstarted approaching the past in its own terms. Already in 1933, in his \ninaugural lecture at the College de France, Lucien Febvre had \nridiculed writers who, 'sitting at their desks, behind mountains of \npaper, having closed and covered their windows', made profound \njudgements about the life of landholders, peasants and farmhands. In \na narrow field historians of science tried to reconstruct the distant \nand the more immediate past without distorting it by modem beliefs \nabout truth (fact) and rationality. Philosophers then concluded that \nthe various forms of rationalism that had offered their services had \nnot only produced chimaeras but would have damaged the sciences \nhad they been adopted as guides. Here Kuhn's masterpiece played a \ndecisive role. 1 It led to new ideas. Unfortunately it also encouraged \nlots of trash. Kuhn's main terms ('paradigm', 'revolution', 'normal \n1 .

That trend lasted well into the early \nseventies. By contrast there are now historians and sociologists who \nconcentrate on particulars and allow generalities only to the extent \nthat they are supported by sociohistorical connections. 'Nature', says \nBruno Latour, referring to 'science in the making' is 'the \nconsequence of [a] settlement' of 'controversies'.2 Or, as I wrote in \nthe first edition of AM: 'Creation of a thing, and creation plus full \nunderstanding of a correa idea of the thing, are very often parts of one \nand the same indivisible process and cannot be separated without \nbringing the process to a stop.'3 \nExamples of the new approach are Andrew Pickering, Construaing \nQuarks, Peter Galison, How Experiments End, Martin Rudwick, The \nGreat Devonian Controversy, Arthur Fine, The Shaky Game and \nothers. 4 There are studies of the various traditions (religious, \nstylistic, (!atronage, etc.) that influenced scientists and shaped their \nresearch;5 they show the need for a far more complex account of \nscientific knowledge than that which had emerged from positivism \nand similar philosophies. On a more general level we have the older \nwork of Michal Polanyi and then Putnam, van Fraassen, Cartwright, \nMarcello Pera6 and, yes, lmre Lakatos, who was sufficiently \noptimistic to believe that history herself - a lady he took very seriously \n- offered simple rules of theory evaluation. \nIn sociology the attention to detail has led to a situation where the \nproblem is no longer why and how 'science' changes but how it keeps \ntogether. Philosophers, philosophers of biology especially, suspected \nfor some time that there is not one entity 'science' with clearly \ndefined principles but that science contains a great variety of (high­\nlevel theoretical, phenomenological, experimental) approaches and \nthat even a particular science such as physics is but a scattered \ncollection of subjects (elasticity, hydrodynamics, rheology, thermo­\ndynamics, etc., etc.) each one containing contrary tendencies \n(example: Prandtl vs Helmholtz, Kelvin, Lamb, Rayleigh; Truesdell \n2.

For some authors this is not only a \nfact; it is also desirable.7 Here again I contributed, in a small way, in \nChapters 3, 4 and 11 of AM, 8 in section 6 of my contribution to \nLakatos and Musgrave's Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge \n(criticism of the uniformity of paradigms in Kuhn)9 and already in \n1962, in my contribution to the Delaware Studies for the Philosophy of \nScience.10 \nUnity further disappears when we pay attention not only to breaks \non the theoretical level, but to experiment and, especially, to modem \nlaboratory science. As Ian Hacking has shown in his pathbreaking \nessay Representing and /ntervenin411 and as emerges from Pickering's \nScience as Practice and Culture, 2 terms such as 'experiment' and \n'observation' cover complex processes containing many strands. \n'Facts' come from negotiations between different parties and the \nfinal product - the published report - is influenced by physical \nevents, dataprocessors, compromises, exhaustion, lack of money, \nnational pride and so on. Some microstudies of laboratory science \nresemble the 'New Journalism' of jimmy Breslin, Guy Talese, Tom \nWolfe and others; researchers no longer sit back and read the papers \nin a certain field; they are not content with silent visits to laboratories \neither- they walk right in, engage scientists in conversation and make \nthings happen (Kuhn and his collaborators started the procedure in \ntheir interviews for the history of quantum mechanics). At any rate -\nwe are a long way from the old (Platonic) idea of science as a system of \nstatements growing with experiment and observation and kept in \norder by lasting rational standards. \nAM is still partly proposition oriented; however, I also had my \nsane moments.

My discussion of the many events that constitute \nwhat is being observed15 and especially my discussion of Galileo's \ntelescopic discoveries16 agree with the requirements of the new \nlaboratory sociology except that Galileo's 'laboratory' was rather \nsmall by comparison. This case shows, incidentally, that like the \nolder philosophies of science the new microsociology is not a \nuniversal account but a description of prominent aspects of a special \nperiod. It does not matter. A universal description of science at any \nrate can at most offer a list of events. 17 It was different in antiquity. \nIt is clear that the new situation requires a new philosophy and, \nabove all, new terms. Yet some of the foremost researchers in the \narea are still asking themselves whether a particular piece of research \nproduces a 'discovery', or an invention', or to what extent a \n(temporary) result is 'objective'. The problem arose in quantum \nmechanics; it is also a problem for classical science. Shall we \ncontinue using outmoded terms to describe novel insight or would it \nnot be better to start using a new language? And wouldn't poets and \njournalists be of great help in finding such a language? \nSecondly, the new situation again raises the question of 'science' \nvs democracy. For me this was the most important question. 'My \nmain reason for writing the book', I say in the Introduction to the \nChinese Edition, 18 'was humanitarian, not intellectual. I wanted to \nsupport people, not to \"advance knowledge.\"' Now if science is no \nlonger a unit, if different parts of it proceed in radically different ways \nand if connections between these ways are tied to particular research \nepisodes, then scientific projects have to be taken individually. This \nis what government agencies started doing some time ago. In the late \nsixties 'the idea of a comprehensive science policy was gradually \nabandoned. It was realized that science was not one but many \nenterprises and that there could be no single policy for the support of \nall of them.19 Government agencies no longer finance 'science', they \nfinance particular projects.

Are the new philosophers and sociologists prepared to \nconsider this consequence of their research? \nThere have been many other changes. Medical researchers and \ntechnologists have not only invented useful instruments (such as \nthose employing the principles of fibre optics which in many contexts \nreplace the more dangerous methods of X-ray diagnostic) but have \nbecome more open towards new (or older) ideas. Only twenty years \nago the idea that the mind affects physical well-being, though \nsupported by experience, was rather unpopular - today it is \nmainstream. Malpractice suits have made physicians more careful, \nsometimes too careful for the good of their patient, but they have also \nforced them to consult alternative opinions. (In Switzerland a \nbelligerent plurality of views is almost part of culture - and I used it \nwhen arranging public confrontations between hardheaded scientists \nand 'alternative' thinkers. 27 However, here as elsewhere, simple \nphilosophies, whether of a dogmatic or a more liberal kind, have their \nlimits. There are no general solutions. An increased liberalism in the \ndefinition of 'fact' can have grave repercussions, 21 while the idea \nthat truth is concealed and even perverted bi the processes that are \nmeant to establish it makes excellent sense. 2 I therefore again warn \nthe reader that I don't have the intention of replacing 'old and \ndogmatic' principles by 'new and more libertarian ones'. For \nexample, I am neither a populist for whom an appeal to 'the people' is \nthe basis of all knowledge, nor a relativist for whom there are no \n'truths as such' but only truths for this or that group and/or \nindividual. All I say is that non-experts often know more than experts \nand should therefore be consulted and that prophets of truth (including \nthose who use arguments) more often than not are carried along by a \nvision that clashes with the very events the vision is supposed to be \nexploring. There exists ample evidence for both parts of this \nassertion. \nA case I already mentioned is development: professionals dealing \nwith the ecological, social and medical parts of developmental aid \nhave by now realized that the imposition of 'rational' or 'scientific' \nprocedures, though occasionally beneficial (removal of some \nparasites and infectious diseases), can lead to serious material and \n20.

    "chunk_full": "Introduction \nto the Chinese Edition \nThis book proposes a thesis and draws consequences from it. The \nthesis is: the events, procedures and results that constitute the sciences have \nno common struaure; there are no elements that occur in every \nscientific investigation but are missing elsewhere. Concrete develop­\nments (such as the overthrow of steady state cosmologies and the \ndiscovery of the structure of DNA) have distinct features and we can \noften explain why and how these features led to success. But not \nevery discovery can be accounted for in the same manner, and \nprocedures that paid off in the past may create havoc when imposed \non the future. Successful research does not obey general standards; it \nrelies now on one trick, now on another; the moves that advance it \nand the standards that define what counts as an advance are not \nalways known to the movers. Far-reaching changes of outlook, such \nas the so-called 'Copernican Revolution' or the 'Darwinian \nRevolution', affect different areas of research in different ways and \nreceive different impulses from them. A theory of science that \ndevises standards and structural elements for all scientific activities \nand authorizes them by reference to 'Reason' or 'Rationality' may \nimpress outsiders - but it is much too crude an instrument for the \npeople on the spot, that is, for scientists facing some concrete \nresearch problem. \nIn this book I try to support the thesis by historical examples. Such \nsupport does not establish it; it makes it plausible and the way in which \nit is reached indicates how future statements about 'the nature of \nscience' may be undermined: given any rule, or any general \nstatement about the sciences, there always exist developments which \nare praised by those who support the rule but which show that the \nrule does more damage than good. \nOne consequence of the thesis is that scientific successes cannot be \nexplained in a simple way. We cannot say: 'the structure of the atomic \nnucleus was found because people did A, B, C .. .

The thesis says that there are no such procedures. Referring \nto the success of 'science' in order to justify, say, quantifying human \nbehaviour is therefore an argument without substance. Quantifica­\ntion works in some cases, fails in others; for example, it ran into \ndifficulties in one of the apparently most quantitative of all sciences, \ncelestial mechanics (special region: stability of the planetary system) \nand was replaced by qualitative (topological) considerations. \nIt also follows that 'non-scientific' procedures cannot be pushed aside by \nargument. To say: 'the procedure you used is non-scientific, therefore \nwe cannot trust your results and cannot give you money for research' \nassumes that 'science' is successful and that it is successful because it \nuses uniform procedures. The first part of the assertion ('science is \nalways successful') is not true, if by 'science' we mean things done by \nscientists - there are lots of failures also. The second part - that \nsuccesses are due to uniform procedures - is not true because there \nare no such procedures. Scientists are like architects who build \nbuildings of different sizes and different shapes and who can be \njudged only after the event, i.e. only after they have finished their \nstructure. It may stand up, it may fall down - nobody knows. \nBut if scientific achievements can be judged only after the event \nand if there is no abstract way of ensuring success beforehand, then \nthere exists no special way of weighing scientific promises either -\nscientists are no better off than anybody else in these matters, they \nonly know more details. This means that the public can participate in the \ndiscussion without disturbing existing roads to success (there are no such \nroads). In cases where the scientists' work affects the public it even \nshould participate: first, because it is a concerned party (many \nscientific decisions affect public life); secondly, because such \nparticipation is the best scientific education the public can get - a full \ndemocratization of science (which includes the protection of \nminorities such as scientists) is not in conflict with science. It is in \nconflict with a philosophy, often called 'Rationalism', that uses a \nfrozen image of science to terrorize people unfamiliar with its \npractice. \nA consequence to which I allude in Chapter 19 and which is \nclosely connected with its basic thesis is that there can be many diferent \nkinds of science.

The remark that without Western science many 'Third World \nnations' would be starving is correct but one should add that the \ntroubles were created, not alleviated by earlier forms of 'develop­\nment'. It is also true that Western medicine helped eradicate \nparasites and some infectious diseases but this does not show that \nWestern science is the only tradition that has good things to offer and \nthat other forms of inquiry are without any merit whatsoever.

'Two very important practical conclusions \nfollow from this [character of the historical process],' writes Lenin, 5 \ncontinuing the passage from which I have just quoted. 'First, that in \norder to fulfil its task, the revolutionary class [i.e. the class of those \nwho want to change either a part of society such as science, or society \nas a whole] must be able to master all forms or aspects of social \nactivity without exception [it must be able to understand, and to \napply, not only one particular methodology, but any methodology, \nand any variation thereof it can imagine] . . .  ; second [it] must be \nready to pass from one to another in the quickest and most \nunexpected manner.' 'The external conditions', writes Einstein, 6 \n'which are set for [the scientist] by the facts of experience do not \npermit him to let himself be too much restricted, in the construction \nof his conceptual world, by the adherence to an epistemological \nsystem. He, therefore, must appear to the systematic epistemologist \nas a type of unscrupulous opportunist. . . .

This is not at all surprising. Methodology and politics are \nboth means for moving from one historical stage to another. We also see how an \nindividual, such as Lenin, who is not intimidated by traditional boundaries and whose \nthought is not tied to the ideology of a particular profession, can give useful advice to \neveryone, philosophers of science included. In the 19th century the idea of an elastic \nand historically informed methodology was a matter of course. Thus Ernst Mach \nwrote in his book Erkenntnis und /mum, Neudruck, Wissenschafdiche Buchgesell­\nschaft, Darmstadt, 1980, p. 200: 'It is often said that research cannot be taught.

    "chunk_full": "INTRODUCTION \n11 \nhave been set up in advance and without regard to the ever-changing \nconditions of history. \nNow it is, of course, possible to simplify the medium in which a scientist \nworks by simplifying its main actors. The history of science, after all, \ndoes not just consist of facts and conclusions drawn from facts. It also \ncontains ideas, interpretations of facts, problems created by conflicting \ninterpretations, mistakes, and so on. On closer analysis we even find \nthat science knows no 'bare facts' at all but that the 'facts' that enter our \nknowledge are already viewed in a certain way and are, therefore, \nessentially ideational. This being the case, the history of science will be \nas complex, chaotic, full of mistakes, and entertaining as the ideas it \ncontains, and these ideas in tum will be as complex, chaotic, full of \nmistakes, and entertaining as are the minds of those who invented \nthem. Conversely, a little brainwashing will go a long way in making the \nhistory of science duller, simpler, more uniform, more 'objective' and \nmore easily accessible to treatment by strict and unchangeable rules. \nScientific education as we know it today has precisely this aim. It \nsimplifies 'science' by simplifying its participants: first, a domain of \nresearch is defined. The domain is separated from the rest of history \n(physics, for example, is separated from metaphysics and from \ntheology) and given a 'logic' of its own. A thorough training in such a \n'logic' then conditions those working in the domain; it makes their \nactions more uniform and it freezes large parts of the historical process \nas well. Stable 'facts' arise and persevere despite the vicissitudes of \nhistory. An essential part of the training that makes such facts appear \nconsists in the attempt to inhibit intuitions that might lead to a \nblurring of boundaries. A person's religion, for example, or his \nmetaphysics, or his sense of humour (his natural sense ofhumour and \nnot the inbred and always rather nasty kind of jocularity one finds in \nspecialized professions) must not have the slightest connection with \nhis scientific activity. His imagination is restrained, and even his \nlanguage ceases to be his own. This is again reflected in the nature of \nscientific 'facts' which are experienced as being independent of \nopinion, belief, and cultural background. \nIt is thus possible to create a tradition that is held together by strict \nrules, and that is also successful to some extent. But is it desirable to \nsupport such a tradition to the exclusion of everything else? Should \nwe transfer to it the sole rights for dealing in knowledge, so that any \nresult that has been obtained by other methods is at once ruled out of \ncourt? And did scientists ever remain within the boundaries of the \nĆraditions they defined in this narrow way? These are the questions I \nIntend to ask in the present essay. And to these questions my answer \nwill be a firm and resounding NO. \n",

The first reason is that the world which we want to \nexplore is a largely unknown entity. We must, therefore, keep our \noptions open and we must not restrict ourselves in advance. \nEpistemological prescriptions may look splendid when compared \nwith other epistemological prescriptions, or with general principles­\nbut who can guarantee that they are the best way to discover, not just \na few isolated 'facts', but also some deep-lying secrets of nature? The \nsecond reason is that a scientific education as described above (and as \npractised in our schools) cannot be reconciled with a humanitarian \nattitude. It is in conflict 'with the cultivation of individuality which \nalone produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings'; 7 it \n'maims by compression, like a Chinese lady's foot, every part of \nhuman nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make a \nperson markedly different in outline'8 from the ideals of rationality \nthat happen to be fashionable in science, or in the philosophy of \nscience. The attempt to increase liberty, to lead a full and rewarding \nlife, and the corresponding attempt to discover the secrets of nature \nand of man, entails, therefore, the rejection of al universal standards \nand of all rigid traditions. (Naturally, it also entails the rejection of a \nlarge part of contemporary science.) \nIt is surprising to see how rarely the stultifying effect of 'the Laws \nof Reason' or of scientific practice is examined by professional \nanarchists. Professional anarchists oppose any kind of restriction and \nthey demand that the individual be permitted to develop freely, \nunhampered by laws, duties or obligations. And yet they swallow \nwithout protest all the severe standards which scientists and logicians \nimpose upon research and upon any kind of knowledge-creating and \nknowledge-changing activity. Occasionally, the laws of scientific \nmethod, or what are thought to be the laws of scientific method \nby a particular writer, are even integrated into anarchism itself. \n'Anarchism is a world concept based upon a mechanical explanation \nof all phenomena,' writes Kropotkin.9 'Its method of investigation is \n7.

One should rather expect that \ncatastrophic changes in the physical environment, wars, the \nbreakdown of encompassing systems of morality, political revolu­\ntions, wil transform adult reaction patterns as well, including \nimportant patterns of argumentation. Such a transformation may \nagain be an entirely natural process and the only function of a rational \nargument may lie in the fact that it increases the mental tension that \npreceded and caused the behavioural outburst. \nNow, if there are events, not necessarily arguments, which cause us \nto adopt new standards, including new and more complex forms of \nargumentation, is it then not up to the defenders of the status quo to \nprovide, not just counter-arguments, but also contrary causes? \n('Virtue without terror is ineffective,' says Robespierre.) And if the \nold forms of argumentation tum out to be too weak a cause, must not \nthese defenders either give up or resort to stronger and more \n'irrational' means? (It is very difficult, and perhaps entirely \nimpossible, to combat the effects of brainwashing by argument.) \nEven the most puritanical rationalist will then be forced to stop \nreasoning and to use propaganda and coercion, not because some of his \nreasons have ceased to be valid, but because the psychological conditions \nwhich make them effective, and capable of influencing others, have \ndisappeared. And what is the use of an argument that leaves people \nunmoved? \nOf course, the problem never arises quite in this form. The \nteaching of standards and their defence never consists merely in \nputting them before the mind of the student and making them as clear \nas possible. The standards are supposed to have maximal causal \neficacy as well. This makes it very difficult indeed to distinguish \nbetween the logical force and the material ejfiaof an argument. Just as a \nwell-trained pet will obey his master no matter how great the \nconfusion in which he finds himself, and no matter how urgent the \nneed to adopt new patterns of behaviour, so in the very same way a \nwell-trained rationalist will obey the mental image of his master, he \nwill conform to the standards of argumentation he has learned, he \nwill adhere to these standards no matter how great the confusion in \nwhich he finds himself, and he will be quite incapable of realizing that \nwhat he regards as the 'voice of reason' is but a causal after-ejfia of the \ntraining he had received. He will be quite unable to discover that the \nappeal to reason to which he succumbs so readily is nothing but a \npolitical manoeuvre. \n",

It is often taken for \ngranted that a clear and distinct understanding of new ideas \nprecedes, and should precede, their formulation and their institu­\ntional expression. First, we have an idea, or a problem, then we act, i.e. \neither speak, or build, or destroy. Yet this is certainly not the way in \nwhich small children develop. They use words, they combine them, \nthey play with them, until they grasp a meaning that has so far been \nbeyond their reach. And the initial playful activity is an essential \nprerequisite of the final act of understanding. There is no reason why \nthis mechanism should cease to function in the adult. We must \nexpect, for example, that the idea of liberty could be made clear only \nby means of the very same actions, which were supposed to create \nliberty. Creation of a thing, and creation plus full understanding of a \ncorrea idea of the thing, are very often parts of one and the same indivisible \nprocess and cannot be separated without bringing the process to a \nstop. The process itself is not guided by a well-defined programme, \nand cannot be guided by such a programme, for it contains the \nconditions for the realization of all possible programmes. It is guided \nrather by a vague urge, by a 'passion' (Kierkegaard). The passion \ngives rise to specific behaviour which in tum creates the cir­\ncumstances and the ideas necessary for analysing and explaining the \nprocess, for making it 'rational'. \nThe development of the Copernican point of view from Galileo to \nthe 20th century is a perfect example of the situation I want to \ndescribe. We start with a strong belief that runs counter to \ncontemporary reason and contemporary experience. The belief \nspreads and finds support in other beliefs which are equally \nunreasonable, if not more so (law of inertia; the telescope). Research \nnow gets deflected in new directions, new kinds of instruments are \nbuilt, 'evidence' is related to theories in new ways until there arises an \nideology that is rich enough to provide independent arguments for \nany particular part of it and mobile enough to find such arguments \nwhenever they seem to be required. We can say today that Galileo \nwas on the right track, for his persistent pursuit of what once seemed \nto be a silly cosmology has by now created the material needed to \ndefend it against all those who will accept a view only if it is told in a \ncertain way and who will trust it only if it contains certain magical \np6rases, called 'observational reports'.

A scientist who wishes to \nmaximize the empirical content of the views he holds and who wants \nto understand them as clearly as he possibly can must therefore \nintroduce other views; that is, he must adopt a pluralistic methodology. \nHe \nmust compare ideas with other \nideas rather than with \n'experience' and he must try to improve rather than discard the views \nthat have failed in the competition. Proceeding in this way he will \nretain the theories of man and cosmos that are found in Genesis, or in \nthe Pimander, he will elaborate them and use them to measure the \nsuccess of evolution and other 'modem' views. He may then discover \nthat the theory of evolution is not as good as is generally assumed and \nthat it must be supplemented, or entirely replaced, by an improved \nversion of Genesis.

Thus our habit of saying 'the table is brown' when \nwe view it under normal circumstances, with our senses in good \norder, but 'the table seems to be brown' when either the lighting \nconditions are poor or when we feel unsure in our capacity of \nobservation expresses the belief that there are familiar cir­\ncumstances when our senses are capable of seeing the world 'as it \nreally is' and other, equally familiar circumstances, when they are \ndeceived. It expresses the belief that some of our sensory \nimpressions are veridical while others are not. We also take it for \ngranted that the material medium between the object and us exerts \nno distorting influence, and that the physical entity that establishes \nthe contact - light - carries a true picture.

How can we discover the kind of world we \npresuppose when proceeding as we do? \nThe answer is clear: we cannot discover it from the inside.

Note also that what is being asserted is not the \ninconsistency of, say, Newton's theory and Galileo's law, but rather the \ninconsistency of some consequences of Newton's theory in the domain \nof validity of Galileo's law, and Galileo's law. In the last case, the \nsituation is especially clear. Galileo's law asserts that the acceleration \nof free fall is a constant, whereas application of Newton's theory to \nthe surface of the earth gives an acceleration that is not constant but \nI. The consistency condition goes back to Aristotle at least. It plays an important \npart in Newton's philosophy (though Newton himself constantly violated it).

Any alternative that \ncontradicts T' outside F and inside M is supported by exactly the \nsame observations and is therefore acceptable if T' was acceptable (I \nshall assume that F are the only observations made). The consistency \ncondition is much less tolerant. It eliminates a theory or a hypothesis \nnot because it disagrees with the facts; it eliminates it because it \ndisagrees with another theory, with a theory, moreover, whose \nconfirming instances it shares. It thereby makes the as yet untested \npart of that theory a measure of validity. The only difference between \nsuch a measure and a more recent theory is age and familiarity. Had \nthe younger theory been there first, then the consistency condition \nwould have worked in its favour.

The only \nreal improvement, so the defender of the consistency condition will \ncontinue, derives from the adition of new facts. Such new facts will \neither support the current theories, or they will force us to modify \nthem by indicating precisely where they go wrong. In both cases they \nwill precipitate real progress and not merely arbitrary change. The \nproper procedure must therefore consist in the confrontation of the \naccepted point of view with as many relevant facts as possible. The \nexclusion of alternatives is then simply a measure of expediency: their \ninvention not only does not help, it even hinders progress by \nabsorbing time and manpower that could be devoted to better things. \nThe consistency condition eliminates such fruitless discussion and it \nforces the scientist to concentrate on the facts which, after all, are the \nonly acceptable judges of a theory. This is how the practising scientist \nwill defend his concentration on a single theory to the exclusion of \nempirically possible alternatives. \nIt is worthwhile repeating the reasonable core of this argument. \nTheories should not be changed unless there are pressing reasons for \ndoing so. The only pressing reason for changing a theory is \ndisagreement with facts. Discussion of incompatible facts will \ntherefore lead to progress. Discussion of incompatible hypotheses \nwil not.

One might wish to \nadd that formal improvements such as increased elegance, simplicity, \ngenerality, and coherence should not be excluded. But once these \nimprovements have been carried out, the collection of facts for the \npurpose of tests seems indeed to be the only thing left to the scientist. \nAnd so it is - provided facts exist, and are available independently of \nwhether or not one considers alternatives to the theory to be tested. This \nassumption, on which the validity of the foregoing argument depends \nin a most decisive manner, I shall call the assumption of the relative \nautonomy of facts, or the autonomy principle.

All these investigations use a model in which a \nsingle theory is compared with a class of facts (or observation \nstatements) which are assumed to be 'given' somehow. I submit that \nthis is much too simple a picture of the actual situation. Facts and \ntheories are much more intimately connected than is admitted by the \nautonomy principle. Not only is the description of every single fact \ndependent on some theory (which may, of course, be very different \nfrom the theory to be tested), but there also exist facts which cannot \nbe unearthed except with the help of alternatives to the theory to be \ntested, and which become unavailable as soon as such alternatives are \nexcluded. This suggests that the methodological unit to which we \nmust refer when discussing questions of test and empirical content is \nconstituted by a whole set of partly uverlapping, factually adequate, but \nmutually inconsistent theories. In the present chapter only the barest \noutlines will be given of such a test model.

Brownian motion therefore belongs \nto the domain of relevant facts for the law. Now could this relation \nbetween Brownian motion and the law have been discovered in a \ndirea manner i.e. could it have been discovered by an examination of \nthe observational consequences of the phenomenological theory that \ndid not make use of an alternative theory of heat? This question is \nreadily divided into two: (1) Could the relevance of the Brownian \nparticle have been discovered in this manner?

It is \nimpossible to say what would have happened if the kinetic theory had \nnot been introduced into the debate. It is my guess, however, that in \nthat case the Brownian particle would have been regarded as an \noddity - in much the same way as some of the late Professor \nEhrenhaft' s astounding effects were regarded as an oddity, and that it \nwould not have been given the decisive position it assumed in \ncontemporary theory. The answer to the second question is simply ­\nNo. Consider what the discovery of an inconsistency between the \nphenomenon of Brownian motion and the second law would have \nrequired. It would have required: (a) measurement of the exact \nmotion of the particle in order to ascertain the change in its kinetic \nenergy plus the energy spent on overcoming the resistance of the \n4uid; and (b) precise measurements of temperature and heat transfer \nm the surrounding medium in order to establish that any loss \n",

Hence a 'direct' refutation of the second law that \nconsiders only the phenomenological theory and the 'facts' of the \nBrownian motion is impossible. It is impossible because of the \nstructure of the world in which we live and because of the laws that \nare valid in this world. And as is well known, the actual refutation \nwas brought about in a very different manner. It was brought about \nvia the kinetic theory and Einstein's utilization of it in his calculation \nof the statistical properties of Brownian motion. In the course of \nthis procedure, the phenomenological theory (T') was incorporated \ninto the wider context of statistical physics (T) in such a manner \nthat the consistency condition was violated, and it was only then that \ncrucial experiments were staged (investigations of Svedberg and \nPerrin).5 \n4. For details cf. R. Fiirth, Zs. Physik, Vol. 81, 1933, pp. 143fT. \n5. For these investigations (whose philosophical background derives from \nBoltzmann) cf. A. Einstein, Investigations on the Theory of the Bro11mian Motion, ed. R. \nFiirth, New York, 1956, which contains all the relevant papers by Einstein and an ex­\nhaustive bibliography by R. Fiirth. For the experimental work of J. Perrin, see Die \nA tome, Leipzig, 1920. For the relation between the phenomenological theory and the \nkinetic theory of von Smoluchowski, see 'Experimentell nachweisbare, der iiblichen \nThermodynamik widersprechende Molekularphanomene', Physikalische Zs., Vol. 8, \n1912, p. 1069, as well as the brief note by K.R. Popper, 'Irreversibility, or, Entropy \nsince 1905', British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Vol. 8, 1957, p. 151, which \nsummarizes the essential arguments. Despite Einstein's epoch-making discoveries \nand von Smoluchowski's splendid presentation of their consequences (Oeuvres de \nMarie Smoluchowski, Cracow, 1927, Vol. 2, pp. 226fT, 316fT, 462fT and 530ff}, the \npresent situation in thermodynamics is extremely unclear, especially in view of the \ncontinued presence of some very doubtful ideas of reduction. To be more specific, the \nattempt is frequently made to determine the entropy balance of a complex statistical \nprocess by reference to the (refuted) phenomenological law after which fluctuations are \ninserted in an ad hoc fashion. For this cf. my note 'On the Possibility of a Perpetuum \nMobile of the Second Kind',Mind, MatterandMethod, Minneapolis, 1966, p. 409, and \nmy paper 'In Defence of Classical Physics', Studies in the History and Philosophy of \nScience, I, No. 2, 1970. \nIt ought to be mentioned, incidentally, that in 1903, when Einstein started his work \nin thermodynamics, there existed empirical evidence suggesting that Brownian motion \ncould not be a molecular phenomenon. See F.M. Exner, 'Notiz zu Browns \nMolekularbewegung',Ann. Phys., No. 2, 1900, p. 843. Exner claimed that the motion \nwas of orders of magnitude beneath the value to be expected on the equipartition \nprinciple. Einstein (Investigations in the Theory of the Bro11mian Muvement, pp. 63fT, esp. \np. 6 7) gave the following theoretical explanation of the discrepancy: 'since an observer \noperating with definite means of observation in a definite manner can never perceive \nthe actual path transversed in an arbitrarily small time, a certain mean velocity will \n",

Both the \nrelevance and the refuting character of decisive facts can be \nestablished only with the help of other theories which, though \nfactually adequate, 6 are not in agreement with the view to be tested. \nThis being the case, the invention and articulation of alternatives may \nhave to precede the production of refuting facts. Empiricism, at least \nin some of its more sophisticated versions, demands that the \nempirical content of whatever knowledge we possess be increased as \nmuch as possible. Hence the invention of alternatives to the view at the \ncentre of discussion constitutes an essential part of the empirical method. \nConversely the fact that the consistency condition eliminates \nalternatives now shows it to be in disagreement not only with \nscientific practice but with empiricism as well. By excluding valuable \ntests it decreases the empirical content of the theories that are \npermitted to remain (and these, as I have indicated above, will usually \nbe the theories which were there first); and it especially decreases the \nnumber of those facts that could show their limitations. This is how \nempiricists (such as Newton, or some proponents of what has been \ncalled the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics) who \ndefend the consistency condition, being unaware of the complex \nnature of scientific knowledge (and, for that matter, of any form of \nknowledge) are voiding their favourite theories of empirical content \nand thus turning them into what they most despise, viz. metaphysical \ndoctrines. 7 \nJohn Stuart Mill has given a fascinating account of the gradual \ntransformation of revolutionary ideas into obstacles to thought. \nWhen a new view is proposed it faces a hostile audience and excellent \nreasons are needed to gain for it an even moderately fair hearing. The \nreasons are produced, but they are often disregarded or laughed out \nof court, and unhappiness is the fate of the bold inventors. But new \ngenerations, being interested in new things, become curious; they \nconsider the reasons, pursue them further and groups of researchers \ninitiate detailed studies. The studies may lead to surprising successes \n(they also raise lots of difficulties). Now nothing succeeds like \nalways appear to him as an instantaneous velocity.

The condition of factual adequacy will be removed in Chapter 5. \n1 · The most dramatic confirmation of the orthodox view which made its empirical \nnature obvious came by way of Bell's theorem. But Bell was on the side of Einstein, not \nof Bohr, whom he regarded as an 'obscurantist'. Cf. Jeremy Bernstein, Quantum \nProfiles, Princeton, 1991, pp. 3ff (for Bell's background) and p. 84 (for 'obscurantist'). \n",

Two earlier \nauthors are Mill and Niels Bohr. Mill gives a clear and compelling \ndescription of the transition from the early stage of a new view to its \northodoxy. Debates and reasoning, he writes, are features \nbelonging to periods of transition, when old notions and feelings have \nbeen unsettled and no new doctrines have yet succeeded to their \nascendancy. At such times people of any mental activity, having given \nup their old beliefs, and not feeling quite sure that those they still \nretain can stand unmodified listen eagerly to new opinions.

Bohr's presentation of new discoveries has precisely \nthis pattern; it contains preliminary summaries surveying the past, \nmoves on to the 'present state of knowledge' and ends up by making \ngeneral suggestions for the future. 10 \nMill's views and Bohr's procedure are not only an expression of \ntheir liberal attitude; they also reflect their conviction that a pluralism \nof ideas and forms of life is an essential part of any rational inquiry \nconcerning the nature of things.

An account and a truly humanitarian defence of this position can be found inj.S. \nMill's On Liberty. Popper's philosophy, which some people would like to lay on us as the \none and only humanitarian rationalism in existence today, is but a pale reflection of Mill. \nIt is specialized, formalistic and elitist, and devoid of the concern for individual \nhappiness that is such a characteristic feature of Mill. We can understand its \npeculiarities when we consider (a) the background oflogical positivism, which plays an \nimportant role in the Logic of Scientific DisCflVery, (b) the unrelenting puritanism of its \nauthor (and of most of his followers), and when we remember the influence of Harriet \nTaylor on Mill's life and on his philosophy. There is no Harriet Taylor in Popper's life. \nThe foregoing arguments should also have made it clear that I regard proliferation not \njust as an 'external catalyst' of progress, as Lakatos suggests in his essays ('History of \nScience and Its Rational Reconstructions', Boston Studies, Vol. 8, p. 98; 'Popper on \nDemarcation and Induction', MS, 1970, p. 21 ), but as an essential part ofit. Ever since \n'Explanation, Reduction, and Empiricism' (Minnesota Studies, Vol. 3, Minneapolis, \n1962), and especially in 'How to Be a Good Empiricist' (Delaware Studies, Vol. 2, 1963), I \nhave argued that alternatives increase the empirical content of the views that happen to \nstand in the centre of attention and are, therefore, 'necessary parts' of the falsifying \nprocess (Lakatos, 'History', fn. 27, describing his own position). In 'Reply to Criticism' \n(Boston Studies, Vol. 2, 1965) I pointed out that 'the principle of proliferation not only \nrecommends invention of new alternatives, it also prevents the elimination of older \ntheories which have been refuted. The reason is that such theories contribute to the \ncontent oftheirvictorious rivals' (p. 224). This agrees with Lakatos' observation ofl971 \nthat 'alternatives are not merely catalysts, which can later be removed in the rational \nreconstruction' ('History', fn. 27), except that Lakatos attributes the psychologistic view \nto me and my actual views to himself. Considering the argument in the text, it is clear that \nthe increasing separation of the history, the philosophy of science and of science itselfis a \ndisadvantage and should be terminated in the interest of all these three disciplines. \nOtherwise we shall get tons of minute, precise, but utterly barren results. \n3.

Skinner, Beyond Freetkm and \nDignity, New York, 1971, p. 5: 'No modem physicist would tum to Aristotle for help.' \nThis is neither true, nor would it be an advantage if it were true. Aristotelian ideas \ninfluenced research long after they had allegedly been removed by early modem \nastronomy and physics - any history of 17th- or 18th-century science wil show that \n(example: John Heilbronn's marvellous Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries, \nBerkeley and Los Angeles, 1979). They resurfaced in biology, in the thermodynamics \nof open systems and even in mathematics. Aristotle's theory oflocomotion (which has \nthe consequence that a moving object has no precise length and that an object having a \nprecise location must be at rest) was more advanced than the Galilean view and \nshowed that ideas which in our time emerged from empirical research can be obtained \nby a careful analysis of the problems of the continuum (details on this point in Chapter \n8 of my Farewell to Reason, London, 1987). Here as elsewhere the propagandists of a \nnaive scientism give themselves the air of presenting arguments when all they do is \nspread unexamined and ill-conceived rumours. \n",

These theories, \nwhich were expressed in sociological, not in mathematical, terms, have left their traces \nin sagas, myths, legends and may be reconstructed in a twofold way, by goingforJ0ard \ninto the present from the material remains of Stone Age astronomy such as marked \nstones, stone observatories, etc., and by going back into the past from the literary \nremains which we find in sagas, legends, myths.

Herbal \nmedicine, acupuncture, moxibustion and the underlying philosophy \nare a thing of the past, no longer to be taken seriously. This was the \nattitude up to about 1954 when the condemnation of bourgeois \nelements in the Ministry of Health started a campaign for the revival \nof traditional medicine. No doubt the campaign was politically \ninspired. It contained at least two elements, viz. (1) the identification \nof Western science with bourgeois science and (2) the refusal of the \nparty to exempt science from political supervision 1 1  and to grant \nexperts special privileges. But it provided the counterforce that was \nneeded to overcome the scientific chauvinism of the time and to make \na plurality (actually a duality) of views possible. (This is an important \npoint. It often happens that parts of science become hardened and \nintolerant so that proliferation must be enforced from the outside, \nand by political means. Of course, success cannot be guaranteed -\nsee the Lysenko affair. But this does not remove the need for non­\nscientific controls on science.) \nNow this politically enforced dualism has led to most interesting \nand puzzling discoveries both in China and in the West and to the \nrealization that there are effects and means of diagnosis which \nmodem medicine cannot repeat and for which it has no explanation. \nIt revealed sizeable lacunae in Western medicine. Nor can one expect \nthat the customary scientific approach will eventually find an answer. \nIn the case of herbal medicine the approach consists of two steps. 12 \nFirst, the herbal concoction is analysed into its chemical constituents. \nThen the specific effects of each constituent are determined and the \ntotal effect on a particular organ explained on their basis. This \nneglects the possibility that the herb, taken in its entirety, changes the \nstate of the whole organism and that it is this new state of the whole \norganism rather than a specific part of the herbal concoction, a 'magic \nbullet', as it were, that cures the diseased organ. Here as elsewhere \nknowledge is obtained from a multiplicity of views rather than from \nthe determined application of a preferred ideology. And we realize \nthat proliferation may have to be enforced by non-scientific agencies \nwhose power is sufficient to overcome the most powerful scientific \ninstitutions. Examples are the Church, the State, a political party, \npublic discontent, or money: the best single entity to get a modem \nscientist away from what his 'scientific conscience' tells him to pursue \nis still the dollar (or, more recently, the Swiss franc). \nI I.

Such an education, \nhowever, has very often seemed to be a futile exercise in day­\ndreaming. For is it not necessary to prepare the young for life as it \nactually is? Does this not mean that they must learn one particular set of \nviews to the exclusion of everything else? And, if a trace of their \nimagination is still to remain, will it not find its proper application in \nthe arts or in a thin domain of dreams that has but little to do with the \nworld we live in? Will this procedure not finally lead to a split between \na hated reality and welcome fantasies, science and the arts, careful \ndescription and unrestrained self-expression? The argument for \nproliferation shows that this need not happen. It is possible to retain \nwhat one might call the freedom of artistic creation and to use it to the \nfull, not just as a road of escape but as a necessary means for \ndiscovering and perhaps even changing the features of the world we \nlive in.

Newton's theory of \ngravitation was beset, from the very beginp.ing, by difficulties serious \nenough to provide material for refutation. 4 Even quite recently and in \nthe non-relativistic domain it could be said that there 'exist numerous \ndiscrepancies between observation and theory'.5 Bohr's atomic \nmodel was introduced, and retained, in the face of precise and \nunshakeable contrary evidence. 6 The special theory of relativity was \nretained despite Kaufmann's unambiguous results of 1906, and \ndespite D.C. Miller's experiment.7 The general theory of relativity, \nCopernicus could clearly refute it, inasmuch as a most important argument taken from \nthe movement of Mars and Venus always stood in their way.'

What Newton means is \nthat gravitation disturbs the planets in a way that is likely to blow the planetary system \napart. Babylonian data as used by Ptolemy show that the planetary system has remained \nstable for a long time. Newton concluded that it was being periodically 'reformed' by \ndivine interventions: God acts as a stabilizing force in the planetary system (and in the \nworld as a whole, which is constantly losing motion through processes such as inelastic \ncollisions). One of the 'irregularities' considered by Newton, the great inequality of \nJupiter and Saturn (Principia, transl. Motte, ed. Cajori, Berkeley, 1934, p. 397) was \nshown by Laplace to be a periodic disturbance with a large period. Then Poincare found \nthat the series developments customary in the calculations often diverged after they had \nshown some convergence while Bruhns discovered that no quantitative methods other \nthan series expansions could resolve the n-body problem. This was the end of the purely \nquantitative period in celestial mechanics (details inJ. Moser, Annals ofMathnnatical \nStudies, Vol. 77, 1973, Princeton). See also M.

Repeating considerations by Newcomb (reported, for example, in Chazy, op. \ncit., pp. 204ff), Dicke pointed out that an oblateness of the sun would add classical \nterms to Mercury's motion and reduce the excess (compared with Newton's theory) \nadvance of its perihelion. Measurements by Dicke and Goldenberg then found a \ndifference of 52 km between the equatorial and polar diameter of the sun and a \ncorresponding reduction of three seconds of arc for Mercury - a sizeable deviation \nfrom the relativistic value.

In most of these cases we are dealing with quantitative \nproblems which can be resolved by discovering a better set of numbers \nbut which do not force us to make qualitative adjustments. 12 \n1 1. Tests outside the planetary system (cosmology, black holes, pulsars) are \nneeded to examine alternatives that agree with Einsteinian relativity inside the solar \nsystem. There now exists a considerable number of such alternatives and special steps \nhave been taken to classify them and to elucidate their similarities and differences. Cf. \nthe introduction to C.M. Will, op. cit. \n12. The situation just described shows how silly it would be to approach science \nfrom a naive-falsificationist perspective. Yet this is precisely what some philosophers \nhave been trying to do. Thus Herbert Feigl (Minnesota Studies, Vol. 5, 1971, p. 7) and \nKarl Popper (Objective Knowledge, p. 78) have tried to tum Einstein into a naive \nfalsificationist. Feigl writes: 'If Einstein relied on \"beauty\", \"harmony\", \"symmetry\", \n\"elegance\" in constructing . . .  his general theory of relativity, it must nevertheless be \nremembered that he also said (in a lecture in Prague in 1920 - I was present then as a \nvery young student): \"If the observations of the red shift in the spectra of massive stars \ndon't come out quantitatively in accordance with the principles of general relativity, \nthen my theory wil be dust and ashes\".' Popper writes: 'Einstein . . .  said that if the red \nshift effect . . . was not observed in the case of white dwarfs, his theory of general \nrelativity would be refuted.' \nPopper gives no source for his story, and he most likely has it from Feigl. But Feigl's \nstory and Popper's repetition conflict with the numerous occasions where Einstein \nemphasizes the 'reason of the matter' ('die Vemunft der Sache') over and above \n'verification oflittle effects' and this not only in casual remarks during a lecture, but in \nwriting. Cf. the quotation in footnote 7 above, which deals with difficulties of the \nspecial theory of relativity and precedes the talk at which F eigl was present. Cf. also the \nletters to M. Besso and K. Seelig as quoted in G. Holton, 'Influences on Einstein's \nEarly Work', Organon, No. 3, 1966, p. 242, and K. Seelig, A Ibm Einstein, Zurich, \n1960, p. 271. In 1952 Born wrote to Einstein (Born-Einstein Leters, New York, 1971, \np. 190, dealing with Freundlich's analysis of the bending of light near the sun and the \nred shift): 'It really looks as if your formula is not quite correct. It looks even worse in \nthe case of the red shift [the crucial case referred to by Feigl and Popper]; this is much \nsmaller than the theoretical value towards the centre of the sun's disk, and much larger \nat the edges . . . .  Could this be a hint of non-linearity?' Einstein (letterof12 May 1952, \nop. cit., p. 192) replied. 'Freundlich . . .  does not move me in the slightest. Even if the \ndeflection oflight, the perihelial movement or line shift were unknown, the gravitation \nequations would still be convincing because they avoid the inertial system (the \nphantom which affects everything but is not itself affected). It is really strange that \nhuman beings are normally deaf to the strongest arguments while they are always inclined to \nuverestimate measuring accuracies' (my italics). How is this conflict (between Feigl's \ntestimony and Einstein's writings) to be explained? It cannot be explained by a change in \nEinstein's attitude. His disrespectful attitude towards observation and experiment was \nthere from the very beginning, as we have seen. It might be explained either by a \nmistake on Feigl's part, or else as another instance of Einstein's 'opportunism' - cf. \ntext to footnote 6 of the Introduction. \nOn the last page (p. 91) of his Uber die Spezielle und allgemeine Relativitiitstheorie, \n",

In this case a theory is inconsistent \nnot with a recondite fact, that can be unearthed with the help of \ncomplex equipment and is known to experts only, but with \ncircumstances which are easily noticed and which are familiar to \neveryone. \nThe first and, to my mind, the most important example of an \ninconsistency of this kind is Parmenides' theory of the unchanging \nand homogeneous One. This theory illustrates a desire that has \npropelled the Western sciences from their inception up to the present \ntime - the desire to find a unity behind the many events that surround \nus. Today the unity sought is a theory rich enough to produce all the \naccepted facts and laws; at the time of Parmenides the unity sought \nwas a substance. Thales had proposed water, 13 Heraclitus fire, \nAnaximander a substance which he called the apeiron and which \ncould produce all four elements without being identical with a single \none of them. Parmenides gave what seems to be an obvious and \nrather trivial answer: the substance that underlies everything that is is \nBeing. But this trivial answer had surprising consequences. For \nexample, we can assert that (first principle) Being is and that (second \nprinciple) Not Being is not. Now consider change and assume it to be \nfundamental. Then change can only go from Being to Not Being. But \naccording to the second principle Not Being is not, which means that \nthere is no fundamental change. Next consider diference and \nassume it to be fundamental. Then the difference can only be \nbetween Being and Not Being. But (second principle) Not Being is \nnot and therefore there exist no differences in Being - it is a single, \nunchanging, continuous block. Parmenides knew of course that \npeople, himself included, perceive and accept change and difference; \nbut as his argument had shown that the perceived processes could \nnot be fundamental he had to regard them as merely apparent, or \ndeceptive. This is indeed what he said - thus anticipating all those \nscientists who contrasted the 'real' world of science with the everyday \nworld of qualities and emotions, declared the latter to be 'mere \nappearance' and tried to base their arguments on 'objective' \nexperiments and mathematics exclusively. He also anticipated a \nBrunswick, 1922, Einstein writes: 'If the red shift of the spectral lines caused by the \ngravitational potential did not exist, then the general theory of relativity would be \nuntenable.'

Using \nParmenides' arguments Aristotle constructed a theory of space and \nmotion that anticipated some very deep-lying properties of quantum \nmechanics and evaded the difficulties of the more customary (and \nless sophisticated) interpretation of a continuum as consisting of \nindivisible elements.15 Parmenides' theory clashes with most \nmodem methodological principles- but this is no reason to disregard \nit. \nA more specific example of a theory with qualitative defects is \nNewton's theory of colours. According to this theory, light consists of \nrays of different refrangibility which can be separated, reunited, \nrefracted, but which are never changed in their internal constitution, \nand which have a very small lateral extension in space. Considering \nthat the surface of mirrors is much rougher than the lateral extension \nof the rays, the ray theory is found to be inconsistent with the \nexistence of mirror images (as is admitted by Newton himself): if light \nconsists of rays, then a mirror should behave like a rough surface, i.e. \nit should look to us like a wall. Newton retained his theory, \neliminating the difficulty with the help of an ad hoc hypothesis: 'the \nreflection of a ray is effected, not by a single point of the reflecting \nbody, but by some power of the body which is evenly diffused all over \nits surface' } 6  \n14.

The usual \nprocedure is to forget the difficulties, never to talk about them, and to \nproceed as if the theory were without fault. This attitude is very \ncommon today. \nThus the classical electrodynamics of Maxwell and Lorentz \nimplies that the motion of a free particle is self-accelerated. \nConsidering the self-energy of the electron one obtains divergent \nexpressions for point-charges while charges of finite extension can be \nmade to agree with relativity onlÿ by adding untestable stresses and \npressures inside the electron. 1 \nThe problem reappears in the \nquantum theory, though it is here partially covered up by \n'renormalization'. This procedure consists in crossing out the results \nof certain calculations and replacing them by a description of what is \nactually observed. Thus one admits, implicitly, that the theory is in \ntrouble while formulating it in a manner suggesting that a new \nprinciple has been discovered. 20 Small wonder when philosophic­\nally unsophisticated authors get the impression that 'all evidence \npoints with merciless definiteness in the . . .  direction . . .  [that] all \nthe processes involving . . . unknown interactions conform to the \nfundamental quantum law.'21 \nA striking example of qualitative failure is the status of classical \nmechanics and electrodynamics after Boltzmann's equipartition \ntheorem. According to this theorem energy is equally distributed \nover all degrees of freedom of a (mechanical or electrodynamic) \nsystem. Both atoms (which had to be elastic to rebound from the walls \nof a container and from each other) and the electromagnetic field had \ninfinitely many degrees of freedom which meant that solids and the \n19.

This shows that a point of view which, looked at \nfrom afar, appears to be hopelessly wrong may contain excellent ingredients and that \nits excellence may remain unrevealed to those guided by strict methodological rules. \nAlways remember that my examples do not criticize science; they criticize those who \nwant to subject it to their simpleminded rules by showing the disasters such rules \nwould create. Each of the examples of footnotes 3-17 can be used as a basis for case \nstudies of the kind to be carried out in Chapters 6-12 (Galileo and the Copernican \nRevolution). This shows that the case ofGalileo is not 'an exception characterizing the \nbeginning of the so-called scientific revolution' (G. Radnitzky, 'Theorienpluralismus \nTheorienmonismus', in Diemer Meisenheim (ed.), Der Methodm- und Theorien­\npluralismus in dm Wissenschafien, 1971, p. 164) but is typical of scientific change at all \ntimes. \n21.

Ehrenfest proved a theorem according to \nwhich the classical electron theory of Lorentz taken in conjunction \nwith the equipartition theorem excludes induced magnetism. 23 The \nreasoning is exceedingly simple; according to the equipartition \ntheorem, the probability of a given motion is proportional to exp \n(- UIR1), where U is the energy of the motion. Now the rate of work \nof an electron moving in a constant magnetic field B is, according to \nLorentz, W=Q(E+ VxB). V, where Q is the charge of the moving \nparticle, V its velocity and E the electric field. This magnitude \nreduces to QEV, which means that the energy and, therefore, the \nprobability remains unaffected by a magnetic field. (Given the proper \ncontext, this result strongly supports the ideas and experimental \nfindings of the late Felix Ehrenhaft.) \nOccasionally it is impossible to survey all the interesting \nconsequences, and thus to discover the absurd results of a theory. \nThis may be due to a deficiency in the existing mathematical \nmethods; it may also be due to the ignorance of those who defend the \ntheory. Under such circumstances, the most common procedure is to \nuse an older theory up to a certain point (which is often quite \narbitrary) and to add the new theory for calculating refinements. \nSeen from a methodological point of view the procedure is a veritable \nnightmare. Let us explain it using the relativistic calculation of the \npath of Mercury as an example. \nThe perihelion of Mercury moves along at a rate of about 5600\" \nper century. Of this value, 5026\" are geometric, having to do with the \nmovement of the reference system, while 531\" are dynamical, due to \nperturbations in the solar system.

This is how the \nsituation is usually explained. \nThe explanation shows that the premise from which we derive the \n4 3\" is not the general theory of relativity plus suitable initial \nconditions. The premise contains classical physics in adition to \nwhatever relativistic assumptions are being made. Furthermore, the \nrelativistic calculation, the so-called 'Schwarzschild solution', does \nnot deal with the planetary system as it exists in the real world (i.e. our \nown asymmetric galaxy); it deals with the entirely fictional case of a \ncentral symmetrical universe containing a singularity in the middle \nand nothing else. What are the reasons for employing such an odd \nconjunction of premises? \nThe reason, according to the customary reply, is that we are \ndealing with approximations. The formulae of classical physics do \nnot appear because relativity is incomplete. Nor is the centrally \nsymmetric case used because relativity does not offer anything better. \nBoth schemata flow from the general theory under the special \ncircumstances realized in our planetary system pruvided we omit \nmagnitudes too small to be considered. Hence, we are using the \ntheory of relativity throughout, and we are using it in an adequate \nmanner. \nNow in the present case, making the required approximations \nwould mean calculating the full n-body problem relativistically \n(including long-term resonances between different planetary orbits), \nomitting magnitudes smaller than the precision of observation \nreached, and showing that the theory thus curtailed coincides with \nclassical celestial mechanics as corrected by Schwarzschild. This \nprocedure has not been used by anyone simply because the \nrelativistic n-body problem has as yet withstood solution. When the \nargument started, there were not even approximate solutions for \nimportant problems such as, for example, the problem of stability \n(one of the first great stumbling blocks for Newton's theory). The \nclassical part of the explanans, therefore, did not occur just for \nconvenience, it was absolutely necessary.

At \nthe moment we are not concerned with the reasons for this fact, we \nare only concerned with its consequences: ad hoc approximations \nconceal, and even eliminate, qualitative difficulties. They create a \nfalse impression of the excellence of our science. It follows that a \nphilosopher who wants to study the adequacy of science as a picture \nof the world, or who wants to build up a realistic scientific \nmethodology, must look at modem science with special care. In most \ncases modem science is more opaque, and more deceptive, than its \n16th- and 17th-century ancestors have ever been. \nAs a final example of qualitative difficulties I mention again the \nheliocentric theory at the time of Galileo. I shall soon have occasion \nto show that this theory was inadequate both qualitatively and \nquantitatively, and that it was also philosophically absurd. \nTo sum up this brief and very incomplete list: wherever we look, \nwhenever we have a little patience and select our evidence in an \nunprejudiced manner, we find that theories fail adequately to \nreproduce certain quantitative results, and that they are qualitatively \nincompetent to a surprising degree. Science gives us theories of great \nbeauty and sophistication. Modem science has developed mathe­\nmatical structures which exceed anything that has existed so far in \ncoherence generality and empirical success. But in order to achieve \nthis miracle all the existing troubles had to be pushed into the relation \nbetween theory and fact, 25 and had to be concealed, by ad hoc \nhypotheses, ad hoc approximations and other procedures. \nguesses whose formal relation to the basic assumptions is difficult to ascertain. 'I must \n. . .  confess', writes Descartes in his Discourse on Method (Library of Liberal Arts, 1965, \np. 52), 'that the power of nature is so ample and so vast, and these principles [the \ntheoretical principles he had developed for his mechanical universe] so simple and so \ngeneral, that I almost never notice any particular effect such that I do not see right away \nthat it can [be made to conform to these principles] in many different ways; and my \ngreatest difficulty is usually to discover in which of these ways the effect is derived.' \nModem theoretical physicists find themselves in exacdy the same situation. \n25. Von Neumann's work in quantum mechanics is an especially instructive \nexample of this procedure. In order to arrive at a satisfactory proof of the expansion \ntheorem in Hilbert Space, von Neumann replaced the quasi-intuitive notions of Dirac \n(and Bohr) by more complex notions of his own. The theoretical relations between the \nnew notions are accessible to a more rigorous treatment than the theoretical relations \nbetween the notions that preceded them ('more rigorous' from the point of view of von \nNeumann and his followers). It is different with their relation to experimental \nprocedures. No measuring instruments can be specified for the great majority of \nobservables (Wigner, American Journal of Physics, Vol. 31, 1963, p. 14), and where \nspecification is possible it becomes necessary to modify well-known and unrefuted \n",

This demand, these \ntheories, are now all seen to be quite useless. They are as useless as a \nmedicine that heals a patient only if he is bacteria-free. In practice \nthey are never obeyed by anyone. Methodologists may point to the \nimportance of falsifications - but they blithely use falsified theories, \nthey may sermonize how important it is to consider all the relevant \nevidence, and never mention those big and drastic facts which show \nthat the theories they admire and accept may be as badly off as the \nolder theories which they reject. In practice they slavishly repeat the \nmost recent pronouncements of the top dogs in physics, though \nin doing so they must violate some very basic rules of their trade. \nIs it fossible to proceed in a more reasonable manner? Let us \nsee!2 \nAccording to Hume, theories cannot be derived from facts. The \ndemand to admit only those theories which follow from facts leaves \nus without any theory. Hence, science as we know it can exist only if \nwe drop the demand and revise our methodology. \nAccording to our present results, hardly any theory is consistent with \nthe facts. The demand to admit only those theories which are \nconsistent with the available and accepted facts again leaves us \nwithout any theory. (I repeat: without any theory, for there is not a \nsingle theory that is not in some trouble or other.) Hence, a science as \nwe know it can exist only if we drop this demand also and again revise \nour methodology, now admitting counterinduaion in adition to \nadmitting unsupported hypotheses.

Cook, Journal \nof Mathematical Physics, Vol. 36, 1 957). Thus the theory becomes a veritable monster of \nrigour and precision while its relation to experience is more obscure than ever. It is \ninteresting to see that similar developments occur in 'primitive thought'. 'The most \nstriking features of Nupe sand divining', writes S.F. Nader in Nupe Religion, 1 954, \np. 63, 'is the contrast between its pretentious theoretical framework and its primitive \nand slipshod application in practice.' It does not need a science to produce \nNeumannian nightmares. \n26.

For in this way he hints at believing \nthat to those who say such motion is not straight at all, but rather \ncircular, it seems they see the stone move visibly in an arc, since he \ncalls upon their senses rather than their reason to clarify the effect. \nThis is not the case, Simplicio; for just as I . . .  have never seen nor \never expect to see, the rock fall any way but perpendicularly, just so \ndo I believe that it appears to the eyes of everyone else. It is, therefore, \nbetter to put aside the appearance, on which we al agree, and to use \nthe power of reason either to confirm its reality or to reveal its \nfallacy.'4 The correctness of the observation is not in question. What \nis in question is its 'reality' or 'fallacy'. What is meant by this \nexpression? \nThe question is answered by an example that occurs in Galileo's \nnext paragraph, 'from which . . .  one may learn how easily anyone \nmay be deceived by simple appearance, or let us say by the \nimpressions of one's senses. This event is the appearance to those \nwho travel along a street by night ofbeing followed by the moon, with \nsteps equal to theirs, when they see it go gliding along the eaves of the \nroofs. There it looks to them just as would a cat really running along \nthe tiles and putting them behind it; an appearance which, if reason \ndid not intervene, would only too obviously deceive the senses.' \nIn this example, we are asked to start with a sensory impression and \nto consider a statement that is forcefully suggested by it. (The \nsuggestion is so strong that it has led to entire systems ofbelief and to \nrituals, as becomes clear from a closer study of the lunar aspects of \nwitchcraft and of other cosmological hypotheses.) Now 'reason \nintervenes'; the statement suggested by the impression is examined, \nand one considers other statements in its place.

What are the reasons and the \nmethods which regulate such an exchange? \nTo start with, we must become clear about the nature of the total \nphenomenon: appearance plus statement. There are not two acts -\none, noticing a phenomenon; the other, expressing it with the help of \nthe appropriate statement - but only one, viz. saying in a certain \nobservational situation, 'the moon is following me', or, 'the stone is \nfalling straight down'. We may, of course, abstractly subdivide this \nprocess into parts, and we may also try to create a situation where \nstatement and phenomenon seem to be psychologically apart and \nwaiting to be related. (This is rather difficult to achieve and is \nperhaps entirely impossible.) But under normal circumstances such a \ndivision does not occur; describing a familiar situation is, for the \nspeaker, an event in which statement and phenomenon are firmly \nglued together. \nThis unity is the result of a process of learning that starts in one's \nchildhood. From our very early days we learn to react to situations \nwith the appropriate responses, linguistic or otherwise. The teaching \nprocedures both shape the 'appearance', or 'phenomenon', and \nestablish a firm conneaion with words, so that finally the phenomena \nseem to speak for themselves without outside help or extraneous \nknowledge. They are what the associated statements assert them to \nbe. The language they 'speak' is, of course, influenced by the beliefs \nof earlier generations which have been held for so long that they no \nlonger appear as separate principles, but enter the terms of everyday \ndiscourse, and, after the prescribed training, seem to emerge from \nthe things themselves. \nAt this point we may want to compare, in our imagination and quite \nabstractly, the results of the teaching of different languages \nincorporating different ideologies. We may even want consciously to \nchange some of these ideologies and adapt them to more 'modem' \npoints of view. It is very difficult to say how this will alter our situation, \nunless we make the further assumption that the quality and structure \nof sensations (perceptions), or at least the quality and structure of \nthose sensations which enter the body of science, is independent of \ntheir linguistic expression. I am very doubtful about even the \napproximate validity of this assumption, which can be refuted by \nSlDlple examples, and I am sure that we are depriving ourselves of \nnew and surprising discoveries as long as we remain within the limits \ndefined by it.

The first view is that of Kant, and, in a very different manner \nand on the basis of very different talents, that of some contemporary \nlinguistic philosophers. The second view is due to Bacon (who had \npredecessors, however, such as the Greek sceptics). \nGalileo is one of those rare thinkers who wants neither forever to \nretain natural interpretations nor altogether to eliminate them. \nWholesale judgements of this kind are quite alien to his way of \nthinking. He insists upon a critical discussion to decide which natural \ninterpretations can be kept and which must be replaced. This is not \nalways clear from his writings. Quite the contrary. The methods of \nreminiscence, to which he appeals so freely, are designed to create \nthe impression that nothing has changed and that we continue \nexpressing our observations in old and familiar ways. Yet his attitude \nis relatively easy to ascertain: natural interpretations are necessary. \nThe senses alone, without the help of reason, cannot give us a true \naccount of nature. What is needed for arriving at such a true account \nare 'the . . .  senses, accompanied by reasoninj.6 Moreover, in the \narguments dealing with the motion of the earth, it is this reasoning, it \nis the connotation of the observation terms and not the message of the \nsenses or the appearance that causes trouble. 'It is, therefore, better \nto put aside the appearance, on which we all agree, and to use the \npower of reason either to confirm its reality or to reveal its fallacy.'7 \nConfirming the reality or revealing the fallacy of appearances means, \nhowever, examining the validity of those natural interpretations \nwhich are so intimately connected with the appearances that we no \nlonger regard them as separate assumptions. I now tum to the first \nnatural interpretation implicit in the argument from falling stones. \nAccording to the Copernican view as presupposed in the tower \nargument the motion of a falling stone should be 'mixed straight­\nand-circular'.8 By the 'motion of the stone' is meant not its motion \nrelative to some visible mark in the visual field of the observer, or its \n5.

The familiar facts appealed to in \nthe argument present a different kind of motion, a simple vertical \nmotion. This refutes the Copernican hypothesis only if the concept \nof motion that occurs in the observation statement is the same as the \nconcept of motion that occurs in the Copernican prediction. The \nobservation statement 'the stone is falling straight down' must, \ntherefore, refer to a movement in (absolute) space. It must refer to a \nreal motion. \nNow, the force of an 'argument from observation' derives from the \nfact that the observation statements involved are firmly connected \nwith appearances. There is no use appealing to observation if one \ndoes not know how to describe what one sees, or if one can offer one's \ndescription with hesitation only, as if one had just learned the \nlanguage in which it is formulated. Producing an observation \nstatement, then, consists of two very different psychological events: \n(1) a clear and unambiguous sensation and (2) a clear and \nunambiguous conneaion between this sensation and parts of a \nlanguage. This is the way in which the sensation is made to speak.

Of course, this distinction is not explicitly drawn. \nOne does not first distinguish the apparent motion from the real \nmotion and then connect the two by a correspondence rule. One \nrather describes, perceives, acts towards motion as if it were already \nthe real thing. Nor does one proceed in this manner under all \ncircumstances. It is admitted that objects may move which are not \nseen to move; and it is also admitted that certain motions are illusory \n(cf. the example of the moon mentioned earlier in this chapter). \nApparent motion and real motion are not always identified. However, \n1ere are paradigmatic cases in which it is psychologically very difficult, \nIf not plainly impossible, to admit deception. It is from these \nparadigmatic cases, and not from the exceptions, that naive realism \n0th respect to motion derives its strength.

The motion of the \nstone in the tower argument, or the alleged motion of the earth, is \nsuch a paradigmatic case. How could one possibly be unaware of the \nswift motion of a large bulk of matter such as the earth is supposed to \nbe! How could one possibly be unaware of the fact that the falling \nstone traces a vastly extended trajectory through space! From the \npoint of view of 17th-century thought and language, the argument is, \ntherefore, impeccable and quite forceful. However, notice how \ntheories ('operative character' of all motion; essential correctness of \nsense reports) which are not formulated explicitly, enter the debate in \nthe guise of observable events. We realize again that such events are \nTrojan horses which must be watched most carefully. How is one \nsupposed to proceed in such a sticky situation? \nThe argument from falling stones seems to refute the Copernican \nview. This may be due to an inherent disadvantage ofCopemicanism; \nbut it may also be due to the presence of natural interpretations which \nare in need of improvement. The first task, then, is to discuver and to \nisolate these unexamined obstacles to progress. \nIt was Bacon's belief that natural interpretations could be \ndiscovered by a method of analysis that peels them off, one after \nanother, until the sensory core of every observation is laid bare. This \nmethod has serious drawbacks. First, natural interpretations of the \nkind considered by Bacon are not just added to a previously existing \nfield of sensations. They are instrumental in constituting the field, as \nBacon says himself. Eliminate all natural interpretations, and you \nalso eliminate the ability to think and to perceive. Second, \ndisregarding this fundamental function of natural interpretations, it \nshould be clear that a person who faces a perceptual field without a \nsingle natural interpretation at his disposal would be completely \ndisoriented, he could not even start the business of science. The fact \nthat we do start, even after some Baconian analysis, therefore shows \nthat the analysis has stopped prematurely. It has stopped at precisely \nthose natural interpretations of which we are not aware and without \nwhich we cannot proceed. It follows that the intention to start from \nscratch, after a complete removal of all natural interpretations, is self­\ndefeating. \nFurthermore, it is not possible even partly to unravel the cluster of \nnatural interpretations. At first sight the task would seem to be simple \nenough. One takes observation statements, one after the other, and \nanalyses their content. However, concepts that are hidden · in \nobservation statements are not likely to reveal themselves in the more \nabstract parts of language.

Perceptions must \nbe identified, and the identifying mechanism will contain some of the \nvery same elements which govern the use of the concept to be \ninvestigated. We never penetrate this concept completely, for we \nalways use part of it in the attempt to find its constituents. There is \nonly one way to get out of this circle, and it consists in using an \nexternal measure of comparison, including new ways of relating concepts \nand percepts. Removed from the domain of natural discourse and \nfrom all those principles, habits, and attitudes which constitute its \nform oflife, such an external measure will look strange indeed. This, \nhowever, is not an argument against its use. On the contrary, such an \nimpression of strangeness reveals that natural interpretations are at \nwork, and is a first step towards their discovery. Let us explain this \nsituation with the help of the tower example. \nThe example is intended to show that the Copernican view is not in \naccordance with 'the facts'.

Turning the argument around, we \nfirst assert the motion of the earth and then inquire what changes will \nremove the contradiction. Such an inquiry may take considerable \ntime, and there is a good sense in which it is not finished even today. \nThe contradiction may stay with us for decades or even centuries. \nStill, it must be upheld until we have finished our examination or else \nthe examination, the attempt to discover the antediluvian com­\nponents of our knowledge, cannot even start. This, we have seen, is \n?ne of the reasons one can give for retaining, and, perhaps, even for \n˶rroenting, theories which are inconsistent with the facts. Ideological \nIngredients of our knowledge and, more especially, of our \nobservations are discovered with the help of theories which are \nrefuted by them. They are discuvered counterinduaively. \nLet me repeat what has been asserted so far. Theories are tested, \nand possibly refuted, by facts.

In the event of a contradiction between a new \nand interesting theory and a collection of firmly established facts, the \nbest procedure, therefore, is not to abandon the theory but to use it to \ndiscover the hidden principles responsible for the contradiction. \nCounterinduction is an essential part of such a process of discovery. \n(Excellent historical example: the arguments against motion and \natomicity of Parmenides and Zeno.

In general, the \nobservation language which enters an argument has been in use for a \nlong time and is quite familiar. Considering the structure of common \nidioms on the one hand, and of the Aristotelian philosophy on the \nother, neither this use nor this familiarity can be regarded as a test of \nthe underlying principles. These principles, these natural interpreta­\ntions, occur in every description. Extraordinary cases which might \ncreate difficulties are defused with the help of 'adjustor words', 11 \nsuch as 'like' or 'analogous', which divert them so that the basic \nontology remains unchallenged. A test is, however, urgently needed. \nIt is especially needed in those cases where the principles seem to \nthreaten a new theory. It is then quite reasonable to introduce \nalternative observation languages and to compare them both with the \noriginal idiom and with the theory under examination. Proceeding in \nI 0. Dialogue, op. cit., p. 171. Galileo's kinematic relativism is not consistent. In the \npassage quoted, he proposes the view (I) that shared motion has no 4/ect whatsoever. \n'Motion,' he says, 'in so far as it is and acts as motion, to that extent exists relatively to \nthings that lack it; and among things which all share equally in any motion, it does not \nact and is as if it did not exist' (p. 1 1 6); 'Whatever motion comes to be attributed to the \nearth must necessarily remain imperceptible . . .  so long as we look only at terrestrial \nobjects' (p. 1 14); ' . . .  motion that is common to many moving things is idle and \ninconsequential to the relation of those movables among themselves . . .' (p. 1 16). On \nthe other hand, (2) he also suggests that 'nothing . . .  muves in a straight line by nature. \nThe motion of aU celestial objects is in a circle; ships, coaches, horses, birds, aU move \nin a circle around the earth; the motions of the parts of animals are all circular; in sum­\nwe are forced to assume that only gravia deorsum and levia sursum move apparently in a \nstraight line; but even that is not certain as long as it has not been proven that the earth \nis at rest' (p. 1 9). Now, if (2) is adopted, then the loose parts of systems moving in a \nstraight line will tend to describe circular paths, thus contradicting (I). It is this \ninconsistency which has prompted me to split Galileo's argument into two steps, one \ndealing with the relativity of motion (only relative motion is noticed), the other dealing \nwith inertial laws (and only inertial motion leaves the relation between the parts of a system \nunaffected- assuming, of course, that neighbouring inertial motions are approximately \nparallel). For the two steps of the argument, see the next chapter. One must also realize \nthat accepting relativity of motion for inertial paths means giving up the impetus theory, \nwhich provides an (inner) cause for motions and therefore assumes an absolute space \nin which this cause becomes manifest. This Galileo seems to have done by now, for his \nargument for the existence of'boundless' or 'perpetual' motions which he oudines on \npp. 147fT of the Dialogue appeals to motions which are neutral, i.e. neither natural nor \nforced, and which may therefore (?) be assumed to go on for ever. \n> I .

Now ifl \nhad had that same pen continually in my hand, and had moved it only a \nlittle sometimes this way or that, what alterations should I have \nbrought into the main extent of this line? \nSimplicio: Less than that which would be given to a straight line a \nthousand yards long which deviated from absolute straightness here \nand there by a flea's eye. \nSagredo: Then if an artist had begun drawing with that pen on a \nsheet of paper when he left the port and had continued doing so all the \nway to Alexandretta, he would have been able to derive from the pen's \nmotion a whole narrative of many figures, completely traced and \nsketched in thousands of directions, with landscapes, buildings, \nanimals, and other things. Yet the actual real essential movement \nmarked by the pen point would have been only a line; long, indeed, \nbut very simple. But as to the artist's own actions, these would \nhave been conducted exactly the same as if the ship had been \nstanding still. The reason that of the pen's long motion no trace would \nremain except the marks drawn upon the paper is that the gross \nmotion from Venice to Alexandretta was common to the paper, the \npen, and everything else in the ship. But the small motions back and \nforth, to right and left, communicated by the artist's fingers to the pen \nbut not to the paper, and belonging to the former alone, could thereby \nleave a trace on the paper which remained stationary to those \nmotions.1 \nI .

One of them regards motion as an absolute \nprocess which always has effects, effects on our senses included. The \ndescription of this conceptual system given here may be somewhat \nidealized; but the arguments of Copernicus' opponents, which are \nquoted b/ Galileo himself and, according to him, are 'very \nplausible', show that there was a widespread tendency to think in its \nterms, and that this tendency was a serious obstacle to the discussion \nof alternative ideas. Occasionally, one finds even more primitive ways \nof thinking, where concepts such as 'up' and 'down' are used \nabsolutely. Examples are: the assertion 'that the earth is too hea1 to \nclimb up over the sun and then fall headlong back down again', or \nthe assertion that 'after a short time the mountains, sinking \ndownward with the rotation of the terrestrial globe, would get into \nsuch a position that whereas a little earlier one would have had to \nclimb steeply to their peaks, a few hours later one would have to stoop \nand descend in order to get there'. 9 Galileo, in his marginal notes, \ncalls these 'utterly childish reasons \u0013which] sufficed to keep imbeciles \nbelieving in the fixity of the earth'1 and he thinks it unnecessary 'to \nbother about such men as those, whose name is legion, or to take notice \nof their fooleries'. n Yet it is clear that the absolute idea of motion \nwas 'well-entrenched', and that the attempt to replace it was bound to \nencounter strong resistance. 12 \nopponent has a relative idea of motion, or frequently uses the relative idea in his \neveryday affairs, is not at all 'proof of inconsistency in his own \"paradigm\" ' \n(McMullin, op. cit., p. 40).

The generalization is only rarely regarded as a separate \nhypothesis, it rather enters the 'grammar' of common sense and gives the terms 'up' \nand 'down' an absolute meaning.

Naive realism with respect to motion is \nto be completely eliminated. \nNow, we have seen that this naive realism is on occasions an \nessential part of our observational vocabulary. On these occasions \n(Paradigm I), the observation language contains the idea of the \nefficacy of all motion.

The same use of language is presupposed by that 'mass of untutored \nmen' who raise the question why the antipodeans are not falling off the earth (Pliny, \nNatural History, 11, pp. 161-6, cf. also Ptolemy, Syntaxis, 1, 7). The attempts ofThales, \nAnaximenes and Xenophanes to find support for the earth which prevents it from \nfalling 'down' (Aristotle, De Coelo, 294al2ff) shows that almost al early philosophers, \nwith the sole exception of Anaximander, shared in this way of thinking. (For the \nAtomists, who assume that the atoms originally fall 'down,' cf. Jammer, Concepts of \nSpace, Cambridge, Mass., 1953, p. I I.) Even Galileo, who thoroughly ridicules the \nidea of the falling antipodes (Dialogue, op. cit., p. 33 1 ), occasionally speaks of the \n'upper half of the moon', meaning that part of the moon 'which is invisible to us'. And \nlet us not forget that some linguistic philosophers of today 'who are too stupid to \nrecognize their own limitations' (Galileo, op. cit., p. 327) want to revive the absolute \nmeaning of 'up-down' at least locally. Thus the power over the minds of his \ncontemporaries of a primitive conceptual frame, assuming an anisotropic world, which \nGalileo had also to fight, must not be underestimated. For an examination of some \naspects of British common sense at the time of Galileo, including astronomical \ncommon sense, see E.M.W.

Taking this into consideration, it is apparent \nthat Galileo's proposal amounts to a partial revision of our \nobservation language or of our experience. An experience which \npartly contradias the idea of the motion of the earth is turned into an \nexperience that confirms it, at least as far as 'terrestrial things' are \nconcerned.13 This is what actually happens. But Galileo wants to \npersuade us that no change has taken place, that the second \nconceptual system is already universally known, even though it is not \nuniversally used. Salviati, his representative in the Dialogue, his \nopponent Simplicio and Sagredo the intelligent layman all connect \nGalileo's method of argumentation with Plato's theory of anamnesis ­\na clever tactical move, typically Galilean one is inclined to say. Yet we \nmust not allow ourselves to be deceived about the revolutionary \ndevelopment that is actually taking place. \nThe resistance against the assumption that shared motion is non­\noperative was equated with the resistance which forgotten ideas \nexhibit towards the attempt to make them known. Let us accept this \ninterpretation of the resistance! But let us not forget its existence. We \nmust then admit that it restricts the use of the relativistic ideas, \nconfining them to part of our everyday experience. Outside this part, \ni.e. in interplanetary space, they are 'forgotten' and therefore not \nactive. But outside this part there is not complete chaos. Other \nconcepts are used, among them whose very same absolutistic \nconcepts which derive from the first paradigm. We not only use them, \nwe must also admit that they are entirely adequate. No difficulties \narise as long as one remains within the limits of the first paradigm. \n'Experience', i.e. the totality of all facts from all domains, cannot \nforce us to carry out the change which Galileo wants to introduce. \nThe motive for a change must come from a different source. \nIt comes, first, from the desire to see 'the whole [correspond] to its \nparts with wonderful simplicity', 14 as Copernicus had already \n13.

The idea of the motion of the earth is closer \nto the first paradigm than to the second, or at least it was at the time of \nGalileo. This gave strength to the Aristotelian arguments, and made \nthem plausible. To eliminate the plausibility, it was necessary to \nsubsume the first paradigm under the second, and to extend the \nrelative notions to all phenomena. The idea of anamnesis functions \nhere as a psychological crutch, as a lever which smooths the process \nof subsumption by concealing its existence.

These methods of concealment start with Galileo's attempt \nto introduce new ideas under the cover of anamnesis, and they \nculminate in Newton. 16 They must be exposed if we want to arrive at \na better account of the progressive elements in science. \nMy discussion of the anti-Copernican argument is not yet \ncomplete. So far, I have tried to discover what assumption will make a \nstone that muves alongside a muving tower appear to fall 'straight down', \ninstead of being seen to move in an arc. The assumption, which I \nshall call the relativity principle, that our senses notice only relative \nmotion and are insensitive to a motion which objects have in common \nwas seen to do the trick. What remains to be explained is why the stone \nstays with the tower and is not left behind. In order to save the \nCopernican view, one must explain not only why a motion that \npreserves the relation among visible objects remains unnoticed, but \nalso, why a common motion of various objects does not affect their \nrelation. That is, one must explain why such a motion is not a causal \nagent. Turning the question around in the manner explained in the \ntext to footnote 10, page 63 of the last chapter, it is now apparent \nthat the anti-Copernican argument described there rests on two \nnatural interpretations: viz, the epistemological assumption that \nabsolute motion is always noticed, and the dynamical principle that \nobjects (such as the falling stone) which are not interfered with \nassume their natural motion. For Aristotelians the natural motion of \nan object not interfered with is rest, i.e. constancy of qualities and \nof position. 17 This corresponds to our own experience where things \nhave to be pushed around to move. The discovery of seeds, bacteria, \nviruses would have been impossible without a firm belief in the \nqualitative part of the law - and it confirmed it in a most impressive \nway. Using this law scientists inferred that a stone dropped from a \ntower situated on a moving earth would be left behind. Thus the \nrelativity principle must be combined with a new law ofinertia in such \na fashion that the motion of the earth can still be asserted. One sees at \nonce that the following law, the principle of circular inertia as I shall call \nit, provides the required solution: an object that moves with a given \nangular velocity on a frictionless sphere around the centre of the \nearth will continue moving with the same angular velocity for ever. \n16.

The first was by \nshowing how it helps Copernicus: this defence is ad hoc but not \nobjectionable, because necessary for revealing natural interpreta­\ntions. The second was by pointing to its function in common sense, \nand by surreptitiously generalizing that function (see above). No \nindependent argument was given for its validity. Galileo' s support for \nthe principle of circular inertia is of exactly the same kind. He \nintroduces the principle, again not by reference to experiment or to \nindependent observation, but by reference to what everyone is \nalready supposed to know. \nSimplicio: So you have not made a hundred tests, or even one? And \nyet you so freely declare it to be certain? . . .  \nSalviati: Without experiment, I am sure that the effect will happen \nas I tell you, because it must happen that way; and I might add that you \nyourself also know that it cannot happen otherwise, no matter how you \nmay pretend not to know it . . . .  But I am so handy at picking people's \nbrains that I shall make you confess this in spite of yourself. 19 \nStep by step, Simplicio is forced to admit that a body that moves, \nwithout friction, on a sphere concentric with the centre of the earth \n18. These assumptions were not at all a matter of course, but conflicted with some \nvery basic ideas of Aristotelian physics. The principle of circular inertia is related to the \nimpetus theory, but not identical with it. The impetus theory retains the idea that it \nneeds a force to bring about change, but it puts the force inside the changing object. \nOnce pushed, an object continues moving in the same way in which a heated object \nstays warm -both contain the cause of their new state. Galileo modifies this idea in two \nways. First, the circular motion is supposed to go on forever while an object kept \nmoving by impetus will gradually slow down, just as a heated object, its analogue, \ngradually becomes colder. The argument for this modification is given in the text \nbelow; it is purely rhetorical. Secondly, the eternal circular motions must proceed \nwithout a cause: if relative motions are not operative, then introducing a motion with \nthe same centre and the same angular velocity as a circular motion upheld by impetus \ncannot eliminate forces: we are on the way from impetus to momentum (cf. A. Maier, \nDie Vorliufer Ga/i/eis im 14. Jahrhundert, Rome, 1949). All these changes are \noverlooked by those who assume that the transition was the simple result of a new and \nbetter dynamics and that the dynamics was already available, but had not yet been \napplied in a determined way. \n19.

We know, of \ncourse, especially after the analysis we have just completed of the \nnon-operative character of shared motion, that what Simplicio \naccepts is based neither on experiment nor on corroborated theory. It \nis a daring new suggestion involving a tremendous leap of the \nimagination. 20 A little more analysis then shows that this suggestion \nis connected with experiments, such as the 'experiments' of the \nDiscorsi21 by ad hoc hypotheses. (The amount of friction to be \neliminated follows not from independent investigations - such \ninvestigations commence only much later, in the 18th century - but \nfrom the result to be achieved, viz. the circular law of inertia.) \nViewing natural phenomena in this way leads to a re-evaluation of all \nexperience, as we have seen. We can now add that it leads to the \ninvention of a new kind of experience that is not only more sophisticated \nbut also far more speculative than the experience of Aristotle or of \n20. For a Copernican the only leap involved was the identification of the earth as a \ncelestial object. According to Aristotle celestial objects move in circles and 'a body that \nmoves in a circle has neither heaviness nor lightness for it cannot change its distance \nfrom the centre, neither in a natural nor in a forced way'. De Coelo, 269b34f. \n21. Incidentally, many of the 'experiences' or 'experiments' used in the arguments \nabout the motion of the earth are entirely fictitious. Thus Galileo, in his Trattato della \nSfera (Opere, Vol. II, pp. 21 Iff), which 'follows the opinion of Aristotle and of Ptolemy' \n(p. 223), uses this argument against a rotation of the earth: ' . . .  objects which one lets \nfall from high places to the ground such as a stone from the top of a tower would not fall \ntowards the foot of that tower; for during the time which the stone coming rectilinearly \ntowards the ground, spends in the air, the earth, escaping it, and moving towards the \neast would receive it in a part far removed from the foot of the tower in aactly the same \nmanner in which a stone that is droped from the mast of a rapidly muving ship will not fall \ntowards its foot, but more towards the stem' (p. 224). The italicized reference to the \nbehaviour of stones on ships is again used in the Dialogue (p. 126), when the Ptolemaic \narguments are discussed, but it is no longer accepted as correct. 'It seems to be an \nappropriate time,' says Salviati (ibid., p. 180), 'to take notice of a certain generosity on \nthe part of the Copernicans towards their adversaries when, with perhaps too much \nliberality, they concede as true and correct a number of experiments which their \nopponents have never made. Such for example is that of the body falling from the mast \nof a ship while it is in motion . . . .  ' Earlier, p. 154, it is implied rather than observed, that \nthe stone will fall to the foot of the mast, even if the ship should be in motion while a \npossible experiment is discussed on p. 186. Bruno (La Cma dele Ceneri, Opere /taliane, \nI, ed. Giovanni Gentile, Bari, 1907, p. 83) takes it for granted that the stone will arrive \nat the foot of the mast. It should be noted that the problem did not readily lend itself to \nan experimental solution. Experiments were made, but their results were far from \nconclusive. Cf. A. Armitage, 'The Deviation of Falling Bodies', Annals of Science, 5, \n1941-7, pp. 342fT, and A. Koyre, Metaphysics and Measurement, Cambridge, 1968, pp. \n89fT. The tower argument can be found in Aristotle, De Coelo, 296b22, and Ptolemy, \nSyntaxis, i, 8. Copernicus discusses it in the same chapter of De RtvOI, but tries to \ndefuse it in the next chapter. Its role in the Middle Ages is described in M. Clagett, The \nScience of Mechanics in theMiddleAges, Madison, 1959, Chapter 10. \n",

It \nis by means of such an experience that the transition from a geostatic \ncosmoloPr to the point of view of Copernicus and Kepler is \nachieved. 2 \n22. Alan Chalmers, in an interesting and well-argued paper ('The Galileo That \nFeyerabend Missed: An Improved Case Against Method' in j.A. Schuster and R.R. \nYeo (eds), The Politics and Rhetoric of Scientific Method, Dordrecht, 1986, pp. Iff), \ndistinguishes 'between Galileo's contributions to a new science, on the one hand, and \nthe question of the social conditions in which that science is developed and practised, \non the other', admits that 'propaganda' (though much less than I suggest) may have \nbeen part of his attempt to change the latter, but emphasizes that it does not affect the \nformer. 'The main source for Galileo's contribution to science itself', says Chalmers, \n'is his Two New Sciences'. This is the work I should have studied to explore Galileo's \nprocedure. But the Two New Sciences do not deal with the topic I was discussing, viz. the \ntransition to Copernicus. Here Galileo used procedures rather different from those of \nhis later work. Lynn Thorndike, who shares Chalmers' evaluation of the Dialogue, \nwished that Galileo had written a systematic textbook on that subject (A History of \nMagic and Experimental Science, Vol. 6, New York, 1941, pp. 7 and 62: 'Galileo might \nhave done better to write a systematic textbook than his provocative dialogues'). Now \nfor such a textbook to have substance it would have to be as general as its Aristotelian \nrival and it would have to show how and why Aristotelian concepts needed to be \nreplaced at the most elementary level. Aristotelian concepts, though abstract, were \nclosely related to common sense. Hence it was necessary to replace some common \nnotions by others (I am now speaking about what Chalmers calls 'perceptual relativity' \n-p. 7). Two questions arise: how big were the changes? and was propaganda (rhetoric, \nwere 'irrational moves') needed to carry them out? My answer to the latter question is \nthat discourse attempting to bring about major conceptual changes is a normal part of \nscience, common sense, and cultural exchange (for the latter cf. Chapter 16 and \nChapter 17, item vi, 'open exchange'), and that it differs from the discourse carried out \nwithin a more or less stable framework. Personally, I am quite prepared to make it part \nof rationality. But there exist philosophical schools that oppose it or call it incoherent \n(cf. Chapter 10 of Farewell to Reason which discusses some of Hilary Putnam's views). \nUsing the terminology of these schools I speak of Galileo's 'trickery', etc. And I add that \nscience contains ingredients that occasionally need such 'trickery' to become \nacceptable. The difference between the Sciences and the Dialogue, therefore, is not \nbetween science and sociology but between technical changes in a narrow field and \nbasic changes, realistically interpreted. My answer to the first question is that \nperceptual relativity, though acknowledged by many scholars (and by Aristotle \nhimself), was not a common possession ( Galileo points out that even some of his fellow \nscientists stumbled at this point) and thus had to be argued for. This is not at all \nsurprising, as my discussion of qualitative difficulties in Chapter 5 shows. Besides, is it \nreally true that a traveller on a boat sees the harbour as receding as if it were removed \nby some strange force? I conclude that Galileo's 'trickery' was necessary for a proper \nunderstanding of the new cosmology, that it is 'trickery' only for philosophies that set \nnarrow conditions on conceptual change and that it should be extended to areas still \nrestricted by such conditions (in Chapter 12 1 argue that the mind-body problem is one \nsuch area). \n",

However, he offers no theoretical \nreasons why the telescope should be expeaed to give a true piaure of the sky. \nI repeat and summarize. An argument is proposed that refutes \nCopernicus by observation. The argument is inverted in order to \ndiscover the natural interpretations which are responsible for the \ncontradiction. The offensive interpretations are replaced by others, \npropaganda and appeal to distant, and highly theoretical, parts of \ncommon sense are used to defuse old habits and to enthrone new \nones. The new natural interpretations, which are also formulated \nexplicitly, as auxiliary hypotheses, are established partly by the \nsupport they give to Copernicus and partly by plausibility considera­\ntions and ad hoc hypotheses. An entirely new 'experience' arises in \nthis way. There is as yet no independent evidence, but this is no \ndrawback; it takes time to assemble facts that favour a new \ncosmology. For what is needed is a new dynamics that explains both \ncelestial and terrestrial motions, a theory of solid objects, aero­\ndynamics, and all these sciences are still hidden in the future.1 But \ntheir task is now well-defined, for Galileo's assumptions, his ad hoc \nhypotheses included, are sufficiently clear and simple to prescribe \nthe direction of future research. \nLet it be noted, incidentally, that Galileo's procedure drastically \nreduces the content of dynamics. Aristotelian dynamics was a general \nI. Galileo's circular law is not the right dynamics. It fits neither the epicycles \nwhich still occur in Copernicus, nor Kepler's ellipses. ln fact, it is refuted by both. Still, \nGalileo regards it as an essential ingredient of the Copernican point of view and tries to \nČemove bodies, such as comets, whose motion quite obviously is not circular, from \ntnterplanetary space.

Other \nkinds of motion are pushed aside with the promissory note (due to \nDemocritos) that locomotion will eventually be capable of explaining \nall motion. Thus a comprehensive empirical theory is replaced by a \nnarrow theory plus a metaphysics of motion,2 just as an 'empirical' \nexperience is replaced by an experience that contains speculative \nelements. Counterinduaion, however, is now seen to play an important \nrole both vis-a-vis theories and vis-a-vis facts. It clearly aids the \nadvancement of science.

The so-called scientific revolution led to astounding discoveries and \nconsiderably extended our knowledge of physics, physiology, and astronomy. This was \nachieved by pushing aside and regarding as irrelevant, and often as non-aistent, those \nfacts which had supported the older philosophy. Thus the evidence for witchcraft, \ndemonic possession, the existence of the devil, etc., was disregarded together with the \n'superstitions' it once confirmed. The result was that 'towards the close of the Middle \nAges science was forced away from human psychology, so that even the great \nendeavour of Erasmus and his friend Vives, as the best representatives of humanism, \ndid not suffice to bring about a reapproachment, and psychopathology had to trail \ncenturies behind the developmental trend of general medicine and surgery. As a \nmatter of fact . . .  the divorcement of medical science from psychopathology was so \ndefinite that the latter was always totally relegated to the domain of theology and \necclesiastic and civil law - two fields which naturally became further and further \nremoved from medicine . . . .  ' G. Zilboorg, MD, The Medical Man and the Witch, \nBaltimore, 1935, pp. 3fT and 70fT. Astronomy advanced, but the knowledge of the \nhuman mind slipped back into an earlier and more primitive stage. Another example is \nastrology. 'In the early stages of the human mind,' writes A. Comte (Cours de \nPhilosophie Positive, Vol. Ill, pp. 273-80, ed. Littre, Paris, 1836), 'these connecting \nlinks between astronomy and biology were studied from a very different point of view, \nbut at /east they were studied and not left out of sight, as is the common tendency in our \nown time, under the restricting influence of a nascent and incomplete positivism. \nBeneath the chimerical belief of the old philosophy in the physiological influence of \nthe stars, there lay a strong, though confused recognition of the truth that the facts of \nlife were in some way dependent on the solar system. Like all primitive inspirations of \nman's intelligence this feeling needed rectification by positive science, but not \ndestruction; though unhappily in science, as in politics, it is often hard to reorganize \nwithout some brief period of overthrow.' A third area is mathematics. Aristotle had \ndeveloped a highly sophisticated theory of the continuum that overcame the \ndifficulties raised by Zeno and anticipated quantum theoretical ideas on motion (see \nfootnote I 5 and text of Chapter 5). Most physicists returned to the idea of a continuum \nconsisting of indivisible elements - if they considered such recondite matters, that is. \n",

Nor can I ever sufficiently \nadmire the outstanding acumen of those who have taken hold of this \nopinion and accepted it as true: they have, through sheer force of \nintellect, done such violence to their own senses as to prefer what \nreason told them over that which sensible experience plainly showed \nthem to be the contrary.

But the experiences which overtly contradict \nthe annual movement [the movement of the earth around the sun] are \nindeed so much greater in their apparent force that, I repeat, \nthere is no limit to my astonishment when I reflect that Aristarchus \nand Copernicus were able to make reason so conquer sense that \nin defiance of the latter, the former became mistress of their belief.;:; \nA little later Galileo notes that 'they \u0012the Copernicans] were \nconfident of what their reason told them!' And he concludes his \nbrief account of the origins of Copernicanism by saying that 'with \nreason as his guide he [Copernicus] resolutely continued to affirm \nwhat sensible experience seemed to contradict'.

Replying to an adversary who had raised the issue of \nCopernicanism he remarks that 'neither Tycho, nor other astronomers \nnor even Copernicus could clearly refute [Ptolemy] inasmuch as a most \nimportant argument taken from the movement of Mars and Venus \nstood always in their way'. (This 'argument' is mentioned again in the \nDialogue, and has just been quoted.) He concludes that 'the two \nsystems' (the Copernican and the Ptolemaic) are 'surely false'.8 \nWe see that Galileo's view of the origin of Copernicanism differs \nmarkedly from the more familiar historical accounts. He neither \npoints to new facts which offer inductive support to the idea of the \nmoving earth, nor does he mention any observations that would refute \nthe geocentric point of view but be accounted for by Copernicanism. \nOn the contrary, he emphasizes that not only Ptolemy, but \nCopernicus as well, is refuted by the facts, 9 and he praises \nAristarchus and Copernicus for not having given up in the face of \n7. ibid., p. 334. \n8.

Galileo, after all, invented a new dynamics. And he \ninvented the telescope. The new dynamics, one might want to point \nout, removes the inconsistency between the motion of the earth and \nthe 'conditions affecting ourselves and those in the air above us'. 10 And \nthe telescope removes the 'even more glaring' clash between the \nchanges in the apparent brightness of Mars and Venus as predicted on \nthe basis of the Copernican scheme and as seen with the naked eye. \nThis, incidentally, is also Galileo's own view. He admits that 'were it \nnot for the existence of a superior and better sense than natural and \ncommon sense to join forces with reason' he would have been 'much \nmore recalcitrant towards the Copernican system' .1 1 The 'superior \nand better sense' is, of course, the telescope, and one is inclined to \nremark that the apparently counterinductive procedure was as a \nmatter of fact induction (or conjecture plus refutation plus new \nconjecture), but one based on a better expen·ence, containing not only \nbetter natural interpretations but also a better sensory core than was \navailable to Galileo's Aristotelian predecessors. 12 This matter must \nnow be examined in some detail. \nThe telescope is a 'superior and better sense' that gives new and \nmore reliable evidence for judging astronomical matters.

But the particular reason he gives - his insight into the theory of \nrefraction - is not correa and is not sufficient either. \nThe reason is not correct, for there exist serious doubts as to \nGalileo's knowledge of those parts of contemporary physical optics \nwhich were relevant for the understanding of telescopic phenomena. \nIn a letter to Giuliano de Medici of 1 October 1610,1 Ʊ more than \nhalf a year after publication of the Sidereus Nuncius, he asks for a copy \nof Kepler's Optics of 1604(5 pointing out that he had not yet been \nable to obtain it in Italy.

Hoppe, who sums up the situation as \nfollows: \nGalileo's assertion that having heard of the Dutch telescope he \nreconstructed the apparatus by mathematical calculation must of \ncourse be understood with a grain of salt; for in his writings we do not \nfind any calculations and the report, by letter, which he gives of his \nfirst effort says that no better lenses had been available; six days later \nwe find him on the way to Venice with a better piece to hand it as a gift \nto the Doge Leonardi Donati. This does not look like calculation; it \nrather looks like trial and error. The calculation may well have been of \na different kind, and here it succeeded, for on 25 August 1609 his \nsalary was increased by a factor of three. 20 \nTrial and error - this means that 'in the case of the telescope it was \nexperience and not mathematics that led Galileo to a serene faith in the \nreliability of his device'.21 This second hypothesis on the origin of \nthe telescope is also supported by Galileo's testimony, in which he \nwrites that he had tested the telescope 'a hundred thousand times on \na hundred thousand stars and other objects'. 22 Such tests produced \ngreat and surprising successes. The contemporary literature -\nletters, books, gossip columns - testifies to the extraordinary \nimpression which the telescope made as a means of improving \nterestrial vision. \noptical matters, he 'refrained from attempting to construct the device'. 'You, however,' \nhe addresses Galileo, 'deserve my praise. Putting aside all misgivings you turned \ndirectly to visual experimentation' (Conversation, op. cit., p. 1 8). It remains to add that \nGalileo, due to his lack of knowledge in optics, had no 'misgivings' to overcome: \n'Galileo . . .  was totally ignorant of the science of optics, and it is not too bold to assume \nthat this was a most happy accident both for him and for humanity at large', Ronchi, \nScientific Change, ed. Crombie, London, 1963, p. 550. \n20. Die Geschichte der Optik, Leipzig, 1926, p. 32. Hoppe's judgement concerning \nthe invention of the telescope is shared by Wolf, Zinner and others.

    "chunk_full": "84 \nA G A INST METHOD \nJulius Caesar Lagalla, Professor of Philosophy in Rome, describes \na meeting of 16 April 161 1, at which Galileo demonstrated his \ndevice: 'We were on top of the janiculum, near the city gate named \nafter the Holy Ghost, where once is said to have stood the villa \nof the poet Martial, now the property of the Most Reverend Malvasia. \nBy means of this instrument, we saw the palace of the most illus­\ntrious Duke Altemps on the Tuscan Hills so distinctly that we \nreadily counted its each and every window, even the smallest; \nand the distance is sixteen Italian miles. From the same place \nwe read the letters on the gallery, which Sixtus erected in the Lateran \nfor the benedictions, so clearly, that we distinguished even the \nperiods carved between the letters, at a distance of at least two \nmiles.'23 \nOther reports confirm this and similar events. Galileo himself \npoints to the 'number and importance of the benefits which the \ninstrument may be expected to confer, when used by land or sea'.24 \n23. Legalla, De phaenomenis in orbe lunae nooi telescopii usa a D. Galileo Galilei nunc \niterum suscitatis physica disputatio (Venice, 1612), p. 8; quoted from E. Rosen, The \nNaming of the Telescope, New York, 1947, pl. 54. The regular reports (;tvvist) of the \nDuchy of Urbino on events and gossip in Rome contain the following notice of the \nevent: 'Galileo Galilei the mathematician, arrived here from Florence before Easter. \nFormerly a Professor at Padua, he is at present retained by the Grand Duke of \nTuscany at a salary of I ,00 scudi. He has observed the motion of the stars with the \nociali, which he invented or rather improved. Against the opinion of all ancient \nphilosophers, he declares that there are four more stars or planets, which are satellites \nof Jupiter and which he calls the Medicean bodies, as well as two companions of \nSaturn. He has here discussed this opinion of his with Father Clavius, the Jesuit. \nThursday evening, at Monsignor Malavasia's estate outside the St Pancratius gate, a \nhigh and open place, a banquet was given for him by Frederick Cesi, the marquis of \nMonticelli and nephew of Cardinal Cesi, who was accompanied by his kinsman, Paul \nMonaldesco. In the gathering there were Galileo; a Fleming named Terrentius; \nPersio, of Cardinal Cesi's retinue, [La] Galla, Professor at the University here; the \nGreek, who is Cardinal Gonzaga's mathematician; Piffari, Professor at Siena, and as \nmany as eight others. Some of them went out expressly to perform this observation, \nand even though they stayed until one o'clock in the morning, they still did not reach an \nagreement in their views' (quoted from Rosen, op. cit., p. 3 1  ). \n24. Sidereal Messenger, op. cit., p. ii. According to Berellus (De Vero Tekscopii \nlrromtore, Hague, 1655, p. 4), Prince Moritz immediately realized the military value of \nthe telescope and ordered that its invention - which Berellus attributes to Zacharias \nJansen - be kept a secret. Thus the telescope seems to have commenced as a secret \nweapon and was turned to astronomical use only later. There are many anticipations of \nthe telescope to be found in the literature, but they mostly belong to the domain of \nnatural magic and are used accordingly. An example is Agrippa von Nettesheim, who, \nin his book on occult philosophy (written 1509, Book II, chapter 23), writes 'et ego novi \nex illis miranda conficere, et specula in quibus quis videre poterit quaecunque voluerit \na longissima distantia'. 'So may the toy of one age come to be the precious treasure of \nanother', Henry Morley, The Lift of Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, Vol. II, p. 166. \n",

The \nfirst telescopic observations of the sky are indistinct, indeterminate, \ncontradictory and in conflict with what everyone can see with his unaided \neyes. And the only theory that could have helped to separate telescopic \nillusions from veridical phenomena was refuted by simple tests. \nTo start with, there is the problem of telescopic vision. This problem \nis different for celestial and terrestrial objects; and it was also thought \nto be different in the two cases. 1 \nIt was thought to be different because of the contemporary idea \nthat celestial objects and terrestrial objects are formed from dif­\nferent materials and obey different laws. This idea entails that \nthe result of an interaction of light (which connects both domains \nand has special properties) with terrestrial objects cannot, without \nfurther discussion, be extended to the sky. To this physical idea \none added, entirely in accordance with the Aristotelian theory \nof knowledge (and also with present views about the matter), the \nidea that the senses are acquainted with the close appearance of \nterrestrial objects and are, therefore, able to perceive them distinctly, \neven if the telescopic image should be vastly distorted, or disfigured \nby coloured fringes. The stars are not known from close by.2 Hence \nwe cannot in their case use our memory for separating the \ncontributions of the telescope and those which come from the object \n1. This is hardly ever realized by those who argue (with Kastner, op. cit., p. 133) \nthat 'one does not see how a telescope can be good and useful on the earth and yet \ndeceive in the sky'. Kastner's comment is directed against Horky. See below, text to \nfootnotes 9-16 of the present chapter. \n2. That the senses are acquainted with our everyday surroundings, but are liable \nto give misleading reports about objects outside this domain, is proved at once by \nthe appearance of the moon. On the earth large but distant objects in familiar surround­\nings, such as mountains, are seen as being large, and far away. The appearance \nof the moon, however, gives us an entirely false idea of its distance and its \nsize. \n86 \n",

About a year earlier, on 24 and 25 April l610, \nGalileo had taken his telescope to the house of his opponent, Magini, \nin Bologna to demonstrate it to twenty-four professors of all faculties. \nHorky, Kepler's overly-excited pupil, wrote on this occasion;8 'I never \nslept on the 24th or 25th April, dał or night, but I tested the instrument \nof Galileo's in a thousand ways, both on things here below and on \nthose above.

This silenced Galileo and on the 26th he \nsadly left quite early in the morning . . .  not even thanking Magini for \nhis splendid meal. . . .  ' Magini wrote to Kepler on 26 May: 'He has \nachieved nothing, for more than twenty learned men were present; yet \nnobody has seen the new planets distinctly (nemo perfecte vidit); he \nwill hardly be able to keep them.'1 1 A few months later (in a letter \nsigned by Ruffini) he repeats: 'Only some with sharp vision were \nconvinced to some extent.'12 After these and other negative reports \nhad reached Kepler from all sides, like a paper avalanche, he asked \nGalileo for witnesses: 13 'I do not want to hide it from you that quite a \nfew Italians have sent letters to Prague asserting that they could not see \nthose stars [the moons ofjupiter] with your own telescope. I ask myself \nhow it can be that so many deny the phenomenon, including those who \nuse a telescope. Now, if I consider what occasionally happens to me, \nthen I do not at all regard it as impossible that a single person may see \nwhat thousands are unable to see . . . .  14 Yet I regret that the \n8.

David Lindberg, 'The \"Perspectiva \nCommunis\" of John Pecham',Archives lnternalionales d'histoiredes sciences, 1965, p. 51, \nas well as the last paragraph of Proposition iV19 of Pecham's Perspectiva Communis, \nwhich is to be found in John Pecham and the Science of Optics, D.

I \nstil remember my disappointment when, having built a reflector with an alleged linear \nmagnification of about ISO, I found that the moon was only about five times enlarged, \nand situated quite close to the ocular (1937). \n20. The image remains sharp and unchanged over a considerable interval - the \nlack of focusing may show itself in a doubling, however. \n21. The first usable telescope which Kepler received from Elector Ernst of Koln \n(who in tum had received it from Galileo), and on which he based his Narratio de \nobservatis a se quartuor Juvis satellibw, Frankfurt, 161 1, showed the stars as squares and \nintensely coloured (Ges. Werke, IV, p. 461). Ernst von Koln himself was unable to se \nanything with the telescope and he asked Clavius to send him a better instrument \nflrchivio della Pontifica Universita GrtgOriana, 530, f 182r). Francesco Fontana, who \nfrom 1643 onwards observed the phases of Venus, notes an unevenness of the \nboundary (and infers mountains), cf. R. Wolf, Geschichte der Astronomie, Munich, 1877, \np. 398.

Professor McMullin (op. cit., footnote 32) makes \nmuch of this quick acceptance of Galileo's telescopic observations: 'The regular \nperiods observed for the satellites and for the phases of Venus strongly indicated that \nthey were not artefacts of physiology or optics. There was surely no need for \"auxiliary \nsciences\" . . .  ' 'There was no need for auxiliary sciences,' writes McMullin, while using \nhimself the unexamined auxiliary hypothesis that astronomical events are distin­\nguished from physiological events by their regularity and their intersubjectivity. But \nthis hypothesis is foise, as is shown by the moon illusion, the phenomenon of fata \nmorgana, the rainbow, haloes, by the many microscopic illusions which are so vividly \ndescribed by Tolansky, by the phenomena of witchcraft which survive in our textboks \nof psychology and psychiatry, though under a different name, and by numerous other \nphenomena. The hypothesis was also kno8m to be folse by Pecham, Witelo, and other \nmediaeval scholars who had studied the regular and intersubjective 'illusions' created \nby lenses, mirrors, and other optical contrivances. In antiquity the falsehood of \nMcMullin's hypothesis was commonplace. Galileo explicitly discusses and repudiates it \nin his book on comets. Thus a new theory of vision was needed, not just to acapt the \nGalilean observations, but also to provide arguments for their astronomical reality. Of \ncourse, Clavius may not have been aware of this need. This is hardly surprising. After \nal, some of his sophisticated 20th-century successors, such as Professor McMullin, \nare not aware of it either. In addition we must point out that the 'regular periods' of the \nmoons of Jupiter were not as well known as McMullin insinuates. For his whole life \nGalileo tried to determine these periods in order to find better ways of determining \nlongitude at sea. He did not succeed. Later on the same problem returned in a \ndifferent form when the attempt to determine the velocity of light with more than one \nmoon led to conflicting results. This was found by Cassini shordy after Roemer's \ndiscovery - cf. I.B. Cohen, 'Roemer and the first determination of the velocity of light \n(1676)', /sis, Vol. 31 (1940), pp. 347fT. For the attitude ofCiavius and the scientists of \nthe Collegium Romanum cf. the very interesting book Galileo in China by Pasquale M. \nd'Elia, S.J., Cambridge, Mass., 1960.

The reply is contained in the following \nquotation (Werke, II, pp. 194fl): 'When eclipses of the moon begin, I, who suffer from \nthis defect, become aware of the eclipse before all the other observers. Long before the \neclipse starts, I even detect the direction from which the shadow is approaching, while \nthe others, who have very acute vision, are still in doubt . . . .  The afore-mentioned \nwaviness of the moon [cf. the previous quotation] stops for me when the moon \napproaches the shadow, and the strongest part of the sun's rays is cut off . . .  .' Galileo \nhas two explanations for the contradictory appearance of the moon. The one involves a \nlunar atmosphere (Messenger, op. cit., pp. 26fl). The other explanation (ibid., pp. 25fl), \nwhich involves the tangential appearance of series of mountains lying behind each \nother, is not really very plausible as the distribution of mountains near the visible side \nof the lunar globe does not show the arrangement that would be needed (this is now \neven better established by the publication of the Russian moon photograph of 7 \nOctober 1959; cf. Zdenek Kopal, An lntroduaion to the Study of the Moon, North \nHolland, 1966, p. 242). \n25. The librations were noticed by Galileo. C. G. Righini, 'New Light on Galileo's \nLunar Observations', in M.L Righini-Bonelli and R. Shea (eds), Reason, Experinla \nand Mysticism in the Scientific RtvOiution, New York, 1975, pp. 59fT. Thus it was not \nsloppiness of observations but the phenomena themselves that misguided Galileo. \nIn two letters to the journal Science (2 May and 10 October 1980) T.H. Whitaker \naccused me of giving a misleading account ofGalileo's observational skill- I called him \na por observer when his lunar observations were in fact rather impressive. The \naccusation is refuted by the text to footnotes 29 and 30 and by footnote 46 of the \npresent chapter. Whitaker obviously thought my quotations from Wolf (text to \nfootnote 28) reflected my own opinion. He also points out that the copperplates of \nGalileo's observations are much better, from a modem point of view, than the \nwoodcuts which accompanied the Nuncius. This is true but does not invalidate my \ndescription of the debate which was based on the published account. \n26.

Later on, the different magnification of planets (or \ncomets) and fixed stars was used as a means of distinguishing them. 'From experience, \nI know', writes Herschel in the paper reporting his first observation of Uranus (Phil \nTrans., 11, 1 78 1 ,  pp. 493ft- the planet is here identified as a comet), 'that the diameters \nof the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as the planets \nare; therefore, I now put on the powers of 460 and 932, and found the diameter of the \ncomet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be . . . .  ' It is noteworthy that \nthe rule did not invariably apply to the telescopes in use at Galileo's time. Thus, \ncommenting on a comet of November 1618, Horatio Grassi ('On the Three Comets of \n1618', in The Contruversy oft he Comets of 1618, op. cit., p. 17) points out 'that when the \ncomet was observed through a telescope it suffered scarcely any enlargement', and he \ninfers, perfectly in accordance with Herschel's 'experience', that 'it wil have to be said \nthat it is more remote from us than the moon . . . .  ' In his Astronomical Balance (ibid., p. \n80) he repeats that, according to the common experience of'illustrious astronomers' \nfrom 'many parts of Europe' the comet observed with a very extended telescope \nreceived scarcely any increment. . . . Galileo (ibid., p. 177) accepts this as a fact, \ncriticizing only the conclusions which Grassi wants to draw from it. Al these \nphenomena refute Galileo's assertion (Assayer, op. cit., p. 204) that the telescope \n'works always in the same way'. They also undermine his theory of irradiation (cf. \nfootnote 56 to this chapter). \n27. Kopal, op. cit., p. 207. \n28. R. Wolf (Geschichte der Astronomie, p. 396) remarks on the por quality of \nGalileo's drawings of the moon (' . . .  seine Abbildung des Mondes kann man . . .  kaum \n· · · eine Karte nennen'), while Zinner ( Geschichte der Sternkuruk, Berlin, 193 1 ,  p. 4 73) \ncalls Galileo's observations of the moon and Venus 'typical for the observations of a \nbeginner'. His picture of the moon, according to Zinner, 'has no similarity with the \nǣoon' (ibid., p. 472). Zinner also mentions the much better quality of the almost \nstmultaneous observations made by the Jesuits (ibid., p. 473), and he finally asks \nwhether Galileo's observations of the moon and Venus were not the result of a fertile \n\u0011rain, rather than of a careful eye ('sollte dabei . . . der Wunsch der Vater der \n+obachtung gewesen sein?') - a pertinent question, especially in view of the \nP enomena briefly described in footnote 34 to this chapter. \n29 · The discovery and identification of the moons of jupiter were no mean achieve­\nments, especially as a useful stable support for the telescope had not yet been developed. \n",

Interpreted in this way Galileo's drawings are reports \nof exactly the same kind as are the reports emerpng from \nthe experiments of Stratton, Ehrismann, and Kohler3 - except \nthat the characteristics of the physical apparatus and the un­\nfamiliarity of the objects seen must be taken into account too. 32 \nWe must also remember the many conflicting views which were \nheld about the surface of the moon, even at Galileo's time,33 \nand which may have influenced what observers saw. 34 What would \nbe needed in order to shed more light on the matter is an em­\npirical collection of all the early telescopic results, preferably \nin parallel columns, including whatever pictorial representations \n30. The reason, among other things, is the great variation of telescopic vision from \none observer to the next, cf. Ronchi, Optics, op. cit., Chapter IV. \n31. For a survey and some introductory literature cf. Gregory, op. cit., Chapter 11. \nFor a more detailed discussion and literature cf. K.W. Smith and W.M.

I have been considering it, with varying degrees of \nenthusiasm, for the last two or three years and my interest in it has \nbeen revived by a letter from Professor Stephen Toulmin, to whom I \nam grateful for his clear and simple presentation of the view. lt seems \nto me, however, that the hypothesis is confronted by many difficulties \nand must, perhaps, be given up. \nHypothesis II, just like Hypothesis I, approaches telescopic \nreports from the point of view of the theory of perception; but it adds \nthat the practice of telescopic observation and acquaintance with the \nnew telescopic reports changed not only what was seen through the \ntelescope, but also what was seen with the naked eye. It is obviously of \nimportance for our evaluation of the contemporary attitude towards \nGalileo's reports. \nThat the appearance of the stars, and of the moon, may at some \ntime have been much more indefinite than it is today was originally \nsuggested to me by the existence of various theories about the moon \nwhich are incompatible with what everyone can plainly see with his \nown eyes. Anaximander's theory of partial stoppage (which aimed to \nexplain the phases of the moon), Xenophanes' belief in the existence \nof different suns and different moons for different zones of the earth, \nHeraclitus' assumption that eclipses and phases are caused by the \ntumin:fi of the basins, which for him represented the sun and the \nmoon \n- all these views run counter to the existence of a stable and \nplainly visible surface, a 'face' such as we 'know' the moon to possess. \nThe same is true of the theory of Berossos which occurs as late as \nLucretius38 and, even later, in Alhazen. \n35. Chapter 15 of Kopal, op. cit., contains an interesting collection of exacdy this \nkind. Wider scope has W. Schulz, Die Anschauung vom Montie und seinen Gestalten in \nMythos und Kunst der VOlker, Berlin, 1912. \n36. One must, of course, also investigate the dependence of what is seen on the \ncurrent methods of pictorial representation. Outside astronomy this was done by E. \nGombrich,Art and Illusion, London, 1960, and L. Choulant,A History and Bibliography \nof Anatomical Illustration, New York, 1945 (translated, with additions, by Singer and \nothers), who deals with anatomy.

Having been influenced by Wittgenstein, Hanson, \nand others, I was for some time inclined towards the second version, \nbut it now seems to me that it is ruled out both by physiology \n(psychology)39 and by historical information. We need only \nremember how Copernicus disregarded the difficulties arising from \nthe variations in the brightness of Mars and Venus, which were well \nknown at the time.40 And as regards the face of the moon, we see \nthat Aristotle refers to it quite clearly when observing that 'the stars \ndo not roll. For rolling involves rotation: but the \"face\", as it is called, \nof the moon is always seen.'41 We may infer, then, that the \noccasional disregard for the stability of the face was due not to a lack \nof clear impressions, but to some widely held views about the \nunreliability of the senses. The inference is supported by Plutarch's \ndiscussion of the matter which plainly deals not with what is seen \n(except as evidence for or against certain views) but with certain \nexplanations of phenomena otherwise assumed to be well /mown: 42 'To \nbegin with,' he says, 'it is absurd to call the figure seen in the moon an \naffection of vision . . .  a condition which we call bedazzlement (glare). \nAnyone who asserts this does not observe that this phenomenon \nshould rather have occurred in relation to the sun, since the sun lights \nupon us keen and violent, and moreover does not explain why dull \nand weak eyes discern no distinction of shape in the moon but her orb \nfor them has an even and full light whereas those ofkeen and robust \nmay revolve upon herself I like to a ball's sphere -if perchance to be -I one half of her \ndyed o'er with glowing light I and by the revolution of that sphere I she may beget for \nus her varying shapes I until she turns that fiery part of her I full to the sight and open \neyes ofmen . . . .

Aristode, \nwho must have been familiar with all these facts, does not mention them anywhere in \nDe Coelo or in the Mdaphysics, though he gives an account of Eudoxos' system and of \nthe improvements of Polemarchus and Kalippus.

Later on the stability of the face is \nused as an argument against theories which regard the moon as being \nmade of fire, or air, for 'air is tenuous and without configuration, and \nso it naturally slips and does not stay in place'. 44 The appearance of \nthe moon, then, seemed to be a well-known and distinct \nphenomenon. What was in question was the relevance of the \nphenomenon for astronomical theory. \nWe can safely assume that the same was true at the time of \nGalileo.45 \nBut then we must admit that Ga/ileo 's observations could be checked with \nthe naked eye and could in this way be exposed as illusory. \nThus the circular monster below the centre of the disk of the \nmoon 46 is well above the threshold of naked eye observation (its \n43. ibid., cf. however, footnote 17 to this chapter, Pliny's remark (Hist.

A strong argument in favour of this contention is Kepler's description of the \nmoon in his Optics of 1604: he comments on the broken character of the boundary \nbetween light and shadow (Werke, II, p. 218) and describes the dark part of the moon \nduring an eclipse as looking like tom flesh or broken wood (ibid., p. 219). He returns to \nthese passages in the COtTVmation (op. cit., p. 27), where he tells Galileo that 'these \nvery acute observations of yours do not lack the support of even my own testimony. For \n[in my] Optics you have the halfmoon divided by a wavy line. From this fact I deduced \npeaks and depressions in the body of the moon. [Later on] I describe the moon during \nan eclipse as looking like tom flesh or broken wood, with bright streaks penetrating into \nthe region of the shadow.' Remember also that Kepler criticizes Galileo's telescopic \nreports on the basis ofhis own naked eye observations; cf. footnote 24 of this chapter. \n46.

It would be interestin.p to see what \ncontemporary observers had to say on the matter4 or, if they were \nartists, what they had to draw on the matter. \nI summarize what has emerged so far. \nGalileo was only slightly acquainted with contemporary optical \ntheory.48 His telescope gave surprising results on the earth, and \nthese results were duly praised. Trouble was to be expected in the \nsky, as we know now. Trouble promptly arose: the telescope \nproduced spurious and contradictory phenomena and some of its \nresults could be refuted by a simple look with the unaided eye. Only a \nnew theory of telescopic vision could bring order into the chaos \n(which may have been still larger, due to the different phenomena \nseen at the time even with the naked eye) and could separate \nappearance from reality. Such a theory was developed by Kepler, first \nin 1604 and then again in 161 1 .49 \nAccording to Kepler, the place of the image of a punctiform object \nis found by first tracing the path of the rays emerging from the object \naccording to the laws of (reflection and) refraction until they reach \nthe eye, and by then using the principle (still taught today) that 'the \nimage will be seen in the point determined by the backward \nseen bathed in sunlight before the boundary between light and shade reaches half way \nacross the circular space . . . ' (Messenger, op. cit., pp. 21ff). This description, I think, \ndefinitely refutes Kopal's conjecture of observational laxity. It is interesting to note the \ndifference between the woodcuts in the Nuncius (p. 131, Figure 0 and Galileo's \noriginal drawing. The woodcut corresponds quite closely to the description while the \noriginal drawing with its impressionistic features (' Kaum eine Karte,' says Wolf) is \nvague enough to escape the accusation of gross observational error. \n47. 'I cannot help wondering about the meaning of that large circular cavity in \nwhat I usually call the left comer of the mouth,' writes Kepler (Conversation, op. cit., p. \n28), and then proceeds to make conjectures as to its origin (conscious efforts by \nintelligent beings included). \n48. Contemporary academic optics went beyond simple geometrical constructions \n(which Galileo may have known) and included an account of what is seen when looking at \na mirror, or through a lens, or a combination oflenses. Excepting irradiation Galileo \nnowhere considers the properties of telescopic vision. Aristotelians writing after \nGalileo's telescopic observations did. Cf. Redondi, op. cit., pp.l69ff. \n49. I have here disregarded the work of della Porta (De Refractione) and of \nMaurolycus who both anticipated Kepler in certain respects (and are duly mentioned \nby him). Maurolycus makes the important step [Photismi de Lumine, transl. Henry \nCrew, New York, 1940, p. 45 (on mirrors) and p. 74 (on lenses)) of considering only \nthe cusp of the caustic; but a connection with what is seen on direct vision is stil not \nestablished.

Whatever the optical system, whatever the \ntotal path of the rays from the object to the observer, the rule says that \nthe mind of the observer utilizes its very last part only and bases its \nvisual judgement, the perception, on it. \nThe rule considerably simplified the science of optics. However, it \nneeds only a second to show that it is false: take a magnifying glass, \ndetermine its focus, and look at an object close to it. The telemetric \ntriangle now reaches beyond the object to infinity. A slight change of \ndistance brings the Keplerian image from infinity to close by and \nback to infinity. No such phenomenon is ever observed. We see the \nimage, slightly enlarged, in a distance that is most of the time \nidentical with the actual distance between the object and the lens. \nThe visual distance of the image remains constant, however much we \nmay vary the distance between lens and object and even when the \nimage becomes distorted and, finally, diffuse. 55 \n50.

The \nanswer has already been given: he raised the telescope to the state \nof a 'superior and better sense'. 56 What were his reasons for doing \nwhich was responsible for the slow advance of a scientific theory of eye glasses and of \nvisual optics in general. 'The reason for this peculiar phenomenon,' writes Moritz von \nRohr (Das Brillenglas als optisches lmtrument, Berlin, 1934, p. 1 ), 'is to be sought in the \nclose connection between the eye glass and the eye and it is imposible to give an \nacceptable theory of eye glasses without understanding what happens in the process of \nvision itself . . . .  ' The telemetric triangle omits precisely this process, or rather gives a \nsimplistic and false account of it. The state of optics at the beginning of the 20th \ncentury is well described in A. Gullstrand's 'Appendices to Part I' of Helmholtz's \nTreatise on Physiological Optics, transl. Southall, New York, 1962, pp. 261fT. We read \nhere how a return to the psycho-physiological process of vision enabled physicists to \narrive at a more reasonable account even of the physics of optical imagery: 'The reason \nwhy the laws of actual optical imagery have been, so to speak, summoned to life by the \nrequirements of physiological optics is due partly to the fact that by means of \ntrigonometrical calculations, tedious to be sure, but easy to perform, it has been \npossible for the optical engineer to get closer to the realities of his problem. Thus, \nthanks to the labours of such men as Abbe and his school, technical optics has attained \nits present splendid development; whereas, with the scientific means available, a \ncomprehensive grasp of the intricate relations in the case of the imagery in the eye has \nbeen actually imposible.' \n56. '0 Nicholas Copernicus, what a pleasure it would have been for you to see this \npart of your system confirmed by so clear an experiment!' writes Galileo, implying that \nthe new telescopic phenomena are additional support for Copernicus (Dialogue, op. \ncit., p. 339). The difference in the appearance of planets and fixed stars (cf. footnote 26 \nto this chapter) he explains by the hypothesis that 'the very instrument of seeing [the \neye] introduces a hindrance of its own' (ibid., p. 335), and that the telescope removes \nthis hindrance, viz. irradiation, permitting the eye to see the stars and the planets as \nthey really are. (Mario Giuducci, a follower of Galileo, ascribed irradiation to \nrefraction by moisture on the surface of the eye, Discourse on the Comas of 1618, op. cit., \np. 47.) This explanation, plausible as it may seem (especially in view of Galileo's \nattempt to show how irradiation can be removed by means other than the telescope) is \nnot as straightforward as one might wish. Gullstrand (op. cit., p. 426) says that 'owing \nto the properties of the wave surface of the bundle of rays refracted in the eye . . .  it is a \nmathematical imposibility for any cros section to cut the caustic surface in a smooth \ncurve in the form of a circle concentric with the pupil'. Other authors point to \n'inhomogeneities in the various humours, and above al in the crystalline lens' (Ronchi, \nOptics, op. cit., p. 104). Kepler gives this account (Conversation, op. cit., pp. 33ff): \n'Point sources of light transmit their cones to the crystalline lens. There refraction \ntakes place, and behind the lens the cones again contract to a point. But this point does \nnot reach as far as the retina. Therefore, the light is dispersed once more, and spreads \nover a small area of retina, whereas it should impinge on a point. Hence the telescope, \nby introducing another refraction, makes this point coincide with the retina . . . .  ' \nP?lyak, in his classical work The Raina, attributes irradiation partly to 'defects of the \ndtoptrical media and to the imperfect accommodation' but 'chiefly' to the 'peculiar \nstructural constitution of the retina itself (p. 176), adding that it may be a function of \n<e brain also (p. 429). None of these hypotheses covers all the facts known about \n•rradiation. Gullstrand, Ronchi, and Polyak (if we omit his reference to the brain \n",

It is this rather peculiar situation, \nthis harmony between two interesting but refuted ideas, which \nGalileo exploits in order to prevent the elimination of either. \nExactly the same procedure is used to preserve his new dynamics. \nWe have seen that this science, too, was endangered by observable \nevents.

Copernicanism and \nother essential ingredients of modern science survived only because reason \nwas frequently uverruled in their past. \nA prevalent tendency in philosophical discussions is to approach \nproblems of knowledge sub specie aeternitatis, as it were. Statements \nare compared with each other without regard to their history and \nwithout considering that they might belong to different historical \nstrata. For example, one asks: given background knowledge, initial \nconditions, basic principles, accepted observations - what conclu­\nsions can we draw about a newly suggested hypothesis? The answers \nvary considerably. Some say that it is possible to determine degrees of \nconfirmation and that the hypothesis can be evaluated with their help. \nOthers reject any logic of confirmation and judge hypotheses by their \ncontent, and by the falsifications that have actually occurred. But \nalmost everyone takes it for granted that precise observations, clear \nprinciples and well-confirmed theories are already decisive; that they \ncan and must be used here and now to either eliminate the suggested \nhypothesis, or to make it acceptable, or perhaps even to prove it. \nSuch a procedure makes sense only if we can assume that the \nelements of our knowledge - the theories, the observations, the \nprinciples of our arguments - are timeless entities which share the \nsame degree of perfection, are all equally accessible, and are related \nto each other in a way that is independent of the events that produced \nthem. This is, of course, an extremely common assumption. It is \ntaken for granted by most logicians; it underlies the familiar \ndistinction between a context of discovery and a context of \njustification; and it is often expressed by saying that science deals \nwith propositions and not with statements or sentences.

And this is also the way in \nwhich Einstein discovered certain deep-lying assumptions of \nclassical mechanics, such as the assumption of the existence of \ninfinitely fast signals. For general considerations, cf. the last \nparagraph of Chapter 5.) Many of the conflicts and contradictions \nwhich occur in science are due to this heterogeneity of the material, \nto this 'unevenness' of the historical development, as a Marxist would \nsay, and they have no immediate theoretical significance. 1 They \nhave much in common with the problems which arise when a power \n1. According to Marx, 'secondary' parts of the social process, such as demand, \nartistic production or legal relations, may get ahead of material production and drag it \nalong: cf. The Puverty of Philosophy but especially the Introduction to the Critique of \nPolitical Economy, Chicago, 1918, p. 309: 'The unequal relation between the \ndevelopment of material production and art, for instance. In general, the conception of \nprogress is not to be taken in the sense of the usual abstraction. In the case of art, etc., it \nis not so important and difficult to understand this disproportion as in that of practical \nsocial relations, e.g. the relation between education in the U.S. and Europe. The really \ndifficult point, however, that is to be discussed here is that of the unequal development \nof relations of production as legal relations.' Trotsky describes the same situation: \n'The gist of the matter lies in this, that the different aspects of the historical progress ­\neconomics, politics, the state, the growth of the working class - do not develop \nsimultaneously along parallel lines' ('The School of Revolutionary Strategy', speech \ndelivered at the general party membership meeting of the Moscow Organization of \nJuly 1921, published in The First Five Years of the Communist International, Vol. II, New \nYork, 1953, p. 5). See also Lenin, Left- Wing Communism - an Infantile Disorder (op. \ncit., p. 59), concerning the fact that multiple causes of an event may be out of phase and \nhave an effect only when they occur together. In a different form, the thesis of'uneven \ndevelopment' deals with the fact that capitalism has reached different stages in \ndifferent countries, and even in different parts of the same country. This second type \nof uneven development may lead to inverse relations between the accompanying \nideologies, so that efficiency in production and radical political ideas develop in inverse \nproportions. 'In civilized Europe, with its highly developed machine industry, its rich, \nmultiform culture and its constitutions, a point of history has been reached when the \ncommanding bourgeoisie, fearing the growth and increasing strength of the \nproletariat, comes out in support of everything backward, moribund, and medieval. . . .  \nBut all young Asia grows a mighty democratic movement, spreading and gaining in \nstrength' (Lenin, 'Backward Europe and Advanced Asia', Collected Works, Vol. 19, op. \ncit., pp. 99fl). For this very interesting situation, which deserves to be exploited for the \nphilosophy of science, cf. A. C. Meyer, Leninism, Cambridge, 1957, Chapter 12 and L. \nAlthusser, For Mar.t, London and New York, 1970, Chapters 3 and 6.

But \nin most cases, and especially in the case observation vs theory, our \nmethodologies project the various elements of science and the \ndifferent historical strata they occupy on to one and the same plane, \nand proceed at once to render comparative judgements. This is like \narranging a fight between an infant and a grown man, and announcing \ntriumphantly, what is obvious anyway, that the man is going to win (the \nhistory of science is full of inane criticisms of this kind and so is the \nhistory of psychoanalysis and of Marxism). In our examination of new \nhypotheses we must obviously take the historical situation into \naccount. Let us see how this is going to affect our judgement! \nThe geocentric hypothesis and Aristotle's theory of knowledge \nand perception are well adapted to each other. Perception supports \nthe theory of locomotion that entails the unmoved earth and it is in \ntum a special case of a comprehensive view of motion that includes \nlocomotion, increase and decrease, qualitative alteration, generation \nand corruption. This comprehensive view defines motion as the \ntransition of a form from an agent to a patient which terminates when \nthe patient possesses exactly the same form that characterized the \nagent at the beginning of the interaction. Perception, accordingly, is a \nprocess in which the form of the object perceived enters the \npercipient as precisely the same form that characterized the object so \nthat the percipient, in a sense, assumes the properties of the object. \nA theory of perception of this kind (which one might regard as a \nsophisticated version of naive realism) does not permit any major \ndiscrepancy between observations and the things observed. 'That \nthere should be things in the world which are inaccessible to man not \nonly now, and for the time being, but in principle, and because of his \nnatural endowment, and which would therefore never be seen by him \n- this was quite inconceivable for later antiquity as well as for the \nMiddle Ages.'2 Nor does the theory encourage the use of \n2.

Anim., 644b26ff. In what follows, a highly idealized account is \ngiven oflater Aristotelianism. Unless otherwise stated, the word' Aristotle' refers to this \nidealization.

Such illusions can be readily demonstrated by examining \nthe images produced by curved mirrors, 3 or by crude lenses (and \nremember that the lenses used by Galileo were far from the level of \nperfection achieved today): they are distorted, the lens-images have \ncoloured fringes, they may appear at a place different from the place \nof the object and so on.

Such an analysis shows the inherent \npower of the Aristotelian system. \nThe role of observation in Aristotle is quite interesting. Aristotle is \nan empiricist. His injunctions against an overly-theoretical approach \nare as militant as those of the 'scientific' empiricists of the 17th and \n18th centuries. But while the latter take both the truth and the \ncontent of empiricism for granted, Aristotle explains the nature of \nexperience and why it is important. Experience is what a normal \nobserver (an observer whose senses are in good order and who is not \ndrunk or sleepy, etc.) perceives under normal circumstances (broad \ndaylight; no interference with the medium) and describes in an idiom \nthat fits the facts and can be understood by all. Experience is \nimportant for knowledge because, given normal circumstances, the \nperceptions of the observer contain identically the same forms that \nreside in the object. Nor are these explanations ad hoc. They are a \ndirect consequence of Aristotle's general theory of motion, taken in \nconjunction with the physiological idea that sensations obey the same \nphysical laws as does the rest of the universe. And they are confirmed \nby the evidence that confirms either of these two views (the existence \nof distorted lens-images being part of the evidence).

In the view of the Copernicans there exist large-scale \nprocesses which involve vast cosmic masses and yet leave no trace in \nour experience. The existent observations therefore count no longer \nas tests of the new basic laws that are being proposed. They are not \ndirectly attached to these laws, and they may be entirely discon­\nnected. Today, after the success of modem science led to the belief \nthat the relation between man and the universe is not as simple as is \nassumed by naive realism, we can say that this was a correct guess, \nthat the observer is indeed separated from the laws of the world by \nthe special physical conditions of his observation platform, the \nmoving earth (gravitational effects; law of inertia; Coriolis forces; \ninfluence of the atmosphere upon optical observations; aberration; \nstellar parallax; and so on . . .  ), by the idiosyncrasies of his basic \ninstrument of observation, the human eye (irradiation; after-images; \nmutual inhibition of adjacent retinal elements; and so on . . .  ) as well \nas by older views which have invaded the observation language and \nmade it speak the language of naive realism (natural interpretations). \nObservations may contain a contribution from the thing observed, \nbut this contribution merges with other effects (some of which we \nhave just mentioned), and it may be completely obliterated by them. \nJust consider the image of a fixed star as viewed through a telescope. \nThis image is displaced by the effects of refraction, aberration and, \npossibly, of gravitation. It contains the spectrum of the star not as it is \nnow, but as it was some time ago (in the case of extra-galactic \nsupernovae the difference may be millions of years), and distorted by \nDoppler effect, intervening galactic matter, etc. Moreover, the \nextension and the internal structure of the image is entirely \ndetermined by the telescope and the eyes of the observer: it is the \ntelescope that decides how large the diffraction disks are going to be, \nand it is the human eye that decides how much of the structure of \nthese disks is going to be seen. It needs considerable skill and much \ntheory to isolate the contribution of the original cause, the star, and to \nuse it for a test, but this means that non-Aristotelian cosmologies can \nbe tested only after we have separated observations and laws with the \nhelp of auxiliary sciences describing the complex processes that \noccur between the eye and the object, and the even more complex \nprocesses between the cornea and the brain.

In sum: what is needed for \na test of Copernicus is an entirely new world-view containing a new view of \nman and of his capacities of knowing. 4 \n4. Bacon realized that scientific change involves a reformation not only of a few \nideas, but of an entire world-view and, perhaps, of the very nature of humans. 'For the \nsenses are weak and erring', he writes in Nuvum Organum, Aphorism 50. 'For man's \nsense is falsely asserted to be the standard of things; on the contrary, all the \nperceptions, both of the senses and of the mind bear reference to man and not to the \nuniverse, and the human mind resembles those uneven mirrors which impart their \nown properties to different objects from which rays are emitted and distort and \ndisfigure them' (Aphorism 41). Bacon repeatedly comments on the 'dullness, \nincompetency and errors of the senses' (50) and permits them only to 'judge . . .  the \nexperiment' while it is the experiment that functions as a judge 'of nature and the thing \nitself (SO). Thus when Bacon speaks of the 'unprejudiced senses' he does not mean \nsense-data, or immediate impressions, but reactions of a sense organ that has been \nrebuilt in order to mirror nature in the right way. Research demands that the entire \nhuman bang be rebuilt. This idea of a physical and mental reform of humanity has \nreligious features. A 'demolishing branch' (1 15), an 'expiatory process', a 'purification \nof the mind' (69) must precede the accumulation of knowledge. 'Our only hope of \nsalvation is to begin the whole labour of the mind again' (Preface) hut only 'after having \ncleansed, polished, and levelled its surface' (1 15). Preconceived notions (36), opinions \n(42fl), even the most common words (59, 121) 'must be abjured and renounced with \nfinn and solemn resolution . . .  so that the access to the kingdom of man, which is \nfounded on the sciences, may resemble that to the kingdom of heaven, where no \nadmission is conceded except to children' (68). \nA reform of man is necessary for a correct science - hut it is not sufficient. Science, \naccording to Bacon, not only orders events, it is also supposed to give physical reasons. \nThus Ptolemy and Copernicus give us 'the number, situation, motion, and periods of \nthe stars, as a beautiful outside of the heavens, whilst the flesh and the entrails are \nwanting; that is, a well fabricated system, or the physical reasons and foundations for a \njust theory, that should not only solve phenomena, as almost any ingenious theory may \ndo, but show the substance, motions and influences of the heavenly bodies as they \nreally are.' Advancnent of Learning, Chapter 4, quoted from Wiley Boks, New York, \n1944, p. 85. Cf. also the Nuvum Organum, op. cit., p. 371 : 'For let no one hope to \ndetermine the question whether the earth or heaven revolve in the diurnal motion, \nunless he have first comprehended the nature of spontaneous motion': the new man \nneeds a new physics in order to give substance to his astronomy. Galileo did not \nsucceed in providing such a physics. \n",

It is extremely unlikely that the idea of the motion of the \nearth will at once be followed by the arrival, in full formal splendour, \nof all the sciences that are now said to constitute the body of'classical \nphysics'. Or, to be a little more realistic, such a sequence of events is \nnot only extremely unlikely, it is impossible in principle, given the \nnature of humans and the complexities of the world they inhabit. \nToday Copernicus, tomorrow Helmholtz - this is but a Utopian \ndream. Yet it is only after these sciences have arrived that a test can be \nsaid to make sense. \nThis need to wait, and to ignore large masses of critical \nobservations and measurements, is hardly ever discussed in our \nmethodologies. Disregarding the possibility that a new physics or a \nnew astronomy might have to be judged by a new theory ofknowledge \nand might require entirely new tests, empirically inclined scientists at \nonce confront it with the status quo and announce triumphantly that 'it \nis not in agreement with facts and received principles'. They are of \ncourse right, and even trivially so, but not in the sense intended by \nthem. For at an early stage of development the contradiction only \nindicates that the old and the new are diferent and out of phase. It does \nnot show which view is the bener one. A judgement of this kind \npresupposes that the competitors confront each other on equal \nterms. How shall we proceed in order to bring about such a fair \ncomparison? \nThe first step is clear: we must retain the new cosmology until it has \nbeen supplemented by the necessary auxiliary sciences. We must \nretain it in the face of plain and unambiguous refuting facts. We may, \nof course, try to explain our action by saying that the critical \nobservations are either not relevant or that they are illusory, but we \ncannot support such an explanation by a single objective reason. \nWhatever explanation we give is nothing but a verbal gesture, a gentle \ninvitation to participate in the development of the new philosophy. \nNor can we reasonably remove the received theory of perception \nwhich says that the observations are relevant, gives reasons for this \nassertion, and is confirmed by independent evidence. Thus the new \nview is arbitrarily separated from data that supported its predecessor \nScience-loving philosophers, including those who call themselves 'critical', are \nquick to criticize thinkers who do not share their pet ideas. Bacon was often criticized \nfor not at once falling for Copernicus. He was criticized for this unspeakable crime by \nphilosophers whose own 'rationalism' would never have allowed Copernicus to live. \nAn example is K.R.

This backward movement is not just an accident; \nit has a definite function; it is essential if we want to overtake the status \nquo, for it gives us the time and the freedom that are needed for \ndeveloping the main view in detail, and for finding the necessary \nauxiliary sciences. 5 \nThis backward movement is indeed essential - but how can we \npersuade people to follow our lead? How can we lure them away from \na well-defined, sophisticated and empirically successful system and \nmake them transfer their allegiance to an unfinished and absurd \nhypothesis? To a hypothesis, moreover, that is contradicted by one \nobservation after another if we only take the trouble to compare it \nwith what is plainly shown to be the case by our senses? How can we \nconvince them that the success of the status quo is only apparent and is \nbound to be shown as such in 500 years or more, when there is not a \nsingle argument on our side (and remember that the illustrations I \nused two paragraphs earlier derive their force from the successes of \nclassical physics and were not available to the Copemicans).6 It is \nclear that allegiance to the new ideas wil have to be brought about by \nmeans other than arguments. It will have to be brought about by \nirrational means such as propaganda, emotion, ad hoc hypotheses, and \nappeal to prejudices of all kinds. We need these 'irrational means' in \norder to uphold what is nothing but a blind faith until we have found \nthe auxiliary sciences, the facts, the arguments that tum the faith into \nsound 'knowledge'. \nIt is in this context that the rise of a new secular class with a new \noutlook and considerable contempt for the science of the schools, its \nmethods, its results, even for its language, becomes so important. \nThe barbaric Latin spoken by the scholars, the intellectual squalor of \nacademic science, its other-worldliness which is soon interpreted as \nuselessness, its connection with the Church - all these elements are \n5. An example of a backward movement of this kind is Galileo's return to the \nkinematics of the Commentariolus and his disregard for the machinery of epicycles as \ndeveloped in the De Revol. For an admirable rational account of this step cf. Imre \nLakatos and Eli Zahar, 'Why Did Copernicus' Research Programme Supersede \nPtolemy's?', in lmre Lakatos, Philosophical Papers Vol. I, Cambridge 1978. \n6.

Diogenes Laertius, IX, 84. However, it seems that the \nsceptical view had only little influence on the development of modem astronomy, and \nunderstandably so: one does not start a movement by being reasonable. \n",

For Copernicus \nnow stands for progress in other areas as well, he is a symbol for the \nideals of a new class that looks back to the classical times of Plato and \nCicero and forward to a free and pluralistic society. The association \nof astronomical ideas and historical and class tendencies does not \nproduce new arguments either. But it engenders a firm commitment \nto the heliocentric view - and this is all that is needed at this stage, as \nwe have seen. We have also seen how masterfully Galileo exploits the \nsituation and how he amplifies it by tricks, jokes, and non-sequiturs of \nhis own.8 \nWe are here dealing with a situation that must be analysed and \nunderstood if we want to adopt a more reasonable attitude towards \nthe issue between 'reason' and 'irrationality'. Reason grants that the \nideas which we introduce in order to expand and to improve our \n7. For these social pressures cf.

In a remarkable book, Galileo Heretic, Princeton, 1987 (first published, in \nItalian, in 1982), Pietro Redondi has described the groups both inside the Church (and \nincluding the Pope himself) and outside of it who looked favourably upon new \nscientific developments, the views on perception, continuity, matter and motion that \nhad been explained by Galileo in hisAssþeramong them. Being in direct conflict with \nthe traditional account of the Eucharist, the most important sacrament, these views \nwere considerably more dangerous than Copemicanism and could be tolerated only as \nlong as the groups and the Pope himself had the upper hand in the complex political \ndevelopments of the time (Thirty Years' War; French and Spanish politics; the French \nalliance with the Pope). The political reversal of the Pope's fortunes, the accusations of \nleniency towards heretics that were raised against him on political grmmds cast a \nshadow on his attitude towards scientific matters as well (here, too, he seemed to \nsupport heresy) and made protective measures necessary. Redondi tries to show (a) \nthat the physics of the time was connected with theological doctrines such as the \ndoctrine of the Eucharist and that a history of science that neglects the connection \nbecomes incomprehensible and (b) that the attitude towards scientific problems \ncaused by the connection and thus the attitude towards innovation changed with the \npolitical climate. The second part of (b) may well be true hut there is only weak \nevidence to support the rest: what Galileo says about atomism in the Assþer is much \ntoo brief and indefinite to conflict with transsubstantiation (it is an aside almost, not an \nelaborate statement) and with the exception of a rather problematic document no such \nconflict was perceived. (Cf. R.S. Westfall, Essþs on the Trial of Galileo, Vatican \nObservatory Publications, 1989, pp. 84fT.) What is valuable in Redondi's account is \nthat he widens the domain of possible influences and thus undermines the \n;anachronistic) belief that then as now scientific rationality was restricted to the \ntntemal problem situation of a scientific discipline. \n",

But it also demands that in judging such ideas we follow \ncertain well-defined rules: our evaluation of ideas must not be \ninvaded by irrational elements. Now, what our historical examples \nseem to show is this: there are situations when our most liberal \njudgements and our most liberal rules would have eliminated a point \nof view which we regard today as essential for science, and would not \nhave permitted it to prevail - and such situations occur quite \nfrequently. The ideas survived and they now are said to be in \nagreement with reason. They survived because prejudice, passion, \nconceit, errors, sheer pigheadedness, in short because all the \nelements that characterize the context of discovery, oposed the \ndictates of reason and because these irrational elements were permitted to \nhtlVe their way. To express it differently: Copernicanism and other \n'rational' views exist today only because reason was overruled at some time \nin their past. (The opposite is also true: witchcraft and other \n'irrational' views have ceased to be influential only because reason was \noverruled at some time in their past.)9 \nNow, assuming that Copernicanism is a Good Thing, we must also \nadmit that its survival is a Good Thing. And, considering the \nconditions of its survival, we must further admit that it was a Good \nThing that reason was overruled in the 16th, 17th and even the 18th \ncenturies. Moreover, the cosmologists of the 16th and 17th centuries \ndid not have the knowledge we have today, they did not know that \nCopernicanism was capable of giving rise to a scientific system that is \nacceptable from the point of view of'scientific method'. They did not \nknow which of the many views that existed at their time would lead to \nfuture reason when defended in an 'irrational' way. Being without \nsuch guidance they had to make a guess and in making this guess they \ncould only follow their inclinations, as we have seen. Hence it is \nadvisable to let one's inclinations go against reason in any circumstances, \nfor it makes life less constrained and science may profit from it. \n9. These considerations refute J. Dorling, who, in British Journal for the Philosophy \nof Science, Vol. 23, 1972. 189f, presents my 'irrationalism' as a presupposition of my \nresearch, not as a result. He continues: ' . . . one would have thought that the \nphilosopher of science would be most interested in picking out and analysing in detall \nthose scientific arguments which did seem to be rationaUy reconstructible.' One would \nhave thought that the philosopher of science would be most interested in picking out \nand analysing in detail those moves which are necessary for the advancement of science. \nSuch moves, I have tried to show, often resist rational reconstruction. \n",

If my account of Galileo is historically correct, then the \nargument stands as formulated. If it turns out to be a fairy-tale, then \nthis fairy-tale tells us that a conflict between reason and the \npreconditions of progress is possible, it indicates how it might arise, \nand it forces us to conclude that our chances to progress may be \nobstructed by our desire to be rational. And note that progress is here \ndefined as a rationalistic lover of science would define it, i.e. as \nentailing that Copernicus is better than Aristotle and Einstein better \nthan Newton. Of course, there is no need to accept this definition, \nwhich is certainly quite narrow. I use it only to show that an idea of \nreason accepted by the majority of rationalists may prevent progress \nas defined by the very same majority. I now resume the discussion of \nsome details of the transition from Aristotle to Copernicus. \nThe first step on the way to a new cosmology, I have said, is a step \nback: apparently relevant evidence is pushed aside, new data are \nbrought in by ad hoc connections, the empirical content of science is \ndrastically reduced. Now the cosmology that happens to be at the \ncentre of attention and whose adoption causes us to carry out the \nchanges just described differs from other views in one respect only: it \nhas features which at the time in question seem attractive to some \npeople. But there is hardly any idea that is totally without merit and \nthat might not also become the starting point of concentrated effort. \nNo invention is ever made in isolation, and no idea is, therefore, \ncompletely without (abstract or empirical) support. Now if partial \nsupport and partial plausibility suffice to start a new trend - and I \nhave suggested that they do - if starting a new trend means taking a \nstep back from the evidence, if any idea can become plausible and can \nreceive partial support, then the step back is in fact a step forward, \nand away from the tyranny of tightly-knit, highly corroborated, and \ngracelessly presented theoretical systems. 'Another different error', \nwrites Bacon on precisely this point, 10 'is the . . . peremptory \nreduction of knowledge into arts and methods, from which time the \nsciences are seldom improved; for as young men rarely grow in \nstature after their shape and limbs are fully formed, so knowledge, \nwhilst it lies in aphorisms and observations, remains in a growing \n10.

Once it has been realized that a close empirical fit is \nno virtue and that it must be relaxed in times of change, then style, \nelegance of expression, simplicity of presentation, tension of plot and \nnarrative, and seductiveness of content become important features of \nour knowledge. They give life to what is said and help us to overcome \nthe resistance of the observational material. 11 They create and \nmaintain interest in a theory that has been partly removed from the \nobservational plane and would be inferior to its rivals when judged by \nthe customary standards. It is in this context that much of Galileo's \nwork should be seen. This work has often been likened to \npropaganda12 - and propaganda it certainly is. But propaganda of this \nkind is not a marginal affair that surrounds allegedly more substantial \nmeans of defence, and that should perhaps be avoided by the \n'professionally honest scientist'. In the circumstances we are \nconsidering now, propaganda is of the essence. It is of the essence \nbecause interest must be created at a time when the usual \nmethodological prescriptions have no point of attack; and because \nthis interest must be maintained, perhaps for centuries, until new \nreasons arrive. It is also clear that such reasons, i.e. the appropriate \nauxiliary sciences, need not at once tum up in full formal splendour. \nThey may at first be quite inarticulate, and may even conflict with the \nexisting evidence.

Yet these false theories, these unacceptable \nphenomena, were transformed by Galileo and converted into strong \nsupport of Copernicus. The whole rich reservoir of the everyday \nexperience and of the intuition of his readers is utilized in the \nargument, but the facts which they are invited to recall are arranged \nin a new way, approximations are made, known effects are omitted, \ndifferent conceptual lines are drawn, so that a new kind of experience \narises, manufactured almost out of thin air. This new experience is \nthen solidified by insinuating that the reader has been familiar with it \nall the time. It is solidified and soon accepted as gospel truth, despite \nthe fact that its conceptual components are vastly more speculative \nthan are the conceptual components of common sense. Following \npositivistic usage we may therefore say that Galileo's science rests on \nan illustrated metaphysics. The distortion permits Galileo to advance, \nbut it prevents almost everyone else from making his effort the basis \nof a critical philosophy (for a long time emphasis was put either on his \nmathematics, or on his alleged experiments, or on his frequent appeal \nto the 'truth', and his propagandistic moves were altogether \nneglected). I suggest that what Galileo did was to let refuted theories \nsupport each other, that he built in this way a new world-view which \nwas only loosely (if at all!) connected with the preceding cosmology \n(everyday experience included), that he established fake connections \nwith the perceptual elements of this cosmology which are only now \nbeing replaced by genuine theories (physiological optics, theory of \ncontinua), and that whenever possible he replaced old facts by a new \ntype of experience which he simply invented for the purpose of \nsupporting Copernicus. Remember, incidentally, that Galileo's \nprocedure drastically reduces the content of dynamics: Aristotelian \ndynamics was a general theory of change comprising locomotion, \nqualitative change, generation and corruption. Galileo's dynamics \nand its successors deal with locomotion only, other kinds of motion \nbeing pushed aside with the promissory note (due to Democritos) \nthat locomotion will eventually be capable of comprehending all \nmotion. Thus, a comprehensive empirical theory of motion is \nreplaced by a much narrower theory plus a metaphysics of motion, \njust as an 'empirical' experience is replaced by an experience that \ncontains speculative elements. This, I suggest, was the actual \nprocedure followed by Galileo. Proceeding in this way he exhibited a \nstyle, a sense of humour, an elasticity and elegance, and an awareness \nof the valuable weaknesses of human thinking, which has never been \nequalled in the history of science.

It does not follow that it should be \nuniversally applied. \nGalileo made progress by changing familiar connections between \nwords and words (he introduced new concepts), words and \nimpressions (he introduced new natural interpretations), by using \nnew and unfamiliar principles such as his law of inertia and his \nprinciple of universal relativity, and by altering the sensory core of his \nobservation statements.

Its indiament ofGalileo was rational and \nonly opportunism and a lack of perspeaive can demand a revision. \nThere were many trials in the 17th century. The proceedings started \neither with accusations made by private parties, with an official act by \na public officer, or with an inquiry based on sometimes rather vague \nsuspicions. Depending on the location, the distribution of jurisdic­\ntion and the balance of power at a particular time, crimes might be \nexamined by secular courts such as the courts of kings or of free \ncities, by Church courts, such as the spiritual courts attached to every \nepiscopate, or by the special courts of the Inquisition. After the \nmiddle of the 12th century the episcopal courts were greatly aided by \nthe study of Roman law.

The surprised reader who \nasks what knowledge has to do with the law should remember the \nmany legal, social and financial obstacles knowledge-claims face \ntoday. Galileo wanted his ideas to replace the existing cosmology, but \nhe was forbidden to work towards that aim.

It had no special \nfeatures except perhaps that Galileo was treated rather mildly, \ndespite his lies and attempts at deception. 7 But a small clique of \nintellectuals aided by scandal-hungry writers succeeded in blowing it \nup to enormous dimensions so that what was basically an altercation \nbetween an expert and an institution defending a wider view of things \nnow looks almost like a battle between heaven and hell. This is \nchildish and also very unfair towards the many other victims of 17th­\ncentury justice. It is especially unfair towards Giordano Bruno, who \nwas burned but whom scientifically minded intellectuals prefer to \nforget. It is not a concern for humanity but rather party interests \nwhich play a major role in the Galileo hagiography. Let us therefore \ntake a closer look at the matter.8 \nThe so-called trial of Galileo consisted of two separate \nproceedings, or trials. The first occurred in 1616. The Copernican \ndoctrine was examined and criticized. Galileo received an order, but \nhe was not punished. The second trial took place in 1632/33. Here \nthe Copernican doctrine was no longer the point at issue. Rather, \nwhat was considered was the question of whether Galileo had obeyed \nthe order given him in the first trial, or whether he had deceived the \ninquisitors into believing that the order had never been issued. The \nproceedings of both trials were published by Antonio Favaro in Vol. \n19 of the National Edition of Galilean material. The suggestion, \nrather popular in the 19th century, that the proceedings contained \n7. An example is Galileo's reply to the inquiries of 12 April 1633: Maurice A. \nFinocchiaro, The Galileo A.foir, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1989, p. 262, the first two \nlines. The reaction of an admirer is characteristic: 'This absurd pretence . .  .' \nGeymonat, op. cit., p. 149. \n8. It cannot be denied that pressure groups, personal grievances, envy, the fact that \nGalileo, 'being too infatuated with his own genius' was 'unsufferable' (Westfall, op. \ncit., pp. 52, 38) and the rules of patronage played an important role as they, or similar \ncircumstances, do at every trial. However, the tensions between various groups of the \nChurch on the one side and the demands for scientific autonomy on the other were \nreal enough; after all, their modem successors (should the sciences be given the run of \nour educational institutions and of society as a whole or should they be treated like any \nother special interest group?) are still with us. Here the Church did the right thing: the \nsciences do not have the last word in humane matters, knowledge included. \nThe main documents pertaining to the trial were assembled and translated with \ncomments and an introduction by Finocchiaro, op. cit. I shall use his translations. \nAccounts of the trials and their problems are found in G. de Santillana, The Crime of \nGalileo, Chicago, 1954, Geymonat, op. cit., Redondi, op. cit., and, most recently, in \nWestfall. \n",

The \nInquisition started to examine the matter. Experts (qualificatores) \nwere ordered to give an opinion about two statements which \ncontained a more or less correct account of the Copernican \ndoctrine.10 Their decision1 1  concerned two points: what would \ntoday be called the scientific content of the doctrine and its ethical \n(social) implications. \nOn the first point the experts declared the doctrine to be 'foolish \nand absurd in philosophy' or, to use modem terms, they declared it to \nbe unscientific. This judgement was made without reference to the \nfaith, or to Church doctrine, but was based exclusively on the \nscientific situation of the time. It was shared by many outstanding \nscientists (Tycho Brahe having been one of them) \n- and it was \ncorrea12 when based on the facts, the theories and the standards of \n9. One of the authors of the suggestion was the Galileo scholar Emil Wohlwill. His \nreasons, rather impressive at the time, are given in his Der lnquisitionsprouss des Galiko \nGalilei, Berlin, 1870. According to Wohlwill two documents of the proceedings, dated \n25 Feb. 1616 and 26 Feb. 1616 (Finocchiaro, op. cit., pp. 147f) are mutually \ncontradictory. The first advises Galileo to treat Copernicus as a mathematical model; \nshould he reject the advice, then he is forbidden to mention Copernicus in any form \nwhatsoever. In the second document Galileo is advised as above and immediately \nforbidden (i.e. without waiting for his reaction) to mention Copernicus. Wohlwill \nthought the second document to be a forgery. This seems now refuted. Cf. de \nSantillana, Chapter 13. Stillman Drake (appendix to Geymonat) devised a very \nintriguing hypothesis to explain the discrepancy. \nI 0. Some critics used idiosyncrasies in the formulation as proof of a lack of com­\nprehension on the part of the experts.

Returned to the early 17th \ncentury, these champions of rationality would have judged Galileo as the Aristotelians \njudged him then. Michelson, for example, would have been aghast at Galileo's attempt \nto get knowledge out of an instrument as little understood as the telescope and \nRutherford, who was never too happy about the theory of relativity, would have \nproduced one of his characteristic rude remarks. Salvador Luria, an outstanding \nmicrobiologist who favours theories decidable by 'clear-cut experimental step[s]', \nwould have relegated the debate to 'outfields of science' like 'sociology' and would \nhave stayed away from it (A Slot Machine, a Broken Test Tube, New York, 1985, pp. 1 15, \n1 19). For what Galileo suggested was no less than to regard as true a theory which had \nonly analogies in its favour and which suffered from numerous difficulties.

Compared with those facts, theories and standards the idea \nof the motion of the earth was as absurd as were Velikovsky's ideas \nwhen compared with the facts, theories and standards of the fifties.

He must either agree with the first part of \nthe judgement of the Church experts, or admit that standards, facts \nand laws never decide a case and that an unfounded, opaque and \nincoherent doctrine can be presented as a fundamental truth. Only \nfew admirers of Galileo have an inkling of this rather complex \nsituation. \nThe situation becomes even more complex when we consider that \nthe Copernicans changed not only views, but also standards for \njudging views. Aristotelians, in this respect not at all unlike modern \nepidemiologists, molecular biologists and 'empirical' sociologists \nwho insist either on the examination oflarge statistical samples or on \n'clearcut experimental steps' in Luria's sense, demanded strong \nempirical support while the Galileans were content with far­\nreaching, unsupported and partially refuted theories. 13 I do not \ncriticize them for that; on the contrary, I favour Niels Bohr's 'this is \nnot crazy enough'. I merely want to reveal the contradiction in the \nactions of those who praise Galileo and condemn the Church, but \nbecome as strict as the Church was at Galileo's time when turning to \nthe work of their contemporaries. \nOn the second point, the social (ethical) implications, the experts \ndeclared the Copernican doctrine to be 'formally heretical'.

Today a similar clash between \ntheoreticians and empiricists occurs in the field of epidemiology. There are theoretical \nreasons to expect that X-rays and other forms of particulate radiation constitute a \ncancer-risk down to the smallest dose.

The assumption was \nshared by all great scientists, Copernicus, Kepler and Newton among \nthem. According to Newton knowledge flows from two sources - the \nword of God - the Bible - and the works of God - Nature; and he \npostulated divine interventions in the planetary system, as we have \nseen.14 \nThe Roman Church in addition claimed to possess the exclusive \nrights of exploring, interpreting and applying Holy Scripture. Lay \npeople, according to the teaching of the Church, had neither the \nknowledge nor the authority to tamper with Scripture and they were \nforbidden to do so. This comment, whose rigidity was a result of the \nnew Tridentine Spirit, 15 should not surprise anyone familiar with \nthe habits of powerful institutions. The attitude of the American \nMedical Association towards lay practitioners is as rigid as the \nattitude of the Church was towards lay interpreters - and it has the \nblessing of the law. Experts, or ignoramuses having acquired the \nformal insignia of expertise, always tried and often succeeded in \nsecuring for themselves exclusive rights in special domains. Any \ncriticism of the rigidity of the Roman Church applies also to its \nmodern scientific and science-connected successors. \nTurning now from the form and the administrative backing of the \nobjection to its content we notice that it deals with a subject that is \ngaining increasing importance in our own times - the quality of \nhuman existence. Heresy, defined in a wide sense, meant a deviation \nfrom actions, attitudes and ideas that guarantee a well-rounded and \nsanctified life. Such a deviation might be, and occasionally was, \nencouraged by scientific research. Hence, it became necessary to \nexamine the heretical implications of scientific developments. \nTwo ideas are contained in this attitude. First, it is assumed that \nthe quality oflife can be defined independently of science, that it may \nclash with demands which scientists regard as natural ingredients of \ntheir activity, and that science must be changed accordingly. \nSecondly, it is assumed that Holy Scripture as interpreted by the \nHoly Roman Church adumbrates a correct account of a well­\nrounded and sanctified life. \n14.

Many scientists agree with this judgement.16 \nThey agree that the quality of life can be defined independently of \nscience - which is the first part of the first assumption. At the time of \nGalileo there existed an institution - the Roman Church - watching \nover this quality in its own particular way.

These are intellectual pains that rationalists - like \nbad physicians confronted by ailments they cannot diagnose or cure - are apt to \ndismiss as \"imagination\".' \nThe clearest and most perceptive statement is found in Jacques Monod, Chana and \nNecessity, New York, 1972, p. 170 (text in brackets from p. 169): 'Cold and austere,' \nwrites Monod, 'proposing no explanation but imposing an ascetic renunciation of all \nother spiritual fare, [the idea that objective knowledge is the only authentic source of \ntruth ] was not of a kind to allay anxiety but aggravated it instead. By a single stroke it \nclaimed to sweep away the traditions of hundreds of thousands of years, which had \nbecome one with human nature itself. It wrote an end to the ancient animist convenant \nbetween man and nature, leaving nothing in place of that precious bond but an anxious \nquest in a frozen universe of solitude. With nothing to recommend it but a certain \npuritan arrogance, how could such an idea win acceptance? It did not; it still has not. It \nhas however commanded recognition; but that it did only because of its prodigious \npower of performance.' \n",

Now if it should tum out that it is also \nrequired on ethical grounds, then we have two reasons instead of one \nrather than a conflict with 'science'. \nBesides, the Church, and by this I mean its most outstanding \nspokesmen, was much more modest than that. It did not say: what \ncontradicts the Bible as interpreted by us must go, no matter how \nstrong the scientific reasons in its favour. A truth supported by \nscientific reasoning was not pushed aside. It was used to revise the \ninterpretation of Bible passages apparently inconsistent with it. \nThere are many Bible passages which seem to suggest a flat earth. \nYet Church doctrine accepted the spherical earth as a matter of \ncourse. On the other hand the Church was not ready to change just \nbecause somebody had produced some vague guesses. It wanted \nproof - scientific proof in scientific matters. Here it acted no \ndifferently from modem scientific institutions: universities, schools \nand even research institutes in various countries usually wait a long \ntime before they incorporate new ideas into their curricula. \n(Professor Stanley Goldberg has described the situation in the case \nof the special theory of relativity.)

Hence Galileo was advised to \nteach Copernicus as a hypothesis; he was forbidden to teach it as a \ntruth. \nThis distinction has survived until today.

Besides, the formal properties of'approximations' often \ndiffer from those of the basic principles, many theories are first steps \ntowards a new point of view which at some future time may yield them \nas approximations and a direct inference from theory to reality is \ntherefore rather naive}8 All this was known to 16th- and 17th­\ncentury scientists. Only a few astronomers thought of deferents and \nepicycles as real roads in the sky; most regarded them as roads on \npaper which might aid calculation but which had no counterpart in \nreality. The Copernican point of view was widely interpreted in the \nsame way - as an interesting, novel and rather efficient model. The \nChurch requested, both for scientific and for ethical reasons, that \nGalileo accept this interpretation. Considering the difficulties the \nmodel faced when regarded as a description of reality, we must admit \nthat '[l]ogic was on the side of . . .  Bellarmine and not on the side of \nGalileo,' as the historian of science and physical chemist Pierre \nDuhem wrote in an interesting essay. 19 \nTo sum up: the judgement of the Church experts was scientifically \ncorrect and had the right social intention, viz. to protect people from \nthe machinations of specialists. It wanted to protect people from \nbeing corrupted by a narrow ideology that might work in restricted \ndomains but was incapable of sustaining a harmonious life. A revision \nof the judgement might win the Church some friends among \nscientists but would severely impair its function as a preserver of \nimportant human and superhuman values. 20 \nesp. pp. 85f, Galileo addresses precisely these points. He agrees that if the Copernican \nastronomers are 'not more than ninety percent right, they may be dismissed' but adds \nthat 'if all that is produced by philosophers and astronomers on the opposite side is \nshown to be mosdy false and wholly inconsequential, then the other side should not be \ndisparaged, nor deemed paradoxical, so as to think that it could never be clearly \nproved': research should be permitted even if demonstrations are not yet available. \nThis does not conflict with Bellarmino's suggestions; it did conflict and to a certain \nextent still does conflict with the attitude of many modem research institutions. \n18.

Physics, for \nexample, was a general theory of motion that described change \nwithout reference to the circumstances under which it occurred. It \ncomprised locomotion, the growth of plants and animals as well as \nthe transition of knowledge from a wise teacher to an ignorant pupil. \nAristotle's Physics and the many mediaeval commentaries on it give us \nan idea of the problems treated and the solutions proposed. \nCosmology described the structure of the universe and the special \nmotions that are found in it. A basic law of physics in the sense just \nexplained was that a motion without motor comes to a standstill - the \n'natural' situation of a body is rest (this includes lack of qualitative \nchange). The 'natural' motions of cosmology were those that occurred \nwithout noticeable interference; examples are the upward motion of \nfire and the downward motion of stones. Aristotle's On the HetlVens \nand the many mediaeval commentaries on it give us an idea of the \nproblems and the view discussed in this domain. \nThe books I just mentioned were for advanced studies only. \nIntroductory texts omitted problems and alternative suggestions and \nconcentrated on the bare bones of the ideas then held.

It was never a necessary boundary condition for \nastronomy which dealt with the motions of the stars, but without \nclaiming truth for its models. Astronomers were interested in models \nthat might correspond to the actual arrangement of the planets, but \nthey were not restricted to them. Handbooks of astronomy such as \nPtolemy's handbook and the various popularizations based on it \ncontained detailed astronomical models preceded by sketchy \ncosmological introductions. As far as these introductions were \nconcerned, there existed only one cosmology-Aristotle's. Some of the \nhandbooks also contained tables. Tables were a further step away from \n'reality'.

The request is connected with the assumption that \ninequalities are apparent while circular motions alone are real. Let us \ncall this the first reality assumption. But Copernicus also discovered \nthat his procedure allowed him to incorporate every planetary path \ninto a system, containing the 'large circle', the circle of the earth, as \nan absolute measure. 'All these phenomena', Copernicus writes in \nhis main work, 13 'are connected with one another in a most noble \nway, as if by a golden chain, and each planet with its position and \norder is a witness that the earth moves while we, who live on the \nterrestrial globe, failing to recognize its motion, ascribe all sorts of \nmotions to the planets.'

I call this the seamd reality assumption. \nThe first reality assumption was part of the Platonic tradition; \nAristotle gave it a physical basis. The second reality assumption \nconflicted with Aristotelian physics and cosmology. Aristotle had \nalready criticized an earlier (Pythagorean) version ofit: mathematical \nharmonies, which are abstractions, reflect truth only if they agree \nwith well-confirmed physical principles. This is a reasonable \nrequest; it was used in our own century to reject Schroedinger's \ninterpretation of wave mechanics.

It is unreasonable \nfor a Platonist or a Pythagorean. The resulting clash between two \ninterpretations of the nature of mathematical statements played an \nimportant role in the 'Copernican Revolution'. \nCopernicus strengthened the second reality assumption by \nreferring to traditions such as the Hermetic tradition and the idea of \nthe exceptional role of the sun14 and by showing how it could be \nreconciled with the phenomena.

This does not mean \nthat it is bad; it only means that it cannot be reconciled with the \nleading methodologies of today. \nMy second example is Michael Maestlin, Kepler's teacher. Maestlin \nwas an expert astronomer and his judgement was generally \nrespected. He 'only reluctantly abandoned' the Ptolemaic distribu­\ntion of the spheres - but he was forced to do so by circumstances \nbeyond his control.15 As far as we can see, the circumstances were, \nfirst, the nova of 1572. Maestlin observed it, measured its parallax \nand put it beyond the sphere of the moon into the sphere of the fixed \nstars. The first part (beyond the moon) followed for Maestlin from \nthe missing parallax, the second part (fixed stars) from the absence of \nany proper motion. According to Copernicus, whose ideas Maestlin \nused at this point, a planet moves more slowly the greater its distance \nfrom the sun. Observing the changes of colour and brighhless \nMaestlin (and Tycho who saw the new star on the way to his \nalchemical laboratory) inferred that the region above the moon \ncannot be without change, as Aristotle had assumed. However, it \nwould be rash to conclude that Maestlin (and Tycho) regarded the \nnova as a 'blow against the peripatetic philosophy' .16 Many Church \npeople, Theodore Beza among them, regarded the phenomenon as a \nreturn of the star of Bethlehem, i.e. as a supernatural event.17 Tycho \nthought this comparison too modest; here, he said, is the greatest \nmiracle since the beginning of the world, comparable at least to \nJoshua's stopping of the sun.18 This means that as far as Tycho was \nconcerned miracles refuted the idea of the autonomy of the laws of \n1 5.

Maestlin, on the other hand, being perhaps more sceptical \nabout miracles, may indeed have regarded the case as a 'blow against' \nAristotle. \nThe next question is how serious a blow it was for him. The idea of \na permanent heaven was part of cosmology and contained the special \nhypothesis of a fifth element. The falsehood of this hypothesis \nimpaired neither the remaining laws of motion nor the tower \nargument. Both Clavius and Tycho accepted a changing heaven19 \nbut still used the tower argument to exclude the motion of the earth. \nIf Maestlin's doubts reached further then this was due either to an \nidiosyncratic interpretation of the Aristotelian doctrines, or to \npersonal inclinations towards a non-Aristotelian world-view. It \nseems that we must assume the latter. \nThe next decisive event on Maestlin's journey towards Copernicus \nwas the comet of 1 577. Again Maestlin, prompted by 'numerous \nobservations', puts the comet into the superlunar region. 20 The idea \nthat this region is free from change has now definitely been dropped. \nMaestlin also tried to determine the trajectory of the comet. He \nfound it to be moving in the path of Venus as described in Book 6, \nChapter 12 of de Revolutionibus. Somewhat hesitatingly he now \naccepts the Copernican ordering of the spheres. 21 But, so he adds, \nhe was forced to do so 'by extreme necessity'. 22 \nThis 'extreme necessity' arises only when geometrical considera­\ntions are given the force of cosmological arguments. Many years later \nGalileo cautioned against this way of reasoning: rainbows, he said, \ncannot be caught by triangulation. Maestlin had no such doubts. He \naccepted the traditional distinction between physics and astronomy \nand identified astronomy with mathematics: 'Copernicus wrote his \nentire book not as a physicist, but as an astronomer' is his comment \non the margin of his copy of de Revolutionibus.23 He then interpreted \nthe results of mathematical arguments by using the second reality \nassumption. This means that he did not uvercome an Aristotelian \nresistance against such an interpretation, he acted as if such a \nresistance did not exist.

Kepler too became a Copernican because of this \nharmony and because of the comet, the interesting fact being that \nMaestlin' s calculations of the path of the comet contain serious \nmistakes; it did not move in the orbit of Venus. \nNow let us compare these events and the situations in which they \noccur with some once popular philosophies of science. We notice at \nonce that none of these philosophies considers all the disciplines that \ncontributed to the debate. Astronomy is in the centre. A rational \nreconstruction of the developments in this area is thought to be a \nrational reconstruction of the Copernican Revolution itself. The role \nof physics (the tower argument), the fact that theology occasionally \nformed a strong boundary condition (cf. Tycho's reaction to his nova \nand to the idea of the motion of the earth) and the role of different \nmathematical philosophies shows that this cannot possibly be true. \nThis fatal incompleteness is the first and most fundamental objection \nagainst all reconstructions that have been offered.

To show this, let us consider the \nfollowing accounts: \n1 .  Naive empiricism: the Middle Ages read the Bible and never \nlooked at the sky. Then people suddenly looked upwards and found \nthat the world was different from the opinion of the schools. \nThis account has disappeared from astronomy - but its analogue \nsurvives in other areas (for example, in some parts of the history of \nmedicine). The main argument against it is that Aristotle was an arch \nempiricist and that Ptolemy used carefully collected data. 25 \n2. Sophisticated empiricism: new observations forced astronomers \nto modify an already empirical doctrine. \n25. 'Carefully' has been contested by R.R.

As we have seen, Copernicus thought the Ptolemaic \nsystem to be empirically adequate - he criticized it for theoretical \nreasons. And his 'observations' are essentially those of Ptolemy, as he \nsays himself. \nModem comparisons of Copernican and Ptolemaic predictions \n'with the facts', i.e. with 19th- and 20th-century calculations, show, \nfurthermore, that empirical predictions were not improved and \nactually become worse when the competing systems are restricted to \nthe same number of parameters. 26 \nThe only new observations made were those ofTycho Brahe - but \nthey already led beyond Copernicus to Kepler. Galileo's observa­\ntions belong to cosmology, not to astronomy. They lend plausibility to \nsome of Copernicus' analogies.

Falsificationism: new observations refuted important assump­\ntions of the old astronomy and led to the invention of a new one. This \nis not correct for Copernicus and the domain of astronomy (see \nabove, comments on 2). The 'refutation' of the immutability of the \nheavens was neither compelling nor decisive for the problem of the \nmotion of the earth. Besides, the idea of the motion of the earth was \nin big trouble or, if you will, 'refuted'. It could survive only if it was \ntreated with kindness. But if it could be treated with kindness, then so \ncould the older system. \nWe see here very clearly how misguided it is to try reducing the \nprocess 'Copernican Revolution' to a single principle, such as the \nprinciple of falsification. Falsifications played a role just as new \nobservations played a role. But both were imbedded in a complex \npattern of events which contained tendencies, attitudes, and \nconsiderations of an entirely different nature. \n4.

Poper's 'critical' rationalism fails for the same reasons. \nLet us now use the material of the preceding sections to throw light \non the following features of contemporary empiricism: (1) the \ndistinctions between a context of discovery and a context of \njustification - norms and facts, observational terms and theoretical \nterms; (2) Popper's 'critical' rationalism; (3) the problem of \nincommensurability.

(A river may be subdivided by national \nboundaries but this does not make it a discontinuous entity.) Now \nthere is, of course, a very noticeable difference between the rules of \ntesting as 'reconstructed' by philosophers of science and the \nprocedures which scientists use in actual research. This difference is \napparent to the most superficial examination. On the other hand, a \nmost superficial examination also shows that a determined applica­\ntion of the methods of criticism and proof which are said to belong to \nthe context of justification would wipe out science as we know it -\nand would never have permitted it to arise.2 Conversely, the fact \nthat science exists proves that these methods were frequently over­\nruled. They were overruled by procedures which belong to the \ncontext of discovery. Thus the attempt 'to retrace the historical \norigins, the psychological genesis and development, the socio­\npolitical-economic conditions for the acceptance or rejection of \nscientific theories', far from being irrelevant for the standards of test, \nactually leads to a criticism of these standards - pruvided the two \ndomains, historical research and discussion of test procedures, are \nnot kept apart by fiat. \nIn another paper Feigl repeats his arguments and adds some \nfurther points. He is 'astonished that . . .  scholars such as N.R. \nHanson, Thomas Kuhn, Michael Polanyi, Paul Feyerabend, \nSigmund Koch et a/., consider the distinction as invalid or at least \nmisleading'. 3 And he points out that neither the psychology of \ninvention nor any similarity, however great, between the sciences and \nthe arts can show that it does not exist.

But \nthis possibility is never realized. Inventing theories and contemplating \nthem in a relaxed and 'artistic' fashion, scientists often make moves \nthat are forbidden by methodological rules.

This is part one of the \nargument. Now we have seen that science as we know it today could \nnot exist without a frequent overruling of the context of justification. \nThis is part two of the argument. The conclusion is clear. Part one \nshows that we do not have a difference, but a mixture. Part two shows \nthat replacing the mixture by an order that contains discovery on one \nside and justification on the other would have ruined science: we are \ndealing with a uniform practice all of whose ingredients are equaly \nimportant for the growth of science. This disposes of the distinction. \nA similar argument applies to the ritual distinction between \nmethodological prescriptions and historical descriptions. Methodology, \nit is said, deals with what should be done and cannot be criticized by \nreference to what is. But we must of course make sure that our \nprescriptions have a point of anack in the historical material, and we \nmust also make sure that their determined application leads to \ndesirable results. We make sure by considering (historical, socio­\nlogical, physical, psychological, etc.) tendencies and laws which tell us \nwhat is possible and what is not possible under the given circum­\nstances and thus separate feasible prescriptions from those which are \ngoing to lead into dead ends. Again, progress can be made only if the \ndistinction between the ought and the is is regarded as a temporary \ndevice rather than as a fundamental boundary line. \nA distinction which once may have had a point but which has now \ndefinitely lost it is the distinction between observational terms and \ntheoretical terms. It is now generally admitted that this distinction is \nnot as sharp as it was thought to be only a few decades ago. It is also \nadmitted, in complete agreement with Neurath's original views, that \nboth theories and observations can be abandoned: theories may be \nremoved because of conflicting observations, observations may be \nremoved for theoretical reasons. Finally, we have discovered that \nlearning does not go from observation to theory but always involves \nboth elements. Experience arises together with theoretical assump­\ntions not before them, and an experience without theory is just as \nincomprehensible as is (allegedly) a theory without experience: \neliminate part of the theoretical knowledge of a sensing subject and \nyou have a person who is completely disoriented and incapable of \nCarying out the simplest action.

Now critical rationalism \nis either a meaningful idea or it is a collection of slogans that can be \nadapted to any situation. \nIn the first case it must be possible to produce rules, standards, \nrestrictions which permit us to separate critical behaviour (thinking, \nsinging, writing of plays) from other types of behaviour so that we can \ndiscuver irrational actions and correa them with the help of concrete \nsuggestions. It is not difficult to produce the standards of rationality \ndefended by the Popperian school. \nThese standards are standards of criticism: rational discussion \nconsists in the attempt to criticize, and not in the attempt to prove or \nto make probable. Every step that protects a view from criticism, that \nmakes it safe or 'well-founded', is a step away from rationality. \nEvery step that makes it more vulnerable is welcome. In addition, \nit is recommended to abandon ideas which have been found want­\ning and it is forbidden to retain them in the face of strong and \nsuccessful criticism unless one can present suitable counter­\narguments. Develop your ideas so that they can be criticized; \nattack them relentlessly; do not try to protect them, but exhibit \ntheir weak spots; eliminate them as soon as such weak spots have \nbecome manifest - these are some of the rules put forth by our \ncritical rationalists. \nThese rules become more definite and more detailed when we \ntum to the philosophy of science and, especially, to the philosophy of \nthe natural sciences. \nWithin the natural sciences, criticism is connected with experi­\nment and observations. The content of a theory consists in the sum \ntotal of those basic statements which contradict it; it is the class of its \npotential falsifiers.

Increase of content is welcome, decrease of content is to be \navoided. A theory that contradicts an accepted basic statement must \nbe given up. Ad hoc hypotheses are forbidden - and so on.

It is due to the fact that certain expeaations have been \ndisappointed: on the one hand it seems to be clear that the stars must \nbe divine, hence one expects them to behave in an orderly and lawful \nmanner. On the other hand, one cannot find any easily discernible \nregularity. The planets, to al intents and purposes, move in a quite \nchaotic fashion. How can this fact be reconciled with the expectation \nand with the principles that underlie the expectation? Does it show \nthat the expectation is mistaken? Or have we failed in our analysis of \nthe facts? This is the problem. \nIt is important to see that the elements of the problem are not \nsimply given. The 'fact' of irregularity, for example, is not accessible \nwithout further ado. It cannot be discovered by just anyone who has \nhealthy eyes and a good mind. It is only through a certain expectation \nthat it becomes an object of our attention. Or, to be more accurate, \nthis fact of irregularity exists because there is an expectation of \nregularity and because there are ideas which define what it means to \nbe 'regular'. After al, the term 'irregularity' makes sense only if we \nhave a rule. In our case the rule that defines regularity asserts circular \nmotion with constant angular velocity. The fixed stars agree with this \nrule and so does the sun, if we trace its path relative to the fixed stars. \nThe planets do not obey the rule, neither directly, with respect to the \nearth, nor indirectly, with respect to the fixed stars. \n(In the problem we are examining now the rule is formulated \nexplicitly and it can be discussed. This is not always the case. \nRecognizing a colour as red is made possible by deep-lying \npatterns concerning the structure of our surroundings and recog­\nnition does not occur when these patterns cease to exist.) \nTo sum up this part of the Popperian doctrine: research starts with \na problem. The problem is the result of a conflict between an \nexpectation and an observation which is constituted by the \nexpectation. It is clear that this doctrine differs from the doctrine of \ninductivism where objective facts enter a passive mind and leave their \ntraces there. It was prepared by Kant, Mach, Poincare, Dingler, and \nby Mil (On Liberty). \nHaving formulated a problem, one tries to solve it. Solving a \nproblem means inventing a theory that is relevant, falsifiable (to a \ndegree larger than any alternative), but not yet falsified. In the case \nmentioned above (planets at the time ofPlato), the problem is: to find \ncircular motions of constant angular velocity for the purpose of saving \nthe planetary phenomena.

Critical \nrationalism arose from the attempt to understand the Einsteinian \nrevolution, and it was then extended to politics and even to the \nconduct of one's private life. Such a procedure may satisfy a school \nphilosopher, who looks at life through the spectacles of his own \ntechnical problems and recognizes hatred, love, happiness, only to \nthe extent to which they occur in these problems. But if we consider \nhuman interests and, above all, the question of human freedom \n(freedom from hunger, despair, from the tyranny of constipated \nsystems of thought and not the academic 'freedom of the will'), then \nwe are proceeding in the worst possible fashion. \nFor is it not possible that science as we know it today, or a \n'search for the truth' in the style of traditional philosophy, wil \ncreate a monster? Is it not possible that an objective approach that \nfrowns upon personal connections between the entities examined \nwill harm people, turn them into miserable, unfriendly, self­\nrighteous mechanisms without charm and humour? 'Is it not \npossible,' asks Kierkegaard, 'that my activity as an objective [or a \ncritico-rationalJ observer of nature wil weaken my strength as a \nhuman being?' I suspect the answer to many of these questions is \naffirmative and I believe that a reform of the sciences that makes \nthem more anarchic and more subjective (in Kierkegaard's sense) is \nurgently needed. \nBut these are not the problems I want to discuss now. In the \npresent essay I shall restrict myself to the second question and I shal \nask: is it possible to have both a science as we know it and the rules of \na critical rationalism as just described? And to this question the \nanswer seems to be a firm and resounding NO. \nTo start with we have seen, though rather briefly, that the actual \ndevelopment of institutions, ideas, practices, and so on, often does not \nstart from a problem but rather from some extraneous activity, such as \nplaying, which, as a side effect, leads to developments which later on \ncan be interpreted as solutions to unrealized problems.6 Are such \ndevelopments to be excluded?

Theories \nwhich effect the overthrow of a comprehensive and well-entrenched \npoint of view, and take over after its demise, are initially restricted to a \nfairly narrow domain of facts, to a series of paradigmatic phenomena \nwhich lend them support, and they are only slowly extended to other \nareas. This can be seen from historical examples (footnote 12 of \nChapter 8), and it is also plausible on general grounds: trying to \ndevelop a new theory, we must first take a step back from the evidence \nand reconsider the problem of observation (this was discussed in \nChapter 1 1). Later on, of course, the theory is extended to other \ndomains; but the mode of extension is only rarely determined by the \nelements that constitute the content of its predecessors. The slowly \nemerging conceptual apparatus of the theory soon starts defining its \nown problems, and earlier problems, facts, and observations are either \nforgotten or pushed aside as irrelevant. This is an entirely natural \ndevelopment, and quite unobjectionable. For why should an ideology \nbe constrained by older problems which, at any rate, make sense only \nin the abandoned context and which look silly and unnatural now? \nWhy should it even consider the 'facts' that gave rise to problems of \nthis kind or played a role in their solutions? Why should it not rather \nproceed in its own way, devising its own tasks and assembling its own \ndomain of 'facts'? A comprehensive theory, after all, is supposed to \ncontain also an ontology that determines what exists and thus delimits \nthe domain of possible facts and possible questions. The develop­\nment of science agrees with these considerations. New views soon \nstrike out in new directions and frown upon the older problems (what \nis the base upon which the earth rests? what is the specific weight of \nphlogiston? what is the absolute velocity of the earth?) and the older \nfaas (most of the facts described in the Malleus Maleficarum- Chapter \n8, footnote 2 - the facts of Voodoo - Chapter 4, footnote 8 - the \nproperties of phlogiston or those of the ether) which so much \nexercised the minds of earlier thinkers.

They specify possible \nexplananda and explanatia, and thus determine the direction of \nfuture research. They may have to be retained forever if the new \nframework is partly unfinished (this happened in the case of the \nquantum theory, which needs the classical concepts to tum it into a \ncomplete theory). Or they are incorporated into the new theory as \ntheorems, leading to a redefinition of the basic terms of the \nproceeding ideology (this happened in the cases of Galileo and of the \ntheory of relativity). The demand that the truth-content of the earlier \ntheory as conceived while the earlier theory reigned supreme be included \nin the truth-content of the successor is violated in either case. \nTo sum up: wherever we look, whatever examples we consider, we \nsee that the principles of critical rationalism (take falsifications \nseriously; increase content; avoid ad hoc hypotheses; 'be honest' -\nwhatever that means; and so on) and, a fortiori, the principles of \nlogical empiricism (be precise; base your theories on measurements; \navoid vague and untestable ideas; and so on), though practised \nin special areas, give an inadequate account of the past development \nof science as a whole and are liable to hinder it in the future. They give \nan inadequate account of science because science is much more \nI 0. This illusion is the core of Elie Zahar's excellent paper on the development \nfrom Lorentz to Einstein. According to Zahar, Einstein superseded Lorentz with the \nexplanation of the perihelion of Mercury (1915). But in 1915 nobody had as yet \nsucceeded in giving a relativistic account of clasical perturbation theory to the degree \nof approximation reached by Laplace and Poincarƚ, and the implications of Lorentz on \nthe atomic level (electron theory of metals) were not accounted for either, but were \ngradualy replaced by the quantum theory: Lorentz was 'superseded' not by one, hut by \naƛ least two different and mutually incommensurable programes. Lakatos, in \nhis excellent reconstruction of the development of the research programe of \nCopernicus from the Commentariolus to the De RtvOI., notes progressive changes but \n09 because he omits the dynamical and the optical problems and concentrates on \nƜematics, pure and simple. Smal wonder that both Zahar and Lakatos are under the \nlllpression that the content condition is stil satisfied.

The illusion of rationality \nbecomes especially strong when a scientific institution opposes \npolitical demands. In this case one class of standards is set against \nanother such class - and this is quite legitimate: each organization, \neach party, each religious group has a right to defend its particular \nform of life and all the standards it contains.

This is a disastrous \nsituation, and one not easily mended. But I do not see how a \nrationalistic methodology can help. As far as I am concerned the first \nand the most pressing problem is to get education out of the hands of \nthe 'professional educators'. The constraints of grades, competition, \nregular examination must be removed and we must also separate the \nprocess of learning from the preparation for a particular trade. I grant that \nbusiness, religions, special professions such as science or prostitu­\ntion, have a right to demand that their participants and/ or \npractitioners conform to standards they regard as important, and that \nthey should be able to ascertain their competence. I also admit that \nthis implies the need for special types of education that prepare a man \nor a woman for the corresponding 'examinations'. The standards \ntaught need not be 'rational' or 'reasonable' in any sense, though they \nwill be usually presented as such; it suffices that they are accepted by \nthe groups one wants to join, be it now Science, or Big Business, or \nThe One True Religion. After all, in a democracy 'reason' has just as \nmuch right to be heard and to be expressed as 'unreason' especially in \nview of the fact that one man's 'reason' is the other man's insanity. \nBut one thing must be avoided at all costs: the special standards \nwhich define special subjects and special professions must not be \nallowed to permeate general education and they must not be made the \ndefining property of a 'well-educated person'. General education \nshould prepare citizens to choose between the standards, or to find their \nway in a society that contains groups committed to various standards, \nbut it must under no condition bend their minds so that they conform to the \nstandards of one particular group. The standards wil be considered, they \nwill be discussed, children will be encouraged to get proficiency in the \nmore important subjects, but only as one gets proficiency in a game, that \nis, without serious commitment and without robbing the mind of its \nability to play other games as well.

There is not even a tendency to \nsearch - and this is quite appropriate, 'conceptually' speaking. For it \nwould indeed be nonsensical to 'look for' an after-image. Its \n'concept' does not provide for such an operation. \nThe arrival of the concept, and of the perceptual image, of material \nobjects, changes the situation quite dramatically. There occurs a \ndrastic reorientation of behavioural patterns and, so one may \nconjecture, of thought. After-images, or things somewhat like them, \nstill exist; but they are now difficult to find and must be discovered \nby special methods (the earlier visual world therefore literally dis­\nappears).13 Such methods proceed from a new conceptual scheme \n(after-images occur in humans, they are not parts of the physical \nworld) and cannot lead back to the exact phenomena of the previous \nstage. (These phenomena should therefore be called by a different \nname, such as 'pseudo-after-images' - a very interesting perceptual \nanalogue to the transition from, say, Newtonian mechanics to special \nrelativity: relativity, too, does not give us Newtonian facts, but \nrelativistic analogues of Newtonian facts.) Neither after-images nor \npseudo-after-images have a special position in the new world. For \nexample, they are not treated as evidence on which the new notion of a \nmaterial object is supposed to rest. Nor can they be used to explain \nthis notion: after-images arise together with it, they depend on it, and \nare absent from the minds of those who do not yet recognize material \nobjects; and pseudo-after-images disappear as soon as such \nrecognition takes place. The perceptual field never contains after­\nimages together with pseudo-after-images. It is to be admitted that \nevery stage possesses a kind of observational 'basis' to which special \nattention is paid and from which a multitude of suggestions are \nreceived. However, this basis (a) changes from stage to stage, and (b) it \nis part of the conceptual apparatus of a given stage, not its one and \nonly source of interpretation as some empiricists would like to make \nus believe. \nConsidering developments such as these, we may suspect that the \nfamily of concepts centring upon 'material object' and the family of \nconcepts centring upon 'pseudo-after-image' are incommensurable \n13.

We shall see that such an analysis \nof outlines provides a better understanding of the process of \nconceptual change than either a naturalistic account which \nrecognizes only one 'reality' and orders artworks by their closeness to \nit, or trite slogans such as 'a critical discussion and a comparison of \n. . .  various frameworks is always possible'. 28 Of course, some kind of \ncomparison is always possible (for example, one physical theory may \nsound more melodious when read aloud to the accompaniment of a \nguitar than another physical theory).

This 'additive' \nfeature of the archaic style becomes very clear from the treatment of \nthe eye. The eye does not participate in the actions of the body, it \ndoes not guide the body or establish contact with the surrounding \nsituation, it does not 'look'. It is added on to the profile head like part \n27.

Archaic pictures \nare paratactic aggregates, not hypotactic systems. The elements of the \naggregate may be physical parts such as heads, arms, wheels, they \nmay be states of affair such as the fact that a body is dead, they may be \nactions, such as the action of swallowing. \nInstead of describing the formal features of a style, we may \ndescribe the ontological features of a world that consists of the elements \nrepresented in the style, arranged in the appropriate way, and we may \nalso describe the impression such a world makes upon the viewer. \nThis is the procedure of the art critic who loves to dwell on the \npeculiar behaviour of the characters which the artist puts on his \ncanvas and on the 'internal life' the behaviour seems to indicate. \nThus G.M.S. Hanfmann37 writes on the archaic figure: 'No matter \nhow animated and agile archaic heroes may be, they do not appear to \nmove by their own will. Their gestures are explanatory formulae \nimposed upon the actors from without in order to explain what sort of \naction is going on.

It shows that a person is alive, but it cannot adjust itself to \nthe demands of a specific situation. Even when the archaic artist \nsucceeds in denoting a humorous or tragic mood, these factors of \nexternalized gesture and detached glance recall the exaggerated \nanimation of a puppet play.' \nAn ontological description frequently adds just verbiage to the \n36.

(In the case of the 'archaic' style we must not disregard \nthe possibility that humans then actually felt themselves to be what \nwe today would call puppets guided by outside forces and that they \nsaw and treated others accordingly.) Such a realistic interpretation of \nstyles would be in line with Whorfs thesis that in addition to being \ninstruments for describing events (which may have other features, not \ncovered by any description) languages are also shapers of events (so \nthat there is a linguistic limit to what can be said in a given language, \nand this limit coincides with the limits of the thing itself) but it would \ngo beyond it by including non-linguistic means of representation.38 \nThe realistic interpretation is very plausible. But it must not be taken \nfor granted. 39 \nIt must not be taken for granted, for there are technical failures, \nspecial purposes (caricature) which may change a style without \nchanging the cosmology. We must also remember that humans have \nroughly the same neurophysiological equipment, so that perception \ncannot be bent in any direction one chooses. 40 And in some cases we \ncan indeed show that deviations from a 'faithful rendering of nature' \noccur in the presence of a detailed knowledge of the object and side \nby side with more 'realistic' presentations: the workshop of the \nsculptor Thutmosis in Tel al-Amama (the ancient Achet-Aton) \ncontains masks directly taken from live models with all the details of \nthe formation of the head (indentations) and of the face intact, as well \nas heads developed from such masks. Some of these heads preserve \nthe details, others eliminate them and replace them by simple forms. \nAn extreme example is the completely smooth head of an Egyptian \nman. It proves that 'at least some artists remained consciously \nindependent of nature'.41 During the reign of Amenophis IV (BC \n1364-134 7) the mode of representation was changed twice; the first \nchange, towards a more realistic style, occurred merely four years \n38.

Its main features are \n63. Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, Der Glaube der Hellenen, I ,  1955, p. 17. Our \nconceptions of the world subdivide an otherwise uniform material and create \ndifferences in perceived brightness where objective brightness has no gradient. The \nsame process is responsible for the ordering of the rather chaotic impressions of our \ninner life, leading to an (inner) perception of divine interference, and it may even \nintroduce daemons, gods, sprites into the domain of outer perceptions. At any rate -\nthere is a sufficient number of daemonic experiences not to reject this conjecture out \nof hand. \n64. This means that success is not the result of an effort on the part of the \nindividual but the fortunate fitting together of circumstances. This shows itself even in \nwords like 3tQci.TtfW, which seem to designate activities. In Homer such words \nemphasize not so much the effect of the agent as the fact that the result comes about in \nthe right way, that the process that brings it about does not encounter too many \ndisturbances; it fits into the other processes that surround it (in the Attic dialect \nEU3tci.Ttw still means 'I am doing well'). \nSimilarly 'ttuXE&.V emphasizes \nnot so much a personal achievement as the fact that things go well, that they fit into \ntheir surroundings. The same is true of the acquisition of knowledge. 'Odysseus has \nseen a lot and experienced much, moreover, he is the 3tOAUJ.'TJX<lVoc; who can \nalways help himself in new ways, and, finally, he is the man who listens to his goddess \nAthena. The part of knowledge that is based on seeing is not really the result of his own \nactivity and research, it rather happened to him while he was driven around by external \ncircumstances. He is very different from Solon who, as Herodotus tells us, was the first \nto travel for theoretical reasons, because he was interested in research. In Odysseus \n7e knowledge of many things is strangely separated from his activity in the field of the \n8£oao6m: this activity is restricted to finding means for reaching a certain \natm, in order to save his life and the life of his associates.'

There is a tolerance in religious matters which later \ngenerations found morally and theoretically unacceptable and which \neven today is regarded as a manifestation of frivolous and simple \nminds. 65 Archaic man is a religious eclectic, he does not object to \nforeign gods and myths, he adds them to the existing furniture of the \nworld without any attempt at synthesis, or a removal of contradic­\ntions. There are no priests, there is no dogma, there are no \ncategorical statements about the gods, humans, the world.66 (This \ntolerance can still be found with the Ionian philosophers of nature \nwho develop their ideas side by side with myth without trying to \neliminate the latter.) There is no religious 'morality' in our sense, nor \nare the gods abstract embodiments of eternal principles. 67 This they \nbecame later, during the archaic age and as a result they 'lost [their] \nhumanity. Hence Olympianism in its moralized form tended to \nbecome a religion of fear, a tendency which is reflected in the \nreligious vocabulary. There is no word for \"god-fearing\" in the \nIliad.'68 This is how life was dehumanized by what some people are \npleased to call 'moral progress' or 'scientific progress'. \nSimilar remarks apply to the 'theory of knowledge' that is implicit \nin this early world view. The Muses in Iliad, 2.284ff, have knowledge \nbecause they are close to things -they do not have to rely on rumours­\nand because they know all the many things that are of interest to the \nwriter, one after the other.

It is the result of a complex survey carried out \nfrom suitable vantage points.

Some Greek \nartists try to find situations where perspective does not need to be considered. Thus \nthe peculiarity of the so-called red-figure style that arises in about 530 BC 'does not so \nmuch consist in the fact that foreshortenings are drawn, but in the new and highly \nvaried ways to circumvent them', E. Pfuhl, Malerei und Zeichnung der Griechen, Vol. I, \nMunich, 1923, p. 378. \n73. Cf. the discussion in Chapter I of A.J. Ayer's Foundations of Empirical \nKnowledge.

The procedure used for establishing the peculiarities of the \narchaic cosmology has much in common with the method of an \nanthropologist who examines the world-view of an association of \ntribes. The differences are due to the scarcity of the evidence and to \nthe particular circumstances of its origin (written sources; works of \nart; no personal contact). Let us take a closer look at this procedure! \nAn anthropologist trying to discover the cosmology of his chosen \ntribe and the way in which it is mirrored in language, in the arts, in \ndaily life, first learns the language and the basic social habits; he \ninquires how they are related to other activities, including such p_rima \nfacie unimportant activities as milking cows and cooking meals;81 he \ntries to identify key ideas.82 His attention to minutiae is not the \nresult of a misguided urge for completeness but of the realization that \nwhat looks insignificant to one way of thinking (and perceiving) may \nplay a most important role in another. (The differences between the \npaper-and-pencil operations of a Lorentzian and those of an \nEinsteinian are often minute, if discernible at all; yet they reflect a \nmajor clash of ideologies.) \nHaving found the key ideas the anthropologist tries to understand \nthem. This he does in the same way in which he originally gained an \nunderstanding of his own language, including the language of the \nspecial profession that provides him with an income. He internalizes \nthe ideas so that their connections are firmly engraved in his memory \nand his reactions, and can be produced at will. 'The native society has \nto be in the anthropologist himself and not merely in his notebooks if \nhe is to understand it.'83 This process must be kept free from external \ninterference. For example, the researcher must not try to get a better \nhold on the ideas of the tribe by likening them to ideas he already \nknows, or finds more comprehensible or more precise. On no \naccount must he attempt a 'logical reconstruction'. Such a procedure \nwould tie him to the known, or to what is preferred by certain groups, \nand would forever prevent him from grasping the unknown world­\nview he is examining. \nHaving completed his study, the anthropologist carries within \nhimself both the native society and his own background, and he may \nnow start comparing the two. The comparison decides whether the \nnative way of thinking can be reproduced in European tenns \n(provided there is a unique set of' European terms'), or whether it has \na 'logic' of its own, not found in any Western language.

The examination of key ideas passes through various stages, \nnone of which leads to a complete clarification. Here the researcher \nmust exercise firm control over his urge for instant clarity and logical \nperfection.

The \nNuer, a Nilotic tribe which has been examined by Evans-Pritchard, \nhave some interesting spatio-temporal concepts. 84 The researcher \nwho is not too familiar with Nuer thought wil find the concepts \n'unclear and insufficiently precise'. To improve matters he might try \nexplicating them, using modem logical notions. That might create \nclear concepts, but they would no longer be Nuer concepts. If, on the \nother hand, he wants to get concepts which are both clear and Nuer, \nthen he must keep his key notions vague and incomplete until the right \ninformation comes along, i.e. until field study turns up the missing \nelements which, taken by themselves, are just as unclear as the \nelements he has already found. \nEach item of information is a building block of understanding, \nwhich means that it has to be clarified by the discovery of further \nblocks from the language and ideology of the tribe rather than by \npremature definitions.

Exactly the same remarks apply to any attempt to explore \nimportant modem notions such as the notion ofincommensurability. \nWithin the sciences incommensurability is closely connected with \nmeaning. A study of incommensurability in the sciences will \ntherefore produce statements that contain meaning-terms - but \nthese terms will be only incompletely understood, just as the term \n'time' is incompletely understood in the quotation of the preceding \nparagraph.

And it may \nmean a particular logical system, or set of systems. \nA study of the first kind belongs to anthropology. For in order to \nsee, for example, whether AB v AB = A is part of the 'logic of \nquantum theory' we shall have to study quantum theory. And as \nquantum theory is not a divine emanation but a human product, we \nshall have to study it in the form in which human products usually are \navailable, that is, we shall have to study historical records - textbooks, \noriginal papers, records of meetings and private conversations, \nletters, and the like.

There is no doubt that the records are necessary for \na logical study in the sense examined now. The question is how they \nshould be used. \nWe want to discover the structure of the field of discourse, of \nwhich the records give an incomplete account. We want to learn \nabout it without changing it in any way. In our example we are not \ninterested in whether a peifeaed quantum mechanics of the future \nemploys AB v AB = A or whether an irrvention of our own, whether a \nlittle bit of 'reconstruction' which changes the theory so that it \nconforms to some preconceived principles of modem logic and \nreadily provides the answer employs that principle. We want to know \nwhether quantum theory as aaually praaised by physicists employs the \nprinciple. For it is the work of the physicists and not the work of the \nreconstructionists we want to examine. And this work may well be full \nof contradictions and lacunae. Its 'logic' (in the sense in which I am \nnow using the term) may well be 'illogical' when judged from the \npoint of view of a particular system of formal logic. \nPutting the question in this way we realize that it may not admit of \nany answer.

The difference \nbetween Bohr, Dirac, Feynman and von Neumann suggests that this \nis more than a distant possibility.

Such \nan examination of concrete cases may then lead to the result that \nquantum theoreticians differ from each other as widely as do \nCatholics and the various types of Protestants: they may use the same \ntexts (though even that is doubtful - just compare Dirac with von \nNeumann), but they sure are doing different things with them. \nThe need for anthropological case studies in a field that initially \nseemed to be dominated by a single myth, always the same, always \nused in the same manner, indicates that our common knowledge of \nscience may be severely defective. It may be entirely mistaken (some \nmistakes have been hinted at in the preceding chapters). In these \ncircumstances, the only safe way is to confess ignorance, to abandon \nreconstructions, and to start studying science from scratch.

Only few philosophers are prepared to concede that \nthe basic structures that underlie some newly discovered idiom might \ndiffer radically from the basic structures of the more familiar systems \nof formal logic and absolutely nobody is ready to admit that this might \nbe true of science as well. Most of the time the 'logic' (in the sense \ndiscussed so far) of a particular language, or of a theory, is \nimmediately identified with the features of a particular logical system \nwithout considering the need for an inquiry concerning the adequacy \nof such an identification. Professor Giedymin, for example, 88 means \nby 'logic' a favourite system of his which is fairly comprehensive, but \nby no means all-embracing.

It does not make the slightest difference to the logician in this \nsecond sense that his formulae do not look like scientific statements, \nthat they are not used like scientific statements and that science could \nnot possibly grow in the simple ways his brain is capable of \nunderstanding (and therefore regards as the only permissible ways). \nHe either does not notice the discrepancy or he regards it as being \ndue to imperfections that cannot enter a satisfactory account. Not \nonce does it occur to him that the 'imperfections' might have a \npositive funaion, and that scientific progress might be impossible \nonce they are removed. For him science is axiomatics plus model \ntheory plus correspondence rules plus observation language. \nSuch a procedure assumes (without noticing that there is an \nassumption involved) that an anthropological study which familiar­\nizes us with the overt and the hidden classifications of science has \nbeen completed, and that it has decided in favour of the axiomatic \n(etc., etc.) approach. No such study has ever been carried out. And \nthe bits and pieces of field work available today, mainly as the result of \n88.

The discussions of meaning I have alluded to are another \nillustration of the deficiencies of the logician's approach. For \nGiedymin, this term and its derivatives, such as the term 'incommen­\nsurability', are 'unclear and insufficiently precise'. I agree. Giedymin \nwants to make the terms clearer, he wants to understand them better. \nAgain agreement. He tries to obtain the clarity he feels is lacking by \nexplication in terms of a particular kind of formal logic and of the \ndouble language model, restricting the discussion to 'intension' and \n'extension' as explained in the chosen logic. It is here that the \ndisagreement starts. For the question is not how 'meaning' and \n'incommensurability' occur within a particular logical system. The \nquestion is what role they play in (actual, i.e. non-reconstructed) \nscience. Clarification must come from a more detailed study of this \nrole, and lacunae must be filled with the results of such study. And as \nthe filling takes time the key terms will be 'unclear and insufficiently \nprecise' for years and perhaps decades. (See also items 3 and 4 \nabove.) \n8. Logicians and philosophers of science do not see the situation \nin this way. Being both unwilling and unable to carry out an informal \ndiscussion, they demand that the main terms of the discussion be \n'clarified'. And to 'clarify' the terms of a discussion does not mean to \nstudy the aditional and as yet unknown properties of the domain in \nquestion which one needs to make them fully understood, it means to \nfill them with existing notions from the entirely different domain of \nlogic and common sense, preferably observational ideas, until they \nsound common themselves, and to take care that the process of filling \nobeys the accepted laws of logic. The discussion is permitted to \nproceed only after its initial steps have been modified in this manner. \nSo the course of an investigation is deflected into the narrow \nchannels of things already understood and the possibility of fun­\ndamental conceptual discovery (or of fundamental conceptual \nchange) is considerably reduced. Fundamental conceptual change, \non the other hand, presupposes new world-views and new languages \ncapable of expressing them. Now, building a new world-view, and a \ncorresponding new language, is a process that takes time, in science \nas well as in meta-science. The terms of the new language become \nclear only when the process is fairly advanced, so that each single \nword is the centre of numerous lines connecting it with other words, \n",

Just as a child who starts using words without yet \nunderstanding them, who adds more and more uncomprehended \nlinguistic fragments to his playful activity, discovers the sense-giving \nprinciple only after he has been active in this way for a long time - the \nactivity being a necessary presupposition of the final blossoming forth \nof sense - in the very same way the inventor of a new world-view (and \nthe philosopher of science who tries to understand his procedure) \nmust be able to talk nonsense until the amount of nonsense created \nby him and his friends is big enough to give sense to all its parts. \nThere is again no better account of this process than the description \nwhich john Stuart Mil has left us of the vicissitudes ofhis education. \nReferring to the explanations which his father gave him on logical \nmatters, he wrote: 'The explanations did not make the matter at al \nclear to me at the time; but they were not therefore useless; they \nremained as a nucleus for my observations and reflections to \ncrystallise upon; the import of his general remarks being interpreted \nto me, by the particular instances which came under my notice \nafterwards.'89 Building a new language (for understanding the world, \nor knowledge) is a process of exactly the same kind except that the \ninitial 'nuclei' are not given, but must be invented. We see here how \nessential it is to learn talking in riddles, and how disastrous an effect \nthe drive for instant clarity must have on our understanding. (In \naddition, such a drive betrays a rather narrow and barbaric mentality: \n'To use words and phrases in an easy going way without scrutinizing \nthem too curiously is not, in general, a mark of il breeding; on the \ncontrary, there is something low bred in being too precise . . . .

This is the reason for the examples in the present section. \n9. There is still another dogma to be considered before returning \nto the main narration. It is the dogma that all subjects, however \nassembled, quite automatically obey the laws of logic, or ought to \nobey the laws of logic. If this is so, then anthropological field work \nwould seem to be superfluous. 'What is true in logic is true in \npsychology . . . in scientific method, and in the history of science,' \nwrites Popper.91 \nThis dogmatic assertion is neither clear nor is it (in one of its main \ninterpretations) true. To start with, assume that the expressions \n'psychology', 'history of science', 'anthropology' refer to certain \ndomains of facts and regularities (of nature, of perception, of the \nhuman mind, of society). Then the assertion is not clear as there is not \na single subject - LOGIC - that underlies all these domains. There \nis Hegel, there is Brouwer, there are the many logical systems \nconsidered by modern constructivists. They offer not just different \ninterpretations of one and the same bulk of logical 'facts', but \ndifferent 'facts' altogether. And the assertion is not true as there exist \nlegitimate scientific statements which violate simple logical rules. For \nexample, there are statements which play an important role in \nestablished scientific disciplines and which are observationally \nadequate only if they are self-contradictory: fixate a moving pattern \nthat has just come to a standstill, and you will see it move in the \nopposite direction, but without changing its position.

For if we introduce the 'appear', we must put it at the beginning of the \nsentence, which will read 'it appears that it moves and does not change place'.

But \nalthough humans cannot have complete knowledge, they can have a \nsizeable amount of it. The wider their experience, the greater the \nnumber of adventures, of things seen, heard, read, the greater their \nknowledge. 98 \nThe new cosmology (cosmology B) that arises in the 7th to 5th \ncenturies BC distin¤hes between much-knowing, JtOAUJ,ta6(f1, \nand true knowledge,99 and it warns against trustino§ 'custom \nborn of manifold experience', £eo- JtOAUJtELQOV . 1  \nSuch a \ndistinction and such a warning make sense only in a world whose \nstructure differs from the structure of A. In one version which played a \nlarge role in the development of Western civilization and which \nunderlies such problems as the problem of the existence of theoretical \nentities and the problem of alienation the new events form what one \nmight call a True World, while the events of everyday life are now \nappearances that are but its dim and misleading reflection. 101 The \nTrue World is simple and coherent, and it can be described in a \nuniform way.

This may apply to the Presocratics, it does not apply to \nHomer.

The \n'chaos' is a direct consequence of the simplification of language that \naccompanies the belief in a True World. 102 Moreover, all the \nmanifold abilities of the observers are now directed towards this True \nWorld, they are adapted to a uniform aim, shaped for one particular \npurpose, they become more similar to each other which means that \nhumans become impoverished together with their language.

To explain, let me again take the case of the oar. \nIn the archaic view 'the oar' is a complex consisting of parts some of \nwhich are objects, some situations, some events. It is possible to say \n'the straight oar is broken' (not 'appears to be broken') just as it is \npossible to say 'swift-footed Achilles is walking slowly', for the \nelements are not set against each other. They are part of a paratactic \naggregate.

And just as a detailed periegesis exhausts \nwhat can be said about a country, in the same way a detailed list \nexhausts what can be said about an object.105 'Broken in water' \nbelongs to the oar as does 'straight to the hand'; it is 'equally real'. In \ncosmology B, however, 'broken in water' is a 'semblance' that \ncontradias what is suggested by the 'semblance' of straightness and \nthus shows the basic untrustworthiness of all semblances. 106 The \nconcept of an object has changed from the concept of an aggregate of \nequi-important perceptible parts to the concept of an imperceptible \nI 05. The idea that knowledge consists in lists reaches back far into the Sumerian \npast. Cf. von Soden, Leistung und Grmzen Sumerisch-Babylonischer Wisenschaft, new \nedn, Darmstadt, 1965. The difference between Babylonian and Greek mathematics \nand astronomy lies precisely in this. The one develops methods for the presentation of \nwhat we today call 'phenomena' and which were interesting and relevant events in the \nsky, while the other tries to develop astronomy, 'while leaving the heavens alone' \n(Plato, Rep., 530bf; Lgg., 81 8a). \n106.

(We may \nguess that the appearance of an object has changed in a similar way, \nthat objects now look less 'flat' than before.) \nConsidering these changes and peculiarities, it is plausible to \nassume that the comparison of A and B as  interpreted by the participants \n(rather than as 'reconstructed' by logically well-trained but otherwise \nilliterate outsiders) will raise various problems. In the remainder of \nthis chapter only some aspects of some of these problems will be \ndiscussed. Thus I shall barely mention the psychological changes that \naccompany the transition from A to B and which are not justa matter of \nconjecture, but can be established by independent research. Here is \nrich material for the detailed study of the role of frameworks (mental \nsets, languages, modes of representation) and the limits of rationalism. \nTo start with, cosmos A and cosmos B are built from different \nelements. \nThe elements of A are relatively independent parts of objects which \nenter into external relations. They participate in aggregates without \nchanging their intrinsic properties. The 'nature' of a particular \naggregate is determined by its parts and by the way in which the parts \nare related to each other. Enumerate the parts in the proper order, and you \nhave the objea. This applies to physical aggregates, to humans (minds \nand bodies), to animals, but it also applies to social aggregates such as \nthe honour of a warrior. \nThe elements of B fall into two classes: essences (objects) and \nappearances (of objects - what follows is true only of some rather \nstreamlined versions of B). Objects (events, etc.) may again combine. \nThey may form harmonious totalities where each part gives meaning \nto the whole and receives meaning from it (an extreme case is \nParmenides where isolated parts are not only unrecognizable, but \naltogether unthinkable). Aspects properly combined do not produce \nobjects, but psychological conditions for the apprehension of phantoms \nwhich are but other aspects, and particularly misleading ones at that \n(they look so convincing). No enumeration of aspeas is identical with the \nobject (problem of induction). \nThe transition from A to B thus introduces new entities and new \nrelations between entities (this is seen very clearly in painting and \nstatuary). It also changes the concept and the self-experience of \nhumans.

Indeed, it is not implausible to assume that some \noutstandinyJ>eculiarities ofB such as aspects, semblances, ambiguity \nof feeling1 \nenter the stage as a result of a sizeable increase of self­\nconsaousness. \nNow one might be inclined to explain the transition as follows: \narchaic man has a limited cosmology; he discovered some things, he \nmissed others. His universe lacks important objects, his language lacks \nimportant concepts, his perception lacks important structures. Add \nthe missing elements to cosmos A, the missing terms to language A, the \nmissing structures to the perceptual world of A, and you obtain cosmos \nB, language B, perception B. \nSome time ago I called the theory underlying such an explanation \nthe 'hole theory' or the 'Swiss cheese theory' oflanguage (and other \nmeans of representation). According to the hole theory every \ncosmology (every language, every mode of perception) has sizeable \nlacunae which can be filled, leaving everything else unchanged. The hole \ntheory is beset by numerous difficulties. In the present case there is the \ndifficulty that cosmos B does not contain a single element of cosmos A. \nNeither common-sense terms, nor philosophical theories; neither \npainting and statuary, nor artistic conceptions; neither religion, nor \ntheological speculation contain a single element of A once the \ntransition to B has been completed. This is a historical fact. 1 1 1  Is this \nI 08. 'Emotions do not spring spontaneously from man, but are bestowed on him \nby the gods,' ibid., p. 52.

Many presentations of A, including some \nvery detailed and sophisticated ones, are infected by B-concepts. An example is \nquoted in footnote 97 to the present chapter. Here \nas elsewhere only the \nanthropological method can lead to knowledge that is more than a reflection of wishful \nthinking. A similar situation in the course ofindividual development is described in the \ntext to fn. 12 of the present chapter. \n",

A-concepts are thus very similar to \nnotions such as 'checkmate': given a certain arrangement of pieces on \nthe board, there is no way of 'discovering' that the game can still be \ncontinued. Such a 'discovery' would not fil a gap, it would not add to \nour knowledge of possible chess positions, it would put an end to the \ngame. And so would the 'discovery' of 'real meanings' behind other \nmoves and other constellations. \nPrecisely the same remarks apply to the 'discovery' of an individual \nI that is different from faces, behaviour, objective 'mental states' of \nthe type that occur in A, to the 'discovery' of a substance behind \n'appearances' (formerly elements of A), or to the 'discovery' that \nhonour may be lacking despite the presence of al its outer \nmanifestations.

We have a point of view (theory, framework, cosmos, mode \nof representation) whose elements (concepts, 'facts', pictures) are \nbuilt up in accordance with certain principles of construction. The \nprinciples involve something like a 'closure': there are things that \ncannot be said, or 'discovered', without violating the principles \n(which does not mean contradicting them). Say the things, make the \ndiscovery, and the principles are suspended. Now take those \nconstructive principles that underlie every element of the cosmos (of \nthe theory), every fact (every concept). Let us call such principles \nuniversal principles of the theory in question. Suspending universal \nprinciples means suspending all facts and all concepts. Finally, let us \ncall a discovery, or a statement, or an attitude incommensurable with \nthe cosmos (the theory, the framework) if it suspends some of its \nuniversal principles.

The \nreason for the vagueness has already been explained (items 3 and 4 \nabove). The absence of logic is due to the fact that we deal with \nphenomena outside ofits domain.

The vagueness of the explanation \nreflects the incompleteness and complexity of the material and invites \narticulation by further research. The explanation has to have some \ncontent - otherwise it would be useless. But it must not have too much \ncontent, or else we have to revise it every second line. \nNote, also, that by a 'principle' I do not simply mean a statement \nsuch as 'concepts apply when a finite number of conditions is \nsatisfied', or 'knowledge is enumeration of discrete elements which \nform paratactic aggregates' but the grammatical habit corresponding \nto the statement. The two statements just quoted describe the habit \nof regarding an object as given when the list of its parts has been fully \npresented. This habit is suspended (though not contradicted) by the \nconjeaure that even the most complete list does not exhaust an object; \nit is also suspended (but again not contradicted) by any unceasing \nsearch for new aspects and new properties. (It is therefore not \nfeasible to define 'incommensurability' by reference to state­\nments. 1 17) If the habit is suspended, then A -objects are suspended \nwith it: one cannot examine A-objects by a method of conjectures \nand refutations that knows no end. \nHow is the 'irrationality' of the transition period overcome? It is \novercome in the usual way (cf. item 8 above), i.e. by the determined \nproduction of nonsense until the material produced is rich enough to \npermit the rebels to reveal, and everyone else to recognize, new \nuniversal principles. (Such revealing need not consist in writing the \nprinciples down in the form of clear and precise statements.) \nMadness turns into sanity provided it is sufficiently rich and \nsufficiently regular to function as the basis of a new world-view. And \nwhen that happens, then we have a new problem: how can the old \nview be compared with the new view? \nFrom what has been said it is obvious that we cannot compare the \ncontents of A and B. A-facts and B-facts cannot be put side by side, \nnot even in memory: presenting B-facts means suspending principles \n1 1 7. This takes care of a criticism in footnote 63 ofShapere's article in Mind and \nCosmos, Pittsburgh, 1966.

Thus \nevery fact of Newton's mechanics presumes that shapes, masses, \nperiods are changed only by physical interactions and this \npresumption is suspended by the theory of relativity. Similarly the \nquantum theory constitutes facts in accordance with the uncertainty \nrelations which are suspended by the classical approach. \nAt this point it is important to interpret the situation in a \nsensible manner of else scientific (cultural) change becomes an \ninexplicable miracle.

Incommensurability disappears when we use concepts \nas scientists use them, in an open, ambiguous and often counter­\nintuitive manner. Incommensurability is a problem for philosophers \nnot for scientists, though the latter may become psychologicaly \nconfused by unusual things. I arrived at the phenomenon while \nstudying the early literature on basic statements and by considering \nthe possibility of perceptions radically different from our own. In my \nthesis 10 I examined the meaning of observational statements. I \nconsidered the idea that such statements describe 'what is given' and \ntried to identify this 'given'. Phenomenologically this did not seem to be \npossible; we notice objects, their properties, their relations, not 'the \ngiven'. It is of course true that we can give quick reports on the \nproperties of everyday objects but this does not change them into \nnon-objects but only shows that we have a special relation to them. \nPhenomenologically what is given consists of the same things which \ncan also exist unobserved - it is not a new kind of object. Special \narrangements such as the reduction screen introduce new con­\nditions, they do not reveal ingredients in objects we already know. \nResult: the given cannot be isolated by observation. \nThe second possibility was to isolate it by logical means: what is \ngiven can be ascertained with certainty, hence I obtain the given \ncontained in the table before me by removing from the statement \n'there is a table' all the consequences that make future corrections \npossible. This shows that the given is the result of an unreasonable \ndecision: untestable statements cannot serve as a basis for science. \nFollowing this argument I introduced the assumption that the \nmeaning of observation statements depends on the nature of the \nobjects described and, as this nature depends on the most advanced \ntheories, on the content of these theories. Or as I formulated it in my \nfirst English paper on the topic: the interpretation of an observation \nlanguage is determined by the theories which we use to explain what \nwe observe, and it changes as soon as these theories change. 11 In a \nword: observation statements are not just theory-/aden (the views of \nToulmin, Hanson and apparently also Kuhn) but fully theoretical \nand the distinction between observation statements ('protocol \n10.

Thus in the same year \nas Hanson (Hanson's Pauerns o[Discuvery appeared in 1958) and four \nyears before Kuhn I formulated a thesis a weaker form of which \nbecame very popular later on. Moreover, my thesis not only was \nstronger than the thesis of theory-ladenness, it also came from a \ndifferent source. For while Toulmin and Hanson were inspired by \nWittgenstein's Philosophical lrrvestigations I started from and returned \nto ideas that had been developed in the Vienna Circle - and I said \nso. 12 Quine, whose philosophy shows close connections to the \nphilosophy of the Vienna Circle, 13 also used a criterion of \nobservability that is rather similar to mine. 14 \nNow when Feigl heard of these ideas he pointed out that \ninterpreting observations in \nterms \nof the theories they are \nobservations of makes nonsense of crucial experiments; for how can \nan experiment decide between two theories when its interpretation \nalready depends on these theories and when the theories themselves \nhave no common elements, such as a common observation language? \nIn the paper just mentioned and in 'Explanation, Reduction and \nEmpiricism', published in 1962, I took up the challenge. I first \nincreased it by constructing cases where important terms of one \ntheory cannot in any way be defined in another which, moreover, tries \nto do its job.

A powerful tribe invading a country \nmay impose its laws and change the indigenous traditions by force \nonly to be changed itself by the remnants of the subdued culture.

The observer asks: what happens and what is \ngoing to happen? The participant asks: what shall I do? Shall I \nsupport the interaction? Shall I oppose it? Or shall I simply forget \nabout it? \nIn the case of the Copernican Revolution, for example, the \nobserver asks: what impact did Copernicus have on Wittenberg \nastronomers at about 1 560? How did they react to his work? Did they \nchange some of their beliefs and if so, why?

Moreover this inability not only exists, it is \nalso encouraged as an attitude proper to those engaged in the study and \nthe improvement of man, society, knowledge. Hardly any religion has \never presented itself just as something worth trying. The claim is \nmuch stronger: the religion is the truth, everything else is error and \nthose who know it, understand it but still reject it are rotten to the \ncore (or hopeless idiots). \nTwo elements are contained in such a claim. First, one \ndistinguishes between traditions, practices and other results of \nindividual and/or collective human activity on the one side and a \ndifferent domain that may act on the traditions without being one. \nSecondly, one explains the structure of this special domain in detail. \nThus the word of God is powerful and must be obeyed not because \nthe tradition that carries it has much force, but because it is outside \nall traditions and provides a way of improving them. The word of \nGod can start a tradition, its meaning can be handed on from one \ngeneration to the next, but it is itself outside all traditions. \nThe first element - the belief that some demands are 'objective' \nand tradition-independent - plays an important role in rationalism \nwhich is a secularized form of the belief in the power of the word of \nGod. And this is how the opposition reason-practice obtains its \npolemical sting. For the two agencies are not seen as two practices \nwhich, while perhaps of unequal value, are yet both imperfect and \nchanging human products but as one such product on the one side \nand lasting measures of excellence on the other. Early Greek \nrationalism already contains this version of the conflict. Let us \nexamine what circumstances, assumptions, procedures - what \nfeatures of the historical process - are responsible for it! \nTo start with the traditions that oppose each other - Homeric \ncommon sense and the various forms of rationalism that arise in the \n6th to 4th centuries - have diferent internal structures.1 On the one \nhand we have complex ideas that cannot be easily explained, they \n'work' but one does not know how, they are 'adequate', but one does \nnot know why, they apply in special circumstances only, are rich in \ncontent but poor in similarities and, therefore, in deductive \nconnections.

The difference \nbecomes especially striking in the case of mathematics. In geometry, \nfor example, we start with rules of thumb applying to physical objects \nand their shapes under a great variety of circumstances. Later on it \ncan be pruved why a given rule applies to a given case - but the proofs \nmake use of new entities that are nowhere found in nature. \nIn antiquity the relation between the new entities and the familiar \nworld of common sense gave rise to various theories. One of them \nwhich one might call Platonism assumes that the new entities are real \nwhile the entities of common sense are but their imperfect copies. \nAnother theory, due to the Sophists, regards natural objects as real \nand the objects of mathematics (the objects of 'reason') as \nsimpleminded and unrealistic images of them. These two theories \nwere also applied to the difference between the new and fairly \nabstract idea of knowledge propagated by Plato (but found already \nbefore) and the common-sense knowledge of the time (Plato wisely \nuses a distorted image of the latter to give substance to the former). \nAgain it was either said that there existed only one true knowledge \nand that human opinion was but a pale shadow ofit or human opinion \nwas regarded as the only substantial knowledge in existence and the \nabstract knowledge of the philosophers as a useless dream ('I can see \nhorses, Plato,' said Antisthenes, 'but I nowhere see your ideal \nhorse'). \nIt would be interesting to follow this ancient conflict through \nhistory down to the present. One would then learn that the conflict \nturns up in many places and has many shapes. Two examples must \nsuffice to illustrate the great variety of its manifestations. \nWhen Gottsched wanted to reform the German theatre he looked \nfor plays worth imitating. That is, he looked for traditions more \norderly, more dignified, more respectable than what he found on the \nstage of his time. He was attracted by the French theatre and here \nmainly by Corneille. Being convinced that 'such a complex edifice of \npoetry (as tragedy) could hardly exist without rules'2 he looked for \nthe rules and found Aristotle. For him the rules of Aristotle were not \na particular way of viewing the theatre, they were the reason for \nexcellence where excellence was found and guides to improvement \nwhere improvement seemed necessary. Good theatre was an \nembodiment of the rules of Aristotle. Lessing gradually prepared a \ndifferent view. First he restored what he thought to be the real \n2.

If such a mind \nsucceeds in his efforts 'then let us forget the textbook!'3 \nIn a different (and much less interesting) domain we have the \nopposition between those who suggest that languages be constructed \nand reconstructed in accordance with simple and clear rules and who \nfavourably compare such idea/ languages with the sloppy and opaque \nnatural idioms and other philosophers who assert that natural \nlanguages, being adapted to a wide variety of circumstances, could \nnever be adequately replaced by their anaemic logical competitors. \nThis tendency to view differences in the structure of traditions \n(complex and opaque vs simple and clear) as differences in kind (real \nvs imperfect realization of it) is reinforced by the fact that the critics \nof a practice take an observer's position with respect to it but remain \nparticipants of the practice that provides them with their objections. \nSpeaking the language and using the standards of this practice they \n'discover' limitations, faults, errors when all that really happens is \nthat the two practices - the one that is being criticized and the one \nthat does the criticizing - don't fit each other. Many arguments against \nan out-and-out materialism are of this kind.

But that does not make \nthem 'objective' and independent of traditions. To infer from the \nabsence of terms concerning subjects or groups in 'there ought to \nbe . . .

The \nfact that the retort to 'you ought to do X' can be 'that's what you \nthink!' shows that the same is true of value statements. And those \ncases where the reply is not allowed can be easily rectified by using \ndiscoveries in value theory that correspond to the discovery of \nalternative geometries, or alternative logical systems: we confront \n'objective' value judgement from different cultures or different \npractices and ask the objectivist how he is going to resolve the \nconflict.4 Reduction to shared principles is not always possible and \nso we must admit that the demands or the formulae expressing them \n4.

Small wonder our 'rationalists' are fascinated by them. \nWith this we have also our answer to (b). It is true that stating a \ndemand and describing a practice may be two different things and \nthat logical connections cannot be established between them. This \ndoes not mean that the interaction between demands and practices \ncannot be treated and evaluated as an interaction of practices. For the \ndifference is due, first, to a difference between observer-attitude and \nparticipant-attitude: one side, the side defending the 'objectivity' of \nits values, uses its tradition instead of examining it - which does not \ntum the tradition into an objective measure of validity.

Reason receives both its content and its authority from practice. \nIt describes the way in which practice works and formulates its \nunderlying principles. This version has been called naturalism and it \nhas occasionally been attributed to Hegel (though erroneously so). \nBoth idealism and naturalism have difficulties. \nThe difficulties of idealism are that the idealist does not only want \nto 'act rationally' he also wants his rational actions to have results. \nAnd he wants these results to occur not only among the idealizations \nhe uses but in the real world he inhabits.

This \nconflict between rationality and expectations was one of the main \nreasons for the constant reform of the canons of rationality and much \nencouraged naturalism. \nBut naturalism is not satisfactory either.

Basing standards on a practice and \nleaving it at that may forever perpetuate the shortcomings of this \npractice. \nThe difficulties of naturalism and idealism have certain elements \nin common. The inadequacy of standards often becomes clear from \nthe barrenness of the practice they engender, the shortcomings of \npractices often are very obvious when practices based on different \nstandards flourish. This suggests that reason and practice are not two \ndifferent kinds of entities but parts of a single dia/eaical process. \nThe suggestion can be illustrated by the relation between a map \nand the adventures of a person using it or by the relation between an \nartisan and his instruments.

The wanderer uses the map to find his way but \nhe also corrects it as he proceeds, removing old idealizations and \nintroducing new ones. Using the map no matter what will soon get \nhim into trouble. But it is better to have maps than to proceed without \nthem.

They are both needed but reason can exist without \na practice and practice can exist without reason. Shall we accept this \naccount of the matter? \nTo answer the question we need only remember that the \ndifference between 'reason' and something 'unreasonable' that must \nbe formed by it or can be used to put it in its place arose from turning \nstructural differences of practices into differences of kind. Even the \nmost perfect standards or rules are not independent of the material \non which they act (how else could they find a point of attack in it?) and \nwe would hardly understand them or know how to use them were \nthey not well-integrated parts of a rather complex and in places quite \nopaque practice or tradition, viz. the language in which the defensor \nrationis expresses his stem commands. 7 On the other hand even the \nmost disorderly practice is not without its regularities, as emerges \nfrom our attitude towards non-participants.8 What is called 'reason ' \nand 'practice' are therefore two diferent types of practice, the difference \nbeing that the one clearly exhibits some simple and easily producible \nformal aspects, thus making us forget the complex and hardly \nunderstood properties that guarantee the simplicity and producibility, \nwhile the other drowns the formal aspects under a great variety of \naccidental properties. But complex and implicit reason is still reason \nand a practice with simple formal features hovering above a pervasive \nbut unnoticed background of linguistic habits is still a practice. \nDisregarding (or, rather, not even noticing) the sense-giving and \napplication-guaranteeing mechanism in the first case and the implicit \nregularities in the second a rationalist perceives law and order here \nand material yet in need of being shaped there. The habit, also \ncommented upon in an earlier part of this section, to take a \nparticipant's point of view with respect to the former and an \n7. This point has been made with great force and with the help of many examples \nby Wittgenstein (cf. my essay 'Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations', Phil Rev., \n1955). What have rationalists replied? Russell (coldly): 'I don't understand.' Sir Karl \nPopper (breathlessly): 'He is right, he is right- I don't understand it either!' In a word: \nthe point is irrelevant because leading rationalists don't understand it. I, on the other \nhand, would start doubting the intelligence (and perhaps also the inte.llectual honesty) \nof rationalists who don't understand (or pretend not to understand) such a simple \npoint. \n8.

And so we have finally two agencies, \nstem and orderly reason on the one side, a malleable but not entirely \nyielding material on the other, and with this all the 'problems of \nrationality' that have provided philosophers with intellectual (and, let \nus not forget, also with financial) nourishment ever since the 'Rise of \nRationalism in the West'. One cannot help noticing that the \narguments that are still used to support this magnificent result are \nindistinguishable from those of the theologian who infers a creator \nwherever he sees some kind of order: obviously order is not inherent \nin matter and so must have been imposed from the outside. \nThe interaction view must therefore be supplemented with a \nsatisfactory account of the interacting agencies. Presented in this way \nit becomes a triviality. For there is no tradition no matter how hard­\nheaded its scholars and how hard-limbed its warriors that will remain \nunaffected by what occurs around it. At any rate - what changes, and \nhow, is now a matter either for historical research or for political action \ncarried out by those who participate in the interacting traditions. \nI shall now state the implications of these results in a series of theses \nwith corresponding explanations. \nWe have seen that rational standards and the arguments supporting \nthem are visible parts of special traditions consisting of clear and \nexplicit principles and an unnoticed and largely unknown but \nahsolutely necessary background of dispositions for action and \njm.a6ement. The standards become 'objective' measures of excel­\nlence when adopted by participants of traditions of this kind. We have \nthen 'objective' rational standards and arguments for their validity. \nWe have further seen that there are other traditions that also lead to \njudgements though not on the basis of explicit standards and \nprinciples. These value judgements have a more 'immediate' \ncharacter, but they are still evaluations, just like those of the \nrationalist. In both cases judgements are made by individuals who \nparticipate in traditions and use them to separate 'Good' from 'Evil'. \nWe can therefore state: \ni. Traditions are neither good nor bad, they simply are. 'Objectively \nspeaking', i.e. independently of participation in a tradition, there is \nnot much to choose between humanitarianism and anti-Semitism. \nCorollary: rationality is not an arbiter of traditions, it is itself a \ntradition or an aspect of a tradition. It is therefore neither good nor \nbad, it simply is. \n",

A tradition assumes desirable or undesirable properties only when \ncompared with some tradition, i.e. only when viewed by participants \nwho see the world in terms of its values. The projections of these \nparticipants appear objeaive and statements describing them sound \nobjeaive because the participants and the tradition they project are \nnowhere mentioned in them. They are subjeaive because they depend \non the tradition chosen and on the use the participants make of it. \nThe subjectivity is noticed as soon as participants realize that \ndifferent traditions give rise to different judgements. They will then \nhave to revise the content of their value statements just as physicists \nrevised the content of even the simplest statement concerning length \nwhen it was discovered that length depends on reference systems and \njust as everybody revised the content of 'down' when it was \ndiscovered that the earth is spherical. Those who don't carry out the \nrevision cannot pride themselves on forming a special school of \nespecially astute philosophers who have overcome moral relativism, \njust as those who still cling to absolute lengths cannot pride \nthemselves on forming a special school of especially astute physicists \nwho have overcome relativity.

Others take it for granted that there is only one way of \nmaking people accept their views.

Argument is propaganda \nfor one observer, the essence of human discourse for another. \nv. We have seen that individuals or groups participating in the \ninteraction of traditions may adopt a pragmatic philosophy when \njudging the events and structures that arise. The principles of their \nphilosophy often emerge only during the interaction (people change \nwhile observing change or participating in it and the traditions they \nuse may change with them).

(1) \nthere is no decision but a natural development leading to traditions \nwhich in retrospect give reasons for the action had it been a decision \nin accordance with standards or (2) to ask how one will judge and \nchoose in as yet unknown surroundings makes as much sense as to \nask what measuring instruments one will use in as yet unexplored \ndomains.

Education is separated from decisive \ndebates, it occurs at an early stage and guarantees that the grown-ups \nwill behave properly. A rational debate is a special case of a guided \nexchange. If the participants are rationalists then all is well and the \ndebate can start right away. If only some participants are rationalists \nand if they have power (an important consideration!) then they will \nnot take their collaborators seriously until they have also become \nrationalists: a society based on rationality is not entirely free; one has \nto play the game of the intellectuals.10 \nAn open exchange, on the other hand, is guided by a pragmatic \nphilosophy.

These problems are not solved by a change of standards \nbut by taking a different view of standards altogether. \nIdealism can be dogmatic and it can be critical. In the first case the \nrules proposed are regarded as final and unchangeable; in the second \ncase there is the possibility of discussion and change. But the \ndiscussion does not take practices into account - it remains restricted \nto an abstract domain of standards, rules and logic. \nThe limitation of all rules and standards is recognized by naive \nanarchism. A naive anarchist says (a) that both absolute rules and \ncontext-dependent rules have their limits and infers (b) that all rules \nand standards are worthless and should be given up. Most reviewers \nregard me as a naive anarchist in this sense, overlooking the many \npassages where I show how certain procedures aided scientists in \ntheir research. For in my studies of Galileo, of Brownian motion, \nof the Presocratics I not only demonstrate the failures of familiar \nstandards, I also try to show what not so familiar procedures \ndid actually succeed.

Moreover, I suggest a \nnew relation between rules and practices. It is this relation and not any \nparticular rule-content that characterizes the position I wish to \ndefend. \nThis position adopts some elements of naturalism but it rejects the \nnaturalist philosophy. According to naturalism rules and standards \nare obtained by an analysis of traditions. As we have seen the problem \nis which tradition to choose. Philosophers of science will of course \nopt for science as their basic tradition. But science is not one tradition, \nit is many, and so it gives rise to many and partly incompatible \nstandards (I have explained this difficulty in my discussion of \nLakatos).1 Besides, the procedure makes it impossible for the \nphilosopher to give reasons for his choice of science over myth \n1 .

Naturalism cannot solve the problem of scientific \nrationality. \nAs in Chapter 17 we can now compare the drawbacks of \nnaturalism and idealism and arrive at a more satisfactory view. \nNaturalism says that reason is completely detennined by research. Of \nthis we retain the idea that research can change reason. Idealism says \nthat reason completely guverns research. Of this we retain the idea \nthat reason can change research. Combining the two elements we \narrive at the idea of a guide who is part of the activity guided and \nis changed by it. This corresponds to the interactionist view of \nreason and practice formulated in Chapter 17 and illustrated by \nthe example of the map. Now the interactionist view assumes \ntwo different entities, a disembodied guide on the one side and a \nwell-endowed practice on the other. But the guide seems dis­\nembodied only because its 'body', i.e. the very substantial practice \nthat underlies it, is not noticed and the 'practice' seems crude and in \nneed of a guide only because one is not aware of the complex and \nrather sophisticated laws it contains. Thus the problem is not the \ninteraction of a practice with something different and external, but the \ndevelopment of one tradition under the impact of others. A look at the way \nin which science treats its problems and revises its 'standards' \nconfirms this picture. \nIn physics theories are used both as descriptions of facts and as \nstandards of speculation and factual accuracy. Measuring instruments \nare constructed in accordance with laws and their readings are tested \nunder the assumption that these laws are correct. In a similar way \ntheories giving rise to physical principles provide standards to judge \nother theories by: theories that are relativistically invariant are better \nthan theories that are not. Such standards are of course not \nuntouchable. The standard of relativistic invariance, for example, \nmay be removed when one discovers that the theory of relativity has \nserious shortcomings. Shortcomings are occasionally found by a \ndirect examination of the theory, for example by an examination ofits \nmathematics, or its predictive success. They may also be found by the \ndevelopment of alternatives (cf. Chapter 3) - i.e. by research that \nviolates the standards to be examined. \nThe idea that nature is infinitely rich both qualitatively and \nquantitatively leads to the desire to make new discoveries and thus to \na principle of content increase which gives us another standard to \njudge theories by: theories that have excess content over what is \nalready known are preferable to theories that have not.

The standards ·we use and the rules we recommend \nmake sense only in a world that has a certain structure. They become \ninapplicable, or start running idle in a domain that does not exhibit \nthis structure.

The demand for \ncontent increase now became very plausible. It arose from the wish to \ndiscover more and more of a nature that seemed to be infinitely rich \nin extent and quality. The demand has no point in a finite world that \nis composed of a finite number of basic qualities. \nHow do we find the cosmology that supports or suspends our \nstandards?

We make the discovery when developing \ntheories that conflict with observation and finding that they excel in \nmany other respects (Chapters 5 to 1 1  describe how Galileo \ncontributed to the discovery). \nFinally, the idea that things are well defined and that we do not live \nin a paradoxical world leads to the standard that our knowledge must \nbe self-consistent.

A procedure not in agreement with this standard is not \nresearch - it is chaos. It is therefore not possible to examine non­\ncontradiction in the manner described in the last example. \nThe main part of the objection is the second statement and it is \nusually supported by the remark that a contradiction implies every \nstatement. This it does - but only in rather simple logical systems. \nNow it is clear that changing standards or basic theories has \nrepercussions that must be taken care of. Admitting velocities larger \nthan the velocity of light into relativity and leaving everything else \nunchanged gives us some rather puzzling results such as imaginary \nmasses . and velocities. \nAdmitting well-defined positions \nand \nmomenta into the quantum theory and leaving everything else \nunchanged creates havoc with the laws of interference. Admitting \ncontradictions into a system of ideas allegedly connected by the laws \nof standard logic and leaving everything else unchanged makes us \nassert every statement. Obviously we shall have to make some further \nchanges, for example we shall have to change some rules of \nderivation in the last case. Carrying out the change removes the \nproblems and research can proceed as planned. (Scientific practice \ncontaining inconsistencies is already arranged in the right way.) \nBut - says an objection that is frequently raised at this point: how \nwill the results of the research be evaluated if fundamental standards \nhave been removed? For example, what standards show that research \nin violation of content increase produces theories which are 'beter \nthan their infinitist rivals' as I said a few paragraphs ago? Or what \nstandards show that theories in conflict with observations have \nsomething to offer while their observationally impeccable rivals have \nnot? Does not a decision to accept unusual theories and to reject \nfamiliar ones assume standards and is it not clear, therefore, that \ncosmological investigations cannot try to provide alternatives to all \nstandards?

It is not difficult to answer them. \nIt is asked how research leading to the revision of standards is to be \nevaluated. For example, when and on what grounds shall we be \nsatisfied that research containing inconsistencies has revealed a fatal \nshortcoming of the standard of non-contradiction? The question \nmakes as little sense as the question what measuring instruments will \nhelp us to explore an as yet unspecified region of the universe. We \ndon't know the region, we cannot say what will work in it. To advance \nwe must either enter the region, or start making conjectures about it. \nWe enter the region by articulating unusual intellectual, social, \nemotional tendencies, no matter how strange they may seem when \nviewed through the spectacles of established theories or standards. It \nwould certainly be silly to disregard physical features that do not agree \nwith deeply ingrained spiritual notions. But it is equally shortsighted \nto curtail fantasies that do not seem to fit into the physical universe. \nFantasies and, in fact, the entire subjectivity of human beings are just \nas much a part of the world as fleas, stones and quarks and there is no \nreason why we should change them to protect the latter. \nSimilar considerations apply to the standards that are supposed to \nguide our thoughts and actions. They are not stable and they cannot \nbe stabilized by tying them to a particular point of view. For Aristotle \nknowledge was qualitative and observational. Today knowledge is \nquantitative and theoretical, at least as far as our leading natural \nscientists are concerned. Who is right? That depends on what kind of \ninformation has privileged status and this in tum depends on the \nculture, or the 'cultural leaders' who use the information. Many \npeople, without much thought, prefer technology to harmony with \nNature; hence, quantitative and theoretical information is regarded \nas 'real' and qualities as 'apparent' and secondary. But a culture that \ncentres on humans, prefers personal acquaintance to abstract \nrelations (intelligence quotients; efficiency statistics) and a naturalists' \napproach to that of molecular biologists will say that knowledge is \nqualitative and will interpret quantitative laws as bookkeeping \ndevices, not as elements of reality. \nCombining the considerations of the last two paragraphs we see \nthat even the apparently hardest scientific 'fact' can be dissolved by \ndecisions undermining the values that make it a fact and/ or by \nresearch that replaces it by facts of a different kind. This is not \na new procedure. Philosophers from Parmenides to 20th-century \n(undialectical) materialists and scientists from Galileo and Descartes \nto Monod used it to devalue, and to declare as mere appearance, the \nqualitative features of human life.

The idea that ' \"scientific\" knowledge is in \nsome way peculiarly positive and free from differences of opinion'12 \nis nothing but a chimaera. \nThe situation in the arts is quite similar - as a matter of fact, it \noccurs in all areas of human activity. Cennino Cennini's Libro \ndeii'Arte of 1390 contains practical advice based on a rich experience \nand complex skills. Leon Battista Alberti's Della Pinura of 14 35/6 is a \ntheoretical treatise closely tied to central perspective and academic \noptical theory. Perspective soon became a mania among artists. \nLeonardo and Raphael then pointed out, the one in words, the other \npractically (cf. the sphere on the right hand side of his School of Athens \nin the Stanza della Segnatura of the Vatican), that a picture that is to \nbe viewed under normal circumstances, from a comfortable but not \nwell-defined distance and with both eyes wide open cannot obey the \nrules of central perspective. They thereby clarified the difference \nbetween physiological optics and geometrical optics which Kepler, \nmore than a century later, still tried to bridge by an easily refuted \nhypothesis (cf. Ch. 9, text to footnote 50). But central perspective \nremained a basis on which various changes were superimposed. \nSo far I have been talking about procedure, or method. Now \nmethods that are not used as a matter of habit, without any thought \nabout the reasons behind them, are often tied to metaphysical beliefs. \nFor example, a radical form of empiricism assumes either that \nhumans are the measure of things or that they are in harmony with \nthem. Applied consistently methodological rules may produce results \nwhich agree with the corresponding metaphysics. Luria's procedure \nis an example. It did not fail; it helped to build a subject which today is \nat the forefront of research. Einstein's approach did not end in \ndisaster; it led to one of the most fascinating modem theories -\ngeneral relativity. But methods are not restricted to the area where \nthey scored their first triumphs. Luria's requirements, for example, \nalso turned up in cosmology; they had been used by Heber Curtis, in \nhis 'grand debate' with Harlow Shapely; by Ambarzumjan, who \nopposed empiricism to abstract principles; and they are now being \napplied by Halton Arp, Margaret Geller and their collaborators. \nWhatever the results, a world built up in the manner of Luria has \n12.

Johann Theodore \nMerz describes in detail how abstract world-views using cor­\nresponding methods produced results which slowly filled them with \nempirical content. 13 He discusses the following views. First, the \nastronomical view, which rested on mathematical refinements of \naction at a distance laws and was extended (by Coulomb, Neumann, \nAmpere and others) to electricity and magnetism. Laplace's theory of \ncapillarity was an outstanding achievement of this approach. \nSecondly, the atomic view, which played an important role in chemical \nresearch (example: stereochemistry) but was also opposed by \nchemists. Thirdly, the kinetic and mechanical view, which employed \natoms in the area ofheat and electric phenomena. For some scientists \natomism was the foundation of everything. Fourthly, the physical view, \nwhich tried to achieve universality in a different way, on the basis of \ngeneral notions such as the notion of energy. It could be connected \nwith the kinetic view, but often was not. Physicians, physiologists and \nchemists like Mayer, Helmholtz, du Bois Reymond and, in the \npractical area, Liebig were outstanding representatives of this view in \nthe second half of the 19th century while Ostwald, Mach and Duhem \nextended it into the 20th. Starting his description of the morphological \nview, Merz writes: \nThe different aspects of nature which I have reviewed in the foregoing \nchapters and the various sciences which have been elaborated by their \naid, comprise what may appropriately be termed the abstract study of \nnatural objects and phenomena. Though all the methods of reasoning \nwith which we have so far become acquainted originated primarily \nthrough observation and the reflection over things natural, they have \nthis in common that they - for the purpose of examination - remove \ntheir objects out of the position and surroundings which nature has \nassigned to them: that they abstract them. This process of abstraction \nis either literally a process of removal from one place to another, from \nthe great work - and storehouse of nature herself to the small \nworkroom, the laboratory of the experimenter; or - where such \nremoval is not possible - the process is carried out merely in the realm \nof contemplation; one or two special properties are noted and \ndescribed, whilst the number of collateral data are for the moment \ndisregarded.

Extended to 1 ,000 megaparsec, Geller's \nresearch may blow up the entire subject. We have a rabid materialism \nin some parts (molecular biology, for example), a modest to radical \nsubjectivism in others (some versions of quantum measurement, \nanthropic principle). There are many fascinating results, specula­\ntions, attempts at interpretation and it is certainly worth knowing \nthem. But pasting them together into a single coherent 'scientific' \nworld-view, a procedure which has the blessings even of the Pope17 \n- this is going too far. After all, who can say that the world which so \nstrenuously resists unification really is as educators and meta­\nphysicians want it to be - tidy, uniform, the same everywhere? \nBesides, as was shown in Chapters 3 ff, a paste job eliminates \nprecisely those conflicts that kept science going in the past and will \ncontinue inspiring its practitioners if preserved. \nAt this point some defenders of uniformity rise to a higher level. \nScience may be complex, they say, but it is still 'rational'. Now the \nword 'rational' can either be used as a collecting bag for a variety of \nprocedures - this would be its nominalist interpretation - or it \ndescribes a general feature found in every single scientific action. I \naccept the first definition, but I reject the second. In the second case \nrationality is either defined in a narrow way that excludes, say, the \narts; then it also excludes large sections of the sciences. Or it is \ndefined in a way that lets all of science survive; then it also applies to \nlove-making, comedy and dogfights. There is no way of delimiting \n'science' by something stronger and more coherent than a list. \nI come to the second question -what's so great about science? There \nare various measures of greatness. Popularity, i.e. familiarity with \nsome results and the belief that they are important, is one of them. \nNow it is true that despite periodic swings towards the sciences and \naway from them they are still in high repute with the general public -\nor, rather, not the sciences, but a mythical monster 'science' (in the \nsingular - in German it sounds even more impressive: Die \nWissenschaft). For what the general public seems to assume is that the \nachievements they read about in the educational pages of their \nnewspapers and the threats they seem to perceive come from a single \nsource and are produced by a uniform procedure.

Adding that scientists keep complaining about the scientific \nilliteracy of the general public and that by the 'general public' they \nmean the Western middle class, not Bolivian peasants (for example), \nwe have to conclude that the popularity of science is a very doubtful \nmatter indeed. \nWhat about practical advantages? The answer is that 'science' \nsometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Some sciences (economic \ntheory, for example) are in a pretty sorry shape. Others are \nsufficiently mobile to tum disaster into triumph. The can do so because \nthey are not tied to any particular method or world-view. The fact that an \napproach is 'scientific' according to some clearly formulated criterion \ntherefore is no guarantee that it will succeed. Each case must be judged \nseparately, especially today, when the fear ofindustrial espionage, the \nwish to overtake competitors on the way to a Nobel Prize, the uneven \ndistribution of funds, national rivalries, fear of accusations (of \nmalpractice, plagiarism, waste of funds, etc.) put restrictions on what \nsome dreamers, many philoso%hers among them, still regard as a \n'free intellectual adventure'. 8 The question of truth, finally, \nremains unresolved. Love of truth is one of the strongest motives for \nreplacing what really happens by a streamlined account, or, to \nexpress it in a less polite manner, love of truth is one of the strongest \nmotives for lying to oneself and to others. Besides, the quantum \ntheory seems to show, in the precise manner so much beloved by the \nadmirers of science, that reality is either one, which means there are \nno observers and no things observed, or it is many, in which case what \nis found does not exist in itself but depends on the approach chosen. \nWhat are the views that are being compared with science when it is \ndeclared to be superior? E.O. Wilson, the 'father' of sociobiology, \nwrites: \nreligion .\n. . will endure for a long time as a vital force in society. Like \nthe mythical giant Antaeus who drew energy from his mother, the \nearth, religion cannot be defeated by those who may cast it down.

I regard this as a somewhat narrow characterization. World­\nviews also answer questions about origins and purposes which sooner \nor later arise in almost every human being. Answers to these \nquestions were available to Kepler and Newton and were used by \nthem in their research; they are no longer available today, at least not \nwithin the sciences. They are part of non-scientific world-views \nwhich therefore have much to offer, also to scientists. When Western \nCivilization invaded what is now called the Third World it imposed \nits own ideas of a proper environment and a rewarding life. It thereby \ndisrupted delicate patterns of adaptation and created problems that \nhad not existed before. Both human decency and some appreciation \nof the many ways in which humans can live with nature prompted \nagents of development and public health to think in more complex or, \nas some would say, more 'relativistic' ways. There exist approaches, \nthe approach called 'Primary environmental Care' among them, \nwhich offer legal, political and scientific information but modified in \naccordance with the needs, the wishes and, what is most important, \nthe skills and the knowledge of local populations. 20 Similarly, the \nmovement called liberation theology has modified Church doctrine \nto bring it closer to the spiritual needs of the poor and disadvantaged, \nespecially in South America. \nLet me point out, incidentally, that not all ideas which seem \nrepulsive to the prophets of a New Age come from science. The idea \nof a world machine and the related idea that nature is material to be \nshaped by man should not be blamed on modern, i.e. post-Cartesian, \nscience. It is older and stronger than a purely philosophical doctrine \ncould ever be. The expression 'world machine' is found in Pseudo \nDionysius Areopagita, a mystic of unknown identity who wrote about \n500 AD and had tremendous influence. Oresme, who died in 1382 \nas bishop of Lisieux, compares the universe to a vast mechanical \nclock set running by God so that 'all the wheels move as \nharmoniously as possible'.

An example is medicine, which, \nthough not a science, has increasingly been connected with scientific \nresearch. There are many fashions and schools in medicine just as \nthere are many fashions and schools in psychology. It follows, first, \nthe idea of a comparison of 'Western medicine' with other medical \nprocedures does not make sense. Secondly, such a comparison is \noften against the law, even if there should be volunteers: a test is \nlegally impossible.

It shows fear, indecision, a \nyearning for authority and a disregard for the new opportunities that \nnow exist: we can build world-views on the basis of a personal choice \nand thus unite, for ourselves and for our friends, what was once \nseparated by a series of historical accidents. 22 \nOn the other hand, we can agree that in a world full of scientific \nproducts scientists may be given a special status just as henchmen \nhad a special status at times of social disorder or priests had when \nbeing a citizen coincided with being the member of a single universal \nChurch. We can also agree that appealing to a chimaera (such as that \nof a uniform and coherent 'scientific world-view') can have important \npolitical consequences. In 1854 Commander Perry, using force, \nopened the ports of Hakodate and Shimoda to American ships for \nsupply and trade. This event demonstrated the military inferiority of \nJapan. The members of the Japanese enlightenment of the early \n1870s, Fukuzawa among them, now reasoned as follows. Japan can \nkeep its independence only if it becomes stronger. It can become \nstronger only with the help of science. It will use science effectively \nonly if it does not just practise science but also believes in the \nunderlying ideology. To many traditional Japanese this ideology ­\n'the' scientific world-view - was barbaric. But, so the followers of \nFukuzawa argued, it was necessary to adopt barbaric ways, to regard \nthem as advanced, to introduce the whole of Western Civilization in \norder to survive. 23 Having been thus prepared Japanese scientists \nsoon branched out as their Western colleagues had done before and \nfalsified the uniform ideology that had started the development. The \nlesson I draw from this sequence of events is that a uniform 'scientific \nview of the world' may be useful.forpeopledoingscience- it gives them \nmotivation without tying them down. It is like a flag. Though \npresenting a single pattern it makes people do many different things. \nHowever, it is a disaster for outsiders (philosophers, fly-by-night \nmystics, prophets of a New Age). It suggests to them the most \nnarrowminded religious commitment and encourages a similar \nnarrowmindedness on their part. \n22. Wolfgang Pauli, who was deeply concerned about the intellectual situation of \nthe time, demanded that science and religion again be united: letter to M. Fierz, 8 \nAugust 1948. I agree hut would add, entirely in the spirit of Pauli, that the unification \nshould be a personal matter; it should not be prepared by philosophical-scientific \nalchemists of the mind and imposed by their minions in education.

The objection that science is \nself-correcting and thus needs no outside interference overlooks, \nfirst, that every enterprise is self-correcting (look at what happened to \nthe Catholic Church after Vatican II) and, secondly, that in a \ndemocracy the self-correction of the whole which tries to achieve \nmore humane ways ofliving overrules the self-correction of the parts \nwhich has a more narrow aim - unless the parts are given temporary \nindependence.

Anger at the \nwanton destruaion of cultural achievements from which we all could have \nlearned, at the conceited assurance with which some intelleauals interfere \nwith the lives of people, and contempt for the treacly phrases they use to \nembellish their misdeeds was and still is the motive force behind my work. \nThe problem ofknowledge and education in a free society first struck \nme during my tenure of a state fellowship at the Weimar lnstitut zur \nMethodologischen Emeuerung des Deutschen Theaters (1946), \nwhich was a continuation of the Deutsches Theater Moskau under \nthe directorship of Maxim Vallentin. Staff and students of the lnstitut \nperiodically visited theatres in Eastern Germany. 1 A special train \nI .  Like many people of my generation I was involved in the Second World War. This \nevent had little influence on my thinking. For me the war was a nuisance, not a moral \nproblem. Before the war I had intended to study astronomy, acting and singing and to \npractise these professions simultaneously. I had excellent teachers (Adolf Vogel, my \nsinging teacher, had an international reputation and taught outstanding opera singers \nsuch as Norman Bayley) and had just overcome some major vocal difficulties when I \nreceived my draft notice (I was eighteen at the time). How inconvenient, I thought. Why \nthe hell should I participate in the war games of a bunch of idiots? How do I get out ofit? \nVarious attempts misfired and I became a soldier. I applied for officers' training to avoid \nbullets as long as possible. The attempt was not entirely successful; I was a lieutenant \nbefore the war had come to an end and found myselfin the middle of the German retreat \nin Poland and then in East Germany, surrounded by fleeing civilians, infantry units, \ntanks, Polish auxiliaries whom I suddenly commanded (the higher officers quickly \ndisappeared when matters became sticky). The whole colourful chaos then appeared to \nme like a stage and I became careless. A bullet hit me on my right hand, a second bullet \ngrazed my face, a third got stuck in my spine, I fell to the ground, unable to rise, but with \nthe happy thought 'the war is over for me, now at last I can return to singing and my \nbeloved astronomy books'. It was only much later that I became aware of the moral \nproblems of the entire age. It seems to me that these problems are still with us. They arise \nwhenever an individual or a group objectivizes its own personal conceptions of a god \nlife and acts accordingly. Cf. Farewell to Reason, pp. 309fT.

After each performance the public was \nasked to remain seated while we started a discussion of what we had \njust seen. There were classical plays, but there were also new plays \nwhich tried to analyse recent events. Most of the time they dealt with \nthe work of the resistance in Nazi Germany. They were indistin­\nguishable from earlier Nazi plays eulogizing the activity of the Nazi \nunderground in democratic countries. In both cases there were \nideological speeches, outbursts of sincerity and dangerous situations \nin the cops and robbers tradition. This puzzled me and I commented \non it in the debates: how should a play be structured so that one \nrecognizes it as presenting the 'good side'? What has to be added to \nthe action to make the struggle of the resistance fighter appear \nmorally superior to the struggle of an illegal Nazi in Austria before \n1938? It is not sufficient to give him the 'right slogans' for then we \ntake his superiority for granted, we do not show wherein it consists. \nNor can his nobility, his 'humanity' be the distinguishing mark; every \nmovement has scoundrels as well as noble people among its \nfollowers. A playwright may of course decide that sophistication is \nluxury in moral battles and give a black-white account. He may lead \nhis followers to victory but at the expense of turning them into \nbarbarians. What, then, is the solution?

I don't know \nwhether this was because of any deep conviction of mine, or because I \nwas carried along by events, or because of the magnificent art of \nEisenstein.

If he \nerrs it should be on the side of sympathy for his scoundrels, for \ncircumstances and suffering play as large a role in the creation of evil \nand evil intentions as do those intentions themselves, and the general \ntendency is to emphasize the latter. The playwright (and his \ncolleague, the teacher) must not try to anticipate the decision \nof the audience (of the pupils) or replace it by a decision of his \nown if they should tum out to be incapable of making up their \nown minds. Under no circumstances must he try to be a 'moral force'. \nA moral force, whether for good or for evil, turns people into slaves \nand slavery, even slavery in the service of The Good, or of God \nHimself, is the most abject condition of all.

Juhos, Heintel, Hollitscher, von Wright, \nAnscombe, Wittgenstein came to our meetings and debated with \nus.

The Society had been founded in 1945 by Austrian \nresistance fighters3 to provide a forum for the exchange of scholars \nand ideas and so to prepare the political unification of Europe.

The difficulties of scientific \nrationality were made very clear by \n(3) Felix Ehrenhaft, who arrived in Vienna in 1 947. We, the \nstudents of physics, mathematics, astronomy, had heard a lot about \nhim . We knew that he was an excellent experimenter and that his \nlectures were performances on a grand scale which his assistants had \nto prepare for hours in advance. We knew that he had taught \ntheoretical physics which was as exceptional for an experimentalist \nthen as it is now. We were also familiar with the persistent rumours \nthat denounced him as a charlatan. Regarding ourselves as defenders \nof the purity of physics we looked forward to exposing him in public. \nAt any rate our curiosity was aroused -and we were not disappointed. \nEhrenhaft was a mountain of a man, full of vitality and unusual \nideas. His lectures compared favourably (or unfavourably, depend­\ning on the point of view) with the more refined performances of his \ncolleagues. 'Are you dumb? Are you stupid? Do you really agree with \neverything I say?' he shouted at us who had intended to expose him \nbut sat in silent astonishment at his performance. The question was \nmore than justified for there were large chunks to swallow. Relativity \nand quantum theory were rejected at once, and almost as a matter of \ncourse, for being idle speculation. In this respect Ehrenhaft' s attitude \nwas very close to that of Stark and Lenard both of whom he \nmentioned with approval. But he went further and criticized the \nfoundations of classical physics as well. The first thing to be removed \nwas the law of inertia: undisturbed objects instead of going in a \nstraight line were supposed to move in a helix. Then came a sustained \nattack on the principles of electromagnetic theory and especially \non the equation div B \n= 0. Many years before the fundamental \ndebate he produced convincing evidence for mesoscopic magnetic \nmonopoles. Then new and surprising properties of light were \ndemonstrated - and so on and so forth. Each demonstration was \naccompanied by a few gently ironical remarks on 'school physics' and \nthe 'theoreticians' who built castles in the air without considering the \nexperiments which Ehrenhaft devised and continued devising in all \nfields and which produced a plethora of inexplicable results. \nWe had soon an opportunity to witness the attitude of orthodox \nphysicists.

There are a few \nparadigmatic cases where the theory can be applied without major \nadjustments but the rest must be dealt with by occasionally rather \ndoubtful approximations and auxiliary assumptions. 4 I find it \ninteresting to remember how little effect all this had on us at the time. \nWe continued to prefer abstractions as if the difficulties we had \nfound had not been an expression of the nature of things but could be \nremoved by some ingenious device, yet to be discovered. Only much \nlater did Ehrenhaft's lesson sink in and our attitude at the time as well \nas the attitude of the entire profession provided me then with an \nexcellent illustration of the nature of scientific rationality. \n(4) Philipp Frank came to Alpbach a few years after Ehrenhaft. He \nundermined common ideas of rationality in a different way by \nshowing that the arguments against Copernicus had been perfectly \nsound and in agreement with experience while Gailieo's procedures \nwere 'unscientific' when viewed from a modem standpoint. His \nobservations fascinated me and I examined the matter further. \nChapters 8 to 1 1  are a late result of this study (I am a slow worker). \nFrank's work has been treated quite unfairly by philosophers like \nPutnam who prefer simplistic models to the analysis of complex \nhistorical events. Also his ideas are now commonplace. But it was he \nwho announced them when almost everyone thought differently. \n(5) In Vienna I became acquainted with some of the foremost \nMarxist intellectuals. This was the result of an ingenious PR job by \nMarxist students. They turned up - as did we - at all major \ndiscussions whether the subject was science, religion, politics, the \ntheatre, or free love. They talked to those of us who used science to \nridicule the rest - which was then my favourite occupation - invited \nus to discussions of their own and introduced us to Marxist thinkers \nfrom all fields. I came to know Berthold Viertel, the director of the \nBurgtheater, Hanns Eisler, the composer and music theoretician, and \nWalter Hollitscher, who became a teacher and, later on, one of my best \nfriends. When starting to discuss with Hollitscher I was a raving \npositivist, I favoured strict rules of research and had only a pitying \nsmile for the three basic principles of dialectics which I had read in \nStalin's little pamphlet on dialectical and historical materialism. I was \ninterested in the realist position, I had tried to read every book on \nrealism I could lay hands on (including Kiilpe's excellentRealisierung \nand, of course, Materialism and Empiriocriticism) but I found that the \narguments for realism worked only when the realist assumption had \n4.

Kiilpe, for example, emphasized the \ndistinction between impression and the thing the impression is about. \nThe distinction gives us realism only if it characterizes real features \nof the world - which is the point at issue. Nor was I convinced by the \nremark that science is an essentially realistic enterprise. Why should \nscience be chosen as an authority? And were there not positivistic \ninterpretations of science? The so-called 'paradoxes' of positivism, \nhowever, which Lenin exposed with such consummate skill, did not \nimpress me at all. They arose only if the positivist and the realist \nmode of speech were mixed and they exposed their difference. They \ndid not show that realism was better though the fact that realism came \nwith common sense gave the impression that it was. \nHollitscher never presented an argument that would lead, step by \nstep, from positivism into realism and he would have regarded the \nattempt to produce such an argument as philosophical folly. He \nrather developed the realist position itself, illustrated it by examples \nfrom science and common sense, showed how closely it was \nconnected with scientific research and everyday action and so \nrevealed its strength. It was of course always possible to tum a \nrealistic procedure into a positivistic procedure by a judicious use of \nad hoc hypotheses and ad hoc meaning changes and I did this \nfrequently, and without shame (in the Kraft Circle we had developed \nsuch evasions into a fine art). Hollitscher did not raise semantic \npoints, or points of method, as a critical rationalist might have done, \nhe continued to discuss concrete cases until I felt rather foolish with \nmy abstract objections. For I saw now how closely realism was \nconnected with facts, procedures, principles I valued and that it had \nhelped to bring them about while positivism merely described the results \nin a rather complicated way after they had been found: realism had \nfruits, positivism had none. This at least is how I would speak today, \nlong after my realist conversion. At the time I became a realist not \nbecause I was convinced by any particular argument, but because the \nsum total of realism plus the arguments in favour of it plus the ease \nwith which it could be applied to science and many other things I \nvaguely felt but could not lay a finger on5 finally looked better to me \n5. I remember that Reichenbach's answer to Dingler's account of relativity played \nan important part: Dingler extrapolated from what could be achieved by simple \nmechanical operations (manufacture of a Euclidean plain surface, for example) while \nReichenbach pointed out how the actual structure of the world would modify the \nresults of these operations in the large. It is of course true that Reichenbach's account \ncan be interpreted as a more efficient predictive machine and that it seemed impressive \nto me only because I did not slide into such an interpretation. Which shows to what \nextent the force of arguments depends on irrational changes of attitude. \n",

There are entities such as physical objects which obey a \n'conservation principle' in the sense that they retain their identity \nthrough a variety of manifestations and even when they are not present \nat all while other entities such as pains and after-images are \n'annihilated' with their disappearance. The conservation principles \nmay change from one developmental stage of the human organism to \nanother6 and they may be different for differentlanguages (cf. Whorfs \n'covert classifications' as described in Chapter 16). I conjectured that \nsuch principles would play an important role in science, that they might \nchange during revolutions and that deductive relations between pre­\nrevolutionary and post-revolutionary theories might be broken off as a \nresult. I explained this early version ofincommensurabili ty in Popper's \nseminar (1952) and to a small group of people in Anscombe's flat in \nOxford (also in 1952 with Geach, von Wright and L.L. Hart present) \nbut I was not able to arouse much enthusiasm on either occasion. \nWittgenstein's emphasis on the need for concrete research and his \nobjections to abstract reasoning ('Look, don't think!') somewhat \nclashed with my own tendency towards abstractness and the papers in \nwhich his influence is noticeable are therefore mixtures of concrete \nexamples and sweeping principles. 7 Wittgenstein was prepared to take \nme on as a student in Cambridge but he died before I arrived.

One was a discussion with Professor \nC.F. von Weizsacker in Hamburg (1965) on the foundations of the \nquantum theory. Von Weizsacker showed how quantum mechanics \narose from concrete research while I complained, on general \nmethodological grounds, that important alternatives had been \nomitted.

But there is a most important \ndifference. The deviations from Kepler's laws are in principle observable ('in \nprinciple' meaning 'given the known laws of nature') while the microscopic deviations \nfrom the second law of thermodynamics are not (measuring instruments are subjected \nto the same fluctuations as the things they are supposed to measure).

To explain it, let me start with some general \nobservations. The way in which social problems, problems of energy \ndistribution, ecology, education, care for the old and so on are \n'solved' in First World societies can be roughly described in the \nfollowing way. A problem arises. Nothing is done about it. People get \nconcerned. Politicians broadcast this concern. Experts are called in. \nThey develop theories and plans based on them. Power-groups with \nexperts of their own effect various modifications until a watered down \nversion is accepted and realized. The role of experts in this process \nhas gradually increased. We have now a situation where social and \npsychological theories of human thought and action have taken the \nplace of this thought and action itself. Instead of asking the people \ninvolved in a problematic situation, developers, educators, tech­\nnologists and sociologists get their information about 'what these \npeople really want and need' from theoretical studies carried out by \ntheir esteemed colleagues in what they think are the relevant fields. \nNot live human beings, but abstract models are consulted; not the \ntarget population decides, but the producers of the models. \nIntellectuals all over the world take it for granted that their models \nwill be more intelligent, make better suggestions, have a better grasp \nof the reality of humans than these humans themselves.

My function was to carry out the \neducational policies of the State of California which means I had to \nteach people what a small group of white intellectuals had decided \nwas knowledge.

I told the \nstudents what I had learned, I arranged the material in a way that \nseemed plausible and interesting to me - and that was all I did. Of \ncourse, I had also some 'ideas of my own' -but these ideas moved in a \nfairly narrow domain (though some of my friends said even then that I \nwas going batty). \nIn the years around 1964 Mexicans, blacks, Indians entered the \nuniversity as a result of new educational policies. There they sat, \npartly curious, partly disdainful, partly simply confused hoping to get \nan 'education'. What an opportunity for a prophet in search of a \nfollowing! What an opportunity, my rationalist friends told me, to \ncontribute to the spreading of reason and the improvement of \nmankind! What a marvellous opportunity for a new wave of \nenlightenment!

The \npraise of honour, patriotism, truth, rationality, honesty that fills our \nschools, pulpits, political meetings imperceptibly merges into inarticula­\ntion no matter how much it has been wrapped into literary language \nand no matter how hard its authors try to copy the style of the classics, \nand the authors themselves are in the end hardly distinguishable \nfrom a pack of grunting pigs. Is there a way to prevent such \ndeterioration? I thought there was. I thought that regarding al \nachievements as transitory, restricted and personal and every truth as \ncreated by our love for it and not as 'found' would prevent the \ndeterioration of once promising fairy-tales and I also thought that it \nwas necessary to develop a new philosophy or a new religion to give \nsubstance to this unsystematic conjecture. \nI now realize that these considerations were just another example of \nintellectualistic conceit and folly. It is conceited to assume that one \nhas solutions for people whose lives one does not share and whose \nproblems one does not know. It is foolish to assume that such an \nexercise in distant humanitarianism will have effects pleasing to the \npeople concerned. From the very beginning of Western Rationalism \nintellectuals have regarded themselves as teachers, the world as a \nschool and 'people' as obedient pupils. In Plato this is very clear. The \nsame phenomenon occurs among Christians, Rationalists, Fascists, \nMarxists. Marxists did not try to learn from those they wanted to \nliberate; they attacked each other about interpretations, viewpoints, \nevidence and took it for granted that the resulting intellectual hash \nwould make fine food for the natives (Bakunin was aware of the \ndoctrinarian tendencies of contemporary Marxism and he intended \nto return all power - power over ideas included - to the people \nimmediately concerned). My own view differed from those just \nmentioned but it was still a view, an abstract fancy I had invented and \nnow tried to sell without having shared even an ounce of the lives of \n",

I could follow my own advice to address and \ntry to influence only those people whom I think I understand on a \npersonal basis. This includes some of my friends; it may include \nphilosophers I have not met but who seem to be interested in similar \nproblems and who are not too upset by my style and my general \napproach. It may also include people from different cultures who are \nattracted, even \nfascinated by Western science and Western \nintellectual life, who have started participating in it but who still \nremember, in thought as well as in feeling the life of the culture they \nleft behind. My account might lessen the emotional tension they are \nliable to feel and make them see a way of uniting, rather than \nopposing to each other, the various stages of their lives. \nAnother possibility is a change of subject. I started my career as a \nstudent of acting, theatre production and singing at the Institute for \nthe Methodological Reformation of the German Theatre in the \nGerman Democratic Republic. This appealed to my intellectualism \nand my dramatic propensities. My intellectualism told me that \nproblems had to be solved by thought. My dramatic propensities \nmade me think that hamming it up was better than going through an \nabstract argument. There is of course no conflict here for argument \nwithout illustration leads away from the human elements which affect \nthe most abstract problems. The arts, as I see them today, are not a \ndomain separated from abstract thought, but complementary to it \nand needed to fully realize its potential. Examining this function of \nthe arts and trying to establish a mode of research that unites their \npower with that of science and religion seems to be a fascinating \nenterprise and one to which I might devote a year (or two, or \nthree . . .  ). \n",

And so on. This sounds like Protagoras, and I say so, in \nthesis iii. However, I then describe (theses v and vi) how traditions \ninteract. I discuss two possibilities, a guided exchange and an open \nexchange. A guided exchange adopts 'a well-specified tradition and \naccept[ s] only those responses that correspond to its standards. If one \nparty has not yet become a participant . . . he will be badgered, \npersuaded, 'educated' until he does - and then the exchange begins.' \n'A rational debate', I continue, 'is a special case of a guided exchange.' \nIn the case of an open exchange 'the participants get immersed into \neach other's ways of thinking, feeling, perceiving to such an extent \nthat their ideas, perceptions, world-views may be entirely changed ­\nthey become different people participating in a new and different \ntradition. An open exchange respects the partner whether he is an \nindividual or an entire culture, while a rational exchange promises \nrespect only within the framework of a rational debate. An open \nexchange has no organon though it may invent one; there is no \nlogic though new forms of logic may emerge in its course.' In sum, \nan open exchange is part of an as yet unspecified and unspecifiable \npractice. \nThese comments imply, first, that traditions are rarely well defined \n(open exchanges are going on all the time) and, secondly, that their \ninteractions cannot be understood in general terms. Keeping \ntraditions alive in the face of external influences we act in an only \npartly conscious way. We can describe results after they have \noccurred, we cannot incorporate them into a lasting theoretical \nstructure (such as relativism). In other words, there cannot be any \ntheory of knowledge (except as part of a special and fairly stable \ntradition), there can at most be a (rather incomplete) history of the \nways in which knowledge has changed in the past. In my next book I \nshall discuss some episodes of such a history. \nIn the meantime I have started using the term 'relativism' again, \nbut in a new sense. In the second edition of the present book I \nexplained this sense by saying that 'Scientists [and, for that matter, all \nmembers of relatively uniform cultures] are sculptors of reality.'7 \nThat sounds like the strong programme of the sociology of science \nexcept that sculptors are restricted by the properties of the material \nthey use.

Even an 'objective' enterprise like science which \napparently reveals Nature As She Is In Herself intervenes, \neliminates, enlarges, produces and codifies the results in a severely \nstandardized way - but again there is no guarantee that the results \nwill congeal into a unified world. Thus all we apprehend when \nexperimenting, or interfering in less systematic ways, or simply living \nas part of a well-developed culture is how what surrounds us responds \nto our actions (thoughts, observations, etc.); we do not apprehend these \nsurroundings themselves: Culture and Nature (or Being, to use \na more general term) are always entangled in a fashion that can be \nexplored only by entering into further and even more complicated \nentanglements. \nNow, considering that scientists use different and often contradic­\ntory methods of research (I describe some of them in Chapter 19 of \nthe present edition), that most of these methods are successful and \nthat numerous non-scientific ways of life not only survived but \nprotected and enriched their inhabitants we have to conclude that \nBeing responds differently, and positively, to many different \napproaches. Being is like a person who shows a friendly face to a \nfriendly visitor, becomes angry at an angry gesture, remains unmoved \nby a bore without giving any hint as to the principles that make Him \n(Her? It? Them?) act the way they do in the different circumstances. \nWhat we find when living, experimenting, doing research is therefore \nnot a single scenario called 'the world' or 'being' or 'reality' but a \nvariety of responses, each of them constituting a special (and not \nalways well-defined) reality for those who have called it forth. This is \nrelativism because the type of reality encountered depends on the \napproach taken. However, it differs from the philosophical doctrine \nby admitting failure: not every approach succeeds. In my reply to \ncritics8 I called this form of relativism 'cosmological' relativism, in \nan article published in lride9 I spoke of an 'ontological' relativism, in \n'Nature as a Work of Art' 10 I argued that the world of modern \nscience (and not only the description of this world) is an artwork \nconstructed by generations of artisan/scientists while in 'Realism \nand the Historicity of Knowledge'1 1  I indicated how such views are \nrelated to the ideas of Niels Bohr.

I also agree that it is not enough to undermine the \nauthority of the sciences by historical arguments: why should the \nauthority of history be greater than that of, say, physics? Al we can \nshow historically is that a general appeal to scientific authority runs \ninto contradictions. That undermines any such appeal; however, it \ndoes not tell us how science should now be interpreted or used. \n(Such questions, I would say, have to be answered by the interested \nparties themselves, according to their standards, conceptions, \ncultural commitments.) \nKuhn says that 'the difficulties that have seemed to undermine the \nauthority of science should not be simply seen as observed facts about \nits practice. Rather they are necessary characteristics of any \ndevelopmental or evolutionary process.' But how do we know that \nscience is an evolutionary process rather than a static way of finding \nmore facts and better laws? Either from 'observed facts about its \npractice' or from interpretations that are imposed from the outside. \nIn the first case we are back at the situation Kuhn wants to overcome \nwhile the second case means that science is being incorporated into a \nwider (cultural) context - a context that values developments - and is \ninterpreted accordingly (the procedure I mentioned in parentheses \nabove). It seems that is what Kuhn really wants, i.e. he wants to settle \nthe question philosophically, not by appealing to facts. I would agree \nif I knew that for him this is one way among many and not the only \npossible procedure. \nSummarizing his argument Kuhn makes three assertions. 'First, \nthe Archimedian platform, outside history, outside of time and space, \nis gone beyond recall.' Yes, and no. It is gone as a structure that can \nbe described and yet shown to be independent of any description. It is \nnot gone as an unknown background of our existence which affects \nus but in a way which forever hides its essence. Nor is \nArchimedianism gone as a possible approach. It would be the \npolitically correct approach in a theocracy, for example. \nSecondly, Kuhn says that in the absence of an Archimedian \nplatform 'comparative evaluation is all there is'. That is of course true \n- and trivially so. Thirdly, he challenges the traditional notion of truth \n",

My point is, rather, \nthat no sense can be made of the notion of a reality as it has ordinarily \nfunctioned in the philosophy of science.' Here I agree with the \nproviso that more metaphysical notions of reality (such as those \nproposed by Pseudo Dionysius Areopagita) have not yet been \ndisposed of. \nLet me repeat that the cultures that call forth a certain reality and \nthese realities themselves are never well defined. Cultures change, \nthey interact with other cultures and the indefiniteness resulting \ntherefrom is reflected in their worlds. This is what makes \nintercultural understanding and scientific change possible: poten­\ntially every culture is all cultures.

Now rich with its own competing ideas, this field is \nprominent among management researchers. It has also become a \nthriving area of inquiry among economists. The extent and vitality \nof the body of literature that traces in some way from the book, \nwhether pro or con, is enormously gratifying. The number of out-\nstanding scholars who are working in this field—some of whom I \nhave had the privilege of teaching, mentoring, and writing with— \nhas fulfilled my central aspiration of influencing the path of knowl-\nedge. \nThe re-issue of Competitive Strategy has led me to ponder the \nreasons for the book's impact. They are clearer to me now with the \npassage of time. Competition has always been central to the agenda \nof companies, but it certainly did not hurt that the book came at a \ntime when companies all over the world were struggling to cope \nwith growing competition. Indeed, competition has become one of \nthe enduring themes of our time. The rising intensity of competition \nhas continued until this day, and spread to more and more countries. \nTranslations of the book in mainland China (1997) or into Czech, \nSlovak, Hungarian, Polish, or Ukrainian would have been unthink-\nable in 1980. \nThe book filled a void in management thinking. After several \ndecades of development, the role of general managers versus spe-\ncialists was becoming better defined. Strategic planning had become \nwidely accepted as the important task of charting a long-term direc-\ntion for an enterprise. Early thinkers in the field such as Kenneth An-\ndrews and C Roland Christensen had raised some important \nquestions in developing a strategy, as I note in Competitive Strat-\negy's, original introduction. Yet there were no systematic, rigorous \ntools for answering these questions—assessing a company's indus-\ntry, understanding competitors, and choosing a competitive position. \nSome newly founded strategy consulting firms had moved to fill this \nvoid, but the ideas they put forward, such as the experience curve, \nrested on a single presumed basis of competition and a single type of \nstrategy. \nCompetitive Strategy offered a rich framework for understand-\ning the underlying forces of competition in industries, captured in \nthe \"five forces.\" The framework reveals the important differences \n",

Competitive Strategy provided tools for capturing \nthe richness and heterogeneity of industries and companies while \nproviding a disciplined structure for examining them. The book also \nbrought structure to the concept of competitive advantage through \ndefining it in terms of cost and differentiation, and linking it directly \nto profitability. Managers looking for concrete ways to tackle strate-\ngic planning's difficult questions quickly embraced the book, which \nrang true to practitioners. \nThe book also signaled a new direction and provided an impetus \nfor economic thinking. The economic theory of competition at the \ntime was highly stylized. Economists focused mainly on industries; \ncompanies were presumed equal or differing primarily in size or in \nunexplained differences in efficiency. The prevailing view of indus-\ntry structure encompassed seller concentration and a few sources of \nbarriers to entry. Managers were all but absent in economic models, \nwith virtually no latitude to affect competitive outcomes. Econo-\nmists were concerned mainly with the societal and public policy \nconsequences of alternative industry structures and patterns of com-\npetition. The aim was to push \"excess\" profits down. Few econo-\nmists had ever even considered the question of what the nature of \ncompetition implied for company behavior, or how to push profits \nup. Moreover, economists also lacked the tools to model competi-\ntion among small numbers of firms whose behavior affected each \nother. Competitive Strategy identified a range of phenomena that \neconomists, armed with new game-theoretic techniques, have begun \nto explore mathematically for the first time. \nMy training and assignments—first an MBA, then an econ-\nomics PhD, then the unique Harvard Business School challenge of \nusing the case method to teach practitioners—revealed the gap be-\ntween actual competition and the stylized models. They also created \na sense of urgency to develop tools that would inform actual choices \nin real markets. With rich industry and company knowledge from \nmany case studies, I was able to offer a more sophisticated view of \nindustry competition and bring some structure to the question of \nhow a firm could outperform its rivals. Industry structure involved \nfive forces, not two. Competitive positions could be thought of in \nterms of cost, differentiation, and scope. In my theory, managers had \nimportant latitude to influence industry structure and to position the \ncompany relative to others. \nMarket signaling, switching costs, barriers to exit, cost versus \n",

My approach \nhelped open up new territory for economists to explore, and offered \neconomists in business schools a way of moving beyond the teach-\ning of standard economic concepts and models. Competitive Strat-\negy has not only been widely used in teaching but has motivated and \nserved as a starting point in other efforts to bring economic thinking \nto bear on practice.1 \nWhat has changed since the book was published? In some ways, \neverything has changed. New technologies, new management tools, \nnew growth industries, and new government policies have appeared \nand reappeared. But in another sense, nothing has changed. The \nbook provides an underlying framework for examining competition \nthat transcends industries, particular technologies, or management \napproaches. It applies to high-tech, low-tech, and service industries. \nThe advent of the Internet can alter barriers to entry, reshape buyer \npower, or drive new patterns of substitution, for example, yet the un-\nderlying forces of industry competition stay the same. Industry \nchanges make the ideas in the book even more important, because of \nthe need to rethink industry structure and boundaries. While 1990s \ncompanies may look very different than 1980s companies or 1970s \ncompanies, superior profitability within an industry still rests on rel-\native cost and differentiation. One may believe that faster cycle time \nor total quality hold the key to competing, but the acid test comes in \nhow these practices affect industry rivalry, a company's relative cost \nposition, or its ability to differentiate itself and command a price \npremium. \nThe ideas in the book have endured for the very reason that they \naddressed the underlying fundamentals of competition in a way that \nis independent of the specifics of the ways companies go about com-\npeting. A number of other books on competition have come and \ngone because they were really about special cases, or were grounded \nnot in the principles of competitive strategy but in particular com-\npetitive practices. That is not to say that Competitive Strategy is the \nlast word on the subject. Quite the contrary, and there is much im-\n1 Notable examples include S.

This is a challenging question \nfor any author to answer objectively. Competitive Strategy could \nclearly be enriched in the form of new examples, in both old and \nnew industries. The concepts are just as powerful in services as in \nproducts, and more service examples could be added. The frame-\nworks have been applied in virtually all significant countries, and an \ninternationalization of the examples would be very much in order. \nWhile the industries, companies, and countries change, however, the \npower of the concepts is enduring. \nOn the level of ideas, I can honestly say that there is nothing yet \nthat I am persuaded to retract. This does not mean that we have not \npushed learning further. Various parts of the framework have been \ntested, challenged, deepened, and importantly extended by others, \nmostly academics. It is a source of pride, and some discomfort, that \nCompetitive Strategy has so often been a foil for other authors. It is \nimpossible here to do justice to this literature, which offers much \nnew insight. The supplier side has been fleshed out, for example, as \nhas our understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of barriers to \nentry. Also, while firms inevitably have a bargaining relationship \nwith suppliers and buyers, firms can enhance total value to be di-\nvided by working cooperatively with buyers, suppliers, and producers \nof complementary products. This was developed in my later book \nCompetitive Advantage, and in subsequent literature.2 Finally, em-\npirical work has verified many of Competitive Strategy's propositions. \nCompetitive Strategy has certainly stirred its share of contro-\nversy. Some of it involves misunderstandings, and suggests areas \nwhere the presentation could be clearer. For example, some have \ncriticized the book for implying a static framework in a world that is \nrapidly changing. Nothing static was ever intended. Each part of the \nframework—industry analysis, competitor analysis, competitive po-\nsitioning—stresses conditions that are subject to change. Indeed, the \nframeworks reveal the dimensions of change that will be the most \nsignificant. Much of the book is about how to understand and deal \n2 The most important single contribution is A.

My position is that being the \nlowest cost producer and being truly differentiated and commanding \na price premium are rarely compatible. Successful strategies require \nchoice or they can be easily imitated. Becoming \"stuck in the mid-\ndle\"—the phrase I introduced—is a recipe for disaster. Sometimes \ncompanies such as Microsoft get so far ahead that they seem to \navoid the need for strategic choices, but this becomes their ultimate \nvulnerability. \nThis never meant companies could ignore cost in the pursuit of \ndifferentiation, or ignore differentiation in the pursuit of lowest cost. \nNor should companies forgo improvements in one dimension that in-\nvolve no sacrifice in the other. Finally, a lowest-cost or differentiated \nposition, whether broad or focused, involves constant improvement. \nA strategic position is a path, not a fixed location. I have recently in-\ntroduced the distinction between operational effectiveness and \nstrategic position that helps to clarify some of this confusion.3 \nOther controversies raised by the book, however, reflect real dif-\nferences of opinion. A school of thought has emerged which argues \nthat industries are not important to strategy, because industry struc-\nture and boundaries are said to change so rapidly or because prof-\nitability is seen as dominated by individual firm position. I have \nalways argued that both industry and position are important, and that \nignoring either one exposes a firm to peril. Industry differences in \naverage profitability are large and enduring. Recent statistical evi-\ndence confirms the importance of industry in explaining both firm \nprofitability and stock market performance, and finds that industry \ndifferences are remarkably stable even in the 1990s.4 It also suggests \nthat industry attributes are important in explaining the dispersion of \n3 M. E.

It highlights the fact that \ncompetition is more than just rivalry with existing competitors. \nWhile there can be ambiguity about where to draw industry bound-\naries, one of the five forces always captures the essential issues in \nthe division of value. Some have argued for the addition of a sixth \nforce, most often government or technology. I remain convinced that \nthe roles of government or technology cannot be understood in iso-\nlation, but through the five forces. \nAnother school of thought asserts that factor market (input) con-\nditions take primacy over industry competition in determining com-\npany performance. Again, there is no empirical evidence to weigh \nagainst the considerable evidence about the role of industry, and \nsupplier conditions are part of industry structure. While resources, \ncapabilities, or other attributes related to input markets have a place \nin understanding the dynamics of competition, attempting to dis-\nconnect them from industry competition and the unique positions \nthat firms occupy vis-à-vis rivals is fraught with danger. The value \nof resources and capabilities is inextricably bound with strategy. \nNo matter how much we learn about what goes on inside firms, \nthen, understanding industries and competitors will continue to be \nessential to guide what firms should aim to do. \nFinally, in recent years there have been some who argue that \nfirms should not choose competitive positions at all but concentrate \non, variously, staying flexible, incorporating new ideas, or building \nup critical resources or core competencies that are portrayed as in-\ndependent of competitive position. \nI respectfully disagree.

Those techniques that have been \nadvanced for answering the questions, often by consulting firms, \neither address the diversified company rather than the industry per-\nspective or consider only one aspect of industry structure, like the \nbehavior of costs, that cannot hope to capture the richness and com-\nplexity of industry competition. \nThis book presents a comprehensive framework of analytical \ntechniques to help a firm analyze its industry as a whole and predict \nthe industry's future evolution, to understand its competitors and its \nown position, and to translate this analysis into a competitive strate-\ngy for a particular business. The book is organized into three parts. \nPart I presents a general framework for analyzing the structure of an \nindustry and its competitors. The underpinning of this framework is \nthe analysis of the five competitive forces acting on an industry and \ntheir strategic implications. Part I builds on this framework to pre-\nsent techniques for the analysis of competitors, buyers, and sup-\npliers; techniques for reading market signals; game theoretic con-\ncepts for making and responding to competitive moves; an approach \nto mapping strategic groups in an industry and explaining differ-\nences in their performance; and a framework for predicting industry \nevolution. \nPart II shows how the analytical framework described in Part I \ncan be used to develop competitive strategy in particular important \ntypes of industry environments. These differing environments reflect \nfundamental differences in industry concentration, state of maturi-\nty, and exposure to international competition. These differing envi-\nronments are crucial in determining the strategic context in which a \nbusiness competes, the strategic alternatives available, and the com-\nmon strategic errors. Part II examines fragmented industries, emerg-\ning industries, the transition to industry maturity, declining indus-\ntries, and global industries. \nPart III of the book completes the analytical framework by \nsystematically examining the important types of strategic decisions \nthat confront firms in competing in a single industry: vertical inte-\ngration, major capacity expansion, and entry into new businesses. \n(Divestment is considered in detail in Chapter 12 in Part II.)

Part III is designed not only to help a company make \nthese key decisions but also to give it insight into how its competi-\ntors, customers, suppliers, and potential entrants might make them. \nTo analyze competitive strategy for a particular business, the \nreader can draw on the book in a number of ways. First, the general \nanalytical tools of Part I can be utilized. Second, the chapter or \nchapters from Part II that bear on the key dimensions of the firm's \nindustry can be used to provide some more specific guidance for \nstrategy formulation in the business's particular environment.

Even if a particular deci-\nsion is not imminent, Part III will usually be helpful in reviewing de-\ncisions that have already been made and in examining the past and \npresent decisions of competitors. \nWhereas the reader can dip into a particular chapter, a great \ndeal is gained by having a working understanding of the entire \nframework as a starting point for attacking a particular strategic \nproblem. The parts of the book are meant to enrich and reinforce \neach other. Sections seemingly not important to the firm's own posi-\ntion may well be crucial in looking at competitors, and the broad in-\ndustry circumstances or the strategic decision currently on the table \nmay change. Reading the full book may appear formidable, but the \neffort will be rewarded in terms of the speed and clarity with which a \nstrategic situation can then be assessed and a competitive strategy \ndeveloped. \nIt will soon be apparent from reading the book that a compre-\nhensive analysis of an industry and its competitors requires a great \ndeal of data, some of it subtle and difficult to obtain.

Different firms have differ-\nent words for some of the concepts illustrated. For example, some \nfirms use terms like \"mission\" or \"objective\" instead of \"goals,\" \nand some firms use \"tactics\" instead of \"operating\" or \"functional \npolicies.\" Yet the essential notion of strategy is captured in the dis-\ntinction between ends and means. \nFigure 1-1, which can be called the \"Wheel of Competitive \nStrategy,\" is a device for articulating the key aspects of a firm's \ncompetitive strategy on a single page.

Industry structure has a strong influence in determining \nthe competitive rules of the game as well as the strategies potentially \navailable to the firm. Forces outside the industry are significant pri-\nmarily in a relative sense; since outside forces usually affect all firms \nin the industry, the key is found in the differing abilities of firms to \ndeal with them. \nThe intensity of competition in an industry is neither a matter \nof coincidence nor bad luck. Rather, competition in an industry is \nrooted in its underlying economic structure and goes well beyond the \nbehavior of current competitors. The state of competition in an in-\ndustry depends on five basic competitive forces, which are shown in \nFigure 1-1. The collective strength of these forces determines the ul-\ntimate profit potential in the industry, where profit potential is mea-\nsured in terms of long run return on invested capital.

Structural analysis is the fun-\ndamental underpinning for formulating competitive strategy and a \nkey building block for most of the concepts in this book. \nTo avoid needless repetition, the term \"product\" rather than \n\"product or service\" will be used to refer to the output of an in-\ndustry, even though the principles of structural analysis developed \nhere apply equally to product and service businesses. Structural \nanalysis also applies to diagnosing industry competition in any coun-\ntry or in an international market, though some of the institutional \ncircumstances may differ.1 \nStructural Determinants of the Intensity \nof Competition \nLet us adopt the working definition of an industry as the group \nof firms producing products that are close substitutes for each other. \nIn practice there is often a great deal of controversy over the appro-\npriate definition, centering around how close substitutability needs \nto be in terms of product, process, or geographic market boundaries. \nBecause we will be in a better position to treat these issues once the \nbasic concept of structural analysis has been introduced, we will as-\nsume initially that industry boundaries have already been drawn. \nCompetition in an industry continually works to drive down the \nrate of return on invested capital toward the competitive floor rate \nof return, or the return that would be earned by the economist's \n\"perfectly competitive\" industry. This competitive floor, or \"free \nmarket\" return, is approximated by the yield on long-term govern-\nment securities adjusted upward by the risk of capital loss. Investors \nwill not tolerate returns below this rate in the long run because of \ntheir alternative of investing in other industries, and firms habitually \nearning less than this return will eventually go out of business. The \npresence of rates of return higher than the adjusted free market re-\nturn serves to stimulate the inflow of capital into an industry either \nthrough new entry or through additional investment by existing com-\npetitors.

Customers, sup-\npliers, substitutes, and potential entrants are all \"competitors\" to \nfirms in the industry and may be more or less prominent depending \non the particular circumstances. Competition in this broader sense \nmight be termed extended rivalry. \nAll five competitive forces jointly determine the intensity of in-\ndustry competition and profitability, and the strongest force or \nforces are governing and become crucial from the point of view of \nstrategy formulation. For example, even a company with a very \nstrong market position in an industry where potential entrants are no \nthreat will earn low returns if it faces a superior, lower-cost substi-\ntute. Even with no substitutes and blocked entry, intense rivalry \namong existing competitors will limit potential returns. The extreme \ncase of competitive intensity is the economist's perfectly competitive \nindustry, where entry is free, existing firms have no bargaining \npower against suppliers and customers, and rivalry is unbridled be-\ncause the numerous firms and products are all alike. \nDifferent forces take on prominence, of course, in shaping com-\npetition in each industry. In the ocean-going tanker industry the key \nforce is probably the buyers (the major oil companies), whereas in \ntires it is powerful original equipment (OEM) buyers coupled with \ntough competitors. In the steel industry the key forces are foreign \ncompetitors and substitute materials. \nThe underlying structure of an industry, reflected in the \nstrength of the forces, should be distinguished from the many short-\nrun factors that can affect competition and profitability in a tran-\nsient way. For example, fluctuations in economic conditions over the \nbusiness cycle influence the short-run profitability of nearly all firms \nin many industries, as can material shortages, strikes, spurts in de-\nmand, and the like. Although such factors may have tactical signifi-\ncance, the focus of the analysis of industry structure, or \"structural \nanalysis,\" is on identifying the basic, underlying characteristics of \nan industry rooted in its economics and technology that shape the \narena in which competitive strategy must be set.

Yet \nunderstanding industry structure must be the starting point for \nstrategic analysis. \nA number of important economic and technical characteristics \nof an industry are critical to the strength of each competitive force. \nThese will be discussed in turn. \nTHREAT OF ENTRY \nNew entrants to an industry bring new capacity, the desire to \ngain market share, and often substantial resources. Prices can be bid \ndown or incumbents' costs inflated as a result, reducing profitabili-\nty. Companies diversifying through acquisition into the industry \nfrom other markets often use their resources to cause a shake-up, as \nPhilip Morris did with Miller beer. Thus acquisition into an industry \nwith intent to build market position should probably be viewed as \nentry even though no entirely new entity is created. \nThe threat of entry into an industry depends on the barriers to \nentry that are present, coupled with the reaction from existing com-\npetitors that the entrant can expect. If barriers are high and/or the \nnewcomer can expect sharp retaliation from entrenched competitors, \nthe threat of entry is low. \nBARRIERS TO ENTRY \nThere are six major sources of barriers to entry: \nEconomies of Scale. Economies of scale refer to declines in \nunit costs of a product (or operation or function that goes into pro-\nducing a product) as the absolute volume per period increases. Econ-\nomies of scale deter entry by forcing the entrant to come in at large \nscale and risk strong reaction from existing firms or come in at a \nsmall scale and accept a cost disadvantage, both undesirable op-\ntions. Scale economies can be present in nearly every function of a \nbusiness, including manufacturing, purchasing, research and devel-\nopment, marketing, service network, sales force utilization, and dis-\ntribution. For example, scale economies in production, research, \nmarketing, and service are probably the key barriers to entry in the \nmainframe computer industry, as Xerox and General Electric sadly \ndiscovered. \n",

    "chunk_full": "8 \nCOMPETITIVE STRATEGY \nScale economies may relate to an entire functional area, as in \nthe case of a sales force, or they may stem from particular opera-\ntions or activities that are part of a functional area. For example, in \nthe manufacture of television sets, economies of scale are large in \ncolor tube production, and they are less significant in cabinetmaking \nand set assembly. It is important to examine each component of \ncosts separately for its particular relationship between unit cost and \nscale. \nUnits of multibusiness firms may be able to reap economies \nsimilar to those of scale if they are able to share operations or func-\ntions subject to economies of scale with other businesses in the com-\npany. For example, the multibusiness company may manufacture \nsmall electric motors, which are then used in producing industrial \nfans, hairdryers, and cooling systems for electronic equipment. If \neconomies of scale in motor manufacturing extend beyond the num-\nber of motors needed in any one market, the multibusiness firm di-\nversified in this way will reap economies in motor manufacturing \nthat exceed those available if it only manufactured motors for use in, \nsay, hairdryers. Thus related diversification around common opera-\ntions or functions can remove volume constraints imposed by the \nsize of a given industry.2 The prospective entrant is forced to be di-\nversified or face a cost disadvantage. Potentially shareable activities \nor functions subject to economies of scale can include sales forces, \ndistribution systems, purchasing, and so on. \nThe benefits of sharing are particularly potent if there are joint \ncosts. Joint costs occur when a firm producing product A (or an \noperation or function that is part of producing A) must inherently \nhave the capacity to produce product B. An example is air passenger \nservices and air cargo, where because of technological constraints \nonly so much space in the aircraft can be filled with passengers, leav-\ning available cargo space and payload capacity. Many of the costs \nmust be borne to put the plane into the air and there is capacity for \nfreight regardless of the quantity of passengers the plane is carrying. \nThus the firm that competes in both passenger and freight may have \na substantial advantage over the firm competing in only one market. \n2For this entry barrier to- be significant it is crucial that the shared operation or \nfunction be subject to economies of scale which extend beyond the size of any one \nmarket. If this is not the case, cost savings of sharing can be illusory. A company \nmay see its costs decline as overhead is spread, but this depends solely on the \npresence of excess capacity in the operation or function. These economies are \nshort-run economies, and once capacity is fully utilized and expanded the true cost \nof the shared operation will become apparent. \n",

The entrant who cannot cap-\nture the highest available incremental revenue from the by-products \ncan face a disadvantage if incumbent firms do. \nA common situation of joint costs occurs when business units \ncan share intangible assets such as brand names and know-how. The \ncost of creating an intangible asset need only be borne once; the asset \nmay then be freely applied to other business, subject only to any costs \nof adapting or modifying it. Thus situations in which intangible as-\nsets are shared can lead to substantial economies. \nA type of economies of scale entry barrier occurs when there are \neconomies to vertical integration, that is, operating in successive \nstages of production or distribution. Here the entrant must enter in-\ntegrated or face a cost disadvantage, as well as possible foreclosure \nof inputs or markets for its product if most established competitors \nare integrated. Foreclosure in such situations stems from the fact \nthat most customers purchase from in-house units, or most suppliers \n\"sell\" their inputs in-house. The independent firm faces a difficult \ntime in getting comparable prices and may become \"squeezed\" if in-\ntegrated competitors offer different terms to it than to their captive \nunits. The requirement to enter integrated may heighten the risks of \nretaliation and also elevate other entry barriers discussed below. \nProduct Differentiation. Product differentiation means that \nestablished firms have brand identification and customer loyalties, \nwhich stem from past advertising, customer service, product differ-\nences, or simply being first into the industry. Differentiation creates \na barrier to entry by forcing entrants to spend heavily to overcome \nexisting customer loyalties. This effort usually involves start-up \nlosses and often takes an extended period of time. Such investments \nin building a brand name are particularly risky since they have no \nsalvage value if entry fails. \nProduct differentiation is perhaps the most important entry \nbarrier in baby care products, over-the-counter drugs, cosmetics, in-\nvestment banking, and public accounting. In the brewing industry, \nproduct differentiation is coupled with economies of scale in produc-\ntion, marketing, and distribution to create high barriers. \nCapital Requirements.

Switching costs may \ninclude employee retraining costs, cost of new ancillary equipment, \ncost and time in testing or qualifying a new source, need for techni-\ncal help as a result of reliance on seller engineering aid, product rede-\nsign, or even psychic costs of severing a relationship.\" If these \nswitching costs are high, then new entrants must offer a major im-\nprovement in cost or performance in order for the buyer to switch \nfrom an incumbent. For example, in intravenous (IV) solutions and \nkits for use in hospitals, procedures for attaching solutions to pa-\ntients differ among competitive products and the hardware for hang-\ning the IV bottles are not compatible. Here switching encounters \ngreat resistance from nurses responsible for administering the treat-\nment and requires new investments in hardware. \nAccess to Distribution Channels. A barrier to entry can be \ncreated by the new entrant's need to secure distribution for its prod-\nuct. To the extent that logical distribution channels for the product \nhave already been served by established firms, the new firm must \npersuade the channels to accept its product through price breaks, \ncooperative advertising allowances, and the like, which reduce prof-\nits. The manufacturer of a new food product, for example, must per-\n]In some industries suppliers are willing to help finance entry in order to increase \ntheir own sales (oil tankers, logging equipment). This obviously lowers effective \ncapital barriers to entry. \n'Switching costs may also be present for the seller. Switching costs and some of \ntheir implications will be discussed more fully in Chapter 6. \n",

Existing competitors may \nhave ties with channels based on long relationships, high-quality \nservice, or even exclusive relationships in which the channel is solely \nidentified with a particular manufacturer. Sometimes this barrier to \nentry is so high that to surmount it a new firm must create an entirely \nnew distribution channel, as Timex did in the watch industry. \nCost Disadvantages Independent of Scale. Established firms \nmay have cost advantages not replicable by potential entrants no \nmatter what their size and attained economies of scale. The most \ncritical advantages are factors such as the following: \n• Proprietary product technology: product know-how or de-\nsign characteristics that are kept proprietary through patents \nor secrecy. \n• Favorable access to raw materials: established firms may \nhave locked up the most favorable sources and/or tied up \nforeseeable needs early at prices reflecting a lower demand \nfor them than currently exists.

Discoverers of sulphur \ndeposits were often disappointed oil companies who were ex-\nploring for oil and not prone to value them highly. \n• Favorable locations: established firms may have cornered \nfavorable locations before market forces bid up prices to cap-\nture their full value. \n• Government subsidies: preferential government subsidies \nmay give established firms lasting advantages in some bus-\ninesses. \n• Learning or experience curve: in some businesses, there is an \nobserved tendency for unit costs to decline as the firm gains \nmore cumulative experience in producing a product.

If existing \ncompetitors are expected to respond forcefully to make the entrant's \nstay in the industry an unpleasant one, then entry may well be de-\nterred. Conditions that signal the strong likelihood of retaliation to \nentry and hence deter it are the following: \n• a history of vigorous retaliation to entrants; \n• established firms with substantial resources to fight back, in-\ncluding excess cash and unused borrowing capacity, adequate \nexcess productive capacity to meet all likely future needs, or \ngreat leverage with distribution channels or customers; \n• established firms with great commitment to the industry and \nhighly illiquid assets employed in it; \n• slow industry growth, which limits the ability of the industry \nto absorb a new firm without depressing the sales and finan-\ncial performance of established firms. \nTHE ENTRY DETERRING PRICE \nThe condition of entry in an industry can be summarized in an \nimportant hypothetical concept called the entry deterring price: the \nprevailing structure of prices (and related terms such as product qual-\nity and service) which just balances the potential rewards from entry \n(forecast by the potential entrant) with the expected costs of over-\ncoming structural entry barriers and risking retaliation. If the cur-\nrent price level is higher than the entry deterring price, entrants will \nforecast above-average profits from entry, and entry will occur. Of \ncourse the entry deterring price depends on entrants' expectations of \nthe future and not just current conditions. \nThe threat of entry into an industry can be eliminated if incum-\nbent firms choose or are forced by competition to price below this \nhypothetical entry deterring price. If they price above it, gains in \nterms of profitability may be short-lived because they will be dis-\nsipated by the cost of fighting or coexisting with new entrants. \nPROPERTIES OF ENTRY BARRIERS \nThere are several additional properties of entry barriers that are \ncrucial from a strategic standpoint.

It is not surprising that Kodak plunged into the \nmarket. Product differentiation in the magazine printing industry \nhas all but disappeared, reducing barriers. Conversely, in the auto \nindustry, economies of scale increased with post-World War II auto-\nmation and vertical integration, virtually stopping successful new \nentry. \nSecond, although entry barriers sometimes change for reasons \nlargely outside the firm's control, the firm's strategic decisions also \ncan have a major impact. For example, the actions of many U. S. \nwine producers in the 1960s to step up introductions of new prod-\nucts, raise advertising levels, and undertake national distribution \nsurely increased entry barriers by raising economies of scale in the \nindustry and making access to distribution channels more difficult. \nSimilarly, decisions by members of the recreational vehicle industry \nto vertically integrate into parts manufacture in order to lower costs \nhave greatly increased the economies of scale there and raised the \ncapital cost barriers. \nFinally, some firms may possess resources or skills which allow \nthem to overcome entry barrier into an industry more cheaply than \nmost other firms. For example, Gillette, with well-developed distri-\nbution channels for razors and blades, faced lower costs of entry in-\nto disposable lighters than did many other firms. The ability to share \ncosts also provides opportunities for low-cost entry. (In Chapter 16 \nwe will explore the implications of factors like these for entry strat-\negy in some detail). \nEXPERIENCE AND SCALE AS ENTRY BARRIERS \nAlthough they often coincide, economies of scale and experi-\nence have very different properties as entry barriers. The presence of \neconomies of scale always leads to a cost advantage for the large-\nscale firm (or firm that can share activities) over small-scale firms, \npresupposing that the former have the most efficient facilities, distri-\nbution systems, service organizations, or other functional activities \nfor their size.5 This cost advantage can be matched only by attaining \ncomparable scale or appropriate diversification to allow cost shar-\ning. The large-scale or diversified firm can spread the fixed costs \nof operating these efficient facilities over a large number of units, \n'And presupposing that the large-scale firm does not nullify its advantage through \nproduct line proliferation. \n",

Another crucial prerequisite is that the experience be propri-\netary, and not available to competitors and potential entrants \nthrough (1) copying, (2) hiring a competitor's employees, or (3) pur-\nchasing the latest machinery from equipment suppliers or purchas-\ning know-how from consultants or other firms. Frequently, expe-\nrience cannot be kept proprietary; even when it can, experience may \naccumulate more rapidly for the second and third firms in the mar-\nket than it did for the pioneer because followers can observe some \naspects of the pioneer's operations. Where experience cannot be kept \nproprietary, new entrants may actually have an advantage if they \ncan buy the latest equipment or adapt to new methods unencum-\nbered by having operated the old way in the past. \nOther limits to the experience curve as an entry barrier are as \nfollows: \n• The barrier can be nullified by product or process innovations \nleading to a substantially new technology and thereby creat-\ning an entirely new experience curve.6 New entrants can leap-\nfrog the industry leaders and alight on the new experience \ncurve, to which the leaders may be poorly positioned to jump. \n6For an example of this development drawn from the history of the automobile \nindustry, see Abernathy and Wayne (1974), p. 109. \n",

When firms are \nnumerous, the likelihood of mavericks is great and some firms may \nhabitually believe they can make moves without being noticed. Even \nwhere there are relatively few firms, if they are relatively balanced in \nterms of size and perceived resources, it creates instability because \nthey may be prone to fight each other and have the resources for sus-\ntained and vigorous retaliation. When the industry is highly concen-\ntrated or dominated by one or a few firms, on the other hand, then \nthere is little mistaking relative strength, and the leader or leaders \ncan impose discipline as well as play a coordinative role in the indus-\ntry through devices like price leadership. \nIn many industries foreign competitors, either exporting into \nthe industry or participating directly through foreign investment, \nplay an important role in industry competition. Foreign competi-\ntors, although having some differences that will be noted later, \nshould be treated just like national competitors for purposes of \nstructural analysis. \nSlow Industry Growth. Slow industry growth turns competi-\ntion into a market share game for firms seeking expansion. Market \nshare competition is a great deal more volatile than is the situation in \nwhich rapid industry growth insures that firms can improve results \njust by keeping up with the industry, and where all their financial \nand managerial resources may be consumed by expanding with the \nindustry. \nHigh Fixed or Storage Costs. High fixed costs create strong \npressures for all firms to fill capacity which often lead to rapidly es-\ncalating price cutting when excess capacity is present. Many basic \nmaterials like paper and aluminum suffer from this problem, for ex-\nample. The significant characteristic of costs is fixed costs relative to \nvalue added, and not fixed costs as a proportion of total costs. Firms \npurchasing a high proportion of costs in outside inputs (low value \nadded) may feel enormous pressures to fill capacity to break even, \ndespite the fact that the absolute proportion of fixed costs is low. \nA situation related to high fixed costs is one in which the prod-\nuct, once produced, is very difficult or costly to store.

This sort of pressure keeps profits low in industries like \nlobster fishing and the manufacture of certain hazardous chemicals \nand some service businesses. \nLack of Differentiation or Switching Costs. Where the prod-\nuct or service is perceived as a commodity or near commodity, \nchoice by the buyer is largely based on price and service, and pres-\nsures for intense price and service competition result. These forms of \ncompetition are particularly volatile, as has been discussed. Product \ndifferentiation, on the other hand, creates layers of insulation \nagainst competitive warfare because buyers have preferences and \nloyalites to particular sellers. Switching costs, described earlier, have \nthe same effect. \nCapacity Augmented in Large Increments. Where economies \nof scale dictate that capacity must be added in large increments, ca-\npacity additions can be chronically disruptive to the industry sup-\nply/demand balance, particularly where there is a risk of bunching \ncapacity additions. The industry may face recurring periods of over-\ncapacity and price cutting, like those that afflict the manufacture of \nchlorine, vinyl chloride, and ammonium fertilizer. The conditions \nleading to chronic overcapacity are discussed in Chapter 15. \nDiverse Competitors. Competitors diverse in strategies, ori-\ngins, personalities, and relationships to their parent companies have \ndiffering goals and differing strategies for how to compete and may \ncontinually run head on into each other in the process. They may \nhave a hard time reading each other's intentions accurately and \nagreeing on a set of \"rules of the game\" for the industry. Strategic \nchoices right for one competitor will be wrong for others. \nForeign competitors often add a great deal of diversity to indus-\ntries because of their differing circumstances and often differing \ngoals. Owner-operators of small manufacturing or service firms may \nas well, because they may be satisfied with a subnormal rate of re-\nturn on their invested capital to maintain the independence of self-\nownership, whereas such returns are unacceptable and may appear \nirrational to a large publicly held competitor. In such an industry, \nthe posture of the small firms may limit the profitability of the larger \nconcern.

Or a business unit that is a \"cash cow\" in its par-\nent company's portfolio of businesses will behave differently than \none that is being developed for long-run growth in view of a lack of \nother opportunities in the parent. (Some techniques for identifying \ndiversity in competitors will be developed in Chapter 3.) \nHigh Strategic Stakes. Rivalry in an industry becomes even \nmore volatile if a number of firms have high stakes in achieving suc-\ncess there. For example, a diversified firm may place great impor-\ntance on achieving success in a particular industry in order to further \nits overall corporate strategy. Or a foreign firm like Bosch, Sony, or \nPhilips may perceive a strong need to establish a solid position in the \nU.S. market in order to build global prestige or technological credi-\nbility.

Exit barriers are economic, strategic, and \nemotional factors that keep companies competing in businesses even \nthough they may be earning low or even negative returns on invest-\nment. The major sources7 of exit barriers are the following: \n• Specialized assets: assets highly specialized to the particular \nbusiness or location have low liquidation values or high costs \nof transfer or conversion. \n• Fixed costs of exit: these include labor agreements, resettle-\nment costs, maintaining capabilities for spare parts, and so \non. \n• Strategic interrelationships: interrelationships between the \nbusiness unit and others in the company in terms of image, \nmarketing ability, access to financial markets, shared facil-\nities, and so on. They cause the firm to attach high strategic \nimportance to being in the business. \n'For a fuller treatment see Chapter 12, which also illustrates how diagnosing exit \nbarriers is crucial in developing strategies for declining industries. \n",

Rather, they grimly hang on and, because of their weakness, \nhave to resort to extreme tactics. The profitability of the entire in-\ndustry can be persistently low as a result. \nSHIFTING RIVALRY \nThe factors that determine the intensity of competitive rivalry \ncan and do change. A very common example is the change in industry \ngrowth brought about by industry maturity. As an industry matures \nits growth rate declines, resulting in intensified rivalry, declining \nprofits, and (often) a shake-out. In the booming recreational vehicle \nindustry of the early 1970s nearly every producer did well, but slow \ngrowth since then has eliminated the high returns, except for the \nstrongest competitors, not to mention forcing many of the weaker \ncompanies out. The same story has been played out in industry after \nindustry: snowmobiles, aerosol packaging, and sports equipment are \njust a few examples. \nAnother common change in rivalry occurs when an acquisition \nintroduces a very different personality to an industry, as has been \nthe case with Philip Morris' acquisition of Miller Beer and Procter \nand Gamble's acquisition of Charmin Paper Company. Also, tech-\nnological innovation can boost the level of fixed costs in the produc-\ntion process and raise the volatility of rivalry, as it did in the shift \nfrom batch to continuous-line photofinishing in the 1960s. \nAlthough a company must live with many of the factors that \ndetermine the intensity of industry rivalry—because they are built in-\nto industry economics—it may have some latitude in improving mat-\nters through strategic shifts. For example, it may try to raise buyers' \nswitching costs by providing engineering assistance to customers to \ndesign its product into their operations or to make them dependent \nfor technical advice.

Here entry will be \ndeterred, and unsuccessful competitors will leave the industry. When \nboth entry and exit barriers are high, profit potential is high but is \nusually accompanied by more risk. Although entry is deterred, un-\nsuccessful firms will stay and fight in the industry. \nThe case of low entry and exit barriers is merely unexciting, but \nthe worst case is one in which entry barriers are low and exit barriers \nare high.

An industry might be in this unfortunate position, for \nexample, if suppliers or lenders will readily finance entry, but once \nin, the firm faces substantial fixed financing costs. \nPRESSURE FROM SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS \nAll firms in an industry are competing, in a broad sense, with \nindustries producing substitute products. Substitutes limit the poten-\ntial returns of an industry by placing a ceiling on the prices firms in \nthe industry can profitably charge.8 The more attractive the price-\nperformance alternative offered by substitutes, the firmer the lid on \nindustry profits. \nSugar producers confronted with the large-scale commercializa-\ntion of high fructose corn syrup, a sugar substitute, are learning this \nlesson today, as have the producers of acetylene and rayon who \nfaced extreme competition from alternative, lower-cost materials for \nmany of their respective applications. Substitutes not only limit \nprofits in normal times, but they also reduce the bonanza an industry \ncan reap in boom times. In 1978 the producers of fiberglass insula-\ntion enjoyed unprecedented demand as a result of high energy costs \nand severe winter weather. But the industry's ability to raise prices \nwas tempered by the plethora of insulation substitutes, including cel-\nlulose, rock wool, and styrofoam. These substitutes are bound to be-\ncome an ever stronger limit on profitability once the current round \nof plant additions has boosted capacity enough to meet demand (and \nthen some). \nIdentifying substitute products is a matter of searching for \nother products that can perform the same function as the product of \nthe industry. Sometimes doing so can be a subtle task, and one which \nleads the analyst into businesses seemingly far removed from the in-\ndustry. Securities brokers, for example, are being increasingly con-\nfronted with such substitutes as real estate, insurance, money market \nfunds, and other ways for the individual to invest capital, accen-\ntuated in importance by the poor performance of the equity markets. \nPosition vis-à-vis substitute products may well be a matter of \ncollective industry actions. For example, although advertising by \none firm may not be enough to bolster the industry's position against \n'The impact of substitutes can be summarized as the industry's overall elasticity of \ndemand. \n",

Similar \narguments apply to collective response in areas like product quality \nimprovement, marketing efforts, providing greater product avail-\nability, and so on. \nSubstitute products that deserve the most attention are those \nthat (1) are subject to trends improving their price-performance \ntradeoff with the industry's product, or (2) are produced by indus-\ntries earning high profits. In the latter case, substitutes often come \nrapidly into play if some development increases competition in their \nindustries and causes price reduction or performance improvement. \nAnalysis of such trends can be important in deciding whether to try \nto head off a substitute strategically or to plan strategy with it as \ninevitably a key force. In the security guard industry, for example, \nelectronic alarm systems represent a potent substitute. Moreover, \nthey can only become more important since labor-intensive guard \nservices face inevitable cost escalation, whereas electronic systems \nare highly likely to improve in performance and decline in costs. \nHere, the appropriate response of security guard firms is probably to \noffer packages of guards and electronic systems, based on a redefini-\ntion of the security guard as a skilled operator, rather than to try to \noutcompete electronic systems across the board. \nBARGAINING POWER OF BUYERS \nBuyers compete with the industry by forcing down prices, bar-\ngaining for higher quality or more services, and playing competitors \nagainst each other—all at the expense of industry profitability. The \npower of each of the industry's important buyer groups depends on \na number of characteristics of its market situation and on the rel-\native importance of its purchases from the industry compared with \nits overall business. A buyer group is powerful if the following cir-\ncumstances hold true: \nIt is concentrated or purchases large volumes relative to seller \nsales. If a large portion of sales is purchased by a given buyer this \nraises the importance of the buyer's business in results. Large-\nvolume buyers are particularly potent forces if heavy fixed costs \ncharacterize the industry—as they do in corn refining and bulk \nchemicals, for example—and raise the stakes to keep capacity filled. \n",

For example, the replacement market for most products \nis less price sensitive than the OEM market. (I will explore buyer \nselection as a strategy more fully in Chapter 6.) \nBARGAINING POWER OF SUPPLIERS \nSuppliers can exert bargaining power over participants in an in-\ndustry by threatening to raise prices or reduce the quality of pur-\nchased goods and services. Powerful suppliers can thereby squeeze \nprofitability out of an industry unable to recover cost increases in its \nown prices. By raising their prices, for example, chemical companies \nhave contributed to the erosion of profitability of contract aerosol \npackagers because the packagers, facing intense competition from \nself-manufacture by their buyers, accordingly have limited freedom \nto raise their prices. \nThe conditions making suppliers powerful tend to mirror those \nmaking buyers powerful. A supplier group is powerful if the follow-\ning apply: \n// is dominated by a few companies and is more concentrated \nthan the industry it sells to.

When suppliers sell to a number of industries and a particular \nindustry does not represent a significant fraction of sales, suppliers \nare much more prone to exert power.

Differentiation or switching costs facing the \nbuyers cut off their options to play one supplier against another. If \nthe supplier faces switching costs the effect is the reverse. \nThe supplier group poses a credible threat of forward integra-\ntion. This provides a check against the industry's ability to improve \nthe terms on which it purchases. \nWe usually think of suppliers as other firms, but labor must be \nrecognized as a supplier as well, and one that exerts great power in \nmany industries. There is substantial empirical evidence that scarce, \nhighly skilled employees and/or tightly unionized labor can bargain \naway a significant fraction of potential profits in an industry. The \nprinciples in determining the potential power of labor as a supplier \nare similar to those just discussed. The key additions in assessing the \npower of labor are its degree of organization, and whether the sup-\nply of scarce varieties of labor can expand.

In many \nindustries, government is a buyer or supplier and can influence in-\ndustry competition by the policies it adopts.

Cost leadership requires aggres-\nsive construction of efficient-scale facilities, vigorous pursuit of cost \nreductions from experience, tight cost and overhead control, avoid-\nance of marginal customer accounts, and cost minimization in areas \nlike R&D, service, sales force, advertising, and so on.

A low-cost position defends the firm against powerful buy-\ners because buyers can exert power only to drive down prices to the \nlevel of the next most efficient competitor. Low cost provides a de-\nfense against powerful suppliers by providing more flexibility to \ncope with input cost increases. The factors that lead to a low-cost po-\nsition usually also provide substantial entry barriers in terms of scale \neconomies or cost advantages. Finally, a low-cost position usually \nplaces the firm in a favorable position vis-à-vis substitutes relative to \nits competitors in the industry. Thus a low-cost position protects the \nfirm against all five competitive forces because bargaining can only \ncontinue to erode profits until those of the next most efficient com-\npetitor are eliminated, and because the less efficient competitors will \nsuffer first in the face of competitive pressures. \nAchieving a low overall cost position often requires a high rel-\native market share or other advantages, such as favorable access to \nraw materials. It may well require designing products for ease in man-\nufacturing, maintaining a wide line of related products to spread \ncosts, and serving all major customer groups in order to build vol-\nume. In turn, implementing the low-cost strategy may require heavy \nup-front capital investment in state-of-the art equipment, aggressive \npricing, and start-up losses to build market share. High market share \nmay in turn allow economies in purchasing which lower costs even \nfurther. Once achieved, the low-cost position provides high margins \nwhich can be reinvested in new equipment and modern facilities in \norder to maintain cost leadership. Such reinvestment may well be a \nprerequisite to sustaining a low-cost position. \nThe cost leadership strategy seems to be the cornerstone of \nBriggs and Stratton's success in small horsepower gasoline engines, \nwhere it holds a 50 percent worldwide share, and Lincoln Electric's \nsuccess in arc welding equipment and supplies.

All this al-\nlowed the company to offer an acceptable quality product and drop \nprices by 15 percent. Harnischfeger's market share has grown rapid-\nly to 25 percent and is continuing to grow.

It should be stressed that the dif-\nferentiation strategy does not allow the firm to ignore costs, but \nrather they are not the primary strategic target. \nDifferentiation, if achieved, is a viable strategy for earning \nabove-average returns in an industry because it creates a defensible \nposition for coping with the five competitive forces, albeit in a dif-\n\"'Hamischfeger's Dramatic Pickup in Cranes,\" Business Week, August 13,1979. \n",

Differentiation provides insulation \nagainst competitive rivalry because of brand loyalty by customers \nand resulting lower sensitivity to price. It also increases margins, \nwhich avoids the need for a low-cost position. The resulting custo-\nmer loyalty and the need for a competitor to overcome uniqueness \nprovide entry barriers. Differentiation yields higher margins with \nwhich to deal with supplier power, and it clearly mitigates buyer \npower, since buyers lack comparable alternatives and are thereby \nless price sensitive. Finally, the firm that has differentiated itself to \nachieve customer loyalty should be better positioned vis-à-vis substi-\ntutes than its competitors. \nAchieving differentiation may sometimes preclude gaining a \nhigh market share. It often requires a perception of exclusivity, \nwhich is incompatible with high market share.

Although the low cost \nand differentiation strategies are aimed at achieving their objectives \nindustrywide, the entire focus strategy is built around serving a par-\nticular target very well, and each functional policy is developed with \nthis in mind. The strategy rests on the premise that the firm is thus \nable to serve its narrow strategic target more effectively or efficiently \nthan competitors who are competing more broadly. As a result, the \nfirm achieves either differentiation from better meeting the needs of \nthe particular target, or lower costs in serving this target, or both. \nEven though the focus strategy does not achieve low cost or differen-\ntiation from the perspective of the market as a whole, it does achieve \n",

Cost declines with cu-\nmulative volume are by no means automatic, nor is reaping all avail-\nable economies of scale achievable without significant attention. \nCost leadership is vulnerable to the same risks, identified in \nChapter 1, of relying on scale or experience as entry barriers. Some \nof these risks are \n• technological change that nullifies past investments or learn-\ning; \n• low-cost learning by industry newcomers or followers, \nthrough imitation or through their ability to invest in state-\nof-the-art facilities; \n• inability to see required product or marketing change because \nof the attention placed on cost; \n• inflation in costs that narrow the firm's ability to maintain \nenough of a price differential to offset competitors' brand \nimages or other approaches to differentiation. \nThe classic example of the risks of cost leadership is the Ford \nMotor Company of the 1920s. Ford had achieved unchallenged cost \nleadership through limitation of models and varieties, aggressive \nbackward integration, highly automated facilities, and aggressive \npursuit of lower costs through learning. Learning was facilitated by \nthe lack of model changes. Yet as incomes rose and many buyers had \nalready purchased a car and were considering their second, the mar-\nket began to place more of a premium on styling, model changes, \ncomfort, and closed rather than open cars. Customers were willing \nto pay a price premium to get such features. General Motors stood \nready to capitalize on this development with a full line of models. \nFord faced enormous costs of strategic readjustment given the rigidi-\nties created by heavy investments in cost minimization of an obsolete \nmodel. \nAnother example of the risks of cost leadership as a sole focus is \nprovided by Sharp in consumer electronics.

Buyers thus sacrifice some of the fea-\ntures, services, or image possessed by the differentiated firm \nfor large cost savings; \n• buyers' need for the differentiating factor falls. This can oc-\ncur as buyers become more sophisticated; \n• imitation narrows perceived differentiation, a common oc-\ncurrence as industries mature. \nThe first risk is so important as to be worthy of further com-\nment. A firm may achieve differentiation, yet this differentiation \nwill usually sustain only so much of a price differential. Thus if a \ndifferentiated firm gets too far behind in. cost due to technological \nchange or simply inattention, the low cost firm may be in a position \nto make major inroads.

Similarly, a diagnosis of its goals will help deter-\nmine whether a corporate parent will seriously support an initiative \ntaken by one of its business units or whether it will back that busi-\nness unit's retaliation against moves of competitors. \nAlthough one most often thinks of financial goals, a compre-\nhensive diagnosis of a competitor's goals will usually include many \nmore qualitative factors, such as its targets in terms of market lead-\nership, technological position, social performance, and the like. Di-\nagnosis of goals should also be at multiple management levels. There \nare corporate-wide goals, business unit goals, and even goals that \ncan be deduced for individual functional areas and key managers. \nThe goals of higher levels play a part in, but do not fully determine, \nthe goals lower down. \nThe following diagnostic questions help to determine a competi-\ntor's present and future goals. We begin by considering the business \nunit or division, which in some cases will comprise the competitor's \nentire corporate entity. Then we examine the impact of the corporate \nparent on the future goals of the business unit in the diversified com-\npany. \nBUSINESS UNIT GOALS \n1. What are the stated and unstated financial goals of the com-\npetitor? How does the competitor make the trade-offs inherent in \ngoal setting, such as the trade-off between long-run and short-run \nperformance? Between profits and growth in revenue? Between \ngrowth and ability to pay regular dividends? \n2. What is the competitor's attitude toward risks! If financial \nobjectives essentially consist of profitability, market position (share), \nrate of growth, and desired level of risk, how does the competitor \nappear to balance these factors? \n3. Does the competitor have economic or noneconomic organi-\nzational values or beliefs, either widely shared or held by senior \nmanagement, which importantly affect its goals? Does it want to be \nthe market leader (Texas Instruments)? The industry statesman \n(Coca-Cola)? The maverick? The technological leader? Does it have \na tradition or history of following a particular strategy or functional \npolicy that has been institutionalized into a goal? Strongly held \nviews about product design or quality? Locational preferences? \n",

The competitor's organizational structure \nprovides some indication about the relative status of the various \nfunctional areas and the coordination and emphasis that are deemed \nstrategically important. For example, if the sales department is \nheaded by a senior vice-president who reports directly to the presi-\ndent, it is an indication that sales is more influential than manufac-\nturing if manufacturing is headed by a director who reports to the \nsenior vice-president for administration.

Why did the parent get into this business (because of excess \ncapacity, need for vertical integration, to exploit distribution chan-\nnels, for marketing strength)? This factor will give some further in-\ndication of the way in which the parent views the contribution of the \nbusiness and the probable pressure it will place on the unit's strategic \nposture and behavior. \n5. What is the economic relationship between the business and \nothers in the parent company's portfolio (vertical integration, com-\nplementary to other businesses, shared R&D)? What does this rela-\ntionship imply for special requirements the corporation may place \non the unit relative to the way it would behave as a free-standing \ncompany? Shared facilities, for example, may mean that the unit is \nunder pressure to cover overhead or absorb excess capacity gener-\nated by its sister units. Or if the unit is complementary to another di-\nvision in the parent, the parent may choose to take the profits else-\nwhere. Interrelationships with other units in the company may also \nimply cross-subsidies in one direction or another. \n6. What are the corporate-wide values or beliefs of top manage-\nment? Do they seek technological leadership in all their businesses? \nDo they desire level production and the avoidance of layoffs to carry \nout a corporate policy against unions?3 These sorts of corporate-\nwide values and beliefs will usually have an effect on the business \nunit. \n7. Is there a generic strategy that the parent has applied in a \nnumber of businesses and may attempt in this one? For example, Bic \nPen has employed a strategy of low-price, standardized, disposable \nproducts produced at very high volumes with heavy advertising to \ncompete in the areas of writing instruments, cigarette lighters, panty-\nhose, and now razors. Haynes Corporation is in the process of ap-\nplying the L'eggs strategy in pantyhose to such diverse businesses as \ncosmetics, men's underwear, and socks. \n8.

Similarly, a business \nthat is counted on to achieve stable sales may fight aggressively to do \nso even at the expense of profits, whereas it will react much less to a \nmove designed to boost a competitor's profits though leaving market \nshares the same. These are just some examples of how analysis of \ngoals can begin to answer the questions about competitors' behavior \nposed in Figure 3-1. \nASSUMPTIONS \nThe second crucial component in competitor analysis is identi-\nfying each competitor's assumptions. These fall into two major cate-\ngories: \n• The competitor's assumptions about itself \n• The competitor's assumptions about the industry and the \nother companies in it \nEvery firm operates on a set of assumptions about its own situa-\ntion. For example, it may see itself as a socially conscious firm, as \nthe industry leader, as the low-cost producer, as having the best sales \nforce, and so on. These assumptions about its own situation will \nguide the way the firm behaves and the way it reacts to events. If it \nsees itself as the low-cost producer, for example, it may try to disci-\npline a price cutter with price cuts of its own. \nA competitor's assumptions about its own situation may or may \nnot be accurate. Where they are not, this provides an intriguing stra-\ntegic lever. If a competitor believes it has the greatest customer loyal-\nty in the market and it does not, for example, a provocative price cut \nmay be a good way to gain position. The competitor might well re-\nfuse to match the price cut believing that it will have little impact on \nits share, only to find that it loses significant market position before \nit recognizes the error in its assumption. \nJust as each competitor holds assumptions about itself, every \nfirm also operates on assumptions about its industry and competi-\ntors. These also may or may not be correct.

The blind spots are areas where a competitor will either not see \nthe significance of events (such as a strategic move) at all, will per-\nceive them incorrectly, or will perceive them only very slowly. Root-\ning out these blind spots will help the firm identify moves with a \nlower probability of immediate retaliation and identify moves where \nretaliation, once it comes, is not effective. \nThe following questions are directed toward identifying compet-\nitors' assumptions and also areas where they are likely not to be \ncompletely dispassionate or realistic: \n1. What does the competitor appear to believe about its relative \nposition—in cost, product quality, technological sophistication, and \nother key aspects of its business—based on its public statements, \nclaims of management and sales force, and other indications? What \ndoes it see as its strengths and weaknesses? Are these accurate? \n2. Does the competitor have strong historical or emotional \nidentification with particular products or with particular functional \npolicies, such as an approach to product design, desire for product \nquality, manufacturing location, selling approach, distribution ar-\nrangements, and so on, which will be strongly held to? \n3. Are there cultural, regional, or national differences that will \naffect the way in which competitors perceive and assign significance \nto events? To take one of many examples, West German companies \nare sometimes very oriented toward production and product quality, \nat the expense of unit costs and marketing. \n4. Are there organizational values or canons which have been \nstrongly institutionalized and will affect the way events are viewed? \nAre there some policies that the company's founder believed in \nstrongly that may still linger? \n5. What does the competitor appear to believe about future de-\nmand for the product and about the significance of industry trends! \nWill it be hesitant to add capacity because of unfounded uncertain-\nties about demand, or likely to overbuild for the opposite reason? Is \nit prone to misestimate the importance of particular trends? Does it \nbelieve the industry is concentrating, for example, when it may not \nbe?

According to reports, most breweries laughed at Miller's \nmoves, but many have now grudgingly followed as Miller made ma-\njor gains in market share.7 \nAnother situation in which the recognition of outdated conven-\ntional wisdom has been credited with yielding great rewards is in the \nturnaround of Paramount Pictures. Two new senior executives with \nbackgrounds in network television management have violated many \nindustry norms in the movie industry—presetting of films, releasing \nfilms simultaneously in large numbers of theaters, and so on—and \nregistered major gains in market share.8 \n'These are particularly likely to exist in industries composed of competitors with a \nlong tradition in the industry. \n'For a brief account, see Business Week, November 8, 1976. \n\"For a brief description, see Business Week, November 27,1978. \n",

The following questions suggest some ways to examine these \nareas: \n1. What is the competitor's current financial performance and \nmarket share, compared to that of the relatively recent past? This \ncan be a good first indication of future goals, particularly if results \nof the \"rememberable\" past were somewhat better and provide a \ntangible and annoyingly visible indicator of the competitor's poten-\ntial. The competitor will almost always be striving to regain the per-\nformance of the recent past. \n2. What has been the competitor's history in the marketplace \nover time? Where has it failed or been beaten, and thus perhaps not \nlikely to tread again? The memory of past failures, and the impedi-\nments to further moves in those areas they bring, can be very lasting \nand given disproportionate weight. This is particularly true in gener-\nally successful organizations. For example, some argue that a past \nfailure with discount stores delayed Federated Department Stores' \nreentry into this area of retailing for seven years. \n3. In what areas has the competitor starred or succeeded as a \ncompany? In new product introductions? Innovative marketing \ntechniques? Others? In such areas the competitor may feel confident \nto initiate a move again or to do battle in the event of a provocation. \n4. How has the competitor reacted to particular strategic moves \nor industry events in the past? Rationally? Emotionally? Slowly? \nQuickly? What approaches have been employed? To what sorts of \nevents has the competitor reacted poorly, and why? \nMANAGERIAL BACKGROUNDS AND ADVISORY \nRELATIONSHIPS \nAnother key indicator of a competitor's goals, assumptions, \nand probable future moves is where its leadership has come from \nand what the managers' track records and personal successes and \nfailures have been. \n1.

Current examples could be Edwin Land's penchant for \nradical innovation as a solution to strategic problems at Polaroid, \nand McGee's strategy of retrenchment to energy-related activities at \nGulf Oil. \n2. A second clue to the top managers' assumptions, goals, and \nprobable future moves is the types of strategies that have worked or \nnot worked for them personally in their careers. For example, if cut-\nting costs was a successful remedy for a problem facing the CEO in \nthe past, it may be adopted the next time a remedy is needed. \n3. Another dimension of the top managers' backgrounds that \ncan be important is the other businesses they have worked in and \nwhat rules of the game and strategic approaches have been charac-\nteristic of those businesses. For example, Marc Roijtman applied a \nstrategy of salesmanship, implemented successfully in industrial \nequipment, to the farm equipment business when he assumed the \npresidency of J. I. Case in the mid-1960s. R. J. Reynolds has recent-\nly brought in new leadership from consumer packaged food and toi-\nletries companies that has introduced many of the product manage-\nment and other practices characteristic of those businesses. And the \nrecently retired top management of Household Finance Corporation \n(HFC) came from the retail industry. Rather than bolster HFC's \nstrong position in consumer credit and capitalize on the consumer \ncredit boom, the company spent its resources diversifying into retail-\ning. A new CEO, promoted from the consumer finance division, has \nreversed this direction. This tendency to reuse concepts that have \nworked in the past applies to senior executives coming from law \nfirms, consulting firms, and from other companies in the industry. \nAll can bring to the competitor a perspective and tool kit of remedies \nto some extent reflecting their past. \n4. Top managers can be greatly influenced by major events they \nhave lived through, such as a sharp recession, traumatic energy \nshortage, major loss due to currency fluctuations, and so on. Such \nevents sometimes broadly affect the perspective of the manager in a \nwide range of areas and can influence strategic choices accordingly. \n5. Indications of top managers' perspectives can also be gained \nfrom their writing and speaking, their technical background or pat-\nent history where applicable, other firms they come into frequent \ncontact with (such as through boards of directors they sit on), their \noutside activities, and a range of other clues limited only by the \nimagination. \n",

Management consulting firms, advertising agencies, invest-\nment banks, and other advisors used by the competitor can be im-\nportant clues. What other companies use these advisors and what \nhave they done? What conceptual approaches and techniques are the \nadvisors known for? The identity of a competitor's advisors and a \nthorough diagnosis of them can provide an indication of future stra-\ntegic changes. \nCURRENT STRATEGY \nThe third component of competitor analysis is developing state-\nments of the current strategy of each competitor. A competitor's \nstrategy is most usefully thought of as its key operating policies in \neach functional area of the business and how it seeks to interrelate \nthe functions. This strategy may be either explicit or implicit—one \nalways exists in one form or the other. The principles of strategy \nidentification have been discussed in the Introduction. \nCAPABILITIES \nA realistic appraisal of each competitor's capabilities is the final \ndiagnostic step in competitor analysis. Its goals, assumptions, and \ncurrent strategy will influence the likelihood, timing, nature, and in-\ntensity of a competitor's reactions. Its strengths and weaknesses will \ndetermine its ability to initiate or react to strategic moves and to deal \nwith environmental or industry events that occur. \nSince the notion of a competitor's strengths and weaknesses is \nrelatively clear, I will not dwell on it here. Broadly, strengths and \nweaknesses can be assessed by examining a competitor's position \nwith respect to the five key competitive forces discussed in Chapter \n1, an analysis I will pursue in Chapter 7. Taking a narrower perspec-\ntive, Figure 3-2 gives a summary framework for looking at a compet-\nitor's strengths and weaknesses in each key area of the business.9 A \nlist such as this can be made more useful by asking some additional, \nsynthesizing questions. \n'For other sources of areas to look at in assessing capabilities, see Robert Buchele, \n\"How to Evaluate a Firm,\" California Management Review, Fall 1962, pp. 5-16; \n\"Checklist for Competitive and Competence Profiles,\" in H.

These can be assessed against the following criteria \nto determine the competitor's defensive capability, with inputs com-\ning from the analysis in previous sections. \n1. Vulnerability. To what strategic moves and governmental, \nmacroeconomic or industry events would the competitor be most \nvulnerable? What events have asymmetrical profit consequences, \nthat is, affect a competitor's profits more or less than they affect the \ninitiating firm's? What moves would require so much capital to re-\ntaliate against or follow that the competitor cannot risk them? \n2. Provocation. What moves or events are such that they will \nprovoke a retaliation from competitors even though retaliation may \nbe costly and lead to marginal financial performance? That is, what \nmoves threaten a competitor's goals or position so much that it will \nbe forced to retaliate, like it or not? Most competitors will have hot \nbuttons, or areas of the business where a threat will lead to a dispro-\nportionate response. Hot buttons reflect strongly held goals, emo-\ntional commitments, and the like. Where possible, they are to be \navoided. \n3. Effectiveness of retaliation. To what moves or events is the \ncompetitor impeded from reacting to quickly and/or effectively \ngiven its goals, strategy, existing capabilities, and assumptions? \nWhat courses of action might be taken in which the competitor \nwould not be effective if it tries to match or emulate them? \nFigure 3-3 presents a simple schematic diagram for analyzing a \ncompetitor's defensive capabilities.

These events can then be subjected \nto the questions listed across the top. The resulting matrix should \nhelp pick the most effective strategy, given the reality that competi-\ntors will respond, and can facilitate rapid response to industry and \nenvironmental events that will expose a competitor's weaknesses. \n(Concepts for making competitive moves are discussed in detail in \nChapter 5.) \nPICKING THE BATTLEGROUND \nAssuming that competitors will retaliate to moves a firm initi-\nates, its strategic agenda is selecting the best battleground for fighting \nit out with its competitors. This battleground is the market segment \nor dimensions of strategy in which competitors are ill-prepared, least \nenthusiastic, or most uncomfortable about competing. The best bat-\ntleground may be competition based on costs, centered at the high or \nlow end of the product line, or other areas. \nThe ideal is to find a strategy that competitors are frozen from \nreacting to given their present circumstances. The legacy of their \npast and current strategy may make some moves very costly for com-\npetitors to follow, while posing much less difficulty and expense for \nthe initiating firm. For example, when Folger's Coffee invaded Max-\nwell House strongholds in the east with price cutting, the cost of \nmatching these cuts were enormous for Maxwell House because of \nits large market share. \nAnother key strategic concept deriving from competitor analy-\nsis is creating a situation of mixed motives or conflicting goals for \ncompetitors. This strategy involves finding moves for which retalia-\ntion, though effective, would hurt the competitor's broader posi-\ntion. For example, as IBM responds to the threat of the minicom-\nputer with its own minicomputer, it may hasten the decline in growth \nof its large computers and accelerate the changeover to minicomput-\ners. Placing competitors in a situation of conflicting goals can be a \nvery effective strategic approach for attacking established firms that \nhave been successful in their markets. Small firms and newly entered \nfirms often have very little legacy in the existing strategies in the in-\ndustry and can reap great rewards from finding strategies that penal-\nize competitors for their stake in these existing strategies. \n",

To be effective, there is \nthe need for an organized mechanism—some sort of competitor in-\ntelligence system—to insure that the process is efficient. The ele-\nments of a competitor intelligence system can vary according to the \nparticular firm's needs, based on its industry, its staff capability, \nand its managements' interests and talents.

Bluffs are signals designed to \nmislead other firms into taking or not taking an action to benefit the \nsignaler. Discerning the difference between a bluff and a true signal \ncan often involve subtle judgments. \nMarket signals take a variety of forms, depending on the partic-\nular competitor behavior involved and the medium employed. In dis-\ncussing different forms of signals, it will be important to indicate \nhow they may be used as bluffs, and how a bluff and a true signal \nmight be distinguished. \nThe important forms of market signals are as follows: \nPRIOR ANNOUNCEMENTS OF MOVES \nThe form, character, and timing of prior announcements can be \npotent signals. A prior announcement is a formal communication \nmade by a competitor that it either will or vv/7/ not take some action, \nsuch as building a plant, changing price, and so on. An announce-\nment does not necessarily insure that an action will be taken; an-\nnouncements can be made that are not carried out in practice, either \nbecause nothing was done or a later announcement nullified the ac-\ntion. This property of announcements adds to their signaling value, \nas will be discussed. \nIn general, prior announcements can serve a number of signal-\ning functions that are not mutually exclusive. First, they can be at-\ntempts to stake out a commitment to take an action for the purposes \nof preempting other competitors. If a competitor announces a major \nnew capacity addition which is sufficient to meet all expected indus-\ntry growth, for example, it may be trying to dissuade other firms \nfrom adding capacity, which would lead to industry overcapacity. \n",

If firm A learns \nof competitor B's intentions to lower its price on selected items in the \nproduct line (or competitor B announces such intentions), for exam-\nple, then firm A might announce the intention to lower its price sig-\nnificantly below B's. This may deter B from going through with the \nprice change, because B now knows that A is unhappy with the lower \nprice and is willing to start a price war. \nThird, announcements can be tests of competitor sentiments, \ntaking advantage of the fact that they need not necessarily be carried \nout. Firm A might announce a new warranty program to see how \nothers in the industry will react. If they react predictably, then.4 will \nfollow through with the change as planned. If competitors send sig-\nnals of displeasure or announce somewhat different warranty pro-\ngrams than A has proposed, then A might either withdraw the \nplanned move or announce a revised warranty program to match \nthat of its competitors. \nThis sequence of actions suggests a fourth role of announce-\nments related to their role as threats. Announcements can be a \nmeans of communicating pleasure or displeasure with competitive \ndevelopments in the industry.3 Announcing a move that falls in line \nwith a competitor's move might indicate pleasure, whereas announc-\ning a punishing move or a substantially different approach to the \nsame end can indicate displeasure. \nA fifth and common function of announcements is to serve as \nconciliatory steps aimed at minimizing the provocation of a forth-\n2See Brock (1975). \n'Competitors can also comment on their pleasure or displeasure directly through \ninterviews, speeches to security analysts, and so on. But announcing that they will \ndo something, in response to a firm's move, is usually a more binding commit-\nment to their position than mere statements of pleasure or displeasure. This is be-\ncause reneging on an announcement carries a greater cost in credibility than taking \nan action inconsistent with what was said in an interview or speech. Sometimes in-\nterviews and speeches are used to signal displeasure to cause another firm to \nchange its mind, and if this tactic is not successful an announcement is made that \nthe firm will follow the move. \n",

The announcement seeks to avoid hav-\ning a strategic adjustment touch off a round of unwelcomed retalia-\ntion and warfare. For example, firm A might decide that price levels \nneed to be adjusted downward in the industry. Announcing this \nmove well ahead of time, and justifying it in terms of specific \nchanges in costs, can avoid having firm B read the price change as an \naggressive bid for market share and retaliating vigorously. This role \nof announcements is particularly common when a necessary strate-\ngic adjustment is not meant to be aggressive. However, announce-\nments like these can also be designed to lull competitors into a sense \nof security in order to facilitate the implementation of an aggressive \nmove. This is one of many instances when a signal can be a double-\nedged sword. \nA sixth function of announcements is to avoid costly simulta-\nneous moves in areas like capacity additions, where bunching of new \nplant additions would lead to overcapacity. Firms might announce \nexpansion plans well in advance, facilitating the scheduling of capac-\nity additions by competitors in a sequence that will minimize overca-\npacity.4 \nA final function of announcements can be communication with \nthe financial community, for purposes of boosting stock price or im-\nproving the reputation of the company. This common practice \nmeans that firms often have a public relations motive in presenting \ntheir situation in the best possible light. Announcements of this char-\nacter can cause trouble by sending inappropriate signals to compet-\nitors. \nAnnouncements can also sometimes serve the purpose of coa-\nlescing internal support for a move. Committing the firm to do \nsomething publicly can be a way of cutting off internal debate about \nits desirability. Announcements of financial goals not infrequently \nserve this function of rallying support. \nIt should be clear from the above discussion that an entire com-\npetitive battle can be waged through announcements before a single \ndollar of resources is expended. A fairly recent sequence of an-\nnouncements among producers of computer memories provides an \nillustration of this occurrence. Texas Instruments announced a price \nfor random access memories to be available two years hence. One \nweek later, Bowmar announced a lower price. Three weeks later, \nMotorola announced an even lower price. Finally, two weeks after \n4Such a process not infrequently breaks down. See Chapter 15, \"Capacity Ex-\npansion.\" \n",

Thus, before \nany major investments were actually made, Texas Instruments had \nwon the battle.5 Similarly, trading announcements back and forth \ncan settle the size of a price change or form of a new dealer rebate \nprogram without the need to disrupt the market and risk a battle by \nactually introducing one scheme and then having to change or with-\ndraw it later. \nDiscerning whether a prior announcement is an attempt at pre-\nemption or is a conciliatory move is obviously a crucial distinction to \nmake correctly. A place to start in making such a distinction is with \nan analysis of the lasting benefits that might accrue to the competi-\ntor from preemption.6 If there are such lasting benefits, a preemp-\ntive motive must be taken as a strong possibility. If there are few \nbenefits from preemption, on the other hand, or if the competitor \nacting in its narrow self-interest could have done better through a \nsurprise move, then conciliation may be indicated. An announce-\nment that discloses an action much less damaging to others than it \nmight have been, given the competitor's capabilities, may usually be \nviewed as conciliatory. Another clue to motives is the timing of the \nannouncement relative to when the action is set to occur. Announce-\nments far in advance of a move tend to be conciliatory, other things \nbeing equal, though it is difficult to generalize completely. \nIt should be clearly noted that announcements can be bluffs, be-\ncause they need not always be carried out. As described, an an-\nnouncement can be a way to communicate a firm's commitment to \ncarrying out a threat for purposes of causing a competitor to either \nback down from or tone down a move or to not initiate it in the first \nplace. For example, a firm can announce a large plant designed to \nmaintain its share of industry capacity in the face of other capacity \nannouncements it seeks to have cancelled, where the effect of its \nplant will be to create major overcapacity in the industry. If a bluff \nfor these purposes fails, there may be little incentive for the bluffer \nto carry out the threat. However, whether or not a threat or other \ncommitment is carried out has critical implications for the credibility \nof future commitments and future announcements. In extreme cases \n'For such an outcome to occur Texas Instruments must have also credibly \ndemonstrated its commitment, from other actions, that it would actually sell \nmemories at the low prices.

The \nmedium chosen for the announcement is one clue to its underlying \nmotives. The more formal the announcement, the more the an-\nnouncing firm wants to be sure that the message will be heard, and \nthe broader the audience it probably seeks to reach. The medium for \nthe announcement also affects who will see it. An announcement in a \nspecialized trade journal is likely to be noticed only by competitors \nor other industry participants. This may carry a different connota-\ntion from an announcement made to a broad audience of security \nanalysis or to the national business press. A prior announcement to a \nbroad audience may be a way of establishing a \"public\" commit-\nment to do something that is perceived by competitors as being hard \nto back down from, with the consequent deterrent value.7 \nANNOUNCEMENTS OF RESULTS OR ACTIONS AFTER THE \nFACT \nFirms often announce (verify) plant additions, sales figures, and \nother results or actions after they have occurred. Such announce-\nments may carry signals, particularly to the degree that they disclose \ndata that are hard to get otherwise and/or are surprising for the an-\nnouncing firm to make public. The after-the-fact announcement has \nthe function of insuring that other firms know and take note of the \ndata disclosed—which can influence their behavior. \nLike any announcement, an ex post announcement can be wrong \nor more likely misleading, although this does not seem to be com-\nmon. Many such announcements refer to data like market shares \nthat are not audited nor are subject to full SEC screening procedures \nand liability. Firms sometimes announce misleading data if they be-\nlieve such data can be preemptive or can communicate commitment. \nAn example of this tactic is announcing sales figures that include the \nsales of some related products outside the narrow product category \nin the total, that is, inflating apparent market share.

It may be self-serving \nby slanting the interpretation of the desirability of the competitor's \nmove so that its own position is improved. \nSometimes firms praise competitors by name or the industry \ngenerally.

First, it may \nbe an attempt to get other firms to see the logic of a move and hence \nfollow it or to communicate that the move is not to be taken as a \nprovocation. Second, explanations or discussions of moves can be \npreemptive gestures. Firms introducing a new product or entering a \nnew market sometimes fill the press with stories about how costly \nand difficult the move was to make. This may deter other firms from \ntrying. Finally, such discussions of moves may be an attempt to \ncommunicate commitment. The competitor can stress the large \namount of resources expended and its long-run commitment to a \nnew area to try to convince rivals that it is there to stay and to not at-\ntempt to displace it. \n",

These diver-\ngences should probably lead to a period of intense attention to sig-\nnaling and competitor analysis. \nDIVERGENCE FROM INDUSTRY PRECEDENT \nA move that diverges from industry norms is usually an aggres-\nsive signal. Examples include discounting products that have never \nbeen discounted in the industry and plant construction in an entirely \nnew geographic area or new country. \nTHE CROSS-PARRY \nWhen one firm initiates a move in one area and a competitor re-\nsponds in a different area with one that affects the initiating firm, \nthe situation can be called a cross-parry. This situation occurs not in-\nfrequently when firms compete in different geographic areas or have \nmultiple product lines that do not completely overlap. For example, \nan East-Coast-based firm entering the western market may see a \nwestern firm in turn entering the eastern market. A situation not far \nfrom this occurred in the roasted coffee industry. Maxwell House \nhas long been strong in the East, whereas Folger's strength is in the \nWest. Folger's, acquired by Procter and Gamble, moved to increase \nits penetration in the eastern markets through some aggressive mar-\nketing. Maxwell countered, in part, by cutting prices and raising \nmarketing expenditures in some of Folger's key western markets. \nAnother example may be occurring in the machinery sector. Deere \nentered the earthmoving industry in the late 1950s with a strategy \nsimilar to Caterpillar's. Deere has recently pushed even harder to \npenetrate some of Caterpillar's key markets. Rumors are now ram-\npant that Caterpillar is planning to enter the farm equipment indus-\ntry, where Deere is strong.

By responding indirectly, the defending firm may well be try-\ning not to trigger a set of destructive moves and countermoves in the \nencroached-upon market but yet clearly to signal displeasure and \nraise the threat of serious retaliation later. \n' 'A rumor, as well as an actual move, can serve as a cross-parry. \n",

A re-\nsponse in a minor market may also signal that the defender will raise \nthe ante with a more threatening cross-parry later if the initiator \ndoes not back off. \nThe cross-parry can be a particularly effective way to discipline \na competitor if there is a great divergence of market shares. For ex-\nample, if the cross-parry involves a price cut, the cost of meeting this \nprice cut for the firm with the bigger share may be a lot greater than \nfor the firm sending the signal. This fact can increase the pressure \nplaced on the original instigator to back off. \nAn implication of all this analysis is that maintaining a small \nposition in such cross-markets can be a useful potential deterrent. \nTHE FIGHTING BRAND \nA form of signal related to the cross-parry is the fighting brand. \nA firm threatened or potentially threatened by another can introduce \na brand that has the effect—whether this is the only motivation for \nthe brand or not—of punishing or threatening to punish the source \nof the threat.

Thus \nsuccess can be assured only if the competitors choose to or are influ-\nenced to respond in a non-destructive way. \nIn an oligopoly the firm often faces a dilemma.

The greater the number of competitors, the more equal \ntheir relative power, the more standardized their products, the \nhigher their fixed costs and other conditions that tempt them to try \nto fill capacity, and the slower the industry's growth, the greater is \nthe likelihood that there will be repeated efforts by firms to pursue \ntheir own self-interest.

Similarly, the more diverse \nor asymmetrical are competitors' goals and perspectives, the greater \ntheir strategic stakes in the particular business and the less seg-\nmented the market, the harder it will be to properly interpret each \nothers' moves and sustain a cooperative outcome. Broadly speaking, \nboth offensive and defensive moves are more risky if these condi-\ntions favor intense rivalry. \nSome other conditions in an industry can make outbreaks of ri-\nvalry more or less likely.

Using \nthe techniques described in Chapter 3, it is necessary to examine the \nprobable moves each competitor will make, the threat provided by \nmoves made by its rivals, and the ability of each competitor to de-\nfend itself effectively against such moves. This analysis is a prerequi-\nsite to developing strategies for deterrence or in deciding where and \nhow to make offensive moves. Here it will be assumed that such \nanalysis has already been done. \nThe final part of assessing industry instability is determining the \nnature of the information flow among firms in the market, including \nthe extent of their shared knowledge of industry conditions, and \nability to communicate intentions effectively through signaling. This \nflow of information will be a central focus of this chapter. \nCompetitive Moves \nBecause in an oligopoly a firm is partly dependent on the behav-\nior of its rivals, selecting the right competitive move involves finding \none whose outcome is quickly determined (no protracted or serious \nbattle takes place) and also skewed as much as possible toward the \nfirm's own interests. That is, the goal for the firm is to avoid desta-\nbilizing and costly warfare, which spells poor results for all partici-\npants, but yet still outperform other firms. \nOne broad approach is to use superior resources and capabilities \nto force an outcome skewed toward the interests of the firm, over-\ncoming and outlasting retaliation—we might call this the brute force \napproach. This sort of approach is possible only if the firm possesses \nclear superiorities, and it is stable only as long as the firm maintains \nthese superiorities and as long as competitors do not misread them \nand incorrectly attempt to change their positions. \n",

A \nfirm's strengths and weaknesses (Chapter 3) certainly help define the \nopportunities and threats it faces. However, even sheer resources are \noften not enough to insure the right outcome if competitors will be \ntough (or worse, desperate or seemingly irrational) in their responses \nor if competitors are pursuing greatly different objectives. More-\nover, possession of clear strengths is not always realistically avail-\nable to every firm seeking to improve its strategic position. Finally, \neven with clear strengths, a war of attrition is costly to the victor and \nvanquished alike and is best avoided. \nCompetitive moves are also a game of finesse. The game can be \nstructured and moves selected and executed in such a way as to maxi-\nmize their outcome no matter what resources are available to the \nfirm. Ideally, a battle of retaliation never begins at all. Making com-\npetitive moves in oligopoly is best thought of as a combination of \nwhatever brute force the firm can muster, applied with finesse. \nCOOPERATIVE OR NONTHREATENING MOVES \nMoves that do not threaten competitors' goals are a place to be-\ngin in searching for ways to improve position. Based on a thorough \nanalysis of competitors' goals and assumptions, using the frame-\nwork in Chapter 3, there may be moves the firm can make to in-\ncrease its profits (or even its share) that do not reduce the perform-\nance of its significant competitors or threaten their goals unduly. \nThree categories of such moves can be usefully distinguished: \n• moves that improve the firm's position and improve competi-\ntors' positions even //they do not match them; \n• moves that improve the firm's position and improve competi-\ntors' positions only if a significant number match them; \n• moves that improve the firm's position because competitors \nwill not match them. \nThe first case involves the least risk if such moves can be identi-\nfied. One possibility is that the firm may be engaged in practices that \nnot only diminish its performance but also spill over to diminish the \nperformance of competitors, such as an inappropriate advertising \ncampaign or poor pricing structure out of line with the industry. The \nexistence of such possibilities is a reflection of weak past strategy. \n",

    "chunk_full": "Competitive Moves \n93 \nThe second case is more common. In most industries, there are \nmoves that would improve everybody's situation if all firms fol-\nlowed. For example, if every firm reduced its warranty from two \nyears to one year, all the firms' costs would fall and profitability \nwould increase, provided that aggregate industry demand was not \nsensitive to warranty terms. Another example is a change in costs \nthat calls for a price adjustment. The problem with such moves is \nthat all firms may not follow, because the move, though improving \ntheir positions absolutely, is not optimal for them. For example, the \nfirm with the highest product reliability will lose a competitive ad-\nvantage if the warranty period is reduced. Competitors also may not \nfollow because one or more firms see the chance to improve their rel-\native position by not following, assuming that others do follow. \nIn selecting a move of this second type, the key steps are (1) as-\nsessing the impact of the move on each and every major competi-\ntor, and (2) assessing the pressures on each competitor to forego the \nbenefits of cooperating for the possible benefits of breaking ranks. \nThis assessment is a problem in competitor analysis. When making \nmoves whose success is contingent on competitors following, the risk \nis that competitors will not follow. This risk is not great if the chosen \nmove can be cheaply rescinded or if shifts in relative company posi-\ntion are either slow to occur or easy to redress. However, such a \nmove can be very risky if the relative positions potentially gained by \nfirms that choose not to participate are significant and hard to win \nback. \nIdentifying the third category of nonthreatening moves—moves \nthat competitors will not follow—depends on a careful understand-\ning of the opportunities provided by competitors' particular goals \nand assumptions. It involves finding moves to which competitors \nwill not respond because they do not perceive a need to do so. For \nexample, a competitor may attach little significance to the Latin \nAmerican market, focusing instead on Canada as an export opportu-\nnity. Inroads into Latin America at the expense of local companies \nmay not matter at all to this competitor. \nMoves will be perceived as nonthreatening if: \n• competitors do not even notice, because the adjustments are \nlargely internal for the firm making them; \n• competitors will not be concerned about them because of \ntheir self-perceptions or assumptions about the industry and \nhow to compete in it; \n",

This watch was sold through drugstores and other \nnonconventional watch outlets instead of through jewelry stores. \nThe Swiss dominated the world watch industry at the time with high-\nquality, high-priced watches sold through jewelry stores and mar-\nketed as precision instruments. The Swiss industry was growing \nbriskly in the early 1950s. The Timex watch was so different from \nthe Swiss watch that the Swiss did not seem to perceive it as competi-\ntion at all. It did not threaten their image of quality, nor did it \nthreaten their position with jewelers or as the leading producers of \nhigh-quality, high-priced watches. The Timex watch probably cre-\nated primary demand initially, rather than taking sales from the \nSwiss. Furthermore, the Swiss were growing, and Timex was no \nthreat to their performance at all initially. As a result, Timex was \nable to gain a secure foothold in the lower end of the market without \neven attracting the attention of the Swiss. \nExecuting moves so as to improve everyone's position requires \nthat competitors understand that the move is not threatening.

Active \nmarket signaling (Chapter 4) through announcements, public com-\nmentary about the change, and the like is one option in indicating \nbenign intentions. For example, an elaborate discussion in the press \nof cost increases that justify making a price change may help com-\nmunicate intentions. The firm making such a move also can disci-\npline competitors who fail to follow, such as through selective adver-\ntising campaigns or selling efforts directed at those competitors' \ncustomers.

Lags \nin retaliation stem from four basic sources: \n• perceptual lags; \n• lags in mounting a retaliatory strategy; \n• inability to pinpoint retaliation, which raises its short-run cost; \n• lags caused by conflicting goals or mixed motives. \nThe first source, perceptual lags, involves delay in competitors \nperceiving or noticing the initial strategic move, either because the \nmove was kept secret or introduced quietly away from competitors' \ncenters of attention (e.g., with small customers or foreign custom-\ners). Sometimes, by being secretive or keeping a low profile, a firm \ncan make a move or build a new capability before competitors can \neffectively retaliate. Also, competitors may not immediately per-\nceive a move as significant because of their goals, perceptions of the \nmarketplace, and so on. The example of the introduction of the \nTimex watch serves here as well. Long after Timex began to cut into \nthe sales of the Swiss and American producers, the Timex watch was \nseen by them as an inferior junk product not requiring retaliation. \nPerceptual lags depend partly on the mechanisms firms have in \nplace for monitoring competitive behavior, and these lags can be in-\nfluenced. When competitors are dependent on outside statistical \nsources like trade associations to provide the base data against which \nthey compute market share, then they may not be able to notice \nmoves until such data are published. Perceptual lags may sometimes \nbe lengthened by diversionary tactics, such as introducing a product \nor making some other move in an area away from that in which the \nkey initiative is to take place. From a defensive point of view percep-\ntual lags may be shortened by having a competitor monitoring sys-\ntem in place which continually assembles data from the field sales-\nforce, distributors, and so on. With careful monitoring, competitors \ncan actually learn about moves ahead of time because the competitor \nmust make advance commitments for advertising space, equipment \ndelivery, and the like. If systems for competitor monitoring are \nknown to competitors, all the better for deterrence. \nLags in mounting a retaliatory campaign vary with the type of \ninitial move. Retaliation to a price cut can be immediate, but it may \ntake years for a defensive research effort to match a product change \nor for modern capacity to be put on stream to match a competitor's \nnew plant.

A firm can pick offensive moves against which competitors \nface a slow process of mounting effective retaliation, given natural \nlead times coupled with internal weaknessses. From a defensive \nstandpoint, retaliation time can be shortened by building up retalia-\ntory resources even though they may never be used. For example, \nnew product offerings may be developed but held in reserve, machin-\nery can be ordered at the risk of modest cancellation payments, and \nsoon. \nLags caused by the inability to pinpoint retaliation are analo-\ngous to the problem of having to disassemble an entire television set \nto replace one faulty transistor. Particularly for larger firms reacting \nto moves by smaller ones, retaliatory moves may have to be general-\nized to all customers rather than restricted to the customers or mar-\nket segments that are being contested. For example, to match a price \ncut by a small competitor, a large firm may have to give a price dis-\ncount to all its customers, at enormous expense. If a firm can find \nmoves that are much less costly for it to make than they are for its \ncompetitors to respond to, it can produce lags in retaliation and \nsometimes even deter retaliation altogether. \nLags in retaliation caused by conflicting goals or mixed motives \nare a final important situation which has wide applicability in the \nstudy of competitive interaction. This is the situation, introduced in \nChapter 3, in which one firm makes a move that threatens some of a \ncompetitor's business, but if the competitor retaliates quickly and \nvigorously, it hurts itself elsewhere in its business. This effect poten-\ntially creates a lag in retaliation (and a reduction in its effectiveness) \nor even prevents retaliation altogether.

Ag-\ngressive retaliation against Timex would have helped legitimize the \nTimex concept, threatened the needed cooperation of jewelers in \nselling Swiss watches, and blurred the Swiss product image. Thus the \nSwiss retaliation to Timex never really came. \nThere are many other examples of this principle at work. Volks-\nwagen's and American Motor's early strategies of producing a \nstripped-down basic transportation vehicle with few style changes \ncreated a similar dilemma for the Big Three auto producers. They \nhad a strategy built on trade-up and frequent model changes. Bic's \nrecent introduction of the disposable razor has put Gillette in a diffi-\ncult position: if it reacts it may cut into the sales of another product \nin its broad line of razors, a dilemma Bic does not face.4 Finally, \nIBM has been reluctant to jump into minicomputers because the \nmove will jeopardize its sales of larger mainframe computers. \nFinding strategic moves that will benefit from a lag in retalia-\ntion, or making moves so as to maximize the lag, are key principles \nof competitive interaction. However, seeking to delay retaliation \ncannot be made a principle of strategy without qualification. A slow \nbut tough retaliation may leave the initiating firm worse off than a \nquick but less effective one. Thus to the extent that there is a trade-\noff between the lag in retaliation and the effectiveness and toughness \nof that retaliation, the firm will have to balance the two in selecting a \nmove. \nDEFENSIVE MOVES \nThus far we have been talking about offensive moves, but the \nneed to deter or defend against moves by competitors can be equally \nimportant. The problem of defense, of course, is the opposite of the \nproblem of offense. Good defense is creating a situation in which \ncompetitors, after doing the analysis described above or actually at-\ntempting a move, will conclude that the move is unwise. As with of-\nfensive moves, defense can be achieved by forcing competitors to \nback down after a battle.

Some approaches to achieving this effect have been \ndiscussed and others will be introduced as part of the generalized \nconcept of creating commitment, discussed below. \nEven if a move cannot be prevented, however, there are some \nother approaches to defense, \nDISCIPLINE AS A FORM OF DEFENSE \nIf a competitor makes a move and the firm immediately and \nsurely retailiates against it, this disciplining action can lead the ag-\ngressor to expect that retaliation will always occur. The more the dis-\nciplining firm is able to aim its retaliation specifically at the initiator, \nand the more it can communicate that its target is the initiator rather \nthan any other firm, the more effective such discipline is likely to be. \nFor example, a fighting brand which is a copy of a particular com-\npetitor's product is more effective discipline than a more generalized \nnew product.5 Conversely, if the retaliation must be generalized \n(e.g., a price cut that applies to all customers and not just those \nshared with the initiating price cutter), the more expensive and less \neffective the discipline is likely to be. Also, when the response to a \nmove must be generalized rather than focused on the firm initiating \nthe battle, retaliation runs a greater risk of starting a chain reaction \nof moves and countermoves—which makes discipline more risky. \nDENYING A BASE \nOnce a competitor's move has occurred, the denial of an ade-\nquate base for the competitor to meet its goals, coupled with the ex-\npectation that this state of affairs will continue, can cause the com-\npetitor to withdraw. New entrants, for example, usually have some \ntargets for growth, market share, and ROI, and some time horizon \nfor achieving them. If a new entrant is denied its targets and be-\ncomes convinced that it will be a long time before they are met, then \nit may withdraw or deescalate. Tactics for denying a base include \nstrong price competition, heavy expenditures on research, and so on. \nAttacking new products in the test-market phase can be an effective \nway to foretell a firm's future willingness to fight and can be less ex-\npensive than waiting for the introduction to actually occur.

It can be worth paying a substantial short-run \nprice to deny a base if a firm's market position is threatened. Essen-\ntial to such a strategy, however, is a good hypothesis about what a \ncompetitor's performance targets and time horizon are. \nAn example of such a situation may be Gillette's withdrawal \nfrom digital watches. Although claiming it had won significant mar-\nket shares in test markets, Gillette bowed out, citing the substantial \ninvestments required to develop technology and margins lower than \nthose available in other areas of its business. Texas Instruments' \nstrategy of aggressive pricing and rapid technological development \nin digital watches probably had a substantial impact on this decision. \nCommitment \nPerhaps the single most important concept in planning and exe-\ncuting offensive or defensive competitive moves is the concept of \ncommitment. Commitment can guarantee the likelihood, speed, and \nvigor of retaliation to offensive moves and can be the cornerstone of \ndefensive strategy. Commitments influence the way competitors per-\nceive their positions and those of rivals. Establishing commitment is \nessentially a form of communicating the firm's resources and inten-\ntions unequivocally.6 Competitors face uncertainty about a firm's \nintentions and the extent of its resources. Communicating commit-\nment reduces the uncertainty and causes the players to calculate their \nrational strategies from new assumptions, which avoids warfare. For \nexample, if a firm can commit itself unequivocally to vigorously re-\npulsing a given move, its competitors may take this reaction as a cer-\ntainty rather than a probability in formulating their own strategies. \nThey are thus less likely to act in the first place. The trick in com-\npetitive interactions is to stake out commitments in such a way as to \nmaximize the firm's own market position. \n'It should be stressed that the term communication is not used in the literal sense. \nNevertheless, some modes of signaling and establishing commitments are under \nreview by the U.S. antitrust authorities because of the concern that they may be ef-\nfective in leading to tacit collusion in industries.

Thus \ncommitment can deter retaliation. The more entrenched and stub-\nborn the firm appears in its intentions to carry out a move, the more \nlikely this outcome is. If competitors perceive a grim and committed \ncompetitor, they may be convinced that if they retaliate the competi-\ntor will countermove to keep its new position, and so on in a down-\nward spiral. \nThe second form of commitment is analogous, but it relates to a \nfirm's reaction to possible initiatives by competitors. If the firm can \nconvince its rivals that it will retaliate strongly and with certainty to \ntheir moves, they may conclude that it is not worth making the move \nat all. This role of commitment is to deter threatening moves in the \nfirst place. The more competitors perceive the prospect of dogged, \nbitter retaliation to the point of severely hurting everyone's profits, \nthe less likely they are of initiating the chain of events in the first \nplace. This is analogous to the situation in which the robber says, \n\"stick 'em up, I want your money,\" and the deranged-looking vic-\ntim says \"If you take it, I will explode this bomb and kill us both! \" \nThe third form of commitment, that of not taking a damaging \naction, might be termed creating trust. This form of commitment \ncan be important in deescalating competitive battles. For example, if \nthe firm can convince its rivals that it will follow a price increase \nrather than attempt to undercut it, it may help stop a price war. \nThe persuasiveness of a commitment is related to the degree to \nwhich it appears binding and irreversible.

The building \nblocks of a credible commitment are the following: \n• assets, resources, and other mechanisms to carry out the com-\nmitment quickly; \n• a clear intention to carry out the commitment, including a \nhistory of adherance to past commitments; \n• inability to back down or perceived moral resolve not to back \ndown; \n• ability to detect compliance to the terms to which the commit-\nment refers. \nThe necessity of having the mechanisms to carry out a commit-\nment in order to communicate its seriousness is obvious.

The past is usually used by \ncompetitors as an indication of how reliable and tough a firm is like-\nly to be in its reactions, and a well-orchestrated series of past reac-\ntion (which may be on less important or even trivial matters) can be a \npersuasive signal of future intentions. The clear intention to carry \nout a commitment is also enhanced by noticeable actions that reduce \nthe lag in retaliating, like defensive R&D programs already under-\nway which are known to competitors. Announcements or leaks of \nthe intention to carry out a commitment are also communicating de-\nvices, although they do not usually communicate with the serious-\nness of past behavior. \nExtremely effective in communicating commitment are known \nfactors that make it difficult and costly if not impossible for the firm \nto back down. For example, a publicized long-term contract with a \nsupplier or customer is an indication of a long-run stake in trying to \nenter and stay in a market. So is buying a plant rather than leasing it, \nor entering a market as a fully integrated producer rather than just \nan assembler. Commitment to retaliate to a competitor's moves can \nbe made irreversible by written or verbal agreements with retailers or \ncustomers to meet price cuts, guarantees of an equivalent quality \nproduct, cooperative advertising support to meet a competitor's ac-\ntion, and so on. Declaring commitments to the industry or financial \ncommunity in public statements, publicizing targets for market \nshare, and a variety of other devices can let competitors know that a \n",

This knowl-\nedge will tend to deter them from trying to force it to do so. \nPursuing this line of thinking, the more the competitor thinks \nthe firm is bordering on being irrational in pursuing its commitment, \nthe more wary it will be in taking that firm on. Irrationality is com-\nmunicated in competitive situations by such things as past actions, \nlawsuits, and public statements. Behavior that tells competitors the \nfirm is serious can occur in all parts of a business. What is said to \nsuppliers, to customers, to distribution channels, and in public can \ncommunicate more or less seriousness about being in the business or \nabout sticking to a commitment for the long haul. \nIt is important to note that great resources are not always neces-\nsary for commitment to be communicated. The firm with a large \nmarket share or broad product line, for example, will usually have \nconflicting goals in retaliating to some moves, as previously dis-\ncussed. The small firm, however, may have much to gain and little to \nlose by initiating a move or by retaliating to others' moves. A price \ncut the firm initiates may have an enormous impact on the large \ncompetitor, given that competitor's higher volume, for example. Al-\nthough the smaller firm has fewer resources to carry out its threats, \nit can also partially compensate through toughness or irrationality. \nFinally, the ability of a firm to detect compliance is central to \nthe effectiveness of its commitment to retaliate. If a competitor be-\nlieves it can \"cheat\" and go undetected, it may be tempted to do so. \nBut if the firm can demonstrate its ability to know immediately of \nany price shading, quality adjustments, or forthcoming new prod-\nucts, for example, its commitment to retaliate becomes more credi-\nble. Known systems of monitoring sales, talking to customers, and \nfor interviewing distributors are examples of ways to communicate a \nhigh probability of detection. It should be noted that buyers may \nhave the incentive to report secret price cuts even if they do not ac-\ntually occur in order to encourage discounting. This can undermine \nthe stability of a market where information is poor or suppliers can-\nnot verify buyer claims. \nAn evolving competitive battle involving Baxter Travenol Lab-\noratories in intravenous solutions, blood containers, and related dis-\nposable health care products is an interesting example of some of \nthese ideas about commitment.9 Baxter ($800 million), in a strong \nmarket position, faces a challenge from the McGaw division of \nAmerican Hospital Supply Corporation ($1.5 billion), developer of \n'For a description, see \"A Miracle of Sorts,\" Forbes, November 15,1977. \n",

Although the Food and \nDrug Administration had not given its approval to the new compet-\nitive product as of November 1977, Baxter reportedly had already \nbegun to take action to communicate its commitment to resist the en-\ntry. Hospital purchasing agents were reporting increased price com-\npetition. Baxter was reported to be offering large discounts on many \nlines and was going especially hard after McGaw accounts. Baxter \nalso had been spending heavily on research and had engaged in re-\nportedly vicious price cutting when another competitor entered the \nmarket in the early 1970s. Baxter's toughness and resolve in meeting \nthis recent competitive challenge has apparently been well communi-\ncated. \nTRUST AS A COMMITMENT \nOur discussion has focused on communicating commitment to \nstick with a move or to retaliate, but in some situations firms find it \ndesirable to make commitments to not make a damaging move or to \nend aggression. Although this course may seem easy, competitors \nare usually wary of a firm's conciliatory gesture, especially if they \nhave been stung by that firm in the past. They may also be wary if \nletting down their guard gives the initiating firm a chance of getting \na jump on them that is hard to recoup.

A persuasive way to communicate trustworthiness is \nfor the firm to demonstrably take some diminution in its perform-\nance that accrues to the benefit of competitors. For example, there is \nsubstantial evidence that General Electric yielded market share in \ncyclical downturns in the turbine generator business to avoid severe \nprice deterioration and took the share back in cyclical upturns.10 \nFocal Points \nA problem leading to instability in oligopoly is in coordinating \nthe expectations of competitors about what the eventual market out-\ncome will be.

Thomas Schelling's work on game theory\" sug-\ngests that an important part of reaching an outcome in such a setting \nis the discovery of a focal point, or some prominent resting place on \nwhich the competitive process can converge its expectations. The \npower of focal points resides in the need and desire of competitors to \nmutually achieve some stable outcome to avoid difficult and unset-\ntling moves and countermoves. Focal points can take the form of \nlogical price points, percentage markup pricing rules, round-number \ndivisions of market shares, informal Sharings of the market on some \ngeographic or customer basis, and so on. The theory of focal points \nis that competitive adjustments will finally settle on such a point, \nwhich then serves as a natural sticking place. \nThe concept of focal points raises three implications for com-\npetitive rivalry. First, firms should seek to identify a desirable focal \npoint as early as possible. The faster the focal point can be reached, \nthe less the costs of jockeying around searching for it are likely to be. \nSecond, industry prices or other decision variables may be simplified \nso that a focal point can be identified. This may involve, for exam-\nple, establishing standard grades or products to replace a complex \narray of items in the line. Third, it is in the firm's interest to try to set \nup the game to make the focal point that is best for it seem to \nemerge. This may mean introducing a terminology in the industry \nthat leads to a desirable focal point, such as talking in terms of prices \nper square foot rather than in terms of absolute prices. It can also \ntake the form of structuring the sequence of strategic moves in such \na way as to make a satisfactory focal point (from the firm's prospec-\ntive) appear to emerge naturally. \nA Note on Information and Secrecy \nIn part because of the proliferation of the business press and in-\ncreased requirements for public filings, companies are disclosing \nmore and more about themselves. Although some of this is legally \nrequired, much of what is written in annual reports, stated in inter-\nviews or speeches, or comes out via other means is not statutorily re-\nquired. Disclosure may stem more from concern with the stock mar-\nSchelling(1960). \n",

Chapter 1 has examined some of the structural conditions \nthat make an industry's buyer group as a whole more or less powerful. \nYet it is rare that the buyer group facing an industry is homoge-\nneous from a structural standpoint. Many producer-goods indus-\ntries, for example, sell products to firms in a wide variety of busi-\nnesses that use the product in differing ways. These firms can differ \nwidely in their volumes of purchases, the importance of the product \nas an input to their production processes, and so on. Buyers of con-\nsumer goods can also vary a great deal in the quantity of a product \nthey purchase, in income, in education, and along many other di-\nmensions. \nAn industry's buyers can also differ in their purchasing needs. \nDifferent buyers may require differing levels of customer service, de-\nsired product quality or durability, needed information in sales pre-\nsentations, and so on. These differing purchasing needs are one rea-\nson why buyers have different structural bargaining power. \nBuyers differ not only in their structural position but also in \ntheir growth potential, and hence in the probable growth of their \nvolume of purchases. Selling an electronic component to a firm like \nDigital Equipment in the rapidly growing minicomputer industry of-\nfers greater prospects for growth than selling the same component to \na black and white television manufacturer. \nFinally, for a variety of reasons the costs of servicing individual \nbuyers differ. In electronic component distribution, for example, \nservicing buyers who order components in small quantities is a great \ndeal more costly (as a percentage of sales) than serving higher-vol-\nume purchasers because the costs of servicing an order are largely \nfixed with respect to quantity shipped. The primary costs are paper-\nwork, processing, and handling, which are not greatly affected by \nthe number of components involved. \nAs a result of this heterogeneity, buyer selection—the choice of \ntarget buyers—becomes an important strategic variable. Broadly \nspeaking, the firm should sell to the most favorable buyers possible, \nto the extent it has any choice. Buyer selection can strongly affect the \ngrowth rate of the firm and can minimize the disruptive power of \nbuyers. Buyer selection with attention to structural considerations is \nan especially important strategic variable in mature industries and in \nthose where barriers caused by product differentiation or technolog-\nical innovation are hard to sustain. \nSome concepts for buyer selection will be developed below.

One \nsuch key implication is that a firm can not only find good buyers but \nalso can create them. \nA FRAMEWORK FOR BUYER SELECTION AND STRATEGY \nThere are four broad criteria, drawn from the previous discus-\nsion, that determine the quality of buyers from a strategic stand-\npoint: \n• Purchasing needs versus company capabilities \n• Growth potential \nintrinsic bargaining power \npropensity to exercise this bargaining \n• Cost of servicing \npower in demanding low prices \nBuyers' different purchasing needs carry strategic implications \nif a firm has differing capabilities for serving these needs relative to \ncompetitors. The firm will improve its competitive advantage, other \nthings being equal, if it targets its efforts toward buyers whose par-\nticular needs it is in the best relative position to serve. The signifi-\ncance of the growth potential of buyers for strategy formulation is \nself-evident. The higher the growth potential of a buyer, the more \nprobably its demands for the firm's product will be increasing over \ntime. \nBuyers' structural position is usefully divided into two parts for \npurposes of strategic analysis. Intrinsic bargaining power is the lever-\nage the buyers can potentially exert over sellers, given their clout and \nthe alternative sources of supply available. This leverage may or may \nnot be exercised, however, because buyers also differ in their pro-\npensity to exercise their bargaining power to force down a seller's \nmargins. Some buyers, even though they may purchase large quanti-\nties, are not particularly price sensitive. Or they are willing to trade \nprice against other product attributes in a way that preserves the \nmargins of the sellers. Both intrinsic bargaining power and the pro-\npensity to exercise it are crucial strategically, because unexercised \npower is a threat that can be unleashed by industry evolution. Buyers \nwho have not been price sensitive can rapidly become so as their in-\ndustries mature, for example, or as some substitute product begins \nto put pressure on their own margins. \n",

If these costs are \nhigh, then buyers that are \"good buyers\" based on other criteria \nmay lose their attraction, because the costs more than offset any \nhigher margins or lower risks in serving them. \nThese four criteria do not necessarily all move in the same direc-\ntion. The buyers with the greatest growth potential can also be the \nmost powerful and/or the most ruthless in exercising their power, \nthough not necessarily. Or the buyers with little bargaining power \nand low price sensitivity may be so costly to service that the benefits \nof higher realized prices may be outweighed. Finally, the buyers the \nfirm is best suited to serve may fail all the other tests. Thus the ulti-\nmate choice of the best target buyers is often a weighing and balanc-\ning process among these factors, measured against the firm's goals. \nTo assess where a particular buyer falls with respect to the four \ncriteria is a matter of applying the concepts of structural and com-\npetitor analysis to their situations. Some of these factors will now be \ndiscussed. \nPURCHASING NEEDS RELATIVE TO A FIRM'S CAPABILITIES \nThe need to match buyers' particular purchasing needs with the \nrelative capabilities of the firm is self-evident. Such a match will al-\nlow the firm to achieve the highest level of product differentiation \nvis-à-vis its buyers compared to competitors. It should also minimize \nthe cost of serving these buyers relative to competitors. For example, \nif the firm has strong engineering and product development skills it \nwill achieve the greatest relative advantage in serving the buyers who \nplace greatest stress on custom varieties. Or if the firm enjoys an ef-\nficient logistical system relative to its competitors, this advantage \nwill be maximized by serving the buyers for whom cost is crucial or \nfor whom the logistics of reaching them are most complex. \nDiagnosing the purchasing needs of particular buyers is a mat-\nter of identifying all the factors that enter into each buyer's purchase \ndecision and the factors involved in executing the purchase transac-\ntion (shipping, delivery, order processing). These can then be ranked \nfor individual buyers or buyer groups within the total buyer popula-\ntion.

The \nbroad factors determining long-run industry growth are described in \nChapter 8, \"Industry Evolution.\" \nSome market segments within an industry will usually be grow-\ning faster than others. Thus the buyer's growth potential also de-\npends in part on what segments it is primarily serving or those it \ncould and will potentially serve. Assessing the growth potential of \nparticular segments requires basically the same analysis as assessing \nthe growth potential of the industry, although at a lower level of ag-\ngregation. \nThe market share of a buyer in its industry and in particular \nmarket segments is the third element in growth analysis. Both the \nbuyer's current share and the likelihood that this share will move up \nor down is a function of the buyer's competitive situation. Assessing \nthis state requires a competitor analysis as well as a diagnosis of \npresent and future industry structure, as is outlined in other chap-\nters. \nAll three of these elements jointly determine the growth poten-\ntial of the buyer.

The vol-\nume of purchases of a particular buyer will be most significant in \ngiving it bargaining leverage when the seller has high fixed costs. \nThey lack qualified alternative sources. If the particular buyers' \nneeds are such that there are few alternative products that will meet \nthem satisfactorily, their bargaining leverage is limited. For exam-\nple, if the buyer needs an unusually high-precision part because of \nthe design of the final product, there may be few sellers that can sup-\nply it. A good buyer, using this criterion, is one who has a need for \nfeatures of the particular seller's product or service that are unique. \nQualified alternative sources can also be limited by needs for exten-\nsive testing or field trials to insure seller compliance with needed \nspecifications, such as is common in telecommunications equipment. \nThey face high shopping, transactions, or negotiating costs. \nBuyers who face particular difficulties in securing alternative quotes, \nnegotiating, or conducting transactions generally have less intrinsic \npower.

Buyers who are not price sensitive at all, or who are \nwilling to trade price for performance characteristics of the product, \nare usually good buyers. Once again the conditions determining the \nprice sensitivity of individual buyers are similar to those determining \nthe price sensitivity of the buyer group as a whole, presented in \nChapter 1, with a number of extensions. \nBuyers who are not sensitive to price tend to fall into one or \nmore of the following categories: \nThe cost of the product is a small part of the cost of the buyer's \nproduct cost and/or purchasing budget. If the product is a relatively \nlow-cost item, the perceived benefits of price shopping and bargain-\ning tend to be low. Note that the relevant cost is the total cost of the \nproduct per period, not the unit cost. Unit costs may be low, but the \nnumber of units purchased may make the item very important. The \nefforts of the consumer or purchasing agent, whichever is applica-\nble, will tend to be directed toward the higher-cost items. For indus-\ntrial buyers, this often means that senior, specialist purchasing \nagents and company executives buy high-cost items, and more jun-\nior, generalist purchasing agents handle all the low-cost items as a \ngroup. For consumer buyers, a low-cost item does not justify the \nhigh costs of shopping and product comparison. As a result, conve-\nnience may be a major motive in purchase, and purchase will be \nbased on less \"objective\" criteria. \nThe penalty for product failure is high relative to its cost. If a \nproduct that fails or does not meet expectations causes the particular \nbuyer to pay a substantial penalty, then the buyer will tend not to be \nprice sensitive. The buyer will be much more concerned about qual-\nity, willing to pay a premium for it, and will tend to stick with prod-\nucts that have proven themselves in the past. A good example of this \nproduct characteristic is found in the electrical products industry. \nHere electrical controls sold to buyers for use in production ma-\nchines may encounter lower price sensitivity than controls sold to \nbuyers using them for more mundane applications. Failure of the \ncontrols for a piece of expensive production equipment can idle it as \nwell as a number of workers, if not an entire production line. Prod-\nucts sold to buyers who will use them in interrelated systems may \nalso imply particularly high failure costs, because failure of the \nproduct may bring the whole system down. \nEffectiveness of the product (or service) can yield major savings \nor improvement in performance.

For exam-\nple, an investment banker's or consultant's services can produce ma-\njor savings through accurate pricing of stock issues, valuation of ac-\nquisition candidates or approaches to solving company problems. \nBuyers with particularly difficult pricing decisions, or with high \nstakes in solving problems, will tend to be willing to pay a premium \nfor the very best advice. Another example is provided by the \"log-\nging\" of oil fields. Companies like Schlumberger use sophisticated \nelectronic techniques to detect the probable presence of oil in rock \nformations. Accurate readings can yield major savings in drilling \ncosts, and oil drilling companies happily pay high fees for this serv-\nice, particularly the companies that face very difficult and costly \nwells because of great depth or offshore location. Related to savings \nlike these are savings to the buyer from timely delivery, rapid prod-\nuct servicing in the event of breakdowns, and many others. Some \nbuyers are willing to pay premiums to companies that can perform \nwell in areas such as these. Products that can yield the buyer im-\nprovements in performance include such things as prescription drugs \nand electronic equipment. \nThe buyer competes with a high-quality strategy to which the \npurchased product is perceived to contribute. Those buyers compet-\ning with a high-quality strategy are often quite sensitive about the in-\nputs they purchase. If they perceive that the input enhances the per-\nformance of their product or if the brand of the input carries prestige \nvalue which will reinforce their high-quality strategy, they will tend \nto be insensitive to the price of inputs.

Serving these buyers puts the seller in the worst of situations, \nbecause it elevates costs without elevating margins. \nThe buyer is very profitable and/or can readily pass on the cost \nof inputs. Highly profitable buyers tend to be less price sensitive \nthan those in marginal financial condition, unless the purchased \nproduct is a major cost item. Some of this attitude may be based on \nthe fact that the highly profitable buyers fall into one of the catego-\nries listed above, and part may be attributable to a higher propensity \nto assure the seller a fair return. Although it could be argued that \nhighly profitable buyers are that way because they are good bargain-\ners, in practice it seems that the priorities of such buyers are placed \nless on aggressive bargaining over price and more in other areas. \nThe buyer is poorly informed about the product and/or does \nnot purchase from well-defined specifications. Buyers who are poor-\nly informed about the cost of an input, demand conditions, or crite-\nria on which alternative brands should be evaluated tend to be less \nprice sensitive than very well-informed buyers. If buyers are very \nwell informed about the state of demand and suppliers' costs, on the \nother hand, they can be ruthless price bargainers. This is the case \nwith many large purchasers of commodities. Poorly informed buy-\ners, however, tend to be swayed by subjective factors and to be less \ncertain about squeezing suppliers' margins. However, the buyer must \nnot be so poorly informed as to not recognize that competing prod-\nucts differ. \nThe motivation of the actual decision maker is not narrowly de-\nfined as the cost of inputs. The price sensitivity of the buyer depends \nin part on the motivation of the actual purchaser or decision maker \nin the buyer's organization, which can vary a great deal from buyer \nto buyer. For example, purchasing agents are often rewarded for \ncost savings, which makes them very narrowly price oriented, where-\nas plant managers may have a longer-run outlook based on plant \nproductivity.1 Depending on the size of the company and many other \nfactors, a purchasing agent, plant manager, or even senior executive \nmay be the actual decision maker. In consumer goods, different \nmembers of the family may be the decision maker for different prod-\nucts. Different consumers can have different motivation systems. \nThe more the decision maker's motivation is not narrowly defined as \nminimizing the cost of inputs, the less price sensitive the buyer is \nlikely to be. \n'For a discussion of this point see Corey (1976). \n",

For \nexample, most buyers of Letraset, a high-speed transfer process for \nlettering artwork and drawings, are architects and commercial art-\nists. For them the cost of the lettering is small compared to the cost \nof their time, and attractive lettering reflects strongly on the overall \nimpression left by design work they have done. Architects and artists \nare most concerned with instant availability of a large selection of \ndifferent lettering styles. As a result, buyers of Letraset tend to be \nextremely price insensitive and have allowed Letraset to earn very \nhigh margins. \nThe factors discussed above also mean that large buyers are not \nnecessarily the most price sensitive. For example, large buyers of \nconstruction machinery use their equipment heavily and generally \npurchase a wide line of machines, preferring to deal with one sup-\nplier. A single supplier allows them to take advantage of parts inter-\nchangeability and interacting with a single service organization. \nThey are willing to pay a premium for a reliable line of machines, so \nthat they can be kept intensively utilized, and for products whose \nservice costs are low.

They are much more sensitive about purchase price since \nthe cost of equipment is a major cost item to them. \nCOSTS OF SERVING BUYERS \nThe costs of serving different buyers of a product can vary \ngreatly, usually for one of the following reasons: \n• order size; \n• selling direct versus through distributors; \n• required lead time; \n• steadiness of order flow for purposes of planning and logis-\ntics; \n• shipping cost; \n• selling cost; \n• need for customization or modification; \nMany of the costs of serving buyers can be hidden, and some are \nquite subtle.

Not all firms have the luxury of selecting their buyers, \nand not all industries have buyers that differ significantly along \nthese dimensions. In many cases, however, the option of buyer selec-\ntion is present. \nThe basic strategic principle in buyer selection is to seek out and \nattempt to sell to the most favorable buyers available based on the \ncriteria outlined above. As was noted earlier, the four criteria may \nyield conflicting implications for the attractiveness of a particular \nbuyer. The buyer with the most growth potential may also have the \nmost power and be the most price sensitive, for example. Thus the \nchoice of the best buyer must balance all four criteria against the \ncapabilities of the firm relative to its competitors. \nDifferent firms will be in differing positions to select buyers. A \nfirm with high product differentiation may be able to sell to good \nbuyers that are unavailable to many of its competitors, for example. \nThe intrinsic power of buyers may also vary for different firms. A \nvery large firm or one with unique product variety may be less af-\nfected by the size of the buyer than a smaller firm, to cite just one \npossibility. Finally, firms have differing capabilities with respect to \nserving particular buyers' needs. Thus the most favorable buyers to \nsell to will depend on the position of the individual firm in some \nrespects. \nThere are a number of other strategic implications of buyer se-\nlection: \nThe firm with a low-cost position can sell to powerful, price-\nsensitive buyers and still be successful. If a firm is the low-cost pro-\nducer, no matter how powerful or price sensitive the buyer the firm \nwill be able to earn above-average margins for its industry, because \nthe seller can meet the prices of its competitors and still earn better \nreturns than they do. But there is an element of circularity in this \nstatement in some businesses. The seller may sometimes have to sell \nto \"lousy\" buyers if it is to achieve a cost advantage because it needs \nthe volume. \nThe firm without a cost advantage or differentiation must be se-\nlective about its buyers if it desires an above-average return. Without \na cost advantage, the firm must focus its efforts on buyers who are \nless price sensitive if it is to outperform the industry average. This re-\n",

Without a cost advantage, \nbuilding volume for its own sake is self-defeating because it exposes \nthe firm to less and less favorable buyers. This principle reinforces \nthe notion of generic strategies described in Chapter 2. If the firm \ncannot achieve cost leadership, it must be careful not to become \nstuck in the middle by selling to powerful buyers. \nGood buyers can be created (or the quality of buyers improved) \nthrough strategy. Some of the characteristics of buyers that make \nthem favorable can be influenced by the firm. For example, one im-\nportant strategy is to build up switching costs—by persuading the \ncustomer to design the firm's product into his product, by develop-\ning custom varieties, by assistance in training of customer personnel \nto use the firm's product, and so on. Furthermore, clever selling can \nshift the decision maker for the product from an individual who is \nprice sensitive to one who is less price sensitive. The product or serv-\nice can be improved to yield potential savings to particular types of \nbuyers; and many other actions can be taken to improve the quality \nof the buyer from the firm's point of view, by affecting the charac-\nteristics of good buyers previously identified. \nThis analysis suggests that one way in which the formulation of \nstrategy can be viewed is to create favorable buyers. It is obviously \nbetter, as a matter of strategy, to create good buyers that are locked \ninto the particular firm rather than to create ones that will be good \nbuyers for any competitor. \nThe basis of buyers' choice can be broadened. An approach to \ncreating good buyers which is so important as to warrant separate \ndiscussion is broadening the basis of buyers' choice. Ideally, the \nbasis can be shifted away from purchase price and in directions \nwhere the firm has some distinctive abilities or where switching costs \ncan be created. \nThere are two fundamental ways to broaden buyers' choice. \nThe first is to increase the value added the firm provides to the \nbuyer,2 which involves such tactics as \n• providing responsive customer service; \n• providing engineering assistance; \n• providing credit or rapid delivery; \n• creating new features of the product. \nTheodore Levitt would term this selling the buyer an \"augmented\" product; see \nLevitt (1969). \n",

It may allow the transfor-\nmation of a product which is a commodity itself to one that can be \ndifferentiated. \nA distinct but related way to broaden the basis of buyers' choice \nis to redefine the way the buyer thinks about the product's function, \neven if the product and service offering itself is the same. Here the \nbuyer is shown that the cost or value of the product to him is not \nonly the initial purchase price but involves such additional factors \nas3 \n• resale value; \n• maintenance cost and downtime over the product's life; \n• fuel cost; \n• revenue generating capacity; \n• cost of installation or attachment. \nIf the buyer can be convinced that such factors as these enter into the \nactual total cost or value of the product, then the firm has the poten-\ntial opportunity of demonstrating that its product has superior per-\nformance along these dimensions and thereby justifies a price premi-\num and buyer loyalty. Of course, the firm must be able to deliver on \nits promises of superiority, and its claims must be to some extent dis-\ntinctive vis-à-vis its competitors or the potential higher margins will \nsoon be eroded. Widening the basis of buyers' choice requires a com-\nbination of effective marketing on this basis and product develop-\nment that supports the story convincingly. General Electric has prac-\nticed this strategy very successfully for decades in the large turbine \ngenerator industry. \nHigh-cost buyers can be eliminated. A commonly used strategy \nto boost return on investment is to eliminate the high-cost buyers \nfrom the customer base. This tactic can often be quite effective since \nthere is a common tendency to proliferate marginal customers, par-\nticularly in the growth phase of an industry's development. Elimi-\nnating high cost buyers is also often fruitful since the costs of serving \nindividual buyers are rarely studied.

Or high-cost buyers may offer significant con-\ntributions to a firm's growth which can be essential in reaping \neconomies of scale or necessary for other strategic purposes. Thus a \ndecision to eliminate high-cost customers should involve a study of \nall four elements of buyer attractiveness. \nThe quality of buyers can change over time. Many of the factors \ndetermining a buyer's quality can change. As an industry matures, \nfor example, buyers tend to become more price sensitive in many \nbusinesses because their own margins are squeezed and they are \nmore expert purchasers. From a strategic standpoint, then, it is im-\nportant not to base a strategy on selling to buyers whose quality will \nerode. Conversely, early recognition of a buyer group that is likely \nto become particularly favorable represents a major strategic oppor-\ntunity. Penetrating such buyers early may be easy if they have low \nswitching costs and few other competitors are interested. Once in the \ndoor, switching costs can be elevated through strategy. \nSwitching costs should be considered in making strategic moves. \nIn view of the potential importance of switching costs, the impact of \nall strategic moves on switching costs should be considered. For ex-\nample, the presence of switching costs means that it is often much \ncheaper for a customer to upgrade or augment an already purchased \nproduct then replace it altogether with another brand. This consider-\nation may allow the firm with units already in place to earn very high \nmargins on upgrading, as long as upgrading is priced properly in re-\nlation to the cost of competitors' new units. \nPurchasing Strategy \nThe analysis of suppliers' power in Chapter 1 coupled with a re-\nverse application of the principles of buyer selection can help a firm \nin formulating purchasing strategy. Although there are many aspects \nof purchasing strategy, procedures, and organization that go well \nbeyond the scope of this book, some issues can be usefully examined \nby using the industry structure framework. Key issues in purchasing \nstrategy from a structural standpoint are as follows: \n• stability and competitiveness of the supplier pool; \n• optimal degree of vertical integration; \n",

This factor insures that the firm \nwill purchase inputs of adequate or superior quality/cost to insure \nits own competitiveness. Similarly, selecting suppliers who will con-\ntinue to be able to meet the firm's needs will minimize the costs of \nchanging suppliers. Structural and competitor analysis, discussed \nthroughout this book, can be used to identify how a firm's suppliers \nwill fare along these dimensions. \nThe second issue, vertical integration, will be postponed until \nChapter 14, which examines the strategic considerations in decisions \nto integrate vertically. Here I assume that the firm has decided what \nitems to purchase outside, and the question is how to purchase them \nso as to create the best structural bargaining position. \nIn allocating purchases among suppliers and creating bargain-\ning power, the third and fourth issues, we can turn to structural anal-\nysis. In Chapter 1, the following conditions were identified as lead-\ning to powerful suppliers of a particular input: \n• concentration of suppliers; \n• lack of dependence on the customer for a substantial fraction \nof sales; \n• switching costs facing the customer; \n• a unique or differentiated product (few alternative sources); \n• threat of forward integration. \nThe analysis of buyer selection earlier in this chapter added a num-\nber of other conditions in which the supplier will hold the power vis-\nà-vis the buyer: \n• buyer lacks a credible threat of backward integration; \n• buyer faces high information, shopping, or negotiating costs. \nIn purchasing, then, the goal is to find mechanisms to offset or \nsurmount these sources of suppliers' power. In some cases this \npower is built into industry economics and is out of the firm's con-\ntrol. In many cases, however, it can be mitigated by strategy. \nSpread Purchases.

The business given to each individual supplier must be \nlarge enough to cause the supplier concern over losing it—spreading \npurchases too widely does not take advantage of structural bargain-\ning position. However, purchasing everything from one supplier \nmay yield that supplier too much of an opportunity to exercise \npower or build switching costs. Cutting across these considerations \nis the purchaser's ability to negotiate volume discounts, which is \npartly a matter of bargaining power and partly a matter of supplier \neconomics. Balancing these factors, the purchaser should seek to \ncreate as much supplier dependence on its business as possible and \nreap the maximum volume discounts without exposing itself to too \ngreat a risk of falling prey to switching costs. \nAvoid Switching Costs. Good purchasing strategy, from a \nstructural standpoint, involves the avoidance of switching costs. The \ncommon sources of switching costs have been identified earlier, and \nother subtle areas exist as well. Avoiding switching costs means \nresisting the temptation to become too dependent on a supplier for \nengineering assistance; insuring that employees are not coopted; \navoiding suppliers' efforts to create a custom-variety or custom-en-\ngineered application without a clear cost justification that outweighs \npossible future exercise of leverage; and so on. This policy may in-\nvolve deliberately requiring that an alternate supplier's product is \nused some of the time, disapproving investments in ancillary equip-\nment that are tied to a particular supplier, and resisting supplier \nproducts that involve specialized training procedures for employees, \namong other things. \nHelp Qualify Alternate Sources. It may be necessary to en-\ncourage alternate sources to enter the business, through funding de-\nvelopment contracts and contracts for a small part of purchases. \nSome purchasers have actually helped capitalize new sources or gone \noverseas to persuade foreign firms to come into the business. It may \nalso be desirable to help new suppliers minimize their costs of be-\ncoming qualified sources. Mechanisms range from extreme atten-\ntiveness to finding new suppliers by the purchasing staff to subsidiz-\ning the cost of testing new suppliers' products. \nPromote Standardization.

When the volume of purchases \nallow it, a great deal of bargaining leverage can be gained through \ntapered integration, or partial integration into a particular item \nwhile buying some or even the majority of it from outside suppliers. \nThis process was briefly discussed in Chapter 1 and will be examined \nfurther in Chapter 14. \nThe objective of all these approaches is obviously to lower the \ntotal long-run costs of purchasing.

Second, any additional costs created by such a purchas-\ning strategy must be weighed against its long-run benefits in mitigat-\ning suppliers' bargaining power.

An industry could have only one strategic group if all the \nfirms followed essentially the same strategy. At the other extreme, \neach firm could be a different strategic group. Usually, however, \nthere are a small number of strategic groups which capture the essen-\ntial strategic differences among firms in the industry.

Another group consists of specialist producers like Maytag fo-\ncusing on the high-quality, high-price segment with selective distri-\nbution. Another group (like Roper and Design and Manufacturing) \nproduces unadvertised products for private label. One or two addi-\ntional groups might be identified as well. \nNote that for purposes of defining strategic groups, the strategic \ndimensions must include the firm's relationship to its parent. In an \nindustry like ammonium fertilizer, for example, some firms are divi-\nsions of oil companies, some are divisions of chemical companies, \nsome are parts of farmers' cooperatives, and the rest are indepen-\ndents. Each of these different types of firms is managed with some-\nwhat differing objectives. Often relationships to the parent also \ntranslate into differences in the other dimensions of strategy—for \nexample, all the divisions of oil companies in nitrogen fertilizer have \nquite similar strategies—because the relationship has a lot to do with \nthe resources and other strengths available to the firm and the phi-\nlosophy with which it is operated. The same sorts of arguments ap-\nply to the differing relationships firms may have with their home \nand/or host goverments, which also must be part of defining strate-\ngic groups. \nStrategic groups often differ in their product or marketing ap-\nproach, but not always. Sometimes, as in corn milling and the manu-\nfacture of chemicals or sugar, groups' products are identical but \nmanufacturing, logistics, and vertical integration approaches differ. \nOr firms might be following strategies but have differing relation-\nships to parent companies or host governments that affect their ob-\njectives. Strategic groups are not equivalent to market segments or \nsegmentation strategies but are defined on the basis of a broader \nconception of strategic posture. \nStrategic groups are present for a wide variety of reasons, such \nas firms' differing initial strengths and weaknesses, differing times \nof entry into the business, and historical accidents. (I will have more \nto say on this subject later in this chapter.) However, once groups \nhave formed, the firms in the same strategic group generally resem-\nble one another closely in many ways besides their broad strategies. \nThey tend to have similar market shares and also to be affected by \nand respond similarly to external events or competitive moves in the \nindustry because of their similar strategies.

It is an intermediate frame of reference between \nlooking at the industry as a whole and considering each firm sepa-\nrately. Ultimately every firm is unique, and thus classifying firms \ninto strategic groups inevitably raises questions of judgment about \nwhat degree of strategic difference is important. These judgments \nmust necessarily relate to structural analysis: a difference in strategy \namong firms is important enough to recognize in defining strategic \ngroups if it significantly affects the structural position of the firms. I \nwill return later to these practical considerations of mapping strate-\ngic groups and using the map as an analytical tool. \nIn the rare case of only one strategic group existing in an indus-\ntry, the industry can be analyzed fully by using the techniques of \nstructural analysis presented in Chapter 1.

Differences in strategy may imply differences \nin product differentiation, differences in the achievement of econo-\nmies of scale, differences in capital requirements, and potential dif-\nferences in all the other sources of entry barriers. If barriers caused \nby production economies of scale exist, for example, they will be \nmost significant in protecting the strategic group consisting of firms \nwith large plants and extensive vertical integration. Economies of \nscale in distribution, if they exist in the industry, will create barriers \nto entry into strategic groups with captive distribution organiza-\ntions. Cost advantages from accumulated experience, if they are im-\nportant in the industry, create barriers protecting the groups consist-\ning of experienced firms (although not inexperienced ones). And so \non for each other source of entry barriers. \nDifferences in firms' relations to their parents may affect entry \nbarriers as well. The strategic group including those firms that have \na vertical relationship to their parents, for example, may enjoy supe-\nrior access to raw materials or larger financial resources with which \nto retaliate against potential entrants than a strategic group consist-\ning of independent competitors. Or firms who share distribution \nchannels with another division of their parent company may reap \neconomies of scale that their competitors cannot match, thereby de-\nterring entry. \nThis view that entry barriers depend on the target strategic \ngroup carries another important implication. Entry barriers not only \nprotect firms in a strategic group from entry by firms outside the in-\ndustry but also provide barriers to shifting strategic position from \none strategic group to another. For example, the narrow-line, un-\nbranded appliance assembler described earlier will face many if not \nmost of the same difficulties in entering the strategic group consist-\ning of the broad-line, nationally branded, integrated firms as would \nan entirely new entrant. Factors creating entry barriers that result \nfrom competing with a particular strategy—because they affect \neconomies of scale, product differentiation, switching costs, capital \nrequirements, absolute cost advantages, or access to distribution— \nelevate the cost to other firms of adopting that strategy.

The movement of a firm from a position outside the industry \nto a strategic group in the industry (entry) becomes one of a contin-\nuum of possibilities, using this broader concept of barriers. \nMobility barriers provide the first major reason why some firms \nin an industry will be persistently more profitable than others. Dif-\nferent strategic groups carry with them different levels of mobility \nbarriers, which provide some firms with persistent advantages over \nothers. The firms in strategic groups with high mobility barriers will \nhave greater profit potential than those in groups with lower mobil-\nity barriers. These barriers also provide a rationale for why firms \ncontinue to compete with different strategies despite the fact that all \nstrategies are not equally successful. One asks oneself why successful \nstrategies are not quickly imitated. Without mobility barriers, firms \nwith successful strategies would be quickly imitated by others, and \nfirms' profitability would tend toward equality except for differ-\nences in their abilities to execute the best strategy in an operational \nsense. Without deterrents, for example, computer manufacturers \nlike Control Data and Honeywell would jump at the chance to adopt \nIBM's strategy, with its lower costs and superior service and distri-\nbution network. The existence of mobility barriers means that some \nfirms like IBM can enjoy systematic advantages over others, through \neconomies of scale, absolute cost advantages, and so on, which can \nbe overcome only by strategic breakthroughs that lead to structural \nchange in the industry, and not merely through better execution. Fi-\nnally, the presence of mobility barriers means that market shares of \nfirms in some strategic groups in an industry can be very stable, and \nyet there can be rapid entry and exit (or turnover) in other strategic \ngroups in the industry. \nJust like entry barriers, mobility barriers can change; and as \nthey do (such as if the manufacturing process becomes more capital \nintensive) firms often abandon some strategic groups and jump into \nnew ones, changing the pattern of strategic groups. Mobility barriers \ncan also be influenced by firm choices of strategy. A company in an \nundifferentiated product industry, for example, can attempt to cre-\nate a new strategic group (with higher mobility barriers) by investing \nheavily in advertising to develop brand identification (like Perdue is \ndoing in fresh chicken). Or it can try to introduce a new manufactur-\ning process with greater economies of scale (Castle & Cooke and \nRalston Purina in mushroom farming).5 Investments in building mo-\n3See \"Mushrooming Business,\" Forbes, July 15, 1977. \n",

Diversified firms \ncan also enjoy reductions in mobility barriers because of opportuni-\nties for sharing operations or functions. The implications of these \nfactors for decisions to enter new businesses will be discussed in \nChapter 16. \nAfter mapping the strategic groups in an industry, the second \nstep in structural analysis within an industry is to assess the height \nand composition of the mobility barriers protecting each group. \nMOBILITY BARRIERS AND GROUP FORMATION \nStrategic groups form and change in an industry for a variety of \nreasons. First, firms often begin with or later develop differences in \nskills or resources, and thus select different strategies. The well-situ-\nated firms outdistance others in the race toward the strategic groups \nprotected by high mobility barriers as the industry develops. Secondj \nfirms differ in their goals or risk posture. Some firms may be more \nprone to making risky investments in building mobility barriers than \nothers. Business units that differ in their relationship to a parent \ncompany (e.g., being vertically related, unrelated, or a free-standing \nfirm) may differ in goals in ways that will lead to differences in strat-\negy, as may international competitors with different situations in \ntheir other markets than domestic firms. \nThe historical development of an industry provides another ex-\nplanation for why firms differ in their strategies. In some industries, \nbeing an early entrant provides access to strategies more costly to \nlater entrants. Mobility barriers from scale economies, product dif-\nferentiation, and other causes may also change, either as a result of \nfirm's investments or exogenous causes. Changing mobility barriers \nmean that early entrants into the industry may pursue very different \nstrategies than later entrants, some of which may not be available to \nlater entrants. The irreversibility of many forms of investment deci-\nsions sometimes precludes early entrants from adopting the strate-\ngies of the later entrants who have the advantages of hindsight. \n",

    "chunk_full": "136 \nCOMPETITIVE STRATEGY \nA related point is that the process of historical evolution of an \nindustry tends to lead to the self-selection of different types of en-\ntrants at different times. For example, later entrants into an industry \nmay tend to be firms with increased financial resources who can af-\nford to wait until some of the uncertainties in the industry are re-\nsolved. Firms with few resources, on the other hand, could have \nbeen compelled to enter early when capital costs of entry were low. \nChanges in the structure of the industry can either facilitate the \nformation of new strategic groups or work to homogenize groups. \nFor example, as an industry increases in total size, strategies involv-\ning vertical integration, captive distribution channels, and in-house \nservicing may become increasingly feasible for the aggressive firm, \npromoting the formation of new strategic groups. Similarly, techno-\nlogical changes or changes in buyers' behavior can shift industry \nboundaries, bringing entirely new strategic groups into play.\" Con-\nversely, maturity in an industry, which lessens the buyer's desire for \nservice capability or for the reassurance embodied in the manufac-\nturer having a full product line, can work to reduce the mobility bar-\nriers that accrue to some strategic dimensions, leading to a reduction \nin the number of strategic groups. As a consequence of all these fac-\ntors, we would expect to see the array of strategic groups and the dis-\ntribution of profit rates of firms within an industry change over \ntime. \nSTRATEGIC GROUPS AND BARGAINING POWER \nJust as different strategic groups are protected by differing mo-\nbility barriers, they enjoy differing degrees of bargaining power with \nsuppliers or customers. If we examine the factors leading to the pres-\nence or absence of bargaining power discussed in Chapter 1, it is ap-\nparent that they relate to some extent to the strategy adopted by the \nparticular firm. For example, concerning bargaining power with \nbuyers, Hewlett-Packard (HP) is in a strategic group in electronic \ncalculators emphasizing high quality and technological leadership \nand focusing on the sophisticated user. Although such a strategy \nmay limit HP's potential market share, it does expose it to less price-\nsensitive and less powerful buyers than the firms competing with es-\n\"Technological or buyer changes can increase or decrease product substitutability, \nand hence shift relevant industry boundaries. \n",

Relating this ex-\nample to the terminology of Chapter 1, HP's products are more dif-\nferentiated than those of the mass market competitors, its buyers are \nmore quality-oriented, and the cost of the calculator is smaller rela-\ntive to the buyers' budgets and to the value of the service they want it \nto perform. An example where different strategic groups have dif-\nfering bargaining power with suppliers is the much greater volume of \npurchases and threat of backward integration that large, broad-line, \nnational department store chains like Sears have as bargaining levers \nwith suppliers relative to local, single-unit department stores. \nStrategic groups will have differing amounts of power vis-à-vis \nsuppliers and buyers for two categories of reasons, both illustrated \nin the examples above: Their strategies may yield them differing de-\ngrees of vulnerability to common suppliers or buyers; or their strate-\ngies may involve dealing with different suppliers or buyers with cor-\nrespondingly different levels of bargaining power. The extent to \nwhich relative power can vary depends on the industry; in some in-\ndustries all strategic groups could be in essentially the same position \nwith respect to suppliers and buyers. \nThe third step in structural analysis within an industry, then, is \nto assess the relative bargaining power of each strategic group in the \nindustry with its suppliers and buyers. \nSTRATEGIC GROUPS AND THE THREAT OF SUBSTITUTES \nStrategic groups may also face differing levels of exposure to \ncompetition from substitute products if they are focusing on differ-\nent parts of the product line, serving different customers, operating \nat different levels of quality or technological sophistication, have \ndifferent cost positions, and so on. Such differences may make them \nmore or less vulnerable to substitutes even though the strategic \ngroups are all in the same industry. \nFor example, a minicomputer firm focusing on business cus-\ntomers, selling machines complete with software to perform a wide \nvariety of functions, will be less vulnerable to substitution from mi-\ncrocomputers than a firm primarily selling to industrial buyers for \nrepetitive process-control applications.

Some of the structural features that \ndetermine the strength of competitive rivalry (Chapter 1) may apply \nto all firms in the industry and thus provide the context in which the \nstrategic groups interact. Broadly speaking, however, the existence \nof multiple strategic groups usually means that the forces of compet-\nitive rivalry are not faced equally by all firms in the industry. \nThe first point to be made is that the presence of several strate-\ngic groups will often affect the overall level of rivalry in the industry. \nTheir presence will generally increase rivalry because it implies \ngreater diversity or asymmetry among firms in the industry in the \nsense defined in Chapter 1. Differences in strategy and external cir-\ncumstances mean that firms will have differing preferences about \nrisk taking, time horizon, price levels, quality levels, and so on. \nThese differences will complicate the process of firms understanding \neach others' intentions and reacting to them, and will thus increase \nthe likelihood of repeated outbreaks of warfare. The industry with a \ncomplicated map of strategic groups will tend to be more competi-\ntive as a whole than one with few groups. Recent research has veri-\nfied this point in a number of contexts.5 \nNot all differences in strategy are equally significant in affecting \nindustry rivalry, however, and the process of competitive rivalry is \nnot symmetrical. Some firms are more exposed to damaging price \ncutting and other forms of rivalry from other strategic groups than \nothers. Four factors determine how strongly the strategic groups in \nan industry will interact in competing for customers: \n• the market interdependence among groups, or the extent to \nwhich their customer targets overlap; \n'See Hunt (1972); Newman (1978); Porter (1976, Chaps. 4, 7). \n",

When \nstrategic groups have high market interdependence, differences \nin strategy will lead to the most vigorous rivalry, for example, in fer-\ntilizer where the customer (the farmer) is the same for all groups. \nWhen strategic groups are targeting very different segments, their \ninterest in and effect on each other is much less severe. As the cus-\ntomers they are selling to become more distinguished, the rivalry be-\ncomes more (but not the same) as if the groups were in different in-\ndustries. \nThe second key factor influencing rivalry is the degree of prod-\nuct differentiation created by the groups' strategies.

In ammonium fertilizer, as an instance, oil company partic-\nipants, chemical company participants, cooperatives, and indepen-\ndents all have very different objectives and constraints.

A number of factors are crucial to this standing. First, \nthe degree of competition within the group is important because \nfirms in the group may compete away potential profits among \nthemselves. This effect is more likely to occur if there are many firms \nin the strategic group. \nSecond, all firms following the same strategy are not necessarily \nequally positioned from a structural standpoint. Specifically, a \nfirm's structural position may be affected by its scale relative to \nothers in its strategic group. If there are any economies of scale oper-\nating that are large enough so that costs are still declining in the \nrange of market shares held by firms in the group, then the firms \nthat have relatively small shares will have lower profit potential. For \nexample, although Ford and GM have relatively similar strategies \n° and could be classified in the same strategic group, GM's greater \nscale allows it to reap some of the economies inherent in the strategy \nthat Ford cannot, such as in research and development and model \nchangeover costs. Firms like Ford have overcome scale-related mo-\nbility barriers and gotten into the strategic group, but they still face \nsome cost disadvantages relative to a larger firm in the group. \nThe firm's position in its strategic group also depends on its cost \nof entering the group. The skills and resources available to the firm \nin entering a group may give it an advantage or disadvantage relative \nto others in the group. Some of these skills or resources for entry are \nbased on the firm's position in other industries or its previous suc-\ncess in other strategic groups in the same industry. For example, \nJohn Deere could get into almost any strategic group in the construc-\ntion equipment industry more cheaply than most firms because of its \nstrong position in farm equipment.

In some industries it may be more expensive \nfor late entrants into a strategic group to establish their position \n(e.g., higher cost of establishing an equivalent brand name; higher \ncost of finding good distribution channels because of foreclosure of \nchannels by other firms). Or the situation may be reversed if newer \nentrants can purchase the latest equipment or use new technology. \nDifferences in timing of entry may also translate into differences in \ncumulative experience and hence costs. Thus differences in timing of \nentry may translate into differences in sustainable profitability \namong members of the same strategic group. \nThe final factor entering into the analysis of a firm's position in \nits strategic group is its implementation ability. Not all firms pursu-\ning the same strategy (thus in the same strategic group) will necessar-\nily be equally profitable even if the other conditions that have been \ndescribed are identical. Some firms are superior in their ability to or-\nganize and manage operations, develop creative advertising themes \nwith equal budgets, make technological breakthroughs with the \nsame expenditures on R&D, and so on. These sorts of skills are not \nstructural advantages of the sort created by mobility barriers and the \nother factors discussed above, but they may well be relatively stable \nadvantages. The firms that have superior implementation ability will \nbe more profitable than other firms in the strategic group. \nThis cascading array of factors jointly determine the profit \nprospects of the individual firm, and at the same time, its prospects \nfor market share. The firm will be most profitable if it is in a favor-\nable industry, a favorable strategic group within that industry, and \nhas a strong position in its group. New entrants do not eliminate the \nattractiveness of the industry because of entry barriers; the attrac-\ntiveness of a strategic group is preserved by mobility barriers. The \nstrength of a firm's position in its group is the result of its history \nand the skills and resources available to it. \nThis analysis makes it clear that there are many different kinds \nof potentially profitable strategies.

Although cost \nis one approach to developing barriers, it should be clear that there \nare many others. \nIn view of the interacting nature of the considerations determin-\ning firm profitability, the profit potential of a firm is strongly af-\nfected by the competitive outcome in those strategic groups that are \nmarket interdependent and have higher mobility barriers. The strate-\ngic groups with higher mobility barriers have greater profit potential \nthan the less protected groups if competition within them is not too \ngreat. However, if competition within them is fierce for some reason \nand their prices and profits are thereby lowered, it can also destroy \nthe profitability of the firms in the interdependent groups less pro-\ntected by mobility barriers. Lower prices (or higher costs through \nadvertising and other forms of non-price competition) spill over via \nmarket interdependence so that less protected groups must respond, \ndriving down their own profits. This is a risk that must be assessed in \nchoosing a strategic group. \nA good example of this process is seen in the soft drink indus-\ntry. If Coke and Pepsi get into a price war or advertising battle, their \nprofits are diminished, but not nearly so much as those of the region-\nal and local brands who inevitably are affected because their produc-\ners are competing for the same customers. Competition among \nCoke, Pepsi, and the other major brands, protected by substantial \nmobility barriers, lowers the profit umbrella over the regional and \nlocal brands. They tend to lose not only profits but relative share. \nARE LARGE FIRMS MORE PROFITABLE THAN \nSMALL FIRMS? \nThere has been much recent discussion about strategy arguing \nthat the firm with the largest market share will be the most profit-\nable.6 The previous analysis suggests that whether this is true or not \ndepends on the circumstances. If large firms in an industry compete \nin strategic groups that are more protected by mobility barriers than \nsmaller firms, in stronger positions relative to customers and suppli-\ners, more insulated from rivalry with other groups, and so on, then \n'See, for example, Buzzell et al.

On \nthe other hand, //economies of scale in production, distribution, or \nother functions are not too great, smaller firms following specialist \nstrategies may be able to achieve higher product differentiation or \ngreater technological progressiveness or superior service in their par-\nticular product niches than larger firms. In such industries, smaller \nfirms may well be more profitable than larger, broader-line firms (as \nin women's clothing and carpets). \nIt is sometimes argued that if firms with small shares are more \nprofitable than those with large shares, it reflects a mistake in indus-\ntry definition. Proponents of the dominant role of market share ar-\ngue that we should define the market more narrowly, in which case \n\"small\" firms will indeed have a larger share of a specialized seg-\nment than does a broad-line firm. But if we use a narrow market def-\ninition, we should also define the market narrowly in industries \nwhere broad-line firms happen to be the most profitable.

This outcome is as we would expect. \nSTRATEGIC GROUPS AND COST POSITION \nAnother comparatively recent phenomenon in thinking on strat-\negy formulation is that cost position is the only sustainable factor on \nwhich to build a competitive strategy.

As described \nmost broadly in Chapter 2, in most industries there are a variety of \nways to create mobility barriers or otherwise build a solid structural \nposition. These different strategies will usually involve differing and \noften conflicting sets of functional policies. A firm attempting to \nachieve the greatest effectiveness at one strategy will rarely also be \nmost effective in serving the needs met by others. Low-cost position \nwithin the strategic group may well be crucial, but low-cost position \noverall is not necessarily important or the only way to compete. \nAchieving low-cost position overall often involves a sacrifice in \nother areas of strategy, like differentiation, technology, or service, \non which other strategic groups are based. \nIt is true, however, that strategic groups competing on bases \nother than low cost must be constantly aware of the differential be-\ntween their costs and those of the overall low-cost strategic groups. \nIf this differential becomes large enough, then customers may be in-\nduced to switch to the lower-cost groups despite a sacrifice in qual-\nity, service, technological progressiveness, or other areas. Relative \ncost position among groups is a key strategic variable in this sense. \n",

    "chunk_full": "150 \nCOMPETITIVE STRATEGY \nIf the key mobility barriers into a firm's strategic group are based, \nfor example, on its broad product line, proprietary technology, or \nabsolute cost advantages due to experience, these sources of mobility \nbarriers define some of the firm's key strengths. Or if the most desir-\nable strategic group in the firm's industry is protected by mobility \nbarriers resting on the achievement of economies of scale through a \ncaptive distribution and service organization, the lack of such a fac-\ntor becomes one of the firm's key weaknesses. Structural analysis \ngives us a framework for systematically identifying a firm's key \nstrengths and weaknesses relative to competitors. These strengths \nand weaknesses are not cast in concrete but can change as industry \nevolution realigns the relative position of strategic groups or as firms \ninnovate or make investments to change their structural position. \nThis framework for viewing strengths and weaknesses illumi-\nnates two fundamentally different types: structural and implementa-\ntional. Structural strengths and weaknesses rest on the underlying \ncharacteristics of industry structure, such as mobility barriers, deter-\nminants of relative bargaining power, and so on. As such they are \nrelatively stable and difficult to overcome. Strengths and weaknesses \nin implementation, based on differences in a firm's ability to execute \nstrategies, rest on people and managerial abilities. As such, they may \nbe more ephemeral, though not necessarily. In any case, it is impor-\ntant to make a distinction between the two in analysis of strategy. \nThe strategic opportunities facing the firm in its industry can \nalso be made more concrete by using these concepts. Opportunities \ncan be divided into a number of categories: \n• create a new strategic group; \n• shift to a more favorably situated strategic group; \n• strengthen the structural position of the existing group or the \nfirm's position in the group; \n• shift to a new group and strengthen that group's structural \nposition. \nPerhaps the class of opportunities with the highest payoff is in \ncreating a new strategic group. Technological changes or evolution \nin the structure of the industry often open up possibilities for entirely \nnew strategic groups. Even without such stimuli, the visionary firm \nmight be able to perceive a new, favorably situated strategic group \nnot perceived by its competitors.

The \nframework identified here should illuminate what to look for in such \na repositioning. \nThe three generic strategies identified in Chapter 2 represent \nthree broad and consistent approaches to successful strategic posi-\ntioning.

This chapter has added a lot more flesh \nand blood to the analysis of the generic strategies. It is clear, based \non this chapter, that the generic strategies rest on creating (in differ-\nent ways) mobility barriers; favorable position with buyers, suppli-\ners, and substitutes; and insulation from rivalry.

The map is a very useful way to \ngraphically display competition in an industry and to see how indus-\ntry changes or how trends might affect it. It is a map of \"strategy \nspace,\" instead of price and volume. \nIn mapping strategic groups, the few strategic variables used as \naxes of the map must be selected by the analyst. In doing so, a num-\nber of principles will prove useful. First, the best strategic variables \nto use as axes are those that determine the key mobility barriers in \nthe industry. For example, in soft drinks the key barriers are brand \nidentification and distribution channels, which thus serve as useful \naxes in a strategic group map. Second, in mapping groups it is im-\nportant to select as axes variables that do not move together. For ex-\nample, if all the firms with high product differentiation also have \nbroad product lines, then both these variables should not serve as \naxes on the map.

A final principle is that an industry can be mapped several \ntimes, using various combinations of strategic dimensions, to help \nthe analyst see the key competitive issues. Mapping is a tool to help \ndiagnose competitive relationships, and there is no necessarily right \napproach. \nHaving constructed a strategic group map of an industry, a \nnumber of analytical steps can be illuminating: \nIdentifying Mobility Barriers. The mobility barriers that pro-\ntect each group from attacks from other groups can be identified. \nFor example, the key barriers protecting the high quality/dealer-ori-\nented group in Figure 7-3 are technology, brand image, and an estab-\nlished network of servicing dealers. The key barriers protecting the \nprivate label group, on the other hand, are economies of scale, expe-\nrience, and to some extent relationships with private label custom-\ners.

A structural analysis like that \ndescribed earlier in this chapter can identify groups whose position is \ntenuous or marginal. These are candidates for exit or for attempts at \nmoving into another group. \nCharting Directions of Strategic Movement. A very important \nuse of the strategic group map is to chart the directions in which \nfirms' strategies are moving and might shift from an industry-wide \npoint of view. This task is most easily done by drawing arrows ema-\nnating from each strategic group that represent the direction in \nwhich the group (or a firm in the group) seems to be moving in stra-\ntegic space, if any. Doing this for all groups might show that firms \nare moving apart strategically, which can be stabilizing to industry \ncompetition, particularly if it involves increasing separation of the \ntarget market segments served. Or such an exercise might show that \nstrategic positions are converging, which can be very volatile. \nAnalyzing Trends. It can be illuminating to think through the \nimplications of each industry trend for the strategic group map. Is \nthe trend closing off the viability of some groups? Where will firms \nin that group shift? Is the trend elevating the barriers held by some \ngroups? Will the trend reduce the ability of groups to separate them-\n",

Industry changes will carry \nstrategic significance if they promise to affect the underlying sources \nof the five competitive forces; otherwise changes are important only \nin a tactical sense. The simplest approach to analyzing evolution is to \nask the following question: Are there any changes occuring in the in-\ndustry that will affect each element of structure? For example, do \nany of the industry trends imply an increase or decrease in mobility \nbarriers? An increase or decrease in the relative power of buyers or \nsuppliers? If this question is asked in a disciplined way for each com-\npetitive force and the economic causes underlying it, a profile of the \nsignificant issues in the evolution of an industry will result. \nAlthough this industry-specific approach is the place to start, it \nmay not be sufficient, because it is not always clear what industry \nchanges are occurring currently, much less which changes might oc-\ncur in the future. Given the importance of being able to predict evo-\nlution, it is desirable to have some analytical techniques which will \naid in anticipating the pattern of industry changes that we might ex-\npect to occur. \nPRODUCT LIFE CYCLE \nThe grandfather of concepts for predicting the probable course \nof industry evolution is the familiar product life cycle. The hypothe-\nsis is that an industry1 passes through a number of phases or stages-\nintroduction, growth, maturity, and decline—illustrated in Figure \n8-1. These stages are defined by inflection points in the rate of \ngrowth of industry sales. Industry growth follows an S-shaped curve \nThere is some controversy about whether the life cycle applies only to individual \nproducts or to whole industries. The view that it applies to industries is summa-\nrized here. \n",

Rapid growth occurs as many buyers rush into the market \nonce the product has proven itself successful. Penetration of the \nproduct's potential buyers is eventually reached, causing the rapid \ngrowth to stop and to level off to the underlying rate of growth of \nthe relevant buyer group. Finally, growth will eventually taper off as \nnew substitute products appear. \nAs the industry goes through its life cycle, the nature of compe-\ntition will shift. I have summarized in Figure 8-2 the most common \npredictions about how an industry will change over the life cycle and \nhow this should affect strategy. \nThe product life cycle has attracted some legitimate criticism: \n1. The duration of the stages varies widely from industry to in-\ndustry, and it is often not clear what stage of the life cycle an indus-\ntry is in. This problem diminishes the usefulness of the concept as a \nplanning tool. \n2. Industry growth does not always go through the S-shaped \npattern at all. Sometimes industries skip maturity, passing straight \nfrom growth to decline. Sometimes industry growth revitalizes after \na period of decline, as has occurred in the motorcycle and bicycle in-\ndustries and recently in the radio broadcasting industry. Some indus-\ntries seem to skip the slow takeoff of the introductory phase alto-\ngether. \nFIGURE 8-1.

Companies can affect the shape of the growth curve through \nproduct innovation and repositioning, extending it in a variety of \nways.3 If a company takes the life cycle as given, it becomes an unde-\nsirable self-fulfilling prophesy. \n4. The nature of competition associated with each stage of the \nlife cycle is different for different industries. For example, some in-\ndustries start out highly concentrated and stay that way. Others, like \nbank cash dispensers, are concentrated for a significant period and \nthen become less so. Still others begin highly fragmented; of these \nsome consolidate (automobiles) and some do not (electronic compo-\nnent distribution).

Like any evolution, industries evolve because some forces \nare in motion that create incentives or pressures for change. These \ncan be called evolutionary processes. \nEvery industry begins with an initial structure—the entry bar-\nriers, buyer and supplier power, and so on which exist when the in-\ndustry comes into existence. This structure is usually (though not al-\nways) a far cry from the configuration the industry will take later in \nits development. The initial structure results from a combination of \nunderlying economic and technical characteristics of the industry, \nthe initial constraints of small industry size, and the skills and re-\nJFor a discussion of these methods, see Levitt (1965). \n",

A particularly vivid current example of this situation is the \nadverse effect of the reduced U.S. birthrate on demand for baby \nproducts of all types, whereas products catering to the 25-to-35-year-\nold age group are currently enjoying the effects of the post-World \nWar II baby boom. Demographics also represent a potential prob-\nlem for the recording and candy industries, which have traditionally \nsold most heavily to the pre-20-year-old age group, which is current-\nly shrinking. \nPart of the effect of demographic changes is caused by income \nelasticity, which refers to the change in a buyer's demand for a prod-\nuct as his/her income rises. For some products (mink golf club \ncovers), demand tends to rise disproportionately with buyers' in-\ncome. For other products, demand rises less than proportionally as \nincomes rise, or even falls. It is important from a strategic point of \nview to identify where an industry's product lies in this spectrum, \nbecause it is critical to forecasting long-run growth as general in-\ncome levels of buyers change both in a firm's home country and in \npotential international markets. Sometimes industries can shift their \nproducts up or down the scale of income elasticity through product \ninnovation, however, so the effects of income elasticity are not nec-\nessarily a foregone conclusion. \nFor industrial products, the effect of demographic changes on \ndemand is based on the life cycle of customer industries. Demo-\ngraphics affect consumers' demand for end products, which filters \nback to affect the industries supplying inputs toward those end prod-\nucts. \nFirms can attempt to cope with adverse demographics by widen-\ning the buyer group for their product through product innovations, \nnew marketing approaches, additional service offerings, and so on. \nThese approaches' can in turn affect industry structure by raising \neconomies of scale, exposing the industry to fundamentally different \nbuyer groups with different bargaining power, and so forth. \nTRENDS IN NEEDS \nDemand for an industry's product is affected by changes in the \nlifestyle, tastes, philosophies, and social conditions of the buyer \npopulation which any society tends to experience over time.

The recent \"back to basics\" \nmovement in education is creating new demand for standardized \nreading and writing tests, to give another example. There have also \nbeen social trends such as an increase in the crime rate, the changing \nrole of women, and increased health consciousness that have in-\ncreased demand for some products (bicycles, day care) and reduced \ndemand for others. \nTrends in needs like these not only directly affect demand but \nalso affect the demand for industrial products indirectly through in-\ntervening industries. Trends in needs affect the demand in particular \nindustry segments as well as total industry demand. Needs may be \nnewly created or just made more intense by social trends. For exam-\nple, property theft has increased quite dramatically in the last twenty \nyears, greatly increasing the demand for security guards, locks, \nsafes, and alarm systems. The rising expected losses due to theft \nhave justified greater spending to prevent it. \nFinally, changes in government regulation can increase or de-\ncrease needs for products. For example, demand for pinball and slot \nmachines is growing as a result of impending and already passed leg-\nislation that legalizes gambling.4 \nCHANGE IN THE RELATIVE POSITION OF SUBSTITUTES \nDemand for a product is affected by the cost and quality, \nbroadly defined, of substitute products. If the cost of a substitute \nfalls in relative terms, or if its ability improves to satisfy the buyer's \nneeds, industry growth will be adversely affected (and vice versa). \nExamples are the inroads that television and radio have made on the \ndemand for live concerts by symphony orchestras and other perform-\ning groups; the growth in demand for magazine advertising space as \ntelevision advertising rates climb sharply and prime advertising tele-\nvision time becomes increasingly scarce; and the depressing effect of \nrising prices on the demand of such products as chocolate candy and \nsoft drinks relative to their substitutes. \nIn predicting long-run change in growth, a firm must identify \nall the substitute products that can meet the needs its product satis-\nfies.

For example, in many areas \nof the United States mobile homes are primarily sited in mobile \nhome parks. In the last decade there has been a chronic shortage of \nthese parks, which has limited demand for mobile homes. Similarly, \ndemand for stereophonic records was strongly affected by the avail-\nability of stereophonic audio equipment, which in turn was affected \nby the cost and reliability of this equipment. \nJust as it is important to identify substitutes for an industry's \nproduct it is important to identify complements comprehensively. \nComplementary products should be viewed broadly. For example, \ncredit at prevailing interest rates is a complementary product to pur-\nchases of durable goods. Specialized personnel are a complemeritary \nproduct to many technically oriented goods (e.g., computer pro-\ngrammers to computers and mining engineers to coal mining). \nCharting trends in cost, availability, and quality of complementary \nproducts will yield predictions about long-run growth for an indus-\ntry's product. \nPENETRATION OF THE CUSTOMER GROUP \nMost very high industry growth rates are the result of increasing \npenetration, or sales to new customers rather than to repeat custom-\ners. Eventually, however, it is a fact of life that an industry must \nreach essentially complete penetration. Its growth rate is then deter-\nmined by replacement demand. Renewed periods of adding new cus-\ntomers can sometimes be stimulated by product or marketing \nchanges, which broaden the scope of the customer base or stimulate \nrapid replacement. However, all very high growth rates eventually \ncome to an end. \nOnce penetration is reached the industry is selling primarily to \nrepeat buyers.

The key to achieving industry growth when sell-\ning to repeat buyers is either stimulating rapid replacement of the \nproduct or increasing per capita consumption. Since replacement is \ndetermined by physical, technological, or design obsolescence as per-\nceived by the buyer, strategies to maintain growth after penetration \nwill hinge on affecting these factors. For example, replacement de-\nmand for clothing is stimulated by annual and even seasonal style \nchanges. And the classic story of General Motors' ascendency over \nFord is an example of how model changes stimulated demand after \nmarket saturation for the basic (one color: black) automobile oc-\ncurred. \nWhereas penetration most often means that industry demand \nwill level off, for durable goods, achieving penetration can lead to \nan abrupt drop in industry demand. After most potential customers \nhave purchased the product, its durability implies that few will buy \nreplacements for a number of years. If industry penetration has been \nrapid, this situation may translate into several very lean years for in-\ndustry demand. For example, industry sales of snowmobiles, which \nunderwent very rapid penetration, fell from 425,000 units per year in \nthe peak year (1970-1971) to 125,000 to 200,000 units per year in \n1976-1977.6 Recreational vehicles underwent a similar though not \nquite so dramatic decline. The relation between the growth rate after \npenetration and growth before penetration will be a function of how \nfast penetration has been reached and the average time before re-\nplacement, and this figure can be calculated. \nThe decline in industry sales for durables means that manufac-\nturing and distributing capacity will inherently overshoot demand. \nAs a result, a serious decline in profit margins usually occurs, and \nsome producers may exit. Another characteristic of the demand for \ndurable goods is that growth fueled by penetration can overshadow \ncyclically despite the fact that the product is inherently sensitive to \nthe business cycle. An industry approaching penetration will thus \nhave its first deep cycle, exacerbating the problem of overshooting. \nPRODUCT CHANGE \nThe five external causes of industry growth have presupposed \nno change in the products offered by the industry.

Thus product innovation can improve an industry's circum-\nstances relative to the five external causes of growth, and thereby \nincrease the industry's growth rate. Product innovations have played \na major part in fueling the rapid growth of motorcycles, bicycles, \nand chain saws, for example. \nCHANGES IN BUYER SEGMENTS SERVED \nThe second important evolutionary process is change in the \nbuyer segments served by the industry. For example, early electronic \ncalculators were sold to scientists and engineers, only later to stu-\ndents and bill payers. Light aircraft were initially sold to the military \nand later to private and commercial users. Related to this is the pos-\nsibility that additional segmentation of existing buyer segments can \ntake place by creating different products (broadly defined) and mar-\nketing techniques for them. A final possibility is that certain buyer \nsegments are no longer served < \nThe significance of new buyer segments for industry evolution \nis that the requirements for serving these new buyers (or eliminating \nrequirements for serving obsolete segments) can have a fundamental \nimpact on industry structure. For example, although early buyers of \nthe product may not have required credit and field servicing, later \nbuyers might. If the provision of credit and in-house service creates \npotential economies of scale and raises capital requirements, then \nentry barriers will rise significantly. \nA good example is provided by changes occurring in the optical \ncharacter reader business in the late 1970s. This industry and its \nleader, Recognition Equipment, have been producing large, expen-\nsive optical scanning machines to sort checks, credit cards, and mail. \nEach machine has been custom-made, requiring special engineering \nand produced on a job-shop basis. In recent years, however, small \nwands for use with retail point-of-sale terminals have been devel-\noped. In addition to opening up a vast potential market, the wands \nare amenable to high-volume, standardized manufacturing and will \nbe purchased in large quantities by individual buyers.

Products have a tendency to become more like commodities \nover time as buyers become more sophisticated and purchasing tends \nto be based on better information. Thus there is a natural force re-\nducing product differentiation over time in an industry.

Aerosol packag-\ning first came into use in consumer goods in the 1950s. The package, \nan extremely important part of marketing many consumer goods, \noften represents an important cost item to the marketing company. \nIn the early years of aerosol packaging, consumer marketers were \nunfamiliar with how to design aerosol applications, how aerosol \ncontainers were filled, and how best to market aerosol products.

Products have a tendency to become more like commodities \nover time as buyers become more sophisticated and purchasing tends \nto be based on better information. Thus there is a natural force re-\nducing product differentiation over time in an industry. Learning \nabout the product may lead to increasing demands by buyers for \nwarranty protection, service, improved performance characteristics, \nand so forth. \nAn example is the aerosol packaging industry. Aerosol packag-\ning first came into use in consumer goods in the 1950s. The package, \nan extremely important part of marketing many consumer goods, \noften represents an important cost item to the marketing company. \nIn the early years of aerosol packaging, consumer marketers were \nunfamiliar with how to design aerosol applications, how aerosol \ncontainers were filled, and how best to market aerosol products.

Diffusion occurs through a variety of \nmechanisms. First, firms can learn from physical inspection of com-\npetitors' proprietary products and from information gleaned from a \nvariety of sources about the size, location, organization, and other \ncharacteristics of competitors' operations. Suppliers, distributors, \nand customers are all conduits for such information and often have \nstrong interest in promoting diffusion for their own purposes (e.g., \ncreating another strong supplier). Second, proprietary information \nis also diffused as it becomes embodied in capital goods produced by \noutside suppliers. Unless firms in the industry make their own capi-\ntal goods or protect the information they give to suppliers, the tech-\nnology may become purchasable by competitors. Third, personnel \nturnover increases the number of people who have the proprietary \ninformation and may provide a direct conduit for the information to \nother firms. Spin-off firms founded by technical personnel who have \nleft pioneering companies are common, as is the practice of hiring \naway personnel. Finally, specialized personnel who are expert in the \ntechnology invariably become more numerous from sources such as \nconsulting firms, suppliers, customers, response of university techni-\ncal schools, and so on. \nIn the absence of patent protection, therefore, proprietary ad-\nvantages will tend to erode, as hard as it is for some firms to accept \nthis fact. Thus any mobility barriers built on proprietary knowledge \nor specialized technology tend to erode over time, as do those caused \nby shortages of qualified, specialized personnel. These changes \nmake it easier not only for new competitors to spring up but also for \nsuppliers or customers to vertically integrate into the industry. \nReturning to the previously discussed aerosol example, over \ntime the new aerosol technology became better and better known. \nSince the production volume needed to achieve efficient scale in \naerosol packaging was relatively small, many large consumer mar-\nketing companies could support their own captive filling operations. \n",

This development left \nthe contract filler in the role of meeting emergency demand and in a \nvery adverse bargaining situation. The response of many contract \nfillers was to invest in improving filling technology and to invent \nnew aerosol applications to restore their technological advantage. \nThis strategy proved to be increasingly difficult, and the contract \nfillers' position weakened substantially over time. \nThe rate of diffusion of proprietary technology will depend on \nthe particular industry. The more complex the technology, the more \nspecialized the required technical personnel, the greater the critical \nmass of research personnel required, or the greater the economies of \nscale in the research function, the slower proprietary technology will \ntend to diffuse. When heavy capital requirements and economies of \nscale in R&D confront imitators, proprietary technology can provide \na lasting mobility barrier. \nOne key offsetting force to diffusion of proprietary technology \nis patent protection, which legally inhibits diffusion. However, this \nprotection is unreliable in preventing diffusion since patents can be \nsidestepped by similar inventions. The other offsetting force to dif-\nfusion is the continual creation of new proprietary technology \nthrough research and development. New knowledge will provide \ncompanies with additional periods of proprietary advantages. How-\never, continual innovation may not pay if the diffusion period is \nshort and buyers' loyalties to pioneering firms are not very strong. \nTwo of many possible patterns of mobility barriers arising from \nproprietary technology are illustrated in Figure 8-3. Economies of \nscale in research were initially low in both industries since the initial, \ncrude, breakthrough innovations that created the product could be \nmade by small groups of research personnel. This situation is rela-\ntively common, having occurred in such industries as minicomput-\ners, semiconductors, and others. Proprietary technology provided a \nmodest initial mobility barrier in such an industry, but one that was \nsoon eroded by diffusion. In one industry, the complex technology \nled to increasing economies of scale in the research function. In the \nother, there was little opportunity for continued technological inno-\nvation and hence little need for further research on a significant \nscale. In the first industry, then, mobility barriers from proprietary \ntechnology quickly rose again to a level higher than the initial one. \nEventually they tailed off as opportunities for further innovation \n",

In this in-\ndustry, growth allowed Cessna (the industry leader) to shift its pro-\nduction process from job shop to quasi-mass production.

Increasing industry scale \nalso means that suppliers to the industry are selling it larger volumes \nof goods, and the industry's customers as a group are purchasing \nlarger quantities. To the extent that individual suppliers or buyers \nare increasing their sales or purchases as well, there may be tempta-\ntions for them to begin forward or backward integration into the in-\ndustry. Whether or not integration actually occurs, the bargaining \npower of suppliers or buyers will go up. \nThere may also be a tendency for large industry scale to attract \nnew entrants, who can make it tougher for existing leaders, particu-\nlarly if the entrants are large, established firms. Many large firms \nwill enter a market only after it has reached a significant absolute \nsize (to justify the fixed costs of entry and make a material contribu-\ntion to their overall sales), even though they have been probable po-\ntential entrants right from the industry's birth as a result of skills or \nassets they bring from their existing businesses. For example, in the \nrecreational vehicle industry the initial entrants were new firms \nstarted from scratch and relatively small diversifying mobile home \nproducers whose production process was similar to that of making \nrecreational vehicles.

This rise is squeezing independent producers relative to \nwell-financed movie companies, particularly since movie tax shelters \nhave been circumscribed by 1976 tax legislation. This development \nhas cut a major avenue of financing for independent producers. \nChanges in wage rates or capital costs may change the shape of \nthe industry's cost curve, altering economies of scale or promoting \nsubstitution of capital for labor. Escalating labor costs in service \ncalls and deliveries are fundamentally affecting strategy in many in-\ndustries. Changes in the cost of communication or transportation \ncan promote reorganization of production, which affects entry bar-\nriers. Changes in communication costs may lead to use of different \ncost-effective selling media (and thereby changes in the level of prod-\nuct differentiation), changed distribution arrangements, and so on. \nIn addition, changes in transportation costs can shift geographic \nmarket boundaries, which either increases or decreases the effective \nnumber of competitors in the industry. \nExchange rate fluctuations can also have a profound effect on \nindustry competition. The devaluation of the dollar against the yen \nand many European currencies, for example, has triggered signifi-\ncant shifts in position in many industries since 1971. \nPRODUCT INNOVATION \nA major source of industry structural change is technological \ninnovations of various types and origins.

However, electronic calculators were introduced by \nelectronics companies and not mechanical calculator or slide rule \nproducers. Thus forecasting product innovations involves examining \npossible external sources. Many innovations flow vertically, origi-\nnated by customers and suppliers, where the industry is an important \ncustomer or source of inputs. \nAn example of the influence of product innovation on structure \nis the introduction of the digital watch. Economies of scale in pro-\nducing digital watches are greater than those in producing most con-\nventional watch varieties. Competing in digital watches also requires \nlarge capital investments and an entirely new technological base \ncompared to conventional watches. Thus mobility barriers and other \naspects of the structure of the watch industry are changing rapidly. \nMARKETING INNOVATION \nLike innovations in product, those in marketing can influence \nindustry structure directly through increasing demand. Break-\nthroughs in the use of advertising media, new marketing themes or \nchannels, and so forth can allow reaching new consumers or reduc-\ning price sensitivity (raising product differentiation).

Innova-\ntions that increase scale economies or extend the experience curve \nbeyond the size of national markets can lead to industry globaliza-\ntion (see Chapter 13). \nAn example of the way in which interacting evolutionary proc-\nesses can trigger manufacturing changes is found in changes occur-\nring in the computer service bureau business in 1977. Computer serv-\nice bureaus provide computer power and a library of programs to a \nwide variety of users, including those in business, education, and fi-\nnancial institutions. Traditionally service bureaus have been local or \nregional organizations serving primarily smaller businesses with sim-\nple computer packages in areas like accounting and payroll. How-\never, a substitute product, the minicomputer, has made cheap com-\nputer power easily accessible to even small organizations. As a \nresult, forces have been set in motion which are promoting the devel-\nopment of large regional and national service bureaus. First, more \nsophisticated programs are being developed to differentiate the serv-\nice bureau from the minicomputer, which require substantial invest-\nments. The economies of spreading such investments over a large \nnumber of users are promoting concentration. Second, pressure to \noffer computer power at low cost is putting a premium on efficient \nuse of facilities. This development is adding to the impetus toward \nnational companies to take advantage of time zone changes to make \nuse of off-hours capacity. Third, computer technology continues to \nincrease in complexity, raising technological barriers to establish a \nservice bureau at least in the short run. So all these forces built up in \nthe evolutionary process have led to a change in the manufacturing \nprocess of the leading service bureaus. \nManufacturing innovations that change structure can come \nfrom outside the industry as well as from within. Developments in \ncomputerized machine tools and other manufacturing equipment by \nequipment suppliers, for example, may lead to increased scale econ-\nomies in production in an industry.

As the \nstructure of retailing has become concentrated, the retailers' bar-\ngaining power with their supplying industries has increased.

For example, in the 1950s \nand early 1960s record retailers dropped the policy of allowing con-\nsumers to play records in the store. The effects of this change in the \nadjacent recording industry proved to be profound. Since the con-\nsumer could no longer sample records in the store, what radio sta-\ntions played became critical to record sales. However, because ad-\nvertising rates were becoming increasingly tied to sustained audience \nsize, radio stations were shifting to the \"Top 40\" format, that is, re-\npeatedly playing only the leading songs. It became extremely diffi-\ncult to get a new, unproven record aired on the radio. The change in \nretailing created a powerful new element for the recording indus-\ntry—radio stations—which changed the strategic requirements for \nsuccess.

For example, pending na-\ntional health insurance legislation with cost-plus reimbursement will \nfundamentally affect profit potential in the proprietary hospital and \nclinical laboratory industries. Requirements for licensing, an inter-\nmediate form of government regulation, tend to restrict entry and \nthereby provide an entry barrier protecting existing firms.

Fixed \ncommissions created a price umbrella for securities firms and shifted \ncompetition from price to service and research.

Firms enter an industry be-\ncause they perceive opportunities for growth and profits that exceed \nthe costs of entry (or of surmounting mobility barriers).9 Based on \ncase studies of many industries, industry growth seems to be the \nmost important signal to outsiders that there are future profits to be \nmade, even though this can often be a poor assumption. Entry also \nfollows particularly visible indications of future growth, such as reg-\nulatory changes, product innovations, and so on. For example, the \nenergy crisis and recent proposed legislation to provide federal sub-\nsidy have evoked rapid entry into solar heating even though demand \nfor solar heating is still quite low. \nThe entry into an industry (by either acquisition or internal de-\nvelopment) of an established firm is often a major driving force for \nindustry structural change.10 Established firms from other markets \ngenerally have skills or resources that can be applied to change com-\npetition in the new industry; in fact this often provides a major moti-\nvation for their entry decision. Such skills and resources are very \noften different from those of existing firms, and their application in \nmany cases changes the industry's structure. Also, firms in other \nmarkets may be able to perceive opportunities to change industry \nstructure better than existing firms because they have no ties to his-\ntorical strategies and may be in a position to be more aware of tech-\nnological changes occurring outside the industry that can be applied \nto competing in it. \nAn example will serve to illustrate.

In \nthe mid-1960s, however, a number of large consumer marketing \ncompanies (e.g., Heublein, United Brands) either entered the indus-\ntry through internal development or purchased existing wine produc-\ners.

Thus the entry of a different type of firm into the U.S. \nwine industry has caused or at least speeded up a significant structur-\nal change in the industry, and one which the early family-controlled \nparticipants in the industry had neither the skills, the resources, nor \nthe inclination to cause themselves. \nExit changes industry structure by reducing the number of firms \nand possibly increasing the dominance of the leading ones. Firms ex-\nit because they no longer perceive the possibility of earning returns \non their investment that exceed the opportunity cost of capital. The \nexit process is impeded by exit barriers (Chapter 1), which worsen \nthe position of remaining, healthier firms and may lead to price war-\nfare and other competitive outbreaks. Increases in concentration and \nthe ability of an industry's profitability to climb in response to in-\ndustry structural shifts also will be impeded by the presence of exit \nbarriers. \nThe evolutionary processes are a tool for predicting industry \nchanges. Each evolutionary process is the basis of a key strategic \nquestion. For example, the potential impact of government regula-\ntory change on an industry's structure means that a company must \nask itself, \"Are there any government actions on the horizon that \nmay influence some element of the structure of my industry? If so, \nwhat does the change do for my relative strategic position, and how \n\"The only important exception was Gallo, which as a result was to play a major role \nin the industry. \n",

The set of questions that result should be asked on a \nrepeated basis, perhaps even formally through the strategic planning \nprocess. \nFurthermore, each evolutionary process identifies a number of \nkey strategic signals, or pieces of key strategic information, for \nwhich the firm must constantly scan its environment. The entry of an \nestablished firm from another industry, a key development affecting \na substitute product, and so on should cause a red light to go in the \nminds of executives charged with maintaining the strategic health of \na business. This red light should trigger a chain of analysis to predict \nthe significance of the change for the industry and the appropriate \nresponse. \nFinally, it is important to note that learning, experience, in-\ncreasing market size, and several other of the processes discussed \nabove will be operating even if there are no important distinct events \nto signal this. The implication is that regular attention should be \ngiven to structural changes that may be resulting from these hidden \nprocesses. \nKey Relationships in Industry Evolution \nIn the context of this analysis, how do industries change? They \ndo not change in a piecemeal fashion, because an industry is an inter-\nrelated system. Change in one element of an industry's structure \ntends to trigger changes in other areas. For example, an innovation \nin marketing might develop a new buyer segment, but serving this \nnew segment may trigger changes in manufacturing methods, there-\nby increasing economies of scale. The firms reaping these economies \nfirst will also be in a position to start backward integration, which \nwill affect power with suppliers—and so on. One industry change, \ntherefore, often sets off a chain reaction leading to many other \nchanges. \nIt should be clear from the discussion in this chapter that \nwhereas industry evolution is always occurring in nearly every busi-\nness and requires a strategic response, there is no one way in which \nindustries evolve.

However, there are some par-\nticularly important relationships in the evolutionary process that I \nwill examine in this section.12 \nWILL THE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATE? \nIt seems to be an accepted fact that industries tend to consoli-\ndate over time, but as a general statement, it simply is not true. In a \nbroad sample of 151 4-digit U.S. manufacturing industries in the \n1963-1972 time period, for example, 69 increased in 4-firm concen-\ntration more than 2 percentage points, whereas 52 decreased more \nthan 2 percentage points over the same period. The question of \nwhether consolidation will occur in an industry exposes perhaps the \nmost important interrelationship among elements of industry struc-\nture—that involving competitive rivalry, mobility barriers, and exit \nbarriers. \nIndustry Concentration and Mobility Barriers Move Together. \nIf mobility barriers are high or especially if they increase, concentra-\ntion almost always increases. For example, concentration has in-\ncreased in the U.S. wine industry. In the standard-quality segment of \nthe market, which represents much of the volume, the strategic \nchanges described earlier in this chapter have greatly increased bar-\nriers to mobility (high advertising, national distribution, rapid brand \ninnovation, etc). As a result, the larger firms have gotten further \nahead of smaller ones, and few new firms have entered to challenge \nthem. \nNo Concentration Takes Place if Mobility Barriers Are Low or \nFalling. Where barriers are low, unsuccessful firms that exit will be \nreplaced by new firms. If a wave of exit has occurred because of an \neconomic downturn or some other general adversity, there may be a \ntemporary increase in industry concentration. But at the first signs \nthat profits and sales in the industry are picking up, new entrants \nwill appear. Thus a shake-out when an industry reaches maturity \ndoes not necessarily imply long-run consolidation. \n\"Industry evolution has implications for the optimal timing of entry into an \nindustry; they are discussed in Chapter 10. \n",

Exit barriers keep compan-\nies operating in an industry even though they are earning subnormal \nreturns on investment. Even in an industry with relatively high mo-\nbility barriers, the leading firms cannot count on reaping the benefits \nof consolidation if high exit barriers hold unsuccessful firms in the \nmarket. \nLong-run Profit Potential Depends on Future Structure. In \nthe period of very rapid growth early in the life of an industry (espe-\ncially after initial product acceptance has been achieved), profit \nlevels are usually high. For example, growth in sales of skiing equip-\nment were in excess of 20 percent per year in the late 1960s, and \nnearly all firms in the industry enjoyed strong financial results. \nWhen growth levels off in an industry, however, there is a period of \nturmoil as intensified rivalry weeds out the weaker firms. All firms \nin the industry may suffer financially during this adjustment period. \nWhether or not the remaining firms will enjoy above-average profit-\nability will depend on the level of mobility barriers, as well as the \nother structural features of the industry. If mobility barriers are high \nor have increased as the industry has matured, the remaining firms \nin the industry may enjoy healthy financial results even in the new \nera of slower growth. If mobility barriers are low, however, slower \ngrowth probably means the end of above-average profits for the in-\ndustry. Thus mature industries may or may not be as profitable as \nthey were in their developmental period. \nCHANGES IN INDUSTRY BOUNDARIES \nStructural change in an industry is often accompanied by \nchanges in industry boundaries. As discussed in Chapter 1, industry \nboundaries are a judgmental placement of the dotted line in Figure \n8-4. \nIndustry evolution has a strong tendency to shift these bounda-\nries. Innovations in the industry or those involving substitutes may \neffectively enlarge the industry by placing more firms into direct \ncompetition.

Third, where overcoming frag-\nmentation is unworkable, I will examine some of the alternatives for \ncoping with a fragmented structure. Related to this discussion, some \ntraps companies fall into in competing in fragmented industries will \nbe identified. Finally, I will present a basic analytical framework for \nthe formulation of competitive strategy in fragmented industries, \ndrawing on the earlier sections of this chapter. \nWhat Makes an Industry Fragmented? \nIndustries are fragmented for a wide variety of reasons, with \ngreatly differing implications for competing in them. Some indus-\ntries are fragmented for historical reasons—because of the resources \nor abilities of the firms historically in them—and there is no funda-\nmental economic basis for fragmentation. However, in many indus-\ntries there are underlying economic causes, and the principal ones \nseem to be as follows: \nLow Overall Entry Barriers. Nearly all fragmented industries \nhave low overall entry barriers. Otherwise they could not be popu-\nlated by so many small firms. However, although a prerequisite to \nfragmentation, low entry barriers are usually not sufficient to ex-\nplain it. Fragmentation is nearly always accompanied by one or \nmore of the other causes discussed below. \nAbsence of Economies of Scale or Experience Curve. Most \nfragmented industries are characterized by the absence of significant \nscale economies or learning curves in any major aspect of the busi-\nness, whether it be manufacturing, marketing, distribution, or re-\nsearch. Many fragmented industries have manufacturing processes \ncharacterized by few if any economies of scale or experience cost de-\nclines, because the process is a simple fabrication or assembly opera-\ntion (fiberglass and polyurethane molding), is a straightforward \nwarehousing operation (electronic component distribution), has an \ninherently high labor content (security guards), has a high personal \nservice content, or is intrinsically hard to mechanize or routinize. In \nan industry like lobster fishing, for example, the unit of production \nis the individual boat. Having multiple boats does little to lower fish-\ning costs because all boats are essentially fishing in the same waters \n",

Until recently, mushroom \nfarming has been similarly resistant to cost savings through scale or \nlearning. Finicky mushrooms have been grown in caves by many \nsmall operators who know the \"black art\" required. Recently this \nsituation has started to change, however, as will be discussed fur-\nther. \nHigh Transportation Costs. High transportation costs limit \nthe size of an efficient plant or production location despite the pres-\nence of economies of scale. Transportation costs balanced against \neconomies of scale determine the radius a plant can economically \nservice. Transportation costs are high in such industries as cement, \nfluid milk, and highly caustic chemicals. They are effectively high in \nmany service industries because the service is \"produced\" at the cus-\ntomer's premises or the customer must come to where the service is \nproduced. \nHigh Inventory Costs or Erratic Sales Fluctuations. Although \nthere may be intrinsic economies of scale in the production process, \nthey may not be reaped if inventory carrying costs are high and sales \nfluctuate. Here production has to be built up and down, which \nworks against the construction of large-scale, capital-intensive facil-\nities and operating them continuously. Similarly, if sales are very er-\nratic and fluctuate over a wide range, then the firm with large-scale \nfacilities may not have advantages over the smaller, more nimble \nfirm, even if the large firm's production operations are more effi-\ncient in a fully loaded state. Small-scale, less specialized facilities or \ndistribution systems are usually more flexible in absorbing output \nshifts than large, more specialized ones, even though they may have \nhigher operating costs at a steady operating rate. \nNo Advantages of Size in Dealing with Buyers or Suppliers. \nThe structure of the buyer groups and supplier industries is such that \na firm gains no significant bargaining power in dealing with these \nadjacent businesses from being large. Buyers, for example, might be \nso large that even a large firm in the industry would only be \nmarginally better off in bargaining with them than a smaller firm. \nSometimes powerful buyers or suppliers will be powerful enough to \nactually keep companies in the industry small, through intentionally \nspreading their business or encouraging entry. \nDiseconomies \nof Scale \nin \nSome Important Aspect. \nDiseconomies of scale can stem from a variety of factors.

In some industries buyers' tastes are \nfragmented, with different buyers each desiring special varieties of a \nproduct and willing (and able) to pay a premium for it rather than \naccept a more standardized version. Thus the demand for any partic-\nular product variety is small, and adequate volume is not present to \nsupport production, distribution, or marketing strategies that would \nyield advantages to the large firm. Sometimes fragmented buyers' \ntastes stem from regional or local differences in market needs, for \nexample, in the fire engine industry.

If there are exit barriers, marginal firms will \ntend to stay in the industry and thereby hold back consolidation. \nAside from economic exit barriers, managerial exit barriers appear \nto be common in fragmented industries. There may be competitors \nwith goals that are not necessarily profit-oriented. Certain busi-\nnesses may have a romantic appeal or excitement that attracts com-\npetitors who want to be in the industry despite low or even nonexist-\nent profitability.

The industry has historical-\nly been characterized by a large number of small ranchers grazing \ncattle on rangelands and transporting them to a meat-packer for \nprocessing. Raising cattle has traditionally involved few economies \nof scale; if anything, there could well be diseconomies of control-\nling a very large herd and moving it from area to area. However, \ntechnological developments have led to the wider use of the feedlot \nas an alternative process for fattening cattle. Under carefully con-\ntrolled conditions, the feedlot has proven to be a far cheaper way to \nput weight on animals. Constructing feedlots requires large capital \noutlays, though, and there appear to be significant economies of scale \nin their operation. As a result, some large beef growers, such as Iowa \nBeef and Monfort, are emerging and the industry is concentrating. \nThese large growers are beginning to be large enough to backward \nintegrate into processing of feeds and to forward integrate into meat \nprocessing and distribution. The latter has led to the development of \nbrand names. In this industry the fundamental cause of fragmenta-\ntion was the production technology utilized for fattening cattle. \nOnce this impediment to consolidation was removed, a process of \nstructural change was triggered which has encompassed many ele-\nments of industry structure going far beyond feedlots alone. \nCOMMON APPROACHES TO CONSOLIDATION \nOvercoming fragmentation is predicated on changes that unlock \nthe fundamental economic factors leading to the fragmented struc-\nture. Some common approaches to overcoming fragmentation are as \nfollows: \nCreate Economies of Scale or Experience Curve. As in the \nbeef cattle industry, if technological change leads to economies of \nscale or a significant experience curve, then consolidation can occur. \nEconomies of scale created in one part of the business can sometimes \noutweigh diseconomies in another. \nIn manufacturing, innovations leading to mechanization and \ngreater capital intensity have led to consolidation in the industry \nsupplying laboratory animals for medical research and in the mush-\nroom farming industry mentioned earlier in this chapter.

Such facilities yield a superior animal for research and also \nunlock the fundamental cause of fragmentation in the industry. In \nmushroom farming, a few large companies have entered the industry \nand pioneered sophisticated processes for controlled mushroom \ngrowth by using conveyors, climate controls, and other devices that \nreduce labor costs and boost yields. These processes involve signifi-\ncant economies of scale, capital outlays, and technological sophisti-\ncation and have provided a basis for consolidation to occur in the in-\ndustry. \nInnovations that create economies of scale in marketing can \nalso lead to industry consolidation. For example, the widespread \nadoption of network television as the primary means of marketing \ntoys has been accompanied by significant industry consolidation. \nThe emergence of the exclusive, full-line dealer offering financing \nand service has brought about consolidation among earthmoving \nequipment manufacturers, with Caterpillar Tractor the major bene-\nficiary. \nThe same basic arguments apply to creating scale economies in \nother functions, such as in distribution, service, and elsewhere. \nStandardize Diverse Market Needs. Product or marketing in-\nnovations can standardize heretofore diverse market needs. For ex-\nample, the creation of a new product might coalesce buyers' tastes; a \ndesign change might dramatically lower the cost of a standardized \nvariety, leading buyers to judge the standardized product a better \nvalue than the expensive, custom variety. Modularizing a product \nmight allow components to be produced in large volumes and there-\nby reap economies of scale or experience cost declines while main-\ntaining the heterogeneity of final products. The potential for such \ninnovations is clearly limited by the underlying economic character-\nistics of the industry, but in many industries the limiting factor to \nconsolidation has seemed to be ingenuity and creativity in finding \nways to deal with the causes of fragmentation. \nNeutralize or Split Off Aspects Most Responsible for Fragmen-\ntation.

Two striking examples of this are campgrounds and fast food. \nBoth these businesses rely on the need for tight local control and \nmaintaining good service. They must also intrinsically consist of \nsmall individual locations, because any potential economies of scale \nin campground or fast-food facilities are offset by the need to locate \nnear customers, or near the many major highways and vacation \nspots. Both the campground and fast-food industries have been his-\ntorically fragmented, with thousands and thousands of small, \nowner-managed operations. Yet there are significant economies of \nscale in marketing and purchasing in both these businesses, particu-\nlarly if national saturation can be achieved which allows the use of \nnational advertising media. In both industries, fragmentation was \novercome by franchising the individual locations to owner-manag-\ners, who operated under the mantle of a national organization \nwhich marketed the brand name and provided central purchasing \nand other services. Close control and maintenance of service are in-\nsured, as well as the benefits of economies of scale. This concept has \nspawned such giants as KOA in campgrounds and McDonald's, Piz-\nza Hut, and many others in fast food. Another industry in which \nfranchising is unlocking fragmentation today is real estate broker-\nage. Century 21 is rapidly expanding share in this highly fragmented \nindustry by franchising local firms, allowing them to operate auton-\nomously with their local names but doing so under the umbrella of \nthe nationally advertised Century 21 name. \nWhen the causes of fragmentation center around the production \nor service delivery process, as in the examples above, overcoming \nfragmentation requires decoupling production from the rest of the \nbusiness. If buyer segments are numerous or where extreme product \ndifferentiation leads to preferences for exclusivity, it may be possi-\nble—through the use of multiple, scrupulously disassociated brand \nnames and styles of packaging—to overcome the constraints placed \non market share. Another case is that in which an artist or other cus-\ntomer or supplier wants to deal with a smaller, more personalized or-\nganization with a particular image or reputation. In the record in-\ndustry, this desire has been dealt with by the use of multiple in-house \nlabels and contracts with associated labels, all of which use the same \nrecord pressing, marketing, promotion, and distribution organiza-\ntion. Each label is set up independently and strives to create the per-\nsonal touch for its artists. Yet the overall market share of the parent \ncompany can be significant, as in the case of CBS and Warner \nBrothers, each with about 20 percent of the market. \n",

Rather, \nthe strategy is to neutralize the parts of the business subject to frag-\nmentation to allow advantages of share in other aspects to come into \nplay. \nMake Acquisitions for a Critical Mass. In some industries \nthere may ultimately be some advantages to holding a significant \nshare, but it is extremely difficult to build share incrementally be-\ncause of the causes of fragmentation. For example, if local contacts \nare important in selling, it is difficult to invade the territory of other \nfirms in order to expand. But if the firm can develop a threshold \nshare, it can begin to reap any significant advantages of scale. In \ncases such as this, a strategy of making many acquisitions of local \ncompanies can be successful, provided the acquisitions can be inte-\ngrated and managed. \nRecognize Industry Trends Early. Sometimes industries con-\nsolidate naturally as they mature, particularly if the primary source \nof fragmentation was the newness of the industry; or exogenous in-\ndustry trends can lead to consolidation by altering the causes of frag-\nmentation. For example, computer service bureaus are facing in-\ncreasing competition from minicomputers and microcomputers. \nThis new technology means that even the small- and medium-sized \nfirm can afford to have its own computer.

This develop-\nment has increased the economies of scale in the service bureau in-\ndustry and is leading to consolidation. \nIn the service bureau example, the threat of substitute products \ntriggered consolidation by shifting buyers' needs, and thereby stimu-\nlating changes in service that were increasingly subject to economies \nof scale. In other industries, changes in buyers' tastes, changes in the \nstructure of distribution channels, and innumerable other industry \ntrends may operate, directly or indirectly, on the causes of fragmen-\ntation.

Yet a critical point to recognize \nfor purposes of strategy is that many industries are fragmented, not \nfor fundamental economic reasons, but because they are \"stuck\" in \na fragmented state.

Sometimes the steps \nrequired to overcome fragmentation are evident, but existing firms \nlack the resources to make the necessary strategic investments. For \nexample, there may be potential economies of scale in production, \nbut firms lack the capital or expertise to construct large-scale facili-\nties or to make required investments in vertical integration. Firms \nmay also lack the resources or skills to develop in-house distribution \nchannels, in-house service organizations, specialized logistical facili-\nties, or consumer brand franchises that would promote industry con-\nsolidation. \nExisting Firms Are Myopic or Complacent. Even though firms \nhave the resources to promote industry consolidation, they may be \nemotionally tied to traditional industry practices that support the \nfragmented structure or otherwise unable to perceive opportunities \nfor change. This fact, possibly combined with the lack of resources, \nmay partly explain the historical fragmentation of the U.S. wine in-\ndustry. Producers had long been production-oriented and had made \napparently little effort to develop national distribution or consumer \nbrand recognition. A number of large consumer goods and liquor \ncompanies bought their way into the industry in the mid-1960s and \nreversed this orientation. \nLack of Attention by Outside Firms.

No outsiders perceive the \nopportunity to infuse resources and a fresh perspective into the in-\ndustry to promote consolidation.

They may also be too new or too small to be of inter-\nest to major established firms which have the resources to overcome \nfragmentation. \nIf a firm can spot an industry in which the fragmented structure \ndoes not reflect the underlying economics of competition, this can \nprovide a most significant strategic opportunity. A company can en-\nter such an industry cheaply because of its initial structure. Since \nthere are no underlying economic causes of fragmentation, none of \nthe investment costs or risks of innovations to change underlying \neconomic structure need be borne. \nCoping with Fragmentation \nIn many situations, industry fragmentation is indeed the result \nof underlying industry economics that cannot be overcome.

Since fragmented indus-\ntries often are characterized by the need for intense coordination, \nlocal management orientation, high personal service, and close con-\ntrol, an important alternative for competition is tightly managed de-\ncentralization. Rather than increasing the scale of operations at one \nor a few locations, this strategy involves deliberately keeping indi-\nvidual operations small and as autonomous as possible. This ap-\nproach is supported by tight central control and performance-\noriented compensation for local managers. This strategy is being \npracticed with great success by Indal in the aluminum extrusion and \nfabricating industry in Canada, by several growing chains of small-\nand medium-sized newspapers that have sprung up in the United \nStates over the past decade, and by the highly successful Dillon \nCompanies in the food retailing industry, just to name a few exam-\nples. Dillon, for instance, has a strategy of acquiring a group of \nsmall, regional grocery chains and keeping them autonomous, each \nwith its own name, buying group, and so on. This system is rein-\nforced with central control and a strong promotion-from-within pol-\nicy. The strategy has avoided the homogenizing of individual units \nand resulting insensitivity to local conditions that plague some food \nchains, and as a by-product, has kept unionization low. \nThe essential notion of this type of strategy is to recognize and \ncater to the causes of fragmentation but to add a degree of profes-\nsionalism to the manner in which local managers operate. \n\"Formula\" Facilities. Another alternative, related to the pre-\nvious one, is to view the key strategic variable in the business as the \nbuilding of efficient, low-cost facilities at multiple locations. This \nstrategy involves designing a standard facility, whether it be a plant \nor a service establishment, and polishing to a science the process of \nconstructing and putting the facility into operation at minimum cost. \nThe firm thereby lowers its investment relative to competitors \nand/or provides a more attractive or efficient location from which \nto do business. Some of the most successful mobile home producers, \nsuch as Fleetwood, Inc., have followed this strategy. \nIncreased Value Added.

Enhanced product differentiation, and \nthereby higher margins, that cannot be achieved on the basic product \nor service may be achievable through such activities. This concept \nhas been successfully implemented by a number of metal distributors \nwho have positioned themselves as \"metal service centers,\" engag-\ning in simple fabrication operations and providing a great deal of ad-\nvice to the customer in what had historically been a purely pass-\nthrough business.

Unfortunately, the economics were such that its \nvessels had no significant advantage in catching lobsters over other \nfishermen, and its high overhead structure and heavy fixed costs \nmaximized the company's vulnerability to the inherent fluctuations \nof the catch in the industry. The high fixed costs also led to under-\ncutting on price by small fishermen who did not measure their busi-\nnesses against corporate ROI targets but seemed satisfied with a \nmuch lower return. The result was a financial crisis and eventual ces-\nsation of operations. Nothing in the Prelude strategy addressed the \ncauses of fragmentation in its industry, and hence its strategy of \ndominance was futile. \nLack of Strategic Discipline. Extreme strategic discipline is \nnearly always required for effective competition in fragmented in-\ndustries. Unless the cause of fragmentation can be overcome, the \ncompetitive structure of fragmented industries generally requires \nfocus or specialization on some tight strategic concept like those ar-\nticulated in the previous section. Implementing these may well re-\nquire the courage to turn away some business, as well as to go \nagainst the conventional wisdom of how things are done in the busi-\nness generally. An undisciplined or opportunistic strategy may work \nin the short run, but it usually maximizes the exposure of the firm to \nthe intense competitive forces common in fragmented industries in \nthe longer run. \nOver centralization. The essence of competition in many frag-\nmented industries is personal service, local contacts, close control of \noperations, ability to react to fluctuations or style changes, and so \non. A centralized organizational structure is counterproductive in \nmost cases, because it slows response time, lowers the incentives of \nthose at the local level, and can drive away skilled individuals neces-\nsary to perform many personal services.

Thus cen-\ntralization in these areas weakens rather than strengthens the firm. \nAssumption that Competitors Have the Same Overhead and Ob-\njectives. The peculiar nature of fragmented industries often means \nthat there are many small, privately held firms. Also, owner-manag-\ners may have noneconomic reasons for being in the business. Under \nthese circumstances, the assumption that these competitors will have \nan overhead structure or objectives of a corporation is a serious er-\nror. They often work out of homes, use family labor, and avoid reg-\nulatory costs and the need to offer employee benefits. Even though \nsuch competitors may be \"inefficient,\" it does not mean that their \ncosts are high relative to those of a corporation in the same business. \nSimilarly, such competitors may be satisfied with much different \n(and lower) levels of profitability than a corporation, and they may \nbe much more interested in keeping up volume and providing work \nfor their employees than profitability per se. Thus their reactions to \nprice changes and to other industry events may be a lot different \nthan the \"normal\" company. \nOverreactions to New Products. In a fragmented industry the \nlarge number of competitors almost always insures that the buyer \nwill exercise a great deal of power and be able to play one competitor \nagainst the other. In such a setting, products early in their life can \noften appear as salvations to an otherwise intense competitive situa-\ntion. With rapidly growing demand and buyers generally unfamiliar \nwith the new product, price competition may be modest and buyers \nmay be clamoring for education and service from the firm. This is \nsuch a welcomed relief in the fragmented industry that firms make \nmajor investments in gearing up to respond. At the first signs of ma-\nturity, however, the fragmented structure catches up with demand \nand the margins that were there to support these investments disap-\npear. Thus there is a risk of overreacting to new products in ways \nthat will raise costs and overhead and put the firm at a competitive \ndisadvantage in the price competition that is a fact of life in many \nfragmented industries. Although coping with new products is a diffi-\ncult problem in all industries, it seems especially difficult in frag-\nmented businesses. \n",

Next, I will identify the \ncharacteristic problems encountered in the development of a new in-\ndustry, that limit its growth and are central to the jockeying for posi-\ntion among competitors. The factors that determine the buyers or \nbuyer segments that will be early buyers, or \"early adopters,\" of the \nnew industry's product will be identified. Identifying these buyers is \ncrucial, not only for formulating competitive strategy directly, but \nalso for forecasting industry development since early adopters can \nhave a major impact on the way in which an industry designs, pro-\nduces, delivers, and markets its product. \nHaving identified some key aspects of the environment in \nemerging industries, I will then consider some important strategic \nchoices that firms in them must face and some strategic alternatives \nthat can be successful in coping with them.

Most \nof them relate either to the absence of established bases for competi-\ntion or other rules of the game or to the initial small size and newness \nof the industry. \nCOMMON STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS \nTechnological Uncertainty.

Alternative pro-\nduction technologies may also be present, all of which have been \nuntried on a large-scale basis. In the manufacture of optical fibers, \nfor example, there are at least five different processes backed by dif-\nferent industry participants. \nStrategic Uncertainty. Related to the technological uncertain-\nty, but broader in cause, are a wide variety of strategic approaches \noften being tried by industry participants. No \"right\" strategy has \nbeen clearly identified, and different firms are groping with differ-\nent approaches to product/market positioning, marketing, servic-\ning, and so on, as well as betting on different product configurations \nor production technologies. For example, solar heating firms are \ntaking a wide variety of stances with respect to supplying compo-\nnents versus systems, market segmentation, and distribution chan-\nnels. Closely related to this problem, firms often have poor informa-\ntion about competitors, characteristics of customers, and industry \nconditions in the emerging phase.

Even for technologies for which the learning curve will soon \nlevel off, there is usually a very steep learning curve operating. Ideas \ncome rapidly in terms of improved procedures, plant layout, and so \non, and employees achieve major gains in productivity as job famil-\niarity increases. Increasing sales make major additions to the scale \nand total accumulated volume of output produced by firms. These \nfactors are accentuated if, as is common, the technology in the \n'Abernathy usefully terms this the absence of a \"dominant design\" for the product \nor service. See Abernathy (1978). \n",

If the gains due to \nlearning are combined with increasing opportunities to reap econo-\nmies of scale as the industry grows, the cost declines will be even \nmore rapid. \nEmbryonic Companies and Spin-Offs. The emerging phase of \nthe industry is usually accompanied by the presence of the greatest \nproportion of newly formed companies (to be contrasted with newly \nformed units of established firms) that the industry will ever experi-\nence. Witness the many new firms populating such contemporary \nemerging industries as personal computers and solar heating and \nwhich characterized the early automobile industry (Packard, Hud-\nson, Nash, and dozens of others) and early minicomputer industry \n(e.g., Digital Equipment, Data General, Computer Automation). \nWithout established rules of the game or scale economies as deter-\nrents, newly formed companies are in a position to get into emerging \nindustries (this situation will be discussed further). \nRelated to the presence of newly formed companies is that of \nmany spin-off firms, or firms created by personnel leaving firms in \nthe industry to create their own new firms. Digital Equipment \nspawned a number of spin-offs in minicomputers (e.g., Data Gener-\nal) as did Varian Associates (e.g., General Automation), and Honey-\nwell, and we could cite many other industries in which spin-offs were \nnumerous. The phenomenon of spin-offs is related to a number of \nfactors. First, in an environment of rapid growth and perceived op-\nportunity, the rewards of equity participation may seem attractive \nwhen compared to a salary at an established company. Second, be-\ncause of the fluidity of technology and strategy in the emerging \nphase, employees of established firms are often in a good position to \nthink up new and better ideas, taking advantage of their proximity to \nthe industry. Sometimes they leave in order to increase their poten-\ntial rewards, but not infrequently spin-offs occur because the em-\nployee with a new idea confronts an unwillingness of his superior to \ntry it, perhaps because it undermines much of the investment the \nfirm has made in the past.

Provided industry structure does \nnot provide substantial entry barriers to newly created firms, spin-\noffs can be a common phenomenon in emerging industries. \nFirst-Time Buyers. Buyers of the emerging industry's product \nor service are inherently first-time buyers. The marketing task is thus \none of inducing substitution, or getting the buyer to purchase the \nnew product or service instead of something else. The buyer must be \ninformed about the basic nature and functions of the new product or \nservice, be convinced that it can actually perform these functions, \nand be persuaded that the risks of purchasing it are rationally borne \ngiven the potential benefits. Right now, for example, solar heating \ncompanies are struggling to persuade homeowners and homebuyers \nthat the cost savings of solar heating are real, that systems will per-\nform reliably, and that they need not wait for further government \ntax incentives to commit to the new technology. I will have much \nmore to say later about the factors prompting buyers to commit \nthemselves early to a new product or service. \nShort Time Horizon. In many emerging industries the pres-\nsure to develop customers or produce products to meet demand is so \ngreat that bottlenecks and problems are dealt with expediently rather \nthan as a result of an analysis of future conditions. At the same time, \nindustry conventions are often born out of pure chance: Confronted \nwith the need to set a pricing schedule, for example, one firm adopts \na two-tiered price that the marketing manager used in his previous \nfirm, and the other firms in the industry imitate for lack of a ready \nalternative. In both these ways \"conventional wisdom,\" which was \ndiscussed in Chapter 3, is created. \nSubsidy. In many emerging industries, especially those with \nradical new technology or that address areas of societal concern, \nthere may be subsidization of early entrants. Subsidy may come \nfrom a variety of government and nongovernment sources; heavy \nsubsidies in solar energy and conversion of fossil fuels into gas are \nparticularly prominent examples of the early 1980s. Subsidies can be \nawarded directly to firms in the form of grants, or can operate indi-\nrectly through tax incentives, subsidizing buyers, and so on. Subsi-\ndies often add a great degree of instability to an industry, which is \nmade dependent on political decisions that can be quickly reversed \n",

While subsidies are obviously beneficial to industry de-\nvelopment in some respects, they often deeply involve government \nbodies in an industry, which can be a mixed blessing. Yet the need to \novercome startup difficulties leads many emerging industries to seek \nsubsidies; aquaculturists are actively lobbying for them in 1980. \nEARLY MOBILITY BARRIERS \nIn an emerging industry, the configuration of mobility barriers \nis often predictably different from that which will characterize the \nindustry later in its development. Common early barriers are the fol-\nlowing: \n• proprietary technology; \n• access to distribution channels; \n• access to raw materials and other inputs (skilled labor) of ap-\npropriate cost and quality; \n• cost advantages due to experience, made more significant by \nthe technological and competitive uncertainties; \n• risk, which raises the effective opportunity cost of capital and \nthereby effective capital barriers. \nAs discussed in Chapter 8, some of these barriers—such as pro-\nprietary technology, access to distribution, learning effects, and \nrisk—have a strong tendency to decline or disappear in importance \nas the industry develops. Although there are exceptions, early mobil-\nity barriers are usually not brand identification (it is just being cre-\nated), economies of scale (the industry is too small to allow them), or \ncapital (today's large firms can generate prodigious capital for a \nlow-risk investment). \nThe nature of the early barriers is a key reason why we observe \nnewly created companies in emerging industries. The typical early \nbarriers stem less from the need to command massive resources than \nfrom the ability to bear risk, be creative technologically, and make \nforward-looking decisions to garner input supplies and distribution \nchannels. These same sorts of barriers also help explain why estab-\nlished companies are often not the first firms into new industries, \neven if they have obvious strengths, but climb on the bandwagon \nlater.

For \nexample, the toy companies were relatively late entrants into video \ngames despite some obvious strengths like knowledge of customers, \nbrand names, and distribution.

Similarly, the traditional vac-\nuum tube firms were late entrants into semiconductor manufacture, \nand the electric coffee percolator manufacturers were beaten in auto-\nmatic drip coffee makers by new firms such as Mr. Coffee. There \nmay be some advantages to late entry, however, that will be dis-\ncussed later. \nProblems Constraining Industry Development \nEmerging industries usually face limits or problems, of varying \nseverity, in getting the industry off the ground. These stem from the \nnewness of the industry, its dependence for growth on other outside \neconomic entities, and externalities in its development that result \nfrom its need to induce substitution by buyers to its product. \nInability to Obtain Raw Materials and Components. The de-\nvelopment of an emerging industry requires that new suppliers be es-\ntablished or existing suppliers expand output and/or modify raw \nmaterials and components to meet the industry's needs. In the proc-\ness, severe shortages of raw materials and components are very com-\nmon in emerging industries. For example, acute shortages of color \npicture tubes in the mid-1960s was a major strategic factor affecting \nindustry participants. Video game chips, particularly those for sin-\ngle-chip games pioneered by General Instrument, were very scarce \nand all but unavailable to new entrants for over a year after their in-\ntroduction. \nPeriod of Rapid Escalation of Raw Materials Prices. Con-\nfronted with burgeoning demand and inadequate supply, prices for \nkey raw materials often skyrocket in the early phases of an emerging \nindustry.

This fall-off will not happen \nwhen supplies of raw materials cannot expand easily, such as in min-\neral bearing lands and skilled labor. \nAbsence of Infrastructure. Emerging industries are often \nfaced with difficulties like those of material supply caused by the \nlack of appropriate infrastructure: distribution channels, service fa-\ncilities, trained mechanics, complementary products (e.g., appropri-\nate campsites for recreational vehicles; coal supplies for coal gasifi-\ncation technology), and the like. \nAbsence of Product or Technological Standardization. Inabil-\nity to agree on product or technical standards accentuates problems \nin the supply of raw materials or complementary products, and can \nimpede cost improvements. The lack of agreement is usually caused \nby the high level of product and technological uncertainty that still \nremains in an emerging industry. \nPerceived Likelihood of Obsolescence. An emerging indus-\ntry's growth will be impeded if buyers perceive that second- or third-\ngeneration technologies will significantly make obsolete currently \navailable products. Buyers will wait instead for the pace of techno-\nlogical progress and cost reduction to slow down.

Emerging industries are often beset by \ncustomers' confusion, which results from the presence of a multi-\nplicity of product approaches, technological variations, and con-\nflicting claims and counterclaims by competitors. All these are \nsymptomatic of technological uncertainty and the resulting lack of \nstandardization and general technical agreement by industry partici-\npants. Such confusion can limit industry sales by raising the new \nbuyers' perceived risk of purchase. For example, the conflicting \nclaims being made by ionization versus photoelectric smoke alarm \nmanufacturers are believed by some observers to be causing buyers \nto postpone purchases.

With many newly established firms, \nlack of standards, and technological uncertainty, product quality is \noften erratic in emerging industries. This erratic quality, even if \ncaused by only a few firms, can negatively affect the image and cred-\nibility of the entire industry. Video game defects, such as the burning \nof television picture tubes, have set back early growth in much the \nsame way as the erratic performance of digital watches (and of newly \nestablished franchised automobile tune-up centers) has led to cus-\ntomers' suspicion. \nImage and Credibility with the Financial Community. As a re-\nsult of newness, the high level of uncertainty, customer confusion, \nand erratic quality, the emerging industry's image and credibility \nwith the financial community may be poor.

Having reached significant size, however, mineral water pro-\nducers are being drowned in regulations about labeling and health.\" \nThe same phenomenon occurred in bicycles and chain saws; once a \ngrowth boom increased the size of the industry, regulators took no-\ntice. \nHigh Costs.

For example, most electric utilities are \nlobbying against solar energy subsidies because they believe solar \npower will not relieve needs for peak load electrical capacity. Con-\nstruction unions fought bitterly against modular housing. \nThe threatened entity can fight the emerging industry in a num-\nber of ways. One is in the regulatory or political arena; another is at \nthe collective bargaining table. In the case of an industry threatened \nby substitution, its response can take the form of foregoing profits \nby lowering prices (or raising costs such as marketing) or making \nR&D investments aimed at making the threatened product or service \nmore competitive. Figure 10-1 illustrates the latter choice.5 If the \nthreatened industry chooses to invest to try to bring its quality-\nadjusted costs down, it is clear that the target at which learning and \nscale-related cost reductions in the emerging industry must shoot is a \nmoving one. \n\"\"Mineral Water Could Drown in Regulation,\" Business Week, June 11,1979. \n'This diagram was suggested by John Forbus of McKinsey & Company. \n",

A number of criteria seem to be crucial in determining this \nreceptivity, some of which can be influenced or overcome by firms in \nthe emerging industry.7 \nNature of the Benefit. Perhaps the single most important de-\nterminant of the receptivity of the buyer to a new product or service \nis the nature of the expected benefit. We can imagine a continuum of \nbenefits ranging from a new product that offers a performance ad-\nvantage unachievable through other means to one that offers solely a \ncost advantage. Intermediate cases are those offering an advantage \nin performance but one that could be replicated through other means \nat higher cost. \nThe earliest markets purchasing a new product, other things be-\ning equal, are usually those in which the advantage is one of per-\nformance. This situation occurs because the achievement of a cost \nadvantage in practice is often viewed with suspicion when buyers \nconfront the newness, uncertainty, and often erratic performance of \nthe emerging industry, among other factors to be discussed later. \nWhether the benefit from the new product is one of cost or perform-\nance, however, the receptivity of the buyer depends on a number of \nother aspects of the nature of the benefit it offers: \nPERFORMANCE ADVANTAGE \n• How large is the performance advantage for the particular \nbuyers? Buyers will differ in this regard because of differ-\nences in their situations. \n• How obvious is the advantage? \n• How pressing is the need for the buyer to improve along the \ndimension offered by the new product? \n• Does the performance advantage improve the competitive po-\nsition of the buyer? \n• How strong is competitive pressure to compel changeover? \nPerformance advantages that help counter a threat to the \nbuyer's business or are defensive in nature usually stimulate \nadoption before those that offer a chance to improve compet-\nitively on an offensive basis. \n• How price and/or cost sensitive is the buyer, if the added per-\nformance entails higher cost? \n'These criteria can also be applied to forecasting early markets for a new product \nvariety in an established industry. \n",

In such cases buyers usually will purchase the lowest cost \nalternative that meets the technical requirements. \nState of the Art Required to Yield Significant Benefits. A sec-\nond key factor in determining whether buyers will adopt the new \nproduct early is the technological performance their application de-\nmands of the product. Some buyers may be able to achieve valuable \nbenefits even with rudimentary versions of the new product, whereas \nothers will require more sophisticated varieties. For example, scien-\ntists in the laboratory were satisfied with relatively high-cost and \nlow-speed minicomputers to solve data processing problems for \nwhich no real alternatives existed. Conversely, accounting and con-\ntrol applications required lower-cost and more sophisticated ver-\nsions, and these applications developed later. \nCost of Product Failure. Buyers who face a relatively high \ncost of product failure will usually be slower in adopting a new prod-\nuct than ones whose risk is lower. Buyers whose use for the new \nproduct involves plugging it into an integrated system often face \nvery high failure costs, as do buyers who pay particularly high penal-\nties for interrupted service of the product for some reason. The cost \nof failure also depends on the resources of the buyers. For example, \nwealthy individuals are probably less concerned that their newly pur-\nchased snowmobile does not work or does not provide the claimed \nbenefits than are individuals for whom the purchase will effectively \nnegate possibilities for acquiring other leisure-time products. \nIntroduction or Switching Costs.

These costs are analogous to switch-\ning costs, which are discussed in Chapters 1 and 6, and include the \nfollowing: \n• costs of retraining employees; \n• costs of acquiring new ancillary equipment; \n• write-offs due to undepreciated investment (net of salvage \nvalue) in old technology; \n• capital requirements for changeover; \n• engineering or R&D costs of changeover; \n• costs in modifying interrelated stages of production or related \naspects of the business. \nChangeover costs can be subtle. For example, when adopting \nthe new coal gasification technology instead of purchasing gas from \na utility, a prospective buyer often must cope with changes in the \nchemical properties of the gas. For some buyers this affects the per-\nformance of the gas in their downstream manufacturing operations \nand requires investments in modification there. \nChangeover costs are often influenced by the pace of change-\nover, when the pace is discretionary, and also by such factors as \n• whether the new product is serving a new function or replac-\ning an existing product; replacement often involves the added \ncost of retraining, undepreciated investment, and so on; \n• length of redesign cycles; it is usually easier to substitute a \nnew product during a period of normal redesign than if the \nsubstitution requires an unscheduled redesign. \nSupport Services. Closely related to changeover costs in influ-\nencing timing of adoption are the requirements the buyer faces for \nsupport services (e.g., engineering, repair) to cope with the new \nproduct, relative to the capability of the buyer. For example, if the \nnew product requires skilled operators or service technicians, it is \nlikely to be adopted first by buyers who either have such resources \nalready or have experience in dealing with them. \nCost of Obsolescence. For particular buyers, the degree to \nwhich successive generations of technology in the emerging industry \nwill make early versions of the product obsolete varies.

Yet all these factors have another side—the \nemerging phase of an industry's development is probably the period \nwhen the strategic degrees of freedom are the greatest and when the \nleverage from good strategic choices is the highest in determining \nperformance. \nShaping Industry Structure. The overriding strategic issue in \nemerging industries is the ability of the firm to shape industry struc-\nture. Through its choices, the firm can try to set the rules of the game \nin areas like product policy, marketing approach, and pricing strat-\negy. Within the constraints set by the underlying economics of the \nindustry and its resources, the firm should seek to define the rules in \nthe industry in a manner that will yield it the strongest position in the \nlong run. \nExternalities in Industry Development.

Because of \npotential problems with industry image, credibility, and confusion \nof buyers (outlined in Section II in this chapter), in the emerging \nphase the firm is in part dependent on others in the industry for its \nown success. The overriding problem for the industry is inducing \nsubstitution and attracting first-time buyers, and it is usually in the \nfirm's interest during this phase to help promote standardization, \npolice substandard quality and fly-by-night producers, and present a \nconsistent front to suppliers, customers, government, and the finan-\ncial community. Industry conferences and associations can be a use-\nful device, as can the avoidance of strategies that degrade competi-\ntors. For example, in the hospital management industry that has \ngrown up since 1970, all the participants are critically dependent on \nthe industry's image of professionalism and its credibility with lend-\ners. Firms in this industry have had a practice of actually praising the \nindustry and their competitors by name. \nThis need for industry cooperation during the emerging period \noften seems to raise an internal dilemma for firms, who are driven \ntoward pursuing their own market position, often to the detriment \nof industry development. A firm may resist standardization on prod-\nucts, needed to aid ease of repair and promote customers' confidence, \nbecause it wants to maintain uniqueness or garner the advantage of \nhaving its particular product variety adopted as standard.

Some firms in the smoke alarm in-\ndustry, for example, are advocating industry standards that will hurt \nother firms. At the same time, buyers' confusion is continuing about \njust what kind of alarm is best. The question is whether the industry \nis developed enough for such confusion to be a significant problem \nfor future industry growth. \nIt is probably a valid generalization that the balance between in-\ndustry outlook and firm outlook must shift in the direction of the \nfirm as the industry begins to achieve significant penetration. Some-\ntimes firms who have taken very high profiles as industry spokesper-\nsons, much to their and the industry's benefit, fail to recognize that \nthey must shift their orientation. As a result, they can be left behind \nas the industry matures. \nAnother implication of externalities in industry development is \nthe possibility that a firm may have to compete initially with a strat-\negy it ultimately does not want to follow or participate in market \nsegments it plans to drop out of in the long run. These \"temporary\" \nactions may be necessary to develop the industry, but once it is devel-\noped the firm is free to seek its optimal position. For example, Corn-\ning Glass Works has been forced to invest in research on connectors, \nsplicing techniques, and light sources for fiber optic applications— \neven though in the long run Corning seems to want to be a fiber and \ncable supplier only—because the quality of available equipment and \ntechniques has been an impediment to the development of fiber op-\ntics generally. Such investments outside the firm's ideal long-run po-\nsition are part of the cost of pioneering. \nChanging Role of Suppliers and Channels. Strategically, the \nfirm in an emerging industry must be prepared for a possible shift in \nthe orientation of its suppliers and distribution channels as the in-\ndustry grows in size and proves itself. Suppliers may become increas-\ningly willing (or can be forced) to respond to the industry's special \nneeds in terms of varieties, service, and delivery. Similarly, distribu-\ntion channels may become more receptive to investing in facilities, \nadvertising, and so forth in partnership with the firms. Early exploi-\ntation of these changes in orientation can give the firm strategic lev-\nerage. \nShifting Mobility Barriers.

The most obvious is that the firm must be prepared to \nfind new ways to defend its position and must not rely solely on \nthings like proprietary technology and a unique product variety on \nwhich it has succeeded in the past. Responding to shifting mobility \nbarriers may involve commitments of capital that far exceed those \nthat have been necessary in the early phases. \nAnother implication is that the nature of entrants into the in-\ndustry may shift to more established firms attracted to the larger and \nincreasingly proven (less risky) industry, often competing on the \nbasis of the newer forms of mobility barriers, like scale and market-\ning clout. The firm in an emerging industry must forecast the nature \nof probable potential entrants based on its assessment of present and \nfuture barriers, coupled with the attraction the industry will hold to \nvarious types of firms and their ability to hurdle the barriers cheaply. \nAnother implication related to increasing industry size and tech-\nnological maturity is that customers or suppliers may integrate into \nthe industry—which has occurred in such industries as aerosol pack-\naging, recreational vehicles, and electronic calculators. The firm \nmust be prepared to secure supplies and markets if integration oc-\ncurs or stop integration moves by the way in which it competes. \nTIMING ENTRY \nA crucial strategic choice for competing in emerging industries \nis the appropriate timing of entry. Early entry (or pioneering) in-\nvolves high risk but may involve otherwise low entry barriers and \ncan offer a large return. Early entry is appropriate when the follow-\ning general circumstances hold: \n• Image and reputation of the firm are important to the buyer, \nand the firm can develop an enhanced reputation by being a \npioneer. \n• Early entry can initiate the learning process in a business in \nwhich the learning curve is important, experience is difficult \nto imitate, and it will not be nullified by successive technolog-\nical generations. \n• Customer loyalty will be great, so that benefits will accrue to \nthe firm that sells to the customer first. \n• Absolute cost advantages can be gained by early commitment \nto supplies of raw materials, distribution channels, and so on. \n",

The firm, therefore, builds the wrong skills and \nmay face high costs of changeover. \n• Costs of opening up the market are great, including such \nthings as customer education, regulatory approvals, and tech-\nnological pioneering, and the benefits of opening up the mar-\nket cannot be made proprietary to the firm. \n• Early competition with small, newly started firms will be \ncostly, but these firms will be replaced by more formidable \ncompetition later. \n• Technological change will make early investments obsolete \nand allow firms entering later to have an advantage by having \nthe newest products and processes. \nTactical Moves. The problems limiting development of an \nemerging industry suggest some tactical moves that may improve the \nfirm's strategic position: \n• Early commitments to suppliers of raw materials will yield fa-\nvorable priorities in times of shortages. \n• Financing can be timed to take advantage of a Wall Street \nlove affair with the industry if it happens, even if financing is \nahead of actual needs.

Although it may sometimes be appropriate to respond to com-\npetitors vigorously in the emerging phase, it is more likely that the \nfirm's efforts are best spent in building its own strengths and in de-\nveloping the industry. It may even be appropriate to encourage the \nentry of certain competitors, perhaps through licensing or other \nmeans. Given the characteristics of the emerging phase, the firm of-\nten benefits from having other firms aggressively selling the indus-\ntry's product and aiding in technological development. The firm \nmay also want competitors who are known quantities, rather than \npreserving a large share for itself but inviting entry by major estab-\nlished firms as the industry matures.

Unfortunately, however, the \nnumber of variables that enter into such a forecast is usually stagger-\ning.

Scenarios are discrete, internally consistent views of how \nthe world will look in the future, which can be selected to bound the \nprobable range of outcomes that might feasibly occur. Scenarios can \nbe used for forecasting in emerging industries as shown in Figure \n10-2. The starting point for forecasting is estimating the future evo-\nlution of product and technology, in such terms as cost, product va-\nriety, and performance. The analyst should select a small number of \ninternally consistent product/technology scenarios that encompasses \nthe range of possible outcomes. For each of these scenarios, the ana-\nlyst then creates a scenario of which markets will open up and what \ntheir size and characteristics will be.

Moreover, in response to strategic break-\nthroughs, mature industries may regain their rapid growth and \nthereby go through more than one transition to maturity. With these \nimportant qualifications in mind, however, let us consider the case \nin which a transition to maturity is occurring and possibilities for \nforestalling such a transition have been exhausted. \nWhen it occurs, the transition to maturity is nearly always a \ncritical period for companies in an industry.

Moreover, the \nimpact of transition to maturity extends beyond strategic considera-\ntions, holding implications for the organizational structure of the \nfirm and the role of its leadership. These administrative implications \nare at the heart of some of the difficulties in making the required \nstrategic adjustments. \nThis chapter will examine some of these issues, drawing on the \nanalytical base in Part I of this book. It will focus on identifying the \nstrategic and administrative problems raised by the transition rather \nthan on an analysis of the process itself. Industry evolution itself is \ntreated in more depth in Chapter 8. \nIndustry Change during Transition \nTransition to maturity can often signal a number of important \nchanges in an industry's competitive environment. Some of the \nprobable tendencies for change are as follows: \n1. Slowing growth means more competition for market share. \nWith companies unable to maintain historical growth rates merely \nby holding market share, competitive attention turns inward toward \nattacking the shares of the others. This situation occurred in 1978 in \nthe dishwasher business, which was becoming saturated, when both \nGE and Maytag began to attack Hobart aggressively in the higher-\nprice segments of the market. Increased competition for market \nshare requires a fundamental reorientation in a company's perspec-\ntive and a completely new set of assumptions about how competitors \nwill behave and react. Competitor analysis like that described in \nChapters 3 and 4 must be repeated. Knowledge of competitors' \ncharacteristics and their reactions that has been gained in the past \nmust be reassessed, if not discarded. Not only are competitors prob-\nably going to be more aggressive, but also the likelihood of misper-\nceptions and \"irrational\" retaliation is great. Outbreaks of price, \nservice, and promotional warfare are common during transition to \nmaturity. \n2. Firms in the industry increasingly are selling to experienced, \nrepeat buyers. The product is no longer new but an established, legit-\nimate item. Buyers are often increasingly knowledgeable and experi-\nenced, having already purchased the product, sometimes repeatedly. \n",

There is a topping-out problem in adding industry capacity \nand personnel. As the industry adjusts to slower growth, the rate of \ncapacity addition in the industry must slow down as well or overca-\npacity will occur. Thus companies' orientations toward adding ca-\npacity and personnel must fundamentally shift and be disassociated \nfrom the euphoria of the past. A firm is confronted with the need to \nmonitor competitors' capacity additions closely and to time its ca-\npacity additions with precision. Rapid growth will no longer quickly \ncover mistakes by rapidly eliminating excess capacity. \nThese shifts in perspective rarely occur in maturing industries, \nand overshooting of industry capacity relative to demand is com-\nmon. Overshooting leads to a period of overcapacity, accentuating \nthe tendency during transition toward price warfare.

If the firm \nmust respond to such changes in functional policy, capital resources \nand new skills are almost always required.

New products and applications are harder to come by. \nWhereas the growth phase may have been one of rapid discovery of \nnew products and applications, the ability to continue product \nchange generally becomes increasingly limited, or the costs and risks \ngreatly increase, as the industry matures. This change requires, \namong other things, a reorientation of attitude toward research and \nnew product development. \n7. International competition increases. As a consequence of \ntechnological maturity, often accompanied by product standardiza-\ntion and increasing emphasis on costs, transition is often marked by \nthe emergence of significant international competition. The forces \nleading to internationalization of an industry are discussed in detail \nin Chapter 13, as are some of the key implications of global competi-\ntion. International competitors often have different cost structures \nand different goals than domestic firms and a home market base \nfrom which to operate. Significant exports or foreign investment by \ndomestic firms usually predates transition to maturity in a large mar-\nket like the United States. \n8. Industry profits often fall during the transition period, \nsometimes temporarily and sometimes permanently. Slowing \ngrowth, more sophisticated buyers, more emphasis on market share, \nand the uncertainties and difficulties of the required strategic \nchanges usually mean that industry profits fall in the short run from \nthe levels of the pretransition growth phase. Some firms may be \nmore affected than others, the firms with smaller share usually the \nmost. Falling profits reduce cash flow during a period when it may \nbe sorely needed. They also tend to send stock prices tumbling for \npublicly held companies and increase the difficulty of raising debt fi-\nnancing. Whether or not profits will rebound depends on the level of \nmobility barriers and other elements of industry structure which \nhave been discussed in Part I. \n9. Dealers' margins fall, but their power increases. For the \nsame reasons that industry profits are often depressed, dealers' mar-\ngins may be squeezed, and many dealers may drop out of the busi-\nness—often before the effect on manufacturers' profits is notice-\nable. This factor may be seen recently among dealers of television \nreceivers and recreational vehicles. Such trends tighten competition \namong industry participants for dealers, who may have been easy to \nfind and hold in the growth phase but not upon maturity. Thus, \ndealers' power may increase markedly. \n",

Each ma-\njor element of industry structure often is changing: overall mobility \nbarriers, the relative significance of various barriers, the intensity of \nrivalry (it usually increases), and so on. Structural change nearly al-\nways means that firms must respond strategically, because it implies \nthat the fundamental nature of competition changes correspondingly \nin the industry. \nSome characteristic strategic issues often arise in transition. \nThese are presented as issues to examine rather than generalizations \nthat will apply to all industries; like humans, all industries mature a \nlittle differently.

Cost competi-\ntion and fights for market share are too demanding. As a result, a \nquantum improvement in the sophistication of product costing is \nnecessary to allow pruning of unprofitable items from the line and to \nfocus attention on items either that have some distinctive advantage \n(technology, cost, image, etc.) or whose buyers are \"good\" buyers.1 \nAverage costing for groups of products, or the loading of average \noverhead for costing purposes, becomes inadequate for evaluating \nthe product line and possible additions to it. The need to rationalize \nthe product line sometimes creates the need to install computerized \ncosting systems, which had not been of high priority during the in-\ndustry's developmental years. Such line pruning has been crucial to \nRCA's success with Hertz, for example. \nCORRECT PRICING \nRelated to product line rationalization is the change in pricing \nmethodology that is often necessary in maturity. Although average-\ncost pricing, or pricing the line as a whole rather than as individual \nitems, may have been sufficient in the growth era,2 maturity often \nrequires increased capability to measure costs on individual items \nand to price accordingly. Implicit cross-subsidization within the \nproduct line through average-cost pricing hides products whose mar-\nkets cannot support their true costs and gives away profits in those \nsituations in which buyers are not price sensitive. Cross-subsidiza-\ntion also invites price cutting or new product introductions by com-\npetitors against the items priced artificially high. Competitors who \nlack the costing sophistication to price rationally, and hence who re-\ntard the adjustment of prices on unrealistically low-priced items, are \nsometimes a problem in mature industries. \nSometimes other aspects of pricing strategy can and should be \nchanged in maturity. For example, Mark Controls has achieved \ngreat success in the tough valve business by eliminating unprofitable \nlines and also by renegotiating contracts with buyers to include esca-\nlator clauses for inflation. Contracts in the industry traditionally \nhad been fixed price, and inflation adjustments were not critical to \nraising prices in the growth phase; no other firm had ever had to ne-\ngotiate escalator clauses.

Raising financial con-\nsciousness may be more or less difficult in the industry depending on \nthe training and orientation of management.

Southland is adding fast \nfood, self-service gas, pinball machines, and other lines to its stores \nto capture a bigger share of its customers' dollars and to increase im-\npulse buying and avoid the cost of establishing new locations. Simi-\nlarly, HFC is adding new services, such as tax preparation, larger \nloans, and even banking, to broaden the product line it can sell to its \nvery large customer base.

A strategy \nof acquiring distressed companies or buying liquidated assets can \nimprove margins and create a low-cost position if the rate of techno-\nlogical change is not too great.

This straightforward ap-\nproach has been practiced, for example, by Crown Cork and Seal in \nmetal containers and crowns, and Massey-Ferguson in farm imple-\nments. Sometimes equipment that is obsolete in the home market \ncan be used quite effectively in international markets, greatly lower-\ning the costs of entry there. Or industry structure may be a great deal \nmore favorable internationally, with less sophisticated and powerful \nbuyers, fewer competitors, and the like. The drawbacks to this strat-\negy are the familiar risks of international competition and the fact \nthat it may only postpone maturity rather than deal with it. \nSHOULD TRANSITION BE ATTEMPTED AT ALL? \nIt should not be taken as given that the strategic shifts required \nto compete successfully in a maturing industry should be attempted \nat all, in view of the substantial and perhaps new types of resources \nand skills that may be required. The choice depends not only on re-\nsources but also on the number of other firms who have the capabil-\nity to keep playing in the industry, the expected duration of the tur-\nmoil in the industry while adjustments to maturity are made, and the \nfuture prospects for industry profits (which depend on future indus-\ntry structure). \nFor some companies, a disinvestment strategy may be better \nthan making further reinvestments with an uncertain payout—which \nis what Dean Foods has done in fluid milk. Emphasis at Dean has \nbeen on cost cutting and highly selective investments in cost-saving \nequipment rather than on expansion of market position. \nIndustry leaders may or may not be in the best position to make \nthe adjustments required by transition if they have substantial iner-\ntia built into their strategies and strong ties to the strategic require-\nments of the growth phase of the industry's development.

The turmoil caused by the transition period \nyields opportunities for the potential entrant provided long-run in-\ndustry structure is favorable. \nStrategic Pitfalls in Transition \nIn addition to failure to recognize the strategic implications of \ntransition described above, there is the tendency for firms to fall \nprey to some characteristic strategic pitfalls: \n1. A company's self-perceptions and its perception of the in-\ndustry. Companies develop perceptions or images of themselves and \ntheir relative capabilities (\"we are the quality leader\"; \"we provide \nsuperior customer service\"), which are reflected in the implicit as-\nsumptions that form the basis of their strategies (see Chapter 3). \nThese self-perceptions may be increasingly inaccurate as transition \nproceeds, buyers' priorities adjust, and competitors respond to new \nindustry conditions. Similarly, firms have assumptions about the in-\ndustry, competitors, buyers, and suppliers which may be invalidated \nby transition. Yet altering these assumptions, built up through ac-\ntual past experience, is sometimes a difficult process. \n2. Caught in the middle. The problem of being caught in the \nmiddle described in Chapter 2 is particularly acute in transition to \nmaturity. Transition often squeezes out the slack that has made this \nstrategy viable in the past. \n3. The cash trap—investments to build share in a mature mar-\nket. Cash should be invested in a business only with the expectation \nof being able to remove it later. In a mature, slow-growing industry, \nthe assumptions required to justify investing new cash in order to \nbuild market share are often heroic. Maturity of the industry works \nagainst increasing or maintaining margins long enough to recoup \ncash investments down the road, by making the present value of cash \ninflows justify the outflows. Thus businesses in maturity can be cash \ntraps, particularly when a firm is not in a strong market position but \nis attempting to build a large market share in a maturing market. \nThe odds are against it. \n",

Hertz may very well have had this problem in \nthe late 1960s, offering RCA much opportunity for achieving a prof-\nit turnaround in the mid-1970s. \n4. Giving up market share too easily in favor of short-run prof-\nits. In the face of the profit pressures in transition, there seems to be \na tendency for some companies to try to maintain the profitability of \nthe recent past—which is done at the expense of market share or by \nforegoing marketing, R&D, and other needed investments, which in \nturn hurts future market position. Unwillingness to accept lower \nprofits during transition can be seriously shortsighted if economies \nof scale will be significant in the mature industry. A period of lower \nprofits may be inevitable while industry rationalization occurs, and a \ncool head is necessary to avoid overreaction. \n5. Resentment and irrational reaction to price competition \n(\"we will not compete on price\"). It is often difficult for firms to ac-\ncept the need for price competition after a period in which it has not \nbeen necessary, and therefore, when avoiding it may have been a sa-\ncred rule. Some managements even view price competition as un-\nseemly or beneath their dignity. This can be a dangerous reaction to \ntransition, when a firm willing to price aggressively may be able to \ntake share that will be crucial to establishing a low-cost position for \nthe long run. \n6. Resentment and irrational reaction to changes in industry \npractices (\"they are hurting the industry\"). Changes in industry \npractices, such as marketing techniques, production methods, and \nthe nature of distributor contracts are often an inevitable part of \ntransition. They may be important to the industry's long-run poten-\ntial, but there is often resistance to them. Substitutions of machines \nfor hand methods are resisted, as they have been in some sporting \ngoods businesses, and firms are unwilling to begin aggressively mar-\nketing their products (\"marketing does not work in this industry; it \nrequires personal selling\"). And so on. Such resistance can put a \nfirm seriously behind in adapting to the new competitive environ-\nment. \n7.

Clinging to \"higher quality\" as an excuse for not meeting \naggressive pricing and marketing moves of competitors. High qual-\nity can be a crucial company strength, but quality differentials have \na tendency to erode as an industry matures (see Chapter 8). Even if \nthey remain, more knowledgeable buyers may be willing to trade \nquality for lower prices in a mature business where they have pur-\nchased the products before.

Reduced attention to introducing new products versus refin-\ning old ones may be necessary. Less \"creativity\" and more attention \nto detail and pragmatism is often what is needed in the mature bus-\niness. \nThese shifts in competitive focus obviously require changes in \norganizational structure and systems to support them. Systems de-\nsigned to highlight and control different areas of the business are \nnecessary. Tighter budgeting, stricter control, and new performance-\nbased incentive systems may well be required in the mature business, \nall more formal than those used previously.6 Control of financial as-\nsets such as inventory and accounts receivable may take on greater \nimportance. All these sorts of changes have been key to successful \ncompany turnarounds in industries such as nursing homes and recre-\national vehicles that have recently gone through transition. \nMore coordination across functions and among manufacturing \nfacilities must often occur for the company to be cost competitive. \nFor example, industry maturity means that regional plants hereto-\nfore operating independently may well have to be tied together and \nbetter coordinated, requiring not only new systems and procedures \nbut also major changes in the plant managers' jobs. \nThere can sometimes be resistance to changes along these lines. \nThe company that has prided itself on pioneering and on a high-\nquality product may find it very difficult to engage in \"distasteful\" \nprice competition and in aggressive marketing, as was discussed pre-\nviously.

Sacrificing quality for costs and close monitoring of costs are \nresisted. Furthermore, new reporting requirements, new controls, \nnew organizational relationships, and other changes are sometimes \nseen as a loss in personal autonomy and as a threat.

Yet in the more mature competitive environment, there is \nless growth, less glamour, less excitement, and the spirit of pioneer-\ning and uniqueness tends to fade. This development raises a number \nof extremely difficult problems for general management. \n1. Scaled down expectations for financial performance. The \nstandards for acceptable growth and profits must often be reduced \nin managers' minds. If managers try to meet the old standards, they \nmay take actions that are extremely dysfunctional for the long-run \nhealth of the company in the mature market unless it has an extreme-\nly strong market position. The scaling-down process is difficult be-\ncause a strong tradition of achieving financial results may have been \nbuilt up through past successes by the organization.

These new skills are both \nstrategic and administrative, and thus the adaptation is doubly diffi-\ncult.8 Finally, the mood or feeling of excitement and pioneering the \ngeneral manager has felt in the past may give way to one of increas-\ning pressure to keep up and concern for survival. Often a sort of \nmalaise appears. \nThus transition to maturity is often a difficult period for a gen-\neral manager, particularly for the founding entrepreneur but not ex-\nclusively so. Some unfortunate but common outcomes are as \nfollows: \n• Denies transition: The general manager fails to recognize and \naccept the changes required or lacks the required skills. As a \nresult, the historical strategy and organizational arrange-\nments are doggedly continued. This sort of rigidity is a com-\nmon reaction to strategic difficulty not only during transition \nbut also in other adverse company situations.9 \n• Leaves active management: Recognizing that either the new \nway of life in the company is no longer satisfactory or that his \nor her managerial skills are inadequate for the new environ-\nment, the general manager relinquishes control. \nThe implication of industry transition for the general manager \ncarries an important message not only for the general manager him-\nself but also for the corporate management of diversified compan-\nies. The standards for measuring business unit managers usually \nneed to change in a mature business, as do the skills and orientation \nof the general manager. It may be, for these reasons, that rotation of \nmanagers is appropriate as a division enters maturity. There is a ten-\ndency in diversified companies to apply the same standards to divi-\nsion managers regardless of their fundamentally different strategic \nsituations and to expect managers skilled in one setting to manage \nwell in another. Attention to the managerial implications of transi-\ntion to maturity is one way to avoid these difficulties. \n'In the classic transition from an entrepreneurally to professionally managed \ncompany, the adaptation in skills required of the general manager is largely along \norganizational and administrative lines only. \n'See Porter (1976b). \n",

There have always been industries in \ndecline, but the prevalence of this difficult structural environment \nhas probably increased with slower world economic growth, product \nsubstitution resulting from rapid cost inflation, and continued tech-\nnological change in areas like electronics, computers, and chemicals. \nAlthough deceptively familiar as a phase of the product life cycle, \ndeclining industries have not received much study. The decline phase \nof a business is characterized in the life-cycle model as one of shrink-\ning margins, pruning product lines, falling R&D and advertising, \nand a dwindling number of competitors.

The product portfolio models in \ncommon use for planning today yield the same advice for declining \nindustries: Do not invest in slow or negative-growth, unfavorable \nmarkets but pull cash out. \nHowever, in-depth study of a wide spectrum of declining indus-\ntries suggests that the nature of competition during decline as well as \nthe strategic alternatives available to firms for coping with decline \nare a great deal more complex. Industries differ markedly in the way \ncompetition responds to decline; some industries age gracefully, \nwhereas others are characterized by bitter warfare, prolonged excess \ncapacity, and heavy operating losses. Successful strategies vary just \nas widely. Some firms have reaped high returns from strategies ac-\ntually involving heavy reinvestment in a declining industry that make \ntheir businesses better cash cows later.

If firms \nbelieve that demand might revitalize or level off, they will probably \ntry to hold onto their positions and remain in the industry. Their ef-\nforts to maintain position despite shrinking sales will have a high \nprobability of leading to bitter warfare. This situation has been oc-\ncurring in the rayon industry, where there have been continued and \nprobably justified hopes that rayon's losses to nylon and steel in the \ntire cord market, and losses to other fibers in the textile market, \ncould be reversed. On the other hand, if all firms are certain that in-\ndustry demand will continue to decline, it will facilitate the process \nof withdrawing capacity from the market in an orderly fashion. In \nacetylene, for example, it became quickly clear that the skyrocketing \ncost of natural gas would make ethylene a lower-cost substitute for \nmany of the chemical processes using acetylene. Here the least effi-\ncient firms began early to develop strategies for withdrawal. \nFirms may well differ in their perceptions of future demand; \nsome firms may foresee a higher probability of revitalization, and \nthese firms will be prone to hang on. Furthermore, there is some evi-\ndence in case histories of declining industries that a firm's perception \nof the likelihood of future decline is influenced by its position in the \nindustry and its exit barriers. The stronger the firm's position or the \nhigher the exit barriers it faces in leaving, the more optimism seems \nto exist in its projections of the future. \nRATE AND PATTERN OF DECLINE \nThe more slowly decline is proceeding, the more it may be \nmasked by short-run factors in firms' analyses of their positions, \n",

Un-\ncertainty greatly increases the volatility of this phase. If demand is \ndeclining precipitously, on the other hand, firms have a hard time in \njustifying optimistic future projections. In addition, large declines in \nsales make abandonments of whole plants or divestiture of whole di-\nvisions more likely, which can rapidly adjust industry capacity \ndownward. The smoothness of decline also plays a part in uncertain-\nty. If the industry's sales are inherently erratic such as in rayon and \nacetate, it may be difficult to separate the downward trend in sales \nfrom the confusion caused by period-to-period fluctuations. \nThe rate of decline is partly a function of the pattern in which \nfirms actually decide to withdraw capacity from the business. In \nindustrial businesses whose product is an important input to cus-\ntomers, demand can decline precipitously if one or two major pro-\nducers decide to withdraw. Customers fear for the continued avail-\nability of a key input, and they are prone to shift to a substitute more \nquickly than otherwise. So firms that announce exit early can strong-\nly influence the rate of decline. The rate also has a tendency to accel-\nerate as decline proceeds because shrinking volume raises costs and \nperhaps prices. \nSTRUCTURE OF REMAINING DEMAND POCKETS \nAs demand declines, the nature of the pockets of demand that \nremain plays a major role in determining the profitability of the re-\nmaining competitors. These may offer more or less favorable pros-\npects for profitability, based on a complete structural analysis like \nthat outlined in Chapter 1. For example, one of the major remaining \npockets of demand in the cigar industry is the premium segment. \nThis segment is quite immune to substitution, has price-insensitive \nbuyers, and is amenable to the creation of high levels of product dif-\nferentiation. The firms that can maintain a position in this segment \nare well placed to earn above-average returns, even as the industry \ndeclines, because they can defend their positions from competitive \nforces. In the leather industry, upholstery leathers have been a sur-\nviving pocket in which technology and differentiation have the same \neffect. In acetylene, on the other hand, the market segments where \nacetylene has not been displaced by ethylene are threatened by still \nother substitutes, and in those markets acetylene is a commodity \nproduct subject to price warfare because of its high fixed manufac-\nturing costs. Thus profit potential in the remaining pockets is pretty \ndismal. \n",

The profitability of the end game \nwill also depend on the vulnerability of remaining pockets of de-\nmand to substitutes and to powerful suppliers, as well as the pres-\nence of mobility barriers, which protect firms serving the remaining \nsegments from attack by firms seeking to replace sales lost in disap-\npearing segments. \nCAUSES OF DECLINE \nIndustry demand declines for a number of different reasons, \nwhich have implications for competition during the decline phase: \nTechnological Substitution. One source of decline is substitute \nproducts created through technological innovation (electronic calcu-\nlators for sliderules) or made prominent by shifts in relative costs \nand quality (synthetics for leather). This source can be threatening to \nindustry profits because increasing substitution usually depresses \nprofits at the same time it cuts into sales. This negative effect on \nprofits is mitigated if there are pockets of demand in the industry \nthat are immune or resistant to the substitute and have favorable \ncharacteristics in the sense previously described. Substitution may or \nmay not be accompanied by uncertainty over future demand, de-\npending on the industry. \nDemographics. Another source of decline is shrinkage in the \nsize of the customer group that purchases the product. In industrial \nbusinesses, demographics cause decline by reducing demand in \ndownstream industries. Demographics as a source of decline is not \naccompanied by the competitive pressure of a substitute product. \nThus if capacity can leave the industry affected by demographics in \nan orderly way, surviving firms may have profit prospects compar-\nable to those before decline. However, demographic shifts are often \nsubject to great uncertainty, which is destabilizing for competition in \ndecline as has been discussed. \n",

For example, \ncigar consumption has fallen in large part because of cigars' plum-\nmeting social acceptability. Like demographics, shifts in needs do \nnot necessarily lead to increased pressure of substitutes for remain-\ning sales. However, shifts in needs can also be subject to great uncer-\ntainties, like those in cigars, which have led many firms to continue \nto forecast a resurgence of demand. This situation is very threaten-\ning to profitability in decline. \nThe cause of decline, then, gives clues about the probable de-\ngree of uncertainty firms perceive about future demand as well as \nsome indications about the profitability of serving the remaining \nsegments. \nEXIT BARRIERS \nCrucial to competition in declining industries is the manner in \nwhich capacity leaves the market. Just as there are barriers to entry, \nhowever, there are exit barriers which keep firms competing in de-\nclining industries even though they are earning subnormal returns on \ninvestment. The higher the exit barriers, then, the less hospitable the \nindustry will be to the firms that remain during decline. \nExit barriers stem from a number of fundamental sources: \nDURABLE AND SPECIALIZED ASSETS \nIf the assets of a business, either fixed or working capital or \nboth, are highly specialized to the particular business, company, or \nlocation in which they are being used, this creates exit barriers by di-\nminishing the liquidation value of the firm's investment in the busi-\nness. Specialized assets either must be sold to someone who intends \nto use them in the same business (and if they are specialized enough, \nto use them in the same location) or their value is greatly diminished \nand they must often be scrapped. The number of buyers wishing to \nuse the assets in the same business is usually few, because the same \nreasons that make the firm want to sell its assets in a declining mar-\nket will probably discourage potential buyers. For example, an acet-\nylene manufacturing complex or a rayon plant has such specialized \nequipment that it must be sold to another owner for the same use or \nscrapped.

Once the acetylene and rayon industries began to de-\ncline, the potential buyers willing to continue to operate the plants \nup for sale were close to nonexistent; those plants that were sold \nwere sold at enormous discounts to book value and often to specula-\ntors or desperate employee groups. Inventory in a declining industry \nmay also be worth very little, particularly if it normally turns over \nvery slowly. \nIf the liquidation value of the assets of a business is low, it is \neconomically optimal for the firm to remain in the business even if \nthe expected discounted future cash flows are low. If the assets are \ndurable, the book value may greatly exceed the liquidation value. \nThus it is possible for a firm to earn a book loss but it be economi-\ncally appropriate to remain in the business because the discounted \ncash flows exceeded the opportunity cost of capital on the invest-\nment that could be released if the business were divested. Divesting \nthe business in any situation in which the book value exceeds the li-\nquidation value also leads to a write-off, which has some deterring \neffects on exit that will be discussed later. \nIn assessing the exit barriers caused by asset specialization in a \nparticular business, the question is whether or not there are any mar-\nkets for the assets as, or as part of, a going concern. Sometimes as-\nsets can be sold to overseas markets at a different stage of economic \ndevelopment, even though they have little value in the home country. \nThis move raises the liquidation value and lowers exit barriers. \nWhether there are overseas markets or not, however, the value of \nspecialized assets will usually diminish as it becomes increasingly \nclear that the industry is declining. For example, Raytheon, which \nsold its vacuum tube-making assets in the early 1960s when tube de-\nmand was strong for color TV sets, recovered a much higher liquida-\ntion value than the firms that tried to unload their vacuum tube facil-\nities in the early 1970s, after the industry was clearly in its twilight \nyears. Few, if any, U.S. producers were interested in purchasing by \nthis later time, and foreign firms supplying vacuum tubes to less ad-\nvanced economies either had already purchased tube-making equip-\nment or were in a much stronger bargaining position once U.S. de-\ncline was obvious. \nFIXED COSTS OF EXIT \nOften substantial fixed costs of exiting elevate exit barriers by \nreducing the effective liquidation value of a business.

The costly full-time ef-\nforts of a number of skilled managers, attorneys, and accountants \nwill usually be consumed for a significant period when a company is \ndivesting. Provision must sometimes be made for maintaining avail-\nability of spare parts to past customers after exit; this requirement \ninvolves incurring a loss which, discounted, becomes a fixed cost of \nexiting. Management or employees may need to be resettled and/or \nretrained. Breaking long-term contracts to purchase inputs or sell \nproducts may involve substantial cancellation penalties, if they can \nbe abrogated at all. In many cases the firm must pay the cost of hav-\ning another firm fulfill such contracts. \nThere are often also hidden costs of exit.

Even where government does not become \ninvolved formally, community pressure and informal political pres-\nsure not to exit can be very high, depending on the situation in which \nthe company finds itself. \nClosely akin is the social concern that many managements feel \nfor their employees and local communities, which may not translate \ninto dollars and cents but is nonetheless real. Divestment often \nmeans putting people out of work, and it can mean crippling a local \neconomy. Such concerns often interplay with emotional barriers to \nexit. In Quebec, for example, there has been tremendous social con-\ncern about closing down pulp mills in the depressed Canadian dis-\nsolving pulp industry, many of which are in one-company towns. \nExecutives are torn with concern for communities, and formal and \ninformal government pressure has been brought to bear as well.7 \nBecause of any or all of these types of exit barriers, a firm may \ncontinue to compete in an industry even though its financial per-\nformance is subnormal.

In a declin-\ning industry with high exit barriers, it is difficult even for the \nstrongest and healthiest firms to avoid being hurt in the process of \ndecline. \nMECHANISM FOR ASSET DISPOSITION \nThe manner in which the assets of firms are disposed of can \nstrongly influence the potential profitability of a declining industry. \nIn the Canadian dissolving pulp industry, for example, a major \nplant was not retired but sold to a group of entrepreneurs at a signif-\nicant discount to book value. With a lower investment base, man-\nagers of the new entity could make decisions on pricing and other \naspects of strategy that were rational for them but which severely \ncrippled the remaining firms. Selling the assets to the employees at a \ndiscount can have the same effect. Thus if assets in a declining indus-\ntry are disposed of within the industry and not then retired, it is even \nworse for subsequent competition than if the original owners of the \nfirms stayed in business. \nThe situation in which government subsidies keep ailing firms \nalive in declining industries is nearly as bad. Not only does capacity \nnot leave the market, but also the subsidized firm can depress profit \n'For an in-depth discussion of the role of government in this declining industry, see \nMehta(1978). \n",

Warfare among the firms that remain will be \nmost intense in the decline phase in the following situations: \n• the product is perceived as a commodity; \n• fixed costs are high; \n• many firms are locked by exit barriers into the industry; \n• a number of firms perceive a high strategic importance in \nmaintaining their position in the industry; \n• the relative strengths of remaining firms are relatively \nbalanced so that one or a few firms cannot easily win the \ncompetitive battle; \n• firms are uncertain about their relative competitive strengths \nand many attempt ill-fated efforts at changing position. \nThe volatility of rivalry in decline can be accentuated by sup-\npliers and distribution channels. The industry becomes a less impor-\ntant customer to suppliers as it declines, which may affect prices and \nservice.8 Similarly, the power of channels will increase as the indus-\ntry declines if distribution channels handle multiple firms, control \nshelf space and shelf positioning, or can influence the ultimate cus-\ntomer's purchase decision. In cigars, for example, shelf positioning \nis crucial to success since cigars are an impulse item. The power of \ndistribution channels for cigars has increased markedly during the \nindustry's decline, and sellers' margins have correspondingly fallen. \nPerhaps the worst situation from the standpoint of industry ri-\nvalry during decline is the situation in which one or two firms are rel-\natively weak in terms of their strategic position in the industry, but \nthey possess significant overall corporate resources and a strong \nstrategic commitment to stay in the business.

Other common \nharvest tactics include the following: \n• reducing the number of models; \n• shrinking the number of channels employed; \n• eliminating small customers; \n• eroding service in terms of delivery time (inventory), speed of \nrepair, or sales assistance. \nUltimately the business is sold or liquidated. \nAll businesses are not readily harvestable.

Selling the business early usually max-\nimizes the value the firm can realize from the sale of the business, be-\ncause the earlier the business is sold, the greater is the uncertainty \nabout whether demand will indeed subsequently decline and the \nmore likely other markets for the assets, like foreign countries, are \nnot glutted. \nIn some situations it may be desirable to divest the business \nbefore decline, or in the maturity phase.

The key strengths and weaknesses of the firm in determin-\ning its relative position are not necessarily those that have counted \nearlier in the industry's development; instead they relate to the seg-\nments or pockets of demand that will remain and the particular con-\nditions of the decline phase in terms of the nature of rivalry.

Postponing a \nchoice of decline strategy tends to eliminate the polar options and \nforces the firm toward either niche or harvest. \nA key part of strategy in declining industries, particularly ag-\ngressive strategies, is to find ways to encourage particular competi-\ntors out of the industry.

There are a number of \ndistinct sources of such global strategic advantage, as well as impedi-\nments to achieving them.2 The task for the analyst is to assess these \nitems for the particular industry under study, understanding either \nwhy it is not global or, conversely, which sources of global advan-\ntage have outweighted the impediments. \nSOURCES OF GLOBAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE \nThe sources of global advantage stem broadly from four causes: \nconventional comparative advantage, economies of scale or learning \ncurves extending beyond the scale or cumulative volume achievable \nin individual national markets, advantages from product differentia-\ntion, and the public-good character of market information and tech-\nnology:3 \nComparative Advantage. The existence of comparative ad-\nvantage is a classic determinant of global competition. When a coun-\ntry or countries have significant advantages in factor cost or factor \nquality used in producing a product, these countries will be the sites \nof production and exports will flow to other parts of the world. In \nsuch industries, the strategic position of the global firm in those \ncountries possessing a comparative advantage is crucial to its world \nposition. \nProduction Economies of Scale. If there are economies of \nscale in production (or providing service) that extend beyond the size \nof major national markets, the firm can potentially achieve a cost \nadvantage through centralized production and global competition. \nFor example, modern high-speed steel mills have a minimum effi-\ncient scale that appears to be as much as 40 percent of worldwide de-\nmand. Sometimes advantages of vertical integration are the key to \nachieving global production economies, because the efficient scale of \nthe vertically integrated system is greater than the size of national \nmarkets. Achieving production economies necessarily implies move-\nment of exports among countries. \n2These parallel, albeit on a different level, the causes of industry fragmentation and \nways of overcoming them discussed in Chapter 9. \n3A public good, such as a technological innovation, is something that can be used \nrepeatedly at no cost once the initial investment has been made. \n",

In technologies subject to significant cost \ndeclines due to proprietary experience, the ability to sell similar \nproduct varieties in many national markets can bring benefits. Cum-\nulative volume per model is greater if the model is sold in many na-\ntional markets, leading to a cost advantage for the global competi-\ntor. This situation has probably occurred in the manufacture of \nlight-duty lift trucks, in which Toyota has gained a commanding po-\nsition. Global competition can allow faster learning, even if the \nlearning curve flattens at cumulative volumes achievable eventually \nby competing in an individual geographic market. Since a company \npotentially can gain experience by sharing improvements among \nplants, a cost advantage from global competition potentially can be \ngained even if production is not centralized but takes place in each \nnational market. \nLogistical Economies of Scale. \nIf an international logistics \nsystem inherently involves fixed costs that can be spread by supply-\ning many national markets, the global competitor has a potential \ncost advantage.

The most ob-\nvious are in industries in which a common sales force is deployed \nworldwide. In heavy construction and in the manufacture of aircraft \nor turbine generators, for example, the sales task is highly complex \nand is carried out infrequently with relatively few buyers.

The McDonald's \"formula\" \nor Timex's \"torture test\" marketing campaign have worked world-\nwide, for example. Some brand names have carryover among geo-\ngraphic markets, although usually the firm must invest to establish \nits brand name in each one. However, some brand names develop \nrecognition internationally through trade press, technical literature, \ncultural prominence, or other reasons that do not require invest-\nments by the firm. \nEconomies of Scale in Purchasing. When there are opportun-\nities to achieve economies of scale in purchasing as a result of bar-\ngaining power or lower suppliers' cost in producing long runs, which \ngo beyond what is needed to compete in individual national markets, \nthe global firm will have a potential cost advantage. For example, \nworldwide producers of television sets appear to be able to purchase \ntransistors and diodes at lower costs. Such an advantage is most \nprobable when the volumes purchased by the industry are moderate \ncompared to the size of the industry producing the raw materials or \ncomponents; if purchases are large, most bargaining leverage may \nwell have been exhausted. If the firm is engaged directly in raw mate-\nrial extraction (minerals) or production (agricultural products), the \npotential advantage is similar. If the efficient scale of mine for a par-\nticular mineral is greater than the firm's need for that mineral to \ncompete in a large national market, for example, the firm that mines \nat efficient scale and competes globally will have a cost advantage. \nHowever, the need to compete globally to achieve this advantage \npresupposes that the firm cannot mine at efficient scale and then sell \nexcess minerals to other firms. \nProduct Differentiation. In some businesses, particularly \ntechnologically progressive ones, global competition can give the \nfirm an edge in reputation and credibility. In the high-fashion cos-\nmetics industry, for example, a firm significantly benefits from a \npresence in Paris, London, and New York in order to have the image \nto compete successfully in Japan. \nProprietary Product Technology. Global economies can result \nfrom the ability to apply proprietary technology in several national \nmarkets. This ability is particularly important when economies of \nscale in research are large relative to the sales of individual national \nmarkets.

Global \ncompetition can also give the firm a series of taps into technological \ndevelopments worldwide which can improve its technological com-\npetitiveness. \nMobility of Production. An important special case of econo-\nmies due to scale and sharing of proprietary technology arises where \nthe production of a product or service is mobile. For example, in \nheavy construction the firm moves its crew from country to country \nto build projects; oil tankers can carry oil anywhere in the world; \nseismic crews, oil rigs, and consultants are also mobile. In such in-\ndustries, fixed costs of creating and maintaining an organization and \ndeveloping proprietary technology can be readily spread over opera-\ntions in many national markets. In addition, the firm can invest in \nskilled people or mobile equipment whose employment would not be \njustified by the demand for the product in any one national mar-\nket—hence another example of economies of scale exceeding single-\nmarket size. \nOften the sources of global advantage occur in combination, \nand there can be interactions among them. For example, production \neconomies can provide the basis for invasion of foreign markets, \nwhich then leads to logistical economies or those from purchasing. \nThe significance of each source of global advantage clearly de-\npends on one of two things. First, how significant to total cost is the \naspect of the business subject to global economies? Second, how sig-\nnificant to competition is the aspect of the business in which the glo-\nbal competitor has an edge? An advantage in an area that represents \na fairly low percentage of total costs (e.g., sales force) can still be ex-\ntremely important to competitive success or failure in some indus-\ntries. In this case, even a small improvement in cost or effectiveness \nbrought about by global competition can be significant. \nIt is also important to note that all the sources of advantage also \nimply the presence of mobility barriers for global firms.

Even when the advantages of \nglobal competition outweigh the impediments overall, the impedi-\nments can still yield viable strategic niches for national firms that do \nnot compete globally. Some of these impediments are economic and \nraise the direct cost of competing globally. Others do not necessarily \naffect cost directly but raise the complexity of the managerial task.5 \nA third category relates to purely institutional or governmental re-\nstraints that do not reflect economic circumstances. Finally, some \nimpediments can relate solely to perceptual or resource limitations \nof industry incumbents.6 \nECONOMIC IMPEDIMENTS \nTransportation and Storage Costs. Transport or storage costs \noffset economies of centralized production, as well as the efficiency \nof production in an integrated system involving specialized plants in \na number of countries and transshipment. For products like pre-\nstressed concrete, hazardous chemicals, and fertilizer, high transport \ncosts mean that plants must be built in each market, even though \nproduction costs alone might be reduced by plants whose scale ex-\nceeds individual national market needs. Competition is essentially \non a market-by-market basis. \nDiffering Product Needs. Global competition is impeded \nwhen national markets demand different product varieties. Because \nof differences in culture, state of economic development, income \nlevels, climate, and so on, national markets might demand product \nvarieties differing in trade-offs among cost, quality, and perform-\nance; in style; in size; and in other dimensions. For example, al-\nthough computerized sewing machines are being sold in the United \nStates and Western Europe, simpler pedal-powered varieties ade-\nquately meet the needs of the developing world. Different legal stric-\ntures, building codes, or technical standards might also compel dif-\nferent varieties to be demanded in different national markets even \nthough intrinsic product needs were otherwise the same. The need to \nproduce differing varieties impedes the achievement of global econ-\nomies of scale or learning. It may also impede benefits from global \n5The presence of these impediments in extreme form can mean that an industry is \nactually regional rather than national. \n'This discussion focuses on the particular impediments to competition globally. \nThe firm seeking entry into international markets must of course overcome the \nfull range of entry barriers discussed elsewhere in this book. \n",

If required product differences are cosmetic or can other-\nwise be accommodated without significant cost in an otherwise stan-\ndard production process, the global firm can still reap most of the \nglobal economies of scale. \nEstablished Distribution Channels. The need to gain access to \ndistribution channels in each national market can impede global \ncompetition. When customers are numerous and individual purchase \namounts are small, the firm may well require access to already estab-\nlished independent stocking distributors to compete successfully. In \nelectrical products, for example, any individual item, such as a load \ncenter or circuit breaker, is too small a sale to justify in-house distri-\nbution. In such situations it can be very difficult for a foreign firm to \npenetrate entrenched distribution channels. The channels have little \nincentive to substitute a foreign firm's line for a domestic one unless \na significant (and perhaps prohibitive) concession is made. If distri-\nbution channels are less well established because the industry is new \nor in flux, this bottleneck may not be so great. Also, if much volume \nmoves through a few channels, the foreign firm may have a better \nchance of gaining access than if it must convince many small chan-\nnels to take on its line. \nSales Force. If the product requires a local manufacturer's di-\nrect sales force, the international competitor confronts a potential \nscale economy barrier, most severe if national competitors' sales \nforces sell a wide line of products. This factor may be impeding \nfuther globalization in industries such as medical products in which \ncostly detailing to doctors is required. \nLocal Repair. The need to offer local manufacturer's repair \ncan impede the international competitor in much the same way as the \nneed for a local sales force. \nSensitivity to Lead Times.

This problem is accentuated if local product needs \ndiffer. \nA related issue is the lead time required to physically transport \ngoods globally. This lead time generally translates to cost, since in \ntheory every good could be airshipped, although possibly at prohibi-\ntive expense. The point is that even though the cost of moving a \nproduct by a low-cost means might not preclude global shipment, \nthe lead times involved are too great to allow the responsiveness de-\nmanded by the market. \nComplex Segmentation Within Geographic Markets. Com-\nplex price-performance trade-offs among competing brands by cus-\ntomers in national markets have the same basic effect as national \nproduct variety differences in impeding global competition. Com-\nplex segmentation increases even more the need for product lines \nwith many varieties or the ability to produce custom products. De-\npending on the cost of producing additional varieties, it may effec-\ntively preclude cost advantages from centralization of production in \nan integrated manufacturing system. The local firm will be well \nsuited to perceive and adapt to the various segments of the local \nmarket. \nLack of World Demand. Global competition cannot occur if \ndemand does not exist in a significant number of major countries. \nThis situation could be present because the industry was new or be-\ncause the product or service only fit the needs of an unusual cus-\ntomer group which was present in only a few national markets. \nThat industry newness might imply a lack of world demand fol-\nlows from the so-called product life cycle of international trade.' \nThis concept holds that products are initially introduced in markets \nwhere their attributes have the greatest value (e.g., labor-saving in-\nnovations in high-wage countries).

Overseas production by foreign firms may also begin once de-\nmand spreads abroad and technology diffuses. Upon maturity of the \nindustry and subsequent product standardization and price competi-\ntion, overseas firms may take prominent positions in the industry, \n'For further discussion of this concept see Vernon (1966); Wells (1972). \ni \n",

All these argu-\nments suggest that generally some degree of maturity is necessary for \nglobal competition to be present, although it seems clear that less \nmaturity is necessary today than a decade ago because of the preva-\nlence of multinational competitors with experience in global compe-\ntition who can rapidly diffuse new products globally.8 \nMANAGERIAL IMPEDIMENTS \nDiffering Marketing Tasks. Even if globally sold product va-\nrieties are similar, the marketing task can vary geographically. The \nnature of distribution channels, marketing media, and cost effective \nmeans of reaching the buyer can differ so much from country to \ncountry that the global competitors not only are unable to exploit \nmarketing knowledge from other markets but also have a great deal \nof difficulty being as effective at local marketing as local competi-\ntors. Although there is no reason why a global competitor could not \nhave centralized production and/or R&D combined with local mar-\nketing, in practice it may be difficult to manage. In some businesses, \nthere may also be a customer bias toward dealing with local firms for \na variety of reasons. \nIntensive Local Services. Where intensive localized marketing, \nservice, or other customer interaction is required to compete in the \nindustry, the firm can find it tough to operate on an integrated, glo-\nbal basis in competition with local rivals. Although a global firm \ncould conceivably perform these functions through decentralized \nunits, in practice the managerial task is so complex that the local \nfirm can be more responsive. Where intensive local marketing and \ndistribution (not subject to global economies) are crucial, the bene-\nfits achieved by other centralized activities of the global firm can be \noutweighed by the local firm. Even though a global metal fabricator \nmight gain some production and technological benefits of multina-\ntional operations, for example, the need for intensive local market-\ning, responsive service, and quick turnaround means that the local \nfirm can equal or outperform the global one. \nRapidly Changing Technology.

If distribu-\ntion channels are in flux, the burden of foreign firms gaining access \nto them may be eased. Rationalized channels may have the same ef-\nfect. For example, if distribution for a product shifts from many \nfragmented retailers to a few national department stores and mass \nmerchandiser chains, the problem of gaining distribution facing the \nforeign firm may shrink dramatically. \nChanged Factor Costs. Shifts in factor costs can strongly en-\nhance the sources of globalization. Increases in the cost of labor, en-\nergy, and raw materials can shift the optimum production or distri-\nbution configuration in ways that make global competition more \nbeneficial. \nNarrowed National Economic and Social Circumstances. The \nneed for differing product varieties and marketing tasks and the \nproblems of obtaining local distribution stem in part from differ-\nences in the state of economic circumstances of different geographic \nmarkets. They differ in their state of economic development, relative \nfactor costs, income level, nature of distribution channels, available \nmarketing media, and so on. As geographic markets become more \nsimilar in their economic and cultural circumstances as they relate \nto a particular industry, the potential for world competition in-\ncreases, provided sources of global advantage are present in the in-\ndustry.

Sometimes national product differences erode natu-\nrally as the industry matures and products become standardized. \nHowever, firms can redesign products to make them acceptable in \nmany markets, as General Motors and other firms are doing with the \n\"world car.\" In other cases, a marketing innovation which redefines \nthe image or concept of the product is sometimes instrumental in un-\nlocking possibilities for global competition. For example, Honda re-\ndefined the image of a motorcycle in the United States to a practical, \neasy to ride, clean-cut mode of transportation and away from the \nimage of a greasy, powerful, threatening device ridden by leather-\njacketed hoods. With new U.S. volume to combine with Japanese \nvolume, Honda was able to reap substantial global economies of \nscale in motorcycle production.

Global industries \nare characterized by the presence of competitors operating world-\nwide from home bases in different countries. Particularly outside of \nthe United States, firms and their home governments must be re-\ngarded together in competitor analysis. The two have complex rela-\ntionships which can involve many forms of regulation, subsidy, and \nother assistance.

A consequence of all this support is that barriers to \nexit may well increase. \nCompetitor analysis is impossible in world industries without a \nthorough examination of the relationships between firms and home \ncountries. The home country's industrial policy must be well under-\nstood, as well as the political and economic relations of the home \ngovernment vis-à-vis governments in major world markets for the \nindustry's product. \nIt is often true that competition in world industries is distorted \nby political considerations which may or may not be related to the \neconomics involved. Purchases of aircraft, defense products, or \ncomputers may depend as much on the political relations between \nhome countries and buying countries as they do on the relative mer-\nits of one firm's product against another's. This factor implies not \nonly that the competitor in a global industry needs a high degree of \ninformation about political matters but also that the firm's particu-\nlar relationships with its home government and governments in buy-\ning countries become truly strategic in importance.

In some industries they are major buyers, whereas in \nothers their influence is more indirect but potentially as strong. \nWhere host governments are prone to exercise their power, they can \neither block global competition altogether or create a number of dif-\nferent strategic groups in an industry. Studies by Doz have identified \nthree groups.9 The first consists of firms competing globally on a co-\nordinated basis; the second, of multinational companies (often with \nsmaller market shares) that follow a strategy of local responsiveness \nrather than integration. These firms escape many government im-\npediments and may actually receive host government support. Final-\n'Doz (1979). \n",

For international com-\npanies, the degree of responsiveness to host government concerns \nbecomes a key strategic variable. I will describe the broad alterna-\ntives to competing globally in some detail below. \nThe firm trying to compete globally may need to compete in cer-\ntain major markets to gain necessary economies. For example, it \nmay need the volume of certain major markets in order to fulfill a \nglobal manufacturing strategy. It must therefore concern itself stra-\ntegically with protecting its position in those markets that affect its \nability to implement the global strategy as a whole. This requirement \ngives the host governments in these countries bargaining power, and \nthe firm may have to make concessions in order to preserve the \nwhole strategy. For example, Japanese firms in the television and \nautomobile industries may have to manufacture partly in the United \nStates, to appease U.S. political concerns, in order to maintain the \nU.S. volume that is a key source of their global competitive advan-\ntage.

A global industry, by definition, is one \nin which firms view competition as global and build strategies ac-\ncordingly. Thus competition involves a coordinated worldwide pat-\ntern of market positions, facilities, and investments. The global stra-\ntegies of competitors will usually involve only partial overlap in \nserved markets, geographic location of plants, and so on. In main-\ntaining a competitive balance from a systemic viewpoint, it may be \nnecessary for firms to make defensive investments in particular mar-\nkets and locations so as not to let competitors reap advantages that \ncan be factored into their overall global posture. Knickerbocker's \nstudy of international competition found much evidence of this pat-\ntern of behavior.\" \nDifficulty in Competitor Analysis. Although the same sorts of \nfactors as described in Chapter 3 are important in analyzing inter-\nnational competitors, this analysis is difficult in global industries \nbecause of the prevalence of foreign firms and the need to analyze \nsystemic relationships. Data on foreign firms are generally less avail-\nable than on U.S. firms, although the differences are narrowing. \n\"For a discussion of IBM see Doz (in press). \n\"Knickerbocker (1973). \n",

They believe that it is cheaper, less risky, or eas-\nier to coordinate when these functions are performed internally. \nMany vertical integration decisions are framed in terms of the \n\"make or buy\" decision, focusing on the financial calculations such \na decision entails.1 That is, they are preoccupied with estimating the \ncost savings of integration and balancing them with the investment \nrequired. However, the vertical integration decision is much broader \nthan this. The essence of the vertical integration decision is not the \nfinancial calculation itself but rather the numbers that serve as the \nraw material for the calculation.

Clearly their importance varies from firm to \nfirm in an industry, depending on each firm's strategy and its \nstrengths and weaknesses.

In some circumstances it can provide close familiarity \nwith technology in upstream or downstream businesses that is cru-\ncial to the success of the base business, a form of economy of infor-\nmation so important as to deserve separate treatment. For example, \nmany mainframe computer and minicomputer firms have instituted \nbackward integration into semiconductor design and manufacturing \nto gain a better understanding of this essential technology. Manufac-\nturers of components in many areas integrate forward into systems \nto develop a sophisticated understanding of how the components are \nused.

Integration only assures demand \nto the extent that the downstream unit can absorb the output of the \nupstream unit. The ability of the downstream unit to do so clearly \ndepends on the effect of competitive conditions on the demand of \nthe downstream unit. If demand is down in the downstream indus-\ntry, the sales of the internal unit may also be low, and its needs for \nthe output of its internal supplier corresponding low. Thus integra-\ntion may only reduce the uncertainty that the firm will be arbitrarily \ncut off by its customers rather than assure demand in the literal \nsense. \nAlthough vertical integration can reduce the uncertainty of sup-\nply and demand, and hedge the firm against fluctuations in prices, \nthis does not mean that internal transfer prices should not reflect \nmarket disturbances. Products should pass from unit to unit within \nthe integrated company at transfer prices reflecting market prices to \ninsure that each unit will manage its business properly. If transfer \nprices diverge from market prices, one unit will be subsidizing the \nother compared to what it could achieve on the open market (one \nunit will be better off and the other worse off).

Offsetting bargaining \npower through integration may not only lower costs of supply (by \nbackward integration) or raise price realization (by forward integra-\ntion) but also allow the firm to operate more efficiently by eliminat-\ning otherwise valueless practices used to cope with the powerful sup-\npliers or customers.

Internalizing the profits earned by suppliers of an \ninput can reveal the true costs of that input. The firm then has the \nchoice of adjusting the price of its final product to maximize overall \nprofits of the two entities before integration.

The more significant the net benefits of integration, the \ngreater the pressure on other firms to also integrate. If there are sig-\nnificant economies of scale or capital requirements barriers to inte-\ngration, the compulsion to integrate will raise mobility barriers in \nthe industry. If scale economies and capital requirements are not sig-\nnificant, on the other hand, then the compulsion to be integrated will \nhave little competitive significance. \nENTER A HIGHER-RETURN BUSINESS \nA firm may sometimes increase its overall return on investment \nby vertically integrating. If the stage of production into which inte-\ngration is being contemplated has a structure that offers a return on \ninvestment greater than the opportunity cost of capital for the firm, \nthen it is profitable to integrate even if there are no economies of in-\ntegration per se. Of course the integrating firm must include the cost \nof overcoming entry barriers into the adjacent stage in its calculation \nabout the return on investment to be earned in the adjacent industry, \nand not just consider the returns being earned by incumbents. Thus, \nas will be discussed in Chapter 16, it must have some potential ad-\nvantages over other potential entrants. \nDEFEND AGAINST FORECLOSURE \nEven if there are no positive benefits of integration, it may be \nnecessary to defend against foreclosure of access to suppliers or cus-\ntomers if competitors are integrated. Widespread integration by \ncompetitors can tie up many of the sources of supply or the desirable \ncustomers or retail outlets. In this case the unintegrated firm faces \nthe grim prospect of having to scramble for the remaining suppliers \nor customers and bears the risk that they may be inferior to those \ncaptured by integrated firms. Foreclosure thus raises the mobility \nbarrier of access to distribution channels or the absolute cost barrier \nof access to favorable suppliers of raw materials. \n",

These same considerations mean that the new entrant must \nenter the business on an integrated basis. Need for integration will \nraise mobility barriers in the same way previously described if there \nare significant economies of scale or capital requirements involved. \nThe foreclosure problem has triggered much defensive integration in \nsuch U.S. industries as cement and shoes. \nSTRATEGIC COSTS OF INTEGRATION \nThe strategic costs of vertical integration basically involve entry \ncost, flexibility, balance, ability to manage the integrated firm, and \nthe use of internal organizational incentives versus market incen-\ntives. \nCOST OF OVERCOMING MOBILITY BARRIERS \nVertical integration obviously requires the firm to overcome the \nmobility barriers to compete in the upstream or downstream busi-\nness. Integration is, after all, a special case (though a common one) \nof the general strategic option of entry into a new business.5 Because \nof the internal buying and selling relationship implied by vertical in-\ntegration, the integrating firm can often readily surmount some mo-\nbility barriers into the adjacent business, such as access to distribu-\ntion channels and product differentiation. However, overcoming \nbarriers caused by cost advantages from proprietary technology or \nfavorable sources of raw materials can be a cost of vertical integra-\ntion, as can overcoming other sources of mobility barriers, such as \neconomies of scale and capital requirements. As a result, vertical in-\ntegration occurs most frequently in industries like metal containers, \naerosol packaging, and sulfuric acid, in which the technology is well \nknown and the minimum efficient scale of a plant is not great. \nINCREASED OPERATING LEVERAGE \nVertical integration increases the proportion of a firm's costs \nthat are fixed. If the firm was purchasing an input on the spot mar-\nket, for example, all the costs of that input would be variable. If the \ninput is produced internally, the firm must bear any fixed costs in-\n'See Chapter 16 for an examination of the economic and strategic issues in entry \ndecisions generally. \n",

Since the sales of the upstream business are \nderived from the sales of the downstream business, factors that \ncause fluctuations in either business cause fluctuations in the whole \nchain. Fluctuations can be caused by the business cycle, by competi-\ntive or market developments, and so on. Thus integration increases \nthe operating leverage of the firm, exposing it to greater cyclical \nswings in earnings. Vertical integration thereby increases business \nrisk from this source, though the net effect of integration on risk \ndepends on whether it decreases business risk in other dimensions, as \nhas been discussed. The degree to which integration will increase op-\nerating leverage in a particular business clearly depends on the \namount of fixed costs present in the business in which integration oc-\ncurs. If the business has low fixed costs, for example, the effective \nincrease in operating leverage can be minor. \nA good example of the risk of operating leverage created by ex-\ntensive vertical integration is the Curtis Publishing Company. Curtis \nbuilt an immense vertical enterprise to supply its relatively few mag-\nazines, primarily the Saturday Evening Post. When the magazine \nran into difficulty in the late 1960s, the impact on the financial per-\nformance of Curtis was disastrous. \nREDUCED FLEXIBILITY TO CHANGE PARTNERS \nVertical integration implies that the fortunes of a business unit \nare at least partly tied to the ability of its in-house supplier or cus-\ntomer (who might be its distribution channel) to compete success-\nfully. Technological changes, changes in product design involving \ncomponents, strategic failures, or managerial problems can create a \nsituation in which the in-house supplier is providing a high-cost, in-\nferior, or inappropriate product or service or the in-house customer \nor distribution channel is losing position in its market and thus its \nsuitability as a customer. Vertical integration raises the costs of \nchangeover to another supplier or customer relative to contracting \nwith independent entities. For example, Imasco, a leading Canadian \ncigarette producer, backward integrated into the packaging material \nused in its manufacturing process. However, technological change \nmade this form of packaging inferior to other varieties, which the \ncaptive supplier could not produce.

Any of the exit barriers (described in Chapter \n12) can be affected. \nCAPITAL INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS \nVertical integration consumes capital resources, which have an \nopportunity cost within the firm, whereas dealing with an indepen-\ndent entity uses investment capital of outsiders. Vertical integration \nmust yield a return greater than or equal to the firm's opportunity \ncost of capital, adjusting for the strategic considerations discussed in \nthis chapter, in order for integration to be a good choice. Even if \nthere are substantial benefits to integration, they may not be enough \nto raise the return from integrating above the corporate hurdle rate \nwhen the firm is contemplating integration into potentially low-re-\nturn businesses like retailing or distribution. \nThis issue can manifest itself in the appetite for capital of the \nupstream or downstream business into which integration is contem-\nplated.

How-\never, if it chooses not to integrate (whereas other firms do), suppliers \nare often willing to support the firm aggressively with research, engi-\nneering assistance, and the like. \nForeclosure of technology can be a significant risk when there \nare numerous independent suppliers or customers doing research or \nwhere suppliers or customers have large-scale research efforts or \nhave particular know-how difficult to replicate. This risk is inherent \nin integrating to provide a direct tap into technology in adjacent \nbusinesses, though it may be counterbalanced by the risk of not inte-\ngrating for this reason.

The incentives for the upstream busi-\nness to perform may be dulled because it sells in-house instead of \ncompeting for the business. Conversely, the business buying inter-\nnally from another unit in the company may not bargain as hard as it \nwould with outside vendors. Thus, dealing in-house can reduce in-\ncentives. A related point is that internal projects to expand capacity, \nor internal contracts to buy or sell, may get less stringent review than \nexternal contracts with customers or suppliers. \nWhether or not these dulled incentives actually reduce perform-\nance in the vertically integrated firm is a function of the managerial \nstructure and procedures that govern the relationship between the \nadministrative units in the vertical chain. One often reads policy \nstatements concerning internal transactions that give managers the \nfreedom to use outside sources or to sell outside if the inside unit is \nnot competitive. The mere presence of such procedures is not \nenough, however. The use of an outside instead of an inside source \noften places the burden of proof on the unit manager and requires an \nexplanation to top management; most managers may well try to \navoid interacting with top management on such a basis.

Yet this is where arms-length relationships are the most nec-\nessary. \nThe difficulty just discussed, leads to the \"bad apple\" problem. \nIf the upstream or downstream unit is sick (strategically or other-\nwise), its problems may spill over to its healthy partner. One unit can \nbe pressured or even voluntarily attempt to rescue the troubled unit \nby accepting higher-cost products, products of inferior quality, or \nlower prices on internal sales. This situation can damage the healthy \nunit strategically. If the corporate parent seeks to help the troubled \nunit, it will do better to subsidize or support the unit directly rather \nthan indirectly through its sister unit.

For example, Texas \nInstruments' forward integration into consumer products such as \nwatches and calculators allowed it to develop a brand name, whereas \nits electronic components were essentially commodities. Monfort, a \ncattle feedlot operator, has forward integrated into meat-packing \nand distribution in part to develop a brand name at least with re-\ntailers. \nProviding service for a product as well as selling the product it-\nself may allow a company to differentiate itself even though its prod-\nuct is not superior to that of competitors. Forward integration into \nretailing sometimes allows the firm to control the salesperson's pre-\nsentation, the physical facilities and image of the store's location, \nthe incentives of the salesperson, and other elements of the retail sell-\ning function that help differentiate its product. The basic idea of in-\ntegration in all these cases is to increase value added to provide a \nbasis for differentiation that was unavailable or difficult in the unin-\ntegrated unit. In increasing product differentiation, the firm may at \nthe same time increase mobility barriers as well. \nAccess to Distribution Channels. Forward integration solves \nthe problem of access to distribution channels and removes any bar-\ngaining power the channels have. \nBetter Access to Market Information. \nIn a vertical chain the \nunderlying demand for the product (and the decision maker who ac-\ntually makes the choices among competing brands) often are located \nin a forward stage.

On the simplest \nlevel, it may allow the firm to determine the quantity of demand for \nits products sooner than if it had to infer it indirectly from orders by \nits customers. The interpretation of customers' orders is complicated \nby the presence of inventories held by each intervening stage. Earlier \nmarket information allows better adjustment of production levels \nand reductions in the costs of overages and under ages. \nInformational benefits may also be more subtle than simply the \nreceipt of timely information on the size of the demand.

In both construction and \nmetal fabricating, final demand is highly cyclical and its composi-\ntion often rapidly changes. Cyclical, erratic, and changing demand \nincreases the benefits of timely market information. If final demand \nis highly stable, market information gained from customers may be \nmore than sufficient. \n",

The consequences of changes in a particular cus-\ntomer's specifications or mix are much greater in this situation as \nwell. \nHigher Price Realization. In some cases forward integration \ncan allow the firm to realize higher overall prices by making it possi-\nble to set different prices for different customers for essentially the \nsame product. The problem with this practice is that arbitrage may \noccur, and the practice can be illegal in some cases under the Robin-\nson-Patman Act. If the firm integrates into the businesses that \nshould be charged with the lower price because its demand is more \nelastic, it may realize higher prices on sales to other customers.

Backward integration can allow the firm to \nenhance differentiation, though the circumstances are somewhat dif-\nferent than those of forward integration. By gaining control over the \nproduction of key inputs, the firm actually may be able to differen-\ntiate its product better or say credibly that it can.

Such a strong bargaining position is \ncharacteristic of the major automobile companies and the interna-\ntional oil companies (who purchase tanker shipping services to com-\nplement their own fleets).

    "chunk_full": "The Strategic Analysis of Vertical Integration \n321 \nQUASI-INTEGRATION \nQuasi-integration is the establishment of a relationship between \nvertically related businesses that is somewhere in between long-term \ncontracts and full ownership. Common forms of quasi-integration \nare as follows: \n• minority equity investment; \n• loans or loan guarantees; \n• prepurchase credits; \n• exclusive dealing agreements; \n• specialized logistical facilities; \n• cooperative R&D. \nIn some circumstances, quasi-integration achieves some or \nmany of the benefits of vertical integration without incurring all the \ncosts. It can create a greater community of interest between buyer \nand seller, which facilitates specialized arrangements (like logistical \nfacilities) that lower unit costs, reduce the risk of supply and demand \ninterruptions, mitigate against bargaining power, and so on. This \ncommunity of interest stems from goodwill, sharing of information, \nmore frequent and informal contacts between managements, and the \ndirect financial stake each side has in the other. Quasi-integration \ncan also reduce costs that may be present with full integration, and it \neliminates the necessity to commit to the full supply and demand of \nthe adjacent business. It also avoids the need to make the full capital \ninvestment required for integration and eliminates the necessity of \nmanaging the adjacent business, among other factors.9 \nQuasi-integration should be considered as an alternative to full \nintegration. The key is whether the community of interest estab-\nlished through quasi-integration is sufficient to achieve enough of \nthe benefits of integration to justify the reduction in the costs (and \nrisks) over full integration. Some benefits of integration, such as in-\ncreasing return on investment, raising product differentiation, or en-\nhancing mobility barriers, may be quite difficult to achieve with \nquasi-integration. An analysis of each benefit and cost of vertical in-\ntegration in the particular business with the alternative of quasi-inte-\ngration in mind will be necessary to evaluate its desirability as a \nstrategy. \n'For further discussion of quasi-integration in the context of a particular raw \nmaterial business, see D'Cruz (1979). \n",

    "chunk_full": "322 \nCOMPETITIVE STRATEGY \nIllusions in Vertical Integration Decisions \nThere are some common misperceptions about the benefits of \nvertical integration that must be guarded against: \n1. A strong market position in one stage can automatically be \nextended to the other. \nIt is often said that the firm with a strong position in its base \nbusiness can integrate into a more competitive adjacent business and \nextend its position to that market. Suppose a strong manufacturer of \nconsumer goods integrates forward into retailing, a very competitive \nbusiness. Although the integrated retailer might pick up all the man-\nufacturer's business, thereby increasing share, the manufacturer \nmight well be better served if many retailers were competing actively \nto sell its products.10 The manufacturer could indeed raise its prices \nto its captive retailer—though it would just be a bookkeeping trans-\nfer of profits from one unit to another—but if the captive retailer \nthen adjusted its prices, its competitive position would be worsened. \nThus the integration does not automatically allow the extension of a \nstrong market position at all. Only if the integration per se produced \nsome tangible benefits would integration allow the extension of mar-\nket power, because under these circumstances it would improve the \ncompetitiveness of the combined entity. \n2. It is always cheaper to do things internally. \nAs has been discussed, there are many potential hidden costs \nand risks in vertical integration that may be avoided by dealing with \noutside firms. There is also the possibility that clever contracting can \nreap the benefits of integration without the costs or risks. The econo-\nmies of integration are often looked at much too narrowly, and inte-\ngration decisions thereby ignore many of these issues. \n3. It often makes sense to integrate into a competitive business. \nThe deck is stacked against the advisability of integration into a \nhighly competitive industry. Firms in such an industry are earning \nlow returns and are competing vigorously to improve quality and \nserve customers. There are many firms to choose from in buying or \nselling. Vertical integration can dull incentives and blunt initiative. \n'\"If the adjacent industry into which integration is contemplated is very competitive, \nthe firm may often be worse off if all its output is directed to a single captive cus-\ntomer or supplier than if it deals through the market. In the competitive industry \nthe risks of being locked into one partner are usually the greatest. \n",

Vertical integration can save a strategically sick business. \nAlthough a strategy of vertical integration can bolster the stra-\ntegic position of a business under certain conditions already dis-\ncussed, it is rarely a sufficient cure for a strategically sick business. A \nstrong market position cannot be automatically extended vertically \nexcept under particular circumstances. Each stage of a vertical chain \nmust be strategically sound to insure the health of the enterprise as a \nwhole.

It is \nprobably the central aspect of strategy in commodity-type busi-\nnesses. Because capacity additions can involve lead times measured \nin years and capacity is often long lasting, capacity decisions require \nthe firm to commit resources based on expectations about conditions \nfar into the future. Two types of expectations are crucial: those \nabout future demand and those about competitors' behavior. The \nimportance of the former in capacity decisions is obvious. Accurate \nexpectations about competitors' behavior is essential as well, be-\ncause if too many competitors add capacity, no firm is likely to es-\ncape the adverse consequences. Thus, capacity expansion involves all \nthe classic problems of oligopoly, in which firms are mutually de-\npendent. \nThe strategic issue in capacity expansion is how to add capacity \nto further the objectives of the firm, in the hope of improving its \ncompetitive position or market share, while avoiding industry over-\ncapacity. Undercapacity in an industry is rarely a problem, except \ntemporarily, since it will usually attract new investment. However, \nbecause investments in capacity are largely irreversible, capacity \novershooting demand may well persist for long periods of time. \n324 \n",

First, the elements of the decision will be outlined. \nSince industry overbuilding is a chronic problem, the next section \nwill examine the causes of overbuilding and some approaches to pre-\nventing it. Finally, the preemptive strategy for capacity expansion \nwill be discussed, a strategy that has become more common in the \n1960s and 1970s. \nElements of the Capacity Expansion Decision \nThe mechanics of making a capacity expansion decision in the \ntraditional capital budgeting sense are quite straightforward—any \nfinance textbook will supply the details. Future cash flows resulting \nfrom the new capacity are forecasted and discounted to weigh them \nagainst the cash outflows required for the investment. The resulting \nnet present value ranks the capacity addition against the other invest-\nment projects available to the firm. \nHowever, this simplicity masks an extremely subtle decision-\nmaking problem. The firm usually has a number of options for add-\ning capacity which must be compared. In addition, to determine fu-\nture cash inflow from the new capacity the firm must predict future \nprofits. These will depend crucially on the size and timing of capa-\ncity decisions by each and every one of its competitors, as well as on \nany number of other factors. There is also usually uncertainty about \nfuture trends in technology, as well as about what future demand \nwill be. \nThe essence of the capacity decision, then, is not the discounted \ncash flow calculation but the numbers that go into it, including prob-\nability assessments about the future. Estimating these is in turn a \nsubtle problem in industry and competitor analysis (not financial \nanalysis). \nThe simple calculation presented in finance textbooks does not \nallow for uncertainty and alternate assumptions about competitors' \nbehavior. In view of the complexity of the discounted cash flow cal-\nculation that properly includes these elements, it is useful to model \nthe capacity decision with as high a precision as possible. The steps \nin Figure 15-1 describe the elements of the modeling process. \n",

Competitors' capacity moves will, \nof course, be determined by their expectations about future demand, \ncosts and technology. Thus, predicting their behavior involves un-\ncovering (or guessing) what these expectations are likely to be. \nPredicting competitors' behavior is also an iterative process, be-\ncause what one competitor does will influence the others, particular-\nly if that competitor is an industry leader. Therefore, competitors' \ncapacity additions must be played against each other to predict a \nprobable sequence of actions and resulting responses. There is a \nbandwagon process in capacity expansion, to be discussed later, \nwhich is important to try to forecast. \nThe next step in the analysis is adding competitors' and the \nfirm's behavior to yield aggregate industry capacity and individual \nmarket shares, which can be balanced against expected demand. \nThis step will allow the firm to estimate industry prices, and in turn, \nexpected cash flows from the investment. \nThe whole process must be scrutinized for inconsistencies. If the \nresult of the predictions is that one competitor fares poorly by not \nadding capacity, for example, the analysis may have to be adjusted \nto allow that competitor to see the error of its ways and add capacity \nlate. Or if the entire process of predicted expansion leads to condi-\ntions that violate most firms' predicted expectations, it may have to \nbe adjusted.

The \nproblem occurs when too many firms try to preempt, and capacity is \noverbuilt because firms mistake each others' intentions, misread sig-\nnals, or misjudge their relative strengths and staying power. Such \na situation is one major cause of the overbuilding of industry capaci-\nty, which I will explore further. \nCauses of Overbuilding Capacity \nThere seems to be a strong tendency toward overbuilding of ca-\npacity, particularly in commodity businesses, that goes far beyond \nthat due to mistaken attempts at preemption. Since overbuilding is a \nkey problem in capacity expansion, we must explore its causes in \nsome detail. \nThe risk of overbuilding is most severe in commodity businesses \nfor two reasons. \n1. Demand is generally cyclical. Cyclical demand not only \nguarantees overcapacity in downturns but also seems to lead \nto excessively optimistic expectations in upturns. \n2. Products are not differentiated. This factor makes costs \ncrucial to competition, since the buyers' choice is heavily \nbased on price. Also, the absence of brand loyalty means \nthat firms' sales are closely tied to the amount of capacity \nthey have. Thus, firms are under great pressure to have \nlarge, modern plants to be competitive and adequate capaci-\nty to achieve their target market share.2 \nA number of conditions lead to overbuilding in industries, both \nin commodity businesses and other businesses, which can be divided \ninto the following categories. If one or more factors are present in an \nindustry the risks of overbuilding can be severe. \nTECHNOLOGICAL \nAdding Capacity in Large Lumps. The necessity to add capac-\nity in large units increases the risk that bunching of capacity deci-\n2Demand is also often quite inelastic in commodity businesses.

This was a major factor in the \novercapacity of color picture tubes that developed in the late 1960s. \nMany firms producing television sets perceived the need to assure a \nsupply of tubes, but the size of an efficient tube plant was very large \nrelative to that of a television set assembly plant. Demand did not \ngrow rapidly enough to absorb the massive color tube capacity put \non stream all at once. \nEconomies of Scale or a Significant Learning Curve. This fac-\ntor makes it more likely that attempts at preemptive behavior like \nthat previously described will occur. The firm with the largest capa-\ncity or which adds capacity early will have a cost advantage, putting \npressure on all firms to move quickly and aggressively. \nLong Lead Times in Adding Capacity. Long lead times re-\nquire firms to base their decisions on projections of demand and \ncompetitive behavior far into the future or pay a penalty in not capi-\ntalizing on opportunity if demand materializes.3 Long lead times in-\ncrease the penalty to the firm who is left behind without capacity, \nand hence may cause risk-averse firms to be more prone to invest \neven though the capacity decision itself is risky. \nIncreased Minimum Efficient Scale (MES). Where MES is in-\ncreasing and the new larger plants being built are significantly more \nefficient, unless demand is growing rapidly the number of plants in \nthe industry must shrink or there will be overcapacity. Unless every \nfirm has several plants and can consolidate them, some firms will \nnecessarily have to reduce market share, something they may loathe \nto do. More likely every firm will build the larger new facilities, \ncreating overcapacity. \nA variation of this situation has been occurring in the oil tanker \nshipping industry, where the new Supertankers are many times the \nsize of the older vessels. The capacity of Supertankers ordered in the \nearly 1970s far exceeded the market demand. \nChanges in Production Technology. Changes in production \ntechnology have the effect of attracting investment in the new tech-\nnology, though plants using the old technology are left operating. \nThe higher the exit barriers for the old facilities, the less likely will \nthey be withdrawn from the market in an orderly way.

Where exit barriers are significant, \ninefficient excess capacity does not leave the market smoothly. This \nfactor accentuates and elongates periods of overcapacity. \nForcing by Suppliers. Equipment suppliers, through sub-\nsidies, easy financing, price cuts, and the like, can increase over-\nbuilding of capacity in their customers' industries. In a scramble for \norders, suppliers can also make it possible for marginal competitors \nto build capacity who would be unable to under normal circum-\nstances.

Here lack of capacity can help substitutes penetrate \nthe industry, and firms are motivated to prevent it. \nIntegrated Competitors. If competitors in the industry are \nalso integrated downstream, pressures for overbuilding may be in-\ncreased because each firm wants to protect its ability to supply its \ndownstream operations. Under these circumstances, if the firm has \ninsufficient capacity to supply demand, it will lose not only market \nshare in the industry but also possibly share (or greater risks of ob-\ntaining input supplies) in its downstream unit. Therefore, it is more \napt to insure it has enough capacity even if there is uncertainty about \nfuture demand. A similar argument holds if competitors are inte-\ngrated upstream. \nCapacity Share Affects Demand. In industries such as airlines \nthe firm with the greatest capacity may get a disproportionate share \nof demand because buyers are prone to approach it first. This char-\nacteristic creates strong pressures for overbuilding capacity as sev-\neral firms strive for capacity leadership.5 \nAge and Type of Capacity Affects Demand. \nIn some indus-\ntries, such as many service businesses, capacity is marketed directly \nto buyers. Having the most modern, well-decorated fast-food outlet, \nfor example, may yield competitive benefits. In industries where \nbuyers choose among firms based solely or in part on the type of ca-\npacity they have available, these pressures for overcapacity exist. \nCOMPETITIVE \nLarge Number of Firms. The tendency toward overbuilding is \nmost severe when many firms have the strengths and resources to \nadd significant capacity to the market, and they are all trying to gain \nmarket position and possibly to preempt the market. Paper, fer-\ntilizer, corn milling, and shipping are industries in which large num-\nbers of firms have contributed to making overbuilding a severe \nproblem. \n'See Fruhan (1972). \n",

Thus a strong leader or small group of leaders can \noften orchestrate an orderly expansion through their announcements \nand actions. The conditions for credibility and the mechanisms used \nare discussed in Chapter 5. \nNew entry. New entrants often create or aggravate the prob-\nlem of overbuilding. They seek positions in the industry, often sig-\nnificant ones, and incumbent firms refuse to yield.

Although the financial com-\nmunity can sometimes be a stabilizing force, often security analysts \nseem to accentuate pressures toward overbuilding of capacity by \nquestioning managements who have not invested once their compet-\nitors have.

In addition, if it is unsuccessful in de-\nterring competition it can lead to disastrous warfare since major \novercapacity results and the other firms attempting preemption have \nmade a major strategic commitment to the market from which it \nmay be hard to back down. \nAs a result of the cost and risk of a preemptive strategy, it is im-\nportant to set forth the conditions that must be present for success. \nThe preemptive strategy is risky partly because all these conditions \nmust be satisfied. \nLarge Capacity Expansion Relative to Expected Market Size. If \na move is not large in relation to the expected size of the market, it \ncannot be preemptive. Thus there are straightforward conditions for \nthe size of the capacity expansion that must be made to preempt a \nmarket whose future demand conditions are known. However, a \ncrucial issue is the expectations each competitor and potential com-\npetitor holds about future demand. If any competitor or potential \ncompetitor believes that future demand will be large enough to ab-\nsorb the preemptive capacity move and then some, it may choose to \ninvest as well. Thus a firm attempting preemption either must be \nconfident it knows the expectations of its competitors or must try to \ninfluence those expectations in such a way as to insure that its move \nwill be viewed as preemptive.7 If competitors' view of potential de-\nmand is unrealistically high, the preempting firm must communicate \na credible commitment to quickly add further capacity if future de-\nmand proves higher than initially anticipated. \nLarge Economies of Scale Relative to Total Market Demand, or \nSignificant Experience Curve. If economies of scale are large rela-\ntive to total market demand, an early preemptive capacity move may \ndeny competitors enough residual demand to be efficient (see Figure \n15-2).

This \nstartling statement is the key to analyzing the economics of entry-\nfinding industry situations in which the market forces are not work-\ning perfectly. The overriding conclusion from our analysis is that \neven putting aside all the problems of integrating and managing new \nbusinesses, the acquisition or internal development of sound, well-\nmanaged businesses in favorable industry environments is far from \nsufficient to assure successful entry, despite the widespread belief to \nthe contrary. However, there are many possibilities for successful \nentry, as I will discuss. \nEntry through Internal Development \nEntry through internal development involves the creation of a \nnew business entity in an industry, including new production capa-\ncity, distribution relationships, sales force, and so on. Joint ventures \nraise essentially the same economic issues because they are also new-\nly started entities, although they create complicated questions about \nthe division of efforts among the partners and who has effective con-\ntrol.2 \nThe first important point in analyzing internal development is \nthat it requires the firm to confront directly the two sources of entry \nbarriers into an industry—structural entry barriers and the expected \nreaction of incumbent firms. The entrant through internal develop-\nment (hereafter termed internal entrant) must pay the price of over-\ncoming structural entry barriers and face the risk that existing firms \nwill retaliate. The cost of the former usually involves up-front in-\nvestments and start-up losses, which become part of the investment \nbase in the new business. The risk of retaliation by existing firms can \nbe viewed as an additional cost of entry, equal to the magnitude of \n2Joint ventures should be analyzed in the same fashion as an internal entry. If a \njoint venture passes this hurdle, the partner must then be scrutinized for any clues \nabout whether its goals, expectations, or managerial proclivities concerning the \nventure diverge from that of the firm.

The appropriate analysis of a decision to enter will balance the \nfollowing costs and benefits: \n1. the investment costs required to be in the new business, such \nas investment in manufacturing facilities and inventory \n(some of which may be elevated by structural entry barriers); \n2. the additional investment required to overcome other \nstructural entry barriers, such as brand identification and \nproprietary technology3; \n3. the expected cost from incumbents' retaliation against the \nentry, balanced against \n4. the expected cash flows from being in the industry. \nMany capital budgeting treatments of the entry decision neglect \none or more of these factors. For example, too often the financial \nanalysis assumes the industry prices and costs prevailing before entry \nand measures only the clearly visible investments necessary to the \nbusiness, like constructing manufacturing facilities and assembling a \nsales force. Ignored are the more subtle costs of overcoming struc-\ntural entry barriers, such as established brand franchises, distribu-\ntion channels tied up by competitors, competitors' access to the most \nfavorable sources of raw materials, or the need to develop propri-\netary technology. Also, new entry can raise the prices of scarce sup-\nplies, equipment, or labor, which means that the entering firm must \nbear higher costs. \nAnother factor often neglected is the effect the entrant's new ca-\npacity will have on the supply-demand balance in the industry. If the \ninternal entrant's addition to industry capacity is significant, its ef-\nforts to fill its plant will mean that at least some other firms will have \nexcess capacity. High fixed costs are likely to trigger price cutting or \nother efforts to fill capacity which will persist until someone exits \nfrom the business or until the excess capacity is eliminated by indus-\ntry growth or retirement of facilities. \n3The investments required to enter an industry through internal development may \nseem high relative to the cost of acquisition depending on the state of the acquisi-\ntion market, to be discussed later.

Under conditions described \nbelow, existing firms will react to an entry in a variety of ways. One \ncommon reaction is to shave prices, which may mean that the indus-\ntry prices assumed in pro forma calculations of the desirability of en-\ntry must be lower than those prevailing before entry. Prices are often \ndepressed for years after an entry occurs, as they were in corn wet \nmilling following the entries of Cargill and Archer-Daniels-Midland. \nEntry by Georgia-Pacific also has been disruptive to prices in the \ngypsum industry/ \nOther reactions of existing firms may be escalation in marketing \nactivities, special promotions, extension of warranty terms, easier \ncredit, and product quality improvements. \nAnother possibility is that an entry will trigger a round of exces-\nsive capacity expansion in the industry, particularly if the new en-\ntrant comes in with more up-to-date facilities than some incumbents \nhave.

Behavior toward past entrants and toward incumbents trying \nto shift strategic groups are especially useful clues. \nIDENTIFYING TARGET INDUSTRIES FOR INTERNAL ENTRY \nAssuming the potential entrant will properly analyze the ele-\nments of the decision described above, where is internal entry most \nlikely to be attractive? The answer to this question flows from the \nbasic framework of structural analysis. The expected profitability of \nfirms in an industry depends on the strength of the five competitive \nforces: rivalry, substitution, bargaining power of suppliers and \nbuyers, and entry. Entry acts as a balance in determining industry \nprofits. If an industry is stable, or in equilibrium, the expected prof-\nits of entrants should just reflect the height of structural barriers to \nentry and the legitimate expectations of entrants about retaliation. \nThe potential entrant, calculating its expected profits, should find \nthat they are normal, or average profits, even though the profits of \nincumbents may be high. Because the entrant must overcome struc-\ntural entry barriers and bear the risk of reaction from going firms, \nit faces higher costs than the successful firms in the industry, and \nthese costs eliminate its above-average profits. If the costs of entry \ndid not offset the above-average returns, other firms would already \nhave entered and driven profits down to the level where the costs of \nentry and the benefits of entry cancel. Thus it will rarely pay to enter \nan industry in equilibrium unless the firm has special advan-\ntages—market forces are at work that eliminate the returns. \nHow, then, does a company expect to achieve above-average re-\nturns from entry? The answer lies in identifying those industry situa-\ntions in which the market mechanism I have described is not working \nperfectly. Prime targets for internal entry by a firm fall into one of \nthe following categories: \n1. The industry is in disequilibrium. \n2. Slow or ineffectual retaliation from incumbents may be \nexpected. \n'For some discussion about this point, see Chapter 3. \n",

In new, rapidly growing industries, the com-\npetitive structure is usually not well established and the costs of entry \nmay be much less than they will be for later entrants. Probably no \nfirm will have locked up supplies of raw materials, created signifi-\ncant brand identification, or have much proclivity to retaliate to an \nentry. Going firms may face limits on the rate at which they can ex-\npand. However, a firm should not enter a new industry just because \nit is a new industry. Entry will not be justified unless a full structural \nanalysis (Chapter 1) leads to the prediction of above-average profits \nfor a period long enough to justify the investment. It is also impor-\ntant to note that in some industries the cost of entry for pioneers is \ngreater than that for firms entering later, just because of the costs of \npioneering. Some analytical techniques for identifying whether early \nor later entry is appropriate are discussed in Chapter 10 on emerging \nindustries. Finally, other entrants may well be forthcoming into a \nnew industry, and in order for it to expect profits to remain high the \nfirm must have some economic basis for believing that later entrants \nwill face entry costs higher than its own. \nRising Entry Barriers.

Where the \nprospects for entry are good because of disequilibrium, the market \nwill be sending the same signals to others, who will be prone to enter \nas well. Thus a decision to enter must carry with it some clear notion \nof why the entrant and not other firms will reap the benefits of dis-\nequilibrium. Often the ability to forecast this rests on the advantages \nof getting in early by spotting the disequilibrium first. But unless the \nentrant can create some barriers to imitation, the advantages of \nbeing early may be eroded (though not eliminated) over time.

If a firm can be among the first to dis-\ncover such an industry, it can reap above-average profits. \nIndustries that may be ripe targets for entry do not have the \ncharacteristics leading to vigorous retaliation (given earlier) and pos-\nsess some other unique factors. \nIncumbents' cost of effective retaliation outweighs the benefits. \nThe firm considering entry must examine the calculation each signif-\nicant incumbent will make in deciding how vigorously to retaliate.

This impact could occur through the improve-\nment of distributor relations, company image, defense against \nthreats, and so on. Thus even if the new business earns an average re-\nturn, the company as a whole will be better off. \nXerox's proposed entry into national digital data transmission \nnetworks may be an example of entry on this basis.8 Xerox seems to \nbe trying to build a broad base in the \"office of the future.\" Since \ndata transmission among computers, electronic mail, and elaborate \nlinkage of company locations is likely to be part of this future—as \nwell as conventional copying—Xerox may be trying to protect its ex-\nisting strong base even though it has no special advantages in the \ndata network business.

Even \nthough Eaton may have no reason to suspect above-average returns \nin auto repair per se, such an entry can boost its overall returns. \nGENERIC CONCEPTS FOR ENTRY \nSome common approaches to entry, which rest on various con-\ncepts for overcoming entry barriers more cheaply than other firms, \nareas follows: \nReduce Product Costs.

The market is well organized, involving finders, \nbrokers, and investment bankers all seeking to match buyers and \nsellers and often reaping large commissions for doing so. The mar-\nket has become more organized in recent years as both intermedi-\naries and participants have become more sophisticated.9 Intermedi-\naries now work actively to generate multiple bidders for selling \nfirms, and multiple bids are common. The market for companies is \nalso a market about which much is written in the press and many sta-\ntistics are now collected. All these things suggest that the market will \nfunction relatively efficiently. \nAn efficient market for companies works to eliminate any \nabove-average profits from making an acquisition. If a company has \nsound management and attractive future prospects, its price will be \nbid up in the market. Conversely, if its future is dim or if it requires \nmassive infusions of capital, its sale price will be low relative to book \nvalue. To the extent that the market for companies is working effi-\nciently, then, the price of an acquisition will eliminate most of the re-\nturns for the buyer. \nContributing to the market's efficiency is the fact that the seller \nusually has the option of keeping and operating the business. In \nsome situations the seller has compelling reasons to sell and is there-\nby vulnerable to accepting whatever price the market for companies \nsets. However, to the extent that the seller has the alternative of op-\nerating the business it will not rationally sell if the sale price does not \nexceed the expected present value of continuing to operate the busi-\nness. This expected present value puts a floor under the price for the \nbusiness. The price that results from the bidding process in the mar-\nket for companies must exceed this floor, or the transaction will not \ntake place. In practice, the price for the acquisition must significant-\nly exceed the floor to give the owners a premium for selling. In to-\nday's market for companies, large premiums over market value are \nthe rule rather than the exception. \nThis analysis suggests that it is quite difficult to win at the ac-\nquisition game.

This analysis is also consistent with \nthe conclusions of a number of studies by economists which suggest \nthat the seller, and not the buyer, usually captures most of the spoils \nfrom an acquisition. \nHowever, the real power of this analysis lies in directing atten-\ntion toward the conditions that determine whether or not a particu-\nlar acquisition will have a good chance of yielding an above-average \nreturn. Acquisitions will most likely be profitable if \n1. the floor price created by the seller's alternative of keeping \nthe business is low; \n2. the market for companies is imperfect and does not elimi-\nnate above-average returns through the bidding process; \n3. the buyer has a unique ability to operate the acquired \nbusiness. \nIt is crucial to note that the bidding process can eliminate the profit-\nability of an acquisition even if the floor price is low.

It clearly depends on the perceptions of the \nseller, and not the perceptions of buyers or of the market for com-\npanies. Obviously the floor will be lowest when the seller feels the \ngreatest compulsion to sell, for example, because of the following: \n• the seller has estate problems; \n• the seller needs capital quickly; \n• the seller has lost key management or sees no successors for \nexisting management. \nThe floor price will also be low if the seller is not optimistic \nabout its prospects if it were to continue to operate the business.

These imperfections stem from the fact that the market \nfor companies is trading products each of which is unique, that in-\nformation is highly incomplete, and that buyers and sellers often \nhave complex motives. Imperfections in the market leading to suc-\ncessful acquisitions will occur in the following situations, among \nothers: \n1. The buyer has superior information. A buyer may be in a \nbetter position to forecast favorable future performance from an ac-\nquisition than other buyers. It may know the industry or the trends \nin technology or have insights that other potential bidders do not. In \nthis case the bidding will stop short of eliminating all above-average \nreturns. \n2. The number of bidders is low. The probability that the bid-\nding process will not eliminate all the returns from the acquisition is \nincreased if the number of bidders is small. The number may be low \nif the candidate is an unusual business that would not fit with or be \nunderstood by many potential acquirors or if the candidate is very \nlarge (and not many buyers can afford it). The way in which the \nbuyer conducts negotiations can discourage the seller from seeking \nother bidders (\"we will not participate in a bidding war\"). \n3. The condition of the economy is bad. It appears that the \nstate of the economy affects not only the number of buyers but also \nwhat they are willing to pay. Thus a company may reap potentially \nabove-average returns by being willing to deal during economic \ndownturns if it is suffering less than other bidders. \n4. The selling company is sick. There is some evidence that sick \ncompanies are more heavily discounted than a true expected-value \nanalysis would suggest, perhaps because acquirors all seem to be \nlooking for sound companies with good management. Thus the \nnumber of bidders for sick companies may be lower, as well as the \nprices they are willing to pay. White Consolidated appears to have \nsuccessfully taken advantage of this situation by purchasing ailing \ncompanies or divisions at below book value and apparently making \nthem profitable. \n",

Luckily for acquirors, not all sellers try to \nmaximize the price they receive for their business. Since the selling \nprices of companies are often well in excess of what their owners be-\nlieve they need for financial well-being, sellers often value other \nthings. Common examples are the name and reputation of the buyer, \nthe way in which the seller's employees will be treated, whether the \nseller's management will be retained, and how much the buyer will \ninterfere in running the business if the owner plans to stay on. Com-\npanies selling divisions are somewhat less likely to have such noneco-\nnomic objectives than are owners or owner-managers selling an en-\ntire company, although they still can be present. \nThis analysis suggests that acquirors should look for companies \nwho will have noneconomic objectives and should cultivate these ob-\njectives. It also suggests that certain acquirors may have advantages \nbecause of the story they can tell sellers. If they can demonstrate \ngood treatment of employees and management of acquisitions in the \npast, for example, their case with potential sellers will be made more \ncredible. Large prestigious acquirors may also have an edge for simi-\nlar reasons, since owners want to associate their life's work (their \ncompany) with a blue chip organization. \nUNIQUE ABILITY TO OPERATE THE SELLER \nThe buyer can bid more than other buyers and still achieve \nabove-average returns under the following conditions: \n1. The buyer has a distinctive ability to improve the operations \nof the seller. A buyer with distinctive assets or skills that can im-\nprove the strategic position of the acquisition candidate can achieve \nabove-average returns from the acquisition. The other bidders, as-\nsuming less improvement of the acquisition in their calculations, will \nstop bidding before the returns are eliminated. Well-known exam-\nples of such acquisitions are Campbell's of Vlasic and Gould's of \nITE. \nPossessing the ability to improve the acquisition candidate is \nnot enough in and of itself. This ability must to some degree be dis-\ntinctive, because if it is not, there are likely to be other firms around \nwho will see the same potential. These firms may keep the bidding \ngoing until the returns from making the improvements are elimi-\nnated by the price. \n",

In both cases, the buyer must \nhave some distinctive ability to compete in the new business. In the \ncase of acquisition, the firm is able to outbid others for the candidate \nand still earn above-average profits. In the case of internal develop-\nment, the firm is able to overcome barriers to entry more cheaply \nthan other firms. \n2. The firm buys into an industry that meets the criteria for in-\nternal development. Many of the same points about favorable indus-\ntries made in the context of internal entry can apply here. If the \nacquiror can use the acquisition as a base from which to change in-\ndustry structure or to exploit conventional wisdom, or can take ad-\nvantage of slow or ineffective response by incumbents to strategy \nchanges, for example, possibilities for above-average returns in the \nindustry are good. \n3. The acquisition will uniquely help a buyer's position in its \nexisting businesses. If the acquisition can add something to bolster \nthe buyer's position in its existing businesses, the profitability of the \nacquisition may not be eliminated in the bidding process. A good ex-\nample of this logic as a motivation for acquisition is R.J. Reynolds' \nrecent acquisition of Del Monte. Reynolds has a number of food \nbrands (Hawaiian Punch, Chun King, Vermont Maid, and others) \nbut has failed to achieve significant market penetration for most of \nthem. The acquisition of Del Monte will provide a distribution sys-\ntem, more clout with food brokers, and entrance into international \nmarkets where Reynolds' existing brands are weak. Even if Del \nMonte yields only average returns, its positive affect on the rest of \nReynolds' food strategy may mean an above-average return from \nthe transaction. \nIRRATIONAL BIDDERS \nWhen bidding for acquisition candidates, it is extremely impor-\ntant to examine the motives and situation of other bidders. Although \nbidding will usually stop once above-average returns are eliminated, \nit is important to recognize that some competing bidders may con-\ntinue long after, from one firm's point of view, the returns are elimi-\nnated.

A \ncareful analysis of the factors entering into the bidder's reservation \nprice is indicated. \nSequenced Entry \nAny decision to enter an industry must include a target strategic \ngroup. However, the discussion in Chapter 7 combined with the \nanalysis earlier in this chapter suggests that a firm can adopt a se-\nquential strategy of entry involving initial entry into one group and \nsubsequent mobility from group to group. For example, Procter and \nGamble acquired the Charmin Paper Company, which had high-\nquality toilet tissue and some production facilities, but little or no \nbrand identification and only regional distribution. Starting from a \nbase in this strategic group, Procter and Gamble invested substantial \nresources in creating brand identification, achieving national distri-\nbution, and improving the product and production facilities. Thus, \nCharmin was shifted into a new strategic group. \nSuch a strategy of sequential entry may lower the total cost of \novercoming mobility barriers into the strategic group that is the ulti-\nmate target, and may lower the risks. Costs can be lowered by ac-\ncumulating knowledge and brand indentification in the industry \nthrough entry into the initial group, which is then used at no cost for \nmobility into the ultimate target group. Managerial talent can be de-\nveloped in a more measured way in this fashion. Also the reaction of \nexisting firms to entry might be tempered by such a sequenced \nstrategy. \nA sequenced strategy often lowers the risks of entry because the \nfirm can segment the risk. If it fails in its initial entry, the firm is \nspared the cost of going further; it would have to put all its chips on \nthe table if it tried to enter the ultimate target group right away.

It is often criticized for being more vulnerable to \nmanipulation. As a result, sometimes quantitative weighting \nschemes, using criteria determined to lead to industry attractiveness \nor company position in the particular industry, are employed to \nmake the analysis more \"objective.\" The screening technique re-\nflects the assumption that every business unit is different and re-\nquires its own analysis of competitive position and industry attrac-\ntiveness. As noted above, actually constructing the growth/share \nportfolio in practice involves the same type of particularistic analysis \nof each business unit. Hence its actual \"objectivity\" may really not \nbe far from that of the company position/industry attractiveness \nscreen. \nLike the growth/share portfolio matrix, the company posi-\ntion/industry attractiveness screen offers little but a basic consis-\ntency check in formulating competitive strategy for a particular in-\ndustry. The real issues involve deciding where to plot the business on \nthe grid, deciding if position on the grid implies the indicated strat-\negy and working out a detailed strategic concept for building, hold-\ning, or harvesting. These steps require the sort of detailed analysis \ndescribed in this book, because the criteria listed in Figure A-2 are \nfar from sufficient to determine industry attractiveness, company \nposition, or the appropriate strategy. It is difficult to see, for exam-\nple, how the screen could lead to a recommendation to invest in a de-\nclining industry, sound advice in some situations as discussed in \nChapter 12. \nYet the screen can play a part in competitor analysis, in much \nthe same way as the growth/share matrix can. It can be used to con-\nstruct competitors' portfolios at different points in time and to gain \nsome insight into what strategic mandate a competitor's business \nunit may be receiving from its corporate office. Whether to use the \ngrowth/share or company position/industry attractiveness tech-\nnique is largely a matter of taste (basically the same analysis is re-\nquired to use either of the techniques properly), unless a competitor \nis known to use one or the other. In the latter case the best predictive \npower is gained from the technique the competitor itself uses. Note \n",

    "chunk_full": "Appendix B \n369 \nIndustry Analysis Strategy \nThere are two important aspects in developing a strategy for an-\nalyzing an industry. The first is to determine just what it is one is \nlooking for. \"Anything about the industry\" is much too broad to \nserve as an effective guide for research. Although the full list of spe-\ncific issues that need to be addressed in an industry analysis depends \non the particular industry under study, it is possible to generalize \nabout what important information and raw data the researcher \nshould look for. The chapters in this book have identified the key \nstructural features of industries, the important forces causing them \nto change, and the strategic information necessary about competi-\ntors. These are the factors that are the target of an industry analysis, \nand the core of the framework that identifies these factors has been \npresented in Chapters 1, 3, 7, and 8 and extended in the rest of the \nbook. However, since these characteristics of structure and competi-\ntors are generally not raw data but rather the result of analysis of \nraw data, researchers may also find it useful to have a framework \nfor systematically collecting raw data. A simple but exhaustive set of \nareas under which to collect raw data is given in Figure B-l. The re-\nsearcher who can fully describe each of these areas should be in a po-\nsition to develop a comprehensive picture of industry structure and \ncompetitors' profiles. \nWith a framework for assembling data, the second major strat-\negy question is how sequentially to develop data in each area. There \nare a number of alternatives, ranging from taking one item at a time \nto proceeding randomly. As hinted earlier, however, there are im-\nportant benefits in getting a general overview of the industry first, \nand only then focusing on the specifics. Experience has shown \nthat a broad understanding can help the researcher more effectively \nspot important items of data when studying sources and organize \ndata more effectively as they are collected. \nA number of steps can be useful in obtaining this overview: \n1. Who is in the industry. It is wise to develop a rough list of in-\ndustry participants right away, especially the leading firms. A list of \nkey competitors is helpful for quickly finding other articles and com-\npany documents (some of the sources discussed later will aid in this \nprocess).

A single annual re-\nport may contain only modest amounts of disclosure. However, a \nquick review of the annual reports for a number of major com-\npanies over a ten- or fifteen-year period is an excellent way to begin \nto understand the industry. Most aspects of the business will be dis-\ncussed at one time or another. The most enlightening part of an an-\nnual report for an overview is often the president's letter. The re-\nsearcher should look for the rationales given for both good and bad \nfinancial results; these should expose some of the critical success fac-\ntors in the industry. It also is important to note what the company \nseems to be proud of in its annual report, what it seems to be worried \nabout, and what key changes have been made. It is also possible to \ngain some insights into how companies are organized, the flow of \nproduction, and numerous other factors from reading between the \nlines in a series of annual reports from the same company. \nThe researcher will generally want to come back to annual re-\nports and other company documents later in the study. The initial \nearly reading will fail to uncover many nuances that become appar-\nent once the knowledge of the industry and the competitor is more \ncomplete. \nGET INTO THE FIELD EARLY \nIf there is any common problem in getting industry analyses un-\nderway, it is that researchers tend to spend too much time looking \nfor published sources and using the library before they begin to tap \nfield sources. As will be discussed later, published sources have a va-\nriety of limitations: timeliness, level of aggregation, depth, and so \non. Although it is important to gain some basic understanding of the \nindustry to maximize the value of field interviews, the researcher \nshould not exhaust all published sources before getting into the field. \nOn the contrary, clinical and library research should proceed simul-\ntaneously. They tend to feed on each other, especially if the re-\nsearcher is aggressive in asking every field source to suggest pub-\nlished material about the industry. Field sources tend to be more \nefficient because they get to the issues, without the wasted time of \nreading useless documents. Interviews also sometimes help the re-\nsearcher identify the issues.

An \ninitial period of euphoria gives way to confusion and even panic as \nthe complexity of the industry becomes apparent and mounds of in-\nformation accumulate. Sometime later in the study, it all begins to \ncome together. This pattern appears to be so common as to serve as a \nuseful thing for researchers to remember. \nPublished Sources for Analysis of Industry \nand Competitors \nThe amount of published information available varies widely by \nindustry. The larger the industry, the older it is, and the slower the \nrate of technological change, the better the available published infor-\nmation tends to be. Unfortunately for the researcher, many interest-\ning industries do not meet these criteria, and there may be little pub-\nlished information available. However, it is always possible to gain \nsome important information about an industry from published \nsources, and these sources should be aggressively pursued. General-\nly, the problem the researcher will face in using published data for \nanalyzing an economically meaningful industry is that they are too \nbroad, or too aggregated, to fit the industry. If a researcher starts \nsearching for data with this reality in mind, the usefulness of broad \ndata will be better recognized and the tendency to give up too easily \nwill be avoided. \nTwo important principles can greatly facilitate the development \nof references to published materials. First, every published source \nshould be combed tenaciously for references to other sources, both \nother published sources and sources for field interviews. Often arti-\ncles will cite individuals (industry executives, security analysts, and \nso on) who usually do not appear by accident; they tend to be either \nwell-informed or particularly vocal industry observers, and they \nmake excellent leads. \nThe second principle is to keep a thorough bibliography of \neverything that is uncovered.

They minimize the need for rereading \nand can facilitate communication within a research team. \nAlthough the types of published sources are potentially nu-\nmerous, they can be divided into a number of general categories, \nwhich are discussed briefly below.1 \nINDUSTRY STUDIES \nStudies that provide a general overview of some industries come \nin two general varieties. First are book-length studies of the indus-\ntry, often (but not exclusively) written by economists. These can \nusually best be found in library card catalogs and by cross-checking \nreferences given in other sources. Participants in or observers of an \nindustry will almost always know of such industry studies when they \nexist, and they should be questioned about them as the study pro-\nceeds. \nThe second broad category is the typically shorter, more fo-\ncused studies conducted by securities or consulting firms, such as \nFrost and Sullivan, Arthur D. Little, Stanford Research Institute, \nand all the Wall Street research houses. Sometimes specialized con-\nsulting firms collect data on particular industries, such as SMART, \nInc., in the ski industry and IDC in the computer industry. Often ac-\ncess to these studies involves a fee. Unfortunately, although there are \na number of published directories of market research studies, there \nis no one place where they are all compiled, and the best way to learn \nabout them is through industry observers or participants. \nTRADE ASSOCIATIONS \nMany industries have trade associations, which serve as clearing \nhouses for industry data and sometimes publish detailed industry \nstatistics.2 Trade associations differ greatly in their willingness to \n'L. Daniels (1976) is an excellent general source of business information. There are \nalso a number of computerized abstract services for references and articles avail-\nable at major business libraries, which can speed the task of finding articles and \nsorting the useful ones from those that are not so useful. \nThere are a number of published directories of trade associations. \n",

Once contact with a trade association staff member \nhas been made, this person can in turn be a useful source of referrals \nto industry participants and can identify participants who represent \na range of viewpoints. \nTRADE MAGAZINES \nMost industries have one or more trade magazines which cover \nindustry events on a regular (sometimes even daily) basis. A small in-\ndustry may be covered as part of a broader-based trade publication. \nTrade journals in customer, distributor, or supplier industries are \noften useful sources as well. \nReading through trade magazines over a long period of time is \nan extremely useful way to understand the competitive dynamics and \nimportant changes in an industry, as well as to diagnose its norms \nand attitudes. \nBUSINESS PRESS \nA wide variety of business publications cover companies and in-\ndustries on an intermittent basis.

No matter how skillful the interviewer, schedul-\ning interviews is invariably a frustrating process; many times an in-\nterview is declined or the interviewee is openly unenthusiastic about \nit. This is in the nature of the problem and must not deter the inter-\nviewer. Often an interviewee is much more enthusiastic once a meet-\ning has commenced and the relationship between interviewer and in-\nterviewee has become more personal. \nCredibility. Interviewers greatly build credibility in arranging \ninterviews and conducting them by having some knowledge of the \nbusiness. This knowledge should be displayed early both in initial \ncontacts and in interviews themselves. It makes the interview more \ninteresting and potentially useful for the subject. \nTeamwork. Interviewing is a tiring job and should ideally be \ndone in teams of two if resources permit. While one member asks a \n",

It also allows one interviewer to maintain eye \ncontact while the other takes notes. Teamwork also allows for a de-\nbriefing session immediately after the interview or at the end of the \nday, which is extremely useful in reviewing and clarifying notes, \nchecking for consistent impressions, analyzing the interview, and \nsynthesizing findings. Often much creative work in industry research \nis done in such sessions. A solo interviewer should leave time for \nsuch activity as well. \nQuestions. Gathering accurate data depends on asking un-\nbiased questions, which do not prejudge or limit the answer nor ex-\npose the interviewer's own leanings. The interviewer must also be \nsensitive not to signal with his or her behavior, tone of voice, or ex-\npression what the \"desired\" answer is. Most people like to be coop-\nerative and agreeable, and such signaling may bias the answer. \nNotes. In addition to taking notes, the researcher can benefit \nfrom writing down observations about the interview itself. What \npublications does the individual use? What books are on the shelves? \nHow are the offices decorated? Are they plush or sparse? Does the \ninterviewee have any sample products in the office? This type of in-\nformation often provides useful clues in interpreting the verbal data \nthat result from the interview and also provides leads for additional \nsources. \nRelationships. It is important to recognize that the subject is \nhuman, has never met the researcher before, has his or her own set \nof personal characteristics, and may be quite uncertain about what \nto say or not say. The style and vocabulary of the subject, his or her \nposture and attitude, body language, and so on give important clues \nand should be diagnosed quickly. A good interviewer is usually \nadept at quickly building a relationship with the subject. Making an \neffort to adapt to the style of the interviewee, to lower the level of \nuncertainty, and to make the interaction personal rather than keep-\ning it on an abstract business level will pay off in the quality and can-\ndor of the information received. \nFormal Versus Informal. Much interesting information often \ncomes after the formal interview is over. For example, if the re-\nsearcher can get a plant tour, the interviewee may become much \nmore open as the setting becomes removed from the more formal \n",

The researcher should attempt to engineer inter-\nviews so that the inherent formality of the situation is overcome. \nThis may be done by meeting on neutral ground, getting a tour, hav-\ning lunch, or discovering and discussing other topics of common in-\nterest besides the industry in question. \nSensitive Data. It will generally be most productive to start an \ninterview with nonthreatening general questions rather than asking \nfor specific numbers or other potentially sensitive data. In situations \nin which concern over sensitive data may be likely, it is usually best \nto state explicitly at the beginning of an interview that the researcher \nis not asking for proprietary data but rather impressions about the \nindustry. Often individuals will be willing to provide data in the \nform of ranges, \"ball park\" figures, or \"round numbers\" that can \nbe extremely useful to the the interviewer. Questions should be struc-\ntured as follows: \"Is the number of salespersons you have closer to \n100 or 500?\" \nPursuing Leads. A researcher should always devote some time \nin interviews to asking questions such as the following: Whom else \nshould we speak to? What publications should we be familiar with? \nAre there any conventions going on that might be useful to attend? \n(A large number of industries have conventions taking place in Janu-\nary and February.) Are there any books that might be enlightening? \nThe way to maximize the use of interviews is to gain further leads \nfrom each one. If an interviewee is willing to provide a personal ref-\nerence to another individual, the offer should always be taken. It \nwill greatly facilitate the arrangement of further interviews. \nPhone Interviews. Phone interviews can be quite productive \nrelatively late in a study when questions can be highly focused. \nPhone interviews work best with suppliers, customers, distributors, \nand other third-party sources. \n",

    "chunk_full": "PREFACE\n \nTufts University has been my academic home for more than forty years,\nand for me it has always seemed to be just right, like Goldilocks’s\nporridge: not too burdened, not too pampered, brilliant colleagues to\nlearn from with a minimum of academic prima donnas, good students\nserious enough to deserve attention without thinking they are entitled to\nround-the-clock maintenance, an ivory tower with a deep commitment to\nsolving problems in the real world. Since creating the Center for\nCognitive Studies in 1986, Tufts has supported my research, largely\nsparing me the ordeals and obligations of grantsmanship, and given me\nremarkable freedom to work with folks in many fields, either traveling\nafar to workshops, labs, and conferences or bringing visiting scholars and\nothers to the Center. This book shows what I’ve been up to all these\nyears.\nIn the spring of 2012, I test-flew a first draft of the chapters in a\nseminar I offered in the Tufts Philosophy Department. That has been my\ncustom for years, but this time I wanted the students to help me make the\nbook as accessible to the uninitiated as possible, so I excluded graduate\nstudents and philosophy majors and limited the class to just a dozen\nintrepid freshmen, the first twelve—actually thirteen, due to a clerical\nfumble—who volunteered. We led each other on a rollicking trip through\nthe topics, as they learned that they really could stand up to the professor,\nand I learned that I really could reach back farther and explain it all\nbetter. So here’s to my young collaborators, with thanks for their courage,\nimagination, energy, and enthusiasm: Tom Addison, Nick Boswell, Tony\nCannistra, Brendan Fleig-Goldstein, Claire Hirschberg, Caleb Malchik,\nCarter Palmer, Amar Patel, Kumar Ramanathan, Ariel Rascoe, Nikolai\nRenedo, Mikko Silliman, and Eric Tondreau.\nThe second draft that emerged from that seminar was then read by my\ndear friends Bo Dahlbom, Sue Stafford, and Dale Peterson, who provided\nme with still further usefully candid appraisals and suggestions, most of\n",

INTRODUCTION:\nWHAT IS AN INTUITION PUMP?\n \nYou can’t do much carpentry with your bare hands and you can’t do\nmuch thinking with your bare brain.\n \n—BO DAHLBOM\n \nThinking is hard. Thinking about some problems is so hard it can make\nyour head ache just thinking about thinking about them. My colleague the\nneuropsychologist Marcel Kinsbourne suggests that whenever we find\nthinking hard, it is because the stony path to truth is competing with\nseductive, easier paths that turn out to be dead ends. Most of the effort in\nthinking is a matter of resisting these temptations. We keep getting\nwaylaid and have to steel ourselves for the task at hand. Ugh.\nThere is a famous story about John von Neumann, the mathematician\nand physicist who turned Alan Turing’s idea (what we now call a Turing\nmachine) into an actual electronic computer (what we now call a Von\nNeumann machine, such as your laptop or smart phone). Von Neumann\nwas a virtuoso thinker, legendary for his lightning capacity for doing\nprodigious calculations in his head. According to the story—and like\nmost famous stories, this one has many versions—a colleague\napproached him one day with a puzzle that had two paths to a solution, a\nlaborious, complicated calculation and an elegant, Aha!-type solution.\nThis colleague had a theory: in such a case, mathematicians work out the\nlaborious solution while the (lazier, but smarter) physicists pause and\nfind the quick-and-easy solution. Which solution would von Neumann\nfind? You know the sort of puzzle: Two trains, 100 miles apart, are\napproaching each other on the same track, one going 30 miles per hour,\nthe other going 20 miles per hour. A bird flying 120 miles per hour starts\n",

    "chunk_full": "at train A (when they are 100 miles apart), flies to train B, turns around\nand flies back to the approaching train A, and so forth, until the two trains\ncollide. How far has the bird flown when the collision occurs? “Two\nhundred and forty miles,” von Neumann answered almost instantly.\n“Darn,” replied his colleague, “I predicted you’d do it the hard way,\nsumming the infinite series.” “Ay!” von Neumann cried in\nembarrassment, smiting his forehead. “There’s an easy way!” (Hint: How\nlong until the trains collide?)\nSome people, like von Neumann, are such natural geniuses that they can\nbreeze through the toughest tangles; others are more plodding but are\nblessed with a heroic supply of “willpower” that helps them stay the\ncourse in their dogged pursuit of truth. Then there are the rest of us, not\ncalculating prodigies and a little bit lazy, but still aspiring to understand\nwhatever confronts us. What can we do? We can use thinking tools, by\nthe dozens. These handy prosthetic imagination-extenders and focus-\nholders permit us to think reliably and even gracefully about really hard\nquestions. This book is a collection of my favorite thinking tools. I will\nnot just describe them; I intend to use them to move your mind gently\nthrough uncomfortable territory all the way to a quite radical vision of\nmeaning, mind, and free will. We will begin with some tools that are\nsimple and general, having applications to all sorts of topics. Some of\nthese are familiar, but others have not been much noticed or discussed.\nThen I will introduce you to some tools that are for very special purposes\nindeed, designed to explode one specific seductive idea or another,\nclearing a way out of a deep rut that still traps and flummoxes experts.\nWe will also encounter and dismantle a variety of bad thinking tools,\nmisbegotten persuasion-devices that can lead you astray if you aren’t\ncareful. Whether or not you arrive comfortably at my proposed\ndestination—and decide to stay there with me—the journey will equip\nyou with new ways of thinking about the topics, and thinking about\nthinking.\nThe physicist Richard Feynman was perhaps an even more legendary\ngenius than von Neumann, and he was certainly endowed with a world-\nclass brain—but he also loved having fun, and we can all be grateful that\n",

You can see why. First, there is a culture of\nscientific writing in research journals that favors—indeed insists on—an\nimpersonal, stripped-down presentation of the issues with a minimum of\nflourish, rhetoric, and allusion. There is a good reason for the relentless\ndrabness in the pages of our most serious scientific journals. As one of\nmy doctoral examiners, the neuroanatomist J. Z. Young, wrote to me in\n1965, in objecting to the somewhat fanciful prose in my dissertation at\nOxford (in philosophy, not neuroanatomy), English was becoming the\ninternational language of science, and it behooves us native English-\nspeakers to write works that can be read by “a patient Chinee [sic] with a\ngood dictionary.” The results of this self-imposed discipline speak for\nthemselves: whether you are a Chinese, German, Brazilian—or even a\nFrench—scientist, you insist on publishing your most important work in\nEnglish, bare-bones English, translatable with minimal difficulty, relying\nas little as possible on cultural allusions, nuances, word-play, and even\nmetaphor. The level of mutual understanding achieved by this\ninternational system is invaluable, but there is a price to be paid: some of\nthe thinking that has to be done apparently requires informal metaphor-\nmongering and imagination-tweaking, assaulting the barricades of closed\nminds with every trick in the book, and if some of this cannot be easily\ntranslated, then I will just have to hope for virtuoso translators on the one\nhand, and the growing fluency in English of the world’s scientists on the\nother.\nAnother reason why scientists are often suspicious of theoretical\ndiscussions conducted in “mere words” is that they recognize that the\ntask of criticizing an argument not formulated in mathematical equations\nis much trickier, and typically less conclusive. The language of\nmathematics is a reliable enforcer of cogency. It’s like the net on the\nbasketball hoop: it removes sources of disagreement and judgment about\nwhether the ball went in.

Some philosophy\nprofessors yearn to teach advanced seminars only to graduate students.\nNot me. Graduate students are often too eager to prove to each other and\nto themselves that they are savvy operators, wielding the jargon of their\ntrade with deft assurance, baffling outsiders (that’s how they assure\nthemselves that what they are doing requires expertise), and showing off\ntheir ability to pick their way through the most tortuous (and torturous)\ntechnical arguments without getting lost.

Chemists typically get\nby with only a rudimentary knowledge of the history of chemistry, picked\nup along the way, and many molecular biologists, it seems, are not even\ncurious about what happened in biology before about 1950. My answer is\nthat the history of philosophy is in large measure the history of very\nsmart people making very tempting mistakes, and if you don’t know the\nhistory, you are doomed to making the same darn mistakes all over again.\nThat’s why we teach the history of the field to our students, and scientists\nwho blithely ignore philosophy do so at their own risk. There is no such\nthing as philosophy-free science, just science that has been conducted\nwithout any consideration of its underlying philosophical assumptions.\nThe smartest or luckiest of the scientists sometimes manage to avoid the\n",

Making mistakes is the key to making progress. Of course there are\ntimes when it is really important not to make any mistakes—ask any\nsurgeon or airline pilot. But it is less widely appreciated that there are\nalso times when making mistakes is the only way to go. Many of the\nstudents who arrive at very competitive universities pride themselves in\nnot making mistakes—after all, that’s how they’ve come so much farther\nthan their classmates, or so they have been led to believe. I often find that\nI have to encourage them to cultivate the habit of making mistakes, the\nbest learning opportunities of all. They get “writer’s block” and waste\nhours forlornly wandering back and forth on the starting line. “Blurt it\nout!” I urge them. Then they have something on the page to work with.\nWe philosophers are mistake specialists. (I know, it sounds like a bad\njoke, but hear me out.) While other disciplines specialize in getting the\nright answers to their defining questions, we philosophers specialize in\nall the ways there are of getting things so mixed up, so deeply wrong, that\nnobody is even sure what the right questions are, let alone the answers.\nAsking the wrongs questions risks setting any inquiry off on the wrong\nfoot. Whenever that happens, this is a job for philosophers! Philosophy—\nin every field of inquiry—is what you have to do until you figure out\nwhat questions you should have been asking in the first place. Some\npeople hate it when that happens. They would rather take their questions\noff the rack, all nicely tailored and pressed and cleaned and ready to\nanswer. Those who feel that way can do physics or mathematics or\nhistory or biology. There’s plenty of work for everybody. We\nphilosophers have a taste for working on the questions that need to be\nstraightened out before they can be answered. It’s not for everyone.

I’ve made some dillies, and hope to\nmake a lot more. One of my goals in this book is to help you make good\nmistakes, the kind that light the way for everybody.\nFirst the theory, and then the practice. Mistakes are not just\nopportunities for learning; they are, in an important sense, the only\nopportunity for learning or making something truly new. Before there can\nbe learning, there must be learners. There are only two non-miraculous\nways for learners to come into existence: they must either evolve or be\ndesigned and built by learners that evolved. Biological evolution\nproceeds by a grand, inexorable process of trial and error—and without\nthe errors the trials wouldn’t accomplish anything. As Gore Vidal once\nsaid, “It is not enough to succeed. Others must fail.” Trials can be either\nblind or foresighted. You, who know a lot, but not the answer to the\nquestion at hand, can take leaps—foresighted leaps. You can look before\nyou leap, and hence be somewhat guided from the outset by what you\nalready know. You need not be guessing at random, but don’t look down\nyour nose at random guesses; among its wonderful products is . . . you!\nEvolution is one of the central themes of this book, as of all my books,\nfor the simple reason that it is the central, enabling process not only of\nlife but also of knowledge and learning and understanding. If you attempt\nto make sense of the world of ideas and meanings, free will and morality,\nart and science and even philosophy itself without a sound and quite\ndetailed knowledge of evolution, you have one hand tied behind your\nback. Later, we will look at some tools designed to help you think about\nsome of the more challenging questions of evolution, but here we need to\nlay a foundation. For evolution, which knows nothing, the steps into\nnovelty are blindly taken by mutations, which are random copying\n“errors” in DNA. Most of these typographical errors are of no\nconsequence, since nothing reads them! They are as inconsequential as\nthe rough drafts you didn’t, or don’t, hand in to the teacher for grading.\nThe DNA of a species is rather like a recipe for building a new body, and\nmost of the DNA is never actually consulted in the building process.

In the DNA sequences that\ndo get read and acted upon during development, the vast majority of\nmutations are harmful; many, in fact, are swiftly fatal. Since the majority\nof “expressed” mutations are deleterious, the process of natural selection\nactually works to keep the mutation rate very low. Each of you has very,\nvery good copying machinery in your cells. For instance, you have\nroughly a trillion cells in your body, and each cell has either a perfect or\nan almost perfect copy of your genome, over three billion symbols long,\nthe recipe for you that first came into existence when your parents’ egg\nand sperm joined forces. Fortunately, the copying machinery does not\nachieve perfect success, for if it did, evolution would eventually grind to\na halt, its sources of novelty dried up. Those tiny blemishes, those\n“imperfections” in the process, are the source of all the wonderful design\nand complexity in the living world. (I can’t resist adding: if anything\ndeserves to be called Original Sin, these copying mistakes do.)\nThe chief trick to making good mistakes is not to hide them—\nespecially not from yourself. Instead of turning away in denial when you\nmake a mistake, you should become a connoisseur of your own mistakes,\nturning them over in your mind as if they were works of art, which in a\nway they are. The fundamental reaction to any mistake ought to be this:\n“Well, I won’t do that again!” Natural selection doesn’t actually think the\nthought; it just wipes out the goofers before they can reproduce; natural\nselection won’t do that again, at least not as often. Animals that can learn\n—learn not to make that noise, touch that wire, eat that food—have\nsomething with a similar selective force in their brains. (B. F. Skinner and\nthe behaviorists understood the need for this and called it\n“reinforcement” learning; that response is not reinforced and suffers\n“extinction.”) We human beings carry matters to a much more swift and\nefficient level. We can actually think the thought, reflecting on what we\nhave just done: “Well, I won’t do that again!” And when we reflect, we\nconfront directly the problem that must be solved by any mistake-maker:\nwhat, exactly, is that? What was it about what I just did that got me into\nall this trouble?

Any being, any agent, who can truly say, “Well, it seemed like a\ngood idea at the time!” is standing on the threshold of brilliance. We\nhuman beings pride ourselves on our intelligence, and one of its\nhallmarks is that we can remember our previous thinking, and reflect on it\n—on how it seemed, on why it was tempting in the first place, and then\nabout what went wrong. I know of no evidence to suggest that any other\nspecies on the planet can actually think this thought. If they could, they\nwould be almost as smart as we are.\nSo when you make a mistake, you should learn to take a deep breath,\ngrit your teeth, and then examine your own recollections of the mistake as\nruthlessly and as dispassionately as you can manage. It’s not easy. The\nnatural human reaction to making a mistake is embarrassment and anger\n(we are never angrier than when we are angry at ourselves), and you have\nto work hard to overcome these emotional reactions.

But that is not\nenough: you should actively seek out opportunities to make grand\nmistakes, just so you can then recover from them.\nAt its simplest, this is a technique we all learned in grade school. Recall\nhow strange and forbidding long division seemed at first: You were\nconfronted by two imponderably large numbers, and you had to figure out\nhow to start. Does the divisor go into the dividend six or seven or eight\ntimes? Who knew? You didn’t have to know; you just had to take a stab\nat it, whichever number you liked, and check out the result. I remember\nbeing almost shocked when I was told I should start by just “making a\nguess.” Wasn’t this mathematics? You weren’t supposed to play guessing\ngames in such a serious business, were you?

The good thing about long division was that it always worked, even if\nyou were maximally stupid in making your first choice, in which case it\njust took a little longer.\nThis general technique of making a more-or-less educated guess,\nworking out its implications, and using the result to make a correction for\nthe next phase has found many applications. A key element of this tactic\nis making a mistake that is clear and precise enough to have definite\nimplications. Before GPS came along, navigators used to determine their\nposition at sea by first making a guess about where they were (they made\na guess about exactly what their latitude and longitude were), and then\ncalculating exactly how high in the sky the sun would appear to be if that\nwere—by an incredible coincidence—their actual position. When they\nused this method, they didn’t expect to hit the nail on the head. They\ndidn’t have to. Instead they then measured the actual elevation angle of\nthe sun (exactly) and compared the two values. With a little more trivial\ncalculation, this told them how big a correction, and in what direction, to\nmake to their initial guess.1 In such a method it is useful to make a pretty\ngood guess the first time, but it doesn’t matter that it is bound to be\nmistaken; the important thing is to make the mistake, in glorious detail,\nso there is something serious to correct. (A GPS device uses the same\nguess-and-fix-it strategy to locate itself relative to the overhead\nsatellites.)\nThe more complex a problem you’re facing, of course, the more\ndifficult the analysis is. This is known to researchers in artificial\nintelligence (AI) as the problem of “credit assignment” (it could as well\nbe called blame assignment). Figuring out what to credit and what to\nblame is one of the knottiest problems in AI, and it is also a problem\nfaced by natural selection. Every organism on the earth dies sooner or\nlater after one complicated life story or another.

If not, how could the process of natural selection explain why our\neyelids came to have the excellent shapes they have? Part of the answer is\nfamiliar: following the old adage “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” leave\nalmost all your old, conservative design solutions in place and take your\nrisks with a safety net in place. Natural selection automatically conserves\nwhatever has worked up to now, and fearlessly explores innovations large\nand small; the large ones almost always lead immediately to death. A\nterrible waste, but nobody’s counting. Our eyelids were mostly designed\nby natural selection long before there were human beings or even\nprimates or even mammals. They’ve had more than a hundred million\nyears to reach the shape they are today, with only a few minor touch-ups\nin the last six million years, since we shared a common ancestor with the\nchimpanzees and the bonobos. Another part of the answer is that natural\nselection works with large numbers of cases, where even minuscule\nadvantages show up statistically and can be automatically accumulated.\n(Other parts of the answer are technicalities beyond this elementary\ndiscussion.)\nHere is a technique that card magicians—at least the best of them—\nexploit with amazing results.

Here is what you do: You start by\ntelling the audience you are going to perform a trick, and without telling\nthem what trick you are doing, you go for the one-in-a-thousand effect. It\nalmost never works, of course, so you glide seamlessly into a second try\n—for an effect that works about one time in a hundred, perhaps—and\nwhen it too fails (as it almost always will), you slide gracefully into\neffect number 3, which works only about one time in ten, so you’d better\nbe ready with effect number 4, which works half the time (let’s say).

By hiding all the “mistake” cases from view—the\ntrials that didn’t pan out—you create a “miracle.”\nEvolution works the same way: all the dumb mistakes tend to be\ninvisible, so all we see is a stupendous string of triumphs. For instance,\nthe vast majority—way over 90 percent—of all the creatures that have\never lived died childless, but not a single one of your ancestors suffered\nthat fate.

J. C. Smart was famous for saying that\nyes, according to his theory of ethics, it was sometimes right to frame and\nhang an innocent man! Crick decided to outsmart me. “Yes! It would be\nan isolated instance of consciousness of red!” Whose consciousness of\nred? He didn’t say. He later refined his thinking on this score, but still, he\nand neuroscientist Christof Koch, in their quest for what they called the\nNCC (the neural correlates of consciousness), never quite abandoned\ntheir allegiance to this idea.\nPerhaps yet another encounter will bring out better what is problematic\nabout the idea of a smidgen of consciousness in a dish. The physicist and\nmathematician Roger Penrose and the anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff\nteamed up to produce a theory of consciousness that depended, not on\nglutamate, but on quantum effects in the microtubules of neurons.\n(Microtubules are tubular protein chains that serve as girders and\nhighways inside the cytoplasm of all cells, not just neurons.)

After all, the microtubules in the nerves of the\nhand would be doing their thing, just like the microtubules in the rest of\nthe nervous system, and that hand would be in great pain, would it not?”\nThe look on Stuart’s face suggested that this had never occurred to him.\nThe idea that consciousness (of red, of pain, of anything) is some sort of\nnetwork property, something that involves coordinated activities in\nmyriads of neurons, initially may not be very attractive, but these\nattempts at reductios may help people see why it should be taken\nseriously.\n1 My other indelible memory of that conference was of Popper’s dip in the Grand Canal.

Italian\ningenuity took over, and within about five minutes I enjoyed an unforgettable sight: Sir Karl,\nsitting regally on a small chair in the exact middle of a marble-floored, domed room (Palladio\ndesigned it) surrounded by at least half a dozen young women in miniskirts, on their knees,\nplying his trouser legs with their hairdryers. The extension cords stretched radially to the walls,\nmaking of the tableau a sort of multicolored human daisy, with Sir Karl, unperturbed but\nunsmiling, in the center.

If there are obvious contradictions in the opponent’s case,\nthen of course you should point them out, forcefully. If there are\nsomewhat hidden contradictions, you should carefully expose them to\nview—and then dump on them. But the search for hidden contradictions\noften crosses the line into nitpicking, sea-lawyering,1 and—as we have\nseen—outright parody. The thrill of the chase and the conviction that\nyour opponent has to be harboring a confusion somewhere encourages\nuncharitable interpretation, which gives you an easy target to attack. But\nsuch easy targets are typically irrelevant to the real issues at stake and\nsimply waste everybody’s time and patience, even if they give\namusement to your supporters. The best antidote I know for this tendency\nto caricature one’s opponent is a list of rules promulgated many years ago\nby the social psychologist and game theorist Anatol Rapoport (creator of\nthe winning Tit-for-Tat strategy in Robert Axelrod’s legendary prisoner’s\ndilemma tournament).2\nHow to compose a successful critical commentary:\n \n1. You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly,\nvividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of\nputting it that way.”\n2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not\nmatters of general or widespread agreement).\n3. You should mention anything you have learned from your target.\n4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or\ncriticism.\nOne immediate effect of following these rules is that your targets will be\na receptive audience for your criticism: you have already shown that you\nunderstand their positions as well as they do, and have demonstrated good\n",

I was\nparticularly diligent in my attempt to do justice to Robert Kane’s (1996)\nbrand of incompatib ilism (a view about free will with which I\nprofoundly disagree) in my book Freedom Evolves (2003), and I treasure\nthe response he wrote to me after I had sent him the draft chapter:\n. . . In fact, I like it a lot, our differences notwithstanding. The\ntreatment of my view is extensive and generally fair, far more so\nthan one usually gets from critics. You convey the complexity of my\nview and the seriousness of my efforts to address difficult questions\nrather than merely sweeping them under the rug. And for this, as\nwell as the extended treatment, I am grateful.\nOther recipients of my Rapoport-driven attention have been less cordial.\nThe fairer the criticism seems, the harder to bear in some cases. It is\nworth reminding yourself that a heroic attempt to find a defensible\ninterpretation of an author, if it comes up empty, can be even more\ndevastating than an angry hatchet job. I recommend it.\n1 Maritime law is notoriously complicated, strewn with hidden traps and escape clauses that\nonly an expert, a sea lawyer, can keep track of, so sea-lawyering is using technicalities to evade\nresponsibility or assign blame to others.\n2 The Axelrod tournament (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981; Axelrod, 1984) opened up the\nblossoming field of theoretical research on the evolution of altruism. I give an introductory\naccount in Darwin’s Dangerous Idea (Dennett, 1995, pp. 479–480), and in more recent times\nthere has been an explosion of variations, both simulations and experiments, in laboratories\naround the world. Rapoport’s wonderfully simple implementation of the idea “I won’t hit you if\nyou don’t hit me” is the seed from which all the later studies and models have grown.\n3 The formulation of Rapoport’s Rules here is my own, done from memory of correspondence\nwith Rapoport many years ago, now apparently lost. Samuel Ruth recently pointed out to me\nthat the original source of Rapoport’s Rules is in his book Fights, Games, and Debates (1960)\nand his paper “Three Modes of Conflict” (1961), which articulates rule 1, attributing it to Carl\nRogers, and variations on the rest of the rules.

A Latin name for it is lex parsimoniae, the law of parsimony. It\nis usually put into English as the maxim “Do not multiply entities beyond\nnecessity.” The idea is straightforward: don’t concoct a complicated,\nextravagant theory if you’ve got a simpler one (containing fewer\ningredients, fewer entities) that handles the phenomenon just as well. If\nexposure to extremely cold air can account for all the symptoms of\nfrostbite, don’t postulate unobserved “snow germs” or “arctic microbes.”\nKepler’s laws explain the orbits of the planets; we have no need to\nhypothesize pilots guiding the planets from control panels hidden under\nthe surface. This much is uncontroversial, but extensions of the principle\nhave not always met with agreement.\nConwy Lloyd Morgan, a nineteenth-century British psychologist,\nextended the idea to cover attributions of mentality to animals. Lloyd\nMorgan’s Canon of Parsimony advises us not to attribute fancy minds to\ninsects, fish, and even dolphins, dogs, and cats if their behavior can be\nexplained in simpler terms:\nIn no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher\npsychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of\nprocesses which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution\nand development. [1894, p. 128]\nOverused, this can be seen as enjoining us to treat all animals and even\nhuman beings as having brains but no minds. As we shall see, the\ntensions that arise when minds are the topic are not well settled by\nabsolute prohibitions.\nOne of the least impressive attempts to apply Occam’s Razor to a\ngnarly problem is the claim (and provoked counterclaims) that\npostulating a God as creator of the universe is simpler, more\nparsimonious, than the alternatives.

This\nis our first boom crutch, an anti-thinking tool, and you should keep your\neyes peeled for it. The practice is particularly insidious when used by\npropagandists who direct their efforts at the lay public, because like\nSherlock Holmes’s famous clue about the dog that didn’t bark in the\nnight, the absence of a fact that has been swept off the scene by Occam’s\nBroom is unnoticeable except by experts. For instance, creationists\ninvariably leave out the wealth of embarrassing evidence that their\n“theories” can’t handle, and to a nonbiologist their carefully crafted\naccounts can be quite convincing simply because the lay reader can’t see\nwhat isn’t there.\nHow on earth can you keep on the lookout for something invisible? Get\nsome help from the experts. Stephen C. Meyer’s Signature in the Cell\n(2009) purports to expose the systematic impossibility of life having a\nnatural (nonsupernatural) origin, and gives what seems—even to a\nrelatively well-informed reader—to be a fair and exhaustive survey of the\ntheories and models being worked on around the world, showing how\nirredeemably hopeless they all are.

Unlike the other practices I have been describing, this one takes time\nand money to do properly. I hope others will pursue this technique\nvigorously and report the results.

It is not done deliberately, for the most part, and it is almost\nimpossible to keep from doing—which is actually a good thing, since\nbeing polite in an unstudied way is a nice character trait in anyone. But\nthis gracious disposition to assume more understanding than is apt to be\npresent in one’s distinguished audience has an unfortunate by-product:\nexperts often talk past each other.\nThere is no direct cure: entreating all the experts present at a workshop\nor conference not to under-explain their positions may be met by earnest\npromises, but it won’t work.

Creativity, that ardently\nsought but only rarely found virtue, often is a heretofore unimagined\nviolation of the rules of the system from which it springs. It might be the\nsystem of classical harmony in music, the rules for meter and rhyme in\nsonnets (or limericks, even), or the “canons” of taste or good form in\nsome genre of art. Or it might be the assumptions and principles of some\ntheory or research program. Being creative is not just a matter of casting\nabout for something novel—anybody can do that, since novelty can be\nfound in any random juxtaposition of stuff—but of making the novelty\njump out of some system, a system that has become somewhat\nestablished, for good reasons. When an artistic tradition reaches the point\nwhere literally “anything goes,” those who want to be creative have a\nproblem: there are no fixed rules to rebel against, no complacent\nexpectations to shatter, nothing to subvert, no background against which\nto create something that is both surprising and yet meaningful. It helps to\nknow the tradition if you want to subvert it. That’s why so few dabblers or\nnovices succeed in coming up with anything truly creative.\nSit down at a piano and try to come up with a good new melody and you\nsoon discover how hard it is. All the keys are available, in any\ncombination you choose, but until you can find something to lean on,\nsome style or genre or pattern to lay down and exploit a bit, or allude to,\nbefore you twist it, you will come up with nothing but noise. And not just\nany violation of the rules will do the trick.

When you\nare confronting a scientific or philosophical problem, the system you\nneed to jump out of is typically so entrenched that it is as invisible as the\nair you breathe. As a general rule, when a long-standing controversy\nseems to be getting nowhere, with both “sides” stubbornly insisting they\nare right, as often as not the trouble is that there is something they both\nagree on that is just not so. Both sides consider it so obvious, in fact, that\nit goes without saying. Finding these invisible problem-poisoners is not\nan easy task, because whatever seems obvious to these warring experts is\napt to seem obvious, on reflection, to just about everybody. So the\nrecommendation that you keep an eye out for a tacit shared false\nassumption is not all that likely to bear fruit, but at least you’re more\nlikely to find one if you’re hoping to find one and have some idea of what\none would look like.\nSometimes there are clues. Several of the great instances of jootsing\nhave involved abandoning some well-regarded thing that turned out not to\nexist after all. Phlogiston was supposed to be an element in fire, and\ncaloric was the invisible, self-repellent fluid or gas that was supposed to\nbe the chief ingredient in heat, but these were dropped, and so was the\nether as a medium in which light traveled the way sound travels through\nair and water. But other admirable jootsings are additions, not\nsubtractions: germs and electrons and—maybe even—the many-worlds\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics! It’s never obvious from the outset\nwhether we should joots or not. Ray Jackendoff and I have argued that we\n",

Here are three related species, of the genus\nGoulding, named by me in honor of their most effective wielder.\nRathering is a way of sliding you swiftly and gently past a false\ndichotomy. The general form of a rathering is “It is not the case that\nblahblahblah, as orthodoxy would have you believe; it is rather that\nsuchandsuchandsuch—which is radically different.” Some ratherings are\njust fine; you really must choose between the two alternatives on offer; in\nthese cases, you are not being offered a false, but rather a genuine,\ninescapable dichotomy. But some ratherings are little more than sleight\nof hand, due to the fact that the word “rather” implies—without argument\n—that there is an important incompatibility between the claims flanking\nit.\nHere is a fine example of rathering by Gould in the course of his\naccount of punctuated equilibrium:\nChange does not usually occur by imperceptibly gradual alteration\nof entire species but rather [my italics] by isolation of small\npopulations and their geologically instantaneous transformation into\nnew species. [1992b, p. 12]\nThis passage invites us to believe that evolutionary change could not be\nboth “geologically instantaneous” and “imperceptibly gradual” at the\nsame time. But of course it can be. In fact, that is just what evolutionary\nchange must be, unless Gould is saying that evolution tends to proceed by\nsaltations (giant leaps in Design Space)—but elsewhere he has insisted\nthat he never ever endorsed saltationism. “Geologically instantaneous”\nspeciation can happen over a “short” period of time—let’s say fifty\nthousand years, an elapse of time barely detectable in most geological\nstrata.

What is missing is an argument to the effect that\n“moist robots” cannot also be people with free will who are morally\nresponsible. This example plays on a common—but controversial—\nassumption.

Nothing could be further from\nreality. [1989a, p. 14]\nWhat could not be further from reality? At first it might appear as if\nGould was saying that there is no continuous, unbroken lineage between\nthe “monads” (single-celled organisms) and us, but of course there is.\nThere is no more secure implication of Darwin’s great idea than that. So\nwhat can Gould be saying here? Presumably we are meant to put the\nemphasis on “pathways of progress”—it is (only) the belief in progress\nthat is “far from reality.” The pathways are continuous, unbroken\nlineages all right, but not lineages of (global) progress. This is true: they\nare (unbroken) continuous lineages of (mainly) local progress. We come\naway from this passage from Gould—unless we are wary—with the sense\nthat he has shown us something seriously wrong with the standard\nproposition of evolutionary theory that there are continuous pathways\n(unbroken lineages) from monads to man.

Here is the most\nportable of those examples:\nThe most transparent case is Gould’s invention of\n“extrapolationism,” described as a logical extension of “Cronin’s\nadaptationism.” This is a doctrine of pan-continuity and pan-\ngradualism that is conveniently—indeed trivially—refuted by the\nfact of mass extinction. “But if mass extinctions are true breaks in\ncontinuity, if the slow building of adaptation in normal times does\nnot extend into predicted success across mass extinction boundaries,\nthen extrapolationism fails and adaptationism succumbs.” I cannot\nsee why any adaptationist would be so foolish as to endorse anything\nlike “extrapolationism” in a form so “pure” as to deny the possibility\nor even likelihood that mass extinction would play a major role in\npruning the tree of life, as Gould puts it. It has always been obvious\nthat the most perfect dinosaur will succumb if a comet strikes its\nhomeland with a force hundreds of times greater than all the\nhydrogen bombs ever made. There is not a word in Cronin’s book\nthat supports his contention that she has made this error. If Gould\nthinks the role of mass extinctions in evolution is relevant to either\nof the central problems Cronin addresses, sexual selection and\naltruism, he does not say how or why. When Cronin turns, in her last\nchapter, to a fine discussion of the central question in evolutionary\ntheory she has not concentrated on, the origin of species, and points\nout that it is still an outstanding problem, Gould pounces on this as a\nlast minute epiphany, an ironic admission of defeat for her\n“panadaptationism.” Preposterous!

THE “SURELY” OPERATOR: A MENTAL BLOCK\n \nWhen you’re reading or skimming argumentative essays, especially by\nphilosophers, here is a quick trick that may save you much time and\neffort, especially in this age of simple searching by computer: look for\n“surely” in the document, and check each occurrence. Not always, not\neven most of the time, but often the word “surely” is as good as a\nblinking light locating a weak point in the argument, a warning label\nabout a likely boom crutch. Why? Because it marks the very edge of\nwhat the author is actually sure about and hopes readers will also be sure\nabout. (If the author were really sure all the readers would agree, it\nwouldn’t be worth mentioning.) Being at the edge, the author has had to\nmake a judgment call about whether or not to attempt to demonstrate the\npoint at issue, or provide evidence for it, and—because life is short—has\ndecided in favor of bald assertion, with the presumably well-grounded\nanticipation of agreement. Just the sort of place to find an ill-examined\n“truism” that isn’t true!\nI first noticed this useful role of “surely” when commenting on an essay\nby Ned Block (1994), which included several prime examples directed\nagainst my theory of consciousness. Here’s one, conveniently italicized1\nby Block to emphasize its obviousness typographically:\nBut surely it is nothing other than a biological fact about people—\nnot a cultural construction—that some brain representations\npersevere enough to affect memory, control behavior, etc. [p. 27]\nThis is meant to dismiss—without argument—my theory of human\nconsciousness as something that must, in effect, be learned, a set of\ncognitive micro-habits that are not guaranteed to be present at birth.\n“Wherever Block says ‘Surely,’ ” I said, “look for what we might call a\nmental block” (Dennett, 1994a, p. 549). Block is one of the most\nprofligate abusers of the “surely” operator among philosophers, but\nothers routinely rely on it, and every time they do, a little alarm bell\nshould ring. “Here is where the unintended sleight-of-hand happens,\n",

Dad just said a deepity!” What a\nwonderful impromptu coinage!1 I decided to adopt it and put it to\nsomewhat more analytic use.\nA deepity is a proposition that seems both important and true—and\nprofound—but that achieves this effect by being ambiguous.

I’m not sure what love is—maybe an emotion or\nemotional attachment, maybe an interpersonal relationship, maybe the\nhighest state a human mind can achieve—but we all know it isn’t a word.\nYou can’t find love in the dictionary!\nWe can bring out the other reading by availing ourselves of a\nconvention philosophers care mightily about: when we talk about a word,\nwe put it in quotation marks, thus:\n“Love” is just a word.\nThis is true; “love” is an English word, but just a word, not a sentence, for\nexample. It begins with “L” and has four letters and appears in the\ndictionary between “lousy” and “low-browed,” which are also just words.\n“Cheeseburger” is just a word. “Word” is just a word.\n",

Yet they all believe that a Frenchman\ncommitted murder in Trafalgar Square. This is a shared property that is\nvisible, in effect, only from one very limited point of view—the point of\nview of folk psychology. Ordinary folk psychologists—all of us—have\nno difficulty imputing such useful commonalities to people. We do it\nwithout knowing much of anything about what lies between the ears of\nthose to whom we attribute those beliefs. We may think that these four\nfellows must also have something else in common—a similarly shaped\nsomething-or-other in their brains that somehow registers their shared\nbelief—but if so, we are lapsing into dubious theorizing. There may in\nfact be some such neural structures in common—if all four brains happen\nto “spell” the belief that a Frenchman has committed murder in Trafalgar\nSquare the same way—but this is not at all necessary, and is in fact very\nunlikely, for reasons we will briefly explore here.\nThe two sentences “I’m hungry” and “J’ai faim” share a property, in\nspite of being composed of differently shaped letters (or different\nphonemes when uttered aloud), in different languages, and having\ndifferent grammatical structures: they mean, or are about, the same thing:\nthe speaker’s hunger. This shared property, the meaning (of the two\nsentences in their respective languages), or the content (of the beliefs\nthey express), is a central topic in philosophy and cognitive science.

Most of our belief acquisition isn’t like\nthat at all, and it is worth noting this. For instance, Jacques, Sherlock,\nTom, and Boris share indefinitely many other beliefs that did not arise so\ndramatically: the beliefs that, for instance, chairs are larger than shoes,\nthat soup is liquid, that elephants don’t fly. If I try to inform you that\nsalmon in the wild don’t wear hearing aids, you will tell me that this is\nnot news to you, but when did you learn it? You weren’t born knowing it,\nit was not part of any curriculum at school, and it is extremely unlikely\nthat you ever framed a sentence in your mind to this effect. So while it\nmight seem obvious that Boris must have learned about the Frenchman\nby “simply uploading” the relevant Russian sentence in Pravda into his\nbrain, and then “translating” it into, oh, Brainish, there is nothing obvious\nabout the supposition that Boris’s brain performed a similar clerical job\n(from what into Brainish?) for the fact about salmon.\nHere’s another knob: suppose Fido, a dog, and Clyde, a pigeon, are also\neyewitnesses of the murder; they may carry away something about the\nevent, an adjustment in their brains that could influence later behavior,\nbut it wouldn’t be the fact that a Frenchman committed murder in\nTrafalgar Square, even though the information sustaining that fact might\nbe present in the light and sound that impinged on their sense organs. (A\nvideotape of the event might provide legal evidence of this, for instance,\nbut it would be lost on Fido and Clyde.) So this intuition pump risks\ncarrying a seriously anthropocentric bias into our exploration of meaning.\nWords and sentences are exemplary vehicles of meaning, but for animals\nthat don’t use them, the idea that their brains nevertheless use them is at\nleast far-fetched—which doesn’t make it false. If it turns out to be true, it\nwill be a most eye-opening discovery, but we’ve had those before.\nThe phenomena of intentionality are both utterly familiar—as salient in\nour daily lives as our food, furniture, and clothes—and systematically\nelusive from scientific perspectives.

Here is a thinking tool that provides a\nvaluable perspective on so many issues that it should be in everybody’s\nkit, but so far it hasn’t spread far from its home in philosophy. The\nphilosopher Wilfrid Sellars devised it in 1962 to clarify thinking on what\nscience shows us about the world we live in. The manifest image is the\nworld as it seems to us in everyday life, full of solid objects, colors and\nsmells and tastes, voices and shadows, plants and animals, and people and\nall their stuff: not only tables and chairs, bridges and churches, dollars\nand contracts, but also such intangible things as songs, poems,\nopportunities, and free will. Think of all the puzzling questions that arise\nwhen we try to line up all those things with the things in the scientific\nimage: molecules, atoms, electrons, and quarks and their ilk. Is anything\nreally solid? The physicist Sir Arthur Eddington wrote, early in the\ntwentieth century, about the “two tables,” the solid one of everyday\nexperience and the one composed of atoms, widely separated in mainly\nempty space, more like a galaxy than a piece of wood. Some people said\nthat what science showed was that nothing was really solid, solidity was\nan illusion, but Eddington knew better than to go that far. Some people\nhave said that color is an illusion. Is it? Electromagnetic radiation in the\nnarrow range that accounts for human vision (the range in between\ninfrared and ultraviolet) is not made of little colored things, and atoms,\neven gold atoms, aren’t colored. But still, color is not an illusion in the\nsense that matters: nobody thinks Sony is lying when it says that its color\ntelevisions really show the world of color, or that Sherwin-Williams\nshould be sued for fraud for selling us many different colors in the form\nof paint. How about dollars? These days the vast majority of them aren’t\nmade of silver or even paper. They are virtual, made of information, not\nmaterial, just like poems and promises. Does that mean that they are an\nillusion? No, but don’t hunt for them among the molecules.\nSellars (1962, p. 1) famously said, “The aim of philosophy, abstractly\n",

An animal’s Umwelt\nconsists in the first place of affordances (Gibson, 1979), things to eat or\nmate with, or shun, openings to walk through or look out of, holes to hide\nin, things to stand on, and so forth. An organism’s Umwelt is in one sense\na n inner environment, a “subjective” and even “narcissistic” ontology,\ncomposed of only the things that most matter to it, but its Umwelt is not\nnecessarily inner or subjective in the sense of being conscious.

It’s the world we live in,\nthe world according to us.2 Like the daisy’s ontology, however, much of\nour manifest image has been shaped by natural selection over eons, and is\npart of our genetic heritage. One of my favorite examples of how\ndifferent an Umwelt can be compares an anteater to an insectivorous bird\n(Wimsatt, 1980). The bird tracks individual insects and must deal with\ntheir erratic flight patterns by having a high flicker-fusion rate (in effect\nit sees more “frames per second” than we do, and hence a movie would be\nlike a slide show to it). The anteater just averages over the whole ant-\ninfested area and lets its big tongue take up the slack. A philosopher\nmight say that “ant” for an anteater is a mass term, like “water” and “ice”\nand “furniture,” not a sortal (you can count them) like “olives” and\n“raindrops” and “chairs.” When an anteater sees a nice blob of ant, it\nslurps it up with its tongue, as oblivious to the individuals as we are to\nthe individual glucose molecules we slurp up when we eat a sweet.\nMost of our manifest image is not genetically inherited; it is somehow\ninculcated in our early childhood experience. Words are a very important\ncategory of thing for us, and are the medium through which much of our\nmanifest image is transmitted, but the capacity to categorize some events\nin the world as words, and our desire to speak, may well be at least partly\na genetically inherited talent—like the bird’s capacity to make out\nindividual flying insects, or a wasp’s desire to dig a nest. Even without\ngrammar to knit them together into sentences, words as mere labels can\nhelp bring important categories into sharply focused existence in our\nmanifest image: Mommy, doggie, cookie.

I coined the term in its current meaning in 1981, but it\napparently had an earlier incarnation in the writings of Wilhelm Wundt\nand Sigmund Freud and others (Volkpsychologie), where it meant\nsomething about national character (the Geist of the German Volk—you\ndon’t want to know). This was an antecedent I had missed, as did many\nothers who adopted the term. I proposed folk psychology as a term for the\ntalent we all have for interpreting the people around us—and the animals\nand the robots and even the lowly thermostats—as agents with\ninformation about the world they act in (beliefs) and the goals (desires)\nthey strive to achieve, choosing the most reasonable course of action,\ngiven their beliefs and desires.\nSome researchers like to call folk psychology “theory of mind” (or just\nTOM), but this strikes me as misleading, since it tends to prejudge the\nquestion of how we manage to have such a talent, suggesting that we\nhave, and apply, a theory. In a similar spirit, we would have to say that\nyou have a bicycle theory if you know how to ride a bicycle, and it’s your\nnutrition theory that accounts for your ability to avoid starving to death\nand refrain from eating sand. This doesn’t strike me as a useful way of\nthinking about these competences. Since everybody agrees that we have\nthe interpretive talent, and everybody does not agree about how we\nmanage to be so competent, I think it’s best to keep “theory” out of it and\nto use a somewhat more neutral term for the time being. Academic or\nscientific psychology is also in the business of explaining and predicting\nthe minds of others, and it really does have theories: behaviorism,\ncognitivism, neurocomputational models, Gestalt psychology, and a host\nof others. Folk psychology is a talent we excel in without formal\neducation. Folk physics then, in parallel fashion, is the talent we have for\nexpecting liquids to flow, unsupported things to drop, hot substances to\nburn us, water to quench our thirst, and rolling stones to gather no moss.\n",

Almost all of us are good at folk psychology. 1 We have a\ntalent for thinking of others (and ourselves) as having minds, a practice\nas effortless as breathing, most of the time. We depend on it without a\nqualm or a second thought, and it is stupendously reliable. Why is it so\neasy and how does it work? Here we need to pause and erect some more\nstaging, which will make life much easier for us as we proceed with our\nexplorations.\nHow does folk psychology work? We can get a good glimpse of the\nanswer by noting how it works when we apply it to things that aren’t\nother people. Suppose you are playing chess against a computer. You\nwant to win, and the only good way of working toward that goal is to try\nto anticipate the computer’s responses to your moves: “if I moved my\nbishop there, the computer would take it; if I moved the pawn instead, the\ncomputer would have to move its queen; . . .” How do you know what the\ncomputer would do? Have you looked inside? Have you studied its chess-\nplaying program? Of course not. You don’t have to. You make your\nconfident predictions on the quite obvious assumptions that the computer\n \n1. “knows” the rules and “knows how” to play chess,\n2. “wants” to win, and\n3. will “see” these possibilities and opportunities for what they are, and\nact accordingly (that is, rationally).\nIn other words, you assume the computer is a good chess player, or at\nleast not an idiotic, self-destructive chess player. You treat it, in other\nother words, as if it were a human being with a mind. In still further other\nwords, when you use folk psychology to anticipate and understand its\nmoves, you have adopted the intentional stance.\nThe intentional stance is the strategy of interpreting the behavior of an\nentity (person, animal, artifact, or whatever) by treating it as if it were a\nrational agent who governed its “choice” of “action” by a “consideration”\n",

Anything that is usefully and voluminously\npredictable from the intentional stance is, by definition, an intentional\nsystem, and as we shall see, many fascinating and complicated things that\ndon’t have brains or eyes or ears or hands, and hence really don’t have\nminds, are nevertheless intentional systems.

Let’s begin by identifying\nthree main stances (which could be subdivided further for some purposes,\nbut not ours here): the physical stance, the design stance, and the\nintentional stance.\nThe physical stance is simply the standard laborious method of the\nphysical sciences, in which we use whatever we know about the laws of\nphysics and the physical constitution of the things in question to devise\nour predictions. When I predict that a stone released from my hand will\nfall to the ground, I am using the physical stance. In general, for things\nthat are neither alive nor artifacts, the physical stance is the only\navailable strategy, though there are important exceptions, as we shall see.\nEvery physical thing, whether designed or alive or not, is subject to the\nlaws of physics and hence behaves in ways that in principle can be\nexplained and predicted from the physical stance. If the thing I release\nfrom my hand is an alarm clock or a goldfish, I make the same prediction\nabout its downward trajectory, on the same basis. Predicting the more\ninteresting behaviors of alarm clocks and goldfish from the physical\nstance is seldom practical.\nAlarm clocks, being designed objects (unlike a stone), are also\namenable to a fancier style of prediction—prediction from the design\nstance. Suppose I categorize a novel object as an alarm clock: I can\nquickly reason that if I depress a few buttons just so, then some time later\nthe alarm clock will make a loud noise. I don’t need to work out the\nspecific physical laws that explain this marvelous regularity; I simply\nassume that it has a particular design—the design we call an alarm clock\n—and that it will function properly, as designed. Design-stance\npredictions are riskier than physical-stance predictions because of the\nextra assumptions I have to take into account:\n",

When a\ndesigned thing is fairly complicated (a chainsaw in contrast to an ax, for\ninstance), the moderate price one pays in riskiness is more than\ncompensated for by the tremendous ease of prediction. Nobody would\nprefer to fall back on the fundamental laws of physics to predict the\nbehavior of a chain saw when there is a handy diagram of its moving\nparts available to consult instead.\nAn even riskier and swifter stance is our main topic, the intentional\nstance, a subspecies of the design stance in which the designed thing is\ntreated as an agent of sorts, with beliefs and desires and enough\nrationality to do what it ought to do given those beliefs and desires.

One of the clearest symptoms of autism, severe and\nmild, in its various forms, is difficulty with folk psychology. Those with autism who manage to\ninterpret other people at all, such as Temple Grandin, really do seem to rely on a hard-won\ntheory. Where we view others effortlessly and, indeed, involuntarily understand the meanings of\ngestures and smiles and circumstances, she has to deduce these implications of what she\nobserves. She has resourcefully gathered evidence so that she can identify the hallmarks of a\nfriendly greeting as opposed to a threat, and tell when people are agreeing on something. She\nhas taught herself to identify promises and purchases, telling jokes and telling lies. The\ncharacter Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory is a well-known fictional example of\nsomebody with Asperger’s syndrome, a mild form of autism, and we see and hear his brilliant\nscientific mind churning away, inferring the details of the situations he is confronted with as if\nhe were analyzing the effects of catalysts in chemical reactions in a test tube.

It is the aboutness alluded to in these idioms that not only raise\nlogical problems but also point to solutions. A belief or a sentence can be about something that\ndoes not exist, such as Santa Claus, and a desire can be for something that doesn’t exist: the\nFountain of Youth or just a cold glass of water in the middle of a desert. The intentional stance\nis about what agents are thinking about. It is not something that we intentionally adopt in the\nnormal course of things; it is typically involuntary and seldom noticed.\n3 My 1983 target article in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, “Intentional Systems in Cognitive\nEthology: The ‘Panglossian Paradigm’ Defended,” provides the details, accompanied by a\nfascinating chorus of objections and rebuttals.

If you think of the human nervous system as,\nsay, a huge telephone switchboard network (as thinkers liked to do as\nrecently as the 1950s and 1960s), you have the problem of the telephone\noperator at the center: Is his or her mind composed of a smaller telephone\nnetwork with its own central operator, whose mind in turn is composed of\n. . . ?

Experimental psychology is giving us an\never-more detailed catalogue of the competences and frailties of the mind\n—the triumphs of perception and the embarrassments of illusion, the\npace of language learning and the conditions of distraction, lust, fear, and\nmirth—and now, as “convinced materialists,” we need to figure out how\non earth the brain does it all, without postulating wonder tissue.\nAs our understanding grows, what counts as wonder tissue shifts. When\n“connectionist” and other “neural network” models burst on the scene in\nthe mid-1980s,1 they demonstrated learning capabilities and pattern-\nrecognition powers that nobody would have dared postulate in small\ntracts of neurons a few years earlier. We still don’t know exactly how—\nor even if—the brain exploits the computational powers exhibited by\nthese semi-realistic models, but it is now okay to postulate a\nconnectionist competence for some neural network that you can’t yet\nexplain as long as you are up-front about it and the competence is not\nclearly beyond the demonstrated range of feats.

THE SEVEN SECRETS OF\nCOMPUTER POWER REVEALED\n \nComputers have powers that in earlier centuries would have seemed\nmiraculous—“real magic”—but although many computer programs are\ndauntingly complicated, all of them are composed of steps that are\ncompletely explainable in very simple terms. There is no room for\nmysteries in what computers do. That very fact is part of the value of\ncomputers as thinking tools, and explaining—in outline—how this works\nis philosophically interesting in its own right. How computers do their\n“magic” is well worth understanding at an elementary level. This chapter\nprovides that demystification.\nWe start by considering what is probably the simplest imaginable\ncomputer, a register machine, to see just what its powers are and why.\nWe will then go on to see how a Turing machine, and a Von Neumann\nmachine (such as your laptop) are just like register machines, only more\nefficient. (Anything your laptop can do, a register machine can do, but\ndon’t hold your breath; it might take centuries.) Then we can understand\nhow other computer “architectures” could further multiply the speed and\ncapacity of our basic machine, the register machine. The architecture of\nthe human brain is, of course, one of the most interesting and important\narchitectures to consider.\nHang on. Am I claiming that your brain is just a gigantic computer? No\n—not yet in any case. I am pointing out that if your brain is a gigantic\ncomputer, then there will be a way of understanding all its activities with\nno residual mysteries—if only we can find it. Our method will be reverse\nengineering: studying a complicated system to uncover how it does what\nit does. Reverse engineering tells us how the heart executes its duties as a\npump and how the lungs gather oxygen and expel carbon dioxide.\nNeuroscience is the attempt to reverse engineer the brain. We know what\nbrains \nare for—for anticipating and guiding and remembering and\nlearning—but now we need to figure out how they accomplish all this.\nThis is a topic of passionate controversy.

We need\nto know what computers can do and how they do it before we can\nresponsibly address the question of whether or not our brains harbor and\nexploit incomprehensible or miraculous phenomena beyond the reach of\nall possible computers. The only satisfactory way of demonstrating that\nyour brain isn’t—couldn’t be—a computer would be to show either (1)\nthat some of its “moving parts” engage in sorts of information-handling\nactivities that no computers can engage in, or (2) that the simple\nactivities its parts do engage in cannot be composed, aggregated,\norchestrated, computer-fashion, into the mental feats we know and love.\nSome \nexperts—not \njust \nphilosophers, \nbut \nneuroscientists,\npsychologists, linguists, and even physicists—have argued that “the\ncomputer metaphor” for the human brain/mind is deeply misleading, and,\nmore dramatically, that brains can do things that computers can’t do.\nUsually, but not always, these criticisms presuppose a very naïve view of\nwhat a computer is or must be, and end up proving only the obvious (and\nirrelevant) truth, that brains can do lots of things that your laptop can’t do\n(given its meager supply of transducers and effectors, its paltry memory,\nits speed limit).

What they can do is solve many problems,\ncompute \nmany \nvalues \nsimultaneously, \nthanks \nto \n“quantum\nsuperposition,” the strange and delicate property in which an unobserved\nentity can be in “all possible” states at once, until observation brings\nabout “collapse of the wave packet.” (Consult your favorite popular\nphysics book or website for more on this.) Basically, a quantum computer\nis just the latest—very impressive—innovation in speed, a quantum leap,\none might say, in processing speed. A Turing machine chugging along on\nits paper tape, or a register machine running around incrementing and\ndecrementing single registers, has a very strict limit on what it can do in\npractically small chunks of time—minutes or hours or days. A\nsupercomputer like the Fujitsu K-computer can do all the same things\ntrillions of times faster, but that is still not fast enough to solve some\nproblems, especially in cryptography. That is where the speed bonus of\nquantum computers could pay off—if people can solve the ferociously\ndifficult engineering problems encountered in trying to make a stable,\npractical quantum computer. It may not be possible, in which case we\nmay have to settle for mere quadrillions of FLOPS.\n1 I am grateful to my colleague George Smith for introducing me to register machines, in an\nintroductory course on computers we co-taught at Tufts in the mid-1980s. He recognized the\ntremendous pedagogical potential of register machines, and developed the expository structure I\nadapt here for a slightly different audience. The Curricular Software Studio that George and I\nfounded at Tufts grew out of that course.\n2 Solutions to the problems in the exercises can be found in the appendix.\n3 This means the other exercises are compulsory! I mean it. If you want to take advantage of\nthis thinking tool, you have to practice, practice, practice until you become fluent. Working\nthrough the simple compulsory exercises may take you an extra hour or two, but it’s worth it.\n4 Ada Lovelace, daughter of the poet Lord Byron, was an amazing mathematician and much\n",

And instead of having to plug in a different\nattachment for each task, you open a different program—a very long\nstring of zeroes and ones—which changes all the necessary internal\nswitches to just the right settings to accomplish the job. Each of these\ndifferent systems of settings is a different machine—a different virtual\nmachine, a machine “made of instructions,” not gears and bearings, wires\nand pulleys.

There are actually several competing\nsenses of the term, and mine is perhaps the most commodious. What\nfollows is drawn, with revisions, from my book.\nDarwin discovered the power of an algorithm. An algorithm is a certain\nsort of formal process that can be counted on—logically—to yield a\ncertain sort of result whenever it is “run” or instantiated. Algorithms are\nnot new, and they were not new in Darwin’s day. Many familiar\narithmetic procedures, such as performing long division and balancing\nyour checkbook, are algorithms, and so are the decision procedures for\nplaying perfect tic-tac-toe and for putting a list of words into alphabetical\norder. What is relatively new—and permits us valuable hindsight on\nDarwin’s discovery—is the theoretical reflection by mathematicians and\nlogicians on the nature and power of algorithms in general, a twentieth-\ncentury development that led to the birth of the computer, which in turn\nhas led to a much deeper and more lively understanding of the powers of\nalgorithms in general.\nThe term algorithm descends, via Latin (algorismi) to early English\n(algorism and, mistakenly therefrom, algorithm), from the name of a\nPersian \nmathematician, \nMûusâ \nal-Khowârizm, \nwhose \nbook \non\narithmetical procedures written in the ninth century was translated into\nLatin in the eleventh century by either Adelard of Bath or Robert of\nChester. The idea that an algorithm is a foolproof and somehow\n“mechanical” procedure has been present for centuries, but it was the\npioneering work of Alan Turing, Kurt Gödel, and Alonzo Church in the\n1930s that more or less fixed our current understanding of the term.\n",

The power of the\nprocedure is due to its logical structure, not the causal powers of the\nmaterials used in the instantiation, just so long as those causal\npowers permit the prescribed steps to be followed exactly.\n(2) Underlying mindlessness: Although the overall design of the\nprocedure may be brilliant, or yield brilliant results, each constituent\nstep, and the transition between steps, is utterly simple. How\nsimple? Simple enough for a dutiful idiot—or for a straightforward\nmechanical device—to perform. The standard textbook analogy\nnotes that algorithms are recipes of sorts, designed to be followed by\nnovice cooks. A recipe book written for great chefs might include\nthe phrase “poach the fish in a suitable wine until almost done,” but\nan algorithm for the same process might begin “choose a white wine\nthat says ‘dry’ on the label; take a corkscrew and open the bottle;\npour an inch of wine in the bottom of a pan; turn the burner under\nthe pan on high; . . .”—a tedious breakdown of the process into dead-\nsimple steps, requiring no wise decisions or delicate judgments or\nintuitions on the part of the recipe-reader.\n(3) Guaranteed results: Whatever it is that an algorithm does, it\nalways does it, if it is executed without misstep. An algorithm is a\nfoolproof recipe.\n \nIt is easy to see how these features made the computer possible.

It is often wise to study a dead-simple\nexample in some detail, to get a secure grip on our concepts before\ntackling a mind-buster. (In the field of artificial intelligence, these are\nnicely known as toy problems. First you solve the toy problem before\ntackling the gnarly great real-world problem.) So this is a story—made\nup, for simplicity’s sake, but otherwise realistic—about how human\nelevator operators got replaced by computer chips.\nIn my youth there were elevator operators, people whose job was to go\nup and down in an elevator all day, stopping at the right floors to take on\nand let off passengers. In the early days they manipulated a curious\nhandle that could be swung clockwise or counterclockwise to make the\nelevator go up or down, and they needed skill to stop the elevator at just\nthe right height. People often had to step up or down an inch or two upon\nentering and leaving, and operators always warned people about this.\nThey had lots of rules about what to say when, and which floors to go to\nfirst, and how to open the doors, and so forth. Their training consisted in\nmemorizing the rules and then practicing: following the rules until it\nbecame second nature. The rules themselves had been hammered out over\nthe years in a design process that made a host of slight revisions and\nimprovements. Let’s suppose that this process had more or less settled\ndown, leaving an ideal rulebook as its product. It worked wonderfully.\nAnybody who followed the rules exactly was an excellent elevator\noperator.\nNow imagine what happened when it became possible for a simple\ncomputer program to take over all the control tasks of the operator.

In the process they can clean up some of\nthe untidiness in the rulebook. For instance, if they build in sensors to\nensure that the elevator always stops at exactly the right level, they can\neliminate the loop that requires the operator to say, “Please step up” or\n“Please step down,” but they might leave intact a simple (recorded voice\nsaying), “[N]th floor; watch your step.” Then they write out a sketch of\nthe program in what is often called pseudo-code, a sort of mongrel\nlanguage that is halfway between everyday human language and the more\ndemanding system of source code.

The\nbrain could be seen to be composed of lots of different, curiously shaped\norgans, in left and right pairs, given vivid names by early anatomists—\nthe hippocampus (seahorse), the amygdala (almond), the wrinkly cortex\n(bark)—but what on earth did these parts do? They didn’t digest food or\npurify the blood, did they? Was the brain just an organ for cooling the\nblood, a sort of radiator, as Aristotle thought? The parts were connected\nby nerve fibers, so perhaps they communicated with each other somehow.\nDescartes suggested that some nerve fibers were like bell-pull wires—\nwhen you tugged at one end, something happened at the other end, but\nwhat, exactly? A bell ringing wouldn’t seem to get you any closer to\nunderstanding the brain as the mind, and nobody had any better ideas.1\nThen along came Turing, building on a tradition that went back to\nBabbage and Pascal and Leibniz and others, with the suggestion that a\nbrain could be composed of simple parts that were ultimately just\nmechanical (like a mousetrap, a ringing bell, a lock and key, a synapse),\nbut if these parts were organized to interact together in clever ways, they\nmight actually be able to do something intelligent on their own, without\nhuman intervention, and without any ghosts in the machine to guide them\nalong. They might compute. Before Turing hit on his idea, “computer”\nwas a job title; industry and government hired thousands of people to be\ncomputers, calculating tables for use in business, navigation, gunnery,\nand banking, for instance. Maybe, he surmised, the brain is itself like a\n(human) computer; maybe it processes information by slavishly\nfollowing huge lists of very simple instructions (like Inc and Deb). Once\nthe early theorists of cognitive science, Alan Turing and John von\nNeumann, the creator of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, and the creator of\ninformation theory, Claude Shannon, as well as many others, articulated\nthe idea, it could even seem obviously right—how could we not have seen\n",

The key\ninnovation in Turing’s vision was that it eliminated the awkward element\nthat was all too evident in earlier imaginings of information-processing:\njunctures that required a clerk or translator or librarian, that required, in\nshort, some kind of understander to appreciate the import of the signals.\nTuring saw that in one sense this was inescapable: intelligent processes\nwould always require choosing one course or another on the basis of the\ndiscrimination of some difference in the signal. But he could reduce this\nunderstanding to the barest minimum: conditional branching, the\nmindless process by which a device decides (sorta decides) to go left\nrather than right because it senses (sorta senses) 1 rather than 0, A rather\nthan B, x rather than y. That, and arithmetic, were all you needed. You\ncould then build up devices of any level of discernment by piling virtual\nmachines on top of virtual machines on top of virtual machines—to put it\nanachronistically. This vision has been tempting for more than fifty\nyears, but the details, as we’ve already begun to see, are not falling into\nplace easily.

We need to remind ourselves of the fundamental\nfeatures of computers so that we can consider more biologically realistic\nalternatives to the businesslike architectures that are featured in our\nstereotypes.\nThe point of this interlude has been to clarify, and add just enough\ndetail to, that vision so that you can use it as a thinking tool, an\nimagination prosthesis to help you understand the issues we are now\ngoing to address: first, a bit more on how meanings might reside in brains\n(and other machines), and then how such clever architectures could get\ndesigned by evolution without assistance from any Master Programmer\nor Intelligent Designer.

Brain-writing cannot\njust install a false belief, and people can share a belief (about that murder\nin London, for instance) without—apparently—having to share a formula\nin Brainish. But what else could store information in the brain? We\nhuman beings can learn things “piecemeal,” so there must be some way\nof adding independent facts roughly one at a time.\nEconomists (and others) often like to point out that you cannot do just\none thing. Doing “one thing” always has consequences. Similarly, the\nidea that you can learn just one thing is dubious. But to a first\napproximation you can. You earlier learned in these pages that there is a\nmammal called a pudu. Unless you paused to check on this, you probably\ncan’t affirm anything else about pudus, aside from the fact that they nurse\ntheir young, have backbones, and are relatively rare (since otherwise you\nsurely would have heard of them). It’s no mystery how you learned this:\nyou read a sentence and believed it.

The idea\nthat knowledge or belief or learning has to be decomposable into\nsentence-sized gobbets is probably an illusion of anthropomorphism. We\nhuman beings encounter lots of declarative sentences, spoken and written,\nin the course of a day, and we thereby come to know all manner of facts\n(and believe a smattering of falsehoods). Some we store in libraries and\narchives, and some we store only in our brains. We seldom memorize the\nactual sentences, word for word, but when we salt away the gist of an\nencountered sentence, it must be—mustn’t it?—a matter of storing a\nsentence-like something-or-other, a formula in Brainish.

John Searle\n(1980) coined the term, and the sharp distinction he draws between\noriginal and derived intentionality is on the face of it intuitively\nsatisfying and even deeply compelling. The doctrine of original\nintentionality is the claim that whereas some of our artifacts may have a\nkind of intentionality derived from us—our books and movies, our\ncomputers and signposts, for instance—we have original (or intrinsic)\nintentionality, utterly underived. For example, the printed words on this\npage are about philosophy only because we readers and writers of English\nhave thoughts and beliefs about philosophy that we contrive to convey\nusing these trails of ink, which wouldn’t be about anything at all without\nus word-users. Our thoughts and beliefs, in contrast, mean what they\nmean independently of any ulterior users; they exhibit original\nintentionality, and are the source ultimately of all the derived\nintentionality in many of our artifacts. These include not just words and\nsentences and books, but maps, movies, paintings, signs, symbols,\ndiagrams and other technical representations, and, importantly,\ncomputers. Both a shopping list on a scrap of paper and a shopping list on\nyour iPhone are about groceries only in virtue of the use you make of\nthese symbol structures, the interpretation you bestow on them, in aid of\nyour desire to buy groceries and your belief that the supermarket is the\nplace to go, which are about groceries more directly and originally.\nAristotle said that God is the Unmoved Mover, and this doctrine\nannounces that we are the Unmeant Meaners.\nWe can all agree with Searle that nothing has intrinsic intentionality\njust in virtue of its physical shape or other such properties.

And—to satisfy the curious,\nalthough it is strictly irrelevant to the example—the current (2011)\nexchange rate is one balboa equals $.98, so a quarter-balboa is, today,\never so slightly less valuable than a U.S. quarter.\nSuch a two-bitser, whisked off to Panama, would still normally go into\na certain physical state—the state with the physical features by which we\nused to identify state Q—whenever a U.S. quarter or an object of kind K\nor a Panamanian quarter-balboa is inserted into it, but now a different set\nof such occasions count as the mistakes. In the new environment, U.S.\nquarters count as slugs, like objects of kind K, as inducers of error,\nmisperception, misrepresentation. After all, back in the United States a\nPanamanian quarter-balboa is a kind of slug.\n",

The physical state in which the device\n“accepts” coins still occurs, but should we now say that we identify that\nphysical state as “realizing” a new state, QB, instead? Well, there is\nconsiderable freedom about what we should say, since after all a two-\nbitser is just an artifact, and talking about its perceptions and\nmisperceptions, its veridical and non-veridical states—its intentionality,\nin short—is “just metaphor.” The two-bitser’s internal state, call it what\nyou like, doesn’t really (originally) mean either “U.S. quarter here now”\nor “Panamanian quarter-balboa here now.” It doesn’t really mean\nanything—so Searle, Fodor, and Kripke (inter alia) would insist. Its\ninternal state only sorta means something, but that will be enough to\nraise some problems that can also arise for us enjoyers of original\nintentionality. Let’s look at the details.\nThe two-bitser was originally designed to be a detector of U.S. quarters.\nThat was its “proper function” (Millikan, 1984), and, quite literally, its\nraison d’être, its reason for existing. No one would have bothered\nbringing it into existence had not this purpose occurred to them. And\ngiven that this historical fact about its origin licenses a certain way of\nspeaking, such a device may be primarily or properly characterized as a\ntwo-bitser, a thing whose function is to detect quarters, so that relative to\nthat function we can identify both its veridical states (when it gets things\nright) and its errors.\nThis would not prevent a two-bitser from being wrested from its home\nniche and pressed into service with a new purpose—whatever new\npurpose the laws of physics certify it would reliably serve—as a K-\ndetector, a quarter-balboa-detector, a doorstop, a deadly weapon. In its\nnew role there might be a brief period of confusion or indeterminacy.\nHow long a track record must something accumulate before it is no\nlonger a two-bitser, but rather a quarter-balboa-detector (a q-balber)—or\na doorstop or a deadly weapon?2 On its very debut as a q-balber, after ten\nyears of faithful service as a two-bitser, is its state Q already a veridical\ndetection of a quarter-balboa, or might there be a sort of force-of-habit\n",

The main drawback to\nsuch an installation, or “plant,” is that it cannot be moved if harm comes\nits way—if, say, someone decides to build a freeway right where it is\nlocated.

In short,\nbuild a giant robot and install the capsule (with you inside) in it.\nThese two basic strategies are obviously copied from nature: they\ncorrespond roughly to the division between plants and animals. A third\noption from nature, a hardened spore or seed that can survive indefinitely\ninside its armor, is not available to you, since your life-support system\nhas high energy demands, and spores are as inert and low energy as\nnature can make them.

And it is only relative to\njust such design “choices” or evolution-“endorsed” purposes—raisons\nd’être—that we can identify behaviors, actions, perceptions, beliefs, or\nany of the other categories of folk psychology.5\nThe idea that we are artifacts designed by natural selection is both\ncompelling and familiar; some would go so far as to say that it is quite\n",

My hunch is\nthat it has two rather unobvious implications that some find terribly\nunpalatable. First, if we are “just” artifacts, then what our innermost\nthoughts mean—and whether they mean anything at all—is something\nabout which we, the very thinkers of those thoughts, have no special\nauthority. The two-bitser turns into a q-balber without ever changing its\ninner nature; the state that used to mean one thing now means another.\nThe same thing could in principle happen to us, if we are just artifacts, if\nour own intentionality is thus not original but derived. (Jones, for\ninstance, is not authoritative about whether he is thinking about horses or\nschmorses.) Second, if we are such artifacts, not only have we no\nguaranteed privileged access to deeper facts that fix the meanings of our\nthoughts, but there are no such deeper facts. Sometimes functional\ninterpretation is obvious (the heart is obviously a pump; the eye is\nobviously for seeing), but when it is not, when we go to read Mother\nNature’s mind, there is no text to be interpreted. When “the fact of the\nmatter” about proper function is controversial—when more than one\ninterpretation is well supported—there simply is no fact of the matter.\n1 I probably shouldn’t have used this obsolete slang term for a quarter-detector when I first\ncreated this intuition pump, but I did, and the term has had a fair amount of, well, currency, so\nlet’s stay with it. The obscure origin of the term “two bits” for a U.S. quarter takes us back to\n“pieces of eight” and doubloons and other such relics of pirate days.\n2 A sad iron—like the one your great grandmother used to press the family clothes—makes a\nfine doorstop. If you hunt for one in antique shops and “collectibles” websites, make sure you\nget an authentic one, not a replica; some for sale are just iron doorstops, cast in the shape of\nantique sad irons. A hundred years from now somebody may manufacture quaint doorstops that\nlook just like two-bitsers—you know, the devices your great grandparents used back when\ncoins were used for money.\n3 Philosopher Hilary Putnam (1975) invented Twin Earth many years ago, and my intuition\npump is carefully modeled to reproduce the relevant details of his. My two-bitser tale is really\njust an elaborate resetting of the knobs of his intuition pump. There have been dozens or maybe\neven hundreds of other variations discussed by philosophers in the last thirty-five years. In its\noriginal telling, Putnam chose water on Earth and ersatz water (composed of XYZ, not H2O) on\nTwin Earth, but this raises complications not relevant to our use of the intuition pump, so let\nschmorses be the quarter-balboa analogues in this telling.\n",

RADICAL TRANSLATION AND A QUINIAN CROSSWORD PUZZLE\n \nThe claim that when two equally good functional interpretations clash\nthere are no deeper facts that could settle the matter has been most\nmemorably and ably defended by philosopher W.

Imagine discovering\nan isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, let’s say, inhabited\nby people from who knows where, speaking a language that nobody else\nspeaks. With no bilingual interpreters available to help, the\nanthropologists or linguists must figure out this language from\nobservation and trial-and-error interaction with the natives, a task Quine\ncalled “radical translation.” In principle, Quine argued, two such\ninvestigators, given the task of deriving a translation manual for this\nexotic tongue, could arrive at substantially different but equally good\ntranslation manuals, which assigned different meanings to utterances\nmade by the natives, and where there could be no fact of the matter about\nwhich translation was correct! To many philosophers, this idea has\nseemed too radical to take seriously—and so they simply ignore it and\npersist in their traditional ways. Here is a thinking tool designed to make\nthe idea seem at least plausible, if not downright obvious.

Donald Davidson, one of America’s best\ntwentieth-century philosophers, once told me that he regretted inventing\nthis intuition pump, since it instigated such an excessive and only\nintermittently illuminating wrangle. Here is Swampman, one of\nphilosophy’s favorites—if not Davidson’s (1987):\nSuppose lightning strikes a dead tree in a swamp; I am standing\nnearby. My body is reduced to its elements, while entirely by\ncoincidence (and out of different molecules) the tree is turned into\nmy physical replica. My replica, The Swampman, moves exactly as I\ndid; according to its nature it departs the swamp, encounters and\nseems to recognize my friends, and appears to return their greetings\nin English. It moves into my house and seems to write articles on\nradical interpretation. No one can tell the difference.\nBut there is a difference. My replica can’t recognize my friends; it\ncan’t recognize anything, since it never cognized anything in the\nfirst place. It can’t know my friends’ names (though of course it\nseems to); it can’t remember my house. It can’t mean what I do by\nthe word “house,” for example, since the sound “house” it makes\nwas not learned in a context that would give it the right meaning—or\nany meaning at all. Indeed, I don’t see how my replica can be said to\nmean anything by the sounds it makes, nor to have any thoughts.

They didn’t suspect any occult causes to be operating,\nand, for instance, when they arranged to input the same sequence of\n10,000 bits again and again, the program in box B always yielded the\nsame output, red or green.\nBut this was mildly puzzling, because although box B always gave the\nsame output, it didn’t do so by going through the same intermediate\nsteps. In fact, it almost always passed through different physical states\nbefore yielding the same output. This in itself was no mystery, because\nthe program kept a copy of each input it received, and so, when the same\ninput arrived a second or third or thousandth time, the state of the\nmemory of the computer was slightly different each time.

But of course they didn’t test all possible strings—only strings\nthat had been emitted by box A.\nThe scientists decided to test their hypothesis by disconnecting A from\nB temporarily and inserting variations on A’s output strings to B. To their\npuzzlement and dismay, they discovered that almost always, when they\ntampered with a string from A, the amber light flashed! It was almost as\nif box B had detected their intervention. There was no doubt, however,\nthat box B would readily accept man-made versions of red strings by\nflashing red, and man-made versions of green strings by flashing green. It\nwas only when a bit—or more than one bit—was changed in a red or a\ngreen string that the amber light usually—almost always—came on.\n“You’ve killed it!” somebody once blurted out, after watching a\n“tampered” red string turn into an amber string, and this led to a flurry of\nspeculation that red and green strings were in some sense alive—perhaps\nmale and female—while amber strings were dead strings. As appealing as\nthis hypothesis was, it did not turn out to lead anywhere, although a flurry\nof experimentation with a few billion random variations on strings 10,000\nbits long did strongly suggest to the scientists that there were really three\nvarieties of strings—red strings, green strings, and amber strings—and\namber strings outnumbered the red and green strings by many, many\norders of magnitude (see chapter 35 for more on this). Almost all strings\nwere amber strings. That made the red/green regularity they had\ndiscovered all the more exciting and puzzling.\nWhat was it about the red strings that turned on the red light and the\ngreen strings that turned on the green light? Of course in each particular\ncase, there was no mystery at all. The scientists could trace the causation\nof each particular string through the supercomputer in B and see that,\nwith gratifying determinism, it produced its red or green or amber light,\nas the case might be.

They opened it up and\nfound another supercomputer, of a different make and model and running\na different gigantic program, but also just a garden-variety digital\ncomputer. They soon determined that there was an internal “clock”\nticking away millions of times a second, and whenever they pushed either\nbutton, the first thing the computer did was take the “time” from the\nclock (e.g., 101101010101010111) and break it up into strings, which it\nthen used to determine which subroutines to call in which order, and\nwhich part of its memory to access first in the course of its preparation of\na bit string to send down the wire.\nThe scientists were able to figure out that it was this clock-consulting\n(which was as good as random) that virtually guaranteed that the same bit\nstring was never sent out twice. But in spite of this randomness, or\npseudo-randomness, it remained true that whenever they pushed button α,\nthe bit string the computer concocted turned out to be red, and whenever\nthey pushed button β, the bit string eventually sent turned out to be green.\nActually, the scientists did find a few anomalous cases: in roughly one in\na billion trials, pushing the α button caused a green string to be emitted,\nor pushing the β button caused a red string to be emitted. This tiny\nblemish in perfection only whetted the scientists’ appetite for an\nexplanation of the regularity.\nAnd then one day, along came the two AI hackers who had built the\nboxes, and they explained it all. (Do not read on if you want to figure out\nthe mystery for yourself.) Al, who had built box A, had been working for\nyears on an “expert system”—a database containing “true propositions”\nabout everything under the sun, and an inference engine to deduce further\nimplications from the axioms that composed the database.

The systems weren’t actually very good at solving\ninteresting problems, or “thinking,” or “finding creative solutions to\nproblems.” All they were good at, thanks to their inference engines, was\ngenerating lots and lots of true sentences (in their respective languages),\nand testing input sentences (in their respective languages) for truth and\nfalsity, relative to their sorta knowledge.

Since both databases were composed of truths,\nand roughly the same truths, thanks to their inference engines, whenever\nA sent B something A “believed,” B “believed” it too, and signaled this\nby flashing a red light. Whenever A sent B what A took to be a falsehood,\nB announced that it judged that this was indeed a falsehood by flashing a\ngreen light.\nAnd whenever anyone tampered with the transmission, this almost\nalways resulted in a string that was not a well-formed sentence of\nEnglish, unless all the tampering occurred only in the random junk at the\n",

Suddenly, the search that had eluded the\nscientists for years became child’s play. Anyone could compose red\nstrings ad nauseam. Just write down the ASCII code for “Houses are\nbigger than peanuts” or “Whales don’t fly” or “Three times four is two\nless than two times seven,” for instance. If you wanted a green string, try\n“Nine is less than eight” or “New York is the capital of Spain.”\nPhilosophers soon hit on some cute tricks, such as finding strings that\nwere red the first hundred times they were given to B but green thereafter\n(e.g., the ASCII for “This sentence has been sent to you for evaluation\nless than a hundred and one times”).\nBut, said some philosophers, the string properties red and green are not\nreally truth in English and falsity in English. After all, there are English\ntruths whose ASCII expression takes millions of bits, and besides, in\nspite of their best efforts, Al and Bo didn’t always insert facts in their\nprograms. For example, some of what had passed for common knowledge\nwhen they were working on their databases had since been disproved.\nThere were lots of reasons why the string property—the causal property\n—of redness was not quite exactly the property of truth in English. So,\nperhaps red could be better defined as a relatively short expression in\nEnglish ASCII of something sorta believed true by box B (whose sorta\nbeliefs are almost all true). This satisfied some, but others picked nits,\ninsisting, for various reasons, that this definition was inexact, or had\ncounterexamples that could not be ruled out in any non–ad hoc way, and\nso forth. But as Al and Bo pointed out, there were no better candidate\ndescriptions of the property to be found, and hadn’t the scientists been\nyearning for just such an explanation?

In either case, the tool is a sort of lever, like a seesaw—\nif one side goes up, the other side must go down—but only if the tool\ncan’t bend or break in the middle.

Yes, so\ndifferent, in fact, that even a rather small fragment of DNA found at a\ncrime scene is enough to identify its owner with over 99 percent\ncertainty. And yet human DNA is also so similar that scientists can\ndistinguish it from the DNA of other species given only fragments of a\ncomplete genome. How is this possible? How can our personal DNA be\nso different and yet so similar? A good way to understand this surprising\nfact is by comparing DNA with the texts of books, and the Argentine\nwriter Jorge Luis Borges (1962) has given us a little fable, “The Library\nof Babel,” that vividly illustrates the way this difference and similarity\ncan coexist. Borges tells of the forlorn explorations and speculations of\npeople who find themselves living in a vast storehouse of books,\nstructured like a honeycomb, composed of thousands (or millions or\nbillions) of hexagonal air shafts surrounded by balconies lined with\nshelves. Standing at a railing and looking up or down, no one can see a\ntop or bottom to these shafts. And nobody has ever found a shaft that isn’t\nsurrounded by six neighboring shafts. The people wonder, Is the\nwarehouse infinite? Eventually they decide that it is not, but it might as\nwell be, for it seems that on its shelves—in no order, alas—lie all the\npossible books.\nSuppose that each book is five hundred pages long, and each page\nconsists of forty lines, with fifty spaces for each line, so there are two\nthousand character-spaces per page. Each space either is blank or has a\ncharacter printed on it, chosen from a set of one hundred characters (the\nuppercase and lowercase letters of English and other European languages,\nplus the blank and punctuation marks).1 Somewhere in the Library of\nBabel is a volume consisting entirely of blank pages, and another volume\nis all question marks, but the vast majority consist of typographical\ngibberish; no rules of spelling or grammar, to say nothing of sense,\n",

Some books may get used more than\nonce. The most profligate case is the easiest to understand: since there are volumes that contain\na single character and are otherwise blank, repeated use of these one hundred volumes will\ncreate any text of any length. As Quine (1987) pointed out in his informative and amusing essay\n“Universal Library,” if you avail yourself of this strategy of reusing volumes, and translate\neverything into the ASCII code your word-processor uses, you can store the whole Library of\nBabel in two extremely slender volumes, in one of which is printed a 0 and in the other of\nwhich appears a 1!

The text goes on: “Feel absolutely free to.

I would\nnot ordinarily insert such a long quotation of somebody else’s work in a\nbook of mine, but I found that my attempts at paraphrasing this passage\ninvariably sacrificed clarity and vividness for a smidgen of originality,\nso, with his permission, I am passing along the unmutated version as it\nappears in Dawkins’s book.\nMost of the genome that we sequence is not the book of instructions,\nor master computer program, for building a human or a mouse,\nalthough parts of it are. If it were, we might indeed expect our\nprogram to be larger than the mouse’s. But most of the genome is\nmore like the dictionary of words available for writing the book of\ninstructions—or, we shall soon see, the set of subroutines that are\ncalled by the master program. As Ridley says, the list of words in\nDavid Copperfield is almost the same as the list of words in The\nCatcher in the Rye. Both draw upon the vocabulary of an educated\nnative speaker of English. The difference between the two books is\nthe order in which those words are strung together.\nWhen a person is made, or when a mouse is made, both\nembryologies draw upon the same dictionary of genes: the normal\nvocabulary of mammalian embryologies. The difference between a\nperson and a mouse comes out of the different orders with which the\ngenes, drawn from that shared mammalian vocabulary, are deployed,\nthe different places in the body where this happens and its timing.\nAll this is under the control of particular genes whose business it is\nto turn other genes on, in complicated and exquisitely timed\n",

Let us understand that a\nskyhook is a “mind-first” force or power or process, an exception to the\nprinciple that all design, and apparent design, is ultimately the result of\nmindless, motiveless mechanicity. A crane, in contrast, is a subprocess,\nor a special feature of a design process that can be demonstrated to\npermit the local speeding up of the basic, slow process of natural\nselection, and that can be demonstrated to be itself the predictable (or\nretrospectively explicable) product of the basic process. Some cranes are\nobvious and uncontroversial; others are still being argued about, very\nfruitfully. Just to give a general sense of the breadth and application of\nthe concept, let me point to three very different examples.\nSymbiosis is a crane. One of my favorite examples is the symbiotic\norigin of the eukaryotic cell. If you look at the Tree of Life (facing p.\n241), you will notice that the glorious fan-out of multicellular life,\nincluding all plants and animals, occurs after the evolution of eukaryotes.\nFor about a billion years on this planet, the only living things were\nsingle-celled organisms, bacteria and archaea, together known as\nprokaryotes. Then one lucky day, one prokaryote happened to bump into\nanother (it no doubt happened very often then, as it still does today), and\ninstead of one of them engulfing and dismantling the other (eating it), or\nrepelling it, the two joined forces, forming a brand new kind of living\nthing, with (roughly) twice as many working parts and a greater variety of\nworking parts. Two R & D lineages that had been chugging along\nseparately for millions of years, each honing its own peculiar talents,\ncame together and the result was—happened to be—an overnight success.\n(“Technology transfer” does not always or even often yield good results,\nbut when it does, it can be spectacular.) Neither lineage had to go to the\nplodding trouble of reinventing all the tricks and systems of the other,\nand since the combination of their talents happened to be a net gain\n",

(It would be gratifying to report that the origin\nof the bacterial flagellum, long the flagship example of “irreducible\ncomplexity” among the Intelligent Design crowd, has also proved to be\ndue to the helping crane of symbiosis, and although Lynn Margulis, the\nlate biologist and champion of the symbiotic origin of the eukaryotes,\nvigorously defended this claim, the evidence currently favors alternative\nevolutionary accounts of the source of the flagellum. Given this\nembarrassment of riches, the claim that flagella need a skyhook is\nlooking particularly forlorn now.)\nAs we can see at a glance in the Tree of Life, eukaryotes set the stage\nfor all of multicellular life. All the multicolored lineages to the right of\nthe bacteria and archaea are eukaryotes. To a first approximation, every\nliving thing that can be seen by the naked eye is a eukaryote. The\neukaryotic revolution opened up huge regions of Design Space, but it did\nnot happen in order to make all these designs accessible. Cranes must be\n“paid for” locally, in terms of the immediate benefits they convey to\nthose that have the design innovations. But once established they can\nhave profound further effects.

Species\nthat reproduce sexually can move through Design Space at a greater\nspeed than species that reproduce asexually. Moreover, they can\n“discern” design improvements along the way that are all but “invisible”\nto asexually reproducing species (Holland, 1975). This cannot be the\nraison d’être of sex, however.

COMPETENCE WITHOUT COMPREHENSION\n \nMacKenzie described Darwin’s idea of Absolute Ignorance being the\nsource of “all the achievements of creative skill” as a “strange inversion\nof reasoning,” since it turns upside down one of the most “obvious” ideas\nwe have: comprehension is the source of competence. Why do we send\nour children to school, and why do we emphasize “concepts” over “rote\nlearning”? Because we think that the best route to competence, in any\nsphere of activity, is comprehension. Don’t settle for being a mindless\ndrudge! Understand the principles of whatever we’re doing so we can do\nit better! This is surely excellent advice in most arenas of human activity.\nWe recognize extreme exceptions, such as gifted musicians who “play by\near” and can’t read a note of music, or natural athletes who always seem\nto do the best thing but can’t explain how or why they do it, and hence\ncan’t coach others. Then there are “idiot savants” with bizarre\ncombinations of incompetence in most regards and superhuman prowess\nin some limited domain. But in general, the rule of thumb is hard to deny:\ncomprehension is usually the key to (human) competence.\nAnd Darwin really does invert that reasoning, showing, as MacKenzie\nso vividly put it, that Absolute Ignorance is the artificer. The process of\nnatural selection is breathtakingly competent—think of Orgel’s Second\nLaw—but utterly mindless. Moreover, the organisms it designs get the\nbenefits of all their exquisite equipment without needing to understand\nwhy or how they are so gifted. My favorite example is the cuckoo.\nCuckoos are brood parasites that don’t make their own nests. Instead, the\nfemale cuckoo surreptitiously lays her egg in the nest of a host pair of\nsome other species of birds, where it awaits the attentions of its\nunwittingly adoptive parents. Often, the female cuckoo will roll one of\nthe host eggs out of the nest—just in case the host parents can count! And\nas soon as the cuckoo chick is hatched (and it tends to incubate more\nquickly than the host eggs), the fledgling cuckoo goes to great efforts to\nroll any remaining eggs out of the nest! Why? To maximize the attention\nit will get from its adoptive parents.\n",

Some\nmembers of the population do well (at multiplying); most do not. In each\ncase we can ask why. Why did this one have surviving offspring while\nthese others did not? In many cases, most cases, there is no reason at all;\nit’s just dumb luck, good or bad. But if there is a subset, perhaps a very\nsmall one, of cases in which there is an answer, a difference that happens\nto make a difference, then what those cases have in common provides the\ngerm of a reason.

DO LOCUSTS UNDERSTAND PRIME NUMBERS?\n \nJust to drive home the point about the independence of numbers and\nnumerals, free-floating rationales and represented reasoning, consider the\ncase of the seventeen-year locusts. In 1977, Stephen Jay Gould wrote an\ninsightful and admiring chapter about the curious fact that cicadas (such\nas the “seventeen-year locust”) have reproductive cycles with lengths, in\nyears, equal to prime numbers—thirteen years, or seventeen, but never\nfifteen or sixteen, for instance. “As evolutionists,” Gould (p. 99) says,\n“we seek answers to the question, why. Why, in particular, should such\nstriking synchronicity evolve, and why should the period between\nepisodes of sexual reproduction be so long?” The answer—which makes\nbeautiful sense, in retrospect—is that by having a large prime number of\nyears between appearances, the cicadas minimize the likelihood of being\ndiscovered and later tracked as a predictable feast by predators who\nthemselves show up every two years, or three years, or five years. If the\ncicadas had a periodicity of, say, sixteen years, then they would be a rare\ntreat for predators who showed up every year, but a more reliable source\nof food for predators who showed up every two or four years, and an\neven-money gamble for predators who got in phase with them on an\neight-year schedule. If the length of their reproductive period is not a\nmultiple of any lower number, however, they are not worth “trying” to\ntrack for any species that isn’t lucky enough to have exactly the same\nperiodicity (or some multiple of it—the mythical Thirty-Four-Year\nLocust-Muncher would be in fat city).\nIt should be clear that the soundness of this explanation (which may not\nyet be established) does not depend on any hypothesis suggesting that\nlocusts understand arithmetic, let alone prime numbers. Nor does it\ndepend on the process of natural selection understanding prime numbers.\nThe mindless, uncomprehending process of natural selection can exploit\nthis important property of some numbers without having to understand it\nat all.

You didn’t have to have a semantic or intentional\ninterpretation of the boxes to see it: a caused red, and b caused green—an\nobvious pattern in need of explanation. In each instance of button-\npressing, the scientists understood exactly how each step in the\ncomputing and transmitting process worked, but they couldn’t explain the\ngeneralization. You do need a semantic interpretation to explain why the\nregularity exists. In other words, the “macro-causal” level at which the\nexplanation is expressed does not “reduce” to the “micro-causal” level.\nHere is another instance of this very general phenomenon. You have\nprobably seen video of gazelles being chased across the plain by a\npredator, and noticed that some of the gazelles are leaping high into the\nair during their attempts to escape their pursuer. This is called stotting.\nWhy do gazelles stot? It is clearly beneficial, because gazelles that stot\nseldom get caught and eaten. This is a causal regularity that has been\ncarefully observed, just like the regularity between buttons and lights.\nAnd it too can baffle. No account of the actions of all the proteins in all\nthe cells of all the gazelles and the predators chasing them could reveal\nwhy this regularity exists. For that we need the branch of evolutionary\ntheory known as costly signaling theory (Zahavi, 1987; FitzGibbon and\nFanshawe, 1988). The strongest and fastest of the gazelles stot to\nadvertise their fitness to the pursuer, signaling in effect, “Don’t bother\nchasing me; I’m too hard to catch; concentrate on one of my cousins who\nisn’t able to stot—a much easier meal!” and the pursuer takes this to be\nan honest, hard-to-fake signal and ignores the stotter. This is the free-\nfloating rationale, and it need not be appreciated by either gazelle or\npredator. That is, the gazelle may be entirely oblivious to why it is a good\nidea to stot if it can, and the predator, say, a lion, may not understand why\nit finds stotting gazelles relatively unattractive prey, but if the signaling\nwasn’t honest, costly signaling, it couldn’t persist in the evolutionary\narms race between predator and prey.

For instance, speciation,\nthe process in which a new species is generated by wandering away from\nits parent species, is an exceedingly rare event, but each of the millions of\nspecies that have existed on this planet got its start with an event of\nspeciation. Every birth in every lineage is a potential speciation event,\nbut speciation almost never happens, not once in a million births.\nMutation in DNA almost never happens—not once in a trillion copyings\n—but evolution depends on it. Moreover, the vast majority of mutations\nare either deleterious or neutral; a fortuitously “good” mutation almost\nnever happens. But evolution depends on those almost rarest of rare\nevents.\nConsider an intuition pump about a remarkable possibility: At this\ntime, so far as we know, there is just one species of hominid on the\nplanet, Homo sapiens. But suppose that fifty years from now, all but a\nlucky handful of our descendants are wiped out by a virus that leaves only\ntwo groups of survivors: a thousand Inuit living on remote Cornwallis\nIsland off Greenland, and a thousand Andamanese living in splendid\nisolation on islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean. These two\npopulations have been isolated from each other for thousands of years\nand have developed distinct physiological differences in response to their\nvery different environments, but we have no good reason to question the\nstandard assumption that they are members of our species. Suppose these\npopulations remain both geographically and reproductively isolated for\nanother ten thousand years, eventually repopulating the globe with two\nspecies—as they learn when they finally encounter each other and\ndiscover they have no interest in mating with each other, and besides,\ntheir few inadvertent attempts at mating are fruitless, a standard mark of\nallopatric speciation, reproductive isolation produced over time by\ngeographical isolation.

This permits us to become interested in, and reason rigorously\nabout, even more distant and locally invisible relationships than the\nformal relationship of marriage. Speciation, like marriage, is a concept\nanchored within a tight, formally definable system of thought, but unlike\nmarriage it has no conventional saliencies—weddings, rings, certificates\n—by which it can be observed.

Deducing where and\nwhen is a far trickier task than deducing that there was a Mitochondrial\nEve, something no biologist doubts. Consider a few of the things we\nalready know about Mitochondrial Eve, setting aside the controversies.\nWe know that she had at least two daughters who had surviving\ndaughters. (If she had just one daughter, her daughter would wear the\ncrown of Mitochondrial Eve.) To distinguish her title from her proper\nname, let’s call her Amy. Amy bears the title of Mitochondrial Eve; that\nis, she just happens to have been the maternal founder of today’s line of\npeople.

The survivors, fortunate to have\nsome innate resistance to the disease virus, would probably be quite\nclosely related.

She may have been the source of the mutation\nthat centuries later became a species-saver, but it probably didn’t do her\nany good, since the virus against which it triumphs probably didn’t exist\nin its virulent form then.

But not everybody appreciates how cycles—at every\nspatial and temporal scale from the atomic to the astronomic—are quite\nliterally the hidden spinning motors that power all the wonderful\nphenomena of nature. Nikolaus Otto built and sold the first internal-\ncombustion gasoline engine in 1861, and Rudolf Diesel built his engine in\n1897, two brilliant inventions that changed the world. Each exploits a\ncycle, the four-stroke Otto cycle and the two-stroke Diesel cycle, that\naccomplishes some work and then restores the system to the original\nposition so that it is ready to accomplish more work. The details of these\ncycles are ingenious, and they have been discovered and optimized by an\nR & D cycle of invention that is several centuries old. An even more\nelegant, microminiaturized engine is the Krebs cycle, which was\ndiscovered in 1937 by Hans Krebs, but invented over millions of years of\nevolution at the dawn of life. It is the eight-stroke chemical reaction that\nturns fuel—food—into energy in the process of metabolism that is\nessential to all life, from bacteria to redwood trees.\nBiochemical cycles like the Krebs cycle are responsible for all the\nmotion, growth, self-repair, and reproduction in the living world, wheels\nwithin wheels within wheels, a clockwork with trillions of moving parts,\nand each clock needing to be rewound, restored to step one so that it can\ndo its duty again. All of these cycles have been optimized by the grand\nDarwinian cycle of reproduction, generation after generation, picking up\nfortuitous improvements over the eons.\nAt a completely different scale, our ancestors discovered the efficacy of\ncycles in one of the great advances of human prehistory: the role of\nrepetition in manufacture.

Lettvin and colleagues\n(1959). It showed that the frog’s visual system is sensitive to small\nmoving dark spots on the retina, tiny shadows cast in almost all natural\ncircumstances by flies flying in the vicinity. This “fly-detector”\nmechanism is appropriately wired to the hair trigger in the frog’s tongue,\nwhich handily explains how frogs feed themselves in a cruel world and\nthereby help propagate their kind. Now what does the frog’s eye tell the\nfrog’s brain? That there is a fly out there, or that there is a fly-or-a-“slug”\n(a fake fly of one sort or another), or a thing of kind K (whatever kind of\nthing reliably triggers this visual gadget—recall the two-bitser)?\nDarwinian meaning theorists (such as Ruth Millikan, David Israel, and I)\nhave discussed this very case, and the arch-critic of evolutionary theory,\nJerry Fodor, has pounced on it to show what is wrong, by his lights, with\nany evolutionary account of such meanings: They are too indeterminate.\nThey fail to distinguish, as they ought, between such frog-eye reports as\n“fly here now” and “fly or small dark projectile here now” and so forth.\nBut this is false. We can use the frog’s environment of selection (to the\nextent that we can determine what it has been) to distinguish between the\nvarious candidates. To do this, we use exactly the same considerations we\nused to settle the questions about the meaning of the state in the two-\nbitser. And to the extent that there is nothing in the selective environment\nthat uniquely singles out a particular class of occasions, there is also no\nfact of the matter about what the frog’s-eye-report really means. This can\nbe brought home vividly by sending the frog to Panama—or more\nprecisely, sending the frog to a novel selective environment.\nSuppose scientists gather up a small population of frogs from some fly-\ngrabbing species on the brink of extinction, and put them under protective\ncustody in a new environment—a special frog zoo in which there are no\nflies, but rather zookeepers who periodically arrange to launch little food\n",

To the keepers’ delight, the system\nworks; the frogs thrive by zapping their tongues for these pellets, and\nafter a while there is a crowd of descendant frogs who have never seen a\nfly, only pellets. What do their eyes tell their brains? If you insist on\nsaying the meaning hasn’t changed, you are in a bind. The case of the\nfrogs is simply an artificially clear instance of what happens in natural\nselection all the time: exaptation—the reuse of an existing structure for a\nnew function. As Darwin was careful to remind us, the reuse of\nmachinery for new purposes is one of the secrets of Mother Nature’s\nsuccess. We can drive home the point, to anyone who wishes some\nfurther persuasion, by supposing that not all the captive frogs do equally\nwell. Variation in pellet-detecting prowess in their visual systems causes\nsome to eat less heartily than others, and then to leave less progeny as a\nresult. In short order there will have been undeniable selection for pellet\ndetection—though it would be a mistake to ask exactly when enough of\nthis has occurred for it to “count.” Don’t listen for a bell to ring\nindicating that what the frog’s eye is saying has just now been revised.\nThere was no Prime Mammal and there is no Prime Pellet Detection.\nUnless there were “meaningless” or “indeterminate” variation in the\ntriggering conditions of the various frogs’ eyes, there could be no raw\nmaterial (blind variation) for selection for a new purpose to act upon. The\nindeterminacy that Fodor (and others) see as a flaw in Darwinian\naccounts of the evolution of meaning is actually a precondition for any\nsuch evolution. The idea that there must be something determinate that\nthe frog’s eye really means—some possibly unknowable proposition in\nfroggish that expresses exactly what the frog’s eye is telling the frog’s\nbrain—is just essentialism applied to meaning (or function). Meaning,\nlike function, on which it so directly depends, is not something\ndeterminate at its birth. It arises not by saltation—huge leaps in Design\nSpace—or special creation, but by a (typically gradual) shift of\ncircumstances.\n",

LEAPING THROUGH SPACE IN THE LIBRARY OF BABEL\n \nIn 1988, Otto Neugebauer, the great historian of astronomy, was sent a\nphotograph of a fragment of Greek papyrus that had a few numbers\nwritten in a column on it. The sender, a classicist, had no clue about the\nmeaning of this bit of papyrus and wondered if Neugebauer had any\nideas. The eighty-nine-year-old scholar recomputed the line-to-line\ndifferences of the numbers, found their maximum and minimum limits,\nand determined that this papyrus had to be a translation of part of\n“Column G” of a Babylonian cuneiform tablet on which was written a\nBabylonian “System B” lunar ephemeris! (An ephemeris is a tabular\nsystem for computing the location of a heavenly body for every time in a\nparticular period.) How could Neugebauer make this Sherlock Holmesian\ndeduction? Elementary: he recognized that what was written in Greek (a\nsequence of sexagesimal—not decimal—numbers) was part—column G!\n—of a highly accurate calculation of the moon’s location that had been\nworked out by the Babylonians. There are lots of different ways of\ncalculating an ephemeris, and Neugebauer knew that anyone working out\ntheir own ephemeris independently, using their own system, would not\nhave come up with exactly the same numbers, though they might have\nbeen close. The Babylonian system B was excellent, so the design had\nbeen gratefully conserved, in translation, with all its fine-grained\nparticularities (Neugebauer, 1989).\nNeugebauer was a great scholar, but you can probably execute a parallel\nfeat of deduction, following in his footsteps.

I haven’t said whether Spakesheare is a robot, constructed out of\nmetal and silicon chips, or, like the original Frankenstein’s monster,\nconstructed out of human tissues—or nano-engineered out of cells, or\nproteins, or amino acids, or carbon atoms.

The program automatically selected\nthe assemblages that moved the farthest on their trials for virtual mating,\nand then repeated the cycle with the resulting offspring. Better and better\nswimmers, walkers, and jumpers evolved, untouched by any intelligent\ndesigner’s hand. The far-from-random designs that resulted demonstrated\nhow efficiently (virtual) evolution could sorta discover good design\nprinciples and sorta reinvent a striking variety of features found in\nnature.\nIt is a spectacular example of getting a lot from a relatively simple\nmodel, but it also shows the narrow limits of virtual world evolution.\nSims designed the simple “developmental” system that takes whole\ngenomes as inputs and yields novel organisms as outputs, but that process\nis all backstage, not part of the virtual world being simulated. As a result\nan accidental bump or shock or collision with a bit of (virtual) debris\ncannot shorten or lengthen a genome, or change the rules of gene\nexpression. All of that machinery is simply not in the virtual world with\nits virtual stuff, and hence is immutable. There is no way, for instance,\nfor a Sims creature to evolve a new chromosome. Its whole genetic\nsystem is outside the model, not facing natural selection itself but merely\nconveying genetic information by fiat between generations. (For another\nexample of this phenomenon, see chapter 51.)\nIn a computer model of creativity there should be junk lying around\nthat your creative processes can bump into, noises that your creative\nprocesses can’t help overhearing. The spontaneous intrusion of that little\nnoise from the next room may tweak what those processes are doing in a\nway that is serendipitous, or in a way that is destructive, but either way\nthis opens up new possibilities. The exploitation of accidents is the key to\ncreativity, whether what is being made is a new genome, a new behavior,\nor a new melody.\n",

    "chunk_full": "Let me clarify what I’m not saying. The problem with Sims’s evolved\ncreatures is not that they are not made of carbon, or that they contain no\nprotein or hemoglobin. The problem is that they are virtual. And by being\nvirtual, they live in a world many orders of magnitude simpler than the\nworld of biological evolution. The same thing is true of Cope’s EMI.\nWonderful as it is, EMI is orders of magnitude simpler than the world of\nhuman musical composition. What’s delightful about both cases is the\ndiscovery of just how much you can get from something so clean, so\nnoise-free, so abstract.\nWe can imagine improving Cope’s EMI, or Sims’s work, or any other\nsuch project in artificial life or artificial creativity, by adding more and\nmore and more junk, more and more opportunities for collisions, into the\nworld. This would provide more virtual stuff for their sims to cope with,\nand you never can tell when serendipity will strike, if given an\nopportunity. But consider how counterintuitive such advice would appear:\nNo matter what you’re modeling, make sure that every phenomenon,\nevery subroutine, everything that happens in that world broadcasts a\nvariety of nonfunctional effects through the world: makes\nextraneous noises, leaves a wake, sheds dust, causes vibrations, and\nso forth.\nWhy? What is all this noise for? It’s not for anything; it’s just there so\nthat every other process has that noise as a potential source of signal, as\nsomething that it might turn, by the alchemy of the creative algorithm,\ninto function, into art, into meaning. Every increment of design in the\nuniverse begins with a moment of serendipity, the undesigned\nintersection of two trajectories yielding something that turns out,\nretrospectively, to be more than a mere collision. But to the extent that\ncomputer modelers follow this advice, they squander the efficiency that\nmakes computers such great tools. So there is a sort of homeostasis here.\nWe can see that, not for any mysterious reason, computer modeling of\ncreativity confronts diminishing returns.

That would be\napproximately the same mistake as thinking that Hamlet is made out of\nink. Of course any actual copy of Shakespeare’s play has to be made out\nof something (if not ink, then maybe letter-shaped patterns on a computer\nscreen, or even strings of binary code burned into a CD), but the play is\nan abstract, informational thing that can hop from medium to medium.\nGenes, as recipes for making proteins, are also abstract, informational\nthings, according to this way of thinking—which has always struck me as\nthe right way. But there have been those who disagree, who doubt the\nvalue of conceiving of genes in this way. For them, and in particular for\nphilosopher of biology Peter Godfrey-Smith, I constructed a little\nintuition pump:\nHerb and Alice want to have a baby, but here’s how they do it:\n \n1. They both have their genomes sequenced. They receive in the mail a\ndata file consisting of their genomes, spelled out in two sequences of\napproximately three billion letters, A, C, G, T, . . . .\n2. Then they write a little computer program that does the meiosis\nalgorithm on both their genomes, (randomly) creating virtual sperm\nand eggs, which are then (randomly) united in silico, to create a new\ngenome specification (which passes all the forensic tests for being the\nspecification of the DNA of an offspring of Herb and Alice). (So far\nthis is all done literally in terms of the symbols A, C, G, T, a purely\ncomputational process of string-rewriting.)\n3. This specification is then used to construct, codon by codon, an actual\nDNA implementation of the entire genome, A = adenine, C = cytosine,\nG = guanine, and T = thymine. (Craig Venter’s lab can now do this.)\n4. This genome is then implanted in the nucleus of a human egg (does it\nmatter whose egg this is, since its own DNA will be removed before\n",

It seems\nto me to be quite obvious that Hal is indeed their biological\noffspring, since it avails itself of all the genetic information they\nwould contribute if Hal were conceived in the normal way. This\nintuition pump highlights the importance of what matters in\nreproduction: information, and the causal transmission of\ninformation (in this case, in the form of ASCII code for “A,” “C,”\n“G,” and “T,” not in the form of molecules). The causal link might,\nfor instance, pass through telecommunication satellites, instead of\ntaking the more direct, biochemical routes. [Drawn with revisions\nfrom personal correspondence, April 26, 2010]\nGodfrey-Smith agreed with me that Hal is the offspring of Herb and\nAlice, but he had some reservations about my way of putting it (which\ncan be read, unabridged, in Dennett, 2010; Godfrey-Smith, 2011). In the\nsame spirit of constructive criticism, I acknowledged that there is a\nbiologically important difference between the process Herb and Alice\nused to procreate and the way we normally do. What if everybody did it\nHerb and Alice’s way? Since the genetic information from Herb does not\nride in its usual vehicle—a sperm cell—on its route to the egg, sperm\nmotility would no longer be under selection pressure, and would, other\nthings being equal, decline over the generations. Use it or lose it. Still, I\nmaintain—and think this intuition pump illustrates clearly—that the\nmolecular structure that stays roughly constant over the generations is\npreserved because it embodies the information that it does.\nIf there were alternate structures that preserved the information,\nevolution would continue unimpeded. This claim can be further examined\nin yet another intuition pump. Imagine that on another planet, “odd-\nnumbered” generations used the DNA rungs A, C, G, and T, and “even-\nnumbered” generations used a different double helix, call it XNA, with\nrungs made of P, Q, R, and S (some other molecules).

The concept of memes is one of my\nfavorite thinking tools, and I have a lot to say about it—too much to put\nin this book! I have already said a great deal about memes elsewhere\n(Dennett, 1990, 1991a, 1995a, to cite a few examples). For various\nreasons many people have a visceral dislike of the concept, so they tend\nto fall for the many criticisms that have been raised. I have decided that I\nshould try one more time to make the case for memes and deal with all\nthe critics, both the serious critics and the white-knuckled meme-haters,\nbut that will take a small book of its own.

There may be others. If there are,\nprovided certain other conditions are met, they will almost\ninevitably tend to become the basis for an evolutionary process.\nBut do we have to go to distant worlds to find other kinds of\nreplication and other, consequent, kinds of evolution? I think that a\nnew kind of replicator has recently emerged on this very planet. It is\nstaring us in the face. It is still in its infancy, still drifting clumsily\nabout in its primeval soup, but already it is achieving evolutionary\nchange at a rate which leaves the old gene panting far behind. [p.\n206]\n",

    "chunk_full": "Two main insights that flow from this thinking tool dramatically alter\nthe landscape of our imaginations when we think about human culture\nand creativity. First, memes shatter the otherwise seductive idea that\nthere are only two routes to good Design: it’s either genes or genius. For\nmost thinkers, until memes open their eyes, if something in human life\nexhibits the telltale signs of adaptation of means to ends or functional\nefficiency, it must be either a product of genetic natural selection or a\nproduct of deliberate, comprehending, intending human thinking\n—intelligent design. Orgel’s Second Law—evolution is cleverer than you\nare—might seem to enshrine the two options, but in fact there is a third\npossibility, and it is everywhere instanced: nongenetic, cultural selection,\naccomplished by the same process of mindless natural selection that\ngives us the genes. A vivid example is provided by an observation about\nPolynesian canoes more than a century old: “every boat is copied from\nanother boat. . . . it is the sea herself who fashions the boats, choosing\nthose which function and destroying the others” (Alain, 1908). This is\nnatural selection, plain as day: the islanders have a simple rule: if it\nreturns from the sea intact, copy it! They may have considerable\ncomprehension of the principles of naval architecture that retrospectively\nendorse their favorite designs, but it is strictly unnecessary. Evolution\ntakes care of the quality control. The same is true of grammatical rules,\nwords, religious practices, and many other bedrock features of human\nculture: nobody designed them, and they’re not “in our genes,” but they\nare nevertheless quite excellently designed.\nThe second insight is that the price we pay for having this extra\ninformation highway, this bounteous medium of design and transmission\nthat no other species enjoys, is that memes have their own fitness, just\nlike all the other symbionts that thrive in our company, and their fitness\nis to some degree independent of our own fitness. Blindness to this idea is\nendemic, and is particularly evident when people discuss evolutionary\naccounts of religion. “Oh, so you’re working on an evolutionary theory of\nreligion. What good do you think religions provide? They must be good\nfor something, since apparently every human culture has religion in some\nform or other.” Well, every human culture has the common cold too.\n",

TWO COUNTER-IMAGES\n \nMany of the tools I have introduced earlier deal in one way or another\nwith the mind—believing, thinking, and so forth—but I postponed the\nknotty problems of consciousness until now. There is a reason: when\npeople start musing about consciousness, they have a way of inflating\ntheir notions of what consciousness must be, of bamboozling themselves.\nThey tackle the hardest issues before they have had a chance to see how\nmuch of the work (and play) of the mind can be accounted for without\nfirst settling the perennial questions about conscious experience. Now\nthat we have built a base camp, are we ready to tackle the summit? Yes,\nbut if we think of it that way, we are already making a mistake of\nimagination! Our minds don’t have a single magnificent summit,\nconsciousness. Contrary to a tradition going back at least to Descartes in\nthe seventeenth century, conscious phenomena are neither the most\n“central” nor the “highest” phenomena in our minds (Jackendoff, 1987;\nDennett, 1991a). A seductive bad image needs a counter-image to\nneutralize it, so here is a simple imagination-adjuster to start us off:\nrecall Cole Porter’s wonderful song “You’re the Top” and reflect that\nmaybe you’re not the top—not the summit of the mountain, but the whole\nmountain, and what you know and can tell about the mountain that is you\nis not the view from the summit, but various views from halfway up. You\nmight like to think of the phenomena of consciousness as rather like the\nfringe of hair around a bald man’s pate. Bear that in mind.\nAnd here is another: consciousness is not a medium, like television,\ninto which information can get transduced or recorded, and there is no\nplace in the brain where “it all comes together” for the appreciation of\nsome Central Witness—I call this imaginary place the Cartesian Theater\n(Dennett, 1991a). Consciousness is more like fame than television: fame\nin the brain, cerebral celebrity, a way in which some contents come to be\nmore influential and memorable than the competition. Instead of arguing\nfor this (for the arguments, see Dennett, 1991a, 2005b), I am simply\noffering you this thinking tool, take it or leave it, with some friendly\n",

There is something about our living, breathing,\norganic bodies and brains that is necessary for consciousness. This is an\nintuition that hardly needs pumping, so ubiquitous is it, and maybe these\npeople are right. But now that we have some insight into the way our\nbodies and brains can themselves be seen as made of robots made of\nrobots made of robots, and so on, all the way down to below the neuron\nlevel where the motor proteins and other nanobots trudge along making\nthe whole system work, we can see that maybe that hunch is just an\nartifact of impoverished imagination: folks have been thinking about\nrobots that are too simple, by many orders of magnitude. A friend once\nresponded to this opening gambit of mine by trying to nip it in the bud: “I\njust can’t conceive of a conscious robot!” Nonsense, I replied. What you\nmean is that you won’t conceive of a conscious robot. You think it is silly\nand preposterous to try to take the idea seriously.

It is\nlogically possible that there aren’t really any carbon atoms; what appear\nto scientists to be carbon atoms are actually kazillions of tiny spaceships\npiloted by aliens whose life work is to pretend that they are carbon atoms.\nIt is logically possible that the entire universe was created about six\nthousand years ago, with all the so-called fossils in place and photons\nstreaming in as if from galaxies light-years away.

Is there anything that makes the Zombic\nHunch more substantial, more worthy of consideration? Many serious\nthinkers have thought so.\nPerhaps the grandfather of all intuition pumps designed to yield\nsomething like the Zombic Hunch was invented hundreds of years ago by\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the philosopher/mathematician who shares\ncredit with Isaac Newton for inventing calculus. He was as smart and\ningenious as any thinker in his age, and yet he fell for this intuition pump\nof his own devising.\nAnd supposing there were a machine, so constructed as to think, feel,\nand have perception, it might be conceived as increased in size,\nwhile keeping the same proportions, so that one might go into it as\ninto a mill. That being so, we should, on examining its interior, find\nonly parts which work one upon another, and never anything by\nwhich to explain a perception.

Recall William\nBateson, the early-twentieth-century geneticist who couldn’t imagine that\ngenes could be material entities (see p. 100). Just as Bateson had no way\nof taking seriously the extravagant idea of three-billion base-pairs in a\ndouble helix inside every cell (preposterous!), Leibniz had no way of\ntaking seriously the idea of a “mill” with trillions of moving parts. He\nwould insist, no doubt, that “just adding more parts” couldn’t take you\nfrom machinery to mind, but that would be only his hunch, not anything\nhe could claim to demonstrate. But if Darwin, Crick, and Watson have\nexposed Bateson’s failure of imagination, Turing has rendered Leibniz’s\nintuition pump obsolete. Except that he hasn’t. Not yet. In due course, I\nthink, the Zombic Hunch will fade into history, a curious relic of our\nspirit-haunted past, but I doubt that it will ever go extinct. It will not\nsurvive in its current, mind-besotting form, but it will survive as a less\nvirulent mutation, still psychologically powerful but stripped of\nauthority. We’ve seen this happen before. It still seems as if the earth\nstands still and the sun and moon go around it, but we have learned that it\nis wise to disregard this as mere appearance. It still seems as if there’s a\ndifference between a thing at absolute rest and a thing that is merely not\naccelerating within an inertial frame, but we have learned not to trust this\nfeeling. I anticipate a day when philosophers and scientists and laypeople\nwill chuckle over the fossil traces of our earlier bafflement about\nconsciousness: “It still seems as if these mechanistic theories of\nconsciousness leave something out, but of course we now understand that\nthat’s an illusion. They do, in fact, explain everything about\nconsciousness that needs explanation.”\nContinuing allegiance to the Zombic Hunch is actually fostered by\nmany philosophers’ thought experiments, such as John Searle’s famous\nChinese Room, the inspiration for my coinage, “intuition pump.” It will\nsoon get dismantled in front of your eyes.

Can you\nconceive of more than three dimensions? The curvature of space?\nQuantum entanglement? Just imagining something is not enough—and in\nfact, Descartes tells us, it is not conceiving at all. According to Descartes,\nimagining uses your (ultimately mechanistic) body, with all its\nlimitations (nearsightedness, limited resolution, angle, and depth);\nconceiving uses just your mind, which is a much more powerful organ of\ndiscernment, unfettered by the requirements of mechanism. He offers a\ncompelling example of the difference: the chiliagon, a regular thousand-\nsided polygon. Can you conceive of one? Can you imagine one? What is\nthe difference? Let’s try imagining one first. Start with a pentagon, say,\nthen imagine a decagon. It’s hard, but you know what to do: bend each\nside of the pentagon in the middle and push out a little bit, turning five\nequal sides into ten. How far should you push out? Just inscribe the\npentagon inside a circle and push the new sides out till they intersect the\ncircle. Now do it again, making an icosagon, with twenty sides.\n \nDo it again, and again seven more times, and you’ll have a regular 1,280-\nsided polygon, which is well-nigh indistinguishable from a circle in\nimagination, but is as distinct in conception from a circle—and from a\nchiliagon—as a square is distinct from a circle.

Further self-monitoring allows a zimbo to have and use\ninformation about those very self-monitoring states, and so on,\nindefinitely. A zimbo, in other words, is equipped with recursive self-\nrepresentation—unconscious recursive self-representation, if that makes\nany sense. It is only in virtue of this special talent that a zimbo can\nparticipate in the following sort of conversation:\nYOU: Zeke, do you like me?\nZEKE: Of course I do.

It can\n“think” (in its unconscious zombie way) about how it feels about how it\nfelt about what it was thinking of when it wondered whether . . . , and so\nforth. It is easy enough to imagine your dreadful suspicions being aroused\nif Zeke just draws a blank, becoming weirdly unresponsive when you\nquery him this way, but that would be discovering that if Zeke is a\nzombie, he isn’t a zimbo.

VIM: HOW MUCH IS THAT IN “REAL MONEY”?\n \nIt is a common opinion that although you could construct a robotic model\nof color vision, say, that exhibited all the familiar phenomena we humans\nexperience, such as complementary afterimages and color contrast\nillusions, and although the robot would have similar internal processes\nthat accounted for its afterimages and so forth, since “it’s just a robot” it\ncouldn’t have red and blue qualia. The functional states that signaled or\nrepresented colored things in front of the robot’s television camera eyes\nwould not have that extra something that we have. Thomas Nagel’s\nfamous essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” (1974) provides us with a\nstandard way of alluding to the conscious states, if any, of an entity. It\nwouldn’t be like anything to be a robot having an afterimage. Why do so\nmany people think this is obvious? It might be because they are\nimagining a relatively simple robot and failing to note that you can’t\ndraw conclusions about all robots from facts about all simple robots. Of\ncourse if you define qualia as intrinsic properties of experiences\nconsidered in isolation from all their causes and effects, and logically\nindependent of all dispositional properties, then qualia are logically\nguaranteed to elude all functional analysis. No amount of clever\nengineering could endow a robot with qualia—but this is an empty\nvictory, since there is no reason to believe such intrinsic properties exist.\nTo see this, compare the qualia of experience to the value of money.\nSome naïve Americans seem to think that dollars, unlike euros and yen,\nhave intrinsic value. The tourist in the cartoon asks, “How much is that in\nreal money?” meaning how much is that in dollars. Let’s push this idea a\nlittle farther: These naïve Americans are willing to exchange dollars for\neuros; they are happy to “reduce” the value of other currencies to their\nexchange rate with dollars (or goods and services), but when they do this,\nthey have a sense that dollars are different. Every dollar, they declare, has\nsomething logically independent of the functional exchange powers it\nshares with all other currencies in circulation. A dollar has a certain je ne\nsais quoi.

Pounds sterling and euros and the like have no intrinsic value—\nthey are just symbolic stand-ins; they are redeemable for dollars, and\nhence have derived economic value, but they don’t have vim! How sad\nfor those Europeans! Their currencies lack intrinsic economic value! How\ndo they bear it? How do they motivate themselves to earn their pay, these\npoor vimbies!

One evening, over a fine bottle of Chambertin, the\nphilosopher Wilfrid Sellars said to me, “Dan, qualia are what make life\nworth living!” That’s an attractive idea. Let’s consider what it would\nimply about qualia. To see what is at issue, I will present an intuition\npump against a background of recent work in cognitive neuroscience on\nseveral bizarre and counterintuitive pathologies: prosopagnosia and\nCapgras delusion.\nProsopagnosics have normal vision in most regards, but they cannot\nrecognize faces. They can tell a male from a female, old from young,\nAfrican from Asian, but faced with several close friends of the same\ngender and age, they are unable to tell which is which until they hear a\nvoice or detect some other identifying peculiarity. Given a row of\nphotographs of people, including famous politicians and movie stars,\nfamily members, and anonymous strangers, a prosopagnosic asked to\nidentify any who are known to him will generally perform at chance.\nThose of us who are not prosopagnosics may find it difficult to imagine\nwhat it’s like to look right at one’s mother, say, and be unable to\nrecognize her. Some may find it hard to believe that prosopagnosia exists.\nWhen I tell people about these phenomena, I often discover skeptics who\nare quite confident that I am making these facts up. But we must learn to\ntreat such difficulties as measures of our frail powers of imagination, not\ninsights into impossibility. Prosopagnosia (from the Greek prosopon,\nwhich means “face,” and agnosia, “not knowing”) is a well-studied,\nuncontroversial pathology afflicting thousands of people.\nOne of the most interesting facts about (many) prosopagnosics is that in\nspite of their inability to identify or recognize faces as a conscious task,\nthey can respond differently to familiar and unfamiliar faces, and even\nrespond in ways indicating that unbeknownst to themselves, or covertly,\nthey were able to identify the faces they were unable to identify when\nasked.

You should be able to execute\nthis task swiftly, but if each name were shown with the wrong picture of\nthe person, your response would be markedly delayed. This could be\nexplained only if at some level, you were actually identifying the faces,\neven though it was strictly irrelevant to the task. It seems, then, that there\nare (at least) two largely independent visual face-recognition systems in\nthe brain: the impaired conscious system, which cannot help the subjects\nin the task presented by the experiment, and the unimpaired unconscious\nsystem, which responds with agitation to the mismatched names and\nfaces.

The absence of that subtle contribution to identification is so\nupsetting (“Something’s missing!”) that it amounts to a pocket veto on\nthe positive vote of the surviving system’s identification of the familiar\nperson: the emergent result is the sufferer’s heartfelt conviction that he or\nshe is looking at an impostor. Instead of blaming the mismatch on their\nown faulty perceptual system, Capgras sufferers blame the world, in a\nway that is so metaphysically extravagant, so improbable, that there can\nbe little doubt of the power (the political power, in effect) that the\nimpaired unconscious face-recognition system normally has in us all.\nWhen this particular system’s epistemic hunger goes unsatisfied, it\nthrows such a fit that it overthrows the contributions of the other systems.\nHaydn Ellis and Young first proposed this hypothesis in 1990, and since\nthen Young and neuroscientist Chris Frith and others have confirmed and\nelaborated it.

I don’t\nknow if I want to go on living in this world!” Clapgras closes his eyes and\nrubs them; he cautiously opens them again, only to be confronted yet\nagain by a strangely disgusting world, familiar but also different in some\nway that defies description.

Remember that Dr. Chromaphil had to propose this hypothesis\nto his skeptical colleagues, and Clapgras may well share their skepticism.\nAfter all, he not only hasn’t complained of any problem with his color\nqualia (as in the standard stories), but also has satisfied himself that his\ncolor vision is just fine in the same way he satisfied the researchers: by\neasily passing the standard color vision tests. This feature of the story\nought to cause some discomfort, for it is commonly assumed in the\nphilosophical literature that such behavioral self-testing is irrelevant:\nsurely (ding!) those tests have no bearing at all on qualia. Those tests are\nstandardly characterized as having no power at all to illuminate or\nconstrain qualia quandaries.

Consider the effect of monosodium glutamate (MSG), the\nflavor enhancer. There is no doubt that it makes food seem tastier, more\nstrongly flavored, but does it change the qualia of food, or does it merely\nheighten the sensitivity of people to the qualia they were already\nenjoying? This is an appeal for a clarification of the concept of qualia,\nnot an empirical question about the site of action of MSG, or the\nvariation in human responses to MSG as shown by subjects’ reports,\nsince until we settle the conceptual question one way or another, any\ndiscoveries \nabout \nthe \nunderlying \nneural \nprocesses \nor\nheterophenomenology of the subject would be systematically\nambiguous.

The\nscience journalist Robert Wright (2000) expresses the attitude succinctly:\nOf course the problem here is with the claim that consciousness is\n“identical” to physical brain states.

Thinking machines were just around the corner! Berkeley\nphilosopher John Searle was sure he could see through this, and\nconcocted a thought experiment to prove it. In 1980, he published\n“Minds, Brains and Programs,” his famous Chinese Room thought\nexperiment purporting to show that “Strong AI” was impossible. He\ndefined Strong AI as the claim that “the appropriately programmed\ncomputer literally has cognitive states and that the programs thereby\nexplain human cognition” (Searle, 1980, p. 417), and later clarified his\ndefinition: “the appropriately programmed digital computer with the\nright inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense\nthat human beings have minds” (Searle, 1988, p. 136). The 1980 article\nappeared in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, the flagship journal of\ncognitive science, and BBS, as it is known, has a special format: each\nissue contains several long “target articles” accompanied by several-\ndozen commentaries by experts in the field and a response by the\nauthor(s). Since BBS is energetically interdisciplinary, these experts\ntypically come from a variety of disciplines, giving the reader a useful\nand timely cross section of reactions. Seeing how—and whether—these\nother experts take the target article seriously is a great way of gauging\nhow to use or ignore it in your own work. You also can learn a lot about\nthe difficulties of interdisciplinary communication, with very confident\npeople furiously talking past each other, or participating in academic tag\nteam wrestling of the highest caliber. Searle’s target article provoked a\nfire storm of rebuttal, including mine (Dennett, 1980), in which I coined\nthe term “intuition pump,” in the service of trying to show what was\ndeeply misleading about his thought experiment.\nIt was my term, but credit should also be given to Doug Hofstadter, for\nmy coinage grew out of discussions with him about Searle’s essay, which\nwe reprinted, with commentary, in our anthology, The Mind’s I\n",

Passing the Turing test would be, in the eyes of\nmany in the field, the vindication of Strong AI. Why?

We know he gets\nhis “set of rules” (instructions) in English, but are they along the lines of\n“add the contents of register 39021192 to the contents of register\n215845085” (machine code), or “Define a constant: queue-size and set it\nat 100” (source code)? Is he down in the basement, doing arithmetic at a\nfurious rate (trillions of operations per second), or is he following the\nsource code of a program, implemented many layers higher? And if he’s\nfollowing the source code, does he get to read any comments? Better not,\nsince they are not officially part of the program, and they would give him\nlots of hints about what was going on (“This parses the sentence, yielding\nnouns, pronouns, verbs, and modifiers, and identifies it as a question,\ndeclarative, imperative or interjection,” and then, a few billion operations\nlater, “pun discovered; switch to repartee mode . . . ,” and then a more\ndetailed set of billions of operations, in which references are refined,\nalternative answers are evaluated rather like different chess moves, and\nthen finally an output sentence is generated). If the program Searle is\nhand-simulating is able to carry on an impressive conversation in\nChinese, it will have to consult huge data banks not just of “sets of\nChinese symbols,” as he puts it, but of everyday knowledge that Chinese\nspeakers share, and that is the least of it. When Searle hand-simulates,\ndoes he get any hints of all this layered cognitive activity, or is it just a\nwhole lot of arithmetic to him?\nThink of how Searle would handle the following question in English:\n",

His commentary on Searle in our book featured this criticism, and led to a\nferocious response from Searle (1982) in the pages of the New York Review of Books, because,\nalthough we had reprinted his article correctly, in his commentary Doug slipped and wrote “a\nfew slips” where Searle had said “bits,” and this, Searle claimed, completely misrepresented his\nargument! If Searle is right about this, if that small inadvertent mutation transformed the\nmachinery, this actually proved our point, in a way: if such a tiny adjustment disables or enables\na thought experiment, that is something that should be drawn to the attention of all whose\nintuitions are up for pumping.\n2 Check out Hofstadter’s own virtuoso demonstration in The Mind’s I (Hofstadter and Dennett,\n1981), showing that the Chinese Room is an intuition pump with (at least) five knobs, which he\nproceeds to turn, one at a time, to derive a family of different thought experiments with different\ninvited conclusions. In the closing reflections, I noted,\nEach setting of the dials on our intuition pump yields a slightly different narrative, with\ndifferent problems receding into the background and different morals drawn. Which\nversion or versions should be trusted is a matter to settle by examining them carefully, to\nsee which features of the narrative are doing the work. If the oversimplifications are the\nsource of the intuitions, rather than just devices for suppressing irrelevant complications,\nwe should mistrust the conclusions we are invited to draw. [p. 460]\n3 As has often been pointed out, this conviction echoes that of Descartes, who proposed in his\nDiscourse on Method way back in 1637 that the best way to tell a machine from a person with\nan immaterial soul was to have a conversation with it.\nIt is indeed conceivable that a machine could be so made that it would utter words, and\neven words appropriate to the presence of physical acts or objects which cause some\nchange in its organs; as, for example, if it was touched in some spot that it would ask\nwhat you wanted to say to it; if in another, that it would cry that it was hurt, and so on for\nsimilar things. But it could never modify its phrases to reply to the sense of whatever was\nsaid in its presence, as even the most stupid men can do.\nNobody knows if Turing got the inspiration for his intuition pump from Descartes’s intuition\npump.\n4 Thanks to linguist, sinologist, and polymath David Moser for the example, which was created\nin China just as I was casting about for such an example.\n",

The idea of a mind-thingy that\ngoes to Heaven when somebody dies grows more incoherent every day.\nThe wishful thinking that prevents us from just discarding it, along with\nthe goblins and witches, is only too apparent. So those of us who are\nmaterialists, confident that the mind is the brain (properly understood),\nhave to confront the question of why it seems that each of us has some\nsuch mind-thingy, or better: that each of us is some such mind-thingy\ninhabiting a body, and more particularly a brain. Do we simply find our\nselves when we look inside?\nDavid Hume famously disparaged this idea in 1739:\nFor my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I\nalways stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or\ncold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can\ncatch myself at any time without a perception. . . .

As the old\njoke has it, I’d rather have a free bottle in front of me than a prefrontal\nlobotomy, but in either case I’d be there to experience it.) Then what\nmight the self be? I propose that it is the same kind of thing as a center of\ngravity, an abstraction that is, in spite of its abstractness, tightly coupled\nto the physical world. You, like every other material object, have a center\nof gravity (or more properly a center of mass, but we’ll ignore that nicety\nhere). If you are top-heavy, your center of gravity is higher than average\nfor people of your height, you have to work harder to stay upright, and so\nforth. There are many ways of locating your center of gravity, which,\ndepending on such factors as the shoes you have on and when you last ate\na meal, moves around in a smallish area in the middle of your body. It is\na mathematical point, not an atom or molecule. The center of gravity of a\nlength of steel pipe is not made of steel and indeed is not made of\nanything. It is a point in space, the point on the midline running through\nthe center of the pipe that is equidistant from the ends (roughly,\ndepending on imperfections, etc.).\nThe concept of a center of gravity is a very useful thinking tool in its\nown right. In effect it averages over all the gravitational attractions\nbetween every particle of matter in a thing and every particle of matter on\nthe planet, and tells us that we can boil all that down to two points—the\ncenter of the earth (its center of gravity) and the center of gravity of the\nthing—and calculate the behavior of the thing under varying conditions.\nFor instance, if a thing’s center of gravity at any time falls outside all the\npoints of its supporting base, it will topple. Of course, we had an intuitive\nunderstanding of centers of gravity long before Newton figured out\ngravity. (“Sit down! You’re rocking the boat.”) Now we can explain how\nand why the concept works in detail, and if we’re designing vehicles or\nfloor lamps, for example, the goal of lowering a center of gravity, or\nmoving it to a more effective location, shows the near indispensability of\nthe concept in many of our activities.

Sherlock Holmes, as described by Arthur Conan Doyle in the\nSherlock Holmes mystery stories, has many properties, but where Conan\nDoyle was silent, there is no fact of the matter.

HETEROPHENOMENOLOGY\n \nHeterophenomenology is not an intuition pump, but another example of\nstaging that is well worth putting in place before we tackle some difficult\nquestions. The study of human consciousness involves phenomena that at\nfirst glance seem to occur in something rather like another dimension: the\nprivate, subjective, “first-person” dimension that each of us occupies\nwith regard to our own consciousness, and to which nobody else can gain\ndirect access. What, then, is the relation between the standard “third-\nperson” objective methodologies for studying meteors or magnets (or\nhuman metabolism or bone density), and the methodologies for studying\nhuman consciousness? Do we have to create some radical or\nrevolutionary alternative science, or can the standard methods be\nextended in such a way as to do justice to the phenomena of human\nconsciousness? I defend the claim that there is a straightforward,\nconservative extension of objective science that handsomely covers all\nthe ground of human consciousness, doing justice to all the data without\never having to abandon the rules and constraints of the experimental\nmethods that have worked so well in the rest of science. This third-person\nmethodology, heterophenomenology (phenomenology of an other not\noneself), is the sound way to take the first-person point of view as\nseriously as it can legitimately be taken.\nWhy the multisyllabic name? “Phenomenology” originally meant a\ncatalogue of phenomena, of one sort or another, before there is a good\ntheory of them. In the sixteenth century, William Gilbert compiled a\ngood phenomenology of magnetism, but it was centuries before all the\nmagnetic phenomena he carefully described could be explained. In the\nearly twentieth century, Edmund Husserl, and a group of psychologists\nand philosophers influenced by him, adopted the term, “Phenomenology”\n(with a capital “P”), for a presumably scientific study of the phenomena\nof subjective experience, to be observed using a “first-person”\nintrospective method that attempted to be theory-neutral and without\npresuppositions.

But we can\nstudy consciousness objectively, and the method is really just a simple\ntwist on Phenomenology, so I call it heterophenomenology, to contrast it\nwith Husserlian autophenomenology. Heterophenomenology is the study\nof first-person phenomena from the third-person point of view of\nobjective science.\nObviously the key difference between experiments with rocks, roses,\nand rats on the one hand, and experiments with awake, cooperative\nhuman subjects on the other, is that the latter can communicate in\nlanguage and hence can collaborate with experimenters, by making\nsuggestions, interacting verbally, and telling them what it is like under\nvarious controlled conditions. That is the core of heterophenomenology:\nit exploits our capacity to perform and interpret speech acts, yielding a\ncatalogue of what the subject believes to be true about his or her\nconscious experience. This catalogue of beliefs fleshes out the subject’s\nheterophenomenological world, the world according to S, the subjective\nworld of one subject. The total set of details of heterophenomenology,\nplus all the data we can gather about concurrent events in the brains of\nsubjects and in the surrounding environment, comprise the total data set a\ntheory of human consciousness must explain. It leaves out no objective\nphenomena and no subjective phenomena of consciousness.\nThe interpretation required to turn raw data about speech sounds and\nbutton pressings into reports and expressions of beliefs involves adopting\nthe intentional stance: it requires the working hypothesis that the subject\nis an agent whose actions are rationally guided by beliefs and desires that\nare themselves rational, given the subject’s perceptual history and needs.\nFor instance, the constraints of the intentional stance can be clearly\ndiscerned in the standard precautions taken in such experiments to\nprevent subjects from having experiences that might give them either\nbeliefs or desires that would tend to bias their responses in ways that\nwould distort our interpretation of their actions: we keep them in the dark\n",

If you can’t make a\nhard problem relatively simple, you are probably not going about it the\nright way. Simplification is not just for beginners.\nBiology has its “model organisms”—species that have been carefully\nchosen to ease the path of the experimenter; they reproduce swiftly in the\nlab, are relatively safe and easy to handle, and—once they have been\nstudied by many teams—are well mapped and understood: the fruit fly,\nthe laboratory rat, the zebra fish, the squid (for its giant nerve axon), the\nnematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana, a\nhardy, fast-growing plant related to mustard, the first plant to have its\nentire genome sequenced. Artificial intelligence (AI) has its own simple\ncases, known as “toy problems,” which, as the name suggests, are\ndeliberately oversimplified versions of “serious” real-world problems.\nMany of the most interesting programs devised in AI are solutions to toy\nproblems—such as getting a computer program to build simple structures\nin the blocks world, a virtual world consisting of a tabletop with a bunch\nof movable children’s blocks on it. Playing chess is a toy problem; it is\ncertainly much more tractable than driving a car from Maine to\nCalifornia, or solving the Arab–Israeli conflict, or even making a\nsandwich of appropriate ingredients found in a kitchen.

Nobody had to design or invent the glider; it was discovered to be\nimplied by the physics of the Life world. But that, of course, is actually\ntrue of everything in the Life world. Nothing happens in the Life world\nthat isn’t strictly implied—logically deducible by straightforward\ntheorem-proving—by the physics and the initial configuration of cells.\nSome of the things in the Life world are just more marvelous and\nunanticipated (by us, with our puny intellects) than others.

ROCK, PAPER, AND SCISSORS\n \nProbably every one of you knows the game of rock, paper, and scissors.\nTwo people face each other, and count, “One, two, three, shoot!” and\neach, simultaneously, extends a hand either clenched in a fist (rock), with\na pair of fingers extended (scissors), or with the palm flat open facing\ndown (paper). Rock breaks (beats) scissors, scissors cut (beat) paper, and\npaper covers (beats) rock. Unless both players display the same hand\nsymbol—a tie—one player wins and the other loses. It’s a tantalizing\ngame because if you can outguess your opponent, you can seem to read\nher mind and come up with the right hand shape to win consistently. It’s\nunnerving when that happens. Can some people play the game better than\nothers? Apparently, since there have been tournaments with large cash\nprizes in which national and international winners have emerged, and—\nthis is important since every tournament has to be won by somebody even\nif there is no skill involved—the better players have a history of winning.\nHow do they do it? Perhaps by picking up subtle hints from the faces\nand postures of their opponents. Poker players speak of reading the “tell”\nof another player, sensing when they are bluffing and when they aren’t,\nwhile maintaining a “poker face” of their own. Perhaps most people who\nplay rock, paper, and scissors have a tell that they can’t control and that\nthe best players pick up at the last instant. So what is the best strategy to\nuse to prevent your opponent from picking up a pattern from your outer\ndemeanor? Playing absolutely randomly is the best, since if you play a\nrandom sequence of moves, there is simply no pattern for your opponent\nto detect. (While you are playing randomly, and breaking even, you can\ntry to find a pattern in your opponent’s moves, and use that pattern to\ncraft a nonrandom strategy, and then strike.)\nPeople are notoriously bad at creating actually random series. They\ntend to switch too often, avoiding choosing the same move two or three\n",

Put\nyour finger “at random” somewhere on the table, and copy down the next\nhundred digits. Throw out all the 0s (say), and then replace each 1, 2, or 3\nwith “R” (for rock), each 4, 5, and 6, with “P” (for paper), and each 7, 8,\nand 9 with “S” (for scissors). This will give you a sequence of\napproximately ninety moves (since you threw out approximately ten 0s),\nwhich should be enough for a match.\nNow you’re ready to play, and the cardinal rule is: keep your list secret.\nIf your opponent gets to peek at it, you will be completely at her mercy.\nAs the saying goes, she will turn you into a money pump.

Suppose, for instance, your random-number generator is a\nprogram that can be specified in, say, a megabyte—eight million bits—\nbut it generates a sequence (the same sequence every time) that is\nactually infinite. If you wanted to send somebody this infinite series, you\nwouldn’t have to do so in an infinitely long e-mail message recording the\nseries verbatim. You could just send them your megabyte-long algorithm\nand they’d have access to the entire infinite series. That is the\nfundamental idea of a pseudo-random-number generator. Whenever you\nstart the random-number generator from a cold start—whenever you\nreboot your computer, for instance—it will always yield exactly the same\nsequence of digits, but a sequence that is as apparently patternless as if it\nwere generated by genuinely random quantum fluctuations. It is a built-in\n“table of random numbers,” you might say, rather like what you would\nget on a very long loop of videotape, recording the history of a fair\nroulette wheel over millions of spins. The loop always returns to “the\nbeginning” when you start up your computer.

If an agent that\napparently has free will is actually deterministic, living in a deterministic\nworld, does this remove all choice, all opportunity? Here is an intuition\npump that explores the question by looking at a simplified world—chess\nplaying—in an artificially constructed deterministic world: the world of\nactivity performed by a computer.\nSuppose you install two different chess-playing programs on your\ncomputer and yoke them together with a little supervisory program that\npits them against each other, game after game, in a potentially endless\nseries. Will they play the same game, over and over, until you turn off the\ncomputer? You could set it up like that, but then you wouldn’t learn\nanything interesting about the two programs, A and B. Suppose A beats B\nin this oft-repeated game. You couldn’t infer from this that A is a better\nprogram in general than B, or that A would beat B in a different game,\nand you wouldn’t be able to learn anything from the exact repetition\nabout the strengths and weaknesses of the two different programs. Much\nmore informative would be to set up the tournament so that A and B play\na succession of different games. This can be readily arranged. If either\nchess program consults the random-number generator during its\ncalculations (if, for instance, it periodically “flips a coin” to escape from\nsituations where it has no handy reason for doing one thing versus\nanother in the course of its searching for a good move), then in the\nfollowing game the state of the random-number generator will have\nchanged (unless you arrange to have it re-initialized), and hence different\nalternatives will be explored, in a different order, leading on occasion to\ndifferent moves being “chosen.” A variant game will blossom, and the\nthird game will be different in different ways, resulting in a series in\n",

One way we could put\nit is apparently paradoxical:\nA could have castled at time t but the universe couldn’t have had a\ncastling event at time t.\nWhat could possibly license this way of describing the situation?

I will revise the earlier\nargument into a form a little closer to Strawson’s to bring out the\nsimilarities.\n \n1. A mammal is a mammal, in any given context, because of the way it is.\n2. In order to be a mammal, you have to become the way you are by\nhaving a mammal for a mother.\n3. But this must be true of your mother, and her mother, and so forth ad\ninfinitum, which is impossible.\n4. So you cannot be a mammal because mammals are utterly impossible.\nYou should always be leery of any such “ancestral” argument. It is\nalmost certain to be a disguised instance of the ancient fallacy known as\nthe sorites (or “heap”) argument:\n \n1. A single grain of wheat is not a heap.\n2. Adding a grain to a single grain does not make a heap.\n3. You can’t make a non-heap into a heap by adding a single grain.\n4. Therefore there are no such things as heaps!\n",

The defining example of sphexishness, and the source of the\nterm, is a wasp with a curious behavior. Doug and I had independently\nbeen struck by a passage in a popular science book, The Machinery of the\nBrain, written by Dean Wooldridge (1963), who described the Sphex\nwasp thus:\nWhen the time comes for egg-laying, the wasp Sphex builds a\nburrow for the purpose and seeks out a cricket which she stings in\nsuch a way as to paralyze but not kill it. She drags the cricket into\nthe burrow, lays her eggs alongside, closes the burrow, then flies\naway, never to return. In due course, the eggs hatch and the wasp\ngrubs feed off the paralyzed cricket, which has not decayed, having\nbeen kept in the wasp equivalent of deep freeze. To the human mind,\nsuch an elaborately organized and seemingly purposeful routine\nconveys a convincing flavor of logic and thoughtfulness—until more\ndetails are examined. For example, the wasp’s routine is to bring the\nparalyzed cricket to the burrow, leave it on the threshold, go inside\nto see that all is well, emerge, and then drag the cricket in. If the\ncricket is moved a few inches away while the wasp is inside making\nher preliminary inspection, the wasp, on emerging from the burrow,\nwill bring the cricket back to the threshold, but not inside, and will\nthen repeat the preparatory procedure of entering the burrow to see\nthat everything is all right. If again the cricket is removed a few\ninches while the wasp is inside, once again she will move the cricket\nup to the threshold and re-enter the burrow for a final check. The\nwasp never thinks of pulling the cricket straight in. On one occasion\n",

The psychologist\nLars Chittka, in a note to me, quoted from the work of Jean-Henri Fabre\n(in 1879), which had apparently been the source for Wooldridge, who, if\nhe had read on in Fabre, would have found that in fact only some Sphex\nwasps are sphexish. In fact, Fabre was eager to make the point. If at first\nblush you thought Sphex was clever, and at second blush you thought\nSphex was stupid, try third blush, and find that some Sphex wasps are not\nso sphexish after all. Chittka sent me the German translation of Fabre (I\nstill haven’t located the French), which includes the following sentence:\n“Nach zwei oder drei Malen, . . . packt ihre Fuehler mit den Kieferzangen\nund schleift sie in die Hoehle.

(Which habitat would you vote\nto protect, Sphex habitat or Humdrumbeetle habitat?) Sphex wasps may\nnot be “charismatic” like elephants and tigers and wolves, but they are\nrather well known—for their problematic sphexishness.\nSphexishness is an important property not so much because so many\nwhole, simple animals—insects, worms, fish—exhibit it (though they do,\nin varying degrees), but because it gives us a term for the limited,\nrobotic, myopic, competences out of which we can build fancier, more\nversatile, comprehending minds.

The philosopher Harry\nFrankfurt (1969) invented an intuition pump in which a person is being\nmonitored by secretly implanted neurostimulation gadgetry that is\ncontrolled by a neurosurgeon who makes sure that that person decides the\nway he wants that person to decide.

THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL: ANOTHER BOOM CRUTCH\n \nIn 2004, the psychologists Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen co-\nauthored “For the Law, Neuroscience Changes Everything and Nothing,”\nwhich \nwas \npublished \nin \nthe \nprestigious \njournal Philosophical\nTransactions of the Royal Society. This influential article conjures up a\nrevolution in the law, triggered by scientific discoveries.\n[T]he law says that it presupposes nothing more than a\nmetaphysically modest notion of free will that is perfectly\ncompatible with determinism. However, we argue that the law’s\nintuitive support is ultimately grounded in a metaphysically\noverambitious, libertarian [indeterministic] notion of free will that\nis threatened by determinism and, more pointedly, by forthcoming\ncognitive neuroscience. [p. 1776]\nThe case they make is subtle; it has to be, because they grant that there\nare a wealth of arguments in support of compatibilism (the view defended\nby me here), but they want to show that actually “we are all of two\nminds” about free will. They offer a thought experiment designed to\nreveal \nthe \ndependence \nof everyday commonsense thinking on\nindeterminism. Note that this is pretty much what I’ve just been calling\nfor: show us, please, both that \nand why we should care about\nindeterminism. Their thought experiment was inspired by the film The\nBoys from Brazil, about Nazi scientists who raise Hitler clones (thanks to\nsome salvaged DNA). Here it is:\nLet us suppose, then, that a group of scientists has managed to create\nan individual—call him Mr Puppet—who, by design, engages in\nsome criminal behavior: say, a murder done during a drug deal gone\nbad.

The thought that\nMr Puppet is not fully responsible depends on the idea that his\nactions were externally determined. . . .

A FAUSTIAN BARGAIN\n \nFor several years, I have been posing the following choice for my fellow\nphilosophers: If Mephistopheles offered you the following two options,\nwhich would you choose?\n(A) You solve the major philosophical problem of your choice so\nconclusively that there is nothing left to say (thanks to you, part of\nthe field closes down forever, and you get a footnote in history).\n(B) You write a book of such tantalizing perplexity and controversy\nthat it stays on the required reading list for centuries to come.\nSome philosophers reluctantly admit that they would have to go for\noption (B). If they had to choose, they would rather be read than right.\nLike composers, poets, novelists, and other creators in the arts, they tend\nto want their work to be experienced, over and over, by millions (billions,\nif possible!). But they are also tugged in the direction of the scientists’\nquest. After all, philosophers are supposed to be trying to get at the truth.\nWhen I present the same Faustian bargain to scientists, they tend to opt\nfor (A) without any hesitation—it’s a no-brainer for them. And then they\nshake their heads in wonder (or disgust?) when they learn that this is a\nhard choice for many philosophers, some of whom opt, somewhat\nsheepishly, for (B). But this reaction by scientists misses the important\npoint made by Nicholas Humphrey (1987) (see chapter 48):\nIn Two Cultures, C. P. Snow extolled the great discoveries of science\nas “scientific Shakespeare,” but in one way he was fundamentally\nmistaken. Shakespeare’s plays were Shakespeare’s plays and no one\nelse’s; scientific discoveries, by contrast, belong—ultimately—to no\none in particular.\nIf Shakespeare hadn’t existed, nobody else would have written Hamlet or\nRomeo and Juliet or King Lear. If Van Gogh hadn’t existed, nobody else\nwould have painted Starry Night. This may be a slight exaggeration, but\n",

These contests have no parallel in the arts, where a different set\nof goals reigns.\nSome scientists aspire to reach large readerships, and to delight the\nreaders they catch, and the best write works of surpassing literary value.\nDarwin’s books come to mind.

PHILOSOPHY AS NAÏVE AUTO-ANTHROPOLOGY\n \nPatrick Hayes, the artificial intelligence researcher, once set out on a\nproject to axiomatize the naïve (or folk) physics of liquids. The idea was\nto provide a robot with the propositions it would need to use as its core\nbeliefs if it was going to interact with people (who rely on folk physics\nevery day). It proved to be more challenging than he had anticipated, and\nhe wrote an interesting paper about the project, “The Naïve Physics\nManifesto” (Hayes, 1978). In the naïve physics of liquids, everything that\nstrikes naïve folks as counterintuitive is, of course, ruled out: siphons are\n“impossible” and so are pipettes, but you can mop up liquid with a fluffy\ntowel, and pull water out of a well with a suction pump. A robot equipped\nwith such a store of “knowledge” would be as surprised by a siphon as\nmost of us were when first we saw one in action. Hayes’s project was\nwhat I would call sophisticated naïve physics, because he was under no\nillusions; he knew the theory he was trying to axiomatize was false,\nhowever useful in daily life. This was an exercise in what might be called\naxiomatic anthropology: you treat what the folks say—and agree about—\nas your axioms or theorems, and try to render the data set consistent,\nresolving any contradictions encountered. And, of course, he didn’t\nbother rounding up any actual informants; he figured that he knew the\nnaïve physics of liquids as well as any normal person did, so he used\nhimself as his sole informant: axiomatic auto-anthropology.1\nNow compare Hayes’s project with the philosophical projects in\nanalytic metaphysics, which often strike me as naïve naïve auto-\nanthropology since the participants in this research seem to be convinced\nthat their program actually gets at something true, not just something\nbelieved true by a particular subclass of human beings (Anglophone\nphilosophers of the analytic metaphysics persuasion). Otherwise, the\nprograms seem identical: you gather your shared intuitions, test and\nprovoke them by engaging in mutual intuition-pumping, and then try to\nmassage the resulting data set into a consistent “theory,” based on\n“received” principles that count, ideally, as axioms.

I propose that this is the\nenterprise to which analytic metaphysicians should turn, since it requires\nrather minimal adjustments to their methods and only one major revision\nof \ntheir raison d’être: they must roll back their pretensions and\nacknowledge that their research is best seen as a preparatory\nreconnaissance of the terrain of the manifest image, suspending both\nbelief and disbelief the way anthropologists do when studying an exotic\nculture: let’s pretend for the nonce that the natives are right, and see what\nfalls out. Since at least a large part of philosophy’s task, in my vision of\nthe discipline, consists in negotiating the traffic back and forth between\nthe manifest and scientific images, it is a good idea for philosophers to\nanalyze what they are up against in the way of folk assumptions before\nlaunching into their theory-building and theory-criticizing.\nOne of the hallmarks of sophisticated naïve anthropology is its\nopenness to counterintuitive discoveries. As long as you’re doing naïve\nanthropology, counterintuitiveness (to the natives) counts against your\nreconstruction; when you shift gears and begin asking which aspects of\nthe naïve “theory” are true, counterintuitiveness loses its force as an\nobjection and even becomes, on occasion, a sign of significant progress.\nIn science in general, counterintuitive results are prized, after all.\nOne of the weaknesses of auto-anthropology is that one’s own intuitions\nare apt to be distorted by one’s theoretical predilections. Linguists have\nknown for a long time that they get so wrapped up in their theories they\nare no longer reliable sources of linguistic intuition. Can you really say in\nEnglish, “The boy the man the woman kissed punched ran away,” or is\nmy theory of clause embedding tricking my “ear”? Their raw, untutored\nintuitions have been sullied by too much theory, so they recognize that\nthey must go out and ask nonlinguists for their linguistic intuitions.\n",

It is early days still, and some of the pioneer efforts are\nunimpressive, but at least philosophers are getting used to the idea that\nthey can no longer declare various propositions to be obviously true on\nthe sole grounds that they seem smashingly obvious to them. (In a similar\nvein, Hayes might have surprised himself about the chief tenets of folk\nphysics if he had gone to the trouble of interviewing a random sample of\nfolk instead of just treating himself as exemplary.)\nSo here is a project, a particular sort of sophisticated naïve\nanthropology, that philosophers should seriously consider undertaking as\na survey of the terrain of the commonsense or manifest image of the\nworld before launching into their theories of knowledge, justice, beauty,\ntruth, goodness, time, causation, and so on, to make sure they actually\naim their analyses and arguments at targets that are relevant to the rest of\nthe world, both lay concerns and scientific concerns. Such a systematic\ninquiry would yield something like a catalogue of the unreformed\nconceptual terrain that sets the problems for the theorist, the metaphysics\nof the manifest image, if you like.

HIGHER-ORDER TRUTHS OF CHMESS\n \nConsider this chess puzzle.1 White to checkmate in two.\n \nIt appeared recently in the Boston Globe, and what startled me was that I\nhad thought it had been proved that you can’t checkmate with a lone\nknight (and a king, of course). I was wrong; as David Misialowski\npointed out to me in a recent e-mail, it has been proved that you cannot\ncheckmate your opponent’s king when only his king and your king and\nknight are on the board. The fact that the proposition you can never\ncheckmate with a lone knight and king is not a truth of chess is a higher-\norder truth of chess.\nPhilosophy is traditionally an a priori discipline, like mathematics, or\nat least it has an a priori methodology at its core, and this fact cuts two\nways. On the one hand, it excuses philosophers from spending tedious\nhours in the lab or out in the field, and from learning data-gathering\ntechniques, statistical methods, geography, history, foreign languages,\nempirical science, and so on, so they have plenty of time for honing their\nphilosophical skills. On the other hand, as is often noted, philosophy can\nbe created out of just about anything, and this is not always a blessing.\nFor those of you younger readers who are thinking of undertaking a\ncareer in the field, and I hope some of you are, this chapter is a warning\nthat the very freedom and abstractness of philosophy can be weaknesses.\n",

No knowledge of these empirical facts plays an\nindispensable role in the activity of working out the a priori truths of\nchess, which also exist in abundance. All you need to know are the rules\nof the game. There are exactly twenty legal opening moves (sixteen pawn\nmoves and four knight moves); a king and a lone bishop cannot achieve\ncheckmate against a lone king, and neither can a king and a lone knight,\nand so forth. Working out these a priori truths about chess is not always\neasy. Proving just what is and is not possible within the rules of chess is\nan intricate task, and mistakes can be made. For instance, a few years\nago, a computer chess program discovered a mating net—a guaranteed or\nforced win—consisting of more than two hundred moves without a\ncapture. This disproved a long-standing “theorem” of chess and has\nforced a change in the rules of the game. It used to be that fifty moves\nwithout a capture by either side constituted a draw (stalemate), but since\nthis lengthy mating net is unbreakable, and leads to a win, it is\nunreasonable to maintain the fifty-move stalemate. (Before computers\nbegan playing chess, nobody imagined that there could be a guaranteed\nwin anywhere near this length.) All this can be pretty interesting, and\nmany highly intelligent people have devoted their minds to investigating\nthis system of a priori truths of chess.2\nSome philosophical research projects—or problematics, to speak with\nthe more literary types—are rather like working out the truths of chess. A\nset of mutually agreed-upon rules are presupposed—and seldom\ndiscussed—and the implications of those rules are worked out,\narticulated, debated, refined. So far, so good.

You will get something—a lot, really—\nout of reading Aristotle or Kant or Nietzsche on your own, without any\nbackground, but you’ll get a lot more if you accept some guidance from\nthose who have specialized in these thinkers for their entire careers.\nNot all historians of philosophy have the same goals and attitudes, and I\nfor one see no good reason for disqualifying any of the contenders. Some\ninsist on placing their thinkers in the historical context in which they\nwrote, which means, for instance, learning a lot of seventeenth-century\nscience if you really want to understand Descartes, and a lot of\nseventeenth- and eighteenth-century political history if you really want to\nunderstand Locke or Hume, and always, of course, a lot of the philosophy\nof their lesser contemporaries as well. Why bother with the also-rans?\nThere’s a good reason. I found I never really appreciated many of the\npainters of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries until I visited\nEuropean museums where I could see room after room full of second-rate\npaintings of the same genres. If all you ever see is the good stuff—which\nis all you see in the introductory survey courses, and in the top museums\n—it’s very hard to see just how wonderful the good stuff is. Do you know\nthe difference between a good library and a great library? A good library\nhas all the good books. A great library has all the books. If you really\nwant to understand a great philosopher, you have to spend some time\nlooking at the less great contemporaries and predecessors that are left in\nthe shadows of the masters.\nOther specialists touch only lightly on the historic contexts in which\ntheir heroes worked, and instead concentrate on showing how to translate\nthe ideas into today’s contexts.

In the end, you’re not taking\nany philosopher seriously until you ask whether or not what they say is\nright. Philosophy students—and professors—sometimes forget this, and\nconcentrate on pigeonholing and engaging in “compare and contrast,” as\nwe say in examination questions. Whole philosophy departments\nsometimes fall into this vision of their goal. That’s not philosophy; that’s\njust philosophy appreciation. This is how I try to help my students break\nthis habit:\nYou’ve stumbled on a terrible secret—a plot to destroy the Statue of\nLiberty, say, or to bring down the national electric grid. You work\nfeverishly to gather and marshal your evidence, and then compose a\nletter that draws on all your eloquence. You send copies to the\npolice, the FBI, the New York Times, CNN, and this is the response\nyou get: “Ah, another very clever example of post-9/11 conspiracy\ntheory” and “a gripping read, actually, and quite plausible in its own\nway, with excellent touches” and “reminds me of Dom De Lillo,\nwith echoes of Pynchon.” Aaargh! Pay attention! I’m trying to tell\nyou the truth!

There is almost no work in the\nphilosophy of chemistry or astronomy or geology or engineering as such,\nbut there is good work on some of the conceptual issues that arise in these\nfields. And then there is ethics. In 1971 John Rawls published A Theory of\nJustice, a towering work that opened up a fruitful era of philosophers who\napproach the traditional topics of ethics with an eye on the social\nsciences, especially economics and political science, but also biology and\npsychology.

TRY HARDER.\n \n“It’s inconceivable!” That’s what some people declare when they\nconfront the “mystery” of consciousness, or the claim that life arose on\nthis planet more than three billion years ago without any helping hand\nfrom an Intelligent Designer, for instance. When I hear this, I am always\ntempted to say, “Well of course it’s inconceivable to you. You left your\nthinking tools behind and you’re hardly trying.” Recall William\nBateson’s firm declaration that a material basis for genes was\ninconceivable. Even schoolchildren have little difficulty conceiving of\nDNA today, and it’s not because they are more brilliant than Bateson was.\nIt’s because in the last century we have devised and refined the thinking\ntools that make it a snap. Of course some people really don’t want to\nconceive of these things. They want to protect the mysteries from even an\nattempt at explanation, for fear that an explanation might make the\ntreasures disappear.\nWhen other people start getting inquisitive, they find that “God works\nin mysterious ways” is a convenient anti-thinking tool. By hinting that\nthe questioner is arrogant and overreaching, it can quench curiosity in an\ninstant. It used to work well, and still works well in the communities\nwhere ignorance of science is regarded as a negligible flaw if not actually\na virtue. I think we should stop treating this “pious” observation as any\nkind of wisdom and recognize it as the transparently defensive\npropaganda that it is. A positive response might be, “Oh good! I love a\nmystery. Let’s see if we can solve this one, too.

Then there was\nthe Javanese shadow-puppet dramatization produced by the well-known\npuppeteer Lynn Jeffries at Harvard’s Loeb Theater in 1984. Google\nleaves no doubt that it is readily available, along with a flood of\ncommentaries.\n“The Ballad of Shakey’s Pizza Parlor” (in Dennett, 1982a) does serious\nwork dismantling a set of presumptions about “de re and de dicto belief”\nthat were once dominant in the thinking of some philosophers working on\nintentionality, but that were unfamiliar to everyone else.

Only one of those is\nincluded here, the Curse of the Cauliflower, to help introduce the\nconcept and a major problem with qualia. “Quining Qualia” might be\nconsidered supplementary reading on the topic for anyone who still\nthinks the concept of qualia (as philosophers like to define it) is a good\nidea. The essay has often been anthologized and is readily available on\nthe Internet, in several languages. My book Sweet Dreams (2005b)\ncontains yet other arguments and intuition pumps on the topic.

These tools have enabled \nworkers in the historical field to distinguish various sedimentary strata; linear successions, which for so long \nhad been the object of research, have given way to discoveries in depth. From the political mobility at the \nsurface down to the slow movements of `material civilization', ever more levels of analysis have been \nestablished: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, \nthe rhythms become broader.

    "chunk_full": "changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of \nsea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the \nhistory of the balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance. The old questions of the \ntraditional analysis (What link should be made between disparate events? How can a causal succession be established \nbetween them? What continuity or overall significance do they possess? Is it possible to define a totality, or must one be \ncontent with reconstituting connexions?) are now being replaced by questions of another type: which strata should be \nisolated from others? What types of series should be established? What criteria of periodization should be adopted for \neach of them? What system of relations (hierarchy, dominance, stratification, univocal determination, circular causality) \nmay be established between them? What series of series may be established? And in what large-scale chronological table \nmay distinct series of events be determined? \nAt about the same time, in the disciplines that we call the history of ideas, the history of science, the history of \nphilosophy, the history of thought, and the history of literature (we can ignore their specificity for the moment), in those \ndisciplines which, despite their names, evade very largely the work and methods of the historian, attention has been \nturned, on the contrary, away from vast unities like `periods' or `centuries' to the phenomena of rupture, of discontinuity. \nBeneath the great continuities of thought, beneath the solid, homogeneous manifestations of a single mind or of a \ncollective mentality, beneath the stubborn development of a science striving to exist and to reach completion at the very \noutset, beneath the persistence of a particular genre, form, discipline, or theoretical activity, one is now trying to detect \nthe incidence of interruptions. Interruptions whose status and nature vary considerably. There are the epistemological \nacts and thresholds described by Bachelard: they suspend the continuous accumulation of knowledge, interrupt its slow \ndevelopment, and force it to enter a new time, cut it off from its empirical origin and its original motivations, cleanse it \nof its imaginary complicities; they direct historical analysis away from the search for silent beginnings, and the never-\nending tracing-back to the original precursors, towards the search for a new type of rationality \n((5)) \nand its various effects. There are the displacements and transformations of concepts: the analyses of G. Canguilhem may \nserve as models; they show that the history of a concept is not wholly and entirely that of its progressive refinement, its \ncontinuously increasing rationality, its abstraction gradient, but that of its various fields of constitution and validity, that \nof its successive rules of use, that of the many theoretical contexts in which it developed and matured. There is the \ndistinction, which we also owe to Canguilhem, between the microscopic and macroscopic scales of the history of the \nsciences, in which events and their consequences are not arranged in the same way: thus a discovery, the development of \na method, the achievements, and the failures, of a particular scientist, do not have the same incidence, and cannot be \ndescribed in the same way at both levels; on each of the two levels, a different history is being written. Recurrent \nredistributions reveal several pasts, several forms of connexion, several hierarchies of importance, several networks of \ndetermination, several teleologies, for one and the same science, as its present undergoes change: thus historical descrip-\ntions are necessarily ordered by the present state of knowledge, they increase with every transformation and never cease, \nin turn, to break with themselves (in the field of mathematics, M. Serres has provided the theory of this phenomenon). \nThere are the architectonic unities of systems of the kind analysed by M. Gueroult, which are concerned not with the \ndescription of cultural influences, traditions, and continuities, but with internal coherences, axioms, deductive \nconnexions, compatibilities. Lastly, the most radical discontinuities are the breaks effected by a work of theoretical \ntransformation 'which establishes a science by detaching it from the ideology of its past and by revealing this past as \nideological'.' To this should be added, of course, literary analysis, which now takes as its unity, not the spirit or sensibility \nof a period, nor 'groups', 'schools', 'generations', or 'movements', nor even the personality of the author, in the interplay of \nhis life and his 'creation', but the particular structure of a given auvre, book, or text. \nAnd the great problem presented by such historical analyses is not how continuities are established, how a single \npattern is formed and preserved, how for so many different, successive minds there is a single \n \n \n((footnote)) \nL. Althusser, For Marx, London, Allen Lane; New York, Pantheon, 1969, p. 168. \n \n \n((6)) \nhorizon, what mode of action and what substructure is implied by the interplay of transmissions, resumptions, \ndisappearances, and repetitions, how the origin may extend its sway well beyond itself to that conclusion that is never \ngiven — the problem is no longer one of tradition, of tracing a line, but one of division, of limits; it is no longer one of \nlasting foundations, but one of transformations that serve as new foundations, the rebuilding of foundations.

    "chunk_full": "seeing, then, is the emergence of a whole field of questions, some of which are already familiar, by which this new form \nof history is trying to develop its own theory: how is one to specify the different concepts that enable us to conceive of \ndiscontinuity (threshold, rupture, break, mutation, transformation) ? By what criteria is one to isolate the unities with \nwhich one is dealing; what is a science? What is an oeuvre? What is a theory? What is a concept? What is a text? How is \none to diversify the levels at which one may place oneself, each of which possesses its own divisions and form of \nanalysis? What is the legitimate level of formalization? What is that of interpretation? Of structural analysis? Of \nattributions of causality? \nIn short, the history of thought, of knowledge, of philosophy, of literature seems to be seeking, and discovering, more \nand more discontinuities, whereas history itself appears to be abandoning the irruption of events in favour of stable \nstructures. \n \nBut we must not be taken in by this apparent interchange. Despite appearances, we must not imagine that certain of the \nhistorical disciplines have moved from the continuous to the discontinuous, while others have moved from the tangled \nmass of discontinuities to the great, uninterrupted unities; we must not imagine that in the analysis of politics, \ninstitutions, or economics, we have become more and more sensitive to overall determinations, while in the analysis of \nideas and of knowledge, we are paying more and more attention to the play of difference; we must not imagine that these \ntwo great forms of description have crossed without recognizing one another. \nIn fact, the same problems are being posed in either case, but they have provoked opposite effects on the surface. \nThese problems may be summed up in a word: the questioning of the document. Of course, it is obvious enough that \never since a discipline such as history has existed, \n((7)) \ndocuments have been used, questioned, and have given rise to questions; scholars have asked not only what these \ndocuments meant, but also whether they were telling the truth, and by what right they could claim to be doing so, \nwhether they were sincere or deliberately misleading, well informed or ignorant, authentic or tampered with. But each of \nthese questions, and all this critical concern, pointed to one and the same end: the reconstitution, on the basis of what the \ndocuments say, and sometimes merely hint at, of the past from which they emanate and which has now disappeared far \nbehind them; the document was always treated as the language of a voice since reduced to silence, its fragile, but \npossibly decipherable trace. Now, through a mutation that is not of very recent origin, but which has still not come to an \nend, history has altered its position in relation to the document: it has taken as its primary task, not the interpretation of \nthe document, nor the attempt to decide whether it is telling the truth or what is its expressive value, but to work on it \nfrom within and to develop it: history now organizes the document, divides it up, distributes it, orders it, arranges it in \nlevels, establishes series, distinguishes between what is relevant and what is not, discovers elements, defines unities, \ndescribes relations. The document, then, is no longer for history an inert material through which it tries to reconstitute \nwhat men have done or said, the events of which only the trace remains; history is now trying to define within the \ndocumentary material itself unities, totalities, series, relations. His-tory must be detached from the image that satisfied it \nfor so long, and through which it found its anthropological justification: that of an age-old collective consciousness that \nmade use of material documents to refresh its memory; history is the work expended on material documentation (books, \ntexts, accounts, registers, acts, buildings, institutions, laws, techniques, objects, customs, etc.) that exists, in every time \nand place, in every society, either in a spontaneous or in a consciously organized form. The document is not the \nfortunate tool of a history that is primarily and fundamentally memory; history is one way in which a society recognizes \nand develops a mass of documentation with which it is inextricably linked. \nTo be brief, then, let us say that history, in its traditional form, undertook to `memorize' the monuments of the past, \ntransform them into documents, and lend speech to those traces which, in themselves, are \n \n \n((8)) \noften not verbal, or which say in silence something other than what they actually say; in our time, history is that which \ntransforms documents into monuments. In that area where, in the past, history deciphered the traces left by men, it now \ndeploys a mass of elements that have to be grouped, made relevant, placed in relation to one another to form totalities. \nThere was a time when archaeology, as a discipline devoted to silent monuments, inert traces, objects without context, \nand things left by the past, aspired to the condition of history, and attained meaning only through the restitution of a \nhistorical discourse; it might be said, to play on words a little, that in our time history aspires to the condition of \narchaeology, to the intrinsic description of the monument. \nThis has several consequences. First of all, there is the surface effect already mentioned: the proliferation of \ndiscontinuities in the history of ideas, and the emergence of long periods in history proper. In fact, in its traditional form, \nhistory proper was concerned to define relations (of simple causality, of circular determination, of antagonism, of \nexpression) between facts or dated events: the series being known, it was simply a question of defining the position of \neach element in relation to the other elements in the series. The problem now is to constitute series: to define the elements \nproper to each series, to fix its boundaries, to reveal its own specific type of relations, to formulate its laws,  \nand, beyond this, to describe the relations between different series, thus constituting series of series, or `tables': hence the \never-increasing number of strata, and the need to distinguish them, the specificity of their time and chronologies; hence \nthe need to distinguish not only important events (with a long chain of consequences) and less important ones, but types \n",

The appearance of long periods in the history of today is not a return to the \nphilosophers of history, to the great ages of the world, or to the periodization dictated by the rise and fall of civilizations; \nit is the effect of the methodologically concerted development \n \n \n((9)) \n \nof series. In the history of ideas, of thought and of the sciences, the same mutation has brought about the opposite effect; \nit has broken up the long series formed by the progress of consciousness, or the teleology of reason, or the evolution of \nhuman thought; it has questioned the themes of convergence and culmination; it has doubted the possibility of creating \ntotalities. It has led to the individualization of different series, which are juxtaposed to one another, follow one another, \noverlap and intersect, without one being able to reduce them to a liner schema. Thus, in place of the continuous \nchronology of reason, which was invariably traced back to some inaccessible origin, there have appeared scales that are \nsometimes very brief, distinct from one another, irreducible to a single law, scales that bear a type of history peculiar to \neach one, and which cannot be reduced to the general model of a consciousness that acquires, progresses, and \nremembers. \nSecond consequence: the notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines. For history in its \nclassical form, the discontinuous was both the given and the unthinkable: the raw material of history, which presented \nitself in the form of dispersed events — decisions, accidents, initiatives, discoveries; the material, which, through \nanalysis, had to be rearranged, reduced, effaced in order to reveal the continuity of events. Discontinuity was the stigma \nof temporal dislocation that it was the historian's task to remove from history. It has now become one of the basic \nelements of historical analysis. Its role is threefold. First, it constitutes a deliberate operation on the part of the historian \n(and not a quality of the material with which he has to deal): for the must, at least as a systematic hypothesis, distinguish \nthe possible levels of analysis, the methods proper to each, and the periodization that best suits them. Secondly, it is the \nresult of his description (and not something that must be eliminated by means of his analysis) : for he is trying to \ndiscover the limits of a process, the point of inflexion of a curve, the inversion of a regulatory movement, the boundaries \nof an oscillation, the threshold of a function, the instant at which a circular causality breaks down. Thirdly, it is the \nconcept that the historian's work never ceases to specify (instead of neglecting it as a uniform, indifferent blank between \ntwo positive figures) ; it assumes a specific form and function according to the field and the level to which it is assigned: \none does not speak of the same discontinuity when \n((10)) \ndescribing an epistemological threshold, the point of reflexion in a population curve, or the replacement of one technique \nby another. The notion of discontinuity is a paradoxical one: because it is both an instrument and an object of research; \nbecause it divides up the field of which it is the effect; because it enables the historian to individualize different domains \nbut can be established only by comparing those domains. And because, in the final analysis, perhaps, it is not simply a \nconcept present in the discourse of the historian, but something that the historian secretly supposes to be present: on \nwhat basis, in fact, could he speak without this discontinuity that offers him history — and his own history — as an \nobject? One of the most essential features of the new history is probably this displacement of the discontinuous: its \ntransference from the obstacle to the work itself; its integration into the discourse of the historian, where it no longer \nplays the role of an external condition that must be reduced, but that of a working concept; and therefore the inversion of \nsigns by which it is no longer the negative of the historical reading (its underside, its failure, the limit of its power), but \nthe positive element that determines its object and validates its analysis. \nThird consequence: the theme and the possibility of a total history begin to disappear, and we see the emergence of \nsomething very different that might be called a general history. The project of a total history is one that seeks to \nreconstitute the overall form of a civilization, the principle — material or spiritual — of a society, the significance com-\nmon to all the phenomena of a period, the law that accounts for their cohesion — what is called metaphorically the `face' \nof a period. Such a project is linked to two or three hypotheses; it is supposed that between all the events of a well-\ndefined spatio-temporal area, between all the phenomena of which traces have been found, it must be possible to \nestablish a system of homogeneous relations: a network of causality that makes it possible to derive each of them, \nrelations of analogy that show how they symbolize one another, or how they all express one and the same central core; it \nis also supposed that one and the same form of historicity operates upon economic structures, social institutions and \ncustoms, the inertia of mental attitudes, technological practice, political behaviour, and subjects them all to the same \ntype of transformation; lastly, it is supposed that history itself may be articulated into \n \n \n",

These are the \npostulates that are challenged by the new history when it speaks of series, divisions, limits, differences of level, shifts, \nchronological specificities, particular forms of rehandling, possible types of relation. This is not because it is trying to \nobtain a plurality of histories juxtaposed and independent of one another: that of the economy beside that of institutions, \nand beside these two those of science, religion, or literature; nor is it because it is merely trying to discover between \nthese different histories coincidences of dates, or analogies of form and meaning. The problem that now presents itself \n— and which defines the task of a general history — is to determine what form of relation may be legitimately described \nbetween these different series; what vertical system they are capable of forming; what interplay of correlation and \ndominance exists between them; what may be the effect of shifts, different temporalities, and various rehandlings; in \nwhat distinct totalities certain elements may figure simultaneously; in short, not only what series, but also what 'series of \nseries' — or, in other words, what 'tables' it is possible to draw up. A total description draws all phenomena around a \nsingle centre — a principle, a meaning, a spirit, a world-view, an overall shape; a general history, on the contrary, would \ndeploy the space of a dispersion. \nFourth and last consequence: the new history is confronted by a number of methodological problems, several of \nwhich, no doubt, existed long before the emergence of the new history, but which, taken together, characterize it. These \ninclude: the building-up of coherent and homogeneous corpora of documents (open or closed, exhausted or inexhaustible \ncorpora), the establishment of a principle of choice (according to whether one wishes to treat the documentation exhaust-\nively, or adopt a sampling method as in statistics, or try to determine in advance which are the most representative \nelements) ; the definition of the level of analysis and of the relevant elements (in the material stud-ied, one may extract \nnumerical indications; references — explicit or not — to events, institutions, practices; the words used, with their \ngrammatical rules and the semantic fields that they indicate, or again the formal structure of the propositions and the \ntypes of connexion that unite them); the specification of a method of analysis (the quantitative treatment of data, the \nbreaking-down of the material according to a \n \n \n((12)) \nnumber of assignable features whose correlations are then studied, interpretative decipherment, analysis of frequency and \ndistribution); the delimitation of groups and sub-groups that articulate the material (regions, periods, unitary processes) ; \nthe determination of relations that make it possible to characterize a group (these may be numerical or logical relations; \nfunctional, causal, or analogical relations; or it may be the relation of the 'signifier' (signifiant) to the 'signified' (signifie). \nAll these problems are now part of the methodological field of his-tory. This field deserves attention, and for two \nreasons. First, because one can see to what extent it has freed itself from what constituted, not so long ago, the philosophy \nof history, and from the questions that it posed (on the rationality or teleology of historical development (devenir), on the \nrelativity of historical knowledge, and on the possibility of discovering or constituting a meaning in the inertia of the past \nand in the unfinished totality of the present). Secondly, because it intersects at certain points problems that are met with in \nother fields — in linguistics, ethnology, economics, literary analysis, and mythology, for example. These problems may, \nif one so wishes, be labelled structuralism. But only under certain conditions: they do not, of themselves, cover the entire \nmethodological field of history, they occupy only one part of that field — a part that varies in importance with the area \nand level of analysis; apart from a number of relatively limited cases, they have not been imported from linguistics or \nethnology (as is often the case today), but they originated in the field of history itself — more particularly, in that of \neconomic history and as a result of the questions posed by that discipline; lastly, in no way do they authorize us to speak \nof a structuralism of history, or at least of an attempt to overcome a 'conflict' or 'opposition' between structure and \nhistorical develop-ment: it is a long time now since historians uncovered, described, and analysed structures, without ever \nhaving occasion to wonder whether they were not allowing the living, fragile, pulsating 'history' to slip through their \nfingers. The structure/development opposition is relevant neither to the definition of the historical field, nor, in all \nprobability, to the definition of a structural method. \nThis epistemological mutation of history is not yet complete. But it is \nnot of recent origin either, since its first phase can no doubt be traced \n \n \n((13)) \nback to Marx. But it took a long time to have much effect. Even now — and this is especially true in the case of the \nhistory of thought — it has been neither registered nor reflected upon, while other, more recent transformations — those \nof linguistics, for example — have been. It is as if it was particularly difficult, in the history in which men retrace their \nown ideas and their own knowledge, to formulate a general theory of discontinuity, of series, of limits, unities, specific \norders, and differentiated autonomies and dependences.

Or, to be \nmore precise, as if we found it difficult to construct a theory, to draw general conclusions, and even to derive all the \npossible implications of these concepts of thresholds, mutations, independent systems, and limited series — in the way in \nwhich they had been used in fact by historians. As if we were afraid to conceive of the Other in the time of our own \nthought. \nThere is a reason for this. If the history of thought could remain the locus of uninterrupted continuities, if it could \nendlessly forge connexions that no analysis could undo without abstraction, if it could weave, around everything that men \nsay and do, obscure synthesis that anticipate for him, prepare him, and lead him endlessly towards his future, it would \nprovide a privileged shelter for the sovereignty of consciousness. Continuous history is the indispensable correlative of \nthe founding function of the subject: the guarantee that everything that has eluded him may be restored to him; the \ncertainty that time will disperse nothing without restoring it in a reconstituted unity; the promise that one day the subject \n— in the form of historical consciousness — will once again be able to appropriate, to bring back under his sway, all \nthose things that are kept at a distance by difference, and find in them what might be called his abode. Making historical \nanalysis the discourse of the continuous and making human consciousness the original subject of all historical \ndevelopment and all action are the two sides of the same system of thought. In this system, time is conceived \nin terms of totalization and revolutions are never more than moments of consciousness. \n \n((14)) \n \nIn various forms, this theme has played a constant role since the nineteenth century: to preserve, against all \ndecentrings, the sovereignty of the subject, and the twin figures of anthropology and humanism. Against the decentring \noperated by Marx — by the historical analysis of the relations of production, economic determinations, and the class \nstruggle — it gave place, towards the end of the nineteenth century, to the search for a total history, in which all the \ndifferences of a society might be reduced to a single form, to the organization of a world-view, to the establishment of a \nsystem of values, to a coherent type of civilization. To the decentring operated by the Nietzschean genealogy, it opposed \nthe search for an original foundation that would make rationality the telos of mankind, and link the whole history of \nthought to the preservation of this rationality, to the maintenance of this teleology, and to the ever necessary return to this \nfoundation. Lastly, more recently, when the researches of psychoanalysis, linguistics, and ethnology have decentred the \nsubject in relation to the laws of his desire, the forms of his language, the rules of his action, or the games of his mythical \nor fabulous discourse, when it became clear that man himself, questioned as to what he was, could not account for his \nsexuality and his unconscious, the systematic forms of his language, or the regularities of his fictions, the theme of a \ncontinuity of history has been reactivated once again; a history that would be not division, but development (devenir); not \nan interplay of relations, but an internal dynamic; not a system, but the hard work of freedom; not form, but the unceasing \neffort of a consciousness turned upon itself, trying to grasp itself in its deepest conditions: a history that would be both an \nact of long, uninterrupted patience and the vivacity of a movement, which, in the end, breaks all bounds. If one is to assert \nthis theme, which, to the `immobility' of structures, to their `closed' system, to their necessary `synchrony', opposes the \nliving openness of history, one must obviously deny in the historical analyses themselves the use of discontinuity, the \ndefinition of levels and limits, the description of specific series, the uncovering of the whole interplay of differences. One \nis led there-fore to anthropologize Marx, to make of him a historian of totalities, and to rediscover in him the message of \nhumanism; one is led therefore \n((15)) \nto interpret Nietzsche in the terms of transcendental philosophy, and to reduce his genealogy to the level of a search for \norigins; lastly, one is led to leave to one side, as if it had never arisen, that whole field of methodological problems that \nthe new history is now presenting. For, if it is asserted that the question of discontinuities, systems and trans-formations, \nseries and thresholds, arises in all the historical disciplines (and in those concerned with ideas or the sciences no less than \nthose concerned with economics and society), how could one oppose with any semblance of legitimacy 'development' and \n'system', move-ment and circular regulations, or, as it is sometimes put crudely and unthinkingly, 'history' and 'structure'? \nThe same conservative function is at work in the theme of cultural totalities (for which Marx has been criticized, then \ntravestied), in the theme of a search for origins (which was opposed to Nietzsche, before an attempt was made to \ntranspose him into it), and in the theme of a living, continuous, open history. The cry goes up that one is murder-ing \nhistory whenever, in a historical analysis — and especially if it is concerned with thought, ideas, or knowledge — one is \nseen to be using in too obvious a way the categories of discontinuity and difference, the notions of threshold, rupture and \n",

But one must not be deceived: what is being bewailed with such \nvehemence is not the disappearance of history, but the eclipse of that form of history that was secretly, but entirely related \nto the synthetic activity of the subject; what is being bewailed is the 'development' (devenir) that was to provide the \nsovereignty of the consciousness with a safer, less exposed shelter than myths, kinship systems, languages, sexuality, or \ndesire; what is being bewailed is the possibility of reanimating through the project, the work of meaning, or the move-\nment of totalization, the interplay of material determinations, rules of practice, unconscious systems, rigorous but \nunreflected relations, correlations that elude all lived experience; what is being bewailed, is that ideological use of history \nby which one tries to restore to man every-thing that has unceasingly eluded him for over a hundred years. All the \ntreasure of bygone days was crammed into the old citadel of this his-tory; it was thought to be secure; it was sacralized; it \nwas made the last \n((16)) \nresting-place of anthropological thought; it was even thought that its most inveterate enemies could be captured and \nturned into vigilant guardians. But the historians had long ago deserted the old fortress and gone to work elsewhere; it \nwas realized that neither Marx nor Nietzsche were carrying out the guard duties that had been entrusted to them. They \ncould not be depended on to preserve privilege; nor to affirm once and for all — and God knows it is needed in the \ndistress of today — that history, at least, is living and continuous, that it is, for the subject in question, a place of rest, \ncertainty, reconciliation, a place of tranquillized sleep. \nAt this point there emerges an enterprise of which my earlier hooks Histoire de la folie (Madness and Civilization), \nNaissance de la clinique, and Les Mots et les choses (The Order of Things)'` were a very imperfect sketch. An enterprise \nby which one tries to measure the mutations that operate in general in the field of history; an enterprise in which the \nmethods, limits, and themes proper to the history of ideas are questioned; an enterprise by which one tries to throw off \nthe last anthropological constraints; an enterprise that wishes, in return, to reveal how these constraints could come \nabout. These tasks were outlined in a rather disordered way, and their general articulation was never clearly defined. It \nwas time that they were given greater coherence — or, at least, that an attempt was made to do so. This book is the \nresult. \nIn order to avoid misunderstanding, I should like to begin with a few observations. \n—My aim is not to transfer to the field of history, and more particularly to the history of knowledge \n(connaissances),3 a structuralist \n \n((footnote)) \n \n' Madness and Civilization, New York, Random House, 1965; London, Tavistock, 1967; The Order of Things, London, Tavistock; New York, Pantheon, 1970. A \ntranslation of Naissance de la clinique was published in 1973 (Tavistock/Pantheon). \n' The English 'knowledge' translates the French 'connaissance' and 'savoir'. Connaissance refers here to a particular corpus of knowledge, a particular discipline \n— biology or economics, for example. Savoir, which is usually defined as knowledge in general, the totality of connaissnnces, is used by Foucault in an \nunderlying, rather than an overall, way. He has himself offered the following comment on his usage of the terms: \n'By connaissance I mean the relation of the subject to the object and the formal rules that govern it. Savoir refers to the conditions that are necessary in a \nparticular period for this \n((17)) \nmethod that has proved valuable in other fields of analysis. My aim is to uncover the principles and consequences of an \nautochthonous trans-formation that is taking place in the field of historical knowledge. It may well be that this \ntransformation, the problems that it raises, the tools that it uses, the concepts that emerge from it, and the results that it \nobtains are not entirely foreign to what is called structural analysis. But this kind of analysis is not specifically used; \n \n—my aim is most decidedly not to use the categories of cultural totalities (whether world-views, ideal types, the \nparticular spirit of an age) in order to impose on history, despite itself, the forms of structural analysis. The series \ndescribed, the limits fixed, the comparisons and correlations made are based not on the old philosophies of history, but \nare intended to question teleologien and totalizations; \n \n—in so far as my aim is to define a method of historical analysis freed from the anthropological theme, it is clear that the \ntheory that I am about to outline has a dual relation with the previous studies. It is an attempt to formulate, in general \nterms (and not without a great deal of rectification and elaboration), the tools that these studies have used or forged for \nthemselves in the course of their work.

But \nit would probably not be incorrect to say that the problem of structure arose there too. \nThis work is not an exact description of what can be read in Madness and Civilization, Naissance \nde la clinique, or The Order of Things. It is different on a great many points. It also includes a \nnumber of corrections and internal criticisms. Generally speaking, Madness and Civilization \naccorded far too great a place, and a very enigmatic one too, to what I called an `experiment', thus \nshowing to what extent one was still close to admitting an anonymous and general subject of history; \nin Naissance de la clinique, the frequent recourse to structural analysis threatened to bypass the \nspecificity of the problem presented, and the level proper to archaeology; lastly, in The Order of \nThings, the absence of methodological signposting may have given the impression that my analyses \nwere being conducted in terms of cultural totality. It is mortifying that I was unable to avoid these \ndangers: I console myself with the thought that they were intrinsic to the enterprise itself, since, in \norder to carry out its task, it had first to free itself from these various methods and forms of history; \nmoreover, without the questions that I was asked,' without the difficulties that arose, without the \nobjections that were made, I may never have gained so clear a view of the enterprise to which I am \nnow inextricably linked. Hence the cautious, stumbling manner of this text: at every turn, it stands \nback, measures up what is before it, gropes towards its limits, stumbles against what it does not \nmean, and digs pits to mark out its own path. At every turn, it denounces any possible confusion. It \nrejects its identity, without previously stat-ing: I am neither this nor that. It is not critical, most of the \ntime; it is not a way of saying that everyone else is wrong. It is an attempt to define a particular site \nby the exteriority of its vicinity; rather than trying to reduce others to silence, by claiming that what \nthey say is worthless, I have tried to define this blank space from which I speak, \n \n((footnote)) \n \n* In particular, the first pages of this introduction are based on a reply to questions presented by the Cercle d'Epistemologic of \nthe E.N.S.

I am no doubt not the only one who writes in order to have no \nface. Do not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same: leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to \nsee that our papers are in order. At least spare us their morality when we write.' \nPart II The Discursive Regularities \n((23)) \n \n \n1. THE UNITIES OF DISCOURSE \nThe use of concepts of discontinuity, rupture, threshold, limit, series, and transformation present all historical analysis not \nonly with questions of procedure, but with theoretical problems. It is these problems that will be studied here (the \nquestions of procedure will be examined in later empirical studies – if the opportunity, the desire, and the courage to \nundertake them do not desert me). These theoretical problems too will be examined only in a particular field: in those \ndisciplines – so unsure of their frontiers, and so vague in content – that we call the history of ideas, or of thought, or of \nscience, or of knowledge. \nBut there is a negative work to be carried out first: we must rid ourselves of a whole mass of notions, each of which, in \nits own way, diversifies the theme of continuity. They may not have a very rigorous conceptual structure, but they have a \nvery precise function. Take the notion of tradition: it is intended to give a special temporal status to a group of \nphenomena that are both successive and identical (or at least similar); it makes it possible to rethink the dispersion of \nhistory in the form of the same; it allows a reduction of the difference proper to every beginning, in order to pursue \nwithout discontinuity the endless search for the origin; tradition enables us to isolate the new against a back-ground of \npermanence, and to transfer its merit to originality, to genius, to the decisions proper to individuals. Then there is the \nnotion \n \n((24)) \nof influence, which provides a support — of too magical a kind to be very amenable to analysis — for the facts of \ntransmission and communication; which refers to an apparently causal process (but with neither rigorous delimitation \nnor theoretical definition) the phenomena of resemblance or repetition; which links, at a distance and through time — as \nif through the mediation of a medium of propagation — such defined unities as individuals, oeuvres, notions, or theories. \nThere are the notions of development and evolution: they make it possible to group a succession of dispersed events, to \nlink them to one and the same organizing principle, to subject them to the exemplary power of life (with its adaptations, \nits capacity for innovation the incessant correlation of its different elements, its systems of assimilation and exchange), \nto dis-cover, already at work in each beginning, a principle of coherence and the outline of a future unity, to master time \nthrough a perpetually reversible relation between an origin and a term that are never given, but are always at work. There \nis the notion of 'spirit', which enables us to establish between the simultaneous or successive phenomena of a given \nperiod a community of meanings, symbolic links, an interplay of resemblance and reflexion, or which allows the \nsovereignty of collective consciousness to emerge as the principle of unity and explanation. We must question those \nready-made syntheses, those groupings that we normally accept before any examination, those links whose validity is \nrecognized from the outset; we must oust those forms and obscure forces by which we usually link the discourse of one \nman with that of another; they must be driven out from the darkness in which they reign.

Can one accept, as such, \nthe distinction between the major types of discourse, or that between such forms or genres as science, literature, \nphilosophy, religion, history, fiction, etc., and which tend to create certain great historical individualities? We are not \neven sure of ourselves when we use these distinctions in our own world of discourse, let alone when we are analysing \ngroups of statements which, when first formulated, were distributed, divided, and characterized in a quite different way: \nafter all, 'literature' and 'politics' \n((25)) \nare recent categories, which can be applied to medieval culture, or even classical culture, only by a retrospective \nhypothesis, and by an interplay of formal analogies or semantic resemblances; but neither literature, nor \npolitics, nor philosophy and the sciences articulated the field of discourse, in the seventeenth or eighteenth \ncentury, as they did in the nineteenth century. In any case, these divisions — whether our own, or those \ncontemporary with the discourse under examination — are always themselves reflexive categories, principles of \nclassification, normative rules, institutionalized types: they, in turn., are facts of discourse that deserve to be \nanalysed beside others; of course, they also have complex relations with. each other, but they are not intrinsic, \nautochthonous, and. universally recognizable characteristics. \nBut the unities that must be suspended above all are those that emerge in the most immediate way: those of \nthe book and the oeuvre. At first sight, it would seem that one could not abandon these unities without extreme \nartificiality. Are they not given in the most definite way? There is the material individualization of the book, \nwhich occupies a determined space, which has an. economic value, and which itself indicates, by a number of \nsigns, the limits of its beginning and its end; and there is the establishment of an oeuvre, which we recognize \nand delimit by attributing a certain number of texts to an author. And yet as soon as one looks at the matter a \nlittle more closely the difficulties begin. The material unity of the book? Is this the same in the case of an \nanthology of poems, a collection of posthumous fragments, Desargues' Traite des Coniques, or a volume of \nMichelet's Histoire de France? Is it the same in the case of Mallarme's Un Coup de des, the trial of Gilles de Rais, \nButor's San Marco, or a Catholic missal? In other words, is not the material unity of the volume a weak, \naccessory unity in relation to the discursive unity of which it is the support? But is this discursive unity itself \nhomogeneous and uniformly applicable? A novel by Stendhal and a novel by Dostoevsky do not have the same \nrelation. of individuality as that between two novels belonging to Balzac's cycle La Comedic humaine; and the \nrelation between Balzac's novels is not the same as that existing between Joyce's Ulysses and the Odyssey. The \nfrontiers of a book are never clear-cut: beyond the title, the first lines, and the last full stop, beyond its internal \nconfiguration and its autonomous form, it is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, \nother sentences: it is a \n((26)) \nnode within a network. And this network of references is not the same in the case of a mathematical treatise, a textual \ncommentary, a historical account, and an episode in a novel cycle; the unity of the book, even in the sense of a group of \nrelations, cannot be regarded as identical in each case. The book is not simply the object that one holds in one's hands; \nand it cannot remain within the little parallelepiped that contains it: its unity is variable and relative. As soon as one \nquestions that unity, it loses its self-evidence; it indicates itself, constructs itself, only on the basis of a complex field of \ndiscourse. \nThe problems raised by the oeuvre are even more difficult. Yet, at first sight, what could be more simple? A \ncollection of texts that can be designated by the sign of a proper name. But this designation (even leaving to one side \nproblems of attribution) is not a homogeneous function: does the name of an author designate in the same way a text that \nhe has published under his name, a text that he has presented under a pseudonym, another found after his death in the \nform of an unfinished draft, and another that is merely a collection of jottings, a notebook? The establishment of a \ncomplete oeuvre presupposes a number of choices that are difficult to justify or even to formulate: is it enough to add to \nthe texts published by the author those that he intended for publication but which remained unfinished by the fact of his \ndeath? Should one also include all his sketches and first drafts, with all their corrections and crossings out? Should one \nadd sketches that he himself abandoned? And what status should be given to letters, notes, reported conversations, \ntranscriptions of what he said made by those present at the time, in short, to that vast mass of verbal traces left by an \nindividual at his death, and which speak in an endless confusion so many different languages (Iangages)?'

Where the meaning would otherwise be unclear, I have added the original French \nword in brackets. (Te) \n((27)) \nautobiographies, the scholastic dissertations, the philological articles, Zarathustra, Ecce Homo, the letters, the last \npostcards signed 'Dionysos' or 'Kaiser Nietzsche', and the innumerable notebooks with their jumble of laundry bills and \nsketches for aphorisms. In fact, if one speaks so undiscriminately and unreflectingly of an author's oeuvre, it is because \none imagines it to be defined by a certain expressive function. One is admitting that there must be a level (as deep as it is \nnecessary to imagine it) at which the oeuvre emerges, in all its fragments, even the smallest, most inessential ones, as the \nexpression of the thought, the experience, the imagination, or the unconscious of the author, or, indeed, of the historical \ndeterminations that operated upon him. But it is at once apparent that such a unity, far from being given immediately, is \nthe result of an operation; that this operation is interpretative (since it deciphers, in the text, the transcription of something \nthat it both conceals and manifests); and that the operation that determines the opus, in its unity, and consequently the \noeuvre itself, will not be the same in the case of the author of Le Theatre et son Double (Artaud) and the author of the \nTractatus (Wittgenstein), and therefore when one speaks of an oeuvre in each case one is using the word in a different \nsense. The oeuvre can be regarded neither as an immediate unity, nor as a certain unity, nor as a homogeneous unity. \nOne last precaution must be taken to disconnect the unquestioned continuities by which we organize, in advance, the \ndiscourse that we are to analyse: we must renounce two linked, but opposite themes. The first involves a wish that it \nshould never be possible to assign, in the order of discourse, the irruption of a real event; that beyond any apparent \nbeginning, there is always a secret origin — so secret and so fundamental that it can never be quite grasped in itself. Thus \none is led inevitably, through the naivety of chronologies, towards an ever-receding point that is never itself present in \nany history; this point is merely its own void; and from that point all beginnings can never be more than \nrecommencements or occultation (in one and the same gesture, this and that). To this theme is connected another \naccording to which all manifest discourse is secretly based on an 'already-said'; and that this 'already-said' is not merely a \nphrase that has already been spoken, or a text that has already been written, but a 'never-said', an incorporeal discourse, a \nvoice as silent as a breath, a writing that is \n((28)) \nmerely the hollow of its own mark. It is supposed therefore that every-thing that is formulated in discourse was already \narticulated in that semi-silence that precedes it, which continues to run obstinately beneath it, but which it covers and \nsilences. The manifest discourse, therefore, is really no more than the repressive presence of what it does not say; and this \n'not-said' is a hollow that undermines from within all that is said. The first theme sees the historical analysis of discourse \nas the quest for and the repetition of an origin that eludes all historical determination; the second sees it as the \ninterpretation of 'hearing' of an 'already-said' that is at the same time a 'not-said'. We must renounce all those themes \nwhose function is to ensure the infinite continuity of discourse and its secret presence to itself in the interplay of a \nconstantly recurring absence. We must be ready to receive every moment of discourse in its sudden irruption; in that \npunctuality in which it appears, and in that temporal dispersion that enables it to be repeated, known, forgotten, \ntransformed, utterly erased, and hidden, far from all view, in the dust of books. Discourse must not be referred to the \ndistant presence of the origin, but treated as and when it occurs. \nThese pre-existing forms of continuity, all these syntheses that are accepted without question, must remain in \nsuspense. They must not be rejected definitively of course, but the tranquillity with which they are accepted must be \ndisturbed; we must show that they do not come about of themselves, but are always the result of a construction the rules \nof which must be known, and the justifications of which must be scrutinized: we must define in what conditions and in \nview of which analyses certain of them are legitimate; and we must indicate which of them can never be accepted in any \ncircumstances. It may be, for example, that the notions of 'influence' or 'evolution' belong to a criticism that puts them — \nfor the foreseeable future — out of use. But need we dispense for ever with the 'oeuvre', the 'book', or even such unities as \n'science' or 'literature'? Should we regard them as illusions, illegitimate constructions, or ill-acquired results? Should we \nnever make use of them, even as a temporary support, and never provide them with a definition?

How can they be defined or limited? What distinct \ntypes of laws can they obey? What articulation are they capable of? What sub-groups can they give rise to? What specific \nphenomena do they reveal in the field of discourse?) We must recognize that they may not, in the last resort, be what they \nseem at first sight. In short, that they require a theory, and that this theory can-not be constructed unless the field of the \nfacts of discourse on the basis of which those facts are built up appears in its non-synthetic purity. \nAnd I, in turn, will do no more than this: of course, I shall take as my starting-point whatever unities are already given \n(such as psycho-pathology, medicine, or political economy) ; but I shall not place myself inside these dubious unities in \norder to study their internal configuration or their secret contradictions. I shall make use of them just long enough to ask \nmyself what unities they form; by what right they can claim a field that specifies them in space and a continuity that indi-\nvidualizes them in time; according to what laws they are formed; against the background of which discursive events they \nstand out; and whether they are not, in their accepted and quasi-institutional individuality, ultimately the surface effect of \nmore firmly grounded unities. I shall accept the groupings that history suggests only to subject them at once to \ninterrogation; to break them up and then to see whether they can be legitimately reformed; or whether other groupings \nshould be made; to replace them in a more general space which, while dissipating their apparent familiarity, makes it \npossible to construct a theory of them. \nOnce these immediate forms of continuity are suspended, an entire field is set free. A vast field, but one that can be \ndefined nonetheless: this field is made up of the totality of all effective statements (whether spoken or written), in their \ndispersion as events and in the occurrence that is proper to them. Before approaching, with any degree of certainty, a \nscience, or novels, or political speeches, or the oeuvre of an author, or even a single book, the material with which one is \ndealing is, in its raw, neutral state, a population of events in the space of discourse in general. One is led therefore to the \nproject of a pure description of discursive events as the horizon for the search for the unities that form \n((30)) \nwithin it. This description is easily distinguishable from an analysis of the language. Of course, a linguistic system can be \nestablished (unless it is constructed artificially) only by using a corpus of statements, or a collection of discursive facts; \nbut we must then define, on the basis of this grouping, which has value as a sample, rules that may make it possible to \nconstruct other statements than these: even if it has long since disappeared, even if it is no longer spoken, and can be \nreconstructed only on the basis of rare fragments, a language (longue) is still a system for possible statements, a finite \nbody of rules that authorizes an infinite number of performances. The field of discursive events, on the other hand, is a \ngrouping that is always finite and limited at any moment to the linguistic sequences that have been formulated; they may \nbe innumerable, they may, in sheer size, exceed the capacities of recording, memory, or reading: nevertheless they form a \nfinite group-ing. The question posed by language analysis of some discursive fact or other is always: according to what \nrules has a particular statement been made, and consequently according to what rules could other similar statements be \nmade? The description of the events of discourse poses a quite different question: how is it that one particular statement \nappeared rather than another? \nIt is also clear that this description of discourses is in opposition to the history of thought. There too a system of \nthought can be reconstituted only on the basis of a definite discursive totality. But this totality is treated in such a way that \none tries to rediscover beyond the statements themselves the intention of the speaking subject, his conscious activity, \nwhat he meant, or, again, the unconscious activity that took place, despite himself, in what he said or in the almost \nimperceptible fracture of his actual words; in any case, we must reconstitute another discourse, rediscover the silent \nmurmuring, the inexhaustible speech that animates from within the voice that one hears, re-establish the tiny, invisible \ntext that runs between and sometimes collides with them. The analysis of thought is always allegorical in relation to the \ndiscourse that it employs. Its question is unfailingly: what was being said in what was said? The analysis of the discursive \nfield is orientated in a quite different way; we must grasp the statement in the exact specificity of its occurrence; \ndetermine its conditions of existence, fix at least its limits, establish its correlations with other statements that \n \n((31)) \nmay be connected with it, and show what other forms of statement it excludes. We do not seek below what is manifest the \nhalf silent murmur of another discourse; we must show why it could not be other than it was, in what respect it is \nexclusive of any other, how it assumes, in the midst of others and in relation to them, a place that no other could occupy. \nThe question proper to such an analysis might be formulated in this way: what is this specific existence that emerges from \nwhat is said and nowhere else? \nWe must ask ourselves what purpose is ultimately served by this suspension of all the accepted unities, if, in the end, \nwe return to the unities that we pretended to question at the outset. In fact, the systematic erasure of all given unities \nenables us first of all to restore to the statement the specificity of its occurrence, and to show that discontinuity is one of \nthose great accidents that create cracks not only in the geology of history, but also in the simple fact of the statement; it \nemerges in its historical irruption; what we try to examine is the incision that it makes, that irreducible — and very often \ntiny — emergence.

It is certainly a strange \nevent: first, because on the one hand it is linked to the gesture of writing or to the articulation of speech, and also on the \nother hand it opens up to itself a residual existence in the field of a memory, or in the materiality of manuscripts, books, \nor any other form of recording; secondly, because, like every event, it is unique, yet subject to repetition, transformation, \nand reactivation; thirdly, because it is linked not only to the situations that provoke it, and to the consequences that it \ngives rise to, but at the same time, and in accordance with a quite different modality, to the statements that precede and \nfollow it. \nBut if we isolate, in relation to the language and to thought, the occurrence of the statement/event, it is not in order to \nspread over everything a dust of facts. It is in order to be sure that this occurrence is not linked with synthesizing \noperations of a purely psychological kind (the intention of the author, the form of his mind, the rigour of his thought, the \nthemes that obsess him, the project that traverses his \n \n \n((32)) \nexistence and gives it meaning) and to be able to grasp other forms of regularity, other types of relations. Relations \nbetween statements (even if the author is unaware of them; even if the statements do not have the same author; even \nif the authors were unaware of each other's existence) ; relations between groups of statements thus established \n(even if these groups do not concern the same, or even adjacent, fields; even if they do not possess the same formal \nlevel; even if they are not the locus of assignable exchanges); relations between statements and groups of \nstatements and events of a quite different kind (technical, economic, social, political). To reveal in all its purity the \nspace in which discursive events are deployed is not to undertake to re-establish it in an isolation that nothing could \novercome; it is not to close it upon itself; it is to leave oneself free to describe the interplay of relations within it and \noutside it. \nThe third purpose of such a description of the facts of discourse is that by freeing them of all the groupings that \npurport to be natural, immediate, universal unities, one is able to describe other unities, but this time by means of a \ngroup of controlled decisions. Providing one defines the conditions clearly, it might be legitimate to constitute, on \nthe basis of correctly described relations, discursive groups that are not arbitrary, and yet remain invisible. Of \ncourse, these relations would never be formulated for themselves in the statements in question (unlike, for example, \nthose explicit relations that are posed and spoken in discourse itself, as in the form of the novel, or a series of \nmathematical theorems). But in no way would they constitute a sort of secret discourse, animating the manifest \ndiscourse from within; it is not therefore an interpretation of the facts of the statement that might reveal them, but \nthe analysis of their coexistence, their succession, their mutual functioning, their reciprocal determination, and their \nindependent or correlative transformation. \nHowever, it is not possible to describe all the relations that may emerge in this way without some guide-lines. A \nprovisional division must be adopted as an initial approximation: an initial region that analysis will subsequently \ndemolish and, if necessary, reorganize. But how is such a region to be circumscribed? On the one hand, we must \nchoose, empirically, a field in which the relations are likely to be numerous, dense, and relatively easy to describe: \nand in what other \n((33)) \nregion do discursive events appear to be more closely linked to one another, to occur in accordance with more easily \ndecipherable relations, than in the region usually known as science? But, on the other hand, what better way of grasping \nin a statement, not the moment of its formal structure and laws of construction, but that of its existence and the rules that \ngovern its appearance, if not by dealing with relatively unformalized groups of discourses, in which the statements do \nnot seem necessarily to be built on the rules of pure syntax? How can we be sure of avoiding such divisions as the \ncruvre, or such categories as 'influence', unless, from the very outset, we adopt sufficiently broad fields and scales that \nare chronologically vast enough? Lastly, how can we be sure that we will not find ourselves in the grip of all those over-\nhasty unities or syntheses concerning the speaking subject, or the author of the text, in short, all anthropological \ncategories? Unless, perhaps, we consider all the statements out of which these categories are constituted — all the \nstatements that have chosen the subject of discourse (their own subject) as their 'object' and have undertaken to deploy it \nas their field of knowledge? \nThis explains the de facto privilege that I have accorded to those dis-courses that, to put it very schematically, define \nthe 'sciences of man'. But it is only a provisional privilege. Two facts must be constantly borne in mind: that the analysis \nof discursive events is in no way limited to such a field; and that the division of this field itself cannot be regarded either \n",

DISCURSIVE FORMATIONS \nI have undertaken, then, to describe the relations between statements. I have been careful to accept as valid none of the \nunities that would normally present themselves to anyone embarking on such a task. I have decided to ignore no form of \ndiscontinuity, break, threshold, or limit. I have decided to describe statements in the field of discourse and the relations of \nwhich they are capable. As I see it, two series of problems arise at the outset: the first, which I shall leave to one side for \nthe time being and shall return to later, concerns the indiscriminate use that I have made of the terms statement, event, \nand discourse; the second concerns the relations that may legitimately he described between the statements that have been \nleft in their provisional, visible grouping. \nThere are statements, for example, that are quite obviously concerned — and have been from a date that is easy \nenough to determine — with political economy, or biology, or psychopathology; there are others that equally obviously \nbelong to those age-old continuities known as grammar or medicine. But what are these unities? How can we say that the \nanalysis of headaches carried out by Willis or Charcot belong to the same order of discourse? That Petty's inventions are \nin continuity with Neumann's econometry? That the analysis of judge-ment by the Port-Royal grammarians belongs to the \nsame domain as \n((35)) \nthe discovery of vowel gradations in the Indo-European languages? What, in fact, are medicine, grammar, or political \neconomy? Are they merely a retrospective regrouping by which the contemporary sciences deceive themselves as to their \nown past? Are they forms that have become established once and for all and have gone on developing through time? Do \nthey conceal other unities? And what sort of links can validly be recognized between all these statements that form, in \nsuch a familiar and insistent way, such an enigmatic mass? \nFirst hypothesis — and the one that, at first sight, struck me as being the most likely and the most easily proved: \nstatements different in form, and dispersed in time, form a group if they refer to one and the same object. Thus, \nstatements belonging to psychopathology all seem to refer to an object that emerges in various ways in individual or \nsocial experience and which may be called madness. But I soon realized that the unity of the object 'madness' does not \nenable one to individualize a group of statements, and to establish between them a relation that is both constant and \ndescribable. There are two reasons for this. It would certainly be a mistake to try to discover what could have been said of \nmadness at a particular time by interrogating the being of madness itself, its secret content, its silent, self-enclosed truth; \nmental illness was constituted by all that was said in all the statements that named it, divided it up, described it, explained \nit, traced its developments, indicated its various correlations, judged it, and possibly gave it speech by articulating, in its \nname, discourses that were to be taken as its own. Moreover, this group of statements is far from referring to a single \nobject, formed once and for all, and to preserving it indefinitely as its horizon of inexhaustible ideality; the object \npresented as their correlative by medical statements of the seventeenth or eighteenth century is not identical with the \nobject that emerges in legal sentences or police action; similarly, all the objects of psychopathological discourses were \nmodified from Pinel or Esquirol to Bleuler: it is not the same illnesses that are at issue in each of these cases; we are not \ndealing with the same madmen. \nOne might, perhaps one should, conclude from this multiplicity of objects that it is not possible to accept, as a valid \nunity forming a group of statements, a 'discourse, concerning madness'. Perhaps one should confine one's attention to \nthose groups of statements that have one and \n \n \n((36)) \nthe same object: the discourses on melancholia, or neurosis, for example. But one would soon realize that each of these \ndiscourses in turn constituted its object and worked it to the point of transforming it altogether. So that the problem arises \nof knowing whether the unity of a discourse is based not so much on the permanence and uniqueness of an object as on \nthe space in which various objects emerge and are continuously transformed. Would not the typical relation that would \nenable us to individualize a group of statements concerning madness then be: the rule of simultaneous or successive \n",

The unity of \ndiscourses on madness would not be based upon the existence of the object 'madness', or the constitution of a single \nhorizon of objectivity; it would be the interplay of the rules that make possible the appearance of objects during a given \nperiod of time: objects that are shaped by measures of discrimination and repression, objects that are differentiated in \ndaily practice, in law, in religious casuistry, in medical diagnosis, objects that are manifested in pathological descriptions, \nobjects that are circumscribed by medical codes, practices, treatment, and care. Moreover, the unity of the discourses on \nmadness would be the interplay of the rules that define the transformations of these different objects, their non-identity \nthrough time, the break produced in them, the internal discontinuity that suspends their permanence. Paradoxically, to \ndefine a group of statements in terms of its individuality would be to define the dispersion of these objects, to grasp all \nthe interstices that separate them, to measure the distances that reign between them — in other words, to formulate their \nlaw of division. \nSecond hypothesis to define a group of relations between statements: their form and type of connexion. It seemed to \nme, for example, that from the nineteenth century, medical science was characterized not so much by its objects or \nconcepts as by a certain style, a certain constant manner of statement.

    "chunk_full": "perceived in what one said (same vocabulary, same play of metaphor); in short, it seemed to me that medicine was \norganized as a series of descriptive statements. But, there again, I had to abandon this hypothesis at the outset and \nrecognize that clinical discourse was just as much a group of hypotheses about life and death, of ethical choices, of thera-\npeutic decisions, of institutional regulations, of teaching models, as a group of descriptions; that the descriptions could \nnot, in any case, be abstracted from the hypotheses, and that the descriptive statement was only one of the formulations \npresent in medical discourse. I also had to recognize that this description has constantly been displaced: either because, \nfrom Bichat to cell pathology, the scales and guide-lines have been displaced; or because from visual inspection, \nauscultation and palpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests, the information system has been modified; or, \nagain, because, from simple anatomoclinical correlation to the delicate analysis of physiopathological processes, the \nlexicon of signs and their decipherment has been entirely reconstituted; or, finally, because the doctor has gradually \nceased to be himself the locus of the registering and interpretation of information, and because, beside him, outside him, \nthere have appeared masses of documentation, instruments of correlation, and techniques of analysis, which, of course, he \nmakes use of, but which modify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient. \nAll these alterations, which may now lead to the threshold of a new medicine, gradually appeared in medical discourse \nthroughout the nineteenth century. If one wished to define this discourse by a codified and normative system of statement, \none would have to recognize that this medicine disintegrated as soon as it appeared and that it really found its formulation \nonly in Bichat and Laennec. If there is a unity, its principle is not therefore a determined form of statements; is it not \nrather the group of rules, which, simultaneously or in turn, have made possible purely perceptual descriptions, together \nwith observations mediated through instruments, the procedures used in laboratory experiments, statistical calculations, \nepidemiological or demographic observations, institutional regulations, and therapeutic practice? What one must \ncharacterize and individualize is the coexistence of these dispersed and heterogeneous statements; the system that governs \ntheir division, the degree to which they depend upon one another, the way \n((38)) \nin which they interlock or exclude one another, the transformation that they undergo, and the play of their location, \narrangement, and replacement. \nAnother direction of research, another hypothesis: might it not be possible to establish groups of statements, by \ndetermining the system of permanent and coherent concepts involved? For example, does not the Classical analysis of \nlanguage and grammatical facts (from Lancelot to the end of the eighteenth century) rest on a definite number of concepts \nwhose content and usage had been established once and for all: the concept of judgement defined as the general, \nnormative form of any sentence, the concepts of subject and predicate regrouped under the more general category of \nnoun, the concept of verb used as the equivalent of that of logical copula, the concept of word defined as the sign of a \nrepresentation, etc.? In this way, one might reconstitute the conceptual architecture of Classical grammar. But there too \none would soon come up against limitations: no sooner would one have succeeded in describing with such elements the \nanalyses carried out by the Port-Royal authors than one would no doubt be forced to acknowledge the appearance of new \nconcepts; some of these may be derived from the first, but the others are heterogeneous and a few even incompatible with \nthem. The notion of natural or inverted syntactical order, that of complement (introduced in the eighteenth century by \nBeauzee), may still no doubt be integrated into the conceptual system of the Port-Royal grammar. But neither the idea of \nan originally expressive value of sounds, nor that of a primitive body of knowledge enveloped in words and conveyed in \nsome obscure way by them, nor that of regularity in the mutation of consonants, nor the notion of the verb as a mere \nname capable of designating an action or operation, is compatible with the group of concepts used by Lancelot or Duclos. \nMust we admit therefore that grammar only appears to form a coherent figure; and that this group of statements, analyses, \ndescriptions, principles and con-sequences, deductions that has been perpetrated under this name for over a century is no \nmore than a false unity? But perhaps one might discover a discursive unity if one sought it not in the coherence of \nconcepts, but in their simultaneous or successive emergence, in the distance that separates them and even in their \nincompatibility. One would no longer seek an architecture of concepts sufficiently general \n((39)) \nand abstract to embrace all others and to introduce them into the same deductive structure; one would try to analyse the \ninterplay of their appearances and dispersion. \nLastly, a fourth hypothesis to regroup the statements, describe their interconnexion and account for the unitary forms \nunder which they are presented: the identity and. persistence of themes. In 'sciences' like economics or biology, which are \nso controversial in character, so open to philosophical or ethical options, so exposed in certain cases to political \nmanipulation, it is legitimate in the first instance to suppose that a certain thematic is capable of linking, and animating a \ngroup of dis-courses, like an organism with its own needs, its own internal force, and its own capacity for survival.

    "chunk_full": "one not, for example, constitute as a unity everything that has constituted the evolutionist theme from Buffon to Darwin? \nA theme that in the first instance was more philosophical, closer to cosmology than to biology; a theme that directed \nresearch from afar rather than named, regrouped, and explained results; a theme that always presupposed more than one \nwas aware of, but which, on the basis of this fundamental choice, forcibly trans-formed into discursive knowledge what \nhad been outlined as a hypothesis or as a necessity. Could one not speak of the Physiocratic theme in the same way? An \nidea that postulated, beyond all demonstration and prior to all analysis, the natural character of the three ground rents; \nwhich consequently presupposed the economic and political primacy of agrarian property; which excluded all analysis of \nthe mechanisms of industrial production; which implied, on the other hand, the description of the circulation of money \nwithin a state, of its distribution between different social categories, and of the channels by which it flowed back into \nproduction; which finally led Ricardo to consider those cases in which this triple rent did not appear, the conditions in \nwhich it could form, and consequently to denounce the arbitrariness of the Physiocratic theme? \nBut on the basis of such an attempt, one is led to make two inverse and complementary observations. In one case, the \nsame thematic is articulated on the basis of two sets of concepts, two types of analysis, two perfectly different fields of \nobjects: in its most general formula-tion, the evolutionist idea is perhaps the same in the work of Benoit de Maillet, \nBorden or Diderot, and in that of Darwin; but, in fact, what \n \n((40)) \nmakes it possible and coherent is not at all the same thing in either case. In the eighteenth century, the evolutionist idea is \ndefined on the basis of a kinship of species forming a continuum laid down at the outset (interrupted only by natural \ncatastrophes) or gradually built up by the passing of time. In the nineteenth century the evolutionist theme concerns not so \nmuch the constitution of a continuous table of species, as the description of discontinuous groups and the analysis of the \nmodes of interaction between an organism whose elements are interdependent and an environment that provides its real \nconditions of life. A single theme, but based on two types of discourse. In the case of Physiocracy, on the other hand, \nQuesnay's choice rests exactly on the same system of concepts as the opposite opinion held by those that might be called \nutilitarists. At this period the analysis of wealth involved a relatively limited set of concepts that was accepted by all \n(coinage was given the same definition; prices were given the same explanation; and labour costs were calculated in the \nsame way). But, on the basis of this single set of concepts, there were two ways of explaining the formation of value, \naccording to whether it was analysed on the basis of exchange, or on that of remuneration for the day's work. These two \npossibilities contained within economic theory, and in the rules of its set of concepts, resulted, on the basis of the same \nelements, in two different options. \nIt would probably be wrong therefore to seek in the existence of these themes the principles of the individualization of \na discourse. Should they not be sought rather in the dispersion of the points of choice that the discourse leaves free? In the \ndifferent possibilities that it opens of reanimating already existing themes, of arousing opposed strategies, of giving way \nto irreconcilable interests, of making it possible, with a particular set of concepts, to play different games? Rather than \nseeking the permanence of themes, images, and opinions through time, rather than retracing the dialectic of their conflicts \nin order to individualize groups of statements, could one not rather mark out the dispersion of the points of choice, and \ndefine prior to any option, to any thematic preference, a field of strategic possibilities? \nI am presented therefore with four attempts, four failures — and four successive hypotheses. They must now be put to \nthe test. Concerning those large groups of statements with which we are so familiar — and \n \n((41)) \nwhich we call medicine, economics, or grammar — I have asked myself on what their unity could be based. On a full, \ntightly packed, continuous, geographically well-defined field of objects? What appeared to me were rather series full of \ngaps, intertwined with one another, interplays of differences, distances, substitutions, transformations. On a definite, \nnormative type of statement? I found formulations of levels that were much too different and functions that were much \ntoo heterogeneous to be linked together and arranged in a single figure, and to simulate, from one period to another, \nbeyond individual oeuvres, a sort of great uninterrupted text. On a well-defined alphabet of notions? One is con-fronted \nwith concepts that differ in structure and in the rules govern-ing their use, which ignore or exclude one another, and \nwhich cannot enter the unity of a logical architecture. On the permanence of a thematic? What one finds are rather \nvarious strategic possibilities that permit the activation of incompatible themes, or, again, the establishment of the same \ntheme in different groups of statement. Hence the idea of describing these dispersions themselves; of discovering \nwhether, between these elements, which are certainly not organized as a progressively deductive structure, nor as an \nenormous book that is being gradually and continuously written, nor as the oeuvre of a collective subject, one cannot \ndiscern a regularity: an order in their successive appearance, correlations in their simultaneity, assignable positions in a \ncommon space, a reciprocal functioning, linked and hierarchized trans-formations. Such an analysis would not try to \nisolate small islands of coherence in order to describe their internal structure; it would not try to suspect and to reveal \nlatent conflicts; it would study forms of div-ision.

The conditions to which the elements of \nthis division (objects, mode of statement, concepts, thematic choices) are subjected we shall call the rules of formation. \nThe rules of formation are conditions of existence (but also of coexistence, maintenance, modification, and \ndisappearance) in a given discursive division. \nThis, then, is the field to be covered; these the notions that we must put to the test and the analyses that we must carry \nout. I am well aware that the risks are considerable. For an initial probe, I made use of certain fairly loose, but familiar, \ngroups of statement: I have no proof that I shall find them again at the end of the analysis, nor that I shall discover the \nprinciple of their delimitation and individualization; I am not sure that the discursive formations that I shall isolate will \ndefine medicine in its overall unity, or economics and grammar in the overall curve of their historical destination; they \nmay even introduce unexpected boundaries and divisions. Similarly, I have no proof that such a description will be able \nto take account of the scientificity (or non-scientificity) of the discursive groups that I have taken as an attack point and \nwhich presented themselves at the outset with a certain pretension to scientific rationality; I have no proof that my \nanalysis will not be situated at a quite different level, constituting a description that is irreducible to epistemology or to \nthe history of the sciences. More-over, at the end of such an enterprise, one may not recover those unities that, out of \nmethodological rigour, one initially held in suspense: one may be compelled to dissociate certain euvres, ignore \ninfluences and traditions, abandon definitively the question of origin, allow the commanding presence of authors to fade \ninto the background; and thus everything that was thought to be proper to the history of ideas may disappear from view. \nThe danger, in short, is that instead of providing a basis for what already exists, instead of going over with bold strokes \nlines that have already been sketched, instead of finding reassurance in this return and final confirmation, instead of \ncompleting the blessed circle that announces, after innumerable stratagems and as many nights, that all is saved, one is \nforced to advance beyond familiar territory, far from the certainties to which one is accustomed, towards an as yet \nuncharted land and unforeseeable conclusion. Is there not a danger that everything that has so far protected the historian \nin his daily \n \n \n((43)) \njourney and accompanied him until nightfall (the destiny of rationality and the teleology of the sciences, the long, \ncontinuous labour of thought from period to period, the awakening and the progress of consciousness, its perpetual \nresumption of itself, the uncompleted, but uninterrupted movement of totalizations, the return to an ever-open source, and \nfinally the historico-transcendental thematic) may disappear, leaving for analysis a blank, indifferent space, lacking in \nboth interiority and promise? \n \n((44)) \n3.

    "chunk_full": "are enough signs to indicate it, but let us take just two of these: the establishment at the beginning of the century of a new \nmode of exclusion and confinement of the madman in a psychiatric hospital; and the possibility of tracing certain present-\nday notions back to Esquirol, Heinroth, or Pinel (paranoia can be traced back to monomania, the intelligence quotient to \nthe initial notion of imbecility, general paralysis to chronic encephalitis, character neurosis to non-delirious madness); \nwhereas if we try to trace the development of psycho-pathology beyond the nineteenth century, we soon lose our way, the \npath becomes confused, and the projection of Du Laurens or even Van Swieten on the pathology of Kraepelin or Bleuler \nprovides no more than chance coincidences. The objects with which psychopathology has dealt since this break in time \nare very numerous, mostly very new, but also very precarious, subject to change and, in some cases, to rapid \n((45)) \ndisappearance: in addition to motor disturbances, hallucinations, and speech disorders (which were already regarded as \nmanifestations of madness, although they were recognized, delimited, described, and analysed in a different way), \nobjects appeared that belonged to hitherto unused registers: minor behavioural disorders, sexual aberrations and \ndisturbances, the phenomena of suggestion and hypnosis, lesions of the central nervous system, deficiencies of \nintellectual or motor adaptation, criminality. And on the basis of each of these registers a variety of objects were named, \ncircumstances scribed, analysed, then rectified, re-defined, challenged, erased. Is it possible to lay down the rule to \nwhich their appearance was subject? Is it possible to discover according to which non-deductive system these objects \ncould be juxtaposed and placed in succession to form the fragmented field — showing at certain points great gaps, at \nothers a plethora of information — of psychopathology? What has ruled their existence as objects of discourse? \n \n(a) First we must map the first surfaces of their emergence: show where these individual differences, which, \naccording to the degrees of rationalization, conceptual codes, and types of theory, will be accorded the status of disease, \nalienation, anomaly, dementia, neurosis or psychosis, degeneration, etc., may emerge, and then be designated and \nanalysed. These surfaces of emergence are not the same for different societies, at different periods, and in different \nforms of discourse. In the case of nineteenth-century psychopathology, they were probably constituted by the family, the \nimmediate social group, the work situation, the religious community (which are all normative, which are all susceptible \nto deviation, which all have a margin of tolerance and a threshold beyond which exclusion is demanded, which all have \na mode of designation and a mode of rejecting madness, which all transfer to medicine if not the responsibility for \ntreatment and cure, at least the burden of explanation); although organized according to a specific mode, these surfaces \nof emergence were not new in the nineteenth century. On the other hand, it was no doubt at this period that new surfaces \nof appearance began to function: art with its own normativity, sexuality (its deviations in relation to customary \nprohibitions become for the first time an object of observation, description, and analysis for psychiatric \n \n \n((46)) \ndiscourse), penality (whereas in previous periods madness was care-fully distinguished from criminal conduct and was \nregarded as an excuse, criminality itself becomes — and subsequent to the celebrated `homicidal monomanias' — a form \nof deviance more or less related to madness). In these fields of initial differentiation, in the distances, the discontinuities, \nand the thresholds that appear within it, psychiatric discourse finds a way of limiting its domain, of defining what it is \ntalking about, of giving it the status of an object — and therefore of making it manifest, nameable, and describable. \n \n\u001fb)We must also describe the authorities of delimitation: in the nineteenth century, medicine (as an institution \npossessing its own rules, as a group of individuals constituting the medical profession, as a body of knowledge and \npractice, as an authority recognized by public opinion, the law, and government) became the major authority in \nsociety that delimited, designated, named, and established madness as an object; but it was not alone in this: the law \nand penal law in particular (with the definitions of excuse, non-responsibility, extenuating circumstances, and with \nthe application of such. notions as the crime passionel, heredity, danger to society), the religious authority (in so far \nas it set itself up as the authority that divided the mystical from the pathological, the spiritual from the corporeal, the \nsupernatural from the abnormal, and in so far as it practised the direction of conscience with a view to understanding \nindividuals rather than carrying out a casuistical classification of actions and circumstances), literary and art criticism \n(which in the nineteenth century treated the work less and less as an object of taste that had to be judged, and more \nand more as a language that had to be interpreted and in which the author's tricks of expression had to be recognized). \n\u001fc)Lastly, we must analyse the grids of specification: these are the systems according to which the different \n`kinds of madness' are divided, contrasted, related, regrouped, classified, derived from one another as objects of \npsychiatric discourse (in the nineteenth century, these grids of differentiation were: the soul, as a group of \nhierarchized, related, and more or less interpenetrable faculties; the body, as a three-dimensional volume of organs \n",

And for two reasons. These planes of emergence, authorities of \ndelimitation, or forms of specification do not provide objects, fully formed and armed, that the discourse of \npsychopathology has then merely to list, classify, name, select, and cover with a network of words and sentences: it is not \nthe families — with their norms, their prohibitions, their sensitivity thresh-olds — that decide who is mad, and present the \n'patients' to the psychiatrists for analysis and judgement; it is not the legal system itself that hands over certain criminals \nto psychiatry, that sees paranoia beyond a particular murder, or a neurosis behind a sexual offence. It would be quite \nwrong to see discourse as a place where previously established objects are laid one after another like words on a page. \nBut the above enumeration is inadequate for a second reason. It has located, one after another, several planes of \ndifferentiation in which the objects of dis-course may appear. But what relations exist between them? Why this \nenumeration rather than another? What defined and closed group does one imagine one is circumscribing in this way? \nAnd how can one speak of a 'system of formation' if one knows only a series of different, heterogeneous determinations, \nlacking attributable links and relations? \nIn fact, these two series of questions refer back to the same point. In order to locate that point, let us re-examine the \nprevious example. In the sphere with which psychopathology dealt in the nineteenth century, one sees the very early \nappearance (as early as Esquirol) of a whole series of objects belonging to the category of delinquency: homicide (and \nsuicide), crimes passionels, sexual offences, certain forms of theft, vagrancy — and then, through them, heredity, the \nneurogenic environment, aggressive or self-punishing behaviour, perversions, criminal impulses, suggestibility, etc. It \nwould be inadequate to say that one was dealing here with the consequences of a discovery: of the sudden discovery by a \npsychiatrist of a resemblance between criminal and pathological behaviour, a discovery of the presence in certain \n \n \n((48)) \ndelinquents of the classical signs of alienation, or mental derangement. Such facts lie beyond the grasp of contemporary \nresearch: indeed, the problem is how to decide what made them possible, and how these 'discoveries' could lead to others \nthat took them up, rectified them, modified them, or even disproved them. Similarly, it would he irrelevant to attribute the \nappearance of these new objects to the norms of nineteenth-century bourgeois society, to a reinforced police and penal \nframework, to the establishment of a new code of criminal justice, to the introduction and use of extenuating \ncircumstances, to the increase in crime. No doubt, all these processes were at work; but they could not of themselves form \nobjects for psychiatric discourse; to pursue the description at this level one would fall short of what one was seeking. \nIf, in a particular period in the history of our society, the delinquent was psychologized and pathologized, if criminal \nbehaviour could give rise to a whole series of objects of knowledge, this was because a group of particular relations was \nadopted for use in psychiatric discourse. The relation between planes of specification like penal categories and degrees of \ndiminished responsibility, and planes of psychological characterization (faculties, aptitudes, degrees of development or \ninvolution, different ways of reacting to the environment, character types, whether acquired, innate, or hereditary). The \nrelation between the authority of medical decision and the authority of judicial decision (a really complex relation since \nmedical decision recognizes absolutely the authority of the judiciary to define crime, to determine the circumstances in \nwhich it is committed, and the punishment that it deserves; but reserves the right to analyse its origin and to determine the \ndegree of responsibility involved). The relation between the filter formed by judicial interrogation, police information, \ninvestigation, and the whole machinery of judicial information, and the filter formed by the medical questionnaire, \nclinical examinations, the search for antecedents, and biographical accounts. The relation between the family, sexual and \npenal norms of the behaviour of individuals, and the table of pathological symptoms and diseases of which they are the \nsigns. The relation between therapeutic confinement in hospital (with its own thresholds, its criteria of cure, its way of \ndistinguishing the normal from the pathological) and punitive confinement in prison (with its system of punishment and \npedagogy, its criteria of good conduct, improvement, \n \n \n((49)) \nand freedom). These are the relations that, operating in psychiatric discourse, have made possible the formation of a \nwhole group of various objects. \nLet us generalize: in. the nineteenth century, psychiatric discourse is characterized not by privileged objects, but by \nthe way in which it forms objects that are in fact highly dispersed. This formation is made possible by a group of \nrelations established between authorities of emergence, delimitation, and specification.

Which means that one cannot \nspeak of anything at any time; it is not easy to say something new; it is not enough for us to open our eyes, to pay \nattention, or to be aware, for new objects suddenly to light up and emerge out of the ground. But this difficulty is not \nonly a negative one; it must not be attached to some obstacle whose power appears to be, exclusively, to blind, to \nhinder, to prevent discovery, to conceal the purity of the evidence or the dumb obstinacy of the things themselves; the \nobject does not await in limbo the order that will free it and enable it to become embodied in a visible and prolix \nobjectivity; it does not pre-exist itself, held back by some obstacle at the first edges of light. It exists under the \npositive conditions of a complex group of relations. \n \n2.These relations are established between institutions, economic and social processes, behavioural patterns, \nsystems of norms, techniques, types of classification, modes of characterization; and these \n \n \n((50)) \nrelations are not present in the object; it is not they that are deployed when the object is being analysed; they do not \nindicate the web, the immanent rationality, that ideal nervure that reappears totally or in part when one conceives of the \nobject in the truth of its concept. They do not define its internal constitution, but what enables it to appear, to juxtapose \nitself with other objects, to situate itself in relation to them, to define its difference, its irreducibility, and even perhaps its \nheterogeneity, in short, to be placed in a field of exteriority. \n \n3.These relations must be distinguished first from what we might call 'primary' relations, and which, independently \nof all discourse or all object of discourse, may be described between institutions, techniques, social forms, etc. After \nall, we know very well that relations existed between the bourgeois family and the functioning of judicial authorities \nand categories in the nineteenth century that can he analysed in their own right. They cannot always be superposed \nupon the relations that go to form objects: the relations of dependence that may be assigned to this primary level are \nnot necessarily expressed in the formation of relations that makes discursive objects possible. But we must also \ndistinguish the secondary relations that are formulated in discourse itself: what, for example, the psychiatrists of the \nnineteenth century could say about the relations between the family and criminality does not reproduce, as we know, \nthe interplay of real dependencies; but neither does it reproduce the interplay of relations that make possible and \nsustain the objects of psychiatric discourse. Thus a space unfolds articulated with possible discourses: a system of real \nor primary relations, a system of reflexive or secondary relations, and a system of relations that might properly be \ncalled discursive. The problem is to reveal the specificity of these discursive relations, and their interplay with the \nother two kinds. \n \n4.Discursive relations are not, as we can see, internal to discourse: they do not connect concepts or words with one \nanother; they do not establish a deductive or rhetorical structure between propositions or sentences. Yet they are not \nrelations exterior to discourse, relations that might limit it, or impose certain forms upon it, or force it, in certain \ncircumstances, to state certain things. They are, in a sense, at the limit \n \n \n((51)) \nof discourse: they offer it objects of which it can speak, or rather (for this image of offering presupposes that objects are \nformed independently of discourse), they determine the group of relations that dis-course must establish in order to speak \nof this or that object, in order to deal with them, name them, analyse them, classify them, explain them, etc. These \nrelations characterize not the language (langue) used by dis-course, nor the circumstances in which it is deployed, but \ndiscourse itself as a practice. \n \nWe can now complete the analysis and see to what extent it fulfils, and to what extent it modifies, the initial project. \nTaking those group figures which, in an insistent but confused way, presented themselves as psychology, economics, \ngrammar, medicine, we asked on what kind of unity they could be based: were they simply a reconstruction after the \nevent, based on particular works, successive theories, notions and themes some of which had been abandoned, others \nmaintained by tradition, and again others fated to fall into oblivion only to be revived at a later date? Were they simply a \nseries of linked enterprises? \n",

    "chunk_full": "We sought the unity of discourse in the objects themselves, in their distribution, in the interplay of their differences, in \ntheir proximity or distance — in short, in what is given to the speaking subject; and, in the end, we are sent back to a \nsetting-up of relations that characterizes discursive practice itself; and what we discover is neither a configuration, nor a \nform, but a group of rules that are immanent in a practice, and define it in its specificity. We also used, as a point of \nreference, a unity like psychopathology: if we had wanted to provide it with a date of birth and precise limits, it would no \ndoubt have been necessary to discover when the word was first used, to what kind of analysis it could be applied, and \nhow it achieved its separation from neurology on the one hand and psychology on the other. What has emerged is a unity \nof another type, which does not appear to have the same dates, or the same surface, or the same articulations, but which \nmay take account of a group of objects for which the term psychopathology was merely a reflexive, secondary, \nclassificatory rubric. Psychopathology finally emerged as a discipline in a constant state of renewal, subject to constant \ndiscoveries, criticisms, and corrected errors; the system of \n \n \n((52)) \nformation that we have defined remains stable. But let there be no misunderstanding: it is not the objects that remain \nconstant, nor the domain that they form; it is not even their point of emergence or their mode of characterization; but the \nrelation between the surfaces on which they appear, on which they can be delimited, on which they can be analysed and \nspecified. \nIn the descriptions for which I have attempted to provide a theory, there can be no question of interpreting discourse \nwith a view to writing a history of the referent. In the example chosen, we are not trying to find out who was mad at a \nparticular period, or in what his madness consisted, or whether his disturbances were identical with those known to us \ntoday. We are not asking ourselves whether witches were unrecognized and presecuted madmen and madwomen, or \nwhether, at a different period, a mystical or aesthetic experience was not unduly medicalized. We are not trying to \nreconstitute what madness itself might be, in the form in which it first presented itself to some primitive, fundamental, \ndeaf, scarcely articulated' experience, and in the form in which it was later organized (translated, deformed, travestied, \nperhaps even repressed) by discourses, and the oblique, often twisted play of their operations. Such a history of the \nreferent is no doubt possible; and I have no wish at the outset to exclude any effort to uncover and free these \n'prediscursive' experiences from the tyranny of the text. But what we are concerned with here is not to neutralize \ndiscourse, to make it the sign of something else, and to pierce through its density in order to reach what remains silently \nanterior to it, but on the contrary to maintain it in its consistency, to make it emerge in its own complexity. What, in short, \nwe wish to do is to dispense with 'things'. To 'depresentify' them. To conjure up their rich, heavy, immediate plenitude, \nwhich we usually regard as the primitive law of a discourse that has become divorced. from it through error, oblivion, \nillusion, ignorance, or the inertia of beliefs and traditions, or even the perhaps unconscious desire not to see and not to \nspeak. To substitute for the enigmatic treasure of 'things' anterior to discourse, the regular formation of objects that \nemerge only in \n \n((footnote)) \n \n' This is written against an explicit theme of my book Madness and Civilization, and one that recurs particularly in the preface. \n((53)) \n \n \ndiscourse. To define these objects without reference to the ground, the foundation of things, but by relating them to the \nbody of rules that enable them to form as objects of a discourse and thus constitute the conditions of their historical \nappearance. To write a history of discursive objects that does not plunge them into the common depth of a primal soil, but \ndeploys the nexus of regularities that govern their dispersion. \nHowever, to suppress the stage of 'things themselves' is not necessarily to return to the linguistic analysis of meaning. \nWhen one describes the formation of the objects of a discourse, one tries to locate the relations that characterize a \ndiscursive practice, one determines neither a lexical organization, nor the scansions of a semantic field: one does not \nquestion the meaning given at a particular period to such words as 'melancholia' or 'madness without delirium', nor the \nopposition of content between 'psychosis' and 'neurosis'. Not, I repeat, that such analyses are regarded as illegitimate or \nimpossible; but they are not relevant when we are trying to discover, for example, how criminality could become an \nobject of medical expertise, or sexual deviation a possible object of psychiatric discourse. The analysis of lexical contents \ndefines either the elements of meaning at the disposal of speaking subjects in a given period, or the semantic structure \nthat appears on the surface of a discourse that has already been spoken; it does not concern discursive practice as a place \nin which a tangled plurality — at once superposed and incomplete — of objects is formed and deformed, appears and \ndisappears. \n",

We shall not return to the state anterior to discourse — in which nothing has yet been said, and in \nwhich things are only just beginning to emerge out of the grey light; and we shall not pass beyond discourse in order to \nrediscover the forms that it has created and left behind it; we shall remain, or try to remain, at the level of discourse itself. \nSince it is sometimes necessary to dot the 'i's of even the most obvious absences, I will say that in all these searches, in \nwhich I have still progressed so little, I would like to show that 'discourses', in the form in which they can he heard or \nread, are not, as one might expect, a mere intersection of things and words: an \n \n \n((54)) \n \n \nobscure web of things, and a manifest, visible, coloured chain of words; I would like to show that discourse is not a \nslender surface of contact, or confrontation, between a reality and a language (longue), the intrication of a lexicon and an \nexperience; I would like to show with precise examples that in analysing discourses themselves, one sees the loosening of \nthe embrace, apparently so tight, of words and things, and the emergence of a group of rules proper to discursive practice. \nThese rules define not the dumb existence of a reality, nor the canonical use of a vocabulary, but the ordering of objects. \n`Words and things' is the entirely serious title of a problem; it is the ironic title of a work that modifies its own form, \ndisplaces its own data, and reveals, at the end of the day, a quite different task. A task that consists of not — of no longer \n— treating discourses as groups of signs (signifying elements referring to contents or representations) but as practices that \nsystematically form the objects of which they speak. Of course, discourses are composed of signs; but what they do is \nmore than use these signs to designate things. It is this more that renders them irreducible to the language (longue) and to \nspeech. It is this `more' that we must reveal and describe. \n \n \n((55)) \n4. THE FORMATION OF \nENUNCIATIVE MODALITIES \nQualitative descriptions, biographical accounts, the location, interpretation, and cross-checking of signs, reasonings by \nanalogy, deduction, statistical calculations, experimental verifications, and many other forms of statement are to be found \nin the discourse of nineteenth-century doctors. What is it that links them together? What necessity binds them together? \nWhy these and not others? Before attempting an answer to such questions, we must first discover the law operating \nbehind all these diverse statements, and the place from which they come. \n \n(a) First question: who is speaking? Who, among the totality of speaking individuals, is accorded the right to use this \nsort of language (langage)? Who is qualified to do so? Who derives from it his own special quality, his prestige, and from \nwhom, in return, does he receive if not the assurance, at least the presumption that what he says is true? What is the status \nof the individuals who — alone — have the right, sanctioned by law or tradition., juridically defined or spontaneously \naccepted, to proffer such a discourse? The status of doctor involves criteria of competence and knowledge; institutions, \nsystems, \n \n \n((56)) \npedagogic norms; legal conditions that give the right — though not without laying down certain limitations — to practise \nand to extend one's knowledge. It also involves a system of differentiation and relations (the division of attributions, \nhierarchical subordination, functional complementarity, the request for and the provision and exchange of information) \nwith other individuals or other groups that also possess their own status (with the state and its representatives, with the \n",

It also involves a number \nof characteristics that define its functioning in relation to society as a whole (the role that is attributed to the doctor \naccording to whether he is consulted by a private person or summoned, more or less under compulsion, by society, \naccording to whether he practises a profession or carries out a function; the right to intervene or make decisions that is \naccorded him in these different cases; what is required of him as the supervisor, guardian, and guarantor of the health of a \npopulation, a group, a family, an individual; the payment that he receives from the community or from individuals; the \nform of contract, explicit or implicit, that he negotiates either with the group in which he practises, or with the authority \nthat entrusts him with a task, or with the patient who requests advice, treatment, or cure). This status of the doctor is \ngenerally a rather special one in all forms of society and civilization: he is hardly ever an undifferentiated or \ninterchangeable person. Medical statements cannot come from anybody; their value, efficacy, even their therapeutic \npowers, and, generally speaking, their existence as medical statements cannot be dissociated from the statutorily defined \nperson who has the right to make them, and to claim for them the power to overcome suffering and death. But we also \nknow that this status in western civilization was profoundly modified at the end of the eighteenth century when the health \nof the population became one of the economic norms required by industrial societies. \n \n(b) We must also describe the institutional sites from which the doctor makes his discourse, and from which this \ndiscourse derives its legitimate source and point of application (its specific objects and instruments of verification). In our \nsocieties, these sites are: the hospital, a place of constant, coded, systematic observation, run by a \n \n \n((57)) \ndifferentiated and hierarchized medical staff, thus constituting a quantifiable field of frequencies; private practice, which \noffers a field of less systematic, less complete, and far less numerous observations, but which sometimes facilitates \nobservations that are more far-reaching in their effects, with a better knowledge of the background and environment; the \nlaboratory, an autonomous place, long distinct from the hospital, where certain truths of a general kind, concerning the \nhuman body, life, disease, lesions, etc., which provide certain elements of the diagnosis, certain signs of the developing \ncondition, certain criteria of cure, and which makes therapeutic experiment possible; lastly, what might be called the \n'library' or documentary field, which includes not only the hooks and treatises traditionally recognized as valid, but also \nall the observations and case-histories published and transmitted, and the mass of statistical information (concerning the \nsocial environment, climate, epidemics, mortality rates, the incidence of diseases, the centres of contagion, occupational \ndiseases) that can be supplied to the doctor by public bodies, by other doctors, by sociologists, and by geographers. In this \nrespect, too, these various 'sites' of medical dis-course were profoundly modified in the nineteenth century: the \nimportance of the document continues to increase (proportionately diminishing the authority of the book or tradition); the \nhospital, which had been merely a subsidiary site for discourse on diseases, and which took second place in importance \nand value to private practice (in which diseases left in their natural environment were, in the eighteenth century, to reveal \nthemselves in their vegetal truth), then becomes the site of systematic, homogeneous observations, large-scale \nconfrontations, the establishment of frequencies and probabilities, the annulation of individual variants, in short, the site \nof the appearance of disease, not as a particular species, deploying its essential features beneath the doctor's gaze, but as \nan average process, with its significant guide-lines, boundaries, and potential development. Similarly, it was in the \nnineteenth century that daily medical practice integrated the laboratory as the site of a discourse that has the same \nexperimental norms as physics, chemistry, or biology. \n \n(c) The positions of the subject are also defined by the situation that it is possible for him to occupy in relation to the \nvarious domains or \n \n \n((58)) \ngroups of objects: according to a certain grid of explicit or implicit interrogations, he is the questioning subject and, \naccording to a certain programme of information, he is the listening subject; according to a table of characteristic \nfeatures, he is the seeing subject, and, according to a descriptive type, the observing subject; he is situated at an optimal \nperceptual distance whose boundaries delimit the wheat of relevant information; he uses instrumental intermediaries that \nmodify the scale of the information, shift the subject in relation to the average or immediate perceptual level, ensure his \nmovement from a superficial to a deep level, make him circulate in the interior space of the body — from manifest \nsymptoms to the organs, from the organs to the tissues, and finally from the tissues to the cells. To these perceptual \nsituations should be added the positions that the subject can occupy in the information networks (in theoretical teaching \nor in hospital training; in the system of oral communication or of written document: as emitter and receiver of \nobservations, case-histories, statistical data, general theoretical propositions, projects, and decisions). The various \nsituations that the subject of medical discourse may occupy were redefined at the beginning of the nineteenth century \n",

Relations between the hospital space as a place of \nassistance, of purified, systematic observation, and of partially proved, partially experimental therapeutics, and a whole \ngroup of perceptual codes of the human body — as it is defined by morbid anatomy; relations between the field of \nimmediate observations and the domain \n \n \n((59)) \nof acquired information; relations between the doctor's therapeutic role, his pedagogic role, his role as an intermediary in \nthe diffusion of medical knowledge, and his role as a responsible representative of public health in the social space. \nUnderstood as a renewal of points of view, contents, the forms and even the style of description, the use of inductive or \nprobabilistic reasoning, types of attribution of causality, i.n short, as a renewal of the modalities of enunciation, clinical \nmedicine must not be regarded as the result of a new technique of observation — that of autopsy, which was practised \nlong before the advent of the nineteenth century; nor as the result of the search for pathogenic causes in the depths of the \norganism — Morgagni was engaged in such a search in the middle of the eighteenth century; nor as the effect of that \nnew institution, the teaching hospital — such institutions had already been in existence for some decades in Austria and \nItaly; nor as the result of the introduction of the concept of tissue in Bichat's Traite des membranes. But as the \nestablishment of a relation, in medical discourse, between a number of distinct elements, some of which concerned the \nstatus of doctors, others the institutional and technical. site form which they spoke, others their position as subjects \nperceiving, observing, describing, teaching, etc. It can be said that this relation between different elements (some of \nwhich are new, while others were already in existence) is effected by clinical discourse: it is this, as a practice, that \nestablishes between them all. a system of relations that is not `really' given. or constituted a priori; and if there is a unity, \nif the modalities of enunciation that it uses, or to which it gives place, are not simply juxtaposed by a series of historical \ncontingencies, it is because it makes constant use of this group of relations. \nOne further remark. Having noted the disparity of the types of enunciation in clinical discourse, I have not tried. to \nreduce it by uncovering the formal structures, categories, modes of logical succession, types of reasoning and induction, \nforms of analysis and synthesis that may have operated in a discourse; I did not wish. to reveal the rational organization \nthat may provide statements like those of medicine with their element of intrinsic necessity. Nor did I wish to reduce to a \nsingle founding act, or to a founding consciousness the general horizon of rationality against which the progress of \nmedicine gradually emerged, its efforts to model itself upon the exact sciences, the \n \n \n((60)) \ncontraction of its methods of observation, the slow, difficult expulsion of the images or fantasies that inhabit it, the \npurification of its system of reasoning. Lastly, I have not tried to describe the empirical genesis, nor the various \ncomponent elements of the medical mentality: how this shift of interest on the part of the doctors came about, by what \ntheoretical or experimental model they were influenced, what philosophy or moral thematics defined the climate of their \nreflexion, to what questions, to what demands, they had to reply, what efforts were required of them to free themselves \nfrom traditional prejudices, by what ways they were led towards a unification and coherence that were never achieved, \nnever reached, by their knowledge. In short, I do not refer the various enunciative modalities to the unity of the subject — \nwhether it concerns the subject regarded as the pure founding authority of rationality, or the subject regarded as an \nempirical function of synthesis. Neither the 'knowing' (le 'connaitre'), nor the 'knowledge' (les 'connaissances'). \nIn the proposed analysis, instead of referring back to the synthesis or the unifying function of a subject, the various \nenunciative modalities manifest his dispersion.' To the various statuses, the various sites, the various sites, the various \npositions that he can occupy or be given when making a discourse. To th.e discontinuity of the planes from which he \nspeaks. And if these planes are linked by a system of relations, this system is not established by the synthetic activity of a \nconsciousness identical with itself, dumb and anterior to all speech, but by the specificity of a discursive practice. I shall \nabandon any attempt, therefore, to see discourse as a phenomenon of expression — the verbal translation of a previously \nestablished synthesis; instead, I shall look for a field of regularity for various positions of subjectivity. Thus conceived, \ndis-course is not the majestically unfolding manifestation of a thinking, knowing, speaking subject, but, on the contrary, a \ntotality, in which the dispersion of the subject and his discontinuity with himself may be determined.

    "chunk_full": "(a) This organization involves firstly forms of succession. And among them, the various orderings of enunciative \nseries (whether the order of inferences, successive implications, and demonstrative reasonings; or the order of \ndescriptions, the schemata of generalization or progressive specification to which. they are subject, the spatial \ndistributions that they cover; or the order of the descriptive accounts, and the way in which the events of the time are \ndistributed in the linear succession of the statements); the various types of dependence of the statements (which are not \nalways either identical or superposable on the manifest successions of the series of statements: this is the case in the \ndependences of hypothesis/verification, assertion/critique, general law/particular application; the various rhetorical \nschemata according to which groups of statements may he combined, (how descriptions, deductions, definitions, whose \nsuccession characterizes the architecture of a text, are linked together). Take, for example, the case of Natural History in \nthe Classical period: it does not use the same concepts as in the sixteenth century; certain of the older concepts (genus, \nspecies, signs) are used in different ways; new concepts (like that of structure) appear; and others (like that of organism) \nare formed later. But what was altered in the seventeenth century, and was to govern the appearance and recurrence of \nconcepts, for the whole of Natural History, was the general arrangement of the statements, their successive arrangement \nin particular wholes; it was the way in which one wrote down what one observed and, by means of a series of statements, \nrecreated a perceptual process; it was the relation and interplay of subordinations between describing, articulating into \ndistinctive features, characterizing, and classifying; it was the reciprocal position of particular observations and general \nprinciples; it was the system of dependence between what one learnt, what one saw, what one deduced, what one \naccepted as prob-able, and what one postulated. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Natural History was not \nsimply a form of knowledge that gave a new definition to concepts like 'genus' or 'character', and which introduced new \nconcepts like that of 'natural classification' or 'mammal'; above all, it was a set of rules for arranging statements in series, \nan obligatory set of schemata of dependence, of order, and of successions, in which the recurrent elements that may have \nvalue as concepts were distributed. \n \n \n((64)) \n(b) The configuration of the enunciative field also involves forms of coexistence. These outline first a field of \npresence (by which is understood all statements formulated elsewhere and taken up in a discourse, acknowledged to be \ntruthful, involving exact description, well-founded reasoning, or necessary presupposition); we must also give our \nattention to those that are criticized, discussed, and judged, as well as those that are rejected or excluded); in this field of \npresence, the relations established may be of the order of experimental verification, logical validation, mere repetition, \nacceptance justified by tradition and authority, commentary, a search for hidden meanings, the analysis of error; these \nrelations may be explicit (and sometimes formulated in types of specialized statements: references, critical discussions), \nor implicit and present in ordinary statements. Again, it is easy to see that the field of presence of Natural History in the \nClassical period does not obey the same forms, or the same criteria of choice, or the same principles of exclusion, as in \nthe period when Aldrovandi was collecting in one and the same text everything that had been seen, observed, recounted, \npassed on innumerable times by word of mouth, and even imagined by the poets, on the subject of monsters. Distinct \nfrom this field of presence one may also describe a field of concomitance (this includes statements that concern quite \ndifferent domains of objects, and belong to quite different domains of objects, and belong to quite different types of \ndiscourse, but which are active among the statements studied here, either because they serve as analogical confirmation, \nor because they serve as a general principle and as premises accepted by a reasoning, or because they serve as models \nthat can be transferred to other contents, or because they function as a higher authority than that to which at least certain \npropositions are presented and subjected): thus the field of concomitance of the Natural History of the period of \nLinnaeus and Buffon is defined by a number of relations with cosmology, the history of the earth, philosophy, theology, \nscripture and biblical exegesis, mathematics (in the very general form of a science of order); and all these relations \ndistinguish it from both the discourse of the sixteenth-century naturalists and that of the nineteenth-century biologists. \nLastly, the enunciative field involves what might be called a field of memory (statements that are no longer accepted or \ndiscussed, and which consequently no longer define either a body of truth or a domain of \n \n",

These procedures may appear: in \ntechniques of rewriting (like those, for example, that enabled the naturalists of the Classical period to rewrite linear \ndescriptions in classificatory tables that have neither the same laws nor the same configuration as the lists and groups of \nkinship established in the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance); in methods of transcribing statements (articulated in \nthe natural language) according to a more or less formalized and artificial language (the project, and to a certain extent \nthe realization, of such a language is to be found in Linnaeus and Adanson); the modes of translating quantitative \nstatements into qualitative formulations and vice versa (the establishment of relations between purely perceptual \nmeasurements and descriptions); the means used to increase the approximation of statements and to refine their exactitude \n(structural analysis according to the form, number, arrangement, and size of the elements has made it possible, since \nTournefort, to achieve a closer and above all more constant approximation of descriptive statements); the way in which \none delimits once again — by extension or restriction. — the domain of validity of statements (the enunciation of \nstructural characters was restricted in the period between Tournefort and Linnaeus, then enlarged in that between Buffon \nand Jussieu); the way in which one transfers a type of \n \n \n((66)) \nstatement from one field of application to another (like the transference from vegetal characterization to animal \ntaxonomy; or from the description of superficial characters to the internal elements of the organism); the methods of \nsystematizing propositions that already exist, because they have been previously formulated, but in a separated state; or \nagain the methods of redistributing statements that are already linked together, but which one rearranges in a new \nsystematic whole (as Adanson takes up the natural characterizations that had been made before, either by himself or by \nothers, and placed them in a group of artificial descriptions, the schema of which he had previously worked out on the \nbasis of some abstract combinatory). \n \nThese elements that I am proposing to analyse are of rather different kinds. Some constitute rules of formal \nconstruction, others rhetorical practices; some define the internal configuration of a text, others the modes of relation and \ninterference between different texts; some are characteristic of a particular period, others have a distant origin and far-\nreaching chronological import. But what properly belongs to a discursive formation and what makes it possible to delimit \nthe group of concepts, disparate as they may be, that are specific to it, is the way in which these different elements are \nrelated to one another: the way in which, for example, the ordering of descriptions or accounts is linked to the techniques \nof rewriting; the way in which the field of memory is linked to the forms of hierarchy and subordination that govern the \nstatements of a text; the way in which the modes of approximation and development of the statements are linked to the \nmodes of criticism, commentary and interpretation of previously formulated statements, etc. It is this group of relations \nthat constitutes a system of conceptual formation. \nThe description of such a system could not be valid for a direct, immediate description of the concepts themselves. My \nintention is not to carry out an exhaustive observation of them, to establish the characteristics that they may have in \ncommon, to undertake a classification of them, to measure their internal coherence, or to test their mutual compatibility; I \ndo not wish to take as an object of analysis the conceptual architecture of an isolated text, an individual oeuvre, or a \nscience at a particular moment in time.

These four schemata — attribution, articulation, designation, and dervation — do not designate con-\ncepts that were in fact used by the Classical grammarians; nor do they make it possible to reconstitute, over and above \ndifferent grammatical works, a sort of more general, more abstract, more impoverished system, but discover, by that very \nfact, the profound compatibility of these different, apparently opposed systems. They make it possible to describe: \n \n1. How the different grammatical analyses can be ordered and deployed; and what forms of succession are possible \nbetween analyses of the noun, analyses of the verb, and analyses of the adjective, those that concern phonetics and those \nthat concern syntax, those that concern the original language (longue), and those that project an artificial language \n(longue). These different orders are laid down by the relations of dependence that may be observed between the theories \nof attribution, articulation, designation, and derivation. \n \n \n((68)) \n2.How General Grammar defines a domain of validity for itself (according to what criteria one may discuss the \ntruth or falsehood of a proposition); how it constitutes a domain of normativity for itself (according to what criteria \none may exclude certain statements as being irrelevant to the discourse, or as inessential and marginal, or as non-\nscientific); how it constitutes a domain of actuality for itself (comprising acquired solutions, defining present \nproblems, situating concepts and affirmations that have fallen into disuse). \n \n3.What relations General Grammar has with Mathesis (with Cartesian and post-Cartesian algebra, with th.e project \nof a general science of order), with the philosophical analysis of representation and the theory of signs, with Natural \nHistory, the problems of characterization and taxonomy, with the Analysis of Wealth and the problems of the \narbitrary signs of measurem.en.t and exchange: by marking out these relations one may determine the ways by which \nthe circulation, the transfer and the modification of concepts, the alteration of their form or changes in their field of \napplication, are made possible between one domain and another. The network formed by the four theoretical \nsegments does not define the logical architecture of all the concepts used by grammarians; it outlines the regular \nspace of their formation. \n \n4.How the various conceptions of the verb 'to be', of the copula, of the verbal radical and the flexional ending (for \na theoretical schema of attribution) were simultaneously or successively possible (under the form of alternative \nchoice, modification, or substitution); the various conceptions of the phonetic elements, of the alphabet, of the name, \nof substantives and adjectives (for a theoretical schema of articulation); the various concepts of proper noun. and \ncommon noun, demonstrative, nominal root, syllable or expressive sonority (for the theoretical segment of \ndesignation); the various concepts of original and derived language (langage), metaphor and figure, poetic language \n(langage) (for the theoretical segment of derivation). \n \nThe 'preconceptual' level that we have uncovered refers neither to a horizon of ideality nor to an empirical genesis of \nabstractions. On the one hand, it is not a horizon of ideality, placed, discovered, or \n \n \n((69)) \nestablished by a founding gesture — and one that is so original that it eludes all chronological insertion; it is not an \ninexhaustible a priori at the confines of history, set back both because it eludes all beginning, all genetic restitution, and \nbecause it could never he contemporary with itself in an explicit totality.

Instead of outlining a horizon that rises from the depths \nof history and maintains itself through history, the 'preconceptual' thus described is, on the contrary, at the most \n'superficial' level (at the level of discourse), the group of rules that in fact operate within it. \nNor is it a genesis of abstractions, trying to rediscover the series of operations that have made it possible to constitute \nthem: overall intuitions, discoveries of particular cases, the disconnexion of imaginary themes, the encountering of \ntheoretical or technical obstacles, succes-sive borrowings from traditional models, definition of the adequate formal \nstructure, etc. In the analysis proposed here, the rules of forma-tion operate not only in the mind or consciousness of \nindividuals, but in discourse itself; they operate therefore, according to a sort of uniform anonymity, on all individuals \nwho undertake to speak in this \n \n \n((70)) \ndiscursive field. On the other hand, one does not suppose them to be universally valid for every domain; one always \ndescribes them in particular discursive fields, and one does not accord them at the outset indefinite possibilities of \nextension. The most one can do is to make a systematic comparison, from one region to another, of the rules for the \nformation of concepts: it is in this way that I have tried to uncover the identities and differences that may be presented \nby these groups of rules in the General Grammar, the Natural History, and the Analysis of Wealth of the Classical \nperiod. These groups of rules are specific enough in each of these domains to characterize a particular, well-\nindividualized discursive formation; but they offer enough analogies for us to see these various formations form a wider \ndiscursive grouping at a higher level. In any case, the rules governing the formation of concepts, however generalized \nthe concepts may be, are not the result, laid down in history and deposited in. the depth of collective customs, of \noperations carried out by individuals; they do not constitute the bare schema of a whole obscure work, in the course of \nwhich concepts would be made to emerge through illusions, prejudices, errors, and traditions. The preconceptual field \nallows the emergence of the dis-cursive regularities and constraints that have made possible the heterogeneous \nmultiplicity of concepts, and, beyond these the profusion of the themes, beliefs, and representations with which one \nusually deals when one is writing the history of ideas. \nIn order to analyse the rules for the formation of objects, one must neither, as we have seen, embody them in things, \nnor relate them to the domain of words; in order to analyse the formation of enunciative types, one must relate them \nneither to the knowing subject, nor to a psychological individuality. Similarly, to analyse the formation of concepts, one \nmust relate them neither to the horizon of ideality, nor to the empirical progress of ideas. \n6. THE FORMATION OF STRATEGIES \nSuch discourses as economics, medicine, grammar, the science of liv-ing beings give rise to certain organizations of \nconcepts, certain regroupings of objects, certain types of enunciation, which form, according to their degree of coherence, \nrigour, and stability, themes or theories: the theme, in eighteenth-century grammar, of an original language (longue) from \nwhich all others derive, and of which all others carry within themselves a sometimes decipherable memory; a theory, in \nnineteenth-century philology, of a kinship between all the Indo-European languages, and of an archaic idiom that served \nas a common starting-point; a theme, in the eighteenth century, of an evolution of the species deploying in time the \ncontinuity of nature, and explaining the present gaps in the taxonomic table; a theory, propounded by the Physiocrats, of a \ncirculation of wealth on the basis of agricultural production.

Is it necessity that links them \ntogether, makes them invisible, calls them to their right places one after another, and makes of them successive solutions \nto one and the same problem? Or chance encounters between ideas of different origin, influences, discoveries, \n \n((72)) \nspeculative climates, theoretical models that the patience or genius of individuals arranges into more or less well-\nconstituted wholes? Or can one find a regularity between them and define the common system of their formation? \nAs for the analysis of these strategies, I can hardly enter into great detail. The reason is simple enough: in the various \ndiscursive domains, which I have tried to sketch out — rather hesitantly no doubt, and, especially at the beginning, with \ninadequate methodological control — the problem was to describe in each case the discursive formation in all its \ndimensions, and according to its own characteristics: it was necessary therefore to describe each time the rules for the \nformation of objects, modalities of statement, concepts, and theoretical choices. But it turned out that the difficult point \nof the analysis, and the one that demanded greatest attention, was not the same in each case. In Madness and \nCivilization, I was dealing with a discursive formation whose theoretical points of choice were fairly easy to locate, \nwhose conceptual systems were relatively uncomplex and few in number, and whose enunciative rules were fairly \nhomogeneous and repetitive; on the other hand, the problem lay in the emergence of a whole group of highly complex, \ninterwoven objects; it was necessary above all to describe the formation of these objects, in order to locate in its \nspecificity the whole of psychiatric discourse. In Naissance de la clinique, the essential point of the research was the way \nin which, at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the enunciative forms of medical \ndiscourse had been modified; the analysis was concerned therefore less with the formation of conceptual systems, or the \nformation of theoretical choices, than with the status, the institutional siting, the situation, and the modes of insertion \nused by the discoursing subject. Lastly, in The Order of Things, my attention was concentrated mainly on the net-works \nof concepts and their rules of formation (identical or different) as they could be located in General Grammar, Natural \nHistory, and the Analysis of Wealth. The place, and the implications, of the strategic choices were indicated (whether, \nfor example, in the case of Linnaeus and Buffon, or the Physiocrats and the Utilitarists); but I did little more than locate \nthem, and my analysis scarcely touched on their formation. Let us say that a fuller analysis of theoretical choices \n \n \n((73)) \nmust be left until a later study, in which I shall be able to give it my whole attention. \nFor the moment, the most that I can do is to indicate the directions in which the research will proceed. These might be \nsummarized thus: \n \nI . Determine the possible points of diffraction of discourse. These points are characterized in the first instance as \npoints of incompatibility: two objects, or two types of enunciation, or two concepts may appear, in the same discursive \nformation, without being able to enter — under pain of manifest contradiction or inconsequence — the same series of \nstatements. They are then characterized as points of equivalence: the two incompatible elements are formed in the same \nway and on the basis of the same rules; the conditions of their appearance are identical; they are situated at the same \nlevel; and instead of constituting a mere defect of coherence, they form an alternative: even if, chronologically speak-ing, \nthey do not appear at the same time, even if they do not have the same importance, and if they were not equally \nrepresented in the population of effective statements, they appear in the form of 'either . . . or'. Lastly, they are \ncharacterized as link points of systematization: on the basis of each of these equivalent, yet incompatible elements, a \ncoherent series of objects, forms of statement, and concepts has been derived (with, in each series, possible new points of \nincompatibility). In other words, the dispersions studied at previous levels do not simply constitute gaps, non-identities, \ndiscontinuous series; they come to form discursive sub-groups — those very sub-groups that are usually regarded as \nbeing of major importance, as if they were the immediate unity and raw material out of which larger discursive groups \n('theories', 'conceptions', 'themes') are formed. For example, one does not consider, in an analysis of this kind, that the \nAnalysis of Wealth, in the eighteenth century, was the result (by way of simultaneous composition or chronological \nsuccession) of several different conceptions of coinage, of the exchange of objects of need, of the formation of value and \nprices, or of ground rent; one does not consider that it is made up of the ideas of Cantillon, taking up from those of Petty, \nof Law's experience reflected by various theoreticians in turn, and of the Physiocratic system opposing Utilitarist \nconceptions. One describes it rather as a unity of distribution that opens a field of possible options, and enables \n \n \n((74)) \nvarious mutually exclusive architectures to appear side by side or in turn. \n \n",

But all the possible alternatives are not in fact realized: there are a good many partial groups, regional \ncompatibilities, and coherent architectures that might have emerged, yet did not do so. In order to account for the choices \nthat were made out of all those that could have been made (and those alone), one must describe the specific authorities \nthat guided one's choice. Well to the fore is the role played by the discourse being studied in relation to those that are \ncontemporary with it or related to it. One must study therefore the economy of the discursive constellation to which it \nbelongs. It may in fact play the role of a formal system of which other discourses are applications with various semantic \nfields; it may, on the other hand, he that of a concrete model that must be applied to other discourses at a higher level of \nabstraction (thus General Grammar, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, appears as a particular model of the \ngeneral theory of signs and representation). The discourse under study may also be in a relation of analogy, opposition, or \ncomplementarity with certain other discourses (there is, for example, a relation of analogy, in the Classical period, \nbetween the Analysis of Wealth and Natural History; the first is to the representation of need and desire what the second \nis to the representation of perceptions and judgements; one may also note that Natural History and General Grammar are \nopposed to one another in the same way as a theory of natural characters and a theory of conventional signs; both, in turn, \nare opposed to the Analysis of Wealth just as the study of qualitative signs is opposed to that of the quantitative signs of \nmeasurement; each, in fact, develops one of the three complementary roles of the representative sign: designation, \nclassification, exchange). Lastly, one may describe between several discourses relations of mutual delimitation, each \ngiving the other the distinctive marks of its singularity by the differentiation of its domain of application (as in the case of \npsychiatry and organic medicine which were virtually not distinguished from one another before the end of the eighteenth \ncentury, and which established from that moment a gap that has since characterized them). This whole group of relations \nforms a principle of determination that permits or excludes, within a given discourse, a \n((75)) \ncertain number of statements: these are conceptual systematizations, enunciative series, groups and organizations of \nobjects that might have been possible (and of which nothing can justify the absence at the level of their own rules of \nformation), but which are excluded by a dis-cursive constellation at a higher level and in a broader space. A dis-cursive \nformation does not occupy therefore all the possible volume that is opened up to it of right by the systems of formation \nof its objects, its enunciations, and its concepts; it is essentially incomplete, owing to the system of formation of its \nstrategic choices. Hence the fact that, taken up again, placed, and interpreted in a new constellation, a given discursive \nformation may reveal new possibilities (thus in the present distribution of scientific discourses, the Grammar of Port-\nRoyal or the taxonomy of Linnaeus may free elements that, in relation to them, are both intrinsic and new); but we are \nnot dealing with a silent content that has remained implicit, that has been said and yet not said, and which constitutes \nbeneath manifest statements a sort of sub-discourse that is more fundamental, and which is now emerging at last into the \nlight of day; what we are dealing with is a modification in the principle of exclusion and the principle of the possibility \nof choices; a modification that is due to an insertion in a new discursive constellation. \n \n3. The determination of the theoretical choices that were actually made is also dependent upon another authority. This \nauthority is characterized first by the function that the discourse under study must carry out in a field of non-discursive \npractices. Thus General Grammar played a role in pedagogic practice; in a much more obvious, and much more \nimportant way, the Analysis of Wealth played a role not only in the political and economic decisions of governments, \nbut in the scarcely conceptualized, scarcely theoretized, daily practice of emergent capital-ism, and in the social and \npolitical struggles that characterized the Classical period. This authority also involves the rules and processes of \nappropriation of discourse: for in our societies (and no doubt in many others) the property of discourse — in the sense of \nthe right to speak, ability to understand, licit and immediate access to the corpus of already formulated statements, and \nthe capacity to invest this discourse in decisions, institutions, or practices — is in fact confined (sometimes \n \n \n((76)) \nwith the addition of legal sanctions) to a particular group of individuals; in the bourgeois societies that we have known \nsince the sixteenth century, economic discourse has never been a common dis-course (no more than medical or literary \ndiscourse, though in a different way). Lastly, this authority is characterized by the possible positions of desire in relation \nto discourse: discourse may in fact be the place for a phantasmatic representation, an element of symbolization, a form of \nthe forbidden, an instrument of derived satisfaction (this possibility of being in relation with desire is not simply the fact \nof the poetic, fictional, or imaginary practice of discourse: the discourses on wealth, on language (langage), on nature, on \nmadness, on life and death, and many others, perhaps, that are much more abstract, may occupy very specific positions in \nrelation to desire). In any case, the analysis of this authority must show that neither the relation of discourse to desire, nor \nthe processes of its appropriation, nor its role among non-discursive practices is extrinsic to its unity, its characterization, \nand the laws of its formation. They are not disturbing elements which, superposing themselves upon its pure, neutral, \natemporal, silent form, suppress its true voice and emit in its place a travestied discourse, but, on the contrary, its \n",

For example, the Analysis of Wealth in the seventeenth \nand eighteenth centuries is characterized by the system that could form both Colbert's mercantilism and Cantillon's 'neo-\nmercantilism'; Law's strategy and that of Paris-Duverney; the Physiocratic option and the Utilitarist option. And one will \nhave defined this system if one can describe how the points of diffraction of economic discourse derive from one another, \nregulate one another, and are involved with one another (how a point of choice about prices derives from a decision about \nthe concept of value); how the choices made depend on the general constellation in which economic discourse figures \n(the choice in favour of coinage-sign is linked to the place occupied by the Analysis of Wealth, beside the theory of \nlanguage (langage), the \n \n \n((77)) \nanalysis of representations, mathesis, and the science of order) ; how these choices are linked to the function carried out \nby economic dis-course in the practice of emergent capitalism, the process of appropriation of which it is the object on \nthe part of the bourgeoisie, the role that it can play in the realization of interests and desires. Economic discourse, in the \nClassical period, is defined by a certain constant way of relating possibilities of systematization interior to a discourse, \nother discourses that are exterior to it, and a whole non-discursive field of practices, appropriation, interests, and desires. \nIt should be noted that the strategies thus described are not rooted, anterior to discourse, in the silent depths of a choice \nthat is both preliminary and fundamental. All these groups of discourses that are to be described are not the expression of \na world-view that has been coined in the form of words, nor the hypocritical translation of an interest masquerading under \nthe pretext of a theory: the Natural His-tory of the Classical period is more than a confrontation, in the limbo that \nprecedes manifest history, between a (Linnaean) view of a static, ordered, compartmented universe that is subjected from \nits very beginnings to the classificatory table, and the still confused perception of a nature that is the heir to time, with all \nthe weight of its accidents, and open to the possibility of an evolution; similarly, the Analysis of Wealth is more than. the \nconflict of interest between a bourgeoisie that has become a land-owning class, expressing its economic or political \ndemands through the Physiocrats, and a commercial bourgeoisie that demands protectionist or liberal measures through \nthe Utilitarists. Neither the Analysis of Wealth, nor Natural History, if one questions them at the level of their existence, \ntheir unity, their permanence, an.d their transformations, may be regarded as the sum of these various options. On the \ncontrary, these options must be described as systematically different ways of treating objects of discourse (of delimiting \nthem, regrouping or separating them, linking them together and making them derive from one another), of arranging \nforms of enunciation (of choosing them, placing them, constituting series, composing them into great rhetorical unities), \nof manipulating concepts (of giving them rules for their use, inserting them into regional coherences, and thus \nconstituting conceptual architectures). These options are not seeds of discourse (in which discourses are determined in \nadvance and \n \n \n((78)) \nprefigured in a quasi-microscopic form); they are regulated ways (and describable as such) of practising the possibilities \nof discourse. \nBut these strategies must not be analysed either as secondary elements that are superposed on a discursive rationality \nthat is, of right, independent of them.. There is not (or, at least, as far as the historical description whose possibility we are \ntracing here is concerned) a sort of ideal discourse that is both ultimate and timeless, and which choices, extrinsic in \norigin, have perverted, disturbed, suppressed, or thrust towards a possibly distant future; one must not suppose for \nexample that it holds on nature or on the economy two superposed and intermingled discourses: one that proceeds slowly, \naccumulating its acquisitions and gradually achieving completion (a true discourse, but one that exists in its pure state \nonly at the teleological confines of history); the other forever disintegrating, recommenced, in perpetual rupture with \nitself, composed of heterogeneous fragments (a discourse of opinion that history, in the course of time, throws back into \nthe past). There is no natural taxonomy that has been exact, fixism excepted; there is no economy of exchange and use \nthat has been true, without the preferences and illusions of a mercantile bourgeoisie. Classical taxonomy or the Analysis \nof Wealth, in the form in which they actually existed, and constituted historical figures, involve, in an articulated but \nindissociable system, objects, statements, concepts, and theoretical choices. And just as one must not relate the formation \nof objects either to words or to things, nor that of statements either to the pure form of knowledge or to the psychological \nsubject, nor that of concepts either to the structure of ideality or to the succession of ideas, one must not relate the \nformation of theoretical choices either to a fundamental project or to the secondary play of opinions. \n \n \n",

But in cases when their historical limits and the specificity of their organization are fairly easy to \nperceive (witness General Grammar or Natural History), these discursive formations present far more difficult problems \nof location than the book, or the oeuvre. Why, then, proceed to such dubious regroupings at the very moment when one is \nchallenging those that once seemed the most obvious? What new domain is one hoping to \n \n \n((80)) \ndiscover? What hitherto obscure or implicit relations? What transformations that have hitherto remained outside the \nreach of historians? In short, what descriptive efficacy can one accord to these new analyses? I shall try to answer all \nthese questions later. But for the moment I must reply to a question that is primary in relation to these later analyses, and \nterminal in relation to the preceding ones: on the question of the discursive formations that I have tried to define, can one \nreally speak of unities? Is the re-division that I am proposing capable of individualizing wholes? And what is the nature \nof the unity thus discovered or constructed? \nWe set out with an observation: with the unity of a discourse like that of clinical medicine, or political economy, or \nNatural History, we are dealing with a dispersion of elements. This dispersion itself — with its gaps, its discontinuities, \nits entanglements, its incompatibilities, its replacements, and its substitutions — can be described in its uniqueness if one \nis able to determine the specific rules in accordance with which its objects, statements, concepts, and theoretical options \nhave been formed: if there really is a unity, it does not lie in the visible, horizontal coherence of the elements formed; it \nresides, well anterior to their formation, in the system that makes possible and governs that forma-tion. But in what way \ncan we speak of unities and systems? How can we affirm that we have properly individualized certain discursive groups \nor wholes? When in a highly random way we have uncovered, behind the apparently irreducible multiplicity of objects, \nstatements, concepts, and choices, a mass of elements that were no less numerous or dispersed, but which were \nheterogeneous with one another? When we have divided these elements into four distinct groups whose mode of \narticulation has scarcely been defined? And in what sense can one say that all these elements that have been uncovered \nbehind the objects, statements, concepts, and strategies of discourses guarantee the existence of no less individualizable \nwholes such as oeuvres or books? \n \n1. As we have seen — and there is probably no need to reiterate it — when one speaks of a system of formation, one \ndoes not only mean the juxtaposition, coexistence, or interaction of heterogeneous elements (institutions, techniques, \nsocial groups, perceptual organizations, relations between various discourses), but also the relation that is \n \n",

How can they all define a single system of formation? \nIn fact, the different levels thus defined are not independent of one another. I have shown that the strategic choices do \nnot emerge directly from a world-view or from a predominance of interests peculiar to this or that speaking subject; but \nthat their very possibility is determined by points of divergence in the group of concepts; I have also shown that concepts \nwere not formed directly against the approximative, confused, and living background of ideas, but on the basis of forms \nof coexistence between statements; and, as we have seen, the modalities of enunciation were described on the basis of the \nposition occupied by the subject in relation to the domain of objects of which he is speaking. In this way, there exists a \nvertical system of dependences: not all the positions of the subject, all the types of coexistence between statements, all the \ndiscursive strategies, are equally possible, but only those authorized by anterior levels; given, for example, the system of \nforma-tion that governed, in the eighteenth century, the objects of Natural History (as individualities possessing \ncharacters, and therefore classifiable; as structural elements capable of variation; as visible, analysable surfaces; as a field \nof continuous, regular differences), certain modalities of enunciation are excluded (for example, the decipherment of \nsigns), others are implied (for example, description according to a particular code); given, too, the different positions that \nthe discoursing subject may occupy (as an observing subject with instrumental mediation, as a subject selecting out of the \nperceptual plurality only the elements of the structure, as a subject transcribing these elements into a coded vocabulary, \netc.), there are a number of coexistences between the statements that are excluded (as, for example, the erudite reactiva-\ntion of the already-said, or the exegetic commentary of a sacralized text), others on the other hand that are possible or \nrequired (such as the integration of totally or partially analogous statements into a classificatory table). The levels are not \nfree from one another therefore, and are not deployed according to an unlimited autonomy: between the primary \ndifferentiation of objects and the formation of discursive strategies there exists a whole hierarchy of relations. \n \n \n((82)) \nBut relations are also established in a reverse direction. The lower levels are not independent of those above them. \nTheoretical choices exclude or imply, in the statements in which they are made, the forma-tion of certain concepts, that is, \ncertain forms of coexistence between statements: thus in the texts of the Physiocrats, one will not find the same modes of \nintegrating quantitative data and measurements as in the analyses of the Utilitarists. It is not that the Physiocratic option \ncan modify the group of rules that govern the formation of economic concepts in the eighteenth century; but it can \nimplement some of these rules and exclude others and consequently reveal certain concepts (like that, for example, of the \nnet product) that appear nowhere else. It is not the theoretical choice that governs the formation of the concept; but the \nchoice has produced the concept by the mediation of specific rules for the formation of concepts, and by the set of \nrelations that it holds with this level. \n \n2. These systems of formation must not be taken as blocks of immobility, static forms that are imposed on discourse \nfrom the out-side, and that define once and for all its characteristics and possibilities. They are not constraints whose \norigin is to be found in the thoughts of men, or in the play of their representations; but nor are they determinations which, \nformed at the level of institutions, or social or economic relations, transcribe themselves by force on the surface of \ndiscourses. These systems — I repeat — reside in discourse itself; or rather (since we are concerned not with its \ninteriority and what it may contain, but with its specific existence and with its conditions) on its frontier, at that limit at \nwhich the specific rules that enable it to exist as such are defined. By system of formation, then, I mean a complex group \nof relations that function as a rule: it lays down what must be related, in a particular discursive practice, for such and such \nan enunciation to be made, for such and such a concept to be used, for such and such a strategy to be organized. To define \na system of formation in its specific individuality is therefore to characterize a discourse or a group of statements by the \nregularity of a practice. \nAs a group of rules for a discursive practice, the system of formation is not a stranger to time. It does not concentrate \neverything that may appear through an age-old series of statements into an initial point that \n((83)) \nis, at the same time, beginning, origin, foundation, system of axioms, and on the basis of which the events of real history \nhave merely to unfold in a quite necessary way.

A discursive formation, then, does not play the role of a figure that arrests time and freezes it for decades \nor centuries; it determines a regularity proper to temporal processes; it presents the principle of articulation between a \nseries of discursive events and other series of events, transformations, mutations, and processes. It is not an atemporal \nform, but a schema of correspondence between several temporal series. \nThis mobility of the system of formation appears in two ways. First at the level of the elements that are being related to \none another: these in fact may undergo a number of intrinsic mutations that are integrated into discursive practice without \nthe general form of its regularity being altered; thus, throughout the nineteenth century, criminal juris-prudence, \ndemographic pressure, the demand for labour, the forms of public assistance, the status and juridical conditions of \ninternment, were continually changing; yet the discursive practice of psychiatry continued to establish the same group of \nrelations between these elements; in this way, the system preserved the characteristics of its individuality; through the \nsame laws of formation, new objects appear (new types of individuals, new classes of behaviour are characterized as \npathological), new modalities of enunciation are put into operation (quantitative notations and statistical calculations), \nnew concepts are outlined (such as those of degeneracy, perversion, neurosis), and of course new theoretical structures \ncan be built. But, inversely, the dis-cursive practices modify the domains that they relate to one another. It is no use \nestablishing specific relations that can be analysed only at their \n \n \n((84)) \nown level — the effect of these relations is not confined to discourse alone: it is also felt in the elements that they \narticulate upon one another. The hospital field, for example, did not remain unaffected when clinical discourse was put \ninto relation with the laboratory: the body of rules that governed its working, the status accorded the hospital doctor, the \nfunction of his observation, the level of analysis that can be carried out in it, were necessarily modified. \n \n3. What are described as 'systems of formation' do not constitute the terminal stage of discourse, if by that term one \nmeans the texts (or words) as they appear, with their vocabulary, syntax, logical structure, or rhetorical organization. \nAnalysis remains anterior to this manifest level, which is that of the completed construction: in defining the principle of \ndistributing objects in a discourse, it does not take into account all their connexions, their delicate structure, or their \ninternal sub-divisions; in seeking the law of the dispersion of concepts, it does not take into account all the processes of \nelaboration, or all the deductive series in which they may figure; if analysis studies the modalities of enunciation, it \nquestions neither the style nor the succession. of the sentences; in short, it leaves the final placing of the text in dotted \nout-line. But we must be clear on one point: if analysis stands back in relation to this final construction, it is not to turn \naway from the discourse and to appeal to the silent work of thought; nor is it to turn away from the systematic and to \nreveal the 'living' disorder of attempts, trials, errors, and new beginnings. \n \nIn this respect, the analysis of discursive formations is opposed to many customary descriptions. One is used, in fact, to \nconsider that discourses and their systematic ordering are not only the ultimate state, the final result of a long and often \nsinuous development involving language (longue) and thought, empirical experience and categories, the lived and ideal \nnecessities, the contingency of events and the play of formal constraints. Behind the visible facade of the system, one \nposits the rich uncertainty of disorder; and beneath the thin surface of discourse, the whole mass of a largely silent \ndevelopment (devenir): a 'presystematic' that is not of the order of the system; a 'prediscursive' that belongs to an essential \nsilence. Discourse and system produce each other — and \n \n \n \n((85)) \nconjointly — only at the crest of this immense reserve. What are being analysed here are certainly \nnot the terminal states of discourse; they are the preterminal regularities in relation to which the \nultimate state, far from constituting the birth-place of a system, is defined by its variants. Behind \nthe completed system, what is discovered by the analysis of formations is not the bubbling source \nof life itself, life in an as yet uncaptured state; it is an immense density of systematicities, a tight \ngroup of multiple relations. Moreover, these relations cannot be the very web of the text — they are \nnot by nature foreign to discourse. They can certainly be qualified as 'prediscursive', but only if one \nadmits that this prediscursive is still discursive, that is, that they do not specify a thought, or a \nconsciousness, or a group of representations which, a posteriori, and in a way that is never quite \nnecessary, are transcribed into a discourse, but that they characterize certain levels of discourse, that \nthey define rules that are embodied as a particular practice by dis-course. One is not seeking, \ntherefore, to pass from the text to thought, from talk to silence, from the exterior to the interior, \nfrom spatial dispersion to the pure recollection of the moment, from superficial multiplicity to \nprofound unity.

DEFINING THE STATEMENT \nI suppose that by now we have accepted the risk; that we are now willing, in order to articulate the great surface of \ndiscourse, to posit the existence of those somewhat strange, somewhat distant figures that I have called discursive \nformations; that we have put to one side, not in a definitive way, but for a time and out of methodological rigour, the \ntraditional unities of the book and the ceuvre; that we have ceased to accept as a principle of unity the laws of \nconstructing discourse (wi.th the formal organization that results), or the situation of the speaking subject (with the \ncontext and the psychological nucleus that characterize it); that we no longer relate discourse to the primary ground of \nexperience, nor to the a priori authority of knowledge; but that we seek the rules of its formation in discourse itself. I \nsuppose that we have agreed to undertake these long inquiries into the system of emergence of objects, the system of the \nappearance and distribution of enunciative modes, the system of the placing and dispersion of concepts, the system of the \ndeployment of strategic choices. I suppose that we are willing to construct such abstract, problematic unities, instead of \nwelcoming those that presented themselves as being more or less perceptually familiar, if not as self-evident realities. \nBut what, in fact, have I been speaking about so far? What has been the object of my inquiry? And what did I intend to \ndescribe? \n \n \n((90)) \n'Statements' — both in that discontinuity that frees them from all the forms in which one was so ready to allow them to \nbe caught, and in the general, unlimited, apparently formless field of discourse. But I refrained from providing a \npreliminary definition of the statement. Nor did I try to construct one as I proceeded in order to justify the naivety of my \nstarting-point. Moreover — and this no doubt is the reason for so much unconcern — I wonder whether I have not \nchanged direction on the way; whether I have not replaced my first quest with another; whether, while analysing 'objects' \nor 'concepts', let alone 'strategies', I was in fact still speaking of statements; whether the four groups of rules by which I \ncharacterized a discursive formation really did define groups of statements. Lastly, instead of gradually reducing the \nrather fluctuating meaning of the word 'discourse', I believe that I have in fact added to its meanings: treating it \nsometimes as the general domain of all statements, sometimes as an individualizable group of statements, and sometimes \nas a regulated practice that accounts for a certain number of statements; and have I not allowed this same word \n'discourse', which should have served as a boundary around the term 'statement', to vary as I shifted my analysis or its \npoint of application, as the statement itself faded. from view? \nThis, then, is the task that now confronts me: to take up the definition of the statement at its very root. And to see \nwhether that definition really was present in my earlier descriptions; to see whether I really was dealing with the \nstatement in my analysis of discursive formations. \nOn several occasions I have used the term 'statement', either to speak of a population of statements (as if I were \ndealing with individuals or isolated events), or in order to distinguish it from the groups that I called 'discourses' (as the \npart is distinguished from the whole). At first sight, the statement appears as an ultimate, undecomposable element that \ncan be isolated and introduced into a set of relations with other similar elements. A point without a surface, but a point \nthat can be located in planes of division and in specific forms of groupings. A seed that appears on the surface of a tissue \nof which it is the constituent element. The atom of discourse. \nAnd the problem soon arises: if the statement really is the elementary unit of discourse, what does it consist of? What \n",

Is this unity identical with that to which logicians have given the term \n'proposition', and that which grammarians call a 'sentence', or that which 'analysts' try to map by the term 'speech act'? \nWhat place does it occupy among all those unities that the investigation of language (langage) has already revealed? \n(Even though the theory of these unities is so often incomplete, on account of the difficulty of the problems that they \npresent, and the difficulty in many cases of delimiting them with any degree of rigour.) \nI do not think that the necessary and sufficient condition of a state-ment is the presence of a defined propositional \nstructure, or that one can speak of a statement only when there is a proposition. In fact, one can have two perfectly \ndistinct statements, referring to quite different discursive groupings, when one finds only one proposition, possessing \nonly one value, obeying only one group of laws for its construction, and involving the same possibilities of use. 'No one \nheard' and 'It is true that no one heard' are indistinguishable from a logical point of view, and cannot be regarded as two \ndifferent propositions. But in so many statements, these two formations are not equivalent or inter-changeable. They \ncannot occupy the same place on the plane of dis-course, nor can they belong to exactly the same group of statements. If \none finds the formulation 'No one heard' in the first line of a novel, we know, until a new order emerges, that it is an \nobservation made either by the author, or by a character (aloud or in the form of an interior monologue); if one finds the \nsecond formulation, 'It is true that no one heard', one can only be in a group of statements constituting an interior \nmonologue, a silent discussion with. oneself, or a fragment of dialogue, a group of questions and answers. In each case, \nthere is the same propositional structure, but there are distinct enunciative characteristics. There may, on the other hand, \nbe complex and doubled propositional forms, or, on the contrary, fragmentary, incomplete propositions, when one is \nquite obviously dealing with a simple, complete, autonomous statement (even if it is part of group of other statements): \nthe example 'The present king of France is bald' is well known (it can be analysed from a logical point of view only if \non.e accepts, in the form of a single statement, two distinct propositions, each of which may be true or false on its own \naccount), or again there is a \n \n \n((92)) \nproposition like 'I am lying', which can be true only in relation to an assertion on a lower level. The criteria by which one \ncan define the identity of a proposition, distinguish several of them beneath the unity of a formulation, characterize its \nautonomy or its completion are not valid when one comes to describe the particular unity of a statement. \nAnd what of the sentence? Should we not accept an equivalence between sentence and statement? Wherever there is a \ngrammatically isolable sentence, one can recognize the existence of an independent statement; but, on the other hand, one \ncannot speak of statement when, beneath the sentence itself, one reaches the level of its constituents. It would he pointless \nto object, against such an equivalence, that some statements may be composed, outside the canonical form of subject-\ncopula-predicate, of a simple nominal syntagma ('That man!') or an adverb ('Absolutely'), or a personal pronoun ('You!'). \nFor the grammarians themselves recognize such formulations as independent sentences, even if those formulations have \nbeen obtained through a series of transformations on the basis of the subject-predicate schema. Moreover: they recognize \nas 'acceptable' sentences groups of linguistic elements that have not been correctly constructed, providing they are \ninterpretable; on the other hand, they accord the status of grammatical sentences to interpretable groups on condition \nhowever that they are correctly formed. With so broad — an.d, in a sense, so lax — a definition of the sentence, it is \ndifficult to see how one is to recognize sentences that are not statements, or statements that are not sentences. \nYet the equivalence is far from being a total one; and it is relatively easy to cite statements that do not correspond to \nthe linguistic structure of sentences. When one finds in a Latin grammar a series of words arranged in a column: amo, \namas, amat, one is dealing not with a sentence, but with the statement of the different personal inflexions of the present \nindicative of the verb amare. One may find this example debatable; one may say that it is a mere artifice of presentation, \nthat this statement is an elliptical, abbreviated sentence, spatialized in a relatively unusual mode, that should he read as \nthe sentence 'The present indicative of the verb amare is amo for the first person', etc. Other examples, in any case, are \nless ambiguous: a classificatory table of the botanical species is made up of statements, not sentences (Linnaeus's Genera \nPlantarum is a whole book of statements, in which one can recognize \n \n \n((93)) \nonly a small number of sentences); a genealogical tree, an accounts book, the calculations of a trade balance are \nstatements; where are the sentences? One can go further: an equation of the nth degree, or the algebraic formula of the \nlaw of refraction must be regarded as statements: and although they possess a highly rigorous grammaticality (since they \n",

Lastly, a graph, a growth curve, an age pyramid, a distribution \ncould are all statements: any sentences that may accompany them are merely interpretation or commentary; they are in no \nway an equivalent: this is proved by the fact that, in a great many cases, only an. infinite number of sentences could equal \nall the elements that are explicitly formulated in this sort of statement. It would not appear to be possible, therefore, to \ndefine a statement by the grammatical characteristics of the sentence. \nOne last possibility remains: at first sight, the most likely of all. Can one not say that there is a statement wherever one \ncan recognize and isolate an act of formulation — something like the speech act referred to by the English analysts? This \nterm does not, of course, refer to the material act of speaking (aloud or to oneself) or of writing (by hand or typewriter); \nnor does it refer to the intention of the individual who is speaking (the fact that he wants to convince someone else, to be \nobeyed, to discover the solution to a problem, or to communicate information) ; nor does it refer to the possible result of \nwhat he has said (whether he has convinced someone or aroused his suspicion; whether he was listened to and whether \nhis orders were carried out; whether his prayer was heard); what one is referring to is the operation that has been carried \nout by the formula itself, in its emergence: promise, order, decree, contract, agreement, observation. The speech act is not \nwhat took place just prior to the moment when the statement was made (in the author's thought or intentions); it is not \nwhat might have happened, after the event itself, in. its wake, and the consequences that it gave rise to; it is what occurred \nby the very fact that a statement was made — and precisely this statement (and no other) in specific circumstances. \nPresumably, therefore, one individualization of statements \n \n \n((94)) \nrefers to the same criteria as the location of acts of formulation: each act is embodied in a statement each statement \ncontains one of those acts. They exist through one another in an exact reciprocal relationship. \nYet such a correlation does not stand up to examination. For one thing, more than a statement is often required to \neffect a speech act: an oath, a prayer, a contract, a promise, or a demonstration usually require a certain number of distinct \nformulas or separate sentences: it would be difficult to challenge the right of each of these formulas and sentences to be \nregarded as a statement on the pretext that they are all imbued with one and the same speech act. In that case, it might be \nsaid that the act itself does not remain the same throughout the series of statements; that in a prayer there are as many \nlimited, successive, and juxtaposed acts of prayer as demands formulated by distinct statements; and that in a promise \nthere are as many engagements as sequences that can be individualized into separate statements. But one cannot be \nsatisfied with this answer: first because the act of formulation would no longer serve to define the statement, but, on the \ncontrary, the act of formula-tion would be defined by the statement — which raises problems, and requires criteria of \nindividualization. Moreover, certain speech acts can be regarded as complete in their particular unity only if several state-\nments have been made, each in its proper place. These acts are not constituted, therefore, by the series or sum of these \nstatements, by their necessary juxtaposition; they cannot be regarded as being present whole and entire in the least of \nthem, and as renewing themselves with each one. So one cannot establish a hi-univocal relation between the group of \nstatements and that of speech acts either. \nWhen one wishes to individualize statements, one cannot therefore accept unreservedly any of the models borrowed \nfrom grammar, logic, or 'analysis'. In all three cases, one realizes that the criteria proposed are too numerous and too \nheavy, that they limit the extent of the statement, and that although the statement sometimes takes on the forms described \nand adjusts itself to them exactly, it does not always do so: one finds statements lacking in legitimate propositional \nstructure; one finds statements where one cannot recognize a sentence; one finds more statements that one can isolate \nspeech acts. As if the statement were more tenuous, less charged with determinations, less strongly structured, more \nomnipresent, too, than all these figures; as if it had \n \n \n((95)) \nfewer features, and ones less difficult to group together; but as if, by that very fact, it rejected all possibility of describing \nanything. And this is all the more so, in that it is difficult to see at what level it should be situated, and by what method it \nshould be approached: for all the analyses mentioned above, there is never more than a support, or accidental substance: \nin logical analysis, it is what is left when the propositional structure has been extracted and defined; for grammatical \nanalysis, it is the series of linguistic elements in which one may or may not recognize the form of a sentence; for the \nanalysis of speech acts, it appears as the visible body in which they manifest themselves. In relation to all these \ndescriptive approaches, it plays the role of a residual element, of a mere fact, of irrelevant raw material. \n",

But is it enough, then, that the signs of a \nlanguage constitute a statement, if they were produced (articulated, drawn, made, traced) in one way or another, if they \nappeared in a moment of time and in a point in space, if the voice that spoke them or the gesture that formed them gave \nthem the dimensions of a material existence? Can the letters of the alphabet written by me haphazardly on to a sheet of \npaper, as an example of what is not a statement, can the lead characters used for printing books — and one cannot deny \ntheir materiality, which has space and volume — can these signs, spread out, visible, manipulable, be reasonably regarded \nas statements? \nWhen looked at more closely, however, these two examples (the lead characters and the signs that I wrote down on the \nsheet of paper) are seen to be not quite superposable. This pile of printer's characters, which I can hold in my hand, or the \nletters marked on the keyboard of a typewriter are not statements: at most they are tools with which one can write \nstatements. On the other hand, what are the letters that I write down haphazardly on to a sheet of paper, just as they come \nto mind, and to show that they cannot, in their disordered state, constitute a statement? What figure do they form? Are \nthey not a table of letters chosen in a contingent way, the statement of an alphabetical series governed by other laws than \nthose of chance? Similarly, the table of random numbers that statisticians sometimes use is a series of numerical symbols \nthat are not linked together by any syntactical structure; and yet that series is a statement: that of a group of figures \nobtained by procedures that eliminate everything that might increase the prob-ability of the succeeding issues. Let us look \nat the example again: the keyboard of a typewriter is not a statement; but the same series of letters, A, Z, E, R, T, listed in \na typewriting manual, is the statement of the alphabetical order adopted by French typewriters. So we are \n \n \n((97)) \npresented with a number of negative consequences: a regular linguistic construction is not required in order to form a \nstatement (this state-ment may be made up of a series possessing a minimal probability) ; but neither is it enough to have \nany material effectuation of linguistic elements, any emergence of signs in time and space, for a statement to appear and \nto begin to exist. The statement exists therefore neither in the same way as a language (longue) (although it is made up of \nsigns that are definable in their individuality only within a natural or artificial linguistic system), nor in the same way as \nthe object presented to perception (although it is always endowed with a certain materiality, and can always he situated in \naccordance with spatio-temporal coordinates). \nThis is not the place to answer the general question of the statement, but the problem can be clarified: the statement is \nnot the same kind of unit as the sentence, the proposition, or the speech act; it cannot be referred therefore to the same \ncriteria; but neither is it the same kind of unit as a material object, with its limits and independence. In its way of being \nunique (neither entirely linguistic, nor exclusively material), it is indispensable if we want to say whether or not there is a \nsentence, proposition, or speech act; and whether the sentence is correct (or acceptable, or interpretable), whether the \nproposition is legitimate and well constructed, whether the speech act fulfils its requirements, and was in fact carried out. \n",

This answer is inadequate for two reasons: it is not \nenough that the reiteration of a series be due to the initiative of an individual for it to be transformed, by that very fact, \ninto a state-ment; and, in any case, the problem does not lie in the cause or origin of the reduplication, but in the special \nrelation between the two identical series. The second series is not a statement because and only because a hi-univocal \nrelation can be established between each of its elements in the first series (this relation characterizes either the fact of \nduplication if it is simply a copy, or the exactitude of the statement if one has in fact crossed the threshold of \nenunciation; but it does not allow us to define this threshold and the very fact of the statement).

It is a very special relation: and if in these conditions an identical formulation reappears, with the same words, \nsubstantially the same names — in fact, exactly the same sentence — it is not necessarily the same statement. \nNor should the relation between a statement and what it states be confused with the relation between a proposition and \nits referent. We know that logicians say that a proposition like The golden mountain is in California' cannot be verified \nbecause it has no referent: its negation is therefore neither more nor less true than its affirmation. Should we say similarly \nthat a statement refers to nothing if the proposition, to which it lends existence, has no referent? Rather the reverse. We \nshould say not that the absence of a referent brings with it the absence of a correlate for the statement, but that it is the \ncorrelate of the statement — that to which it refers, not only what is said, but also what it speaks of, its 'theme' — which \nmakes it possible to say whether or not the proposition has a referent: it alone decides this in a definitive way. Let us \nsuppose in fact that the formulation 'The golden mountain is in California' is found not in a geography book, nor in a \ntravel book, but in a novel, or in some fictional context or other, one could still accord it a value of truth or error \n(according to whether the imaginary world to which it refers does or does not authorize such a geological and geo-\ngraphical fantasy). We must know to what the statement refers, what is its space of correlations, if we are to say whether \na proposition has or has not a referent. 'The present king of France is bald' lacks a referent only if one supposes that the \nstatement refers to the world of con-temporary historical information. The relation of the proposition to the referent \ncannot serve as a model or as a law for the relation of the statement to what it states. The latter relation not only does not \nbelong to the same level as the former, but it is anterior to it. \nNor is it superposable to the relation that may exist between a sentence and its meaning. The gap between these two \nforms of relation appears clearly in the case of two famous sentences that are meaning-less, in spite of their perfectly \ncorrect grammatical structure (as in the example: 'Colourless green ideas sleep furiously'). In fact, to say that a sentence \nlike this is meaningless presupposes that one has already excluded a number of possibilities — that it describes a dream, \nthat it is part of a poetic text, that it is a coded message, that it is spoken by a \n((102)) \ndrug addict — and that one assumes it to be a certain type of statements that must refer, in a very definite way, to some \nvisible reality. The relation of a sentence with its meaning resides within a specific, well-stabilized enunciative relation. \nMoreover, even if these sentences are taken at an enunciative level at which they are meaningless, they are not, as \nstatements, deprived of correlations: there are those that enable one to say, for example, that ideas are never either \ncoloured or colour-less, and therefore that the sentence is meaningless (and these correlations concern a level of reality in \nwhich ideas are invisible, and in which colours can he seen, etc.); there are also those correlations that validate the \nsentence in question as a mention of a type of correct syntactical organization that was also meaningless (and these \ncorrelations concern the level of the language (langue), with its laws and properties). A sentence cannot be non-\nsignificant; it refers to something, by virtue of the fact that it is a statement. \nHow, then, can we define this relation that characterizes the state-ment as statement — a relation that seems to be \nimplicitly presupposed by the sentence or the proposition, and which is anterior to it? How can we disentangle it from \nthose relations of meaning or those values of truth, with which it is usually confused? Any statement, as simple a \nstatement as one can imagine, does not have as its correlate an individual or a particular object that is designated by this \nor that word in the sentence: in the case of a statement like `The golden mountain is in California', the correlate is not the \nformation, real or imaginary, possible or absurd, that is designated by the nominal syntagma that serves as the subject. \nBut nor is the correlate of the statement a state of things or a relation capable of verifying the proposition (in the example \nchosen, this would be the spatial inclusion of a particular mountain in a particular region). On the other hand, what might \nhe defined as the correlate of the statement is a group of domains in which such objects may appear and to which such \nrelations may be assigned: it would, for example, be a domain of material objects possessing a certain number of \nobservable physical properties, relations of perceptible size — or, on the contrary, it would he domain of fictitious \nobjects, endowed with arbitrary properties (even if they have a certain constancy and a certain coherence), without any \nauthority of experimental or perceptive verification; it would be a domain of spatial and geographical localizations, \n \n \n((103)) \nwith coordinates, distances, relations of proximity and of inclusion — or, on the contrary, a domain of symbolic \nappurtenances and secret kinships; it would be a domain of objects that exist at the same moment and on the same time-\nscale as the statement is formulated, or it would be a domain of objects that belongs to a quite different present — that \nindicated and constituted by the statement itself, and not that to which the statement also belongs. A statement is not \nconfronted (face to face, as it were) by a correlate — or the absence of a correlate — as a proposition has (or has not) a \nreferent, or as a proper noun designates someone (or no one). It is linked rather to a 'referential' that is made up not of \n'things', 'facts', 'realities', or 'beings', but of laws of possibility, rules of existence for the objects that are named, \ndesignated, or described within it, and for the relations that are affirmed or denied in it. The referential of the statement \nforms the place, the condition, the field of emergence, the authority to differentiate between individuals or objects, states \n",

It is this group that \ncharacterizes the enunciative level of the formulation, in contrast to its grammatical and logical levels: through the \nrelation with these various domains of possibility the statement makes of a syntagma, or a series of symbols, a sentence to \nwhich one may or may not ascribe a meaning, a proposition that may or may not be accorded a value as truth. \nOne can see in any case that the description of this enunciative level can be performed neither by a formal analysis, \nnor by a semantic investigation, nor by verification, but by the analysis of the relations between the statement and the \nspaces of differentiation, in which the statement itself reveals the differences. \n \n(b) A statement also differs from any series of linguistic elements by virtue of the fact that it possesses a particular \nrelation with a subject. We must now define the nature of this relation, and, above all, distinguish it from other relations \nwith which it might be confused. \nWe must not, in fact, reduce the subject of the statement to the first-person grammatical elements that are present \nwithin the sentence. First because the subject of th.e sentence is not within the linguistic \n \n \n((104)) \nsyntagma; secondly because a statement that does not involve a first person nevertheless has a subject; lastly and above \nall, all statements that have a fixed grammatical form (whether in the first or second person) do not have the same type \nof relation with the subject of the statement. It is easy to see that this relation is not the same in a state-ment of the type \n'Night is falling', and 'Every effect has a cause'; while in the case of a statement of the type 'Longtemps, je me Buis \ncouche de bonne heure' ('For a long time I used to go to bed early'), the relation to the enunciating subject is not the same \nif one hears it spoken in the course of a conversation, and if one reads it at the beginning of Proust's A la Recherche du \ntemps perdu. \nIs not this subject exterior to the sentence quite simply the individual who spoke or wrote those words? As we know, \nthere can be no signs without someone, or at least something, to emit them. For a series of signs to exist, there must — \nin accordance with the system of causality — be an 'author' or a transmitting authority. But this `author' is not identical \nwith the subject of the statement; and the relation of production that he has with the formulation is not superposable to \nthe relation that unites the enunciating subject and what he states. Let us ignore the over-simple case of a group of signs \nthat have been materially fashioned or traced: their production implies an author even though there is neither a statement \nnor a subject of a statement. One might also mention, by way of showing the dissociation between the transmitter of \nsigns and the subject of a statement, the case of a text read by a third person, or that of an actor speaking his part. But \nthese are extreme cases. Generally speaking, it would seem, at first sight at least, that the subject of the statement is \nprecisely he who has produced the various elements, with the intention of conveying meaning. Yet things are not so \nsimple. In a novel, we know that the author of the formulation is that real individual whose name appears on the title \npage of the book (we are still faced with the problem of the dialogue, and sentences purporting to express the thoughts of \na character; we are still faced with the problem of texts published under a pseudonym: and we know all the difficulties \nthat these duplications raise for practitioners of interpretative analysis when they wish to relate these formulations, en \nbloc, to the author of the text, to what he wanted to say, to what he thought, in short, to that great silent, hidden, uniform \n \n \n((105)) \ndiscourse on which they build that whole pyramid of different levels); but, even apart from those authorities of \nformulation that are not identical with the individual/author, the statements of the novel do not have the same subject \nwhen they provide, as if from the outside, the historical and spatial setting of th.e story, when they describe things as they \nwould be seen by an anonymous, invisible, neutral individual who moves magically among the characters of the novel, or \nwhen they provide, as if by an immediate, internal decipherment, the verbal version of what is silently experienced by a \ncharacter. Although the author is the same in each case, although he attributes them to no one other than himself, \nalthough he does not invent a supplementary link between what he is himself and the text that one is reading, these \nstatements do not presuppose the same characteristics for the enunciating subject; they do not imply the same relation \nbetween this subject and what is being stated. \nIt might be said that the often quoted example of the fictional text has no conclusive validity; or rather that it questions \nthe very essence of literature, and not the status the subject of statements in general. According to this view, it is in the \nnature of literature that the author should appear to be absent, conceal himself within it, delegate his authority, or divide \nhimself up; and one should not draw a general conclusion from this dissociation that the subject of the statement is \ndistinct in everything — in nature, status, function, and identity — from the author of the formulation. Yet this gap is not \nconfined to literature alone. It is absolutely general in so far as the subject of the statement is a particular function, but is \nnot necessarily the same from one state-ment to another; in so far as it is an empty function, that can be filled by virtually \nany individual when he formulates the statement; and in so far as one and the same individual may occupy in turn, in the \nsame series of statements, different positions, and assume the role of different subjects.

In the sentence in the preface in which one explains why this treatise was written, in what \ncircumstances, in response to what unsolved problems, or with what pedagogical aim in view, using what methods, after \nwhat attempts and failures, the position of the enunciative subject can be occupied only by the author, or authors, of the \nformulation: the conditions of individualization of the subject are in fact very strict, very \n \n \n((106)) \nnumerous, and authorize in this case only one possible subject. On the other hand, if in the main body of the treatise, one \nmeets a proposition like 'Two quantities equal to a third quantity are equal to each other', the subject of the statement is \nthe absolutely neutral position, indifferent to time, space, and circumstances, identical in any linguistic system, and in any \ncode of writing or symbolization, that any individual may occupy when affirming such a proposition. Moreover, \nsentences like 'We have already shown that . . .' necessarily involve statements of precise contextual conditions that were \nnot implied by the preceding formulation: the position is then fixed within a domain constituted by a finite group of \nstatements; it is localized in a series of enunciative events that must already have occurred; it is established in a \ndemonstrative time whose earlier stages are never lost, and which do not need therefore to be begun again and repeated \nidentically to be made present once more (a mention is enough to reactivate them in their original validity); it is \ndetermined by the prior existence of a number of effective operations that need not have been performed by one and the \nsame individual (he who is speaking now), but which rightfully belong to the enunciating subject, which are at his \ndisposal, and of which he may avail himself when necessary. The subject of such a statement will be defined by these \nrequisites and possibilities taken together; and he will not be described as an individual who has really carried out certain \noperations, who lives in an unbroken, never forgot-ten time, who has interiorized, in the horizon of his consciousness, a \nwhole group of true propositions, and who retains, in the living present of his thought, their potential reappearance (this is \nmerely, in the case of individuals, the psychological, 'lived' aspect of their position as enunciating subjects). \nSimilarly, one might describe the specific position of the enunciating subject in sentences like 'I call straight any series \nof points that .. or 'Let there be a finite series of any elements'; in each case the position of the subject is linked to the \nexistence of an operation that is both determined and present; in each case, the subject of the statement is also the subject \nof the operation (he who establishes the definition of a straight line is also he who states it; he who posits the existence of \na finite series is also, and at the same time, he who states it); and in each case, the subject links, by means of this \noperation and the statement in \n \n \n((107)) \nwhich it is embodied, his statement as his own law). There is a difference however: in the first case, what is stated is a \nconvention of language (langage) — of that language that the enunciating subject must use, and within. which he is \ndefined: the enunciating subject and what is stated are therefore at the same level (whereas for a formal analysis a \nstatement like this one implies the difference of level proper to meta-language); in the second case, on the other hand, the \nenunciating subject brings into existence outside himself an object that belongs to a previously defined domain, whose \nlaws of possibility have already been articulated, and whose characteristics precede the enunciation that posits it. We saw \nabove that the position of the enunciating subject is not always identical in the affirmation of a true proposition; we now \nsee that it is also not identical when an operation is carried out within the statement itself. \nSo the subject of the statement should not he regarded as identical with the author of the formulation — either in \nsubstance, or in function. He is not in fact the cause, origin, or starting-point of the phenomenon of the written or spoken \narticulation of a sentence; nor is it that meaningful intention which, silently anticipating words, orders them like the \nvisible body of its intuition; it is not the constant, motionless, unchanging focus of a series of operations that are \nmanifested, in turn, on the surface of discourse through the statements. It is a particular, vacant place that may in fact be \nfilled by different individuals; but, instead of being defined once and for all, and maintaining itself as such throughout a \ntext, a book, or an oeuvre, this place varies — or rather i.t is variable enough to he able either to persevere, unchanging, \nthrough several sentences, or to alter with each one. It is a dimension that characterizes a whole formulation qua \nstatement. It is one of the characteristics proper to the enunciative function and enables one to describe it. If a proposition, \na sentence, a group of signs can be called `state-ment', it is not therefore because, one day, someone happened to speak \nthem or put them into some concrete form of writing; it is because the position of the subject can be assigned. To describe \na formulation qua statement does not consist in analysing the relations between the author and what he says (or wanted to \nsay, or said without wanting to) ; but in determining what position can and must be occupied by any individual if he is to \nbe the subject of it. \n \n \n((108)) \n \n",

This makes the statement something other, something more, than a mere collection of signs, which, in \norder to exist, need only a material base — a writing surface, sound, malleable material, the hollowed incision of a \ntrace. But this also, and above all, distinguishes it from the sentence and the proposition. \nTake a group of words or symbols. In order to decide whether they constitute a grammatical unit like the \nsentence or a logical unit like the proposition, it is necessary, and enough, to determine the rules accord-ing to \nwhich it was constructed. 'Peter arrived yesterday' forms a sentence, but 'Yesterday arrived Peter' does not; A + B = \nC + D constitutes a proposition, but ABC + = D does not. Only an examination of the elements and of their \ndistribution, in reference to the system — natural or artificial — of the language (longue) enables us to distinguish \nbetween what is and what is not a proposition, between what is a sentence and what is merely an accumulation of \nwords. Moreover, this examination is enough to determine to what type of grammatical structure the sentence in \nquestion belongs (affirmative sentence, in the past tense, containing a nominal subject, etc.), or to what type of \nproposition the series of signs in question belongs (an equivalence between two additions). One can even conceive \nof a sentence or a proposition that is 'self-determining', that requires no other sentence or proposition to serve as a \ncontext, no other associated sentences or propositions: that such a sentence or proposition would, in such \nconditions, be useless and unusable, does not mean that one would not be able to recognize it, even in its \nsingularity. \nOne could no doubt make a number of objections to this. One might say, for example, that a proposition can be \nestablished and individualized as such only if one knows the system of axioms that it obeys; do not those \ndefinitions, those rules, those conventions of writing form an associated field inseparable from the proposition \n(similarly, the rules of grammar, implicitly at work in the competence of the subject, are necessary if one is to \nrecognize a sentence, and a sentence of a certain type)? It should be noted however that this group — actual or \npotential — does not belong to the same level as the proposition or the sentence: but that it has a bearing on their \npossible elements, succession, and \n \n((109)) \ndistribution. The group is not associated with them: it is presupposed by them. One might also object that many (non-\ntautological.) propositions cannot be verified on the basis of their rules of construction alone, and that recourse to the \nreferent is needed if one is to decide whether they are true or false: but true or false, a proposition. remains a proposition, \nand it is not recourse to the referent that decides whether or not it is a proposition. The same goes for sentences; in many \ncases, they can yield their meaning only in relation to the context (whether they contain `deictic' elements that refer to a \nconcrete situation; or make use of first — or second-person pronouns that designate the speaking subject and hi.s \ninterlocutors; or make use of pronominal elements or connecting particles that refer to earlier or later sentences); but the \nfact that its meaning cannot be completed does not prevent the sentence from being grammatically complete and \nautonomous. Certainly, one is not very sure what a group of words like 'I'll tell you that tomorrow' means; in any case, \none can neither date this 'tomorrow', nor name the interlocutors, nor guess what is to be said. Nevertheless, it is a \nperfectly delimited sentence, obeying the rules of construction of the language (longue) in which it is written. Lastly, one \nmight object that, without a context, it is sometimes difficult to define the structure of a sentence ('I shall never know if \nh.e is dead' may be construed: 'I shall never know whether or n.ot he is dead' or 'I shall never be informed of his death \nwhen this even occurs'). But this ambiguity is perfectly definable, simultaneous possibilities can be posited that belong to \nthe structure proper of the sentence. Generally speaking, one can say that a sentence or a proposition — even when \nisolated, even divorced from the natural context that could throw light on to its meaning, even. freed or cut off from all \nthe elements to which, implicitly or not, it refers — always remains a sentence or a proposition and can. always be \nrecognized as such. \nOn the other hand, the enunciative function — and this shows that it is not simply a construction of previously existing \nelements — cannot operate on a sentence or proposition in isolation. It is not enough to say a sentence, i.t is not even \nenough to say it in a particular relation to a field of objects or in a particular relation to a subject, for a statement to exist: \nit must be related to a whole adjacent field.

A \nstatement always has borders peopled by other statements. These borders are not what is usually meant by 'context' — \nreal or verbal — that is, all the situational or linguistic elements, taken together, that motivate a formulation and \ndetermine its meaning. They are distinct from such a 'context' precisely in so far as they make it possible: the contextual \nrelation between one sentence and those before an.d after it is not the same in the case of a novel and in that of a treatise \nin physics; the contextual relation between a formulation and the objective environment is not the same in a conversation \nand in the account of an experiment. It is against the background of a more general relation between the formulations, \nagainst the background of a whole verbal network, that the effect of context may he determined. Nor are these borders \nidentical with the various texts and sentences that the subject may be conscious of when he speaks; again they are more \nextensive than such a psychological setting; and to a certain extent they determine that setting, for accord-ing to the \nposition, status, and role of one formulation among others — according to whether it belongs to the field of literature or \nas an isolated remark, whether it is part of a narrative or the account of a demonstration — the way in which other \nstatements are present in the mind of the subject will not he the same: neither the same level, nor the same form of \nlinguistic experience, of verbal memory, of reference to what has already been said, is operating in each case. The \npsychological halo of a formulation is controlled from afar by the arrangement of the enunciative field. \nThe associated field that turns a sentence or a series of signs into a statement, and which provides them with a \nparticular context, a specific representative content, forms a complex web. It is made up first of all by the series of other \nformulations within which the statement appears and forms one element (the network of spoken formulations that make \nup a conversation, the architecture of a demonstration, hound on the one side by its premises and on the other by its \nconclusion, the series of affirmations that make up a narrative). The associated field is also made up of all the \nformulations to which the statement refers (implicitly or not), either by repeating them, modifying them, or adapting \nthem, or by opposing them, or by commenting on them; \n \n \n((111)) \n \nthere can be no statement that in one way or another does not reactualize others (ritual elements in a narrative; \npreviously accepted propositions in a demonstration; conventional sentences in a conversation). The associated field is \nalso made up of all the formulations whose subsequent possibility is determined by the statement, and which may follow \nthe statement as its consequence, its natural successor, or its conversational retort (an order does not open up the same \nenunciative possibilities as the propositions of an axiomatic or the beginning of a narrative). Lastly, the associated field \nis made up of all the formulations whose status the statement in question shares, among which it takes its place without \nregard to linear order, with which it will fade away, or with which, on the contrary, it will be valued, preserved, \nsacralized, and offered, as a possible object, to a future discourse (a statement is not dissociable from the status that it \nmay receive as `literature', or as an unimportant remark that is barely worthy of being forgotten, or as a scientific truth \nvalid for all time, or as prophetic words, etc.). Generally speaking, one can say that a sequence of linguistic elements is a \nstate-ment only if it is immersed in an enunciative field, in which it then appears as a unique element. \nThe statement is not the direct projection on to the plane of language (langage) of a particular situation or a group of \nrepresentations. It is not simply the manipulation by a speaking subject of a number of elements and linguistic rules. At \nthe very outset, from the very root, the state-ment is divided up into an enunciative field in which it has a place and a \nstatus, which arranges for its possible relations with the past, and which opens up for it a possible future. Every \nstatement is specified in this way: there is no statement in general, no free, neutral, independent statement; but a \nstatement always belongs to a series or a whole, always plays a role among other statements, deriving support from them \nand distinguishing itself from them: it is always part of a network of statements, in which it has a role, however minimal \nit may be, to play. Whereas grammatical construction needs only elements and rules in order to operate; whereas one \nmight just conceive of a language (longue) — an artificial one, of course — whose only purpose is the construction of a \nsingle sentence; whereas the alphabet, the rules of construction and trans-formation of a formal system being given, one \ncan perfectly well \n \n \n((112)) \ndefine the first proposition of this language (langage), the same can-not be said of the statement. There is no statement \nthat does not presuppose others; there is no statement that is not surrounded by a field of coexistences, effects of series \nand succession, a distribution of functions and roles. If one can speak of a statement, it is because a sentence (a \nproposition) figures at a definite point, with a specific position, in an enunciative network that extends beyond it. \n",

    "chunk_full": "Against this background of enunciative coexistence, there stand out, at an autonomous and describable level, the \ngrammatical relations between sentences, the logical relations between propositions, the metalinguistic relations between \nan object language and one that defines the rules, the rhetorical relations between groups (or elements) of sentences. It is \npermissible, of course, to analyse all these relations without taking as one's theme the enunciative field itself, that is, the \ndomain of coexistence in which the enunciative function operates. But they can exist and are analysable only to the extent \nthat these sentences have been 'enunciated'; in other words, to the extent that they are deployed in an enunciative field that \nallows them to follow one another, order one another, coexist with one another, and play roles in relation to one another. \nFar from being the principle of individualization of groups of 'signifiers' (the meaningful `atom', the minimum on the \nbasis of which there is meaning), the statement is that which situates these meaningful units in a space in which they \nbreed and multiply. \n \n(d) Lastly, for a sequence of linguistic elements to be regarded and analysed as a statement, it must fulfil a fourth \ncondition: it must have a material existence. Could one speak of a statement if a voice had not articulated it, if a surface \ndid not bear its signs, if it had not become embodied in a sense-perceptible element, and if it had not left some trace — if \nonly for an instant — in someone's memory or in some space? Could one speak of a statement as an ideal, silent figure? \nThe statement is always given through some material medium, even if that medium is concealed, even if it is doomed to \nvanish as soon as it appears. And the statement not only needs this materiality; its materiality is not given to it, in \naddition, once all its determinations have been fixed: it is partly made up of this materiality. Even if a sentence is \ncomposed of the same \n \n \n((113)) \nwords, bears exactly the same meaning, and preserves the same syn-tactical and semantic identity, it does not constitute \nthe same statement if it is spoken by someone in the course of a conversation, or printed in a novel; if it was written one \nday centuries ago, and if it now reappears in an oral formulation. The coordinates and the material status of the statement \nare part of its intrinsic characteristics. That is an obvious fact. Or almost. For as soon as one examines it a little more \nclosely, things begin to blur and the problems increase. \nOf course, it is tempting to say that if a statement is characterized, partly at least, by its material status, and if its \nidentity is susceptible to a modification of that status, the same can be said of sentences and propositions: the materiality \nof signs is not, in fact, entirely indifferent to grammar or even to logic. We know what theoretical problems are presented \nto logic by the material constancy of the symbols used (how to define the identity of a symbol through the various \nsubstances in which it may be embodied and the variations of form that it can tolerate? How to recognize it and make \ncertain that it is the same, if it must be defined as 'a concrete physical form?'); we know too what problems are presented \nto logic by the very notion of a series of sym-bols (what do 'precede' and 'follow' mean? Come 'before' and 'after'? In what \nspace is such an order situated?). Much better known still are the relations of materiality and the language (longue) — the \nrole of writ-ing and the alphabet, the fact that neither the same syntax, nor the same vocabulary operate in a written text \nand in a conversation, in a news-paper and in a book, in a letter and on a poster; moreover, there are series of words that \nform perfectly individualized and acceptable sentences if they feature as newspaper headlines, and which, nevertheless, in \nthe course of a conversation, could never stand as meaningful sentences. Yet the materiality plays a much more important \nrole in the statement: it is not simply a principle of variation, a modification of the criteria of recognition, or a \ndetermination of linguistic sub-groups. It is constitutive of the statement itself: a statement must have a substance, a \nsupport, a place, and a date. And when these requisites change, it too changes identity. At this point, a host of questions \narises: Does the same sentence repeated very loudly and very softly form one or more statements? When one learns a text \nby heart, does each recitation constitute a statement, or should one regard it as a repetition of the same \n \n \n((114)) \n \n \nstatement? A sentence is faithfully translated into a foreign language: two distinct statements or one? And in a collective \nrecitation — a prayer or a lesson — how many statements are produced? How can one establish the identity of the \nstatement through all these various forms, repetitions, and transcriptions? \nThe problem is no doubt obscured by the fact that there is often a confusion of different levels. To begin with, we \nmust set aside the multiplicity of enunciations. We will say that an enunciation takes place whenever a group of signs is \nemitted. Each of these articulations has its spatiotemporal individuality. Two people may say the same thing at the same \ntime, but since there are two people there will he two distinct enunciations. The same person may repeat the same \nsentence several times; this will produce the same number of enunciations distinct in time. The enunciation is an \nunrepeatable event; it has a situated and dated uniqueness that is irreducible. Yet this uniqueness allows of a number of \nconstants — grammatical, semantic, logical — by which one can, by neutralizing the moment of enunciation and the \ncoordinates that individualize it, recognize the general form of a sentence, a mean-ing, a proposition. The time and place \nof the enunciation, and the material support that it uses, then become, very largely at least, indifferent: and what stands \n",

But the state-ment \nitself cannot be reduced to this pure event of enunciation, for, despite its materiality, it cannot be repeated: it would not \nbe difficult to say that the same sentence spoken by two people in slightly different circumstances constitute only one \nstatement. And yet the statement cannot he reduced to a grammatical or logical form because, to a greater degree than \nthat form, and in a different way, it is susceptible to differences of material, substance, time, and place. What, then, is \nthat materiality proper to the statement, and which permits certain special types of repetition? How is it that one can \nspeak of the same statement when there are several distinct enunciations of it, yet must speak of several statements when \none can recognize identical forms, structures, rules of construction, and intentions? What, then, is this rule of repeatable \nmateriality that characterizes the statement? \nThis may not he a perceptible, qualitative materiality, expressed in the form of colour, sound, or solidity, and divided \nup by the same \n \n \n((115)) \nspatiotemporal observation as the perceptual space. Let us take a very simple example: a text reproduced several times, \nthe successive editions of a book, or, better still, the different copies of the same printing, do not give rise to the same \nnumber of distinct statements: in all the editions of Les Fleurs du mal (variants and rejected versions apart) , we find the \nsame set of statements; yet neither the characters, nor the ink, nor the paper, nor even the placing of the text and the \npositions of the signs, are the same: the whole texture of the materiality has changed. But in this case these 'small' \ndifferences are not important enough to alter the identity of the statement and to bring about another: they are all \nneutralized in the general element — material, of course, but also institutional and economic — of the 'book': a book, \nhowever many copies or editions are made of it, however many different substances it may use, is a locus of exact \nequivalence for the statements — for them it is an authority that permits repetition without any change of identity. We \nsee from this first example that the materiality of the statement is not defined by the space occupied or the date of its \nformulation; but rather by its status as a thing or object. A status that is never definitive, but modifiable, relative, and \nalways susceptible of being questioned: we know for example that, for literary historians, the edition of a book published \nwith the agreement of the author does not have the same status as posthumous editions, that the statements in it have a \nunique value, that they are not one of the manifestations of one and the same whole, that they are that by relation to \nwhich there is and must be repetition. Similarly, between the text of a Constitution, or a will, or a religious revelation, \nand all the manuscripts or printed copies that reproduce them exactly, with the same writing, in the same characters, and \non similar substances, one cannot say that there is an equivalence: on the one hand there are the statements themselves, \nand on the other their reproduction. The statement cannot be identified with a fragment of matter; but its identity varies \nwith a complex set of material institutions. \nFor a statement may be the same, whether written on a sheet of paper or published in a book; it may be the same \nspoken, printed on a poster, or reproduced on a tape-recorder; on the other hand, when a novelist speaks a sentence in \ndaily life, then reproduces the same sentence in the manuscript that he is writing, attributing it to one of his \n \n \n((116)) \ncharacters, or even allowing it to be spoken by that anonymous voice that passes for that of the author, one cannot say \nthat it is the same statement in each case. The rule of materiality that statements necessarily obey is therefore of the order \nof the institution rather than of the spatio-temporal localization; it defines possibilities of reinscription and transcription \n(hut also thresholds and limits), rather than limited and perishable individualities. \nThe identity of a statement is subjected to a second group of conditions and limits: those that are imposed by all the \nother statements among which it figures, by the domain in which it can be used or applied, by the role and functions that \nit can perform. The affirmation that the earth is round or that species evolve does not constitute the same statement before \nand after Copernicus, before and after Darwin; it is not, for such simple formulations, that the meaning of the words has \nchanged; what changed was the relation of these affirmations to other propositions, their conditions of use and \nreinvestment, the field of experience, of possible verifications, of problems to be resolved, to which they can be referred. \nThe sentence 'dreams fulfil desires' may have been repeated throughout the centuries; it is not the same state-ment in \nPlato and in Freud. The schemata of use, the rules of application, the constellations in which. they can play a part, their \nstrategic potentialities constitute for statements a field of stabilization that makes it possible, despite all the differences of \nenunciation, to repeat them in their identity; but this same field may also, beneath the most manifest semantic, \ngrammatical, or formal identities, define a threshold beyond which there can be no further equivalence, and the appear-\nance of a new statement must be recognized. But it is possible, no doubt, to go further: there are cases in which one may \nconsider that there is only one statement, even though the words, the syntax, and the language (langue) itself are not \nidentical. Such cases are a speech and its simultaneous translation; a scientific text in English and its French version; a \nnotice printed in three columns in three different languages: there are not, in such cases, the same number of statements as \nthere are languages used, but a single group of statements in different linguistic forms. Better still: a given piece of \ninformation may be retransmitted with other words, with a simplified syntax, or in an agreed code; if the information \ncontent and the uses to which it \n \n",

Moreover, not only can this identity of the statement \nnot be situated once and for all in relation to that of the sentence, but it is itself relative and oscillates according to the use \nthat is made of the statement and the way in which it is handled. When one uses a statement in such a way as to reveal its \ngrammatical structure, its rhetorical configuration, or the connotations that it may carry, it is obvious that one cannot \nregard it as being identical in its original language (longue) and in a translation. On the other hand, if it is intended as part \nof a procedure of experimental verification, then text and translation constitute a single enunciative whole. Or again, at a \ncertain scale of macro-history, one may consider that an affirmation like 'species evolve' forms the same statement in \nDarwin and in Simpson; at a finer level, and considering more limited fields of use ('neo-Darwinism' as opposed to the \nDarwinian system itself), we are presented with two different statements. The constancy of the statement, the preservation \nof its identity through the unique events of the enunciations, its duplications through the identity of the forms, constitute \nthe function of the field of use in which it is placed. \nThe statement, then, must not be treated as an event that occurred in a particular time and place, and that the most one \ncan do is recall it — and celebrate it from afar off — in an act of memory. But neither is it an ideal form that can be \nactualized in any body, at any time, in any circumstances, and in any material conditions. Too repeatable to be entirely \nidentifiable with the spatio-temporal coordinates of its birth (it is more than the place and date of its appearance), too \nbound up with what surrounds it and supports it to be as free as a pure form (it is more than a law of construction \ngoverning a group of elements), it is endowed with a certain modifiable heaviness, a weight relative to the field in which \nit is placed, a constancy that allows of various uses, a \n((118)) \ntemporal permanence that does not have the inertia of a mere trace or mark, and which does not sleep on its own past. \nWhereas an enunciation may be begun again or re-evoked, and a (linguistic or logical) form may be reactualized, the \nstatement may be repeated — but always in strict conditions. \n \nThis repeatable materiality that characterizes the enunciative function reveals the statement as a specific and paradoxical \nobject, but also as one of those objects that men produce, manipulate, use, transform, exchange, combine, decompose and \nrecompose, and possibly destroy. Instead of being something said once and for all — and lost in the past like the result of \na battle, a geological catastrophe, or the death of a king — the statement, as it emerges in its materiality, appears with a \nstatus, enters various networks and various fields of use, is subjected to transferences or modifications, is integrated into \noperations and strategies in which its identity is maintained or effaced. Thus the statement circulates, is used, disappears, \nallows or prevents the realization of a desire, serves or resists various interests, participates in challenge and struggle, and \nbecomes a theme of appropriation or rivalry. \n \n((119)) \n \n \n3.

It was as if I had regarded the statement as a unit \nthat could be established without difficulty, and that all I had to do was describe its possibilities and laws of combination. \nI now realize that I could not define the statement as a unit of a linguistic type (superior to the phenomenon of the word, \ninferior to the text); but that I was dealing with an enunciative function that involved various units (these may sometimes \nbe sentences, some-times propositions; but they are sometimes made up of fragments of sentences, series or tables of \nsigns, a set of propositions or equivalent formulations); and, instead of giving a 'meaning' to these units, this function \nrelates them to a field of objects; instead of providing them with a subject, it opens up for them a number of possible \nsubjective positions; instead of fixing their limits, it places them in a domain of coordination and coexistence; instead of \ndetermining their identity, it places them in a space in which they are used and repeated.

But I now feel that I must answer two questions: what do I now \nunderstand by the task, which I originally set myself, of describing statements? How can this theory of the statement be \nadjusted to the analysis of discursive formations that I outlined previously? \nI. First task: fix the vocabulary. If we agree to call verbal performance, or, better, linguistic performance, any group of \nsigns produced on the basis of a natural (or artificial) language (langue), we could call formulation the individual (or \npossibly collective) act that reveals, on any material and according to a particular form, that group of signs: the \nformulation is an event that can always be located by its spatio-temporal coordinates, which can always be related to an \nauthor, and which may constitute in itself a specific act (a 'performative' act, as the British analysts call it); we can call \nsentence or proposition the units that grammar or logic may recognize in a group of signs: these units may always be \ncharacterized by the elements that figure in them, and by the rules of construction that unite them; in relation to the \nsentence and the proposition, the questions of origin, time and place, and context are merely subsidiary; the decisive \nquestion is that of their correctness (if only under the form of 'acceptability'). We will call statement the modality of \nexistence proper to that group of signs: a modality that allows it to be something more than a series of traces, something \nmore than a succession of marks on a substance, something more than a mere object made by a human being; a modality \nthat allows it to be in relation with a domain of objects, to prescribe a definite position to any possible subject, to be \nsituated among other verbal performances, and to be endowed with a repeatable materiality. We can now understand the \nreason for the equivocal meaning of the term discourse, which I have used and abused in many different senses: in the \nmost general, and vaguest way, it denoted a group of verbal performances; and by discourse, then, I meant that which was \nproduced (perhaps all that was produced) by the groups of signs. But I also meant a group of acts of formulation, a series \n \n \n((121)) \nof sentences or propositions. Lastly — and it is this meaning that was finally used (together with the first, which served in \na provisional capacity) — discourse is constituted by a group of sequences of signs, in so far as they are statements, that \nis, i.n so far as they can be assigned particular modalities of existence. And if I succeed in showing, as I shall try to do \nshortly, that the law of such a series is precisely what I have so far called a discursive formation, if I succeed in showing \nthat this discursive formation really is the principle of dispersion and redistribution, not of formulations, not of sentences, \nnot of propositions, but of statements (in the sense in which I have used this word), the term discourse can he defined as \nthe group of statements that belong to a single system of formation; thus I shall be able to speak of clinical discourse, \neconomic discourse, the discourse of natural history, psychiatric discourse. \nI am well aware that most of these definitions do not conform with current usage: linguists usually give the word \ndiscourse a quite different meaning; logicians and analysts use the term statement in a different way. But my intention \nhere is not to transfer to some hitherto benighted domain. a set of concepts, a form of analysis, and a theory that have \nbeen formed elsewhere; and I do not intend to use a model by applying it, with its own efficacy, to new contents. Not, of \ncourse, that I wish to question the value of such a model; not that I wish, even before trying it, to limit its application, or \nto lay down the threshold that it must not cross. But I would like to reveal a descriptive possibility, outline the domain of \nwhich. it is capable, define its limits and its autonomy. This descriptive possibility is articulated upon others; i.t does not \nderive from them. \nIn particular, then, the analysis of statements does not claim to he a total, exhaustive description of 'language' \n(langage), or of 'what was said'. In the whole density implied by verbal performances, it is situated at a particular level \nthat must be distinguished from the others, characterized in relation to them, and abstract. In particular, it does not replace \na logical analysis of propositions, a grammatical analysis of sentences, a psychological or contextual analysis of \nformulations: it is another way of attacking verbal performances, of dissociating their complexity, of isolating the terms \nthat are entangled in its web, and of locating the various regularities that they obey. By confronting the \n \n \n((122)) \nstatement with the sentence or the proposition, I am not trying to rediscover a lost totality, or to resuscitate, as many \nwould nostalgically like to do, the plenitude of living speech, the richness of the Word, the profound unity of the Logos. \nThe analysis of statements corresponds to a specific level of description. \n \n2. The statement, then, is not an elementary unity that can be added to the unities described by grammar or logic. It \ncannot be isolated like a sentence, a proposition, or an act of formulation.

The analysis \nof statements, then, is a historical analysis, but one that avoids all interpretation: it does not question things said as to \nwhat they are hiding, what they were 'really' saying, in spite of themselves, the unspoken element that they contain, the \nproliferation of thoughts, images, or fantasies that inhabit them; but, on the contrary, it questions them as to their mode of \nexistence, what it means to them to have come into existence, to have left traces, and perhaps to remain there, awaiting \nthe moment when they might be of use once more; what it means to them to have appeared when and where they did — \nthey and no others. From this point of view, there is no such thing as a latent statement: for what one is concerned with is \nthe fact of language (langage). \nA difficult thesis to sustain. We know — and this has probably been the case ever since men began to speak — that \none thing is often said in place of another; that one sentence may have two meanings at once; that an obvious meaning, \nunderstood without difficulty by everyone, may conceal a second esoteric or prophetic meaning that a more subtle \ndeciphering, or perhaps only the erosion of time, will finally reveal; that beneath a visible formulation, there may reign \nanother that controls it, disturbs it, and imposes on it an articulation of its own; in short, that in one way or another, things \nsaid say more than themselves. But, in fact, these apparent duplications, this unsaid that is nevertheless said, do not affect \nthe statement, at least as it has been defined here. Polysemia — which justifies hermeneutics and the discovery of another \nmeaning — concerns the sentence, and the semantic fields that it employs: the same group of words may give rise to \nseveral meanings, and to several possible constructions; there may be, therefore, inter-woven or alternating, different \nmeanings operating on the same enunciative base. Similarly, the suppression of one verbal performance by another, their \nsubstitution or interference, are phenomena that belong to the level of the formulation (even if they have incidences on \nthe linguistic or logical structures); but the statement itself is not concerned with this duplication or this suppression: \nsince it is the modality of existence of the verbal performance as it has taken place. The \n \n \n((124)) \nstatement cannot be regarded as the cumulative result or the crystallization of several fluctuating, scarcely articulated, and \nmutually opposed statements. The statement is not haunted by the secret presence of the unsaid, of hidden meanings, of \nsuppressions; on the contrary, the way in which these hidden elements function, and in which they can be restored, \ndepends on the enunciative modality itself: we know that the 'unsaid', the 'suppressed', is not the same — either in its \nstructure or in its effect — in the case of a mathematical statement, a statement in economics, an autobiography, or the \naccount of a dream. \nHowever, to all these various modalities of the unsaid that may be located against the background of the enunciative \nfield, should no doubt be added a lack, which, instead of being inside seems to be correlative with this field and to play a \nrole in the determination of its very existence. There may in fact be — and probably always are — in the conditions of \nemergence of statements, exclusions, limits, or gaps that divide up their referential, validate only one series of modalities, \nenclose groups of co-existence, and prevent certain forms of use. But one should not confuse, either in its status or in its \neffect, the lack that is characteristic of an enunciative regularity and the meanings concealed in what is formulated in it. \n \n3. Although the statement cannot be hidden, it is not visible either; it is not presented to the perception as the manifest \nbearer of its limits and characteristics. It requires a certain change of viewpoint and attitude to be recognized and \nexamined in itself. Perhaps it is like the over-familiar that constantly eludes one; those familiar transparencies, which, \n",

Language always seems to be inhabited by the other, \nthe elsewhere, the distant; it is hollowed by absence. Is it not the locus in which something other than itself appears, does \nnot its own existence seem to be dissipated in this function? But if one wishes to describe the enunciative level, one must \nconsider that existence itself; question language, not in the direction to which it refers, but in the dimension that gives it; \nignore its power to designate, to name, to show, to reveal, to be the place of meaning or truth, and, instead, turn one's \nattention to the moment — which is at once solidified, caught up in the play of the 'signifier' and the 'signified' — that \ndetermines its unique and limited existence. In the examination of language, one must suspend, not only the point of \nview of the 'signified' (we are used to this by now), but also that of the 'signifier', and so reveal the fact that, here and \nthere, in relation to possible domains of objects and subjects, in relation to other possible formulations and re-uses, there \nis language. \nThe last reason for this quasi-invisibility of the statement: it is implied, but never made explicit, in all other analyses \nof language. If language is to he taken as an object, decomposed into distinct levels, described and analysed, an \n'enunciative datum' must exist that will always be determined and not infinite: the analysis of a language (longue) always \noperates on a corpus of words and texts; the uncovering and interpretation of implicit meanings always rests on a limited \ngroup of sentences; the logical analysis of a system implies a given group of propositions in the rewriting, in a formal \nlanguage (langage). The enunciative level is neutralized each time: either it is defined only as a representative sample \nthat enables one to free endlessly applicable structures; or it disappears into a pure appearance behind which the truth of \nwords is revealed; or it acts as a neutral substance that serves as a support for formal relations. The fact that, each time, it \nis indispensable if an analysis is to take place deprives it of all relevance for the analysis itself. If one adds to this that all \nthese descriptions can be made only when they themselves form finite groups of statements, it will be clear why they are \nsurrounded on all sides by the enunciative field, why they cannot free themselves from it, and why they cannot take it \n \n \n((126)) \ndirectly as its theme. In considering statements in themselves, we will not seek, beyond all these analyses and at a deeper \nlevel, some secret or some root of language (langage) that they have omitted. We shall try to render visible, and \nanalysable, that immediate transparency that constitutes the element of their possibility. \nNeither hidden, nor visible, the enunciative level is at the limit of language (langage): it is not, in itself, a group of \ncharacteristics that are presented, even in an unsystematic way, to immediate experience; but neither is it the enigmatic, \nsilent remainder that it does not translate. It defines the modality of its appearance: its periphery rather than its internal \norganization, its surface rather than its content. But the fact that one can describe this enunciative surface proves that the \n'given', the datum, of language is not the mere rending of a fundamental silence; that the words, sentences, meanings, \naffirmations, series of propositions do not hack directly on to a primeval night of silence; but that the sudden appearance \nof a sentence, the flash of meaning, the brusque gesture of the index finger of designation, always emerge in the \noperational domain of an enunciative function; that between language as one reads and hears it, and also as one speaks it, \nand the absence of any formulation, there is not a profusion of things half said, sentences left unfinished, thoughts half \nexpressed, an endless monologue of which only a few fragments emerge; but, before all — or in any case before it (for it \ndepends on them) — the conditions according to which the enunciative function operates. This also proves that it is vain \nto seek, beyond structural, formal, or interpretative analyses of language, a domain that is at last freed from all positivity, \nin which the freedom of the subject, the labour of the human being, or the opening up of a transcendental destiny could be \nfulfilled. One should not object to linguistic methods or logical analyses: 'When you have said so much about the rules of \nits construction, what do you do with language itself, in the plenitude of its living body? What do you do with this \nfreedom, or with this meaning that is prior to all signification, without which individuals could not understand one \nanother in the never-ending work of language? Are you not aware that as soon as one has crossed the finite systems that \nmake possible the infinity of discourse, but which are incapable of founding it and of accounting for it, what one finds is \nthe mark of a transcendence, or the work of the human being? \n \n \n",

Such objections must be set aside: for if it is true that there is a \ndimension there that belongs neither to logic nor to linguistics, it is not, for all that, a restored transcendence, nor a way \nthat has been reopened in the direction of an inaccessible origin, nor a creation by the human being of his own meanings. \nLanguage, in its appearance and mode of being, is the statement; as such, it belongs to a description that is neither \ntranscendental nor anthropological. The enunciative analysis does not lay down for linguistic or logical analyses the \nlimit beyond which they must renounce their power and recognize their powerlessness; it does not mark the line that \nencloses their domain; it is deployed in another direction, which intersects them. The possibility of an enunciative \nanalysis, if it is established, must make it possible to raise the transcendental obstacle that a certain form of philosophical \ndiscourse opposes to all analyses of language, in the name of the being of that language and of the ground from which it \nshould derive its origin. \nI must now turn to the second group of questions: how can the description of statements, thus defined, be adjusted to the \nanalysis of discursive formations, the principles of which I outlined above? And inversely: to what extent can one say \nthat the analysis of discursive formations really is a description of statements, in the sense in which I have used this \nword? It is important to answer these questions; for it is at this point that the enterprise to which I have devoted myself \nfor so many years, which I have developed in a somewhat blind way, but of which I am now trying — even if I readjust \nit, even if I rectify a number of errors or imprudences — to recapture the general outline, must close its circle. As has \nalready become clear, I am not trying to say here what I once tried to say in this or that concrete analysis, or to describe \nthe project that I had in mind, the obstacles that I encountered, the attempts that I was forced to abandon, the more or \nless satisfactory results that I managed to obtain; I am not describing an effective trajectory in order to indicate what \nshould have been and what will be from \n \n \n((128)) \nnow on: I am trying to elucidate in itself – in order to measure it and to determine its requirements – a possibility of \ndescription that I have used without being aware of its constraints and resources; rather than trying to discover what I \nsaid, and what I might have said, I shall try to reveal, in its own regularity – a regularity that I have not yet succeeded in \nmastering – what made it possible to say what I did. But one can also see that I am not developing here a theory, in the \nstrict sense of the term: the deduction, on the basis of a number of axioms, of an abstract model applicable to an indefinite \nnumber of empirical descriptions. If such an edifice were ever possible, the time for it has certainly not yet arrived. I am \nnot inferring the analysis of discursive formations from a definition of statements that would serve as a basis; nor am I \ninferring the nature of statements from what discursive formations are, as one was able to abstract them from this or that \ndescription; but I am trying to show how a domain can be organized, without flaw, without contradiction, without internal \narbitrariness, in which statements, their principle of grouping, the great historical unities that they may form, and the \nmethods that make it possible to describe them are all brought into question. I am not proceeding by linear deduction, but \nrather by concentric circles, moving sometimes towards the outer and some-times towards the inner ones: beginning with \nthe problem of dis-continuity in discourse and of the uniqueness of the statement (the central theme), I have tried to \nanalyse, on the periphery, certain forms of enigmatic groupings; but the principles of unification with which I was then \npresented, and which are neither grammatical, nor logical, nor psychological, and which consequently cannot refer either \nto sentences, propositions, or representations, forced me to return to the centre, to that problem of the statement; to try to \nelucidate what is meant by the term statement. And I will consider, not that I have constructed a rigorous theoretical \nmodel, but that I have freed a coherent domain of description, that I have, if not established the model, at least opened up \nand arranged the possibility of one, if I have been able to 'loop the loop', and show that the analysis of discursive \nformations really is centred on a description of the statement in its specificity. In short, if I have been able to show that \nthey really are the proper dimensions of the statement that are at work in the mapping of discursive formations. Rather \nthan founding a theory – and perhaps before being \n \n \n((129)) \nable to do so (I do not deny that I regret not yet having succeeded in doing so) — my present concern is to establish a \npossibility. \nIn examining the statement what we have discovered is a function that has a bearing on groups of signs, which is \nidentified neither with grammatical 'acceptability' nor with logical correctness, and which requires if it is to operate: a \nreferential (which. is not exactly a fact, a state of things, or even an object, but a principle of differentiation); a subject \n(not the speaking consciousness, not the author of the formula-tion, but a position that may be filled in certain conditions \nby various individuals) ; an associated field (which is not the real context of the formulation, the situation in which it was \narticulated, but a domain of coexistence for other statements); a materiality (which is not only the substance or support of \n",

Now, what has been described as \ndiscursive formations are, strictly speaking, groups of statements. That is, groups of verbal performances that are not \nlinked to one another at the sentence level by grammatical (syntactical or semantic) links; which are not linked to one \nanother at the proposition level by logical links (links of formal coherence or conceptual connexion); and which are not \nlinked either at the formulation level by psychological links (either the identity of the forms of consciousness, the \nconstancy of the mentalities, or the repetition of a project); but which are linked at the statement level. That which implies \nthat one can define the general set of rules that govern their objects, the form of dispersion that regularly divides up what \nthey say, the system of their referentials; that which implies that one defines the general set of rules that govern the \ndifferent modes of enunciation, the possible distribution of the subjective positions, and the system that defines and \nprescribes them; that which implies that one defines the set of rules common to all their associated domains, the forms of \nsuccession, of simultaneity, of the repetition of which they are capable, and the system that links all these fields of co-\nexistence together; lastly, that which implies that one can define the general set of rules that govern the status of these \nstatements, the way in which they are institutionalized, received, used, re-used., combined together, the mode according \nto which they become objects of appropriation, instruments for desire or interest, elements for a strategy. To describe \nstatements, to describe the enunciative function of \n \n \n((130)) \nwhich they are the bearers, to analyse the conditions in which this function operates, to cover the different domains that \nthis function presupposes and the way in which those domains are articulated, is to undertake to uncover what might be \ncalled the discursive formation. Or again, which amounts to the same thing, but in the opposite direction; the discursive \nformation is the general enunciative system that governs a group of verbal performances — a system that is not alone in \ngoverning it, since it also obeys, and in accordance with its other dimensions, logical, linguistic, and psychological \nsystems. What has been called 'discursive formation' divides up the general plane of things said at the specific level of \nstatements. The four directions in which it is analysed (formation of objects, formation of the subjective positions, \nformation of concepts, formation of strategic choices) correspond to the four domains in which the enunciative function \noperates. And if the discursive formations are free in relation to the great rhetorical unities of the text or the book, if they \nare not governed by the rigour of a deductive architecture, if they are not identified with the oeuvre of an author, it is \nbecause they bring into play the enunciative level, together with the regularities that characterize it, and not the \ngrammatical level of sentences, or the logical level of propositions, or the psychological level of formulation. \nOn this basis, we can now advance a number of propositions that lie at the heart of these analyses: \n \n1 . It can be said that the mapping of discursive formations, independently of other principles of possible unification, \nreveals the specific level of the statement; but it can also be said that the description of statements and of the way in \nwhich the enunciative level is organized leads to the individualization of the discursive formations. The two approaches \nare equally justifiable and reversible. The analysis of the statement and that of the formation are established \ncorrelatively. When the time finally comes to found a theory, it will have to define a deductive order. \n \n2. A statement belongs to a discursive formation as a sentence belongs to a text, and a proposition to a deductive \nwhole. But whereas the regularity of a sentence is defined by the laws of a language (longue), \n \n \n((131)) \nand that of a proposition by the laws of logic, the regularity of statements is defined by the discursive formation itself. \nThe fact of its belonging to a discursive formation and the laws that govern it are one and the same thing; this is not \nparadoxical since the discursive forma-tion is characterized not by principles of construction but by a dispersion of fact, \nsince for statements it is not a condition of possibility but a law of coexistence, and since statements are not \ninterchangeable elements but groups characterized by their modality of existence. \n \n3.So we can now give a full meaning to the definition of 'dis-course' that we suggested above. We shall call \ndiscourse a group of statements in so far as they belong to the same discursive formation; it does not form a rhetorical \nor formal unity, endlessly repeatable, whose appearance or use in history might be indicated (and, if necessary, \nexplained) ; it is made up of a limited number of statements for which a group of conditions of existence can be \ndefined. Discourse in this sense is not an ideal, timeless form that also possesses a history; the problem is not \ntherefore to ask one-self how and why it was able to emerge and become embodied at this point in time; it is, from \nbeginning to end, historical — a fragment of history, a unity and discontinuity in history itself, posing the problem of \nits own limits, its divisions, its transformations, the specific modes of its temporality rather than its sudden irruption \nin the midst of the complicities of time. \n",

RARITY, EXTERIORITY, ACCUMULATION \nThe enunci.ative analysis takes into consideration an element of rarity. \nGenerally speaking, the analysis of discourse operates between the twin poles of totality and plethora. One shows how \nthe different texts with which one is dealing refer to one another, organize themselves into a single figure, converge with \ninstitutions and practices, and carry meanings that may be common to a whole period. Each element con-sidered is taken \nas the expression of the totality to which it belongs and whose limits it exceeds. And in this way one substitutes for the \ndiversity of the things said a sort of great, uniform text, which has never before been articulated, and which reveals for the \nfirst time what men 'really meant' not only in their words and texts, their discourses and their writings, but also in the \ninstitutions, practices, techniques, and objects that they produced. In relation to this implicit, sovereign, communal \n'meaning', statements appear in superabundant proliferation, since it is to that meaning alone that they all refer and to it \nalone that they owe their truth: a plethora of signifying elements in relation to this single 'signified' (signifie). But this \nprimary and ultimate mean-ing springs up through the manifest formulations, it hides beneath what appears, and secretly \nduplicates it, because each discourse \n \n \n((134)) \ncontains the power to say something other than what it actually says, and thus to embrace a plurality of meanings: a \nplethora of the 'signified' in relation to a single 'signifier'. From this point of view, discourse is both plenitude and endless \nwealth. \nThe analysis of statements and discursive formations opens up a quite contrary direction: it wishes to determine the \nprinciple according to which only the 'signifying' groups that were enunciated could appear. It sets out to establish a law \nof rarity. This task involves several aspects: \n \n—It is based on the principle that everything is never said; in relation to what might have been stated in a natural \nlanguage (longue), in relation to the unlimited combination of linguistic elements, statements (however numerous they \nmay be) are always in deficit; on the basis of the grammar and of the wealth of vocabulary available at a given period, \nthere are, in total, relatively few things that are said.

We are analysing statements, not as being in the place of other \nstatements that have fallen below the line of possible emergence, but as being always in their own place. They are put \nback into a space that is entirely deployed and involves no reduplication. There is no sub-text. And therefore no plethora. \nThe enunciative domain is identical with its own surface. Each statement occupies in it a place that belongs to it alone. \nThe description of a statement does not consist therefore in rediscovering the unsaid whose place it occupies; nor how \none can reduce it to a silent, common text; but on the contrary in discovering what special place it occupies, what \nramifications of the system of formations make it possible to map its localization, how it is isolated in the general \ndispersion of statements. \n \n—This rarity of statements, the incomplete, fragmented form of the enunciative field, the fact that few things, in all, \ncan be said, explain that statements are not, like the air we breathe, an infinite transparency; but things that are \ntransmitted and preserved, that have value, and which one tries to appropriate; that are repeated, reproduced, and \ntransformed; to which pre-established networks are adapted, and to which a status is given in the institution; things that \nare duplicated not only by copy or translation, but by exegesis, commentary, and the internal proliferation of meaning. \nBecause statements are rare, they are collected in unifying totalities, and the meanings to be found in them are multiplied. \n \nUnlike all those interpretations whose very existence is possible only through the actual rarity of statements, but which \nnevertheless ignore that rarity, and, on the contrary, take as their theme the compact richness of what is said, the analysis \nof discursive formations turns back towards that rarity itself; it takes that rarity as its explicit object; it tries to determine \nits unique system; and, at the same time, it takes account of the fact that there could have been interpretation. To interpret \nis a way of reacting to enunciative poverty, and to compensate for it by a multiplication of meaning; a way of speaking on \nthe basis of that poverty, and yet despite it. But to analyse a discursive formation is to \n \n \n((136)) \nseek the law of that poverty, it is to weigh it up, and to determine its specific form. In one sense, therefore, it is to weigh \nthe 'value' of statements. A value that is not defined by their truth, that is not gauged by the presence of a secret content; \nbut which characterizes their place, their capacity for circulation and exchange, their possibility of trans-formation, not \nonly in the economy of discourse, but, more generally, in the administration of scarce resources. In this sense, discourse \nceases to be what it is for the exegetic attitude: an inexhaustible treasure from which one can always draw new, and \nalways unpredictable riches; a providence that has always spoken in advance, and which enables one to hear, when one \nknows how to listen, retrospective oracles: it appears as an asset — finite, limited, desirable, useful — that has its own \nrules of appearance, but also its own conditions of appropriation and operation; an asset that consequently, from the \nmoment of its existence (and not only in its 'practical applications'), poses the question of power; an asset that is, by \nnature, the object of a struggle, a political struggle. \nAnother characteristic feature: the analysis of statements treats them in the systematic form of exteriority. Usually, \nthe historical description of things said is shot through with the opposition of interior and exterior; and wholly directed \nby a desire to move from the exterior — which may be no more than contingency or mere material necessity, a visible \nbody or uncertain translation — towards the essential nucleus of interiority. To undertake the history of what has been \nsaid is to re-do, in the opposite direction, the work of expression: to go back from statements preserved through time and \ndispersed in space, towards that interior secret that preceded them, left its mark in them, and (in every sense of the term) \nis betrayed by them. Thus the nucleus of the initiating subjectivity is freed. A subjectivity that always lags behind \nmanifest history; and which finds, beneath events, another, more serious, more secret, more fundamental history, closer \nto the origin, more firmly linked to its ultimate horizon (and consequently more in control of all its determinations). This \nother history, which runs beneath history, constantly anticipating it and endlessly recollecting the past, can be described \n— in a sociological or psychological way — as the evolution of mentalities; it can be given a philosophical status in the \nrecollection of the Logos or the teleology of reason; lastly, it can be purified in \n \n",

    "chunk_full": "the problematic of a trace, which, prior to all speech, is the opening of inscription, the gap of deferred time, it is always \nthe historicotranscendental theme that is reinvested. \nA theme whose enunciative analysis tries to free itself. In order to restore statements to their pure dispersion. In order \nto analyse them in an exteriority that may be paradoxical since it refers to no adverse form of interiority. In order to \nconsider them in their discontinuity, without having to relate them, by one of those shifts that disconnect them and render \nthem inessential, to a more fundamental opening or difference. In order to seize their very irruption, at the place and at the \nmoment at which it occurred. In order to rediscover their occurrence as an event. Perhaps we should speak of 'neutrality' \nrather than exteriority; but even this word implies rather too easily a suspension of belief, an effacement or a 'placing in \nparentheses' of all position of existence, whereas it is a question of rediscovering that outside in which, in their relative \nrarity, in their incomplete proximity, in their deployed space, enunciative events are distributed. \n \n—This task presupposes that the field of statements is not described as a 'translation' of operations or processes that \ntake place elsewhere (in men's thought, in their consciousness or unconscious, in the sphere of transcendental \nconstitutions); but that it is accepted, in its empirical modesty, as the locus of particular events, regularities, relationships, \nmodifications and systematic transformations; in short, that it is treated not as the result or trace of something else, but as \na practical domain that is autonomous (although dependent) , and which can be described at its own level (although it \nmust be articulated on something other than itself). \n \n—It also presupposes that this enunciative domain refers neither to an individual subject, nor to some kind of \ncollective consciousness, nor to a transcendental subjectivity; but that it is described as an anonymous field whose \nconfiguration defines the possible position of speaking subjects. Statements should no longer be situated in relation to a \nsover-eign subjectivity, but recognize in the different forms of the speaking subjectivity effects proper to the enunciative \nfield. \n \n((138)) \nAs a result, it presupposes that, in its transformations, in its successive series, in its derivations, the field of \nstatements does not obey the temporality of the consciousness as its necessary model. One must not hope — at least at \nthis level and in this form of description — to be able to write a history of things said that is legitimately, in its form, in \nits regularity and in its nature, the history of an individual or anonymous consciousness, of a project, of a system of \nintentions, of a set of aims. The time of discourse is not the translation, in a visible chronology, of the obscure time of \nthought. \n \nThe analysis of statements operates therefore without reference to a cogito. It does not pose the question of the \nspeaking subject, who reveals or who conceals himself in what he says, who, in speaking, exercises his sovereign \nfreedom, or who, without realizing it, subjects himself to constraints of which he is only dimly aware. In fact, it is situated \nat the level of the 'it is said' — and we must not understand by this a sort of communal opinion, a collective representation \nthat is imposed on every individual; we must not understand by it a great, anonymous voice that must, of necessity, speak \nthrough the discourses of everyone; but we must understand by it the totality of things said, the relations, the regularities, \nand the transformations that may be observed in them, the domain of which certain figures, certain inter-sections indicate \nthe unique place of a speaking subject and may be given the name of author. `Anyone who speaks', but what he says is \nnot said from anywhere. It is necessarily caught up in the play of an exteriority. \nThe third feature of enunciative analysis: it is addressed to specific forms of accumulation that can be identified \nneither with an interiorization in the form of memory nor with an undiscriminating totalization of documents. Usually, \nwhen one analyses already existing discourses, one regards them as having sprung from an essential inertia: they have \nsurvived vived through chance, or through the care with which men have treated them, and the illusions that they have \nentertained as to their value and the immortal dignity of their words; but now they are nothing more than written symbols \npiling up in dusty libraries, slumbering in a sleep towards which they have never ceased to glide since the day they were \npronounced, since they were forgotten \n((139)) \nand their visible effect lost in time. At most they may be lucky enough to be picked up and examined in some chance \n",

These four terms: reading — trace — decipherment — memory (however much importance \none may accord to one or another of them, and whatever the metaphorical extent that one may accord it, and which \nenables it to embrace the other three) define the system that usually makes it possible to snatch past discourse from its \ninertia and, for a moment, to rediscover something of its lost vitality. \nNow, the function of enunciative analysis is not to awaken texts from their present sleep, and, by reciting the marks \nstill legible on their surface, to rediscover the flash of their birth; on the contrary, its function is to follow them through \ntheir sleep, or rather to take up the related themes of sleep, oblivion, and lost origin, and to discover what mode of \nexistence may characterize statements, independently of their enunciation, in the density of time in which they are \npreserved, in which they are reactivated, and used, in which they are also — but this was not their original destiny — \nforgotten, and possibly even destroyed. \n \n—This analysis presupposes that statements are considered in the remanence (remanence) that is proper to them, and \nwhich is not that of an ever-realizable reference back to the past event of the formulation. To say that statements are \nresidual (remanent) is not to say that they remain in the field of memory, or that it is possible to rediscover what they \nmeant; but it means that they are preserved by virtue of a number of supports and material techniques (of which the book \nis, of course, only one example), in accordance with certain types of institutions (of which the library is one), and with \ncertain statutory modalities (which are not the same in the case of a religious text, a law, or a scientific truth). This also \nmeans that they are invested in techniques that put them into operation, in practices that derive from them, in the social \nrelations that they form, or, through those relations, modify. Lastly, it means that things do not have quite the same mode \nof existence, the \n \n \n((140)) \nsame system of relations with their environment, the same schemata of use, the same possibilities of transformation \nonce they have been said. This survival in time is far from being the accidental or fortunate prolongation of an \nexistence originally intended only for the moment; on the contrary, this remanence is of the nature of the statement; \noblivion and destruction are in a sense only the zero degree of this remanence. And against the background that it \nconstitutes, the operations of memory can be deployed. \n \n—This analysis also presupposes that statements are treated in the form of additivity that is specific to them. In \nfact, the types of grouping between successive statements are not always the same, and they never proceed by a \nsimple piling-up or juxtaposition of successive elements. Mathematical statements are not added to one another in \nthe same way as religious texts or laws (they each have their own way of merging together, annulling one another, \nexcluding one another, complement-ing one another, forming groups that are in varying degrees indissociable and \nendowed with unique properties). Moreover, these forms of additivity are not given once and for all, and for a \nparticular category of statements: medical case-history today forms a corpus of knowledge that does not obey the \nsame laws of composition as medical case-history in the eighteenth century; modern mathematics does not \naccumulate its statements according to the same model as Euclidean geometry. \n \n—Lastly, enunciative analysis presupposes that one takes phenomena of recurrence into account. Every statement \ninvolves a field of antecedent elements in relation to which it is situated, but which it is able to reorganize and \nredistribute according to new relations. It constitutes its own past, defines, in what precedes it, its own filiation, \nredefines what makes it possible or necessary, excludes what cannot be compatible with it. And it poses this \nenunciative past as an acquired truth, as an event that has occurred, as a form that can be modified, as material to be \ntransformed, or as an object that can be spoken about, etc. In relation to all these possibilities of recurrence, \nmemory and oblivion, the rediscovery of meaning or its repression, far from being fundamental, are merely unique \nfigures. \n((141)) \nThe description of statements and discursive formations must there-fore free itself from the widespread and persistent \nimage of return. It does not claim to go back, beyond a time that is no more than a falling off, a latency, an oblivion, a \ncovering up or a wandering, towards that moment of foundation when speech was not yet caught up in any form of \nmateriality, when it had no chances of survival, and when it was confined to the non-determined dimension of the \nopening. It does not try to constitute for the already said the paradoxical instant of the second birth; it does not invoke a \n",

It is to \nestablish what I am quite willing to call a positivity. To analyse a discursive formation therefore is to deal with a group of \nverbal performances at the level of the statements and of the form of positivity that characterizes them; or, more briefly, it \nis to define the type of positivity of a discourse.

But what it does reveal is \nthe extent to which Buffon and Linnaeus (or Turgot and Quesnay, Broussais and Bichat) were talking about 'the same \nthing', by placing themselves at 'the same level' or at 'the same distance', by deploying 'the same conceptual field', by \nopposing one another on 'the same field of battle'; and it reveals, on the other hand, why one cannot say that Darwin is \ntalking about the same thing as Diderot, that Laennec continues the work of Van Swieten, or that Jevons answers the \nPhysiocrats.

Different \noeuvres, dispersed books, that whole mass of texts that belong to a single discursive formation — and so many authors \nwho know or do not know one another, criticize one another, invalidate one another, pillage one another, meet without \nknowing it and obstinately intersect their unique discourses in a web of which they are not the masters, of which they \ncannot see the whole, and of whose breadth they have a very inadequate idea — all these various figures and individuals \ndo not communicate solely by the logical succession of propositions that they advance, nor by the recurrence of themes, \nnor by the obstinacy of a meaning transmitted, forgot-ten, and rediscovered; they communicate by the form of positivity \nof their discourse, or more exactly, this form of positivity (and the conditions of operation of the enunciative function) \ndefines a field in which formal identities, thematic continuities, translations of concepts, and polemical interchanges may \nbe deployed. Thus positivity plays the role of what might be called a historical a priori. \nJuxtaposed, these two words produce a rather startling effect; what I mean by the term is an a priori that is not a \ncondition of validity for judgements, but a condition of reality for statements. It is not a question of rediscovering what \nmight legitimize an assertion, but of freeing the conditions of emergence of statements, the law of their coexistence with \nothers, the specific form of their mode of being, the principles according to which they survive, become transformed, and \ndisappear. An a priori not of truths that might never be said, or really given to experience; but the a priori of a history that \nis given, since it is that of things actually said. The reason for using this rather barbarous term is that this a priori must \ntake account of statements in their dispersion, in all the flaws opened up by their non-coherence, in their overlapping and \nmutual replacement, in their simultaneity, which is not unifiable, and in their succession, which is not deductible; in short, \nit has to take account of the fact that discourse has not only a meaning or a truth, but a history, and a specific history that \ndoes not refer it back to the laws of an alien development. It must show, for example, that the history of grammar is not \nthe projection into the field of language and its problems of a history that is generally that of reason or of a particular \nmentality, a history in any case that it shares with medicine, \n \n \n((144)) \nmechanical sciences, or theology; but that it involves a type of history — a form of dispersion in time, a mode of \nsuccession, of stability, and of reactivation, a speed of deployment or rotation — that belongs to it alone, even if it is not \nentirely unrelated to other types of history. Moreover, this a priori does not elude historicity: it does not constitute, above \nevents, and in an unmoving heaven, an atemporal structure; it is defined as the group of rules that characterize a \ndiscursive practice: but these rules are not imposed from the outside on the elements that they relate together; they are \ncaught up in the very things that they connect; and if they are not modified with the least of them, they modify them, and \nare transformed with them into certain decisive thresholds. The a priori of positivities is not only the system of a temporal \ndispersion; it is itself a transformable group. \nOpposed to formal a prioris whose jurisdiction extends without contingence, there is a purely empirical figure; but on \nthe other hand, since it makes it possible to grasp discourses in the law of their actual development, it must be able to take \naccount of the fact that such a discourse, at a given moment, may accept or put into operation, or, on the contrary, \nexclude, forget, or ignore this or that formal structure. It cannot take account (by some kind of psychological or cultural \ngenesis) of the formal a prioris; but it enables us to understand how the formal a prioris may have in history points of \ncontact, places of insertion, irruption, or emergence, domains or occasions of operation, and to understand how this \nhistory may be not an absolutely extrinsic contingence, not a necessity of form deploying its own dialectic, but a specific \nregularity. Nothing, therefore, would be more pleasant, or more inexact, than to conceive of this historical a priori as a \nformal a priori that is also endowed with a history: a great, unmoving, empty figure that irrupted one day on the surface of \ntime, that exercised over men's thought a tyranny that none could escape, and which then suddenly disappeared in a \ntotally unexpected, totally unprecedented eclipse: a transcendental syncopation, a play of intermittent forms. The formal a \npriori and the historical a priori neither belong to the same level nor share the same nature: if they intersect, it is because \nthey occupy two different dimensions. \nThe domain of statements thus articulated in accordance with historical a prioris, thus characterized by different types \nof positivity, and \n \n \n((145)) \ndivided up by distinct discursive formations, no longer has that appearance of a monotonous, endless plain that I \n",

We are now dealing with a complex volume, in which heterogeneous regions are \ndifferentiated or deployed, in accordance with specific rules and practices that cannot be superposed. Instead of seeing, \non the great mythical book of history, lines of words that translate in visible characters thoughts that were formed in \nsome other time and place, we have in the density of dis-cursive practices, systems that establish statements as events \n(with their own conditions and domain of appearance) and things (with their own possibility and field of use). They are \nall these systems of statements (whether events or things) that I propose to call archive. \nBy this term I do not mean the sum of all the texts that a culture has kept upon its person as documents attesting to its \nown past, or as evidence of a continuing identity; nor do I mean the institutions, which, in a given society, make it \npossible to record and preserve those discourses that one wishes to remember and keep in circulation. On the contrary, it \nis rather the reason why so many things, said by so many men, for so long, have not emerged in accordance with the \nsame laws of thought, or the same set of circumstances, why they are not simply the signalization, at the level of verbal \nperformances, of what could be deployed in the order of the mind or in the order of things; but they appeared by virtue \nof a whole set of relations that are peculiar to the discursive level; why, instead of being adventitious figures, grafted, as \nit were, in a rather haphazard way, on to silent processes, they are born in accordance with specific regularities; in short, \nwhy, if there are things said — and those only — one should seek the immediate reason for them in the things that were \nsaid not in them, nor in the men that said them, but in the system of discursivity, in the emmciative possibilities and \nimpossibilites that it lays down. The archive is first the law of what can be said, the system that governs the appearance \nof statements as unique events. But the archive is also that which deter-mines that all these things said do not accumulate \nendlessly in an amorphous mass, nor are they inscribed in an unbroken linearity, nor \n \n \n((146)) \ndo they disappear at the mercy of chance external accidents; but they are grouped together in distinct figures, composed \ntogether in accordance with multiple relations, maintained or blurred in accordance with specific regularities; that which \ndetermines that they do not withdraw at the same pace in time, but shine, as it were, like stars, some that seem close to us \nshining brightly from afar off, while others that are in fact close to us are already growing pale. The archive is not that \nwhich, despite its immediate escape, safeguards the event of the statement, and preserves, for future memories, its status \nas an escapee; it is that which, at the very root of the statement-event, and in that which embodies it, defines at the outset \nthe system of its enunciability. Nor is the archive that which collects the dust of statements that have become inert once \nmore, and which may make possible the miracle of their resurrection; it is that which defines the mode of occurrence of \nthe statement-thing; it is the system of its functioning. Far from being that which unifies every-thing that has been said in \nthe great confused murmur of a discourse, far from being only that which ensures that we exist in the midst of preserved \ndiscourse, it is that which differentiates discourses in their multiple existence and specifies them in their own duration. \nBetween the language (langue) that defines the system of constructing possible sentences, and the corpus that \npassively collects the words that are spoken, the archive defines a particular level: that of a practice that causes a \nmultiplicity of statements to emerge as so many regular events, as so many things to be dealt with and manipulated. It \ndoes not have the weight of tradition; and it does not constitute the library of all libraries, outside time and place; nor is it \nthe welcoming oblivion that opens up to all new speech the operational field of its freedom; between tradition and \noblivion, it reveals the rules of a practice that enables statements both to survive and to undergo regular modification. It is \nthe general system of the formation and transformation of statements. \nIt is obvious that the archive of a society, a culture, or a civilization cannot be described exhaustively; or even, no \ndoubt, the archive of a whole period. On the other hand, it is not possible for us to describe our own archive, since it is \nfrom within these rules that we speak, since it is that which gives to what we can say — and to itself, the object of our \ndiscourse — its modes of appearance, its forms of existence and \n \n",

It emerges in fragments, regions, and levels, more fully, no doubt, and with greater \nsharpness, the greater the time that separates us from it: at most, were it not for the rarity of the documents, the greater \nchronological distance would be necessary to analyse it. And yet could this description of the archive be justified, could it \nelucidate that which makes it possible, map out the place where it speaks, control its rights and duties, test and develop its \nconcepts — at least at this stage of the search, when it can define its possibilities only in the moment of their realization \n— if it persisted in describing only the most distant horizons? Should it not approach as close as possible to the positivity \nthat governs it and the archive system that makes it possible today to speak of the archive in general? Should it not \nilluminate, if only in an oblique way, that enunciative field of which it is itself a part? The analysis of the archive, then, \ninvolves a privileged region: at once close to us, and different from our present existence, it is the border of time that \nsurrounds our presence, which overhangs it, and which indicates it in its otherness; it is that which, outside ourselves, \ndelimits us. The description of the archive deploys its possibilities (and the mastery of its possibilities) on the basis of the \nvery discourses that have just ceased to be ours; its threshold of existence is established by the discontinuity that separates \nus from what we can no longer say, and from that which falls outside our discursive practice; it begins with the outside of \nour own language (langage); its locus is the gap between our own discursive practices. In this sense, it is valid for our \ndiagnosis. Not because it would enable us to draw up a table of our distinctive features, and to sketch out in advance the \nface that we will have in the future. But it deprives us of our continuities; it dissipates that temporal identity in which we \nare pleased to look at ourselves when we wish to exorcise the discontinuities of history; it breaks the thread of \ntranscendental teleologies; and where anthropological thought once questioned man's being or subjectivity, it now bursts \nopen the other, and the outside. In this sense, the diagnosis does not establish the fact of our identity by the play of \ndistinctions. It establishes that we are difference, that our reason is the difference of discourses, our history the difference \nof times, our selves the difference of masks. That difference, far from \n \n \n((148)) \nbeing the forgotten and recovered origin, i.s this dispersion that we are and. make. \nThe never completed, never wholly achieved uncovering of the archive forms the general \nhorizon to which the description of discursive formations, the analysis of positivities, the \nmapping of the enunciative field belong. The right of words — which i.s not that of the \nphilologists — authorizes, therefore, the use of the term archaeology to describe all these \nsearches. This term does not imply the search for a beginning; it does not relate analysis to \ngeological excavation. It designates the general theme of a description that questions the already-\nsaid at the level of its existence: of the enunciative function that operates within it, of the \ndiscursive formation, and the general archive system to which it belongs.

Indeed, \nwe must: for, to be frank, as they are at the moment, things are rather disturbing. I set out with a relatively simple \nproblem: the division of discourse into great unities that were not those of oeuvres, authors, books, or themes. And with \nthe sole purpose of establishing them, I have set about constructing a whole series of notions (discursive formations, \npositivity, archive), I have defined a domain (statements, the enunciative field, discursive practices), I have tried to \nreveal the specificity of a method that is neither formalizing nor interpretative; in short, I have appealed to a whole \napparatus, whose sheer weight and, no doubt, somewhat bizarre machinery are a source of embarrassment. For two or \nthree reasons: there exist already enough methods for describing and analysing language (langage) for it not to be \npresumptuous to wish to add another. And, anyway, I was suspicious of such unities of discourse as the 'book' and the \n'oeuvre' because I suspected \n \n \n((152)) \nthem of not being as immediate and self-evident as they appeared: is it reasonable to replace them by unities that one has \nestablished with so much effort, after so much groping, and in accordance with principles so obscure that it has taken \nhundreds of pages to elucidate them? And are the things that all these instruments finally delimit, those 'dis-courses' \nwhose identity they map out, the same as those figures (called 'psychiatry', or 'political economy', or 'Natural History') \nfor which I empirically set out, and which have provided me with a pretext for developing this strange arsenal? It is n.ow \nof the utmost importance that I should measure the descriptive efficacy of the notions that I have tried to define. I must \ndiscover whether the machine works, and what it can produce. What, then, can this 'archaeology' offer that other descrip-\ntions are unable to provide? What are the rewards for such a heavy enterprise? \nAnd now a suspicion occurs to me. I have behaved as if I were discovering a n.ew domain, as if, in order to chart it, I \nneeded new measurements and guide-lines. But, in fact, was I not all the time in that very space that has long been \nknown as 'the history of ideas'? Was it not to that space that I was implicitly referring, even when on two or three \noccasions I tried to keep my distance? And if I had not forced myself to turn away from it, would I not have found in it, \nalready prepared, already analysed, all that I was looking for? Perhaps I am a historian of ideas after all. But an ashamed, \nor, if you prefer, a pre-sumptuous historian of ideas. One who set out to renew his discipline from top to bottom; who \nwanted., no doubt, to achieve a rigour that so many other, similar descriptions have recently acquired; but who, unable to \nmodify in any real way that old form of analysis, to make it cross the threshold of scientificity (or finding that such a \nmeta-morphosis is always impossible, or that h.e did not have the strength to effect that transformation himself), declares \nthat h.e had been doing, and wanted to do, something quite different. All this new fog just to hide what remained in the \nsame landscape, fixed to an old patch of ground cultivated to the point of exhaustion. I cannot be satisfied until I have \ncut myself off from 'the history of ideas', until I have shown in what way archaeological analysis differs from the \ndescriptions of 'the history of ideas'. \nIt is not easy to characterize a discipline like the history of ideas: it is \n \n \n",

The history not of literature but of that tangential rumour, that everyday, transient writing that never \nacquires the status of an oeuvre, or is immediately lost: the analysis of sub-literatures, almanacs, reviews and newpapers, \ntemporary successes, anonymous authors. Thus defined — but one can see at once how difficult it is to fix precise limits \nfor it — the history of ideas is concerned with all that insidious thought, that whole interplay of representations that flow \nanonymously between men; in the interstices of the great discursive monuments, it reveals the crumbling soil on which \nthey are based. It is the discipline of fluctuating languages (langages), of shapeless works, of unrelated themes. The \nanalysis of opinions rather than of knowledge, of errors rather than of truth, of types of mentality rather than of forms of \nthought. \nBut on the other hand the history of ideas sets out to cross the boundaries of existing disciplines, to deal with them \nfrom the outside, and to reinterpret them. Rather than a marginal domain, then, it constitutes a style of analysis, a putting \ninto perspective. It takes account of the historical field of the sciences, of literature, of philosophy: but it describes the \nknowledge that has served as an empirical., unreflective basis for subsequent formalizations; it tries to rediscover the \nimmediate experience that discourse transcribes; it follows the genesis, which, on the basis of received or acquired \nrepresentations, gives birth to systems and ceuvres. It shows, on the other hand, how the great figures that are built up in \nthis way gradually decompose: how the themes fall apart, pursue their isolated lives, fall into disuse, or are recomposed in \na new \n \n \n((154)) \nway. The history of ideas, then, is the discipline of beginnings and ends, the description of obscure continuities and \nreturns, the reconstitution of developments in the linear form of history. But it can also, by that very fact, describe, from \none domain to another, the whole inter-play of exchanges and intermediaries: it shows how scientific know-ledge is \ndiffused, gives rise to philosophical concepts, and takes form perhaps in literary works; it shows how problems, notions, \nthemes may emigrate from the philosophical field where they were formulated to scientific or political discourses; it \nrelates work with institutions, social customs or behaviour, techniques, and unrecorded needs and practices; it tries to \nrevive the most elaborate forms of discourse in the concrete landscape, in the midst of the growth and development that \nwitnessed their birth. It becomes therefore the discipline of interferences, the description of the concentric circles that \nsurround works, underline them, relate them to one another, and insert them into whatever they are not. \nIt is clear how these two roles of the history of ideas are articulated one upon the other. In its most general form, it can \nbe said that it continually describes — and in all the directions in which it operates — the transition from non-philosophy \nto philosophy, from non-scientificity to science, from non-literature to the æuvre itself. It is the analysis of silent births, or \ndistant correspondences, of permanences that persist beneath apparent changes, of slow formations that profit from \ninnumerable blind complicities, of those total figures that gradually come together and suddenly condense into the fine \npoint of the work. Genesis, continuity, totalization: these are the great themes of the history of ideas, and that by which it \nis attached to a certain, now traditional, form of historical analysis. In these conditions, it is normal that anyone who still \npractises history, its methods, its requirements and possibilities — this now rather shop-soiled idea — cannot conceive \nthat a discipline like the history of ideas should be abandoned; or rather, considers that any other form of analysing \ndiscourses is a betrayal of history itself. But archaeological description is precisely such an abandonment of the history of \nideas, a systematic rejection of its postulates and procedures, an attempt to practise a quite different history of what men \nhave said. That some people do not recognize in this enterprise the history of their \n \n \n((155)) \nchildhood, that they mourn its passing, and continue to invoke, in an age that is no longer made for it, that great shade of \nformer times, certainly proves their fidelity. But such conservative zeal confirms me in my purpose and gives me the \nconfidence to do what I set out to do. \nBetween archaeological analysis and the history of ideas there are a great many points of divergence. I shall try shortly \nto establish four differences that seem to me to be of the utmost importance. They concern the attribution of innovation, \nthe analysis of contradictions, comparative descriptions, and the mapping of transformations. I hope that by examining \n",

    "chunk_full": "these different points we will be able to grasp the specific qualities of archaeological analysis, and that we may be able to \nmeasure its descriptive capacity. For the moment, however, I should like to lay down a few principles. \n \n1.Archaeology tries to define not the thoughts, representations, images, themes, preoccupations that are concealed \nor revealed in dis-courses; but those discourses themselves, those discourses as practices obeying certain rules. It does \nnot treat discourse as document, as a sign of something else, as an element that ought to be transparent, but whose \nunfortunate opacity must often be pierced if one is to reach at last the depth of the essential in the place in which it is \nheld in reserve; it is concerned with discourse in its own volume, as a monument. It is not an interpretative discipline: \nit does not seek another, better-hidden discourse. It refuses to be 'allegorical'. \n \n2.Archaeology does not seek to rediscover th.e continuous, insensible transition that relates discourses, on a gentle \nslope, to what precedes them, surrounds them, or follows them. It does not await the moment when, on the basis of \nwhat they were not yet, they became what they are; nor the moment when, the solidity of their figure crumbling away, \nthey will gradually lose their identity. On the contrary, its problem is to define discourses in their specificity; to show \nin what way the set of rules that they put into operation is irreducible to any other; to follow them the whole length of \ntheir exterior ridges, in order to underline them the better. It does not proceed, in slow pro-gression, from the confused \nfield of opinion to the uniqueness of the \n \n \n((156)) \nsystem or the definitive stability of science; it is not a 'doxology'; but a differential analysis of the modalities of \ndiscourse. \n3.Archaeology is not ordered in accordance with the sovereign figure of the oeuvres; it does not try to grasp the \nmoment in which the oeuvre emerges on the anonymous horizon. It does not wish to rediscover the enigmatic point at \nwhich the individual and the social are inverted into one another. It is neither a psychology, nor a sociology, nor more \ngenerally an anthropology of creation.. The oeuvre is not for archaeology a relevant division, even if it is a matter of \nreplacing it in its total context or in the network of causalities that support it. It defines types of rules for discursive \npractices that run through individual oeuvres, sometimes govern them entirely, and dominate them to such an extent \nthat nothing eludes them; but which sometimes, too, govern only part of it. The authority of the creative subject, as \nthe raison d'etre of an oeuvre and the principle of its unity, is quite alien to it. \n4.Lastly, archaeology does not try to restore what has been thought, wished, aimed at, experienced, desired by men \nin the very moment at which they expressed it in discourse; it does not set out to recapture that elusive nucleus in \nwhich the author and the oeuvre exchange identities; in which thought still remains nearest to one-self, in the as yet \nunaltered form of the same, and in which language (langage) has n.ot yet been deployed in the spatial, successive \ndispersion. of discourse. In other words, it does not try to repeat what has been said by reaching it in its very identity. \nIt does not claim to efface itself in the ambiguous modesty of a reading that would bring back, in all its purity, the \ndistant, precarious, almost effaced light of the origin. It is nothing more than a rewriting: that is, in the preserved form \nof exteriority, a regulated transformation of what has already been written. It is not a return to the innermost secret of \nthe origin; it is the systematic description of a discourse-object. \n \n \n((157)) \n2. THE ORIGINAL And THE REGULAR \nIn general, the history of ideas deals with the field of discourses as a domain with two values; any element located there \nmay be characterized as old or new; traditional or original; conforming to an average type or deviant. One can \ndistinguish. therefore between two categories of formulation: those that are highly valued and relatively rare, which \nappear for the first time, which have no similar antecedents, which may serve as models for others, and which to this \nextent deserve to be regarded as creations; and those, ordinary, everyday, solid, that are not responsible for themselves, \n",

To each of \nthese two groups the history of ideas gives a status; and it does not subject them to the same analysis: in describing the \nfirst, it recounts the history of inventions, changes, transformations, it shows how truth freed itself from error, how \nconsciousness awoke from its successive slumbers, how new forms rose up i.n turn to produce the landscape that we \nknow today; it is the task of the historian to rediscover on the basis of these isolated points, these successive ruptures, the \ncontinuous line of an evolution. The second group, on the other hand, reveals history as inertia and weight, as a slow \naccumulation of the past, a silent \n \n \n((158)) \nsedimentation of things said; in this second group, statements must he treated by weight and in accordance with what \nthey have in common; their unique occurrence may be neutralized; the importance of their author's identity, the time and \nplace of their appearance are also diminished; on the other hand, it is their extent that must be measured; the extent of \ntheir repetition in time and place, the channels by which they are diffused, the groups in which they circulate; the general \nhorizon that they outline for men's thought, the limits that they impose on it; and how, in characterizing a period, they \nmake it possible to distinguish it from others; one then describes a series of overall figures. In the first case, the history \nof ideas describes a succession of events in thought; in the second, there are uninterrupted expanses of effects; in the \nfirst, one reconstitutes the emergence of truths of forms; in the second, one re-establishes forgotten solidities, and refers \ndiscourses to their relativity. \nIt is true that, between these two authorities, the history of ideas is continuously determining relations; neither \nanalysis is ever found in its pure state; it describes conflicts between the old and the new, the resistance of the acquired, \nthe repression that it exercises over what has so far never been said, the coverings by which it masks it, the oblivion to \nwhich it sometimes succeeds in confining it; but it also describes the conditions, which, obscurely and at a distance, will \nfacilitate the emergence of future discourses; it describes the repercussions of discoveries, the speed and extent of their \ndiffusion, the slow processes of replacement or the sudden upheavals that overthrow familiar language (langage); it \ndescribes the integration of the new in the already structured field of the acquired, the progressive fall from the original \ninto the traditional, or, again, the reappearances of the already-said, and the uncovering of the original. But this \nintersection does not prevent it from always maintaining a bipolar analysis of the old and the new. An analysis that \nreinvests in the empirical element of history, and in each of its stages, the problematic of the origin: in every æuvre, in \nevery hook, in the smallest text, the problem is to rediscover the point of rupture, to establish, with the greatest possible \nprecision, the division between the implicit density of the already-said, a perhaps involuntary fidelity to acquired \nopinion, the law of discursive fatalities, and the vivacity of creation, the leap into irreducible difference. Although this \ndescription \n \n((159)) \nof originalities may seem obvious enough, it poses two very different methodological problems; that of resemblance and \nthat of procession. It presupposes, in effect, that one can establish a sort of single, great series in which every \nformulation would assume a date in accordance with homogeneous chronological guide-lines. But, to examine the \nquestion more closely, does Grimm, with his law of vowel-gradations, precede Bopp (who quoted him, used him, \napplied and modified what he said) in the same way and on the same temporal line; and did Cceurdoux and Anquetil-\nDuperron (in observing analogies between Greek and Sanskrit) anticipate the definition of the Indo-European languages, \nand precede the founders of comparative grammar? Was Saus-sure 'preceded' by Peirce and his semiotics, by Arnauld \nand Lancelot with the Classical analysis of the sign, and by the Stoics and the theory of the 'signifier', in the same series \nand in accordance with the same mode of anteriority? Precession is not an irreducible and primary donnee; it cannot play \nthe role of an absolute measure that makes it possible to gauge all discourse and to distinguish the original from the \nrepetitive. The mapping of antecedents is not enough, in itself, to determine a discursive order; on the contrary, it is \nsubordinated to the discourse that one is analysing, at the level that one chooses, on the scale that one establishes. By \ndeploying discourse throughout a calendar, and by giving a date to each of its elements, one does not obtain a definitive \nhierarchy of precessions and originalities; this hierarchy is never more than relative to the systems of discourse that it \nsets out to evaluate. \nSimilarly, the resemblance between two or several successive formulations also poses a whole series of problems. In \nwhat sense and in accordance with what criteria can one affirm: 'this has been said'; 'the same thing can already he found \nin this or that text', etc.? What is identity, partial or total, in the order of discourse?

Identity is not a \n((160)) \ncriterion even when it is exhaustive; even less so when it is partial, when words are not used each time in the same sense, \nor when the same nucleus of meaning is apprehended through different words: to what extent can one affirm that it is the \nsame organicist theme that emerges in the so very different discourses and vocabularies of Buffon, Jussieu, and Cuvier? \nAnd, inversely, can one say that the word 'organization' has the same meaning in the work of Daubenton, Blumenbach, \nand Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire? Generally speaking, does one find the same type of resemblance between Cuvier and \nDarwin, and between Cuvier and Linnaeus (or Aristotle)? There is no immediately recognizable resemblance between the \nformulations: their analogy is an effect of the discursive field in which it is mapped. \nIt is not legitimate, then, to demand, point-blank, of the texts that one is studying their title to originality, and whether \nthey really possess those degrees of nobility that are measured here by the absence of ancestors.

At the level in which \nthey are, the originality/banality opposition is therefore not relevant: between an initial formulation and the sentence, \nwhich, years, centuries later, repeats it more or less exactly, it establishes no hierarchy of value; it makes no radical \ndifference.

In this sense, regularity is not in opposition to irregularity, which, in the \nmargins of current opinion or the most frequent texts, characterizes the deviant statement (abnormal, prophetic, retarded, \npathological, or the product of genius); it designates, for every verbal performance (extraordinary, or banal, unique in its \nown kind or endlessly repeated), the set of conditions in which the enunciative function operates, and which guarantees \nand defines its existence. In this sense, regularity does not characterize a certain central position between the ends of a \nstatistical curve — it is not valid therefore as an index of frequency or probability; it specifies an effective field of \nappearance. Every statement bears a certain regularity and it cannot be dissociated from it. One must not therefore \noppose the regularity of a statement with the irregularity of another (that may he less expected, more unique, richer in. \ninnovation), but to other regularities that characterize other statements. \nArchaeology is not in search of inventions; and it remains unmoved at the moment (a very moving one, I admit) when \nfor the first time someone was sure of some truth; it does not try to restore the light of those joyful mornings. But neither \nis it concerned with the average phenomena of opinion, with the dull grey of what everyone at a particular period might \nrepeat. What it seeks in the texts of Linnaeus or Buffon, Petty or Ricardo, Pinel or Bichat, is not to draw up a list of \nfounding saints; it is to uncover the regularity of a discursive practice. A practice that is in operation, in the same way, in \nthe work of their predecessors; a practice that takes account in their work not only of the most original affirmations \n(those that no one else dreamt of before them), but also of those that they borrowed, even copied, from their \npredecessors. A discovery is no less regular, from the enunciative point of view, than the text that repeats an.d diffuses \nit; regularity is no less operant, no less effective and active, in a banal as in a unique forma-tion. In. such a description \none cannot admit a difference in nature between creative statements (which reveal something new, which emit hitherto \nunknown information, and which are 'active' in the same way) and imitative statements (which receive and repeat \ninformation, an.d remain, as it were, 'passive'). The field of statements is not a group of inert areas broken up by fecund \nmoments; it is a domain that is active throughout. \n((162)) \nThis analysis of enunciative regularities opens up in several directions that one day perhaps will be explored with \ngreater care. \n \n1. A group of statements is characterized, then, by a certain form of regularity, without it being either necessary or \npossible to distinguish between what is new and what is not. But these regularities — we shall come hack to them later — \nare not given once and for all; the same regularity is not to be found at work in Tournefort and Darwin, Lancelot and \nSaussure, Petty and Keynes. There are, then, homogeneous fields of enunciative regularities (they characterize a \ndiscursive forma-tion), but these fields are different from one another. The movement from one field of enunciative \nregularities to another need not be accompanied by corresponding changes at all other levels of discourse. There are \nverbal performances that are identical from the point of view of grammar (vocabulary, syntax, and the language (langue) \nin general); that are also identical. from the point of view of logic (from the point of view of propositional structure, or of \nthe deductive system in which it is placed) ; but which. are enunciatively different. Thus the formation of the quantitative \nrelation between prices and monetary mass in circulation may be expressed in the same words — or synonymous words \n— and be obtained by the same reasoning; but it is not enunciatively identical in Gresham or Locke and the nineteenth-\ncentury marginalists; it does not belong in each case to the same system of formation of objects and concepts. We must \ndistinguish, then, between linguistic ana-logy (or translatability), logical identity (or equivalence), and enunciative \nhomogeneity. It is with these homogeneities and these alone that archaeology is concerned. It can see the appearance of a \nnew discursive practice through verbal formulations that remain linguistically analogous or logically equivalent (by \ntaking up again, sometimes word for word, the old theory of sentence-attribution and verb-copula the Port-Royal \ngrammarians opened up an enunciative regularity whose specificity it is the duty of archaeology to describe). Inversely, it \nmay ignore differences of vocabulary, it may pass over semantic fields or different deductive organizations, if it is \ncapable of recognizing in each case, despite their heterogeneity, a certain enunciative regularity (from this point of view, \nthe theory of the language (langage) of action, the search for the origin of languages (longues), the establishment of \nprimitive \n((163)) \n",

One can no longer say that a \ndiscovery, the formula-tion of a general principle, or the definition of a project, inaugurates, in a massive way, a new \nphase in the history of discourse. One no longer has to seek that point of absolute origin or total revolution on the basis of \nwhich everything is organized, everything becomes possible and necessary, everything is effaced in order to begin again. \nOne is deal-ing with. events of different types and levels, caught up in distinct historical webs; the establishment of an \nenunciative homogeneity in no way implies that, for decades or centuries to come, men will say and think the same thing; \nnor does it imply the definition, explicit or not, of a number of principles from which everything else would flow, as \ninevitable consequences. Enunciative homogeneities (and heterogeneities) intersect with linguistic continuities (and \nchanges), with logical identities (and differences), without any of them proceeding at the same pace or necessarily \naffecting one another. But there must exist between them a number of relations and inter-dependences whose no doubt \nhighly complex domain must be described. \n \n2. Another direction of research: the interior hierarchies within enunciative regularities. We have seen that every \nstatement belongs to a certain regularity — that consequently none can be regarded as pure creation, as the marvellous \ndisorder of genius. But we have also seen that no statement can be regarded as inactive, and be valid as the scarcely real \nshadow or transfer of the initial statement. The whole enunciative field is both regular and alerted: it never sleeps; the \nleast statement — the most discreet or the most banal — puts into operation a whole set of rules in accordance with which \nits object, its modality, the concepts that it employs, and the strategy of which it is a part, are formed. These rules are \nnever given in a formulation, they 'traverse' formulations, and set up for them a space of coexistence; one cannot therefore \nrediscover the unique statement that would articulate them for themselves. However, certain groups of statements put \nthese rules into operation in their most general and most widely applicable form; \n \n((164)) \nusing them as a starting-point, one can see how other objects, other concepts, other enunciative modalities, or other \nstrategic choices may be formed on the basis of rules that are less general and whose domain of application is more \nspecified. One can thus describe a tree of enunciative derivation: at its base are the statements that put into operation rules \nof formation in their most extended form; at its summit, and after a number of branchings, are the statements that put into \noperation the same regularity, but one more delicately articulated, more clearly delimited and localized in its extension. \nArchaeology — and this is one of its principal themes — may thus constitute the tree of derivation of a discourse. That \nof Natural History, for example. It will place at the root, as governing statements, those that concern the definition of \nobservable structures and the field of possible objects, those that prescribe the forms of description and the perceptual \ncodes that it can use, those that reveal the most general possibilities of characterization, and thus open up a whole domain \nof concepts to be constructed, and, lastly, those that, while constituting a strategic choice, leave room for the greatest \nnumber of subsequent options. And it will find, at the ends of the branches, or at various places in the whole, a \nburgeoning of `discoveries' (like that of fossil series), conceptual transformations (like the new definition of the genus), \nthe emergence of new notions (like that of mammals or organ-ism), technical improvements (principles for organizing \ncollections, methods of classification and nomenclature). This derivation from governing statements must not be confused \nwith a deduction that is made on the basis of axioms; nor must it be identified with the germination of a general idea, or a \nphilosophical nucleus whose significance emerges gradually in experience or precise conceptualizations; lastly, it must \nnot he taken as a psychological genesis based on a discovery whose consequences and possibilities gradually develop and \nunfold. It is different from all these courses, and it must be described in its autonomy. One can thus describe the \narchaeological derivations of Natural History without beginning with its undemonstrable axioms or its fundamental \nthemes (the continuity of nature, for example), and without taking as one's starting-point and guiding-thread the first dis-\ncoveries or the first approaches (those of Tournefort before those of Linnaeus, those of Jonston before those of \nTournefort). The archaeo- \n \n((165)) \nlogical order is neither that of systematici ties, nor that of chronological successions. \nBut one can see that a whole domain of possible questions is open-ing up here. For these different \norders cannot be specific and autonomous; there must be relations and dependences between them. \nFor certain discursive formations, the archaeological order is perhaps not very different from the \nsystematic order, as in other cases it may follow the thread of chronological successions. These \nparallelisms (contrary to the distortions met with elsewhere) are worthy of analysis. In any case, it is \nimportant not to confuse these different orders, not to seek in an 'initial' discovery or in the \noriginality of a formulation the principle from which everything can be deduced and derived; not to \nseek in a general principle the law of enunciative regularities or individual inventions; not to demand \nof archaeological derivation that it reproduce the order of time or reveal a deductive schema. \n \nNothing would be more false than to see in the analysis of dis-cursive formations an attempt at \ntotalitarian periodization, whereby from a certain moment and for a certain time, everyone would \n",

But \none can adopt the contrary course, and, by following the thread of analogies and symbols, rediscover a thematic that is \nmore imaginary than discursive, more affective than rational, and less close to the concept than to desire; its force \nanimates the most opposed figures, but only to melt them at once into a slowly transformable unity; what one then dis-\ncovers is a plastic continuity, the movement of a meaning that is embodied in various representations, images, and \nmetaphors. These coherences may be thematic or systematic, explicit or not: they can be sought at the level of \nrepresentations that were conscious in the speak-ing subject, but which his discourse — for circumstantial reasons or \nbecause of an inadequacy in the very form of his language (langage) — failed to express; it can also be sought in \nstructures that would have constrained the author the more he constructed them, and which would have imposed on him, \nwithout his realizing it, postulates, operational schemata, linguistic rules, a set of affirmations and fundamental beliefs, \ntypes of images, or a whole logic of the fantastic. Lastly, there are coherences that one establishes at the level of an \nindividual — his biography, or the unique circumstances of his discourse — but one can also establish them in \naccordance with broader guide-lines, one can give them the collective, diachronic dimensions of a period, a genera] form \nof consciousness, a type of society, a set of traditions, an imaginary landscape common to a whole culture. In all these \nforms, a coherence discovered in this way always plays the same role: it shows that immediately visible contradictions \nare merely surface reflections; and that this play of dispersed light must be concentrated into a single focus. Contradiction \nis the illusion of a unity that hides itself or is hidden: it has its place only in the gap between consciousness and \nunconsciousness, thought and the text, the ideality and the contingent \n((168)) \nbody of expression. In any case, analysis must suppress contradiction as best it can. \nAt the end of this work, only residual contradictions remain — accidents, defects, mistakes — or, on the contrary, as if \nthe entire analysis had been carried out in secrecy and in spite of itself, the fundamental contradiction emerges: the \nbringing into play, at the very origin of the system, of incompatible postulates, intersections of irreconcilable influences, \nthe first diffraction of desire, the economic and political conflict that opposes a society to itself, all this, instead of \nappearing as so many superficial elements that must be reduced, is finally revealed as an organizing principle, as the \nfounding, secret law that accounts for all minor contradictions and gives them a firm foundation: in short, a model for all \nthe other oppositions. Such a contradiction, far from being an appearance or accident of discourse, far from being that \nfrom which it must be freed if its truth is at last to be revealed, constitutes the very law of its existence: it is on the basis \nof such a contradiction that discourse emerges, and it is in order both to translate it and to overcome it that discourse \nbegins to speak; it is in order to escape that contradiction, whereas contradiction is ceaselessly reborn through dis-course, \nthat discourse endlessly pursues itself and endlessly begins again; it is because contradiction is always anterior to the \ndiscourse, and because it can never therefore entirely escape it, that discourse changes, undergoes transformation, and \nescapes of itself from its own continuity. Contradiction, then, functions throughout discourse, as the principle of its \nhistoricity. \nThe history of ideas recognizes, therefore, two levels of contradiction: that of appearances, which is resolved in the \nprofound unity of discourse; and that of foundations, which gives rise to discourse itself. In relation to the first level of \ncontradiction, discourse is the ideal figure that must be separated from their accidental presence, from their too visible \nbody; in relation to the second, discourse is the empirical figure that contradictions may take up and whose apparent \ncohesion must be destroyed, in order to rediscover them at last in their irruption and violence. Discourse is the path from \none contradiction to another: if it gives rise to those that can be seen, it is because it obeys that which it hides. To analyse \ndiscourse is to hide and reveal contradictions; it is to show the play that they set up within it; it is to manifest \n \n \n((169)) \nhow it can express them, embody them, or give them a temporary appearance. \nFor archaeological analysis, contradictions are neither appearances to be overcome, nor secret principles to be \nuncovered. They are objects to be described for themselves, without any attempt being made to discover from what point \nof view they can be dissipated, or at what level they can be radicalized and effects become causes. Let us take a simple \nexample, one that has already been mentioned several times: in the eighteenth century, Linnaeus's fixist principle was \ncontradicted, not so much by the discovery of the Peloria, which changed only its modes of application, but by a number \nof 'evolutionist' affirmations that are to be found in the works of Buffon, Diderot, Bordeu, Maillet, and many others. \nArchaeological analysis does not consist in showing that beneath this opposition, at a more essential level, everyone \naccepted a number of fundamental theses (the continuity and plenitude of nature, the correlation between recent forms \nand climate, the almost imperceptible transition from the non-living to the living); nor does it consist in showing that such \nan opposition reflects, in the particular domain of Natural History, a more general conflict that divides all eighteenth-\ncentury knowledge and thought (the conflict between the theme of an ordered creation, acquired once and for all, \n",

By deriving in this way the contradiction between two theses from a certain domain of \nobjects, from its delimitations and divisions, one does not discover a point of conciliation. But neither does one transfer \nit to a more fundamental level; one defines the locus in which it takes place; it reveals the place where the two branches \nof the alternative join; it localizes the divergence and the place where the two discourses are juxtaposed. The theory of \nstructure is not a common postulate, a basis of general belief shared by Linnaeus and Buffon, a solid, fundamental \naffirmation that throws back to the level of a subsidiary debate the conflict of evolutionism and fixism; it is the principle \nof their incompatibility, the law that governs their derivation and their coexistence. By taking contradictions as objects to \nbe described, archaeological analysis does not try to discover in their place a common form or theme, it tries to \ndetermine the extent and form of the gap that separates them. In relation to a history of ideas that attempts to melt \ncontradictions in the semi-nocturnal unity of an overall figure, or which attempts to transmute them into a general, ab-\nstract, uniform principle of interpretation or explanation, archaeology describes the different spaces of dissension. \nIt ceases, therefore, to treat contradictions as a general function operating, in the same way, at all levels of discourse, \nand which analysis should either suppress entirely or lead back to a primary, constitutive form: for the great game of \ncontradiction — present under innumerable guises, then suppressed, and finally restored in the major conflict in which it \nculminates — it substitutes the analysis of different types of contradiction, different levels in accordance with which it \ncan be mapped, different functions that it can exercise. \nDifferent types first of all. Some contradictions are localized only at the level of propositions and assertions, without \nin any way affecting the body of enunciative rules that makes them possible: thus in the eighteenth century the thesis of \nthe animal character of fossils was opposed by the more traditional thesis of their mineral nature; the consequences that \ncan be drawn from these two theses are certainly very numerous and far-reaching; but it can be shown that they \noriginated in the same discursive formation, at the same point, and in accordance with the same conditions of operation \nof the enunciative function; they are contradictions that are archaeologically derived, and \n((171)) \nwhich constitute a terminal state. Others, on the contrary, go beyond the bounds of a discursive formation, and they \noppose theses that do not belong to the same conditions of enunciation: thus Linnaeus's fixism is contradicted by \nDarwin's evolutionism, but only to the extent that one neutralizes the difference between Natural History, to which the \nfirst belongs, and biology, to which the second belongs. They are extrinsic contradictions that reflect the opposition \nbetween distinct dis-cursive formations. For archaeological description (ignoring, for the moment, any possible \nprocedural differences), this opposition constitutes the terminus a quo, whereas derived contradictions constitute the \nterminus ad quem of analysis. Between these two extremes, archaeological description describes what might be called \nintrinsic contradictions: those that are deployed in the discursive formation itself, and which, originating at one point in \nthe system of formations, reveal sub-systems: hence, to keep to the example of eighteenth-century Natural History, the \ncontradiction between `methodical' analyses and 'systematic' analyses. The opposition here is not a terminal one: they are \nnot two contradictory propositions about the same object, they are not two incompatible uses of the same concept, but \ntwo ways of forming statements, both characterized by certain objects, certain positions of subjectivity, certain concepts, \nand certain strategic choices. Yet these systems are not primary ones: for it can be shown to what extent they both derive \nfrom a single positivity, that of Natural History. It is these intrinsic oppositions that are relevant to archaeological \nanalysis. \nThen different levels. An intrinsic archaeological contradiction is not a fact, purely and simply, that it is enough to \nstate as a principle or explain as an effect. It is a complex phenomenon that is distributed over different levels of the \ndiscursive formation. Thus, for systematic Natural History and methodical Natural History, which were in con-stant \nopposition for a good part of the eighteenth century, one can recognize: an inadequation of the objects (in the one case \none describes the general appearance of the plant; in the other certain predetermined variables; in the one case, one \ndescribes the totality of the plant, or at least its most important parts, in the other one describes a number of elements \nchosen arbitrarily for their taxonomic convenience; some-times one takes account of the plant's different states of growth \nand maturity, at others one confines one's attention to a single moment, a \n \n \n",

These forms of opposition do not all play the same role in discursive practice: they are not, in a \nhomogeneous way, obstacles to overcome or a principle of growth. In any case, it is not enough to seek in them the cause \neither of the deceleration or the acceleration of history; time is not introduced into the truth and ideality of discourse on \nthe basis of the empty, general form of opposition. These oppositions are always particular functional stages. Some of \nthem bring about an additional development of the enunciative field: they open up sequences of argumentation, \nexperiment, verification, and various inferences; they make possible the determination of new objects, they arouse new \nenunciative modalities, they define new concepts or modify the field of application of those that already exist: but without \nanything being modified in the system of positivity of the discourse (this was the case in the discussions of the \neighteenth-century naturalists on the frontier between the mineral and the vegetal, or on the boundaries of life or nature \nand the origin of fossils); such additive processes may remain decisively open or closed by a demonstration that refutes \nthem or a discovery that puts them out of operation. Others induce a reorganization of the discursive field: they pose the \nquestion of the possible translation of one group of statements into another, of the point of coherence that might articulate \none on another, of their integration in a more general space (thus the system/method opposition among eighteenth-century \nnaturalists induces a series of attempts to recreate both of them in a \n((173)) \nsingle form of description, to give to the method the rigour and. regularity of the system, to coincide the arbitrariness of \nthe system with the concrete analyses of the method); they are not new objects, new concepts, new enunciative modalities \nthat are added in a linear fashion to the old; but objects of another (more general or more particular) level, concepts that \nhave another structure and another field of application, enunciations of another type, without, however, altering the rules \nof formation. Other oppositions play a critical role: they put into operation the existence of the `acceptability' of the \ndiscursive practice; they define the point of its effective impossibility and of its historical reflexion (thus the description., \nin Natural History itself, of organic similarities and functions that operate, through anatomical variables, in definite \nconditions of existence, no longer permits, as an autonomous discursive formation at least, a Natural. History that is a \ntaxonomic science of beings on the basis of their visible ch.aracters). \nA discursive formation is not, therefore, an ideal, continuous, smooth text that runs beneath the multiplicity of \ncontradictions, and resolves them in the calm unity of coherent thought; nor is it the surface in which, in a thousand \ndifferent aspects, a contradiction is reflected that is always in retreat, but everywhere dominant. It is rather a space of \nmultiple dissensions; a set of different oppositions whose levels and roles must be described. Archaeological analysis, \nthen, erects the primacy of a contradiction that has its model in the simultaneous affirmation and negation of a single \nproposition. But the reason for this is not to even out oppositions in th.e general forms of thought and to pacify them by \nforce, by a recourse to a constructing a priori. On the contrary, its purpose is to map, in a particular discursive practice, \nthe point at which they are constituted, to define the form that they assume, the relations that they have with each other, \nand the domain that they govern. In short, its purpose is to maintain discourse in all its many irregularities; and \nconsequently to suppress the theme of a contradiction uniformly lost and rediscovered, resolved and forever rising again, \nin the undifferentiated element of the Logos. \n \n((174)) \n \n \n4.

In archaeological analysis comparison is always limited and regional. Far from wishing to reveal general forms, \narchaeology tries to outline particular configurations. When one compares General Gram-mar, the Analysis of Wealth, \nand Natural History in the Classical period, it is not in order to regroup three manifestations — particularly charged with \nexpressive value, and hitherto strangely neglected — of a mentality that was general in the seventeenth and eighteenth \ncenturies; it is not in order to reconstitute, on the basis of a reduced model and a particular domain, the forms of \nrationality that operated in the whole of Classical science; it is not even to illuminate the less well-known profile of what \nwe thought was a familiar cultural face. Our aim was not to show that men in the eighteenth century were generally \nspeaking more interested in order than in history, in classification than development, in signs than the mechanisms of \ncausality. Our aim was to reveal a well-determined set of discursive formations that have a number of describable \nrelations between them. These relations do not spill over into adjacent domains and they cannot be brought gradually \ncloser to the totality of contemporary discourses, even less to what is usually called 'the Classical spirit'; they are closely \nconfined to the triad being stud-ied, and are valid only in the domain specified. This interdiscursive group is itself, in its \ngroup form, related to other types of discourse (with the analysis of representation, the general theory of signs, and \n'ideology' on the one hand; and with mathematics, algebraic analysis, and the attempt to establish a mathesis on the \nother). They are those internal and external relations that characterize Natural History, the Analysis of Wealth, and \nGeneral Grammar, as a specific group, and make it possible to recognize in them an interdiscursive configuration. \nThere are those who would say: 'Why did you not speak of cosmology, physiology, or Biblical exegesis? Could not \npre-Lavoisier chemistry, or Euler's mathematics, or Vico's history have invalidated all the analyses to be found in The \nOrder of Things? Are there not, in the inventive richness of the eighteenth century, many other ideas that do not fit into \n \n \n((176)) \nthe rigid framework of archaeology?' To such people, with their quite legitimate impatience, to all the counter-examples \nwhich, as I am very well aware, they could supply, I will reply: of course, I not only admit that my analysis is limited, I \nwant it so; I have made it so. What for me would he a counter-example would be precisely the possibility of saying: all \nthese relations that you have described in three particular formations, all these networks in which the theories of \nattribution, articulation, designation, and derivation are articulated upon one another, all that taxonomy that rests on a \ndiscontinuous characterization and a continuity of order are found uniformly, and in the same way, in geometry, rational \nmechanics, the physiology of humours and germs, Biblical criticism, and emergent crystallography. This would, in fact, \nprove that I did not describe, as I claimed to have done, a region of interpositivity; I would have characterized the spirit or \nscience of a period — the very thing to which my whole enterprise is opposed. The relations that I have described are \nvalid in order to define a particular configuration: they are not signs to describe the face of a culture in its totality. It is the \nfriends of the Weltanschauung who will be disappointed; I insist that the description that I have undertaken is quite \ndifferent from theirs. What, for them, is a lacuna, an omission, an error is, for me, a deliberate, methodical exclusion. \nBut one might also say: you have compared General. Grammar with Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth. But \nwhy not with. History as it was practised at the time, with Biblical criticism, with rhetoric, with the theory of the fine \narts?

Of course, these \nquestions would be legitimate \n \n((178)) \n(some of them, at least).

Not that I wish to deny their existence, or deny that they could ever be the object of a description. But \nrather that I have tried to step back from them, to shift the level of attack of the analysis, to reveal what made them \npossible; to map the points at which the projection of one concept upon another could take place, to fix the isomorphism \nthat made a transference of methods or techniques possible, to show the proximities, sysmmetries, or analogies that have \nmade generalizations possible; in short, to describe the field of vectors and of differential receptivity (of permeability and \nimpermeability) that has been a condition of historical possibility for the interplay of exchanges. A configuration of \ninterpositivity is not a group of neighbouring disciplines; it is not only an observable phenomenon of resemblance; it is \nnot only the overall relation of several discourses to this or that other discourse; it is the law of their communications. \nBecause Rousseau and others reflected in turn on the ordering of the species and the origin of the languages, this does not \nmean that relations were made and exchanges occurred between taxonomy and grammar; or because Turgot, after Law \nand Petty, wished to treat coinage as a sign, that economy and the theory of language were brought close together and that \ntheir history still bears the trace of these attempts. It means rather — if, at least, one is attempting to make an \narchaeological description — that the respective arrangements of these three positivities were such that, at the level of \nuuvres, authors, individual existences, projects, and attempts, one can find such exchanges. \n \n3. Archaeology also reveals relations between discursive formations and non-discursive domains (institutions, political \nevents, economic \n((180)) \npractices and processes). These rapprochements are not intended to uncover great cultural continuities, nor to isolate \nmechanisms of causality. Before a set of enunciative facts, archaeology does not ask what could have motivated them (the \nsearch for contexts of formulation); nor does it seek to rediscover what is expressed in them (the task of hermeneutics); it \ntries to determine how the rules of formation that govern it — and which characterize the positivity to which it belongs — \nmay be linked to non-discursive systems: it seeks to define specific forms of articulation. \nLet us take the example of clinical medicine, whose establishment at the end of the eighteenth century is contemporary \nwith a number of political events, economic phenomena, and institutional changes. Between these facts and the \norganization of hospital medicine, it is easy enough to suspect the existence of certain links, at least if one operates \nlargely on intuition. But how can such links be analysed? A symbolic analysis would see in the organizing of clinical \nmedicine, and in the historical processes that were concomitant with it, two simultaneous expressions, which reflect and \nsymbolize one another, which serve each other as a mirror, and whose meanings are caught up in an end-less play of \nreflexion: two expressions that express nothing but the form that they share. Thus medical ideas of organic solidarity, \nfunctional cohesion, tissular communication — and. the abandonment of the classificatory principle of diseases in favour \nof an analysis of the bodily interactions — might correspond (in order to reflect them, but also to he reflected in them) to \na political practice that is discovering, beneath still feudal stratifications, relations of a functional type, economic con-\nnexions, a society whose dependences and reciprocities were to pro-vide, in the form of society, the analogon of life. A \ncausal analysis, on the other hand, would try to discover to what extent political changes, or ecomonic processes, could \ndetermine the consciousness of scientists — the horizon and direction of their interest, their system of values, their way of \nperceiving things, the style of their rationality; thus, at a period in which industrial capitalism was beginning to \nrecalculate its manpower requirements, disease took a on social dimension: the maintenance of health, cure, public \nassistance for the poor and sick, the search for pathological causes and sites, became a collective responsibility that must \nbe assumed by the state. Hence the value placed upon \n((181)) \nthe body as a work tool, the care to rationalize medicine on the basis of the other sciences, the efforts to maintain the \nlevel of health of a population, the attention paid to therapy, after-care, and the recording of long-term phenomena. \nArchaeology situates its analysis at another level: the phenomena of expression, reflexions, and symbolization are for \nit merely the effects of an overall reading in search of formal analogies or translations of meaning; as for causal \nrelations, they may be assigned to the level of the context or of the situation and their effect on the speaking subject; \nboth, in any case, can be mapped once one has defined the positivities in which they appear and the rules in accordance \nwith which these positivities have been formed. The field of relations that characterizes a discursive formation is the \nlocus in which symbolizations and effects may he perceived, situated, and determined. If archaeology brings medical \ndiscourse closer to a number of practices, it is in order to discover far less 'immediate' relations than expression, but far \nmore direct relations than those of a causality communicated through the consciousness of the speaking subjects. It \nwishes to show not how political practice has determined the meaning and form of medical discourse, but how and in \nwhat form it takes part in its conditions of emergence, insertion, and functioning. This relation may he assigned to \nseveral levels. First to that of the division and delimitation of the medical object: not, of course, that it was political \npractice that from the early nineteenth century imposed on medicine such new objects as tissular lesions or the anatomo-\nphysiological correlations; but it opened up new fields for the mapping of medical objects (these fields are constituted by \nthe mass of the population administratively compartmented and supervised, gauged according to certain norms of life \nand health, and analysed according to documentary and statistical forms of registration; they are also constituted by the \n",

One can also see the appearance of this relation of political practice to medical discourse in the status accorded \nto the doctor, who becomes \n((182)) \nnot only the privileged, but also virtually the exclusive, enunciator of this discourse, in the form of institutional relation \nthat the doctor may have with the hospitalized patient or with his private practice, in the modalities of teaching and \ndiffusion that are prescribed or authorized for this knowledge. Lastly, one can grasp this relation in the function that is \nattributed to medical discourse, or in the role that is required of it, when it is a question of judging individuals, making \nadministrative decisions, laying down the norms of a society, translating — in order to 'resolve' or to conceal them — \nconflicts of another order, giving models of a natural type to analyses of society and to the practices that concern it. It is \nnot a question, then, of showing how the political practice of a given society constituted or modified the medical concepts \nand theoretical structure of pathology; but how medical discourse as a practice concerned with a particular field of \nobjects, finding itself in the hands of a certain number of statutorily designated individuals, and having certain functions \nto exercise in society, is articulated on practices that are external to it, and which are not themselves of a discursive order. \n \nIf in this analysis archaeology suspends the theme of expression and reflexion, if it refuses to see in discourse the \nsurface of the symbolic projection of events or processes that are situated elsewhere, it is not in order to rediscover a \ncausal sequence that might be described point by point, and which would make it possible to relate a discovery and an \nevent, or a concept and a social structure. But on the other hand if it suspends such a causal analysis, if it wishes to avoid \nthe necessary connexion through the speaking subject, it is not in order to guarantee the sovereign, sole independence of \ndiscourse; it is in order to discover the domain of existence and functioning of a discursive practice. In other words, the \narchaeological description of discourses is deployed in the dimension of a general history; it seeks to discover that whole \ndomain of institutions, economic processes, and social relations on which a discursive formation can be articulated; it \ntries to show how the autonomy of discourse and its specificity nevertheless do not give it the status of pure ideality and \ntotal historical independence; what it wishes to uncover is the particular level in which history can give place to definite \ntypes of discourse, which have their own type of historicity, and which are related to a whole set of various historicities. \n5. CHANGE And TRANSFORMATIONS \nLet us now turn to the archaeological description of change. Whatever theoretical criticisms one can make of the \ntraditional history of ideas, it does at least take as its essential theme the phenomena of temporal succession and \nsequence, analyses them in accordance with schemata of evolution, and thus describes the historical deployment of dis-\ncourses. Archaeology, however, seems to treat history only to freeze it. On the one hand, by describing discursive \nformations, it ignores the temporal relations that may he manifested in them; it seeks general rules that will he uniformly \nvalid, in the same way, and at every point in time: does it not, therefore, impose the constricting figure of a synchrony on \na development that may he slow and imperceptible? In this 'world of ideas', which is in itself so untrustworthy, in which \napparently the most stable figures disappear so quickly, but in which so many irregularities occur that are later accorded \ndefinitive status, in which the future always anticipates itself, whereas the past is constantly shifting, is not archaeology \nvalid as a sort of motionless thought? And, on the other hand, when it does have recourse to chronology, it is only, it \nseems, in order to fix, at the limits of the positivities, two pinpoints: the moment at which they are born and the moment \nat which they \n \n \n((184)) \ndisappear, as if duration was used only to fix this crude calendar, and was omitted throughout the analysis itself; as if time \nexisted only in the vacant moment of rupture, in that white, paradoxically atemporal crack in which one sudden \nformulation replaces another.

    "chunk_full": "avoided, and with it the possibility of a historical description disappears. Discourse is snatched from the law of \ndevelopment and established in a discontinuous atemporality. It is immobilized in fragments: precarious splinters of \neternity. But there is nothing one can do about it: several eternities succeeding one another, a play of fixed images \ndisappearing in turn, do not constitute either movement, time, or history. \nBut the problem must be examined in greater detail. \nLet us take first the apparent synchrony of discursive formations. One thing is true: it is no use establishing the rules in \nevery statement, and they cannot therefore he put into operation with every statement, they do not change each time; they \ncan he found at work in statements or groups of statements in widely separated periods. We have seen, for example, that \nfor nearly a century — from Tournefort to Jussieu — the various objects of Natural History obeyed the same rules of \nformation; we have seen that the theory of attribution is the same and plays the same role in the work of Lancelot, \nCondillac, and Destutt de Tracy. Moreover, we have seen that the order of statements based on archaeological derivation \ndid not necessarily reproduce the order of successions: one can find in Beauzee statements that are archeologically \nanterior to those to be found in. the Grammaire of Port-Royal. In such an analysis, therefore, there is a suspension of \ntemporal successions — or, to be more precise, of the calendar of formulations. But this suspension is intended precisely \nto reveal the relations that characterize the temporality of discursive formations and articulate them in series whose \nintersection in no way precludes analysis. \n \n(a) Archaeology defines the rules of formation of a group of state- \nments. In this way it shows how a succession of events may, in the same \n \n \n((185)) \norder in which it is presented, become an object of discourse, be recorded, described, explained, elaborated into concepts, \nand provide the opportunity for a theoretical choice. Archaeology analyses the degree and form of permeability of a \ndiscourse: it provides the principle of its articulation over a chain of successive events; it defines the operators by which \nthe events are transcribed into statements. It does not challenge, for example, the relation between the Analysis of Wealth \nand the great monetary fluctuations of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; it tries to show what, in these \ncrises, could be given as an object of discourse, how those crises could be conceptualized in such an object, how the \ninterests that were in conflict throughout these processes could deploy their strategy in them. Or again, it does not claim \nthat the cholera epidemic of 1832 was not an event that concerned medicine: it shows how clinical discourse put into \noperation such a body of rules that a whole domain of medical objects could then be reorganized, that a whole group of \nmethods of recording and nota-tion could be used, that the concept of inflammation could be abandoned and the old \ntheoretical problem of fevers could be resolved definitively. Archaeology does not deny the possibility of new statements \nin correlation with 'external' events. Its task is to show on what condition a correlation can exist between them, and what \nprecisely it consists of (what are its limits, its form, its code, its law of possibility). It does not try to avoid that mobility of \ndiscourses that makes them move to the rhythm of events; it tries to free the level at which it is set in motion — what \nmight he called the level of 'evential' engage-ment. (An engagement that is specific for every discursive formation, and \nwhich does not have the same rules, the same operators, or the same sensibility in, for example, the Analysis of Wealth \nand in Political Economy, in the old medicine of the 'constitutions' and in modern epidemiology.) \n \n(h) Moreover, all the rules of formation assigned by archaeology to a positivity do not have the same generality: some \nare more specific and derive from others. This subordination may be merely hierarchical but it may also involve a \ntemporal vector. Thus in General Grammar, the theory of the verb-attribution and that of the noun-articulation are linked \nto one another: and the second derives from the first, but \n \n \n((186)) \nwithout it being possible to determine an order of succession between them (other than the \ndeductive or rhetorical order that has been chosen for the expose). On the other hand, the analysis \nof the complement or the search for roots could appear (or reappear) only when the analysis of \nthe attributive sentence or the notion of the noun as an analytic sign of representation had been \ndeveloped. Another example: in the Classical period, the principle of the continuity of beings is \nimplied in the classification of species according to structural characters; and in this sense they \nare simultaneous; on the other hand, it is only when this classification is undertaken that the \nlacunae and gaps may be interpreted in the categories of a history of nature, of the earth, and of \nthe species. In other words, the archaeological ramification of the rules of formation is not a \nuniformly simultaneous network: there exist relations, branches, derivations that are temporally \nneutral; there exist others that imply a particular temporal direction.

Far from being indifferent to \nsuccession, archaeology maps the temporal vectors of derivation. \n \nArchaeology does not set out to treat as simultaneous what is given as successive; it does not \ntry to freeze time and to substitute for its flux of events correlations that outline a motionless \nfigure. What it suspends is the theme that succession is an absolute: a primary, indissociable \nsequence to which discourse is subjected by the law of its finitude; it is also the theme that there \nis in discourse only one form and only one level of succession. For these themes, it substitutes \nanalyses that reveal both the various forms of succession that are superposed in discourse (and by \nforms I do not simply mean the rhythms or causes, but the series themselves), and the way in \nwhich the successions thus specified are articulated. Instead of following the thread of an original \ncalendar, in relation to which one would establish the chronology of successive or simultaneous \nevents, that of short or lasting processes, that of momentary or permanent phenomena, one tries to \nshow how it is \n((187)) \npossible for there to be succession, and at what different levels distinct successions are to be found. To constitute an \narchaeological history of discourse, then, one must free oneself of two models that have for so long imposed their image: \nthe linear model of speech (and partly at least of writing), in which all events succeed one another, without any effect of \ncoincidence and superposition; and the model of the stream of consciousness whose presence always eludes itself in its \nopenness to the future and its retention of the past. Paradoxical as it may be, dis-cursive formations do not have the same \nmodel of historicity as the flow of consciousness or the linearity of language. Discourse, at least as analysed by \narchaeology, that is, at the level of its positivity, is not a consciousness that embodies its project in the external form of \nlanguage (langage); it is not a language (longue), plus a subject to speak it. It is a practice that has its own forms of \nsequence and succession. \nArchaeology is much more willing than the history of ideas to speak of discontinuities, ruptures, gaps, entirely new forms \nof positivity, and of sudden redistributions. The practice of political economy was, traditionally, to seek everything that \nled up to Ricardo, everything that could foreshadow his analyses, methods, and principal notions, every-thing that tended \nto make his discoveries more probable; the practice of the history of comparative grammar was to rediscover — beyond \nBopp and Rask — earlier research into the filiation and kinship of languages; it was to determine how much Anquetil-\nDuperron contributed towards the constitution of an Indo-European domain; it was to uncover the first comparison (made \nin 1769) of Sanskrit and Latin conjugations; it may even lead one back to Harris or Ramus. Archaeology proceeds in the \nopposite direction: it seeks rather to untie all those knots that historians have patiently tied; it increases differences, blurs \nthe lines of communication, and tries to make it more difficult to pass from one thing to another; it does not try to show \nthat the Physiocratic analysis of production foreshadowed that of Ricardo; it does not regard it as relevant to its own \nanalyses to say that Cceurdoux foreshadowed Bopp. \nWhat does this insistence on discontinuities correspond to? In fact, it \n \n \n((188)) \nis paradoxical only in relation to the practice of the historians of ideas. It is rather the history of ideas — with its concern \nfor continuities, transitions, anticipations, and foreshadowings — that plays with paradox. From Daubenton to Cuvier, \nfrom Anquetil to Bopp, from Graslin, Turgot, or Forbonnais to Ricardo — even such a chronologically small gap — the \ndifferences are innumerable: some are localized, others are more general; some concern methods, others concepts; \nsometimes they concern the domain of objects, at others the whole linguistic instrument. More striking still is the \nexample of medicine: in a quarter of a century, from 1790 to 1815, medical discourse changed more profoundly than \nsince the seventeenth century, probably than since the Middle Ages, and perhaps even since Greek medicine: a change \nthat revealed new objects (organic lesions, deep sites, tissular alterations, ways and forms of inter-organic diffusion, \nanatomoclinical signs and correlations), techniques of observation, of detection of the pathological site, recording; a new \nperceptual grid, and on almost entirely new descriptive vocabulary; new sets of concepts and nosographical distributions \n(century-old, sometimes age-old categories such as fever or constitution disappeared, and diseases that are perhaps as \n",

Those who say that archaeology invents \ndifferences in an arbitrary way can never have opened La Nosographic philosophique and the Traite des membranes. \nArchaeology is simply trying to take such differences seriously: to throw some light on the matter, to determine how \nthey are divided up, how they are entangled with one another, how they govern or are governed by one another, to which \ndistinct categories they belong; in short, to describe these differences, not to establish a system of differences between \nthem. If there is a paradox in archaeology, it is not that it increases differences, but that it refuses to reduce them — thus \ninverting the usual values. For the history of ideas, the appearance of difference indicates an error, or a trap; instead of \nexamining it, the clever historian must try to reduce it: to find beneath it a smaller difference, and beneath that an even \nsmaller one, and so on until he reaches the ideal limit, the non-difference of perfect continuity. Archaeology, on the \nother hand, takes as the object of its description what is usually regarded as an obstacle: its aim is not to overcome \ndifferences, but to analyse them, to say what \n \n \n((189)) \nexactly they consist of, to differentiate them. How does this differen-tiation operate? \n \n1. Instead of considering that discourse is made up of a series of homogeneous events (individual formulations), \narchaeology dis-tinguishes several possible levels of events within the very density of discourse: the level of the \nstatements themselves in their unique emergence; the level of the appearance of objects, types of enunciation, concepts, \nstrategic choices (or transformations that affect those that already exist); the level of the derivation of new rules of \nforma-tion on the basis of rules that are already in operation – but always in the element of a single positivity; lastly, a \nfourth level, at which the substitution of one discursive formation for another takes place (or the mere appearance and \ndisappearance of a positivity). These events, which are by far the most rare, are, for archaeology, the most important: \nonly archaeology, in any case, can reveal them. But they are not the exclusive object of its description; it would be a \nmistake to think that they have an absolute control over all the others, and that they lead to similar, simultaneous \nruptures at the different levels distinguished above. All the events that occur within the density of discourse are not \nimmediately below one another. Of course, the appearance of a discursive formation is often correlative with a vast \nrenewal of objects, forms of enunciation, concepts, and strategies (a principle that is not universal however: General \nGrammar was established in the seventeenth century without much apparent alteration in grammatical tradition); but it is \nnot possible to determine the particular concept or object that suddenly manifests its presence. One should not describe \nsuch an event, therefore, in accordance with categories that may be suitable for the emergence of a formulation, or the \nappearance of a new word. It is useless to ask of such an event questions like: `Who is its author? Who is speaking? In \nwhat circumstances and in what context? With what intentions, what project in mind?' The appearance of a new \npositivity is not indicated by a new sentence – unexpected, surprising, logically unpredictable, stylistically deviant – that \nis inserted into a text, and announces either the opening of a new chapter, or the entry of a new speaker.

One can find in such phenomena \ntherefore: elements that remain throughout several distinct positivities, their form and content remaining the same, but \ntheir formations being heterogeneous (such as monetary circulation as an object first in the Analysis of Wealth, and then \nin political economy; the concept of character first in Natural History, then in biology); elements that are constituted, \nmodified, organized in one discursive formation, and which, stabilized at last, figure in another (such as the concept of \nreflex, which, as \n \n \n((192)) \nG.

We must not imagine that rupture is a sort of great \ndrift that carries with it all discursive formations at once: rupture is not an undifferentiated inter-val — even a \nmomentary one — between two manifest phases; it is not a kind of lapsus without duration that separates two periods, \nand which deploys two heterogeneous stages on either side of a split; it is always a discontinuity specified by a number \nof distinct transformations, between two particular positivities. The analysis of archaeological breaks sets out, therefore, \nto establish, between so many different changes, analogies and differences, hierarchies, complementarities, coincidences, \nand shifts: in short, to describe the dispersion of the discontinuities themselves. \nThe idea of a single break suddenly, at a given moment, dividing all discursive formations, interrupting them in a \nsingle moment and reconstituting them in accordance with the same rules — such an idea cannot be sustained. The \ncontemporaneity of several transformations does not mean their exact chronological coincidence: each transformation \nmay have its own particular index of temporal `viscosity'. Natural History, General Grammar, and the Analysis of \nWealth were constituted in similar ways, and all three in the course of the seventeenth century; but the system of \nformation of the Analysis of Wealth was linked with a great many conditions and non-discursive practices (the \ncirculation of goods, monetary manipulations and their effects, the system of protect-ing trade and manufactures, \nfluctuations in the quantity of metal coined): hence the slowness of a process that lasted for over a century (from \nGrammont to Cantillon), whereas the transformations that had taken place in General Grammar and Natural History had \nextended over scarcely more than twenty-five years. Inversely, contemporary, \n((194)) \nsimilar, and linked transformations do not belong to a single model that is reproduced several times on the surface of \ndiscourses, and imposes on all a strictly identical form of rupture: when one describes the archaeological break that led to \nphilology, biology, and economics, one is showing how these three positivities were linked (by the disappearance of the \nanalysis of the sign, and of the theory of representation), what symmetrical effects it could produce (the idea of a totality \nand of an organic adaptation among living beings; the idea of morphological coherence, and of a regulated evolution in \nlanguages; the idea of a form of production that has its internal laws and its limits of development); but it also shows what \nwere the specific differences of these transformations (how in particular historicity is introduced in a particular way in \nthese three positivities, how their relation to history cannot therefore be the same, even though they all have a particular \nrelation with it). \nLastly, there are important shifts between different archaeological ruptures — and sometimes even between discursive \nformations that are very close and linked by a great many relations. Let us take the disciplines of languages and historical \nanalysis: the great transformation that gave rise at the beginning of the nineteenth century to a historical, comparative \ngrammar preceded by a good half-century the mutation in historical discourse: as a result, the system of interpositivity in \nwhich philology was involved was profoundly affected in the second half of the nineteenth century, without the positivity \nof philology ever being put into question. Hence phenomena of 'fragmented shift', of which we can cite at least another \nfamous example: concepts like those of surplus value or falling rate of profit, as found in Marx, may be described on the \nbasis of the system of positivity that is already in operation in the work of Ricardo; but these concepts (which are new, \nbut whose rules of formation are not) appear — in Marx himself — as belonging at the same time to a quite different \ndiscursive practice: they are formed in that discursive practice in accordance with specific laws, they occupy in it a \ndifferent position, they do not figure in the same sequences: this new positivity is not a transformation of Ricardo's \nanalyses; it is not a new political economy; it is a discourse that occurred around the derivation of certain economic \nconcepts, but which, in turn, defines the conditions in which the discourse of \n((195)) \neconomists takes place, and may therefore be valid as a theory and a critique of political economy. \nArchaeology disarticulates the synchrony of breaks, just as it destroyed the abstract unity of \nchange and event. The period is neither its basic unity, nor its horizon, nor its object: if it speaks of \nthese things it is always in terms of particular discursive practices, and as a result of its analyses. \nThe Classical age, which has often been mentioned in archaeological analyses, is not a temporal \nfigure that imposes its unity and empty form on all discourses; it is the name that is given to a \ntangle of continuities and discontinuities, modifications within positivities, dis-cursive formations \nthat appear and disappear. Similarly, rupture is not for archaeology the prop of its analyses, the \nlimit that it indicates from afar, without being able either to determine it or to give it specificity; \nrupture is the name given to transformations that bear on the general rules of one or several \ndiscursive formations. Thus the French Revolution — since up to now all archaeological analyses \nhave been centred on it — does not play the role of an event exterior to discourse, whose divisive \neffect one is under some kind of obligation to discover in all dis-courses; it functions as a complex, \narticulated, describable group of transformations that left a number of positivities intact, fixed for a \n",

SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE \nA silent delimitation has been imposed on all the preceding analyses, without the principle \ngoverning it, or even its outline, being made clear. All the examples referred to belonged without \nexception to a very small domain. In no way could I be said to have 'covered', let alone analysed, \nthe immense domain of discourse: why did I systematically ignore 'literary', 'philosophical', or \n'political' texts? Do not discursive formations and systems of positivities have a place in them too? \nAnd if I was restricting my attention to the sciences, why did I say nothing of mathematics, \nphysics, or chemistry? Why did I concentrate on so many dubious, still imprecise disciplines that \nare perhaps doomed for ever to remain below the threshold of scientificity? In short, what is the \nrelation between archaeology and the analysis of the sciences? \n(a) POSITIVITIES, DISCIPLINES, SCIENCES \nFirst question: does not archaeology, under the rather bizarre terms of 'discursive formation' and \n'positivity', describe what are quite simply pseudo-sciences (like psychopathology), sciences at the \nprehistoric stage (like Natural History), or sciences entirely penetrated with ideology (like political \neconomy)? Is it not the privileged analysis of what will always remain quasi-scientific? If one calls \n'disciplines' groups of \n \n \n((197)) \nstatements that borrow their organization from scientific models, which tend to coherence and demonstrativity, which are \naccepted, institutionalized, transmitted, and sometimes taught as sciences, could one not say that archaeology describes \ndisciplines that are not really sciences, while epistemology describes sciences that have been formed on the basis of (or in \nspite of) existing disciplines? \nTo these questions I can reply in the negative. Archaeology does not describe disciplines. At most, such disciplines \nmay, in their manifest deployment, serve as starting-points for the description of positivities; but they do not fix its limits: \nthey do not impose definitive divisions upon it; at the end of the analysis they do not re-emerge in the same state in which \nthey entered it; one cannot establish a bi-univocal relation between established disciplines and discursive formations. \nLet us take an example of this distortion. The linch-pin of Madness and Civilization was the appearance at the \nbeginning of the nineteenth century of a psychiatric discipline. This discipline had neither the same content, nor the same \ninternal organization, nor the same place in medicine, nor the same practical function, nor the same methods as the \ntraditional chapter on `diseases of the head' or `nervous diseases' to be found in eighteenth-century medical treatises. But \non examining this new discipline, we discovered two things: what made it possible at the time it appeared, what brought \n",

The discursive formation whose existence was mapped by \nthe psychiatric discipline was not coextensive with it, far from it: it went well beyond the boundaries of psychiatry. \nMoreover, by going back in time and trying to discover what, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, could have \npreceded the establishment of psychiatry, we realized that there was no such prior discipline: what had been said \n \n \n((198)) \non the subject of mania, delirium, melancholia, and nervous diseases by the doctors of the Classical period in no way \nconstituted. an autonomous discipline, but at most a commentary on the analysis of fevers, of alterations in the humours, \nor of affections of the brain. However, despite the absence of any established discipline, a discursive practice, with its \nown regularity and consistency, was in operation. This dis-cursive practice was certainly present in medicine, but it was \nalso to be found in administrative regulations, in literary or philosophical texts, in casuistics, in the theories or projects \nof obligatory labour or assistance to the poor. In the Classical period, therefore, there were a discursive formation and a \npositivity perfectly accessible to description, to which corresponded no definite discipline that could be compared with \npsychiatry. \nBut although it is true that positivities are not merely the doublets of established disciplines, are they not the \nprototypes of future sciences? By discursive formation, does one not mean the retrospective projection of sciences on \ntheir own past, the shadow that they cast on what preceded them and which thus appears to have foreshadowed them? \nWhat we have described, for example, as the Analysis of Wealth or General Grammar, thus according them what was \nperhaps a highly artificial autonomy, was it not, quite simply, political economy in an inchoate state, or a stage prior to \nthe establishment of a truly rigorous science of language? Is it archaeology trying, by means of a retrograde movement \nwhose legitimacy it would no doubt be difficult to establish, to regroup in an independent discursive practice all the \nheterogeneous and dispersed elements whose complicity will prove to he necessary to the establishment of a science? \nAgain, the answer must be in the negative. What was analysed under the name of Natural History does not embrace, \nin a single figure, everything that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries might validly constitute a prototype of the \nscience of life, and figure in its legitimate genealogy. The positivity thus revealed accounts for a num-ber of statements \nconcerning the resemblances and differences between beings, their visible structure, their specific and generic char-\nacters, their possible classification, the discontinuities that separate them, and the transitions that connect them; but it \nignores a number of other analyses that date nevertheless from the same period, and which \n \n \n((199)) \nalso outline the ancestral figures of biology: the analysis of reflex movement (which was to have so much importance in \nthe constitution of an anatomo-physiology of the nervous system), the theory of germs (which seems to anticipate the \nproblems of evolution and genetics), the explanation of animal or vegetal growth (which was to be one of the major \nquestions of the physiology of organisms in general). More-over: far from anticipating a future biology, Natural History \n— a taxonomic discourse, linked to the theory of signs and to the project of a science of order — excluded, by its solidity \nand autonomy, the constitution of a unitary science of life. Similarly, the discursive formation described as General \nGrammar does not take into account — far from it — everything that could have been said about language in the \nClassical period, and of which the inheritance or repudiation, development or critique, was to be found later in philology: \nit ignored the methods of Biblical exegesis, and that philosophy of language as formulated by Vico or Herder. Discursive \nformations are not, therefore, future sciences at the stage at which, still unconscious of themselves, they are quietly being \nconstituted: they are not, in fact, in a state of teleological subordination in relation to the orthogenesis of the sciences. \nShould it be said, therefore, that there can he no science where there is a positivity, and that positivities are always \nexclusive of the sciences? Should it be supposed that instead of being in a chronological relation to the sciences, they are \nin fact alternatives? That they are, in a way, the positive figure of a certain epistemological defect. But here, too, one \ncould find a counter-example. Clinical medicine is certainly not a science. Not only because it does not comply with the \nformal criteria, or attain the level of rigour expected of physics, chemistry, or even of physiology; but also because it \ninvolves a scarcely organized mass of empirical. observations, uncontrolled experiments and results, therapeutic \nprescriptions, and institutional regulations. And yet this non-science is not exclusive of science: in the course of the \nnineteenth century, it established definite relations between such perfectly constituted sciences as physiology, chemistry, \nor microbiology; moreover, it gave rise to such discourses as that of morbid anatomy, which it would be presumptuous no \ndoubt to call a false science. \n",

What, therefore, is the relation \nbetween the positivities and the sciences? \n(b) KNOWLEDGE (SAVOIR) \nPositivities do not characterize forms of knowledge — whether they are a priori, necessary conditions or forms of \nrationality that have, in turn, been put into operation by history. But neither do they define the state of knowledge at a \ngiven moment in time: they do not draw up a list of what, from that moment, had been demonstrated to be true and had \nassumed the status of definitively acquired knowledge, and a list of what, on the other hand, had been accepted without \neither proof or adequate demonstration, or of what had been accepted as a common belief or a belief demanded by the \npower of the imagination. To analyse positivities is to show in accordance with which rules a discursive practice may \nform groups of objects, enunciations, concepts, or theoretical choices. The elements thus formed do not constitute a \nscience, with a defined structure of ideality; their system of relations is certainly less strict; but neither are they items of \nknowledge piled up one on top of another, derived from heterogeneous experiments, traditions, or discoveries, and linked \nonly by the identity of the subject that possesses them. They are that on the basis of which coherent (or incoherent) \npropositions are built up, more or less exact descriptions developed, verifications carried out, theories deployed. They \nform the precondition of what is later revealed and which later functions as an item of knowledge or an illusion, an \naccepted truth or an exposed error, a definitive acquisition or an obstacle surmounted. This precondition may not, of \ncourse, be analysed as a donee, a lived experience, still implicated in the imagination or in perception, which manking in \nthe course of its history took up again in the form of rationality, or which each individual must undergo on his own \naccount if he wishes to rediscover the ideal meanings that are contained or concealed within it. It is not a pre-knowledge \nor an archaic stage in the movement that leads from immediate knowledge to apodicticity; it is a group of elements that \nwould have to be formed by a discursive practice if a scientific discourse was to be constituted, specified not only by its \nform and \n((201)) \nrigour, but also by the objects with which it deals, the types of enunciation that it uses, the concepts that it manipulates, \nand the strategies that it employs. Thus science is not linked with that which must have been lived, or must be lived, if the \nintention of ideality proper to it is to he established; but with that which must have been said — or must be said — if a \ndiscourse is to exist that complies, if necessary, with the experimental or formal criteria of scientificity. \nThis group of elements, formed in a regular manner by a discursive practice; and which are indispensable to the \nconstitution of a science, although they are not necessarily destined to give rise to one, can he called knowledge. \nKnowledge is that of which one can speak in a dis-cursive practice, and which is specified by that fact: the domain consti-\ntuted by the different objects that will or will not acquire a scientific status (the knowledge of psychiatry in the nineteenth \ncentury is not the sum of what was thought to he true, but the whole set of practices, singularities, and deviations of \nwhich one could speak in psychiatric discourse); knowledge is also the space in which the subject may take up a position \nand speak of the objects with which he deals in his discourse (in this sense, the knowledge of clinical medicine is the \nwhole group of functions of observation, interrogation, decipherment, recording, and decision that may be exercised by \nthe subject of medical discourse); knowledge is also the field of coordination and subordination of statements in which \nconcepts appear, and are defined, applied and transformed (at this level, the knowledge of Natural History, in the \neighteenth century, is not the sum of what was said, but the whole set of modes and sites in accordance with which one \ncan integrate each new statement with the already said); lastly, knowledge is defined by the possibilities of use and \nappropriation offered by discourse (thus, the knowledge of political economy, in the Classical period, is not the thesis of \nthe different theses sustained, but the totality of its points of articulation on other discourses or on other practices that are \nnot dis-cursive). There are bodies of knowledge that are independent of the sciences (which are neither their historical \nprototypes, nor their practical by-products), but there is no knowledge without a particular discursive practice; and any \ndiscursive practice may he defined by the knowledge that it forms. \nInstead of exploring the consciousness/knowledge (connaissance) / \n((202)) \nscience axis (which cannot escape subjectivity), archaeology explores the discursive practice/knowledge (savoir)/science \naxis.' And whereas the history of ideas finds the point of balance of its analysis in the element of connaissance (and is \nthus forced, against its will, to encounter the transcendental interrogation), archaeology finds the point of balance of its \nanalysis in savoir — that is., in a domain in which the subject is necessarily situated and dependent, and can never figure as \ntitular (either as a transcendental activity, or as empirical consciousness). \nIt is understandable in these conditions that we should distinguish carefully between scientific domains and \narchaeological territories: their articulation and their principles of organization are quite different.

Archaeological \nterritories may extend to 'literary' or 'philosophical' texts, as well as scientific ones. Knowledge is to be found not only in \ndemonstrations, it can also he found in fiction, reflexion, narrative accounts, institutional regulations, and political \ndecisions. The archaeological territory of Natural History includes Bonnet's Palingenesie philosophique or Benoit de \nMaillet's Telliamed, although they do not comply to a great extent with the accepted scientific norms of the period, and \neven less, of course, with those that came to be required later. The archaeological territory of General Grammar embraces \nthe imaginings of Fabre d'Olivet (which were never accorded scientific status, and belong rather to the sphere of mystical \nthought) no less than the analysis of attributive propositions (which was then accepted as evident truth, and in which \ngenerative grammar may now recognize its prefigured truth). \n \n((footnote)) \n \n \n' For the distinction between connaissance and savoir, cf. note 3, p. 16. \n((203)) \nDiscursive practice does not coincide with the scientific develop-ment that it may give rise to; and the knowledge that \nit forms is neither an unfinished prototype nor the by-product to be found in daily life of a constituted science. The \nsciences — ignoring, for the moment, the difference between discourses that have the status of scientificity, or \npretensions to it, and those that really present the formal criteria of a science — appear in the element of a discursive \nformation and against the background of knowledge. This opens up two series of problems: what can be the place or role \nof a region of scientificity in the archaeological territory in which it appears? In accordance with what order and what \nprocesses is the emergence of a region of scientificity in a given discursive formation accompished? We cannot, at \npresent, pro-vide solutions to these problems: all we can do now is to indicate in what direction they might be analysed. \n(c) KNOWLEDGE (SAVOIR) AND IDEOLOGY \nOnce constituted, a science does not take up, with all the interconnexions that are proper to it, everything that formed the \ndiscursive practice in which it appeared; nor does it dissipate — in order to condemn it to the prehistory of error, \nprejudice, or imagination — the knowledge that surrounds it. Morbid anatomy did not reduce to the norms of scientificity \nthe positivity of clinical medicine. Knowledge is not an epistemological site that disappears in the science that supersedes \nit. Science (or what is offered as such) is localized in a field of knowledge and plays a role in it. A role that varies \naccording to different discursive formations, and is modified with their mutations. What, in the Classical period, was \noffered as the medical knowledge of dis-eases of the mind occupied a very small place in the knowledge of madness: it \nconstituted scarcely more than one of its many surfaces of contact (the others being jurisprudence, casuistics, police \nregulations, etc.); on the other hand, the psychopathological analyses of the nineteenth century, which were also offered \nas scientific knowledge (connaissance) of mental diseases, played a very different, much more important role in the \nknowledge (savoir) of madness (the role of model, and decision-making authority). Similarly, scientific discourse (or \nscientific pretension) does not perform the same function in the \n \n \n((204)) \neconomic knowledge of the seventeenth and in that of the nineteenth century. In any discursive formation, one finds a \nspecific relation between science and knowledge; and instead of defining between them a relation of exclusion or \nsubtraction (by trying to discover what in knowledge still eludes and resists science, what in science is still compromised \nby its proximity to and the influence of knowledge), archaeological analysis must show positively how a science \nfunctions in the element of knowledge. \nIt is probably there, in that space of interplay, that the relations of ideology to the sciences are established. The hold \nof ideology over scientific discourse and the ideological functioning of the sciences are not articulated at the level of \ntheir ideal structure (even if they can be expressed in it in a more or less visible way), nor at the level of their technical \nuse in a society (although that society may obtain results from it), nor at the level of the consciousness of the subjects \n",

Few discourses have given so much place to ideology as clinical discourse \nor that of political economy: this is not a sufficiently good reason to treat the totality of their statements as being \nundermined by error, contradiction, and a lack of objectivity. \n2.Theoretical contradictions, lacunae, defects may indicate the ideological functioning of a science (or of a \ndiscourse with scientific pretensions); they may enable us to determine at what point in the structure this functioning \ntakes effect. But the analysis of this function-ing must be made at the level of the positivity and of the relations \nbetween the rules of formation and the structures of scientificity. \n3.By correcting itself, by rectifying its errors, by clarifying its formulations, discourse does not necessarily undo \nits relations with ideology. The role of ideology does not diminish as rigour increases and error is dissipated. \n4.To tackle the ideological functioning of a science in order to reveal and to modify it is not to uncover the \nphilosophical presuppositions that may lie within it; nor is it to return to the foundations that made it possible, and \nthat legitimated it: it is to question it as a dis-cursive formation; it is to tackle not the formal contradictions of its \npropositions, but the system of formation of its objects, its types of enunciation, its concepts, its theoretical choices. It \nis to treat it as one practice among others. \n(d) DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS AND THEIR CHRONOLOGY \nIt is possible to describe several distinct emergences of a discursive formation. The moment at which a discursive \npractice achieves individuality and autonomy, the moment therefore at which a single \n \n \n((206)) \nsystem for the formation of statements is put into operation, or the moment at which this system is transformed, might be \ncalled the threshold of positivity. When in the operation of a discursive formation, a group of statements is articulated, \nclaims to validate (even unsuccessfully) norms of verification and coherence, and when it exercises a dominant function \n(as a model, a critique, or a verification) over knowledge, we will say that the discursive formation crosses a threshold of \nepistemologization. When the epistemological figure thus outlined obeys a number of formal criteria, when its statements \ncomply not only with archaeological rules of formation, but also with certain laws for the construction of propositions, we \nwill say that it has crossed a threshold of scientificity. And when this scientific discourse is able, in turn, to define the \naxioms necessary to it, the elements that it uses, the propositional structures that are legitimate to it, and the \ntransformations that it accepts, when it is thus able, taking itself as a starting-point, to deploy the formal edifice that it \nconstitutes, we will say that it has crossed the threshold of formalization. \nThe distribution in time of these different thresholds, their succession, their possible coincidence (or lack of it), the \nway in which they may govern one another, or become implicated with one another, the conditions in which, in turn, they \nare established, constitute for archaeology one of its major domains of exploration. Their chronology, in fact, is neither \nregular nor homogeneous. The discursive formations do not cross them at regular intervals, or at the same time, thus \ndividing up the history of human knowledge (connaissances) into different ages; at a time when many positivities have \n",

Moreover: each discursive formation does not pass through these different thresholds in turn, as \nthrough the natural stages of biological maturation, in which the only variable is the latency period or the length of the \nintervals. They are, in fact, events whose dispersion is not evolutive: their unique order is one of the characteristics of \neach discursive formation. Here are a few examples of these differences. \nIn some cases, the threshold of positivity is crossed well before that of epistemologization: thus psychopathology, as a \ndiscourse with scientific pretensions, epistemologized at the beginning of the nineteenth \n \n \n((207)) \ncentury, with Pinel, Heinroth, and Esquirol, a discursive practice that largely antedated it, and that had acquired its \nautonomy and system of regularity long before. But there are also cases in which these two stages are confused in time, \nwhen the establishment of a positivity involves at the same time the emergence of an epistemological figure. Sometimes \nthe thresholds of scientificity are linked with the transition from one positivity to another; sometimes they are different; \nthus the transition from Natural History (with the scientificity that was proper to it) to biology (as a science not of the \nclassification of beings, but of specific correlations of different organisms) did not take place at the time of Cuvier \nwithout the transformation of one positivity into another: on the other hand, the experimental medicine of Claude \nBernard, then the microbiology of Pasteur, modified the type of scientificity required by morbid anatomy and \nphysiology, without the dis-cursive formation of clinical medicine, as then established, being made inoperable. \nSimilarly, the new scientificity established in the biological disciplines by evolutionism did not modify the biological \npositivity that had been defined at the time of Cuvier. In the case of economics the disconnexions are particularly \nnumerous. In the seventeenth century, one can recognize a threshold of positivity: it almost coincides with the practice \nand theory of mercantilism; but its epistemologization did not occur until later, at the very end of the century, or the \nbeginning of the next century, with Locke and Cantillon. However, the nineteenth century, with Ricardo, marks both a \nnew type of positivity, a new form of epistemologization, which were later to he modified in turn by Cournot and \nJevons, at the very time that Marx was to reveal an entirely new discursive practice on the basis of political economy. \nIf one recognizes in science only the linear accumulation of truths or the orthogenesis of reason, and fails to recognize \nin it a discursive practice that has its own levels, its own thresholds, its own various ruptures, one can describe only a \nsingle historical division, which one adopts as a model to be applied at all times and for all forms of knowledge: a \ndivision between what is definitively or what is not yet scientific. All the density of the disconnexions, the dispersion of \nthe ruptures, the shifts in their effects, the play of the interdependence are reduced to the monotonous act of an endlessly \nrepeated foundation. \n \n \n((208)) \nThere is perhaps only one science for which one can neither distinguish these different thresholds, nor describe a \nsimilar set of shifts: mathematics, the only discursive practice to have crossed at one and the same time the thresholds of \npositivity, epistemologization, scientificity, and formalization. The very possibility of its existence implied that which, in \nall other sciences, remains dispersed throughout history, should be given at the outset: its original positivity was to \nconstitute an already formalized discursive practice (even if other formalizations were to be used later). Hence the fact \nthat their establishment is both so enigmatic (so little accessible to analysis, so confined within the form of the absolute \nbeginning) and so valid (since it is valid both as an origin and as a foundation); hence the fact that in the first gesture of \nthe first mathematician one saw the constitution of an ideality that has been deployed throughout history, and has been \nquestioned only to be repeated and purified; hence the fact that the beginning of mathematics is questioned not so much \nas a historical event as for its validity as a principal of history: and hence the fact that, for all the other sciences the \ndescription of its historical genesis, its gropings and failures, its late emergence is related to the meta-historical model of \na geometry emerging suddenly, once and for all, from the trivial practices of land-measuring. But if one takes the \nestablishment of mathematical discourse as a prototype for the birth and development of all the other sciences, one runs \nthe risk of homogenizing all the unique forms of historicity, of reducing to the authority of a single rupture all the \ndifferent thresholds that a discursive practice may cross, and reproduce endlessly, at every moment in time, the problem \nof origin: the rights of the historicotranscendental analysis would thus be reinstated. Mathematics has certainly served as \na model for most scientific discourses in their efforts to attain formal rigour and demonstrativity; but for the historian \nwho questions the actual development of the sciences, it is a bad example, an example at least from which one cannot \ngeneralize. \n(e) THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THE HISTORY OF THE SCIENCES \nThe multiple thresholds that we have succeeded in mapping make \n",

First, analysis at the level \n \n \n((209)) \nof formalization: it is this history that mathematics never ceases to recount about itself in the process of its own \ndevelopment. What it possesses at a given moment (its domain, its methods, the objects that it defines, the language that it \nemploys) is never thrown back into the external field of non-scientificity, but is constantly undergoing redefinition (if \nonly as an area that has fallen into disuse or temporary sterility) in the formal structure that mathematics constitutes; this \npast is revealed as a particular case, a naive model, a partial and insufficiently generalized sketch, of a more abstract, or \nmore powerful theory, or one existing at a higher level; mathematics retranscribes its real historical trajectory into the \nvocabulary of vicinities, dependences, subordinations, progressive formalizations, and self-enveloping generalities. For \nthis history of mathematics (the history that is constituted by mathematics itself and which mathematics recounts about \nitself), the algebra of Diophantus is not an experience that remains in sus-pense; it is a particular case of Algebra as we \nhave known it since Abel and Galois; the Greek method of exhaustions was not an impasse that had to be escaped from; it \nis a naive model of integral calculus. Each historical event has its own formal level and localization. This is a recurrential \nanalysis, which can be carried out only within a constituted science, one that has crossed its threshold of formalization.' \nThe second type of historical analysis is situated at the threshold of scientificity, and questions itself as to the way in \nwhich it was crossed on the basis of various epistemological figures. Its purpose is to dis-cover, for example, how a \nconcept — still overlaid with metaphors or imaginary contents — was purified, and accorded the status and function of a \nscientific concept. To discover how a region of experience that has already been mapped, already partially articulated, but \nis still over-laid with immediate practical uses or values related to those uses, was constituted as a scientific domain. To \ndiscover how, in general, a science was established over and against a pre-scientific level, which both paved the way and \nresisted it in advance, how it succeeded in overcoming the obstacles and limitations that still stood in its way. G. \nBachelard and G. Canguilhem have provided models of this kind of history. Unlike recurrential analysis, it has no need to \nsituate itself within the \n \n((footnote)) \n \n \nMichel Serres, Hermes ou la communication, p. 78. \n((210)) \n \n \nscience itself, to redistribute every episode in its construction, to recount its formalization in the formal vocabulary that it \nstill possesses today: indeed, how could it do so, since it shows what the science has freed itself from, everything that it \nhas had to leave behind in its pro-gress towards the threshold of scientificity. Consequently, this description takes as its \nnorm the fully constituted science; the history that it recounts is necessarily concerned with the opposition of truth and \nerror, the rational and the irrational, the obstacle and fecundity, purity and impurity, the scientific and the non-scientific. \nIt is an epistemological history of the sciences. \nThe third type of historical analysis takes as its point of attack the threshold of epistemologization — the point of \ncleavage between dis-cursive formations defined by their positivity and epistemological figures that are not necessarily \nall sciences (and which may never, in fact, succeed in becoming sciences). At this level, scientificity does not serve as a \nnorm: in this archaeological history, what one is trying to uncover are discursive practices in so far as they give rise to a \ncorpus of knowledge, in so far as they assume the status and role of a science. To undertake a history of the sciences at \nthis level is not to describe discursive formations without regard to epistemological structures; it is to show how the \nestablishment of a science, and perhaps its transition to formalization, have come about in a discursive formation, and in \nmodifications to its positivity. Such an analysis sets out, therefore, to outline the history of the sciences on the basis of a \ndescription of discursive practices; to define how, in accordance with which regularity, and as a result of which \nmodification, it was able to give rise to the processes of epistemologization, to attain the norms of scientificity, and, \nperhaps, to reach the threshold of formalization. In seeking the level of discursive practice in the historical density of the \nsciences, one is not trying to place the discursive practice at some deep, original level, one is not trying to place it at the \nlevel of lived experience (on this earth, which is given, irregular and fragmented, before all geometry; in the heaven that \nglitters through the grid of all astronomies) ; one is trying to reveal between positivities, knowledge, epistemological \nfigures, and sciences, a whole set of differences, relations, gaps, shifts, independences, autonomies, and the way in which \nthey articulate their own historicities on one another. \n \n \n((211)) \nThe analysis of discursive formations, of positivities, and knowledge in their relations with epistemological figures \nand with the sciences is what has been called, to distinguish it from other possible forms of the history of the sciences, \nthe analysis of the episteme.

By episteme, we mean, in fact, the total set of relations that unite, at a \ngiven period, the discursive practices that give rise to epistemological figures, sciences, and possibly formalized \nsystems; the way in which, in each of these discursive formations, the transitions to epistemologization, scientificity, and \nformalization are situated and operate; the distribution of these thresholds, which may coincide, be subordinated to one \nanother, or be separated by shifts in time; the lateral relations that may exist between epistemological figures or sciences \nin so far as they belong to neighbouring, but distinct, discursive practices. The episteme is not a form of knowledge \n(connaissance) or type of rationality which, crossing the boundaries of the most varied sciences, manifests the sovereign \nunity of a subject, a spirit, or a period; it is the totality of relations that can be discovered, for a given period, between the \nsciences when one analyses them at the level of discursive regularities. \nThe description of the episteme presents several essential. characteristics therefore: it opens up an inexhaustible field \nand can never be closed; its aim is not to reconstitute the system of postulates that gov-erns all the branches of \nknowledge (connaissances) of a given period, but to cover an indefinite field of relations. Moreover, the episteme is not \na motionless figure that appeared one day with the mission of effacing all that preceded it: it is a constantly moving set \nof articulations, shifts, and coincidences that are established, only to give rise to others. As a set of relations between \nsciences, epistemological figures, positivities, and discursive practices, the episteme makes it possible to grasp the set of \nconstraints and limitations which, at a given moment, are imposed on discourse: but this limitation is not the negative \nlimitation that opposes knowledge (connaissance) to ignorance, reasoning to imagination, armed experience to fidelity to \nappearances, and fantasy to inferences and \n \n \n((212)) \ndeductions; the episteme is not what may be known at a given period, due account taken of inadequate techniques, mental \nattitudes, or the limitations imposed by tradition; it is what, in the positivity of discursive practices, makes possible the \nexistence of epistemological figures and sciences. Lastly, we see that the analysis of the episteme is not a way of \nreturning to the critical question ('given the existence of something like a science, what is its legitimacy?'); it is a \nquestioning that accepts the fact of science only in order to ask the question what it is for that science to be a science. In \nthe enigma of scientific discourse, what the analysis of the episteme questions is not its right to be a science, but the fact \nthat it exists. And the point at which it separates itself off from all the philosophies of knowledge (connaissance) is that it \nrelates this fact not to the authority of an original act of giving, which establishes in a transcendental subject the fact and \nthe right, but to the processes of a historical practice. \n(f) OTHER ARCHAEOLOG I ES \nOne question remains in suspense: could one conceive of an archaeological analysis that would reveal the regularity of a \nbody of knowledge, but which would not set out to analyse it in terms of epistemological figures and sciences? Is an \norientation towards the episteme the only one open to archaeology? Must archaeology be — exclusively — a certain way \nof questioning the history of the sciences? In other words, by confirming itself up to now to the region of scientific \ndiscourses, has archaeology been governed by some insuperable necessity — or has it provided an outline, on the basis of \na particular example, of forms of analysis that may have a much wider application? \nAt the moment I am not sufficiently advanced in my task to answer this question. But I can readily imagine — subject \nto a great deal of further exploration and examination — archaeologies that might develop in different directions. There \nis, for example, the archaeological description of 'sexuality'. And I can see very well how it might be orientated towards \nthe episteme: one would show how in the nineteenth century such epistemological figures as the biology and psychology \nof sexuality were formed; and how a discourse of a scientific type was established through the rupture brought about by \nFreud.

    "chunk_full": "can also see another possible direction for analysis: instead of studying the sexual behaviour of men at a given period \n(by seeking its law in a social structure, in a collective unconscious, or in a certain moral attitude), instead of describing \nwhat men thought of sexuality (what religious interpretation they gave it, to what extent they approved or disapproved of \nit, what conflicts of opinion or morality it gave rise to), one would ask oneself whether, in this behaviour, as in these \nrepresentations, a whole discursive practice is not at work; whether sexuality, quite apart from any orientation towards a \nscientific discourse, is not a group of objects that can be talked about (or that it is forbidden to talk about), a field of \npossible enunciations (whether in lyrical or legal language), a group of concepts (which can no doubt be presented in the \nelementary form of notions or themes), a set of choices (which may appear in the coherence of behavior or in systems of \nprescription). • Such an archaeology would show, if it succeeded in its task, how the prohibitions, exclusions, limitations, \nvalues, freedoms, and transgressions of sexuality, all its manifestations, verbal or otherwise, are linked to a particular \ndiscursive practice. It would reveal, not of course as the ultimate truth of sexuality, but as one of the dimensions in \naccordance with which one can describe it, a certain 'way of speaking'; and one would show how this way of speaking is \ninvested not in scientific discourses, but in a system of prohibitions and values. An analysis that would be carried out not \nin the direction of the episteme, but in that of what we might call the ethical. \nBut here is an example of another possible orientation. In analysing a painting, one can reconstitute the latent discourse \nof the painter; one can try to recapture the murmur of his intentions, which are not tran-scribed into words, but into lines, \nsurfaces, and colours; one can try to uncover the implicit philosophy that is supposed to form his view of the world. It is \nalso possible to question science, or at least the opinions of the period, and to try to recognize to what extent they appear \nin the painter's work. Archaeological analysis would have another aim: it would try to discover whether space, distance, \ndepth, colour, light, proportions, volumes, and contours were not, at the period in question, considered, named, \nenunciated, and conceptualized in a discursive practice; and whether the knowledge that this discursive practice gives rise \nto was not embodied perhaps in theories and \n \n \n((214)) \nspeculations, in forms of teaching and codes of practice, but also in processes, techniques, and even in the very gesture of \nthe painter. It would not set out to show that the painting is a certain way of 'mean-ing' or 'saying' that is peculiar in that it \ndispenses with words. It would try to show that, at least in one of its dimensions, it is discursive practice that is embodied \nin techniques and effects. In this sense, the painting is not a pure vision that must then he transcribed into the materiality \nof space; nor is it a naked gesture whose silent and eternally empty meanings must be freed from subsequent \ninterpretations. It is shot through — and independently of scientific knowledge (connaissance) and philosophical themes \n— with the positivity of a knowledge (savoir). \nIt seems to me that one might also carry out an analysis of the same type on political knowledge. One would try to \nshow whether the political behavior of a society, a group, or a class is not shot through with a particular, describable \ndiscursive practice. This positivity would obviously not coincide either with the political theories of the period or with \neconomic determinations: it would define the element in politics that can become an object of enunciation, the forms that \nthis enunciation may take, the concepts that are employed in it, and the strategic choices that are made in it. Instead of \nanalysing this knowledge — which is always possible — in the direction of the episteme that it can give rise to, one \nwould analyse it in the direction of behaviour, struggles, conflicts, decisions, and tactics. One would thus reveal a body of \npolitical knowledge that is not some kind of secondary theorizing about practice, nor the application of theory. Since it is \nregularly formed by a discursive practice that is deployed among other practices and is articulated upon them, it is not an \nexpression that more or less adequately 'reflects' a number of 'objective data' or real practices. It is inscribed, from the \noutset, in the field of different practices in which it finds its specificity, its functions, and its network of dependences. If \nsuch a description were possible, there would be no need of course to pass through the authority of an individual or \ncollective consciousness in order to grasp the place of articulation of a political practice and theory; there would he no \nneed to try to discover to what extent this consciousness may, on the one hand, express silent conditions, and, on the \nother, show that it is susceptible to theoretical truths; one would not need to pose the psychological problem of an act of \nconsciousness \n \n((215)) \n(prise de conscience); instead, one would analyse the formation and trans-formations of a body of \nknowledge. The question, for example, would not be to determine from what moment a \nrevolutionary consciousness appears, nor the respective roles of economic conditions and theor-\netical elucidations in the genesis of this consciousness; it would not attempt to retrace the general, \nand exemplary, biography of revolutionary man, or to find the origins of his project; but it would \ntry to explain the formation of a discursive practice and a body of revolutionary knowledge that \nare expressed in behaviour and strategies, which give rise to a theory of society, and which \n",

Is it always an \nanalysis of scientific discourse? — we can now give a reply, in each case in the negative. What \narchaeology tries to describe is not the specific structure of science, but the very different domain \nof knowledge. Moreover, although it is concerned with know-ledge in its relation to \nepistemological figures and the sciences, it may also question knowledge in a different direction \nand describe it in a different set of relations. The orientation towards the episteme has been the \nonly one to be explored so far. The reason for this is that, because of a gradient that no doubt \ncharacterizes our cultures, dis-cursive formations are constantly becoming epistemologized. It is \nby questioning the sciences, their history, their strange unity, their dispersion, and their ruptures, \nthat the domain of positivities was able to appear; it is in the interstice of scientific discourses that \nwe were able to grasp the play of discursive formations. It is hardly surprising, there-fore, that the \nmost fruitful region, the one most open to archaeological description should have been that \n'Classical' age, which from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century saw the epistemologization \nof so many positivities; nor is it surprising that the discursive formations and specific regularities \nof knowledge are outlined precisely where the levels of scientificity and formalization were most \ndifficult to attain. But that was no more than a preferential point of attack; it is not, for \narchaeology, an obligatory domain. \n \n \n((219)) \n \n \nPart V Conclusion \nCONCLUSION \n—Throughout this book, you have been at great pains to dissociate yourself from `structuralism', or at least from what is \nordinarily under-stood by that term. You have tried to show that you used neither the methods nor the concepts of \nstructuralism; that you make no reference to the procedures of linguistic description; that you are not concerned with \nformalization. But what do these differences amount to, if not that you have failed to avail yourself of what is most \npositive, most rigorous, and most revealing in structural analysis? That the domain that you have tried to deal with is not \nsusceptible to this kind of enterprise, and that its richness has constantly eluded the schemata in which you wished to \nenclose it? And with apparent unconcern, you are now trying to disguise the impotence of your method; you are now \npresent-ing as an explicitly intended difference the unconquerable distance that separates you, and will always separate \nyou, from a true structural analysis. \nFor you have not managed to deceive us. It is true that in the void left by the methods that you have chosen not to use, \nyou have precipitated a whole series of notions that seem quite alien to the concepts now accepted by those who describe \nlanguages, myths, or works of literature; you have spoken of formations, positivities, knowledge, discursive practices: a \nwhole panoply of terms whose uniqueness and \n \n \n((220)) \nmarvellous powers you were proud to point out at every step. But would you have invented so many oddities if you had \nnot tried to apply, in a domain that was irreducible to them, some of the fundamental themes of structuralism — and those \nvery themes that constitute its most debatable and philosophically dubious postulates? It is as if you had used not the \nempirical, serious work of structural analysis, but two or three themes that are really extrapolations rather than necessary \nprinciples. \nYou have tried to reduce the dimensions proper to discourse, ignore its specific irregularity, hide what initiative and \nfreedom it possesses, and make up for the imbalance that it sets up within the language (longue): you have tried to close \nthis openness. Like a certain form of linguistics, you have tried to dispense with the speaking subject; you believed that \none could cut off from discourse all its anthropological references, and treat it as if it had never been formulated by \nanyone, as if it had not come about in particular circumstances, as if it were not imbued with representations, as if it were \n",

Lastly, you have applied to it a principle of simultaneity: you have refused to see that discourse, \nunlike the language (longue) perhaps, is essentially historical, that it was made up not of available elements, but of real, \nsuccessive events, that it cannot be analysed outside the time in which it occurred. \n \n—You are quite right: I misunderstood the transcendence of dis-course; in describing it, I refused to refer it to a \nsubjectivity; I did not give primary consideration, as if it ought to be its general form, to its diachronic character. But this \nwas not intended to extend, beyond the domain of the language (longue), concepts and methods that had been tested \nwithin it. If I spoke of discourse, it was not to show that the mechanisms or processes of the language (longue) were \nentirely pre-served in it; but rather to reveal, in the density of verbal performances, the diversity of the possible levels of \nanalysis; to show that in addition to methods of linguistic structuration (or interpretation), one could draw up a specific \ndescription of statements, of their formation, and of the regularities proper to discourse. If I suspended all reference to the \nspeaking subject, it was not to discover laws of construction or forms that could be applied in the same way by all \nspeaking subjects, nor was \n \n \n((221)) \nit to give voice to the great universal discourse that is common to all men at a particular period. On the contrary, my aim \nwas to show what the differences consisted of, how it was possible for men, within the same discursive practice, to speak \nof different objects, to have contrary opinions, and to make contradictory choices; my aim was also to show in what way \ndiscursive practices were distinguished from one another; in short, I wanted not to exclude the problem of the subject, \nbut to define the positions and functions that the subject could occupy in the diversity of discourse. Lastly, as you have \nobserved, I did not deny history, but held in suspense the general, empty category of change in order to reveal \ntransformations at different levels; I reject a uniform model of temporalization, in order to describe, for each discursive \npractice, its rules of accumulation, exclusion, reactivation, its own forms of derivation, and its specific modes of \nconnexion over various successions. \nSo I did not wish to carry the structuralist enterprise beyond its legitimate limits. And you must admit that I never \nonce used the word `structure' in The Order of Things. But let us leave off our polemics about `structuralism'; they \nhardly survive in areas now deserted by serious workers; this particular controversy, which might have been so fruiftul, \nis now acted out only by mimes and tumblers. \n \n—It's no use trying to avoid these polemics: you won't escape the problem so easily. For the problem does not \nconcern structuralism. I recognize the value of its insights of course: when it is a question of analysing a language \n(longue), mythologies, folk-tales, poems, dreams, works of literature, even films perhaps, structural description reveals \nrelations that could not otherwise be isolated; it makes it possible to define recurrent elements, with their forms of \nopposition, and their criteria of individualization; it also makes it possible to lay down laws of construction, \nequivalences, and rules of transformation. And despite a number of reservations that I had at the beginning, I now have \nno difficulty in accepting that man's languages (longues), his unconscious, and his imagination are governed by laws of \nstructure. But what I absolutely cannot accept is what you are doing: I cannot accept that one can analyse scientific \ndiscourses in their succession without referring them to something like a constituent activity, without recognizing \n \n \n((222)) \neven in their hesitations the opening of an original project or a fundamental teleology, without discovering the profound \ncontinuity that links them, and leads them to the point at which we can grasp them; I cannot accept that one can analyse \nthe development of reason in this way, and free the history of thought from all taint of subjectivity. Let us examine the \nproblem more closely: I agree that one can speak, in terms of elements and rules of construction, of language (longue) in \ngeneral — at least of that language of other times and places which is that of myths, or even of that nevertheless rather \nstrange language which is that of our unconscious or of our literary works; but the language of our knowledge, that \nlanguage which we are using here and now, the structural discourse itself that enables us to analyse so many other \nlanguages (langages), that language which, in its historical density, we regard as irreducible. You surely cannot forget \nthat it is on the basis of that language, with its slow genesis, and the obscure development that has brought it to its present \nstate, that we can speak of other discourses in terms of structures; it is that language which has given us the possibility \nand the right to do so; it forms the blind spot on the basis of which things around us are arranged as we see them today. I \ndon't mind one dealing with elements, relations, and discontinuities when analysing Indo-European myths or the tragedies \nof Racine; and I can even accept that one should dispense, as far as one can, with a discussion of the speaking subjects; \nbut I dispute that these successes give one the right to turn the analysis back on to the forms of discourse that made them \n",

The history of those analyses in which \nsubjectivity eludes one retains its own transcendence. \n \n—It seems to me that the difference between us lies there (much more than in the over-discussed question of \nstructuralism). As you know, I have no great liking for interpretation, but allow me, as a kind of game, to say what I \nunderstand you to have said earlier. 'Of course', you say, 'we must now admit, despite all the attacks of the arriere-garde, \nthat one formalizes deductive discourses; of course we have to admit that one describes, not so much the history of a soul, \nnot so much a project of existence, as the architecture of a philosophical system; of course, whatever we think about it, \nwe have to tolerate those analyses \n \n((223)) \nthat link literary oeuvres, not to the lived experience of an individual, but to the structures of the language (longue). Of \ncourse, we have had to abandon all those discourses that once led us to the sovereignty of consciousness. But what we \nhave lost over the last half-century, we are hoping to recover in the second degree, by means of the analysis of those \nanalyses, or at least by the fundamental questioning that we apply to them. We will ask them where they came from, \ntowards what historical destination they are moving without being aware of it, what naivety blinds them to the conditions \nthat make them possible, and what metaphysical enclosure encloses their rudimentary positivism. And so in the end it will \nnot matter that the unconscious is not, as we believed and affirmed, the implicit edge of consciousness; it will not matter \nthat a mythology is no longer a world-view, and that a novel is something other than the outer slope of a lived experience; \nfor the reason that establishes all these new 'truths' is under strict supervision: neither itself, nor its past, nor that which \nmakes it possible, nor that which makes it ours escapes the attribution of transcendence. For it is to it now — and we are \ndetermined never to abandon this — that we will now pose the question of the origin, the first constitution, the teleo-\nlogical horizon, temporal continuity. It is that thought, which is now becoming ours, that we will maintain in historico-\ntranscendental dominance. That is why, if we must tolerate all these structuralisms, whether we like it or not, we will not \nallow any taint to that history of thought that is our own history; we will not allow the unravelling of those transcendental \nthreads that have hound it since the nineteenth century to the problem of origin and subjectivity. To whomsoever \napproaches that fortress in which we have taken refuge, and which we are determined to defend and to hold, we repeat, \nwith a gesture that wards off all profanation: 'Noli tangere'. \nBut I have obstinately gone on. Not that I am either certain of victory or sure of my weapons. But because it seemed to \nme that, for the moment, the essential task was to free the history of thought from its subjection to transcendence. For me, \nthe problem was certainly not how to structuralize it, by applying to the development of knowledge or to the genesis of \nthe sciences categories that had proved themselves in the domain of language (longue). My aim was to analyse this \nhistory, in the discontinuity that no teleology would reduce in advance; to map \n \n \n((224)) \nit in a dispersion that no pre-established horizon would embrace; to allow it to be deployed in an anonymity on which no \ntranscendental constitution would impose the form of the subject; to open it up to a temporality that would not promise \nthe return of any dawn. My aim was to cleanse it of all transcendental narcissism; it had to be freed from that circle of the \nlost origin, and rediscovered where it was imprisoned; it had to be shown that the history of thought could not have this \nrole of revealing the transcendental moment that rational mechanics has not possessed since Kant, mathematical idealities \nsince Husserl, and the meanings of the perceived world since Merleau-Ponty – despite the efforts that had been made to \nfind it here. \nAnd I think that really, despite the element of doubt introduced by our apparent dispute over structuralism, we \nunderstood each other perfectly. I mean, each of us understood perfectly what the other was trying to do. It is quite \nnormal that you should defend the rights of a continuous history, open both to the application of a teleology and to the \nendless processes of causality; but it was not to protect it from a structural invasion that failed to recognize its movement, \nspontaneity, and internal dynamism; in fact, you were trying to preserve the powers of a constituent consciousness, since \nit was really they that were in question.

But the major benefit, of course, is that it conceals the crisis in \nwhich we have been involved for so long, and which is constantly growing more serious: a crisis that concerns that \ntranscendental reflexion with which philosophy since Kant has identified itself; which concerns that theme of the origin, \nthat promise of the return, by which we avoid the difference of our present; which concerns an anthropological thought \nthat orders all these questions around the question of man's being, and allows us to avoid an analysis of practice; which \nconcerns all humanist ideologies; which, above all, concerns the status of the subject. It is this discussion that you would \nlike to suppress, and from which you hope, I think, to divert attention, by pursuing the pleasant games of genesis and \nsystem, synchrony and development, relation and cause, structure and history. Are you sure you are not practising a \ntheoretical metathesis? \n \n—Let us suppose that our dispute is where you say it is; let us suppose that our aims are to attack or to defend the last \nbastion of transcendental thought, and let us admit that this discussion is in fact situated in the crisis you describe: what \nthen is the title of your dis-course? Where does it come from and from where does it derive its \n \n((226)) \nright to speak? How could it be legitimated? If you have done nothing more than carry out an empirical inquiry devoted \nto the appearance and transformation of discourses, if you have described groups of statements, epistemological figures, \nthe historical forms of a body of knowledge, how can you escape the naivety of all positivisms? And how could your \nenterprise prevail against the question of origin, and the necessary recourse to a constituent subject? But if you claim that \nyou are opening up a radical interrogation, if you wish to place your discourse at the level at which we place ourselves, \nyou know very well that it will enter our game, and, in turn, extend the very dimension that it is trying to free itself from. \nEither it does not reach us, or we claim it. In any case, you have promised to tell us what these discourses are that you \nhave been pursuing so obstinately for the past ten years, without ever bothering to define their status. In short, what are \nthey: history or philosophy? \n \n—I admit that this question embarrasses me more than your earlier objections. I am not entirely surprised by it; but I \nwould have preferred to leave it in suspense a little longer. This is because, for the moment, and as far ahead as I can see, \nmy discourse, far from determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which it could find support. It \nis a discourse about discourses: but it is not trying to find in them a hidden law, a concealed origin that it only remains to \nfree; nor is it trying to establish by itself, taking itself as a starting-point, the general theory of which they would be the \nconcrete models. It is trying to deploy a dispersion that can never be reduced to a single system of differences, a \nscattering that is not related to absolute axes of reference; it is trying to operate a decentring that leaves no privilege to \nany centre. The role of such a discourse is not to dissipate oblivion, to rediscover, in the depths of things said, at the very \nplace in which they are silent, the moment of their birth (whether this is seen as their empirical creation, or the \ntranscendental act that gives them origin); it does not set out to be a recollection of the original or a memory of the truth. \nOn the contrary, its task is to make differences: to constitute them as objects, to analyse them, and to define their concept. \nInstead of travelling over the field of discourses in order to recreate the suspended totalizations for its own use, instead of \nseeking in what has been said that other \n((227)) \nhidden discourse, which nevertheless remains the same (and instead of playing endlessly with allegory and tautology), it \nis continually making differentiations, it is a diagnosis. If philosophy is memory or a return of the origin, what I am doing \ncannot, in any way, be regarded as philosophy; and if the history of thought consists in giving life to half-effaced figures, \nwhat I am doing is not history either. \n \n—From what you have just said, one must at least deduce that your archaeology is not a science. You allow it to \nfluctuate, with the uncertain status of a description. Yet another of those discourses that would like to be taken as a \ndiscipline still in its early stages, no doubt; which gives their authors the double advantage of not having to establish their \nexplicit, rigorous scientificity, and of opening up for it a future generality that frees it from the hazards of its birth; yet \nanother of those projects that justify themselves on the basis of what they are not, always leaving their essential task, the \nmoment of their verification, and the definitive establishment of their coherence until later; yet another of those \nfoundations, so many of which have been announced since the nineteenth century: for we know very well that, in the \nmod-ern theoretical field, what one is pleased to invent are not demonstrable systems, but disciplines for which one opens \nup possibilities, outlines a programme, and leaves its future development to others.

And the field that they were supposed to tend remains sterile for ever. \n \n—It is true that I have never presented archaeology as a science, or even as the beginnings of a future science. And I \nhave tried to draw up a survey — and in the process to make a good many corrections — of the work that I had done in \ncertain fields of concrete research, rather than produce plans for some future building. The word archaeology is not \nsupposed to carry any suggestion of anticipation; it simply indicates a possible line of attack for the analysis of verbal \nperformances: the specification of a level — that of the statement and the archive; the determination and illumination of a \ndomain — the enunciative regularities, the positivities; the application of such concepts as rules of forma-tion, \narchaeological derivation, and historical a priori. But in almost all \n \n \n((228)) \nits dimensions and over almost all its crests, the enterprise is related to the sciences, and to analyses of a scientific type, \nor to theories subject to rigorous criteria. First of all, it is related to the sciences that are constituted and establish their \nnorms in the knowledge archaeologic-ally described: for the archaeological enterprise, these sciences are so many \nscience-objects, as morbid anatomy, philology, political economy, and biology have already been. It is also related to \nscientific forms of analysis, but is distinguished from them either in level, domain, or methods, and juxtaposed to them \nby characteristic lines of division; by seizing, out of the mass of things said, upon the statement defined as a function of \nrealization of the verbal performance, it distinguishes itself from a search whose privileged field is linguistic \ncompetence: while such a description constitutes a generative model, in order to define the acceptability of statements, \narchaeology tries to establish rules of for-mation, in order to define the conditions of their realization; between these two \nmodes of analysis, there are, therefore, a number of analogies, but there are also a number of differences (in particular, \nconcern-ing the possible level of formalization) ; in any case, for archaeology, a generative grammar plays the role of a \nrelated analysis. Moreover, in their deployment and in the fields that they cover, archaeological descriptions are \narticulated upon other disciplines; in seeking to define, out-side all reference to a psychological or constituent \nsubjectivity, the different positions of the subject that may be involved in statements, archaeology touches on a question \nthat is being posed today by psychoanalysis; in trying to reveal the rules of formation of concepts, the modes of \nsuccession, connexion, and coexistence of statements, it touches on the problem of epistemological structures; in \nstudying the formation of objects, the fields in which they emerge and are specified, in studying too the conditions of \nappropriation of discourses, it touches on the analysis of social formations. For archaeology, these are so many \ncorrelative spaces. Lastly, in so far as it is possible to constitute a general theory of productions, archaeology, as the \nanalysis of the rules proper to the different discursive practices, will find what might. be called its enveloping theory. \nIf I situate archaeology among so many other, already constituted, discourses, it is not in order to give it some kind of \nstatus by association that it would be incapable of acquiring in isolation; it is not in order to \n \n \n((229)) \ngive it a definitive place in an unmoving constellation; but in order to reveal, with the archive, the discursive formations, \nthe positivities, the statements, and their conditions of formation, a specific domain. A domain that has not so far been \nmade the object of any analysis (at least, of what is most specific and most irreducible to interpretations and \nformalizations about it); but a domain that has no means of guaranteeing — at the still rudimentary stage of mapping at \nwhich I am at present — that it will remain stable and autonomous. After all, it may be that archaeology is doing nothing \nmore than playing the role of an instrument that makes it possible to articulate, in a less imprecise way than in the past, \nthe analysis of social formations and epistemological descriptions; or which makes it possible to relate an analysis of the \npositions of the subject to a theory of the history of the sciences; or which makes it possible to situate the place of \nintersection between a general theory of production and a generative analysis of statements. Lastly, it may turn out that \narchaeology is the name given to a part of our contemporary theoretical conjuncture. Whether this conjuncture is giv-ing \nrise to an individualizable discipline, whose initial characteristics and overall limits are being outlined here, or whether it \nis giving rise to a set of problems whose present coherence does not mean that it will not be taken up later elsewhere, in a \ndifferent way, at a higher level, or using different methods, I am in no position at the moment to decide. And, to tell you \nthe truth, it is probably not up to me to decide. I accept that my discourse may disappear with the figure that has borne it \nso far. \n \n—You make curious use of the freedom that you question in others. For you give yourself the whole field of a free \nspace that you even refuse to qualify. But are you forgetting the care with which you enclosed the discourse of others \nwithin systems of rules? Are you forgetting all those constraints that you described so meticulously? Have you not \ndeprived individuals of the right to intervene personally in the positivities in which their discourses are situated? You \nhave linked their slightest words to obligations that condemn their slightest innovations to conformity. You make \nrevolution very easy for yourself, but very difficult for others. It might he better if you had a clearer awareness of the \nconditions in which you speak, and a greater confidence in the real action of men and in their possibilities. \n \n \n",

The positivities that I have \ntried to establish must not be understood as a set of determinations imposed from the outside on \nthe thought of individuals, or inhabiting it from the inside, in advance as it were; they constitute \nrather the set of conditions in accordance with which a practice is exercised, in accordance with \nwhich that practice gives rise to partially or totally new statements, and in accordance with which \nit can be modified. These positivities are not so much limitations imposed on the initiative of \nsubjects as the field in which that initiative is articulated (without, however, constituting its \ncentre), rules that it puts into operation (without it having invented or formulated them), relations \nthat provide it with a support (without it being either their final result or their point of \nconvergence). It is an attempt to reveal discursive practices in their complexity and density; to \nshow that to speak is to do something – something other than to express what one thinks; to \ntranslate what one knows, and something other than to play with the structures of a language \n(longue); to show that to add a statement to a pre-existing series of statements is to perform a \ncomplicated and costly gesture, which involves conditions (and not only a situation, a context, and \nmotives), and rules (not the logical and linguistic rules of construction); to show that a change in \nthe order of discourse does not presuppose `new ideas', a little invention and creativity, a different \nmentality, but transformations in a practice, perhaps also in neighbouring practices, and in their \ncommon articulation. I have not denied – far from it – the possibility of changing discourse: I have \ndeprived the sovereignty of the subject of the exclusive and instantaneous right to it. \nAnd now I should like to ask you a question: how do you see change, or, let us say, revolution, \nat least in the scientific order and in the field of discourses, if you link it with the themes of \nmeaning, project, origin and return, constituent subject, in short with the entire thematic that \nensures for history the universal presence of the Logos? What possibility do you accord it if you \nanalyse it in accordance with dynamic, biological, evolutionist metaphors in which the difficult, \nspecific problem of historical mutation is usually dissolved? More precisely still: what political \nstatus can you give to discourse if you see \n \n \n((231)) \nin it merely a thin transparency that shines for an instant at the limit of things and thoughts? Has not the practice of \nrevolutionary discourse and scientific discourse in Europe over the past two hundred years freed you from this idea that \nwords are wind, an external whisper, a beating of wings that one has difficulty in hearing in the serious matter of history? \nOr must we conclude that in order to refuse this lesson, you are determined to misunderstand discursive practices, in their \nown existence, and that you wished to maintain, in spite of that lesson, a history of the mind, of rational knowledge, \nideas, and opinions? What is that fear which makes you reply in terms of consciousness when someone talks to you about \na practice, its conditions, its rules, and its historical transformations? What is that fear which makes you seek, beyond all \nboundaries, ruptures, shifts, and divisions, the great historico-transcendental destiny of the Occident? \nIt seems to me that the only reply to this question is a political one. But let us leave that to one side for today. Perhaps \nwe will take it up again soon in another way. \nThis book was written simply in order to overcome certain preliminary difficulties. I know as well as anyone how \n'thankless' is the task that I undertook some ten years ago. I know how irritating it can he to treat discourses in terms not \nof the gentle, silent, intimate consciousness that is expressed in them, but of an obscure set of anonymous rules. How \nunpleasant it is to reveal the limitations and necessities of a practice where one is used to seeing, in all its pure \ntransparency, the expression of genius and freedom. How provocative it is to treat as a set of transformations this history \nof discourses which, until now, has been animated by the reassuring metaphors of life or the intentional continuity of the \nlived. How unbearable it is, in view of how much of himself everyone wishes to put, thinks he is putting of 'himself into \nhis own discourse, when he speaks, how unbearable it is to cut up, analyse, combine, rearrange all these texts that have \nnow returned from silence, without ever the transfigured face of the author appearing: 'What! All those words, piled up \none after another, all those marks made on all that paper and presented to innumerable pairs of eyes, all that concern to \nmake them survive beyond the gesture that articulated them, so much piety expended in preserving them and inscribing \nthem in men's memories — all that and nothing remaining of the poor \n \n \n",

They cannot \nbear (and one cannot but sympathize) to hear someone saying: 'Discourse is not life: its time is not your time; in it, you \nwill not be reconciled to death; you may have killed God beneath the weight of all that you have said; but don't imagine \nthat, with all that you are saying, you will make a man that will live longer than he.' \nINDEX \na priori —8 Abel, N. 209 accounts book 93 \naccumulation 138—41 \nactuality: domain 68 \nAdanson, M. 65, 66, 177 \nadverb 92 \nage pyramid 93 \nalchemy 153 algebra 209 allegory 227 alphabet 96 \nanalysis: causal 18o, 182; of \ncontradictions 155; of the \nepisteme 211; physiocratic 187; of \nthe sign 159; symbolic 18o Analysis of Wealth 68, 72, 73, 74, 75, \n76, 77, 175, X85 \nanalysts 121 Anquetil-Duperron, A. 159, 187, \n188appropriation: rules and processes 75 \nappurtenances: symbolic 103 \narchaeology 8, 148, 169, 177, 188; correlations 179; description 171; history of ideas 151—95; isomorphisms 178; model \n178; shifts 178; territories 202 \narchive 142—8 \nAristotle 16o \nArnauld, A. 159 \nArtaud, A. 27 \narticulation 67 \natemporality: discontinuous 184 atomistic themes 153 \nattribution 67; of innovation 155; theory 184 \nBachelard, G. 4, 209 Balzac, H. de 25 Beauzee, N. 38, 184 \n((234)) \nBenoit de Maillet 39, 159, 202 Bernard, C. 207 \nBible 199 \nBiblical criticism 176 \nBichat, M.

    "chunk_full": "PREFA CE\nThe six \"hats to think\" allow us to lead our thought, as a director could direct his orchestra.\nIt is really possible to change the effectiveness, of the thought?\nIn January of 1985, the magazine Time it consecrated \"Man of the Year\" to that was last person\nin charge of the full success of the Olympic Games of the Angels: Peter Ueberroth. In these\nGames hundreds of million are lost generally of dollars. Although the city of the Angels had been\nagainst to spend municipal bottoms in the games, the Olympic Games of 1984 gave an excess of\n250 million dollars. The extraordinary success had a fundamentally new concepts and new ideas,\nimplemented with leadership and efectiveness.\nWhat class of thought generated these new concepts?\nPeter Ueberroth, in one interviews granted to Washington Post the 30 of September of 1984\nexplains how I use the lateral thought stops general new concepts.\nlateral thought is a technique that I developed many years ago. I have written many books on the\nmatter. Peter Ueberroth had attended char it of one hour which I gave in the Organization of\nYoung Presidents, nine years before.\nThere are many other examples of the way as a deliberate technique has great efect. My task it\nconsists of inventing the techniques and presenting/displaying them. Soon a corresponds\nindividuals, like for example Mr. Ueberroth. To choose them and to put them in practice.\nthought is the maximum resource of the human being. Nevertheless, never we are satisfied with our\nmore important capacity. It does not matter how good let us be, always we would want to be\nbetter. Generally, the only ones that is satisfied with its capacity with thought they are those\nthinking poor men who think that the objective to think is to prove that they are right --for its own\none satisfaction. Only if we have a vision limited of which it can thought, us can please our\nperfection in this land, but not of another way.\nThe dificulty main for the thought it is the confusion. We tried to do too much to same time. The\nemotions, the information, the logic, the hope and creativity oppresses to us. It is like making\njuggling with too many balls.\nIn this book I present/display a very simple concept that it allows the thinker to make a thing per\ntime. It allows to separate the logic of the emotion, the creativity of the information and thus\nsuccessively. This it is the concept of the six hats to think. To put itself one implies to define a\ncertain type of thought. Here I will describe nature and the contribution of each one.\n",

At least that said the guide to me while it indicated this occupied thinking\nlasting bronze carving to me.\nIn as much \"done \", this good can be erroneous in several aspect. It can not be an original one. It\ncan not have had two origínales. The guide could have itself mistaken. It can not be in the seat in\nfront of the legislative palace. It could to fail the memory to us. Therefore, why it would have to\nexpose something that does not have verified of an absolute way like a fact? There are many\nreasons.\nOne, that more it advanced in this book I will talk about of specific way the use of the facts.\nAnother one to irritate to which they think that the facts are more important that their use. In third\nplace, that I want that the reader visualizes that famous figure thinker, where she wants that she is\nthe same one.

You perceive that\nsomebody has insulted to you andfrom then all your thought on that person marks itself with that\nfeeling. You perceive (perhaps equivocadamente) that somebody interesadamente speaks and\nfrom then low regards everything to you what that person says. You perceive that something is\npropaganda and of there in more descrees of everything on the matter.

There are\nnew designs that use only six liters. This could save up to one hundred liters daily by person or\nthirty million liters per day.\n...What thinks to recirculate the water? I have heard that are new methods by membrane, that they\nmake economic. Also we would have less problems with the remainders. I can to investigate this\nsubject?\nEach one of these are a concrete suggestion. Once made the suggestion, it can to continue\ndeveloping finally and to put under in the opinion of the black hat and ofyellow hat.\n...Pónganse the yellow hats and make more suggestions concrete. Whatever more let us have,\nbetter.\n...John, what suggestion you have? How we could approach this problem? Ponte the hat yellow.\nTo this height, somebody could observe that the proposals must arise from \"expert in the subject\nof the water\" and that does not correspond that become fond of make those suggestions. The roll of\nthe fans serious to evaluate, with his critical thought, the proposals that present/display the\nexperts. This it is very typical style of the policy. The technicians are for proposing the ideas and\nto the politician he corresponds to evaluate them. In efect, it can have a roll in policy for this type\nof thought, but who take decisions are at the mercy of the experts. In other areas, like the personal\nthought or the one of businesses, thinker is his own expert and must produce the ideas.\nFrom where come the suggestions and the proposals? How the thinker does of hat yellow\nto give with a solution?\nIt does not have space in this book to develop the diferent methods from solution of designs and\nproblems. I have talked about to these subjects in other books. The proposals yellow hat they do\nnot need to be special or very ingenious. They can to include routine ways to treat those subjects.\nThey can include methods that it knows are used in other parts. They can include the conjunction\nof some well-known efects in order to construct a certain solution.\n",

The\nmovement it is a dynamic process, not of aging.\nWhat is interesting of this idea? What has of diferent? What suggests this idea?

This\nhappens to the lateral thought. The ability stops to use provocations is an essential part of the\nlateral thought.\nIn the section previous we observed the language of the movement. Thus we used the\nprovocations. We used them by its value of movement. We can now treat the way in which we\nstart up.\nFor many years; I invented the word \"op\"like symbolic indicator of which I know is exposing one\nit devises like provocation and by its value of movement. If they like, the expression comes from\n\"Provocative Operation\" (provoking operation).\nOp acts like a species of white flag of truce. Killing to a person who approaches a a castle\nshaking a white flag, would be not to follow the rules of the game. In the same way, juego if it is\nannihilated, with the judgment is not respected of black hat, one idea that is exposed under the\nprotection of op.\nIn certain way - as Isaid before -- the word op acts just as the trick of the hat green. The person\nwho uses the green hat is authorized to expose ideas \"crazy \". The green hat includes a phantom\nampler than op, although this last one is more specific. Therefore the best thing is to use itself\nboth.\n...The cars op must have square steering wheel.\n",

    "chunk_full": "Conclusion\nThe greater one enemy of the thought is the complexity, because he leads to the confusion. When\nthe thought is clear and simple it is more pleasing and efective. concept of the six hats to think is\nvery simple. Its use also she is very simple.\nThe concept of the six hats to think it has two central intentions. First it is to simplify the thought,\nallowing that the thinker treats a thing later of another one. Instead of being at the same time made\nposition of the emotions, the logic, the information, the hope and the creativity, the thinker can face\nthem by separated. Instead of using itself the logic to disguise an emotion by halves, the thinker\ncan take this emotion to the surface by means of the hat red and with no need tojustify it. The black\nhat to think can then to treat the logical aspect.\nThe second central intention of the six hats to think is to allow one variation in the thought. To a\nperson who in the course of a meeting has itself shown continuously negative, it is possible to be\nrequested to him that the \"hat takes of black \". This indicates the person to him who is being\npersistently negative. Also it is possible to be asked this person who puts \"the hat yellow \". This it is\na direct order of which she is positive. This way, the six hats provide a language that, without\nbeing ofensive, is precise. Most important it is than this\nlanguage does not threaten the ego or the personality of subject. One even becomes performance\nor a game. The six hats they allow that it is asked for to think of certain ways. The hats are thus a\nspecies of instructive shorthand.\nI am not insinuating that at any moment we would have to put a hat consciously to us or another one.\nIt is completely unnecessary. In some occasions it can that let us want to use all the hats in a\nsequence formally structured; in these cases we would have to expose the structure in advance.\nMore often we will want to put one or another hat to us with certain formality in the one course\ndiscussion. Or we can want to request to one of the presents that put a hat determined. This can in\nthe beginning seem somewhat strange but with time it will seem very natural\nObvious, the language obtains to Maxima utility if all the members of an organization they are to as\nmuch of the game rules. For example, all those that accustom to meet to discuss they would have to\nknow the meaning the diferent ones hats. The concept works better when it becomes a species of\ncommon language.\nSummaries\nMETHOD OF THE SIX HA TS TO THINK\nThe intention of the six hats to think it is to desembrollar the thought, so that the thinker can use a\nway to think after another one -- instead of to do all at the same time or to try it. The best\nanalogy is impression a all color. Each color is printed separately and in the end all meet and it sees\nthe set.\n",

    "chunk_full": "The method of the six hats to think are designed to remove to the thought from habitual\nargumentativo style and to take it to a cartographic style. This r does of the thought a process of two\nstages. First it is to develop the map. second it is to choose the route, in the map. If the map is\nsuficiently good, better route usually is obvious. As in the analogy of the impression to color, each\none of the six hats puts a type of thought in the map.\nIdo not try to afirm that the six hats include all possible aspect of the thought, but that includes the\nmain ways. I am not suggesting us either let us put one of the hats whenever we thought.\nThe greater value of the hats it is his same artificialidad. They ofer a formality and one convention\nto as much require certain type of thought of we ourself like of the others. They fix the rules of the\ngame of the thought. Whatever it plays it is going to know these rules.\nAt the most use the hats, will be integrated more to the culture of the thought. All the members of an\norganization would have to learn the basic language of way \"that can be incorporated to the\nculture.\nthought in center is thus much more powerful. Instead of wasting time in discussions and\nreasonings without course, will be counted on I raise energetic and disciplined.\nIn the beginning, it is possible that people feel a little uncomfortable with the use of the hats, but\n\"this incomodidad disappears as soon as the convenience of the system is evident. The first use of the\nhats will be an occasional order of to use one in particular b to change the black on the other\nhand.\nAs I said to principle of the book, the great value of the hats is that they provide rolls of thought. A\nthinker can be proud to represent each one of those rolls. Without the formality of the hats some\nthinkers they would suspend in a unique way (generally the black).\nI emphasize one time plus the easy thing that it is to use the system. It is not necessary that the\nreader make an efort in remembering all the points exposed in these pages. They constitute an\nextension the essential of each hat is easy to remember.\nHat Target, pure target, virgin, facts, numbers and information.\nHat Red, to see red, emotions and feelings, also prefeeling e intuition.\nHat Black, devil's advocate, negative judgm ent, reason by which he will not be.\nHat Yellow, light of the sun, brightness and optimism, positive, constructive, opportunity. Hat\nGreen,fertility, creativity, plants appearing of the seeds, movement, provocation. Hat Blue,\nmoderation and control, conductor, to think about thought.\nWhile more people learn the language, more useful will be in any organization. truth is that we did\nnot count on a simple language like system of control of our thought.\nIf us we felt so intelligent that we create to be able to do without this system, we could consider that\nthis system would do that that intelligence, of that as much we boasted ourselves, outside more\nefective still. A person with natural talent in order to run one benefits more than others if to that\n",

He is\nneutral and objective. It does not make interpretations nor it gives opinions. When it uses the hat\ntarget, the thinker would have to imitate the computer.\nThe person that it requests information must frame and need the questions in order to obtain\ninformation or to complete emptinesses of the existing information.\nIn practice exists a double system of information. The first level contains facts verified and\nproven, done offirst class. The second, facts that one thinks that they are true, but that has still not\nbeen totally verified, done of second class.\ncredibility varies from \"always true\"to \"never true \".

The\nhat red legitimiza the emotions and the feelings like one leaves important from thought.\nThe hat red it makes the feelings visible so that they can become partly of map and also of the\nsystem of values that chooses the route in the map.\nThe hat it provides the thinker with an advisable method to enter and to leave the way\nemotional; thus it can do it of a way that is not possible without this trick or instrument.\nThe hat red it allows that the thinker explores the feelings of the others when them it asks for puntó\nof Vista of red hat.\nWhen thinker is using the red hat, never it would have to make the attempt of to just ify the\nfeelings or \"to base them on the logic.\nThe hat red it covers two ample types with feeling.
