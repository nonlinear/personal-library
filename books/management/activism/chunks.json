As you may have already\nexperienced, digital teams are well known for evolving fast; you may be\nworking with a wide range of stakeholders, consultants, and experts from\nvarying disciplines who come and go throughout your projects. Holding on to a\nsense of close collaboration in an environment that is always changing can be\nchallenging.\n\nWhether you’re designing conversational interfaces, robots, self-driving cars\nor straight-up websites, your collaborations will always include people from\ndisciplines that you’re not used to working with. When every digital team is\nas diverse and unique as a snowflake, the one common factor in every\ncollaboration is **you**. What matters is how you approach the opportunity to\ncollaborate with others.\n\n### Who are your collaborators?\n\nAs a collaborator within a group, you may want to use this book to discover\nyour collective potential. Together, you have what it takes to create an\nentirely new ‘something’ that could never have been created by just one\nperson.\n\n![Graphic showing different types of collaborators](collaborators.jpg)\n![Chapter 1 Cover](chapter1.jpg)\n\n\n# Get Prepared\n\n> “In a complex, interconnected world it is simply impossible to do anything\n> substantial or worthwhile that does not involve collaboration across\n> multiple disciplines. The road to digital transformation involves building\n> bridges.”\n\nGerry McGovern Author of Transform, A Rebel's Guide to Digital Transformation\n\n## Find out where to start\n\nBefore you start your collaboration, you’ll want to know the nuts and bolts of\nwhy you are coming together as a group and what it is that you need to\nachieve. On digital projects, a [discovery\nphase](https://gathercontent.com/blog/run-website-discovery-session) is the\nperfect opportunity to determine the shape your team is going to take, and\nfigure out how you’re going to work.\n\n**A discovery phase might include:**\n\n  * Taking stock of what already exists\n  * Looking at areas of potential for the project\n  * Establishing a shared language for the group, including roles and tasks\n  * Giving shape to a project and defining the tasks ahead of you\n\n### What if you're joining a project that has already started?\n\nWhen the team are galloping ahead and getting down to business, it can feel\nawkward to say “I need to get the basics down before I can continue”.\n\nIf you’re asked to jump into a project and hit the ground running, you may\nfeel there isn’t enough time to get to know people and their responsibilities.\nYou might not even be familiar with the roles and disciplines that people in\nthe room have. The first rule of collaborative encounters is that the\nconditions are never as perfect as you might have hoped.\n\nIt can be helpful to use this phrase to guide you:\n\n**No matter how you start your collaboration,_this_ is the perfect starting\npoint.**\n\n## Collect dry facts\n\nWhether you have the luxury of conducting a discovery phase or not, your\nmission is to gather as many dry facts as you can.\n\nHere is a useful checklist of questions you can ask your team at the outset of\nany project, either in an email or in person. They are equally relevant\nwhether you're arriving to work as part of a pre-existing collaboration, or\nstarting afresh.\n\nGetting these questions answered will give you an immediate sense of the\nproject you are embarking on. The responses will give you a sense of how much\nground work there is to do either in the discovery phase of a project, or\nbefore you can continue.\n\n  * What are your collaborator’s names, what are their roles, how much time do they have?\n  * Is there an organisational chart?\n  * What are the time scales for this piece of work?\n  * How much work has been done already?\n  * Is there a deadline and are there milestones?\n  * What is the brief and is it clear?\n  * What is the budget? Who is in charge of it?\n  * Who are the stakeholders and who has the power to 'sign it off'?\n  * Are there any sensitive issues that need to be taken account of?\n  * Are there any potential blockers to getting started?\n  * Who are your allies in this process and who do you need to get on board?\n  * What tools are you using to communicate and to share the work?\n  * What is the environment like, do you need to arrange facilities?\n  * Is anyone facilitating? Leading the process? Acting as an outside eye?\n  * What are the immediate needs that your team members have?\n  * Is any training required to get people up to speed?\n  * Is there a brand guide, style guide or other governance materials?\n\nIf you have identified that there are any missing answers, make a note of them\nand allocate time to doing some further detective work.\n\nEmbarking on a project without a clear sense of the dry facts can be a\ndangerous game. It may be challenging to be the person who brings up the\n‘stupid’ questions, but sometimes those questions are the ones that everyone\nelse has been afraid to ask. The answers to many of the questions above may\nseem obvious, but the more obvious they are, the more likely they are to be\noverlooked, which could spell trouble further down the line.\n\n## Play with some raw materials\n\nIn the same way as a carpenter selects the log they will be working with, or a\ntheatre troupe selects a set of props to inspire them as they develop their\nshow, it can be useful to source a few initial raw materials to play with at\nthe start of a project.\n\nWhether you’re starting your collaboration at the beginning of the discovery\nphase, or you’re jumping into a pre-existing collaboration, raw materials can\nhelp you and your collaborators roll up your sleeves and get a sense of the\nmaterial you’ll be working with in the project ahead. Raw materials help you\nkeep your discussions grounded in reality.\n\nHaving something to look at together as a team, to put up on the wall and\npoint to during discussions, can be a helpful way to pull a group of\ncollaborators together from day one. It is important that you don’t start to\nanalyse, correct, draw conclusions or ‘fix’ the raw materials at this stage.\nThey should only serve as a springboard for collaboration.\n\n**Examples of raw materials include any artefacts that have been produced to\nsupport the project to date, and can include:**\n\n  * A project brief\n  * A project file with previous iterations\n  * A record of any recent ideas\n  * Sources of inspiration: e.g. on-site visits or coffee table magazines\n  * A pre-existing website\n  * Any existing brand language or brand guidelines (mission statements etc.)\n  * Printed marketing materials such as brochures or prospectuses\n  * Notes and sketches\n  * Moodboards (produced before you arrived)\n\n**Tip:** Many digital agency teams conduct a research phase or stakeholder\ninterviews to get close to the raw materials with their clients.\n\n\n## Case Study: Always have something to point at.\n\nAt the Government Digital Service (GDS) in the UK there’s a catchphrase known\nas ‘Show the Thing’.\n\nEven though this phrase was most commonly used to encourage people to _show_\nthe thing they had made, rather than talk abstractly _about_ the thing, the\nsame applies here. Having a concrete example, or a set of real artefacts to\npoint to can help you ensure that collaborative discussions don’t become too\nabstract.\n\nWebsite: <https://gdsengagement.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/04/what-we-mean-when-we-\nsay-show-the-thing/>\n\n![Chapter 2 Cover](chapter2.jpg)\n\n\n# Nurture the group culture\n\n> “If you put a lot of people together, there are a lot of dreams that are\n> trying to come into being from that group. And you want to try to cook them\n> up so they present themselves to the whole group so everyone thinks ‘Yes,\n> that is what I’m dreaming’.”\n\nPhelim McDermottOpera director at the English National Opera, Founder of\nImprobable Theatre\n\n## Find out what motivates you\n\nWhen you enter into new projects, the journey that you go on as a group _is_\nthe collaboration.\n\nTogether, you will be making a change.\n\nAt this stage, nurturing the collaboration is more important than the outcome.\nWhen teams create a dynamic that allows each member of the group to feel\nsafely challenged and supported along the way, a satisfying result will\nemerge.\n\n### Discover your own motivations and your group’s motivations.\n\nBy understanding each of your collaborators' motivations in the project,\nyou’ll get to know them better and find out what drives them. This will help\nyou understand who you’re working with and help you accommodate their needs\nthroughout the process.\n\n**Every collaborative project you enter into gives each individual a new\nchance to:**\n\n  1. Use their skills\n  2. Learn something new\n  3. Create something they are proud of\n  4. Make new connections\n\n**Take some time to think about what you want to get out of this process:**\n\n  1. What motivates you about this collaboration?\n  2. What do you hope for?\n  3. What would you like to have achieved by the end of this collaboration?\n\nPost these answers somewhere where you will see them. It can be easy to lose\nsight of your own mission when there are many voices at the table, so these\nwill be worth revisiting on a regular basis.\n\n**Tip:** When you see a greater mission emerging throughout the process, it\nmight be time to let go of your original mission. Be prepared to try and\nachieve a balance between give and take.\n\n### Know yourself\n\n> “The way you work within a team is influenced by your personality. It’s\n> important to be clear about your preferences, qualities, and attributes, as\n> well as those of your team members. This alignment of work styles will\n> improve communication and help the leadership and management of your\n> project.\n\n> Assess your own strengths and weaknesses. Know what matters most to you and\n> to the group, then look at how you’re spending your time. Track your time to\n> see how your activities align with both sets of priorities.\n>\n> Although there’s no one effective tool for personality assessment, tools\n> like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and\n> the DiSC® profile assessment can help you understand your natural\n> preferences and how you relate to other people.\n\n> By strategically preparing for change, we can understand our internal\n> audience, create a common vision, and use the right approach to help align\n> stakeholders.”\n\nMelissa BrekerContent Strategist, Coach, and Facilitator at Breker Group\n\n\n## Activity: Develop a shared understanding of your motivations\n\n#### Long term collaborations\n\nGo for a walk with each of your team members individually. Chat to them\ninformally about the process you’re about to embark on. Record the results of\nthe conversation together when you get back from your walk. You may wish to\nput the answers on a wall so that they can be shared and compared.\n\n#### Short term face-to-face collaboration\n\nAt the beginning of your session, ask each of your team members to take 3\nsticky notes. Give them at least 3 minutes to think about the answers to the\nquestions you answered earlier, about what motivates them. When they are\nready, ask them to stick the notes on the wall. Take the opportunity to have a\ndiscussion about where there are similarities and differences.\n\n#### Distributed team collaborations\n\nSend the questions out using a simple survey (Google Documents may be the\nsimplest). You may want to collectively discuss the outcomes on a video\nconference call.\n\n## Identify roles and responsibilities\n\nHave you ever been in a meeting where everyone goes around the room and\nintroduces themselves by their name and their job title, and then left the\nroom wondering what it is that people do?\n\nA job title is not enough of a description. At the beginning of a\ncollaboration you need to develop allegiances and learn who to turn to for\nexpertise. To do that, you need to spend time getting closer to the **story**\nof what people do.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nSpend a moment considering your own roles and responsibilities in relation to\nyour project.\n\n**Name 5 things that you associate with your role in this project:**\n\n  1.   2.   3.   4.   5. \n\n**Name 5 things that you think are your responsibility in the collaboration\n(these may not necessarily relate to your role):**\n\n  1.   2.   3.   4.   5. \n\n**Now ask yourself:**\n\n  * Do your collaborators understand what your responsibilities entail?\n  * What do you do to make sure your collaborators understand your role and responsibilities?\n\n### Defining your team\n\n> “Broaden the definition of who your team is: think about all the different\n> people at points in the project who are going to contribute to making the\n> project run smoothly. That's anyone who has an interest in the success of\n> the project.”\n\nJonathan KahnOrganiser of Agile Content Conf\n\n**Here are some useful tips when it comes to understanding one another’s roles\nand responsibilities before you begin the process:**\n\n  1. If people don’t already have one, ask them to write down their job description and share these with the group.\n  2. In longer term collaborations, ask people to share their skills (which may not even seem relevant), random knowledge areas and enthusiasms.\n  3. Make time in the process for knowledge sharing, so that everyone gets to understand one another’s roles and what they do in those roles.\n  4. Don’t forget that any new person coming to the process needs to be thoroughly introduced to the team and the work they’re doing.\n  5. Make time for your team to share stories about previous work they have done that has been relevant; sharing stories about roles and responsibilities is the fastest way to build a shared understanding of what is possible.\n\n\n## Activity: Run a RASCI session to establish how people are involved\n\nNot every collaborator will have the same level of involvement in the project.\nEvery time you meet a new collaborator on the project, ask them to choose from\nthe following options. Make sure that all members of the team can see what\nlevel of involvement each collaborator has.\n\n**Responsible:** At least one person needs to take this role and be the owner.\n\n**Accountable:** This may be the person who offers approval or sign off.\n\n**Supporting:** The support here may be defined as offering resources or other\nassistance.\n\n**Consulted:** This person needs to be kept in the loop because they have\nuseful skills or can offer information.\n\n**Informed:** This person needs to be kept in the loop at agreed points in the\nprocess.\n\n### Communication Plans\n\n> “Communication plans are a great way to share what, how, and when\n> information is shared and who is responsible for communicating information.\n> Do a web search for 'project communication plan template' to see some\n> samples for your projects.”\n\nMelissa BrekerContent Strategist, Coach, and Facilitator at Breker Group\n\n## Delegate and allocate responsibilities\n\n#### 'Fluffy Edges' - A project task delegation exercise\n\nIn every collaboration there is a list of goals to be reached, which include\njobs to be done. Jobs and tasks can be prioritised and allocated to people who\nseem to suit that task best.\n\nBut sometimes when you begin a project, it’s not always clear who is going to\ntake on the tasks that are a little 'fluffier'; no-one knows who should be\nresponsible for certain tasks.\n\nIn 'Fluffy Edges', the aim is to write out all the tasks that need to be\ncompleted to keep the project running, but when it’s not clear who might be\nresponsible for those tasks it can be helpful to get the entire group to have\na look at them.\n\n**Examples of 'fluffy edges' include:**\n\n  * Who is going to document the process on social media?\n  * Who is going to arrange the meeting room?\n  * Who is going to make sure we have snacks?\n\n\n## Activity: Work out your fluffy edges:\n\n  1. As a team, brainstorm your personal collection of ‘fluffy edges’, or the tasks that need to be done.\n  2. Write each one out on an index card.\n  3. Go through the cards systematically and decide together who should do each task.\n  4. Collect up the tasks that have been allocated to you.\n\n_A version of this task was introduced to the Clearleft team by Clare Kirkland\nand James Box, Agile project manager and UX Lead._\n\n### Bye bye, job titles\n\n> “The faster you can all forget your job title, the better. If you have a\n> clear understanding of what you are trying to achieve for your audience, the\n> goal is to bring all your expertise to solve that one problem. Work as one\n> team, no matter who you report to or what building you sit in, and you'll\n> get to that goal a lot faster.”\n\nSarah RichardsContent Strategist, Trainer & Consultant\n\n## Define your leadership\n\n> “Can a group of individuals together ask what a project wants, rather than\n> depending on the hierarchical domination of one person? Of course, a project\n> needs structure and a sense of direction, but can the leader aim for\n> discovery rather than staging a replica of what she or he has decided\n> beforehand?”\n\nAnne BogartChoreographer\n\nYou may or may not have a hierarchy in your team, or you may have a range of\npeople you are answerable to. There is often a misconception that a team is\n‘run by the boss’, or even a single leader.\n\nInstead, it can be useful to think of your team roles in a non-hierarchical\nfashion, but with various people ‘in charge’ of aspects of the collaboration:\n\n**The key stakeholder:** The person who will ultimately sign off the project,\nthey have the final say or the veto on decisions that need to be made.\n\n**The manager of logistics:** Scheduling, meeting arrangements, and other day\nto day housekeeping such as being in charge of how the budget is allocated.\n\n**The outside eye:** This person may stand in the shoes of the end user or the\naudience and help guide the work to meet their wants and needs.\n\n**The facilitator:** This person is not necessarily in charge, but helps you\nmake progress in your work by drawing out ideas by asking questions. They may\nalso keep an eye on the agenda.\n\n**The buddy:** A person who is allocated to support people in the team either\nin terms of their well-being, or as a person who offers a second opinion.\n\nIt is important to remember that any collaborator within your group can take\nthe lead at any time and initiate or invite the rest of the group to follow.\nThis is a sign of a healthy collaboration, where people take the risk of\nputting themselves forward and feel free to open their ideas up for debate.\n\nAs you are reading this book, you may feel like taking the lead in terms of\nbuilding healthy collaborative practices in your group.\n\n### “Decision-making styles\n\n> As projects progress, so do the needs of different decision-making. Some\n> project leaders prefer to stay highly involved at all stages of a project.\n> Think about how people on your projects participate and their natural style\n> of decision-making.”\n\nMelissa BrekerContent Strategist, Coach, and Facilitator at Breker Group\n\n## Fulfil your collaborators' needs\n\nThe more time you spend thinking about creating the ideal conditions for the\ngroup work, the more it will pay off. As humans, we struggle to be a willing\nparticipant when we are being deprived of our basic needs.\n\nIf you or your collaborators are suffering from low motivation, it can be\nhelpful to use Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as a troubleshooting checklist.\nAccording to Maslow, a social psychologist who studied what motivates us, we\nneed certain conditions to be met before we are able to thrive and fulfil our\npotential.\n\n![Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs pyramid diagram](hierarchy.jpg)\n\n#### Self-Actualisation\n\n  * Do you allow for playfulness?\n  * How do you make space for creativity?\n  * How do you make the most of the unexpected?\n  * Are people able to pursue satisfying challenges and take risks?\n\n#### Esteem\n\n  * How do people know they are valued and respected?\n  * How do you make the most of your successes?\n  * How do you deal with failure?\n  * Do people feel like it’s rewarding to be themselves?\n\n#### Belonging\n\n  * Is there time for people to get to know one another?\n  * Do people know who to turn to when things get tough?\n  * How do you facilitate getting to know one another?\n  * What values and mission hold the team together?\n\n#### Safety\n\n  * Where will people be greeted, do they have the right instructions?\n  * Do people feel free to express themselves?\n  * What are the health and safety procedures?\n  * Where and how can people take a break and relax?\n\n#### Physiological Needs\n\n  * Have you got good food to offer people as snacks and meals?\n  * Is there enough air in the room?\n  * Is there adequate wifi?\n  * What are the toilet facilities like?\n  * How accessible are the facilities?\n\n\n## Case Study: Well-being for remote teams\n\nSometimes it’s not possible for teams to be in the same room together. On a\nrecent project for a worldwide charity, one of our team members was based in\nScotland when we were in the South of England in Brighton.\n\nTo maintain a strong sense of collaboration with remote teams, it’s important\nto choose the right set of tools to collaborate with. We used Slack for quick-\nfire questions during the day, and Appear.in for video chatting.\n\nAs a team we conducted a daily video check-in at the same time each day. This\n5 minute check-in allowed time for informal chitchat, and a daily update.\n\nFor longer conversations we took regular breaks, allowing people to get tea\nand snacks. Sometimes the office dog and cats made an appearance too!\n\n### Tools!\n\n> “Most effective collaboration tools: tea (or coffee), biscuits (or cake),\n> respect and a shared goal. Nothing beats a proper chat.”\n\nSarah RichardsContent Strategist, Trainer & Consultant\n\n## Create a shared understanding\n\nLet's look at techniques for finding alignment and establishing a shared\nunderstanding with your team. At this stage, you may be interested in forming\na clear sense of the direction that you're collectively heading in. But in\norder to decide on the direction you're taking, you may also want to establish\na sense of your group's culture; what you stand for and what you believe in.\n\n![Circles of understanding diagram](circles.jpg) Credit: Anon\n\n### Find the differences in understanding\n\n**Take a moment to try out this exercise. If you have any other people around\nyou ask them to try it too.**\n\n  1. Think of an elephant.\n  2. Write down a short description of that elephant.\n  3. Share your descriptions with another person.\n\nWe all understand the idea or the concept of an elephant. But every person\nwill describe the elephant in their mind's eye differently. This exercise\nhighlights how differently we understand even the most basic concepts and how\nspecific we need to be if we want to find alignment with our collaborators.\n\nHaving a lack of clarity around a concept is a double edged sword. By\nlistening to our collaborators’ ideas around a concept, we might discover\nideas that we like and wish to take on board. Using the best parts of\neveryone’s ideas, a group might be able to create the ultimate picture of an\nelephant.\n\nA lack of clarity around a concept might also lead to frustration and\ndisagreement as people struggle to understand one another. When a concept\nseems so simple it can be difficult to acknowledge that your group may not be\naligned in their understanding.\n\n### Design begins with language\n\n> “Design begins with language. The spaces and contexts we design for have\n> their terms, their relationships, their rules. Gaining consensus means\n> aligning on a common mental model and a shared vocabulary that stems from\n> the language of your audience. Vocabulary is hard; it forces you to define\n> things, which forces the team to agree on that definition. But it clarifies\n> your intent and flushes out your points of difference to start off any\n> project from an understanding of how your world fits together. Vocabulary is\n> the infrastructure that underpins your content. It's the design behind the\n> design.”\n\nMike AthertonContent Strategist at Facebook\n\n## Multidisciplinary collaboration\n\nIn my agency life as a Content Strategist, I often work with people from\nmultiple disciplines at once. At any one time I may be working with a\ndeveloper, a user experience designer and a visual designer, as well as a\nsubject matter expert such as a museum curator, a doctor, or a travel\nspecialist (...agency life is varied!).\n\nMultidisciplinary collaboration is both challenging and rewarding because each\ndiscipline has their own unique understanding and perspective on a task. Each\nperson sees the task through a different lens. An engineer might be inclined\nto look at the workings of a car, whereas a visual designer might look mostly\nat the outer shell. But what happens if those two truly collaborate?\n\n> “Creative abrasion and creative agility are key to innovation. Maximise\n> differences and debate.”\n\nLinda HillAuthor of Collective Genius\n\nEntering into a conversation with people from another discipline can be\noverwhelming but also highly educational and enriching for a project. When\nworking together it is important to encourage an atmosphere of openness,\nallowing one another to ask for definitions of difficult language, and helping\none another understand concepts. In my work, I spend a large (and fruitful)\nportion of my time offering clarification on terms I might use, or decisions I\nmight make.\n\n## Working with diversity\n\nThe more diverse a group are, the richer the potential in the collaboration.\nHaving a diverse group can mean that your team members are of different ethnic\norigins, mixed genders, mixed cultural background, abilities, sexualities, or\neven characterful tendencies.\n\nMultidisciplinary collaboration becomes particularly important at the\nintersections where cultures and peoples' life experiences need to find ways\nto converge. The strongest forms of innovation occur where we **have to** find\na creative new way to understand one another’s unfamiliar languages and\nexperiences. Often it takes an interaction with someone outside of your frame\nof reference to point out something that you did not know.\n\n### Diversity and teams\n\n> “For teams, working with other people who have diverse needs and\n> capabilities can be hard. I find it beneficial to start within the team and\n> within the individual members to recognise the diversity of their own\n> capacities and communities. Broadening the sense of self within a team is a\n> way of making it more open to the diversity of other people who are\n> encountered through a design project. There is a strong normative bias to an\n> impossible ideal of user (in design). Self-recognition is a simple way of\n> strengthening a team and enabling positive relationships with real people\n> who can perceive and share completely new design spaces with you.”\n\nAlistair SomervilleSensory Design Consultant, @acuity_design\n\n## Find your shared language\n\nOne way to create a shared understanding of the 'thing' you are working on is\nto create diagrams and maps of associated language, discussing the\nrelationships between elements of your work with your team members. If you're\nin the same space, make sure you use the walls, covering them with records of\nyour discussions.\n\n![Example domain model diagram](domainmap.jpg)\n\n### Domain mapping\n\n> “Domain mapping is a powerful tool for teasing out and documenting a shared\n> understanding of the world in which the project exists – aka, its domain –\n> and establishing how we should refer to it. Don’t know how the rail shipping\n> industry works? A domain map visually shows that conductors drive trains to\n> pick-up points and use a shipment manifest to plan their day, and so on.\n>\n> Each actor, or noun, (conductor, train, manifest, etc) is an item on the\n> visual map and is connected to other actors by an action relationship, or\n> “verb”, lines (drives, uses…). These terms for actors and actions become the\n> shared project language. The team agrees to say “conductor” and avoid the\n> alternate term “train driver”. This graphical view also replaces reams of\n> project documentation that often gets put in a drawer after the analysis\n> phase is over and never gets updated.”\n\nNoz Urbina Content Strategist and Founder, Urbina Consulting\n\n\n## Activity: Take stock of your language.\n\n> “The words we choose change the things we make and how we think about them.\n> Our words also change how other people make sense of our work.”\n\nAbby Covert\n\nWhen a group of people come together from different disciplines, each person\nhas a sense of their own language; the words and behaviours they use to\nconduct the work they do. We might use the same words to describe something\nentirely different.\n\nE.g. When a Visual Designer talks about brand, they may automatically be\nreferencing the visual manifestation of the brand. When a Content Strategist\nrefers to the brand, they may be talking about the messaging and the stories\nthat the brand tells. I have often been in conversations where we’re referring\nto ‘rebranding’ and only realised after a long while that the conversation has\nbeen referring only to the visual aspects of the brand.\n\nIn the early stages of your collaboration, gather your group together and ask\nthem to write down their intentions. You may also want to use any of your raw\nmaterials, or your mission statement for this task.\n\nPull out meaningful (and perhaps obvious) nouns and phrases that keep\nappearing. For example, you may choose words like ‘Honesty’ or ‘Innovation’.\nYou may also want to pick up on groups of nouns, a phrase like 'digital\npresence' is often a great ambiguous place to start a discussion from.\n\nWrite these phrases on large sheets of paper and place them around the room.\nAsk the group to circulate around the room and write down definitions of what\nthey think that word means. Their sentences could start with: “This means…..”\nor “Like when….”. You will be surprised to find that people have a very\ndifferent understanding of many of the words.\n\nThis is a great starting point to help you build your own project vocabulary\nfrom, so that your entire team understand the definition (and what the big\nquestions are) before you start.\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n**How to make sense of any mess, by Abby Covert**\n\nWebsite: <http://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/>\n\n## Define your collaborative values\n\n> “Teams build a business. Culture builds a team.”\n\nDavid HieattDo Purpose\n\nEvery group has a culture that develops as you collectively grow and change.\nThinking about your values near the start of the project can be a way to fast-\ntrack your understanding of how you want to work together.\n\nThe values you have as a group can help you make decisions, and are\nparticularly useful when introducing a new team member, or giving people a\nsense of the way you work as your team grows and changes. When you have very\nlittle time, the idea of finding shared values and articulating your mission\ncan seem very daunting.\n\n**Take a moment to reflect on these questions:**\n\n  * How do you make decisions together as a team?\n  * How do you know what is ok, and what is not ok?\n\n\n## Exercise 1: Discovering your values\n\n**From 30 mins to 2 hours**\n\nThere are some fundamental human values that every functional team uphold, and\nno-one would argue the contrary; these include, trust, respect and\ninclusivity. But there are many more values you might choose. This exercise\nwill help your team discover the unique set of phrases that might form your\ncultural glue.\n\n**Step 1:** On a small piece of paper list 5 of your friends and 5 people who\ninspire you (ideally people who are relevant to your project). Tell your team\nthat they won’t have to share this part of the exercise.\n\n**Step 2:** Next to that list, write down what it is you enjoy about each of\nthose people’s ‘way of being’, preferably using two or three words _e.g\nfrivolous creativity, sensitive listening ear or challenging thinker, cosy\nhome maker._\n\n**Step 3:** Now ask each of your collaborators to write out their phrases (not\nthe names) on a sticky note.\n\n**Step 4:** Stick all the sticky notes on a wall.\n\n**Step 5:** Begin reorganising the notes randomly. Start to look for shared\nvalues between each individual’s notes, but also look at interesting\nopposites. As you do this, hold a group discussion about what your shared\nvalues could be. _E.g “Do we want to be challenging thinkers?” Make sure you\nanswer the following three questions:_\n\n  * What is it about the way you behave together that's special?\n  * If someone new came into the team, what would they need to know about you?\n  * Would the opposite also be true?\n\nFinally, try to prioritise just a few of the values.\n\nOnce you decide on your set of common values, you may decide to ‘try on’ your\nvalues for a while. In the same way as you would try on new clothes, wear them\nfor a few days or weeks and see if they fit comfortably.\n\n**Tip:** Conducting a ‘values’ exercise can often turn into “Let’s think of\nlots of great ways to compliment ourselves.” Be careful to be strict about the\nphrases that are unique to you.\n\n### Content workshops\n\n> “To promote collaboration in content workshops, prioritise building trust\n> over producing outputs. At first this will seem like slowing down. But if\n> you approach it with an open mindset, people will embrace the opportunity to\n> connect with each other. The more you focus on building trust, the easier\n> the group will find working together. It’s counterintuitive: you need to\n> slow down to move fast. For example, you might take the time to:\n>\n>   * ask people what they’re hoping to achieve during the workshop and draft\n> shared objectives\n>   * use post-it notes when coming up with ideas so that everyone contributes\n>   * resolve conflicts by listening to what people need (e.g. by asking,\n> “what would that get you?”)”\n>\n\nJonathan Kahn Organiser of Agile Content Conf\n\n### Convincing stakeholders\n\n> “Tell your stakeholders that you believe it's possible to find an approach\n> that satisfies everyone's requirements, even though there are differences of\n> perspective. If you show that you believe collaboration is possible, your\n> stakeholders will be willing to try it.”\n\nJonathan KahnOrganiser of Agile Content Conf\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n**The 5 Whys Activity**\n\nThis activity helps you establish the root cause of a problem. By doing so,\nyou create a purposeful starting point from which to work.\n\n<https://agileleanlife.com/5-whys/> <https://startwithwhy.com/>\n\n## Make a game plan: Aims, goals and objectives.\n\nTo identify the place you want to reach on your journey, the entire team needs\nto do some vision work. In order to do that, you need a realistic sense of the\ntime frame and the resources you have available to you.\n\nFor short term projects, or even a single workshop session, setting intentions\nwith your team will make sure that you stay on track, and that everyone gets\nwhat they need from the time you have spent together.\n\n### Goals\n\nYou may want an output that is an 'artefact', or it may be a less tangible\noutcome like 'build a stronger understanding'. It is important to agree on\nwhat your broad primary goal will be. Examples of goals might be 'make a new\nabout us page for the site' or 'strengthen the team's ability to write content\nindependently'.\n\n  * What goals would make your collaboration successful?\n  * What goals would make your project successful?\n\n### Objectives\n\nYour objectives support your mission and help you reach your end point. They\nare often quantifiable and can be measured. An example of an objective might\nbe 'increase likes by 20% in the next two months'.\n\n  * What kind of objectives would make your collaboration successful?\n  * What kind of objectives would make your project successful?\n\n### Aims\n\nYour aims aren’t measurable. Aims can be stated as fluid intentions or\nstrategies that you might use to help you meet your objectives.\n\n  * What kind of aims would make your collaboration successful?\n  * What kind of aims would make your project successful?\n\n### Tasks\n\nThese are the physical activities that the team undertakes to support the\nentire mission.\n\n  * What kind of tasks would make your collaboration successful?\n  * What kind of tasks would make your project successful?\n\n\n## Activity: Develop your trajectory.\n\n  1. Use a large roll of brown parcel paper (or the back of wrapping paper) to draw a very long arrow with a fat stem and lots of space inside it to add sticky notes.\n  2. Put it up on the wall.\n  3. At the end of your arrow write a goal, perhaps with a date assigned to it.\n  4. Give the team different coloured sticky notes and ask them to stick their objectives, aims, goals, tasks and tactics along the trajectory of the arrow to represent the timeline.\n  5. Use this timeline to develop a more formal project plan.\n\n## Define your collaborative mission\n\nIt can be useful to decide on a short statement that acts as a starting point\nfor the group.\n\nSome people may call this a mission statement, others may prefer to use a\nproposition statement or an elevator pitch (a marketing pitch that takes as\nlong to deliver as it takes to get to the 5th floor).\n\nWebsite projects may start with a hypothesis, or even a ‘provocation’ (if the\nintent is to shake things up a little). These starting points are all slightly\ndifferent, and you may choose to go for all of them. Whichever you choose, you\nneed a north star to guide you on your course.\n\n**Take some time to reflect on the answers to these questions:**\n\n  * What change do you hope to make with your group?\n  * How do you define the thing you're working on?\n  * Why does it exist?\n  * Do you think each person in your group would give this answer?\n\n\n## Exercise 2: Establishing your North Star\n\n### Preparation\n\nGive everyone 4 sticky notes. Ask them to write down their understanding of:\n\n**Note 1.** What the project is _e.g. To co-write a story, to create a\nwebsite, to invent a new project. (2 minutes)_\n\n**Note 2.** Who it is aimed at _e.g. for patients and carers, for people who\nlike animals, for people who have trouble reading. (2 minutes)_\n\n**Note 3.** Why it is unlike similar projects _(these may be by competitors)\n(2 minutes)_\n\n**Note 4.** Finish this sentence, using snippets from the sentences above:\n_“By the end of this project we will have created….” (5 minutes)_\n\nWhen you’re done, place all notes together on the wall; all number 1 notes\ntogether, all number 2 notes etc. Compare the language that each person has\nused.\n\n### Making your North Star\n\nNow draw a large star on a piece of paper. Big enough to hold at least 5\nsticky notes.\n\nAs a group the star can help you find consensus and decide which concepts you\nall agree on.\n\nIf you agree on a concept (or a word in the phrase), stick it inside the star.\nLeave all other concepts on the outside.\n\nNow work as a group to reformulate your statement based on the concepts inside\nthe star.\n\n### “Set benchmarks\n\n> Prepare Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure success. Uncover,\n> discuss and validate what great performance means for you as a team.\n>\n> Understand the difference between the overarching goal of impact versus\n> project output. Delivery is not necessarily success; it's about measuring\n> the things that matter, that have impact.”\n\nMelissa Breker Content Strategist, Coach, and Facilitator at Breker Group\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n**The graphic game plan from Gamestorming, Dave Gray**\n\nThis activity offers a similar take on how to develop your trajectory towards\nan end goal.\n\nWebsite: <http://gamestorming.com/games-for-decision-making/graphic-gameplan/>\n\n## _Start doing before you feel ready_\n\n## Define boundaries and constraints\n\n> “Constraints can spur creativity and incite action, as long as you have the\n> confidence to embrace them”\n\nTom & David KelleyCreative Confidence\n\n### Are we diverging or converging, and when?\n\nRegardless of the project management methodology you use (e.g. Agile or\nWaterfall) or the goals you have been set, there are some basic boundaries and\nstages you can define with your team as your project progresses.\n\nThe ‘double-diamond’ is a famous phrase in the design world. It can help a\nteam decide whether the phase they are in is opening up a question, idea or\nset of ideas (without looking for a solution yet, rather a set of possible\nsolutions) or whether they are trying to narrow down the focus. Setting a time\nlimit on your team’s divergent thinking and convergent thinking ensures you\ndon’t get lost in the research and dreaming phases of a project.\n\n![Double Diamond diagram](diamonds.jpg) Credit: Design Council\n<http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-\ndiamond>\n\n### What are your constraints and limits as a team?\n\n> “Small budgets require brave ideas”\n\nDavid Hieatt\n\nIt can be extraordinarily helpful for a team to take time to decide on their\nown constraints, and then stick to them.\n\nBringing schedules forward can spur teams of people into action, as can\nshrinking the budget, reducing the scope, shrinking a goal, or reducing the\nnumber of resources. The more dramatic the constraint, the greater the result\noften is. It’s a challenge though!\n\nWhat constraints might you set to spur you on?\n\nDon’t forget that conditions are never ideal. You may want to recall the\nphrase:\n\n'_This_ is the perfect starting point.'\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n**Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies: Random cards offering interesting\nconstraints for design projects.**\n\nWebsite: <http://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html>\n\n### What are your personal boundaries and constraints?\n\nTake a moment to think about any real boundaries or constraints you may have\nthat your team need to accommodate, or even embrace. These might include any\nof the following:\n\n**Physical or mental disabilities** _e.g. Dyslexia or colour blindness_\n\n**Physical or behavioural tendencies** _e.g. Needing time alone to think_\n\n**Access to tools and facilities** _e.g. Not having the right equipment_\n\n**Time** _e.g. Not being able to be present when the team are meeting_\n\n**Can you think of 6 more, even if they are constraints you wouldn't normally\nacknowledge?**\n\n  1.   2.   3.   4.   5.   6. \n\n### A personal story:\n\nOnce upon a time I worked with a theatre group. We spent 2 months working\ntogether, devising our performance for a puppet theatre, when I realised\nsuddenly that I hadn’t had time and space to think alone. I was then given 2\nweeks and a budget of less than £90 pounds to produce a puppet. I needed a\nshort amount of time away from the group to design him and make him, based on\nour original group work together.\n\nEvery expert needs a defined amount of time and space alone to gestate their\nideas, and then a set time to bring them back to the collaboration. It also\nhelped me that the budget was well defined too.\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n**The Design Council on the Double Diamond**\n\nWebsite: <http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-\ndouble-diamond>\n\n**Double Diamond of Collaboration, by Ben Sauer**\n\nWebsite: <https://slapdashery.org/collaboration-works-best-as-a-double-\ndiamond-bf0681c26aed#.6zpbp4u5n>\n\n## Decide on your tools\n\nMaking an early decision on tools and technologies you’re going to use to\ncollaborate with your team means you don’t have to disrupt the process later\non.\n\nIt also means that your collaborators can organise all the training,\npasswords, and admin rights they need, before disrupting the flow of the\nprocess.\n\n**When you’re deciding what form of collaborative tools to use, you might want\nto ask yourself these questions:**\n\n  1. How much training will each person need on the tools?\n  2. What kind of tool is easiest to dip into and catch up on the project status for those who are new to the project?\n  3. Who is responsible for deciding on the tools to use?\n\n### Communication\n\nWhat tools will you use to speak, chat, and generally communicate with one\nanother? What are the boundaries on your communications?\n\n_e.g. Slack, email, text message, phone, Basecamp, Appear.in, Uberconference_\n\n### Document creation and sharing\n\nWhat tools will you be using to share documents? What kind of documents will\nyou be sharing?\n\n_e.g. Your CMS, Word, Pages, Google Docs, GatherContent, Basecamp, Dropbox_\n\n### Scheduling, prioritisation, or backlog management\n\nWhere can people check in to make sure they are on track?\n\n_e.g. Google Docs, Basecamp, Google Calendar, GatherContent, Asana_\n\n### Workflow management\n\nWhere can people see what tasks have been allocated to them, and check in to\nmake sure the process is going smoothly?\n\n_e.g. Trello, GatherContent, Google Spreadsheet_\n\n### Snags, bugs, and feedback\n\nWhich tool is the easiest for everyone to keep track of (and allocate) changes\nto the work you’re doing, particularly on digital products?\n\n_e.g. Google Docs, Jira, Trello_\n\n**Tip:** If you are working in the same space as your team, it can be helpful\nto put tasks and developments up on the walls around you. It’s always easier\nto have something offline to point at.\n\n![Chapter 3 Cover](chapter3.jpg)\n\n\n# Maintain good practice\n\n> “Other people have so much to recommend them, they will help you see outside\n> yourself; they will rally when you’re flagging, they will offer ideas that\n> push you to be better. But they will also constantly require interaction and\n> communication. Other people are your allies, but that alliance takes\n> sustained effort to build. And you should be prepared for that, not\n> irritated by it.”\n\nEd CatmullFrom Pixar, in Creativity Inc.\n\n## Maintain healthy communication\n\n> “We seldom say ‘That’s a bad idea’ or ‘That won’t work’. When we disagree\n> with someone else’s idea, we push ourselves to ask ‘What would make it\n> better? What can I add?... When a group embraces the concept of building on\n> the ideas of others it can unleash all sorts of creative energy.”\n\nTom & David KelleyCreative Confidence\n\nThe secret to the momentum and flow in any successful collaboration lies in\nthe way people communicate with one another, and the way they set up their\ncommunications. Part of the art of good communication, is to become self-aware\nof your own style of communication.\n\n**Take a moment to reflect on the way you communicate. There are no right or\nwrong answers to these questions.**\n\n  * How might you describe your tendencies when you communicate?\n  * How do other people receive the way you communicate?\n  * What would you like to improve about the way you communicate?\n  * Do you plan what you are going to say while people are speaking?\n  * How do you deal with confrontation or rejection?\n  * Do you make eye contact with people?\n  * Are you more of a yes person than a no person, or the other way around?\n  * What is your sense of timing like?\n  * How do you deliver difficult feedback?\n\nIf you feel comfortable doing so, it can be helpful to share these answers\nwith your group. In this way, you can manage expectations and be aware of one\nanother’s communication styles.\n\nTechniques for collaborative communication abound and could fill an entire\nbook in themselves. Here are two communication techniques you can try:\n\n\n## Technique 1: Develop your listening skills\n\n> “Real conversation is where people speak, listen, and have the potential to\n> be changed.”\n\nLee SimpsonImprovisor, The Comedy Store, London\n\nWe often say \"He or she didn't listen\" when we don't feel we've been heard.\nBeing able to listen attentively is about being **non-judgmental** when\nsomeone is speaking, and **temporarily abandoning your plan** for what you are\ngoing to say next. This is a helpful exercise that allows you to loosen your\ngrip on the direction you want something to take.\n\n### Exercise:\n\nSit opposite a partner. You are both going to tell a story, one word at a time\nwithout pausing for too long to think about the next word. For example:\n\n  * **Person 1:** Once\n  * **Person 2:** upon\n  * **Person 1:** a\n  * **Person 2:** time\n  * **Person 1:** high\n  * **Person 2:** in\n  * **Person 1:** the\n  * **Person 2:** sky\n\nDo this for 5 minutes, and then spend some time analysing the results. How did\nyou feel? Often people feel frustration that the story is not going in the\ndirection they intended, or that it takes funny turns.\n\n_Inspired by: an improvisation theatre workshop with Lee Simpson_\n\n\n## Technique 2: Dealing with conflict without judgement, blame, or criticism\n\nIt is somewhat inevitable that you will hit challenging patches in your\ncommunication with collaborators. Approaching a conflict in this way reduces\nthe level of antagonism between two people. The more pressure that is on, the\nmore a deadline looms, it can be easy to fall into unhelpful patterns of\ncommunication.\n\nTo help you express what is working for you, and what is not, try this\nexercise to form sentences that do not blame or criticise. Try it alone first,\nbefore working with others.\n\n  1. Choose a situation in which you felt conflicted. _E.g. I was offended by my colleague, they talked over the top of me._\n  2. Make an observation by saying \"I observed that (I saw, heard, felt, or noticed)\" _E.g. \"I noticed that you started talking when I was talking\"_\n  3. Say how you feel about it in emotional terms \"I felt... mad/ sad/ angry/ scared\" _E.g. \"I felt annoyed.\"_\n  4. Now say what you need or what you value _E.g. \"Because I needed to express my opinion.\"_\n  5. Make a clear request. _E.g. \"Could you give me a moment to express my opinion.\"_\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n**Non-violent Communication, by Marshall Rosenberg.**\n\nFurther sources and explanation: <http://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Nonviolent-\nCommunication>\n\n**Clean Language, by David Grove**\n\nWebsite: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Language>\n\n## Advice from our experts on effective communication:\n\n> “All teams manage a certain level of chaos and uncertainty. Through clear\n> expectations, you can reduce conflicts and assumptions, set standards, and\n> improve alignment.\n>\n> Keep people informed and be transparent about how decisions get made, when,\n> and how. Let them know about your needs when it comes to timing, material,\n> and other support. Identify risks in advance to reduce firefighting and last\n> minute requests.”\n\nMelissa Breker Content Strategist, Coach, and Facilitator at Breker Group\n\n> “The key to resolving conflict is to discover the underlying needs that\n> drive our different strategies. Don't assume you understand **why** someone\n> is asking for a specific route or strategy. Instead, ask them what that\n> strategy would achieve. Once you understand the needs, you can invite people\n> to work together to find solutions that meet everyone's needs, without\n> compromise.”\n\nJonathan Kahn Organiser of Agile Content Conf\n\n> “I've found the most important thing to making us active listeners is to\n> remember: other team member's motivations are their own, and people engage\n> best when they understand how your motivations line up with theirs. Remember\n> that understanding what people are going for, and their concerns about\n> getting there, is essential to you getting your own things done.”\n\nNoz Urbina Content Strategist & Founder, Urbina Consulting\n\n## Establish team rituals\n\nEvery time people begin a piece of work together, they automatically begin to\nestablish a culture with a ‘way’ of doing things.\n\n**Having regular team rituals can help to make this culture explicit for the\nfollowing reasons:**\n\n  * If a newcomer joins, they know how to fit in easily\n  * If there is a problem or dispute, it can be sorted out face to face (even if it’s over a video conference call)\n  * When the team members can relate socially, people connect and collaborate with greater ease\n  * Rituals create a sense of routine, and a place to come back to, particularly when the pressure is on\n\nSometimes a team’s way of working grows organically and comfortably over time\nbut it can be helpful to stop, take stock and decide on the habits and rituals\nthat would be helpful for you. You can set up rituals to occur daily, weekly\nor monthly, or at intervals that suit the team.\n\n\n## Ritual 1: The 5 minute daily standup\n\nThe Agile methodology popularised this method of allowing teams (particularly\ngroups of people working together from different disciplines) to check in with\none another daily to talk about their project progress.\n\n**At the beginning of the day, each person stands up, and in turn they\nstate:**\n\n  1. What they did yesterday\n  2. What they're going to do today\n  3. What their blockers are\n\nFor dispersed teams, a video conference and a daily stand up call can be\ncrucial for keeping the team on track.\n\n\n## Ritual 2: The meeting check-in\n\nDo you ever find yourself trying to mind-read a person’s mood during a\nmeeting? We often bring feelings and moods into our meetings that have little\nto do with our collaborators. It can be healthy to find out ‘where people are\nat’ before the meeting starts.\n\n**Here’s how it works:**\n\n  1. Once everyone is settled, say something to the effect of “I’d like to ask how everyone is?” or “Let’s do a quick check in, just to see where everyone is at before we start.”\n  2. Go round the table and hear everyone’s statement. The emphasis should be on how people are feeling, rather than their opinions about the meeting.\n  3. Try to prevent people responding to each other’s statements. Don’t comment on people’s feelings if you can help it, and certainly don’t disagree with anything anyone says. You don’t want to start a discussion.\n  4. You might want to check out at the end of the meeting. In our company we found these to be particularly fruitful in unexpected ways.\n\n## Set up governance and a workflow\n\nGovernance is a term that loosely refers to the standards, policies,\nresponsibilities and guidelines that holds the project or a team together.\nOnce you’ve set up healthy collaborative practices, governance can help set\nthese practices in stone and future-proof your work.\n\nAs your project progresses, different people may be involved in the decision\nmaking at various stages. Having a set of rules, clear documentation and\nallocating responsibilities to key individuals means that you don’t have to\ndown tools and go into tactical debates at each turning point.\n\n**Clear governance helps you:**\n\n  * Maintain consistency\n  * Know who is in charge of certain aspects of the project\n  * Stay on-brand\n  * Fulfil your project goals\n  * Scale your project\n\nEven if the individuals on a project change, go on holiday, or if the project\nstops and starts, having a clear governance framework means that you won’t\nblow off course.\n\n**Here is an example of a set of governance tools for content projects:**\n\n  * A tone of voice document for writers and editors\n  * A style guide for writers and editors\n  * A set of content principles\n  * A schedule for the content production\n  * A workflow: a framework that states who is conducting writing, editing and fact checking at each stage\n\n![Sample workflow screenshot from GatherContent](workflow.jpg) Sample workflow\nfrom GatherContent\n\n**An example of a set of governance tools for digital projects in general:**\n\n  * Documentation on a digital strategy\n  * Documentation on a digital policy\n  * Documentation on digital standards\n  * Brand guidelines\n  * Editorial guidelines\n  * An organisational chart of the digital team and their place in the organisation\n  * A framework that states who will be editing and signing off pieces of work at each stage\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n**Managing Chaos, Digital Governance by Design, by Lisa Welchman, Rosenberg\nBooks**\n\nWebsite: <http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/managing-chaos/>\n\n## Introduce new members of the team\n\nIntroducing a new collaborator to the team takes time and careful attention to\ndetail. No matter how long this person will be working with you, make sure\nthat you dedicate time and adequate resources to handing over the information\nthey need to do their job.\n\n#### Comfort\n\nConsult Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to make sure this person has the\nfacilities they need in order to be able to do their job.\n\n#### Context\n\nTake time to offer your new collaborator a lot of context around the task they\nwill be working on, this will make it much more meaningful to them, and allow\nthem to see their place in the big picture. Offer them raw materials to start\nwith, as well as any information they need about your group values, mission\nand any other language you have created as a group.\n\n#### Instructions and managing expectations\n\nClearly set out your expectations in relation to this person’s role, including\nthe amount of time you will need them to collaborate for, what you want them\nto do, and what you hope the outcome to be.\n\n#### Time alone\n\nAllow time for this person to get up to speed. They may need some independent\ntime to work through any existing documentation, and begin to formulate a\nplan.\n\n#### Challenge\n\nIt is ok to offer this person a challenge that they can get stuck into\nstraight away. Keep the first challenge small, so that you can enter a\nfeedback loop as soon as possible.\n\n## Feedback\n\n### Take a moment to think about the kind of feedback you would find most\nuseful.\n\nFinding a time and an appropriate method for delivering feedback to your\ncollaborators can be challenging if it isn’t baked into the process from the\nbeginning. You may want to agree how and when you deliver feedback to one\nanother.\n\nIf you wish to give someone feedback, you may want to check whether they are\nin the right frame of mind to receive it. Asking people if they are available\nand willing to receive feedback is a good way to prepare the ground.\n\n\"Would now be a good time to offer you some feedback?\"\n\n### Constructive criticism.\n\nDelivering constructive criticism to a team member can be a sensitive issue.\nIt is important to speak with positive intent and get straight to the point.\nHere are some ideas on how to frame the conversation.\n\n**Make the content of your feedback:**\n\n  1. Timely - When did it happen, and what happened?\n  2. Relevant - Who and what was it in relation to?\n  3. Specific - What are the exact details and what was the impact?\n\n**Spend some time thinking about your approach to giving feedback, and make\nsure that it is OPEN:**\n\n  * **O** pen Minded - Ask the person what their perception of the situation is? Is it different from yours?\n  * **P** ositive - Ask yourself ‘What is good about this situation?’ and identify a positive reason for having the discussion.\n  * **E** mpowering - Ask the individual what they think the best solution might be, and what support they might need to act on the feedback.\n  * **N** on-judgemental - Describe the situation without bias and help the recipient of your feedback work towards their own conclusion.\n  * Finally, make sure you agree on the outcome of the discussion, so that you both know what you are taking away from it.\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n**Non-violent communication: A language of life, by Marshall Rosenberg.**\n\nWebsite: <http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com>\n\n### Giving and receiving feedback\n\n> **“Giving feedback:**\n>\n> Personally, I love giving feedback about content in critique sessions. They\n> are a place where the whole team (designers, developers and content) sit\n> around and talk about content that has been produced.

A lot of people don’t do that; they\n> feel they have to justify their position then and there. If the person\n> pushes for a response, go to HR. That is not ok.

Disseminate all feedback, and don’t\n> forget to celebrate the wins!”\n\nRobert MillsContent Strategist at GatherContent\n\n## Broadcasting and education\n\nEvery time you collaborate with a group of people, you will have learned\nsomething that will be helpful to others. At Clearleft, every time we finish a\nproject we broadcast and educate the team with our learnings via the medium of\nblog posts, case studies, and conference talks. We also do talks for the rest\nof our own team, so that they might learn from our experiences.\n\nIn the excitement of finishing a collaboration, it can be all too easy to\nsprint to the end line whilst forgetting that it may be more helpful to pass\nthe baton to other people in your organisation. The most sustainable approach\nis to empower other people to follow in your footsteps, and offer them the\nopportunity to use the work you have done to enhance their own. You may wish\nto set up training sessions, or put some design time into creating a helpful\ndocument than can be referred to by anyone who takes over your work.\n\n  * What do you feel you learned from this collaboration?\n  * What can the rest of your company learn from the work you've done?\n  * How would it be best to communicate it to the wider organisation?\n  * What's the best format for wrapping up the work you've done?\n\n## Run a retrospective\n\nOnce your collaborative process is complete, it’s time to run a retrospective\n(or more sinister people might call it a 'Post-Mortem').\n\n**According to Ed Catmull of Pixar and Disney fame, there are 5 reasons to\nspend time looking back on what you have done _(From Creativity Inc. p.216)_\n:**\n\n  1. “Consolidate what's been learned” - bring clarity to the lessons learned on the project\n  2. “Teach others who weren't there” - use it as a forum for learning about what others went through\n  3. “Don't let resentments fester” - allow closure on issues that came up in the project\n  4. “Use the schedule to force reflection” - this forces people to spend time reflecting before the post-mortem has even happened\n  5. “Pay it forward” - raise questions to be asked on the next project\n\n\n## Activity: Walking the timeline\n\nDuring a recent retrospective, our project manager Matt Matheson asked us to\nphysically walk through the timeline of a year long project.\n\nUsing four pieces of paper evenly spaced out on the floor, we took it in turns\nto walk the route in front of the team and mark moments which were memorable\nfor us along the way.\n\nThis activity gave insight into people’s different perspectives and the\nmeaningful moments for them.\n\n_Inspired by a workshop with Matt Matheson at[Improvising\nChange](https://www.improvisingchange.co.uk/) in Brighton_\n\n## Celebrate\n\nWhen we work on projects, we can often spend the journey being fixated on the\noutcome, and on ‘getting to be’ a success. But how often do we celebrate that\nsuccess?\n\nCelebration can be as small as a compliment or acknowledgement, or as large as\na party.\n\n**Take a moment to reflect on a project you have completed:**\n\n  * What constituted success during the project?\n  * What constituted success at the end of the project?\n  * Did you celebrate your successes along the trajectory of the project?\n  * Did you celebrate at the end of the project?\n  * How did you celebrate?\n  * How would you like to celebrate success in future?\n  * Did you achieve what you wanted to?\n\n\n# Thank you for reading this book\n\nCollaboration is exercise. On a daily basis that exercise of collaboration\npractically demands that every group member thinks about their own ‘way of\nbeing’ and takes responsibility for creating the conditions in which a\ncollaboration can thrive. Every day is a new opportunity to look at how you\ncan improve collaborative practices with everyone you work with.\n\nAs a result of reading this book, take a moment to think about how you intend\nto approach your next collaboration and write your intentions below.\n\n**These are the things I intend to carry into my next collaboration:**\n\n  1.   2.   3. \n\nGood luck!\n\n**Ellen de Vries**\n\n\n# About the Author\n\nEllen de Vries is a Content Strategist at Clearleft, a strategic design\nconsultancy based in Brighton, UK.

We thrive when we are immersed in it, suffer when\ndeprived of it, and wherever humans go we create it. We define ourselves by\nour communities: tribe, family, work, clubs, schools, churches and temples,\nthese are who we are. We are born into community, and if we’re lucky we’ll end\nour days surrounded by it.\n\nIt’s no surprise that as soon as humans began to go online, communities\nformed, but as easy and natural as group formation is for us in real life, we\ncan find it frustrating online. Many of the cues that grease the wheels of\nhuman interaction in person are missing online. Gone is the grin that can\nsoften a criticism, the pat on the back that can heal a rift. How can you “hug\nit out” when your antagonist is a continent away and you know no more about\nhim than his handle and a few lines of signature? Online groups can breed the\nmost vicious of rivalries. The Hatfields and McCoys have nothing on\n_alt.tv.doctorwho_.\n\nCommunities are tough enough to maintain when you’re all in the same room; how\nmuch harder is it to build, maintain, and nurture a community online? That’s\nwhy this book is such a boon to those who run communities and the rest of us\nwho participate in them. Jono Bacon has firsthand experience with managing a\ngroup of the most bloody-minded and independent people on the planet: open\nsource programmers. The information in this book has been forged in the white-\nhot crucible of free software. You don’t get tougher than that.\n\nMy experience with online forums began 25 years ago when I started a bulletin\nboard for Macintosh users called MacQueue. It’s not easy to start a flame war\nwith dual 14.4 kbps modems and 20 MB of storage, but the MacQueuers managed. A\nfew years later I joined The Well, a legendary online community based in\nSausalito, California, and imbued with the peace and love ethos of the San\nFrancisco hippies. That didn’t last long. The Well went through an arc I came\nto know intimately, one that most online communities seem to follow.\n\nWhen any affinity group forms online it’s a joyous occasion. The founders and\nearly members are wreathed in the cooperative enthusiasm that accompanies most\nnew beginnings. Conversations are civil, helpful, and kind. Posts twinkle with\ngood spirits and bonhomie. All’s right with the Web. Then the rot begins to\nset in. Tempers flare, resentments build, rivalries form. It’s a lot like\nmarriage.\n\nUnlike most marriages, however, online members have looser ties to the group\nand a reduced stake in its success. When trolls become annoying, the flame\nwars too fiery, members move on, and pretty soon that happy online forum turns\ninto a ghost town, or worse.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way. With his usual wit and good humor, Jono\nhas written a guide with everything you need to keep your online groups\nhealthy and productive. With proper planning, a modicum of guidance, and the\noccasional banishment, your community can avoid that seemingly inevitable\ndescent into fear and loathing. We need good community managers because we\nneed healthy communities online. I’ve started my share of communities online,\nand killed a few with neglect, too. I’m so grateful to Jono for giving me the\ntools to do it right from now on. I know we all are.\n\n—Leo LaporteBroadcaster and Founder of the TWiT Network Petaluma, California\nJune 30, 2009\n\n\n# Foreword\n\nWhen I’m not running _Wired_ , I run a community called DIY Drones. Here more\nthan 20,000 members collaborate to make open source unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs), which are essentially fully autonomous airplanes, helicopters, and\nother things with spinning propellers that fly all by themselves.\n\nThe DIY Drones community has created countless products, but the most\nsuccessful is ArduPilot, a series of autopilots based on the Arduino computing\nplatform. We’re part of the Open Hardware movement, which is to say that there\nis both a software and a hardware element to the autopilots our community\ncreates, and both are open source. Although I and others also have commercial\ncompanies that make and sell this hardware (mine is called 3D Robotics), under\nthe terms of the open source license, anybody, absolutely anybody, can use the\ndesigns our community creates and make them to compete with us. It may sound\ncrazy, but such openness can create innovations faster, cheaper, and better\nthan traditional closed source research and design in regular companies. The\nonly risk is that some other company will clone the product and sell it for\nless, fully within the legal terms of the license.\n\nThis is exactly what happened in late 2010. We got word that Chinese copies of\nour ArduPilot Mega design were for sale on Taobao, eBay, and other online\nmarketplaces. And indeed they were—well-produced, fully functional clones. Not\nonly that, but our English instruction manual had been translated into\nChinese, too, along with some of the software.\n\nOur community members reported this blatant “piracy” and asked what we were\ngoing to do about it.\n\nNothing, I said:\n\n> This is both expected and encouraged in open source hardware. Software,\n> which costs nothing to distribute, is free. Hardware, which is expensive to\n> make, is priced at the minimum necessary to ensure the healthy growth of a\n> sustainable business to ensure quality, support, and availability of the\n> products, but the designs are given away free, too. All intellectual\n> property is open, so the community can use it, improve it, make their own\n> variants, etc.\n>\n> The possibility that others would clone the products is built into the\n> model. It’s specifically allowed by our open source license. Ideally, people\n> would change/improve the products (\"derivative designs\") to address market\n> needs that they perceive and we have not addressed. That’s the sort of\n> innovation that open source is designed to promote. But if they only clone\n> the products and sell them at lower prices, that’s okay, too. The\n> marketplace will decide.\n>\n> BTW, the Arduino development boards have gone through exactly the same\n> situation, with many Chinese cloners. The clones were sometimes of lower\n> quality, but even when they were good, most people continued to support the\n> official Arduino products and the developers that created them. Today,\n> clones have a small share of the market, mostly in very price-sensitive\n> markets such as China. And frankly, being able to reach a lower-price market\n> is a form of innovation, too, and that is no bad thing.\n>\n> Personally, I’m delighted to see this development, for four reasons:\n>\n>   1. I think it’s great that people have translated the wiki into Chinese,\n> which makes it accessible to more people.\n>\n>   2. It’s a sign of success—you only get cloned if you’re making something\n> people want.\n>\n>   3. Competition is good.\n>\n>   4. What starts as clones may eventually become real innovation and\n> improvements. Remember that our licence requires that any derivative designs\n> must also be open source. Think how great would it be if a Chinese team\n> created a better design than ours. Then we could turn the tables and produce\n> their design, translating the documentation into English and making them\n> available to a market outside China. Everybody wins! (Hey, a guy can dream\n> ;-) )\n>\n>\n\nShortly after I wrote this, a member named “Hazy” responded in the comments\nthat he had been working with the team that had made the boards, and was the\none doing the translation. I complimented him on the speed at which it had\nbeen done, and then asked him if he’d consider porting the translation to be\npart of our official manual, which takes the form of a wiki on Google Code,\nwhere our repository is. He agreed to do so, and I gave him edit permission to\nthe wiki and otherwise set it up for a parallel Chinese translation that users\ncould select.\n\nAt the time, we were using the Subversion version control system (we’re now\nusing Git), and Google Code had a relatively basic implementation of it. The\nwiki pages were just files in the same repository as the source code for our\nautopilots, and I hadn’t investigated the permissions options very well. To\nlet people edit the wiki, I just gave them blanket \"commit\" access (the\nability to create and edit files) to the whole repository.\n\nWhen I gave community members such access, I usually asked them not to mess\nwith the code by mistake (membership in the code development teams was more\nexclusive, because the danger of messing things up was higher), but in the\ncase of Hazy, I forgot.\n\nThe first thing Hazy did was integrate the Chinese translation of the manual\nseamlessly, so users could simply click a link to switch easily between the\ntwo languages.\n\nThen, because he was an expert in our autopilot (he had, after all, been part\nof the team that cloned it), he started making corrections in the English\nmanual, as well. I could see all the commits flowing by and approved them all:\nthey were smart, correct, and were written in perfect English.\n\nThen it got interesting: Hazy started fixing bugs in the code itself. The\nfirst time this happened, I had assumed he’d made a mistake and pushed a wiki\nfile into the wrong folder. But I checked it out, and it was code, and his fix\nwas not only correct, but properly documented. Who knew that Hazy was a\nprogrammer, too?!\n\nI thanked him for the fix, and thought little more of it. But then the code\ncommits kept coming. Hazy was working his way through our Issues list, picking\noff bugs one after another that the dev team had been too busy to handle\nthemselves.\n\nToday, he is one of our best dev team members. I’ve still never met him, but\nafter a while I asked him a bit about himself.\n\nHis real name is Xiaojiang Huang. He lives in Beijing, and by day he is a PhD\nstudent in computer science at Peking University.\n\nHe told me his story:\n\n> When I was a kid, I was fascinated by all kinds of models, and I wished I\n> could have a RC plane. Several years later, I was able to afford a RC\n> helicopter when I graduated from college. I also got RC trucks and planes.\n> Sometimes, I am derided as naïve for playing with “toys,” but I’m happy\n> because it’s my childhood dream. I met ArduPilot by chance when I was\n> surfing the Web, and was attracted by its powerful functions. Some friends\n> of mine were also interested in it, but it felt a little inconvenient\n> because of the English documents. So I tried to translate them into Chinese,\n> hoping to reduce the difficulty of playing with ArduPilot for the Chinese\n> fans. Thank you for the great work of DIYDrones, and I hope it will help\n> more people make their dreams come true.\n\nWhat happened there is magical. When we first got word of the cloned boards,\nsome in our community initially jumped to the conclusion that this was another\ncase of blatant Chinese piracy and wanted to know when we were going to sue.\nBut by reminding them that this was not a “pirated” version, but instead a\n“derivative design” fully permitted and even encouraged by our open source\nlicense, the tenor changed.\n\nBy not demonizing the Chinese team, and instead treating them as part of the\ncommunity, they acted that way, too. Hazy stepped forward, and rather than\njust exploiting our work, he contributed to it, too.\n\nSo now the “pirates” work for us. Instead of just using our technology,\nthey’re working with us to improve the technology for everyone. \"Hazy”\nrealized his dreams, and in doing so helped us realize ours, too. That is the\npower of community.\n\nWe all have our different stories of community, and this was just one example\nof how great communities can touch every one of us. Building a community is a\ncomplex business, though. It involves careful planning and consideration, but\nalso the freedom to empower your community members to accomplish things that\nyou never dreamed of.\n\nI can’t think of a better guidebook than _The Art of Community_ and your\nfearless tour guide, Jono Bacon, for helping you navigate this journey. In the\nfirst edition of the book, Jono created a strong foundation of knowledge for\nbuilding and empowering communities. The second edition not only refines and\nextends this body of work, but also shares many other stories of how\nsuccessful communities have been created and the choices made in doing so.\nThis combination of Jono’s experience and insight as well as these real-world\nstories from other community leaders provides a strong pathway to success in\nyour own communities.\n\n—Chris AndersonEditor of _Wired Magazine_ , author of _The Long Tail_\n(Hyperion), creator of DIYDrones Berkeley, California November 15, 2011\n\n\n# Preface\n\n_Community_ is a funny ol’ word. In recent years our humble nine-letter friend\nhas come to mean many things to many people. No longer merely the domain of\ncharity groups and overtly friendly neighbors, community has gone on to be the\ntalk of technologists, businesspeople, politicians, students, welfare groups,\nand just about anyone who has connected to the Internet. Throughout this\nexplosive community lovefest, a minor detail has been omitted in all the\nexcitement: how on earth do we build an inspiring, engaging, and enjoyable\ncommunity in our own walk of life?\n\nToward the end of summer 2008 I received a phone call from Andy Oram, a well-\nrespected author and editor at O’Reilly. Although at the start of the call\nAndy was soliciting advice for building community in the educational world,\nthe call ended by sowing the seeds for _The Art of Community_.\n\nAndy’s interest in putting together this book was intriguing, but it could not\nhave come at a more complicated time. My days were hectic as the Ubuntu\ncommunity manager, leading my team to grow, refine, and optimize the global\nUbuntu community; I was in the midst of recording a solo metal album as part\nof a new Creative Commons project called Severed Fifth; I was coorganizing\nLugRadio Live 2008, recording and producing LugRadio shows every two weeks;\nand I was making plans to relocate to California. I had written three books\nbefore and I was intimately aware of just how incredibly time-consuming the\nprocess can be. Writing a book is like having a baby: it requires care and\nattention, and typically results in late nights, lack of sleep, and heartburn.\nConsequently, my best friend (who is also an author) and I had struck a no-\nmore-books pact.\n\nDespite all of this, I was intrigued. Community and the skills involved in\nmotivating, building, and inspiring it were rampantly undocumented, and much\nof my own skills had been developed through trial and error, exposing myself\nto different communities and observing how they worked. I was fortunate enough\nto have cut my teeth in community in some compelling environments, and I had\nalways wanted to write a book on the topic.\n\nFortunately none of these aforementioned challenges made any difference when I\ntalked it through with my best friend, Stuart. He and I have been discussing,\ndebating, and at times arguing about community since 1999, and he knows my\nviews, perspectives, drive, and ambitions about community better than anyone.\nWhat’s more, he had been wittering on about me writing something down about\ncommunity, despite our no-more-books pact. Ten minutes with that ginger ball\nof fury and my mind was made up: it was time to buy some antiheartburn pills\nand get some coffee in....\n\n# Documenting the Undocumented\n\nPart of my initial hesitation in writing a book on community was that I knew\nit was going to be a tough one to write. In my talks at conferences I often\nreferred to my role as “herding cats.” Much of the art of community is subtle,\nundocumented, and unwritten, and much of my own approach was largely the\nproduct of feeling my way around in the dark and learning from what I found. I\nknew that to write this book I would need to think carefully about not only\nhow to articulate these topics, but also how to handle the more complex\nchallenge of structuring this stream of consciousness into a consistent read\nthat, y’know, actually makes sense.\n\nWith this I wrote the first edition and I was proud of the results. The book\nbrought together many of the primary elements involved in building a\nproductive, collaborative community. To do this I distilled my own experiences\nand insight along with wisdom from others and illustrated these topics using a\nwealth of examples, stories, and anecdotes. The book started by taking a high-\nlevel view of how communities work at a social science level, and then delved\nstraight into topics such as strategic planning, communicating well, building\neffective and nonbureaucratic processes and infrastructure, creating buzz and\nexcitement, handling conflict and burnout, measuring community, creating and\nmanaging governance, organizing events, and even how to hire a community\nmanager.\n\n# The Second Edition\n\nWhen I released the first edition in 2009 I was terrified of how it would be\nreceived. The first edition presented a book about a topic that few other\nbooks had covered, was a challenge to structure in a logical way (community\nmanagement topics all intermingle like a spider web), and I wasn’t sure if I\nhad hit the right mark with the content. With a nervous twitch I watched it go\nto press.\n\nFortunately the book did well. It netted positive reviews and my original\nworries were alleviated. As the book started to spread I was delighted to see\nreader feedback, opinions, and ideas shared with me across the various social\nnetworks and over email. I continued to push and promote the book, and\nparticularly that the content could be shared freely, and it was wonderful to\nsee various communities and their leaders enjoying the book and finding the\ncontent empowering.\n\nOver the next few years I continued doing what I was doing; my Ubuntu\ncommunity management team grew, Severed Fifth started taking off, I started\ndoing the Shot Of Jaq podcast, and I got the Community Leadership Summit up\nand running. Across these various projects and spending time with the folks\ninvolved I continued to learn more and more about community management and\nleadership.\n\nAs time went on my pride of the first edition was increasingly augmented with\na list of things I wanted to add to it—exciting new approaches, ideas, and\ntopics that I had learned and developed that I wanted to share with the\nreaders who had been so generous in their feedback about the first edition. As\nsuch, I wrote to Andy Oram to suggest the idea of a second edition. As ever,\nAndy was supportive and I started putting together content for the book you\nhold here in your hand (or computer, tablet, or phone).\n\nFor this fully revised second edition, I have been through the entire text and\nadded various additional pieces of information, clarified certain points, and\nrefined and updated the content. I have also added a number of new big pieces\nof content. This includes three new chapters:\n\n[Chapter 6, Social Media](ch06.html \"Chapter 6. Social Media\")\n\n    \n\nWith the advent and popularity of social media this new chapter covers the\nmajor social media networks (Twitter, Facebook, and Google+) and the different\nstrategic and day-to-day approaches to harnessing social media for your\ncommunity.\n\n[Chapter 8, Measuring Community](ch08.html \"Chapter 8. Measuring Community\")\n\n    \n\nThis entirely new chapter presents approaches and techniques for tracking the\nwork your community or team commits to and methods of keeping this work on\ntrack. This is important in delivering value to your community, particularly\nwithin the context of volunteers working together effectively to deliver\nprojects.\n\n[Chapter 14, Community Case Book](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case Book\")\n\n    \n\nThis book is all about stories and using stories to share experiences and\nlessons to help you develop your skills as a community manager. This chapter\nprovides a collection of interviews with established community leaders such as\nLinus Torvalds (creator of Linux), Tim O’Reilly (founder of O’Reilly Media),\nMike Shinoda (cofounder of Linkin Park), Mary Colvig (community leader at\nMozilla), and many others. I hope you find these stories as inspiring as I\ndid.\n\nThere has also been a wealth of additional content draped throughout the\nexisting chapters. This includes:\n\n  * A discussion in [Chapter 2](ch02.html \"Chapter 2. Planning Your Community\") of methods for generating revenue to financially support your community\n\n  * Additions to [Chapter 7](ch07.html \"Chapter 7. Building Buzz\") for how to coordinate event attendance, create effective presentations, and deliver great talks\n\n  * A discussion in [Chapter 8](ch08.html \"Chapter 8. Measuring Community\") about how to react to community concerns in a structured and feedback-oriented way\n\n  * Several additional conflict and relationship scenarios in [Chapter 11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\") and how to handle them\n\n  * A significant addition to [Chapter 12](ch12.html \"Chapter 12. Creating and Running Events\") for how to create a community summit, using the Ubuntu Developer Summit as an outline\n\nOf course, there are many additional sidebars, clarifications, notes, and\nother pieces hidden throughout the book, too.\n\nWhile this edition provides a solid map for the road ahead, I am a firm\nbeliever that the road map will continue to expand and take on color and\ntexture through further editions. Community leadership is still very much a\nyoung science, and this book is still very much on that journey.\n\nWhere much of this insight will continue to grow is on the book’s website at\n<http://www.artofcommunityonline.org> and at the annual community leadership\nevent that I organize, the [Community Leadership\nSummit](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com). I would like to invite all\nof you good people to first enjoy _The Art of Community_ and to then provide\nyour own feedback, stories, and experiences to guide future editions.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> We’re always watching and learning, and iterating on our designs as the\n> community evolves so we can build a better and more enjoyable experience,\n> and everything we have learned will be applied to our future projects.\n>\n> —James Spafford, on Learning\n\nRead the [full interview](ch14.html#jamesspafford \"James Spafford, Media\nMolecule\") in [Chapter 14](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case Book\").\n\n# Who Is This Book For?\n\nThis book was written to be open and applicable to a wide range of\ncommunities. While O’Reilly is traditionally a computer book publisher, _The\nArt of Community_ is not specifically focused on computing communities, and\nthe vast majority of its content is useful for political groups, digital\nrights, knitting, and beyond.\n\nWithin this wide range of possible communities, this book will be useful for a\nrange of readers:\n\nProfessional community managers\n\n    \n\nIf you work in the area of community management professionally\n\nVolunteers and community leaders\n\n    \n\nIf you want to build a strong and vibrant community for your volunteer project\n\nCommercial organizations\n\n    \n\nIf you want to work with, interact with, or build a community around your\nproduct or service\n\nOpen source developers\n\n    \n\nIf you want to build a successful project, manage contributors, and build buzz\n\nMarketeers\n\n    \n\nIf you want to learn about viral marketing and building a following around a\nproduct or service\n\nActivists\n\n    \n\nIf you want to get people excited about your cause\n\nEvery chapter in this book is applicable to each of these roles. While\ntechnology communities provide many examples throughout the book,\nunderstanding these examples requires little technical knowledge.\n\n# The Road Ahead\n\nThroughout this book we are going to delve into the wide range of topics that\nface those of us who want to build and inspire great communities. Page after\npage we are going to weave an intricate web of the concepts, skills, and\napproaches involved in energizing a vibrant community and helping the members\nof that community to energize themselves.\n\nThis book is divided into 15 chapters, with each building on what went before.\nLet’s take a quick glance at the road ahead:\n\n[Chapter 1, The Art of Community](ch01.html \"Chapter 1. The Art of Community\")\n\n    \n\nWe begin the book with a bird’s-eye view of how communities function at a\nsocial science level. We cover the underlying nuts and bolts of how people\nform communities, what keeps them involved, and the basis and opportunities\nbehind these interactions.\n\n[Chapter 2, Planning Your Community](ch02.html \"Chapter 2. Planning Your\nCommunity\")\n\n    \n\nNext we carve out and document a blueprint and strategy for your community and\nits future growth. Part of this strategy includes the target objectives and\ngoals and how the community can be structured to achieve them.\n\n[Chapter 3, Communicating Clearly](ch03.html \"Chapter 3. Communicating\nClearly\")\n\n    \n\nAt the heart of community is communication, and great communicators can have a\ntremendously positive impact. Here we lay down the communications backbone and\nthe best practices associated with using it.\n\n[Chapter 4, Processes: Simple Is Sustainable](ch04.html \"Chapter 4. Processes:\nSimple Is Sustainable\")\n\n    \n\nWe then move on to focus on putting the facilities in place for your community\nto do great things. In this chapter we build simple, effective, and\nnonbureaucratic processes that enable your community to conduct tasks, work\ntogether, and share their successes.\n\n[Chapter 5, Supporting Workflow with Tools and Data](ch05.html\n\"Chapter 5. Supporting Workflow with Tools and Data\")\n\n    \n\nWe continue our discussion of community facilities to build workflows that are\ndriven by accessible, sensible, and rock-solid tools that enable your\ncontributors to do great work quickly and easily.\n\n[Chapter 6, Social Media](ch06.html \"Chapter 6. Social Media\")\n\n    \n\nWe now take a look at social networking, what it is, how it can help us, how\nto avoid the hype, and how to harness it in our communities.\n\n[Chapter 7, Building Buzz](ch07.html \"Chapter 7. Building Buzz\")\n\n    \n\nWith a solid foundation in place, we move on to build excitement and buzz\naround your community and encourage and enthuse every man and his dog to get\ninvolved and participate.\n\n[Chapter 8, Measuring Community](ch08.html \"Chapter 8. Measuring Community\")\n\n    \n\nAlthough many consider community touchy-feely and unmeasurable, this chapter\nconfronts the myth and guides you in tracking, monitoring, and otherwise\nmeasuring the work going on in the community so that it can be optimized and\nsimplified.\n\n[Chapter 9, Managing and Tracking Work](ch09.html \"Chapter 9. Managing and\nTracking Work\")\n\n    \n\nContinuing on from measuring our community, we now explore methods by which\nyou can ensure that your community projects and participants stay on track and\ndeliver great results.\n\n[Chapter 10, Governance](ch10.html \"Chapter 10. Governance\")\n\n    \n\nOur next stop is the wide-ranging and seemingly complex topic of governance.\nWe explore what options are available for a low-friction, capable, and\nrepresentative governance strategy for your community.\n\n[Chapter 11, Handling Conflict and Relationships](ch11.html\n\"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\")\n\n    \n\nOne of the most sensitive topics in community leadership is handling conflict.\nIn this chapter we explore how to identify, handle, and prevent irksome\nconflict; handle divisive personalities; and unblock problems.\n\n[Chapter 12, Creating and Running Events](ch12.html \"Chapter 12. Creating and\nRunning Events\")\n\n    \n\nEvents offer an excellent opportunity for your community to bond, be\nproductive, and have fun, and this is where we cast our beady eye in this\nchapter.\n\n[Chapter 13, Hiring a Community Manager](ch13.html \"Chapter 13. Hiring a\nCommunity Manager\")\n\n    \n\nWe now explore some advice and guidance for organizations that want to hire a\ncommunity manager to conduct and implement the wide range of topics that we\nhave discussed throughout the book.\n\n[Chapter 14, Community Case Book](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case Book\")\n\n    \n\nNext I present a fascinating collection of interviews from accomplished\ncommunity builders about how they created their own inspirational communities\nto help round off your knowledge with the experiences of these leaders.\n\n[Chapter 15, Onward and Upward](ch15.html \"Chapter 15. Onward and Upward\")\n\n    \n\nFinally, we close _The Art of Community_ with some additional resources and\nevents to continue your journey.\n\nEach of these broad topics is a piece in the jigsaw puzzle, a note in the\nsong, and a letter in the book. Step by step we will discuss these topics\nusing a liberal supply of stories, anecdotes, and examples to illuminate the\npath ahead. As we continue throughout the book, more and more of the road will\nbecome clear, and you will begin to develop your own approaches, patterns, and\nmethods of engaging your own community.\n\n# If You Like (or Don’t Like) This Book\n\nIf you like—or don’t like—this book, by all means, please let people know.\nAmazon reviews are one popular way to share your happiness (or lack of\nhappiness), or you can leave reviews at the site for the book:\n\n<http://oreil.ly/art_of_community_2e>  \n---  \n  \nThere’s also a link to errata there.

I appreciate every ounce of\nyour support!\n\nAll right, ’nuff chatting. Let’s get started....\n\n\n# Chapter 1. The Art of Community\n\n“Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought\ntogether.”\n\n—Vincent van Gogh\n\nAs my watch ticked over to 6 p.m., I knew I was in trouble. First of all, I\nwas late, and not fashionably late either. In fact, at the time, I was about\nas unfashionable as you could get for someone staring 18 down the barrel. Long\nhair, Iron Maiden t-shirt, baggy camouflage trousers, and a thumping-great\nleather jacket. I left my parents’ house and got into my small van, adorned\nwith oversized speakers and a tree-shaped air freshener. It was time to roll.\n\n“Rolling” was optimistic. Instead, I sat bumper-to-bumper in traffic with half\nof Southern England, all joined in curiosity about whether or not that film\nwith Michael Douglas could become a reality on this cold English day.\n\nThis wasn’t helping my nerves. As a fairly outgoing, angsty teen, nerves were\nnot usually my bag, but tonight, I was dining on them.\n\nYou see, tonight was different. Tonight I was doing something unusual,\nsomething that had seemed like a great idea…when I wasn’t running 30 minutes\nlate, hammering my way down the motorway, with my _Number of the Beast_\ncassette ritualistically sacrificed to the gods of hi-fi just for good\nmeasure.\n\nThankfully, the world’s longest mechanical conga line decided to crank it up a\nnotch. Before I knew it, I found myself on a street I had never been to, in a\ncity I had never been to, about to head into a room full of people I had never\nmet before, all united by one simple symbol…\n\nA penguin.\n\nAn hour before, that penguin had seemed so inviting and friendly. It was a\nsymbol that encompassed everything about the movement it represented, a\nmovement that came together in spirit and mind to build a system that drove a\nnew generation of technology and freedom…a movement that celebrated this drive\nby forming user groups in unknown streets, in unknown cities, and with unknown\npeople.\n\nBut as I stood there, doorbell already pressed, none of that was even close to\nmy conscious thoughts. Instead, the brain of one Jonathan E. J. Bacon was\nbattening down the hatches, preparing for ultimate, unparalleled discomfort as\nI walked into a place I both did and didn’t want to be at the same time.\n\nThen the door opened and a rather nice chap called Neil welcomed me into his\nhome.\n\nCommunity is a funny beast. Most people—the kind who watch talent shows on\ntelevision and occasionally dip bread in oil in an expensive restaurant—don’t\nunderstand people like Neil. Why on earth would this guy decide to open his\nhome, free of charge, to a collection of strangers who met on the Internet?\nWhy would he want to spend an evening drinking tea and making jokes about\nsomething called “Emacs”? And why would he fund online resources like fliers,\na mailing list, and a website from his own pocket; start a book-lending\nservice for the group—and even shell out for tea and biscuits?\n\nOne person who really didn’t seem to understand was Neil’s wife. Somewhat\nbemused, and referring to us as his “Internet friends,” Neil’s significant\nother decided tonight was the night for visiting a long-lost (or possibly\nignored) relative, rather than sticking around and faking interest.\n\n# Collaboration-Driven Ethos\n\nBut Neil is not unusual. At least, not in the Open Source, Free Software,\nLibre, and Free Culture world. There are many Neils all over the globe,\norganizing groups, setting up mailing lists, scheduling meetings, and coming\ntogether to share an _ethos_ : the combined set of beliefs, customs, and\nsentiment that flows between like-minded people.\n\nIn the past 10 to 15 years, we have seen Free Culture in technology, art, and\nthe media explode into our consciousness. The entire machine is driven by\npeople like Neil; people who volunteer themselves to the concepts of community\nand togetherness wrapped around such an ethos.\n\nThere are Neils outside the Free Culture world, too. They’re in church groups,\nhelping the poor and unfortunate; in Neighborhood Watch and Meals on Wheels\ncampaigns, reaching out to those around them; and in public art installations,\npolitical groups, and craft fairs. They volunteer, perform, and share their\nopinions and creativity on anything from aerobics to knitting to yoga.\n\nWhat intrigued me when I first walked into Neil’s living room was the concept\nof a _collaboration-driven ethos_ , although at the time I had no idea what\nthose words meant. What that experience taught, and what that evening inspired\nin me, was an excitement about what is possible when you get a group of people\ntogether who share a common ethos and a commitment to furthering it.\n\nIn my world, that ethos has thus far been Free Culture, Free Software, digital\nrights, and breaking down the digital divide, but it can be as critical as\ncreating world peace or as fanciful as sharing photos of kittens playing\nguitars on the Internet. The importance of community is not in the crusade,\nbut in how you unify people to march forward together, side by side.\n\nAt its heart, _The Art of Community_ is a distilled set of approaches and\nthoughts about how to build community. The book is a collection of\nexperiences, observations, and thoughts from my career and elsewhere. My aim\nis to bring this grab bag of concepts and curiosities together into one\nconsistent text.\n\nHowever, it is important that we keep the book in perspective in the wider\nscheme of your growth as a community leader and organizer. You should mentally\nframe the content here as a foundation for your own ideas, but remember that\npractical experience is the real magic that we want to create, with theory\nmerely the glittery jacket and spinning bow tie.\n\nCommunity is fundamentally a _soft science_. Compare it with, for example,\nprogramming. If you want to write a computer software application, you write\nit in a programming language. These synthetic languages are vessels of logic.\nThey live and breathe in a world where the answer to a question is either\n_yes_ or _no_ ; there is no _maybe_. In a world where _maybe_ does not exist,\nyou can plan ahead for an answer. With community, the importance and diversity\nof the question is equally essential.\n\nMapping Out the Journey\n\nIn this chapter we are going to be exploring the big-picture attributes that\nare present in every community. As such, this chapter is filled with a lot of\nhigh-level theory that’s important to our journey.\n\nIt may be tempting to steam ahead and dig into the hands-on content in later\nchapters, but it is recommended that you read and understand all of the\nconcepts in this chapter first.\n\nThis chapter was designed for tea and snacks. Go and grab some, curl up in a\nchair, and get ready to explore the social schematics of your community.\n\n# The Essence of Community\n\nOn February 26, 2004, three friends and I released the first episode of a new\naudio show called [LugRadio](http://www.lugradio.org/). Although LugRadio will\nbe featured extensively in this book as a source of stories, all you really\nneed to know about it right now is that (a) it was a loose and fun audio show\n(a podcast) about open source and free culture, (b) on that day it was\nentirely new, and (c) we had absolutely no idea what on earth we were doing.\nRadio personalities across the world were not exactly shaking in their boots.\n\nRecorded in a very small room that I called a studio, but was actually a\nbedroom filled with secondhand recording equipment, LugRadio involved my three\ncompadres and me opining into four precariously balanced microphones that fed\ninto a computer. Episode 1 was around half an hour long, composed of bad jokes\nand a book review, and totally unpolished. At the time, it was just new and\ndifferent. Little did we know that four years later we would wrap up the show\nhaving achieved over 2 million downloads. Anyway, enough of the self-\ncongratulatory back-patting and back to the story....\n\nWith the show out, we did what many of us in the open source world do—we set\nup forums, wikis, and channels, and tried to get people together around our\nnew project. The forums went online first, and people started joining.\n\nThe 22nd member was a guy called Ben Thorp, known as mrben on the forums. An\nEnglishman living in Scotland, mrben was an open source enthusiast who\nstumbled onto the forums, listened to the show, and liked what he heard. For\nthe four years that LugRadio lasted, mrben was there every single day: in\ntotal contributing over 3,000 posts; involving himself in the chat channel,\nthe wiki, and the organization of the live events; running an episode download\nmirror; and much more. Mrben was there every step of the way, loving every\nsecond of it.\n\nThe first question is, Why? Why does a 30-something Engli-Scot decide to\nimmerse himself so deeply in a group of people he has never met before? What\nis it that makes him want to spend time away from his friends and family to\ncontribute to a radio show performed by four strangers in a different country?\nWhy would he want to contribute to something with seemingly no financial,\ncareer, or other conventional benefit to him?\n\nA cynic could argue that mrben is some kind of socially challenged nerd who\ncan only communicate with other similarly socially inept nerds. Conventional\nwisdom sometimes argues that anyone who freely contributes his time to\nsomething that could not benefit him financially is weird. This was clearly\nnot the case with Ben. He had a job, a wife, and a child. He went to church\nregularly. When I had the pleasure of socializing with him, I found him a fun,\nsmart, and entertaining part of the group. In fact, at two of the live events,\nhe was a guest in my home. Social deviation was clearly not the answer, or if\nit was, he hid it well.\n\nThe reason why Ben was so involved in LugRadio, why Neil ran the Linux User\nGroup meeting, and why thousands of other community members around the world\nget together, comes down to one simple word: _belonging_.\n\nBy definition, a community is a collection of people (or animals) who interact\nwith one another in the same environment. Community exists everywhere in\nnature. From people to penguins, from monkeys to meerkats, the vast majority\nof organisms exhibit some form of collective grouping. Grouping, however, is a\ntouch simplistic as a means to describe community. It is not merely the group\nthat generates community, but the interactions within it. These interactions,\nand the feeling of belonging that they produce, are generated from a\ndistinctive kind of economy: a _social economy_.\n\n## Building Belonging into the Social Economy\n\nAt this point in our journey, it is clear that _belonging_ is our goal. It is\nthat nine-letter word that you should write out in large letters and stick on\nyour office wall. It is that word that should be at the forefront of your\ninspiration behind building strong community. If there is no belonging, there\nis no community.\n\nFrom the outset, though, belonging is an abstract concept. We all seemingly\nunderstand it, but many of us struggle to describe it in words. I identify\nbelonging pragmatically: as the positive outcome of a positive social economy.\nIn the same way that we judge a strong financial economy by prosperity,\nwealth, and a quality standard of living, belonging is the reward of a strong\nsocial economy.\n\nAn economy is a set of shared concepts and processes that grow and change in\nan effort to generate a form of capital. In a financial economy, participants\nput goods and services on the market to generate financial capital. The\nprocesses and techniques they use include measuring sales, strategic\nmarketing, enabling ease of access, and so forth. A social economy is the same\nthing—but _we_ are the product, and the capital is respect and trust. The\nprocesses and techniques here are different—open communication mediums, easy\naccess to tools, and so on—but the basic principles are the same.\n\nOpen Source in the Economy\n\nStephen Walli, a prominent commentator on open source in business and review\neditor for _The Art of Community_ , drew some interesting connections between\nthe underlying concepts in a financial economy and how they apply to the open\nsource social economy. He presented these thoughts in his piece titled [“Free\nand Open Source Software Developers Working for Free (Economics\n101)”](http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2007/09/free-and-open-1.html):\n\n> People value their skill sets differently in different contexts, but value\n> them they do. I use writers as an example to explain this to nondevelopers:\n> a technical or marcomm writer may spend 8 hours a day at their paid job,\n> then spend their evenings and weekends teaching ESL classes at the local\n> college, working on a newsletter for their local\n> church/synagogue/neighborhood organization, helping a child with a school\n> project, and writing a sonnet to their significant other (or the next great\n> novel or screenplay). In every case they’re using their writing skills;\n> they’re just valuing them differently in different contexts.\n>\n> There’s another way to look at it. Not every market involves exchanging\n> money for goods and services. A gem of an economics book (_Reinventing the\n> Bazaar_ by John McMillan, 2002, p. 135) points out that well-designed\n> markets, regardless of market type, have a number of things in common:\n>\n>   * Information flows smoothly.\n>\n>   * People can be trusted to live up to their promises.\n>\n>   * Competition is fostered.\n>\n>   * Property rights are protected, but not overprotected.\n>\n>   * Damaging side effects on third parties are curtailed.\n>\n>\n\n>\n> Let’s look at well-run free and open source project communities in terms of\n> such market dynamics:\n>\n>   * Information flows smoothly—transparency of community, process, code,\n> policy, bugs, discussions.\n>\n>   * People can be trusted to live up to their promises—the project’s license\n> is a social contract. Its governance culture is well understood and\n> supported.\n>\n>   * Competition is fostered—what fixes and features are accepted, and which\n> ones don’t make it.\n>\n>   * Property rights are protected, but not overprotected—code copyright\n> management and licensing is handled properly in well-run projects.\n>\n>   * Damaging side effects on third parties are curtailed—the point here from\n> the book is that WHEN real damage might be done to third parties, there are\n> ways governments can involve themselves in the market to curtail such\n> effects, whether by defining/enforcing property rights, taxes/incentives, or\n> policy/regulation. The community’s license comes to mind.\n>\n>\n\n>\n> Individual projects behave as markets from one perspective, and code is\n> currency, the medium of exchange. Just like all economic exchanges, the\n> contributor offers something they value less (a fragment of code solving a\n> particular need) for something they value more (the functioning software\n> package in its entirety). Nobody is working for free in an economic sense.\n\nSocial capital is known by us all, but we know it by many different words:\n_kudos_ , _respect_ , _goodwill_ , _trust_ , _celebrity_ , _influence_ ,\n_supremacy_ , _greatness_ , and _leverage_ , to name a few.\n\nThe first known use of the term _social capital_ (referred to in Robert\nPutnam’s _Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community_\n[Simon & Schuster]) was by L. J. Hanifan, a school supervisor in rural\nVirginia. Hanifan described social capital as “those tangible substances\n[that] count for most in the daily lives of people: namely goodwill,\nfellowship, sympathy, and social intercourse among the individuals and\nfamilies who make up a social unit....”\n\nSocial capital is the collective family of positive interactions between two\nor more people. When you affect someone positively (this could include being\ngenerous, helping someone, sympathizing over a problem, or something else), it\nhas ripple effects on the community you and he are a part of. In addition to\ncreating goodwill for you (increasing your own social capital), it strengthens\nthe other person and the community in ways that ultimately benefit your social\ncapital, too. Hanifan identifies the opportunity behind social capital:\n\n> The individual is helpless socially, if left to himself…If he comes into\n> contact with his neighbor, and they with other neighbors, there will be an\n> accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social\n> needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial\n> improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a\n> whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual\n> will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and\n> the fellowship of his neighbors.\n\nThe meat in Hanifan’s description is the opportunity for social capital to\n“bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of\nliving conditions in the whole community.” In essence, if a member of your\ncommunity has a positive approach to another member, her social capital grows,\nwhich has a positive impact on that person and the community as a whole. It\nall sounds a lot like karma, and it is.\n\nOf course, capital, whether monetary or social, is not the end game. People\ndon’t make money for the purposes of just having money. They make money\nbecause it allows them to do other things.\n\nThis is an important aspect of understanding where an economy starts and ends.\nMost folks riding the financial economy are not purely greedy numbers freaks\nwho just want a big pot of money; most people who work with social capital are\nnot merely air-kissing, hand-waving, superficial animals who simply want to\nname-drop and be name-dropped in the interests of social acceptance. Of\ncourse, the greedy and the socially obsessed do exist, but it is important not\nto use them as a basis for judgment. The economy is not flawed; those people\nare flawed.\n\nA final point: for an economy to work, every participant needs to _believe in\nthe economy_. Belief is a critical component in how any group of people or\nanimals functions. This can be belief in God, belief in values, or belief in a\nnew future. Whatever the core belief is, the economy and the community can be\nsuccessful only if everyone has faith in it.\n\nSo let’s have a quick recap:\n\n  * A sense of belonging is what keeps people in communities. This belonging is the goal of community building. The hallmark of a strong community is when its members feel that they belong.\n\n  * Belonging is the measure of a strong social economy. This economy’s currency is not the money that you find in your wallet or down the back of your couch, but is _social capital_.\n\n  * For an economy and community to be successful, the participants need to believe in it. If no one believes in the community that brings them together, it fails.\n\n  * Like any other economy, a social economy is a collection of processes that describe how something works and is shared among those who participate.\n\n  * These processes, and the generation of social capital, which in turn generates belonging, need to be effectively communicated.\n\nSo far, we have talked extensively about our goals (belonging), the medium of\nexchange (social capital), and what is at the heart of an economy (processes).\nWe now need to focus on the final component that binds each of these concepts\ntogether: communication.\n\nIn many ways, an economy is like a flowing river: it never stops, and the flow\nis critical to its success. Economies never stand still. Every day they\nchange, adjusting to stimuli in the world that affects them. At the heart of\nhow this movement works is _communication_.\n\n# The Basis of Communication\n\nPeter Bloch, a consultant on learning, makes an important foundational\nobservation about communication in a social economy: “Community is\nfundamentally an interdependent human system given form by the conversation it\nholds with itself.” When I first heard that quote, I realized that the\nmechanism behind communication in a community is _stories_.\n\nStories are a medium in which we keep the river flowing. They are the vessels\nnot only in which we express ideas (“I was taking the subway to work one day,\nand I saw this lady on there reading the paper, and it made me think xyz”),\nbut also in how we learn from past experiences (“There was one time when I saw\nDavid do xyz and I knew I had to adjust how I myself handle those situations\nin the future”). Furthermore, when the characters in the stories are people in\na community, the stories are self-referencing and give the community a sense\nof reporting. Communities really feel like communities when there is a\nnewswire, be it formalized or through the grapevine.\n\nNot all stories are cut from the same cloth, though. Communities tend to\nexchange two very different kinds of story: _tales_ and _fables_.\n\nTales are told for entertainment value and to share experiences. They are\nindividual units of experience that are shared between people, and their\nprimary value is in communicating a given person’s experience and adding to\nthe listener’s repertoire of stories and experiences.\n\nFables are different. Fables are stories designed to illustrate an underlying\nmessage. The vast majority of us are exposed to fables as children, and these\nstories are passed down from generation to generation, each one extolling a\nmoral message to the youth of the day.\n\nLet us now take a step back to our earlier story about mrben joining the\nLugRadio community. This story was itself a tale that shared an experience\nthat encased many of the concepts we have explored.\n\nWhen mrben joined the LugRadio community he identified with the ethos of the\nshow. Then he began to engage with stories—first hearing them on the show\nitself, then getting them from the community, and finally sharing them\nhimself. As mrben contributed more and more, his social capital started to\nrise—the community had a lot of respect for him and his opinions. He, in turn,\nbelieved in the community and in his own abilities. This objectivity in his\nstorytelling and his general demeanor contributed to his social capital. As he\ncontinued to be a part of the community, his sense of belonging developed. At\nthis point, mrben was living and breathing LugRadio, its community, and its\nethos.\n\nThe result of this process is a community member with a strong sense of\nloyalty. Some of the greatest examples of belonging and commitment to an ethos\noccur when the community is threatened. An interesting example of this was\nwhen we released Season 5, Episode 3 of the show and received a rather angry\nstatement from a listener who was clearly agitated at the level of expertise\non the show and the generally positive attitude toward Ubuntu (which all of\nthe presenters expressed):\n\n> Nowadays I mostly stick to Dave Yates at lottalinuxlinks who is a genuine\n> Linux obsessive, Chess Griffin at linuxreality who maybe does stuff for\n> noobs but is genuinely knowledgeable about Linux, and the guys at the\n> linuxlinktechshow because they work with Linux and know what the fuck\n> they’re talking about.\n\nMrben, who had spent a few years in the community by then, responded to the\ncriticism using stories to make his point:\n\n> I think you’ll find that all of the presenters on LugRadio work with Linux\n> on a daily basis. Whether or not they know wtf they’re talking about is, of\n> course, a matter of opinion. But the addition of Chris and Adam to the team,\n> both of whom (IIRC) are professional Linux sysadmins, is an influx of\n> knowledge on that side of things. Jono has a long history of working with\n> Open Source and Linux within the community (bingo!) even if his technical\n> knowledge is not at the same level. Aq is a Free software zealot, but is\n> also experienced in web development and usability. I still think it’s a good\n> mix, personally.\n>\n> The Ubuntu thing is an issue, admittedly. But then, LugRadio still reflects\n> my experience of LUGs—the majority of people are talking about Ubuntu. It\n> has become the mainstream desktop distro, and the benchmark that most people\n> mark other distros against. But, IMHO, the recent shows haven’t shown an\n> overly Ubuntu slant. Look at this show—you’ve got an interview with Quim\n> Gil, which is about Maemo, not Ubuntu, the finger of God, which is plain\n> silliness, the software vendors and security issue, which applies across the\n> board, and packaging, which was fairly Ubuntu specific, but could easily\n> relate across to other Debian-based distros, and, as Chris said, he would’ve\n> talked about RPM if it had been possible.\n>\n> The “Ubuntu slant” is more about personal usage and experience, rather than\n> a change in the show’s direction (which was unashamedly Debian slanted\n> before Ubuntu came out....)\n\nIn his three-paragraph response, mrben referred to 12 distinctive points and\nfacts, citing many from existing online material. His response sought not only\nto convince the original poster of his error, but also to demonstrate to the\ncommunity that the poster was wrong, thus providing a sense of security. By\nusing objective facts, he also spoke with the voice of the community, not just\nhis own opinion. Mrben’s response was driven by belief in the community,\nformed by familiarity with stories, and legitimized by a wealth of social\ncapital. Subtle, yet inspiring.\n\nAlthough the underlying social economy infrastructure in community is\ncompelling, it is important to remember that it is merely a structure designed\nto deliver a far more exhilarating prospect— _opportunity_. And with that,\nlet’s spin back in time....\n\n# Unwrapping Opportunity\n\nWhen I first learned about Linux I was running a small bookshop in Milton\nKeynes, in Southern England, and living at home, having taken a year off\nbefore starting university. When Simon, the elder of my two siblings, stayed\nin our house for a few weeks on his return from the United States, we\nfrequently spent the evenings talking about computers and stand-up comedy.\n\nOn one of those evenings, while I was hurling abuse at my computer, Simon\nexpressed surprise that I used a “Mickey Mouse operating system.” I was\nsurprised myself. As far as I knew, Windows—Windows 98, at that—was all that\nexisted. Simon told me about something called “Linux,” which I could get for\nfree from the back of a book.\n\nArmed with my 10% discount, I eagerly snagged a copy of _Slackware Linux\nUnleashed_ , and Simon set to installing Slackware 96 on my desktop computer.\nTwo weeks later, having used guile, cunning, and a soldering iron (literally),\nand maintaining the alignment of the planets, I actually got the thing to\nboot. As I gazed eagerly at the screen, ready to experience the next\ngeneration of operating system technology, I was confronted with:\n\n    \n    \n    darkstar login:\n\nIt was not exactly _Minority Report_.\n\nSimon, being the kind and sharing brother he was, wrote the username and\npassword down on a piece of paper, stuck it to my screen, and promptly sodded\noff. The following day he moved out. I was left with a login prompt, some\nnerves, and absolutely no idea of what to do. So I cracked open the book,\nthrew on a Testament album, and started reading.\n\nIt was then that I read about the Free Software community: a worldwide\ncollection of enthusiasts all connected by the Internet, sharing an ethos that\nsoftware should be free while building a replacement to the Microsoft behemoth\nthat frustrated so many. Piece by piece, this global army provided software\nalternatives, many of which improved on their commercial counterparts. Back\nthen, Linux was in the dark ages of computing. It was all command-line-driven,\ndevices rarely worked, and to do anything you needed to compile code. Still,\nthis concept of a worldwide community sharing code absolutely fascinated me.\nThis is when I first smelled the sweet aroma of _opportunity_.\n\nAlthough the reality of open source in 1998 was primitive, the potential\nwithin the community is what inspired me to stick with it. To be honest, I was\npretty perturbed by the sheer complexity of it all. In those days it was\ninsanely complicated to get a system up and running, and the innards of the\noperating system were on display for all to see. (These days, as Uncyclopedia\n[<http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/>] so eloquently puts it, “Linux distros are\nso idiot-proof that you can put their install CDs into the floppy drive\nupside-down and it will still work” [slightly edited for a family audience].)\nBack then, we all knew that life with Linux was a lot harder than it needed to\nbe, but the strong sense of underlying opportunity helped spark the\nimagination to put up with that complexity for the potential of a better\nfuture.\n\nThere is an important connection here in which _imagination_ and _opportunity_\nare close friends. Imagination offers the mind a vision of how things could\nbe. If there is a viable path toward this future, we build a sense of\nopportunity. If there is no viable path, we enter the world of fantasy.\n\nLinux, and the possibility of it becoming a prominent operating system, was by\nno means a fantasy. The rails were on the ground. The community just needed\nfreely available tools and communication channels to gather the materials,\nbuild the train, and put it on the track. In the case of Linux, this\nmanifested in three primary areas:\n\nOpen communication\n\n    \n\nWith an open community and publicly visible and accessible communication\nchannels, anyone can join the community and meet hundreds of thousands of\nother community members just like them.\n\nLicensing of work\n\n    \n\nEvery contribution to the Linux community is licensed in such a way that it\nbenefits the entire community. The fair licensing of all contributions adds a\nstrong sense of confidence to the security of the community.\n\nOpen tools\n\n    \n\nAnyone with an Internet connection and a computer can contribute. All of the\ndevelopment tools and documentation are entirely free and open to access. This\nprovides a low barrier to entry, and lets new users play with the technology.\n\nAlthough these elements were essential at the birth of Linux, it is not open\ncommunication, licensing, and tools that generate _opportunity_. These\nelements merely made it possible to build a world-class Free Software\noperating system. Opportunity is born in a sense of _belief_.\n\nBelief is a critically important human function. Whether your belief is in an\nall-creating god, in a family member’s ability to achieve something for\nherself, in a better future in your neighborhood, or in the reliability of a\nrestaurant guide, belief is what gives us hope for the world around us. Belief\ncan also make human beings surprisingly resilient in intensely difficult and\nuncomfortable situations.\n\nOne example of this is an incident that occurred a few years back. Every year,\nas part of LugRadio, we hosted a face-to-face get-together called [LugRadio\nLive](http://www.lugradio.org/live/), which is a very different style of\nconference. We had worked hard to deliberately make the conference\nfundamentally a community event. Equality between commercial vendors and the\ncommunity was a key attribute, and we deliberately set a low cover charge to\nkeep it accessible. In addition to this, we worked to produce a very informal\nand inclusive atmosphere, inspired largely by music events. (Many referred to\nLugRadio Live as a “rock conference.”)\n\nLugRadio Live has carved out something of a reputation for being different,\nand each of its participants has been very keen about advocating it and its\nformula. There was a strong sense of belief in the event—an event that was\ndistinctively community-oriented and -driven, open to participation, and\navailable to all.\n\nWith LugRadio Live scheduled for July 22–23, 2006, everything was going to\nplan. The speakers and exhibitors were sourced, the schedule was in place, the\nsocial events were arranged, and the crew and community were ready. Everything\nwas great until the evening of July 18, when I received news of an impending\nrail strike. The strike was planned for the full weekend of the event, with\nevery rail link going down. The country would be completely inaccessible by\ntrain.\n\nI had never experienced such anger and frustration. For about an hour, I\ntransformed into an ultraconservative right-wing anti-union crazy, and I\nstomped around the house, venting in the direction of my computer screen. We\nhad spent six months of feverish planning and hard work, and this union\ndecided that their problems were more important than anyone else’s, and it was\nentirely reasonable to take the country down. I, for one, was not a happy\nbunny.\n\nBut, as my fellow organizers and I seethed on the phone, the community was\nalready doing its thing. Forum threads appeared instantly to keep people up-\nto-date on the strike, blog entries were drafted, a nationwide car-sharing\nscheme kicked into play, and speakers and exhibitors were notified. While all\nof this was going on, I was on the phone tearing a strip out of both the union\nand the rail organization for their decision. Fortunately, the strike was\ncalled off a few days later.\n\nWhat stunned me was just how mobilized the LugRadio community was. The\ncommunity saw a threat to something they felt invested in, and reacted as a\nteam to cover all the bases and try to limit the damage. Without any prodding\nfrom us, they made things happen. In a time of such panic and frustration,\nthat community wrapped around each organizer like a comfort blanket. It was\none of the most inspiring examples I have ever seen of a community coming\ntogether, driven by a belief in something we all shared.\n\nWhere belief gets exciting is when it is combined with that friend of ours\nfrom a few pages back: opportunity. Belief in a shared crusade—and a sense\nthat the tools and opportunities are available to achieve that goal—is an\nintensely liberating feeling. People get a sense that they have control over\ntheir own destiny.\n\nAn example of this was the election of Barack Obama as President of the United\nStates. Building up to his victory, the US was facing difficult times. Led by\na president who many lacked faith in, and faced with a global economic crisis\nand a complex set of foreign affairs, the US had a lot to deal with, including\na growing sense of cynicism among its people. Many Americans had lost faith in\npolitics and pride in their country. As Barack Obama stepped up as a candidate\nfor the presidential election, he instilled a sense of belief and opportunity\nthat inspired his followers.\n\nWhen people feel that they can achieve a dream, it builds an incredible sense\nof liberation and a willingness to step up to the plate. People become very\ncommitted, very quickly. We saw this in droves throughout the presidential\nelection. Thousands of people across the country took to the streets to tell\nthe world about Obama.\n\nAround that time I had kissed chilly England goodbye and relocated to sunny\nCalifornia. The Bay Area was a particularly fascinating place to be—people\nsetting up tables, selling stickers, knocking on doors, and making phone\ncalls. It seemed that one in three people on the street was wearing an Obama\nt-shirt.\n\nWhether Obama was the right man for the job is the topic of a thousand other\nbooks, but he had the ability to define belief, opportunity, and liberation in\na language that a nation could understand. His inspiration—and his army of\npassionate Obamaniacs—sealed his place in the Oval Office. This in itself was\nan incredible exercise in building, energizing, and inspiring community, and\nregardless of your political inclination, it was a stunning feat.\n\n# A Community Manager: Becoming the Community\n\nSo far, we have explored some of the high-level concepts and architecture\nbehind community and how it is structured. It is these concepts, such as\nsocial economy, belonging, belief, social capital, and communication, that\nhelp to draw the outline of the picture. We will use the rest of the book to\ncolor in the details.\n\nBefore we move on, though, we should spend some time profiling the artist\nholding this palette of colors. What are the skills required to draw the\npicture? What attributes will help us put the right colors in the right\nplaces? What do you need to build a really great community?\n\nMetaphor aside, community building is a genuine art form. Like any art, there\nare attributes and characteristics that define someone as an artist, but every\nartist has his own “special sauce” that makes him unique and different. Every\none of you lucky enough to have your nose buried in this book will have yours.\nAlthough I talk about some common characteristics all community managers\nshould have, always strive to find your own approach.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> If you work hard to improve your craft, and care deeply about the integrity\n> of your art, I think you have a good shot. I believe if you make something\n> good, success will follow.\n>\n> —Mike Shinoda, on Success\n\nRead the [full interview](ch14.html#mikeshinoda \"Mike Shinoda, Linkin Park\")\nin [Chapter 14](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case Book\").\n\n## Cracking Open the Personality\n\nWhen exploring the mind of a community manager, we can break the attributes\nyou need into two broad areas: _personality_ and _strategic traits_. The\nlatter, strategic traits, are skills, perspectives, and abilities that help\nyou to organize complex problems into logical boxes, develop action points and\na plan, and implement those intentions in a controlled way. Strategy is a\nlarge and complex subject, and we will discuss it extensively in the next\nchapter. As such, I will defer exploration of this part of the community\nmanager’s brain until later. For now, let’s talk about personality.\n\nMy wife and I often joke about how I respond when someone asks me what I do\nfor a living. I used to describe my job as “managing a worldwide community of\nvolunteers,” which sounded rather accurate and complete to me. My wife was\nless impressed. She rightly nudged me and suggested that made it sound like I\nmanage a large online forum of very weird Japanese animation fans with a\nworrying obsession with tentacles. From that discussion onward, I have tried\nto summarize in one sentence what it is that we community managers do. The\nbest I have come up with is:\n\nI help to enable a worldwide collection of volunteers to work together to do\nthings that make a difference to them.  \n---  \n  \nI know, it needs work. Send better suggestions to the usual address....\n\nTwenty of those 21 words are really just filler around the word that I _truly_\nthink describes what we do: _enable_.\n\nOur function as community leaders is to enable people to be the best they can\nbe in the community they have chosen to be a part of. Our job is to help our\ncommunity members achieve their greatest ambitions, and to help them work with\nother members to realize not only their own personal goals, but also the goals\nof the community itself.\n\n## Trust Is Everything\n\nAt the heart of this enablement is _trust_. As we have already discussed,\ncommunity is fundamentally a social economy, and its participants build up\nsocial capital via their contributions. With social capital being, by its very\nnature, a product of social interaction, trust is critical. If people in a\ncommunity don’t trust you, you will be met with caution and you will struggle\nto build your social capital.\n\nFor community leaders and managers, trust is a critical component in gaining\nthe support and confidence of your community members. Earlier, we explored the\nexample of Barack Obama stepping forward to enthuse a nation in turbulent\ntimes. Part of the reason why those times were turbulent was a significant\nlack of trust in President George W. Bush. When trust vanishes, words and\npromises lose their meaning. When trust is present, words and promises\nflourish in a world where they have purpose and potential.\n\nTrust, though, is not something you can learn. Either you are trusted or you\nare not. As my father-in-law said to my family one evening over dinner, “Live\nyour life honestly—if you don’t, you always have to remember to not be\nyourself.” His words teach an important lesson: when trust is implicit in\nevery step you take, you can always be confident in the transparency and\nopenness of your actions. This is the most important aspect of community\nleadership, and of life itself.\n\nPart of the reason why trust is so critical is that, as a community leader,\nyou want to be emotionally close to everyone in your community. You want\neveryone in that community to think of you as an accessible, approachable,\nsensitive person, and trust is required for any of these roles. People will\napproach you for advice, for guidance, to discuss personal issues, to handle\nconflict, and more. Many of these situations will be complex, and will require\na significant level of sensitivity and confidence.\n\n## The Value of Listening\n\nPart of achieving that sense of trust and confidence is having a firm\nfoundation of understanding and patience. You should be aware right now that\nsome people are going to frustrate you. Some people will be too quick to act\nand opine on a subject, and some will be too timid and reluctant to put their\nhands up. Some people will obsess about the wrong things and regularly produce\nwhat appears to be a tempest in a teacup.\n\nBut then again, some people will inspire you with their sense of\nresponsibility, their ability to react to situations with grace and elegance,\nand their willingness to care for the community. As a community leader you\nwill experience all sides of human nature, from strength and innovation to\nweakness and uncertainty. Whatever you hear from your community, you should\nendeavor to be the best _listener_ that you can.\n\nWhen you can demonstrate trust and the ability to listen, your community will\ndevelop respect for you. They will be there to listen to you, to work with\nyou, to stand side-by-side with you in your battles and become a large\nextended family that you can rely on.\n\nThis respect has an important function in reinforcing belief in your\ncommunity. When community members have responsive positive interactions with\ncommunity leaders, it makes the community feel more inclusive, which generates\nbelief and, importantly, belonging.\n\nRespect is a wonderful gift, and you should cherish it and protect it at all\ncosts. Getting that respect back after you lose it is a near-impossible task.\n\n## Avoid Ego, or Others Will Avoid You\n\nJust as the right kind of inspiration can cause lasting effects, wrong\ndecisions and approaches can cause lasting damage.\n\nThe biggest risk that can face any community leader is _excessive ego_.\nUnfortunately, ego is something that plagues a lot of people who assume a form\nof leadership.\n\nOne rather fun side effect of an influential position is _fame_ ; people know\nwho you are, they read your words, and they listen to your opinions. The\ngrowth of the Internet and online communities has made it easier than ever to\nbolster your ego. Google searches, social networking websites, news feeds,\nalerts, statistics tracking, and more make it easier than ever to find out how\nmany people love (or loathe) you. While this may seem incredibly flattering at\ntimes, strive to put your audience in perspective. The world is a big place,\nand you have some incredible contributions to add to it, but you should always\naim to strike a balance between valuing your contributions and disappearing up\nyour own arse.\n\nUnfortunately, I have seen ego claim too many victims. I have seen community\nleaders who have commanded incredible respect and adoration from their legions\nof fans, but have washed it away when they assume a sense of _entitlement_. In\nany community, entitlement is an enemy: it values the person over the\ncontribution, creating unrealistic expectations about how people should be\ntreated. People with this sense of entitlement typically identify the wider\ncontributions of the community, but see their fame as a red carpet that others\ndon’t have access to. You can avoid the wrath of ego by always remembering\nthat in your role as a community leader you are responsible _to_ the team, not\n_for_ the team.\n\nOne such example of this was a guy (who shall remain nameless) who got very\ninvolved in a large open source project. Although not a developer, he became a\nvery public face in the project. He talked very loudly and very\nenthusiastically about the project and its work, and he actively participated\non the mailing lists, in discussion channels, and in blog conversations. His\ncontributions were certainly valid: he acted as a champion and enthusiastic\nvoice in the project, encouraging others and getting people pumped up.\n\nAs time went on, his name started to be mentioned more than the project. He\nstarted performing speaking engagements around the world, and his blog became\nfilled with in-jokes shared with his well-respected, cool friends. He was very\nmuch part of the perceived “cool club,” if there is such a thing in\nultrahardcore technology circles.\n\nAs his fame grew, so did his inbox. He clearly felt that other people, with\n“less important” tasks, should respond to the email, as the demands on his\ntime were substantial. But he was also riddled with insecurity, and didn’t\nwant to loosen his grip on the project. Things stopped getting done. People\nstarted getting frustrated, but these frustrations were largely stifled by the\ncommunity. They didn’t really feel like they could speak out or criticize:\nthey felt that if you spoke out, you sounded like the only voice who did not\nrespect and appreciate the contributions of a “rock star.” What a pickle.\n\nOf course, this situation could not go on forever. People started to share\ntheir frustrations at conferences, in chat channels, and in other arenas.\nBefore long, annoyance and disrespect had become public, and ego had claimed\nanother victim.\n\nThe most frustrating part of this tale is that the guy in question was and\nstill is a good guy. At no point did malice or ill will drive any of his\ndecisions or actions. He simply got a little too big for his boots and lost\ntrack of how to manage his responsibilities.\n\nI would like to pretend that these cases are rare, but unfortunately they are\nnot. They happen every day, in a range of communities around the world, and\nyou should always have this risk at the forefront of your mind: don’t be\n_that_ guy.\n\n## Theory Versus Action: Action Wins\n\nA subtler side effect of ego is one that doesn’t threaten reputation so much\nas how you prioritize what is important. The threat is based on a sense that\nyour opinion, approach, and perspective are the only ones with merit. While\narrogance is one outcome of these elements, a much subtler risk that can\nbubble to the surface is becoming _too focused on theory_.\n\nTheory has an important place in community leadership. Heck, I have just spent\nthe past several sections talking about social capital, belonging, economy,\nbelief, and other theoretical dispositions. However, you will note that the\nhardcore theoretical content is confined to this chapter. The emphasis of our\nwork should be on getting on the front lines and trying out ideas instead of\nburying our heads in a book. Sure, read and learn, but use reading and theory\nto help you decide where to focus your practical efforts. The most critical\nlesson here is that you should never replace practical experience with theory.\n\nPart of the reason why I have filled this book with so many examples is that I\nbelieve that the most appropriate and effective form of teaching theory is\nsharing stories and experiences. I would much rather tell you a story about\nsomething that I experienced or heard than fill your mind with social science\ndefinitions and terms that would be enormously helpful in a game of Buzzword\nBingo but of limited use on the ground.\n\nUnfortunately, some folks have something of a love affair with theory. Many of\nthese people write extensive blog entries, give very generic (although well-\nmeaning) presentations, and often seem to think that their primary role is to\nimpart knowledge to others and sound as wildly academic as possible. But there\nis no secret ingredient in growing community. What makes a great community\nleader is experience: trying new ideas and concepts and learning from the\nsuccesses and mistakes.\n\nOf course, theory does have its place: it can help us to see, analyze, and\ndeconstruct the things that are in front of us. I have absolute respect for\npeople who teach others their art, but the teaching really needs to be\nsecondary to getting out and being there with your community and helping to\nlead and inspire them. Use theory as a means to see the shapes in the chaos,\nbut always ensure that you focus your primary efforts on making the chaos less\nchaotic.\n\n## Becoming Yourself\n\nBefore I wrap up this part of our journey, I want to go back to our earlier\ndiscussion about finding your “special sauce.” In the past few pages we have\ntalked about many of the admirable traits in a good community leader (trust,\npatience, respect, ability to listen, etc.) and some of the problematic traits\n(ego, control freak, theory obsession, etc.), and you may be a little lost in\nhow you can get the balance right. Fortunately, the solution is simple.\n\nBe yourself.\n\nYour “secret sauce” is you. Your personality is the greatest asset that you\nhave. Earlier we talked about how trust is the most critical component in\nbeing a great community leader. If you try to become someone who you are not,\nyou will sacrifice that most important of traits. Be yourself. Identify your\nown traits, celebrate the good, and learn to improve the bad, but always be\nyourself; it will put you in good stead.\n\nI learned this lesson when we started doing LugRadio. At the time, I was a\njournalist: I wrote for around 12 magazines and also wrote a number of columns\nfor various publications. As part of my work I would write my articles and\nfeatures in a text editor, and then have plenty of time to edit, choose my\nwords carefully, refine my language, and perfect my tone. I could perform\nplenty of research, ensure that my citations were accurate, and pull from a\nworldwide library of quotes and stories that would illustrate my points\neffectively. In a nutshell, being a journalist allowed me to take my voice and\nensure that it was as refined as possible.\n\nWe then started doing LugRadio. From day one, LugRadio was set to be a shoot-\nfrom-the-hip, loose, opinionated social exploration of Free Software and Free\nCulture topics. There was no editing. There was no censorship of opinions.\nEvery word that came out of our mouths was committed to history. It was\nballsy, it was controversial, but importantly, it was _us_. It was the honesty\nof LugRadio that we were all so proud of.\n\nAlthough my writing and journalistic work was honest and I never painted an\ninaccurate picture of my voice or viewpoints, the editing phase of writing\nadded a little more sheen and more opportunity to remove any controversial\naspects to my work. With LugRadio, every word that would flow out of my mouth\ninto people’s ears was much less formalized: it was me in my birthday suit, no\nholds barred.\n\nFor about two days I really worried about this. Was LugRadio going to affect\nmy career as a journalist? Would people think less of me because of my\nparticipation in this hugely opinionated tech audio show? Was I closing off\npotential opportunities if people heard me for who I really am?\n\nOne evening, while at my karate training, sweating and performing second kata,\nI decided I didn’t care. I had always promised myself that I would be myself\nin my professional and personal life. I would never cover up my perspectives,\nmy views, my interests, or my ambitions. I was always keen to be professional\nand respectful of the situations I was in, be they more formalized occasions\nor low-key social functions, but fundamentally the heart of my approach would\nbe my own. This was the first test of that approach, and since then I have\nnever looked back.\n\nI believe that this commitment to being who you are is critical to being a\ngreat community leader. My father-in-law’s statement—“Live your life\nhonestly—if you don’t, you always have to remember to not be\nyourself”—actually goes much deeper. Not only should we aspire to lead a good\nand principled life, but if we live it in a way that is honest to who we\nreally are, we never need to worry about maintaining the illusion. My father-\nin-law has taken that approach, and so has my father, and I have learned from\nthem and have incredible respect for their methods.\n\nIf you take this approach in your work and manage to do a good job engaging\nand working with your community, you will never need to worry about trust,\ntransparency, or respect; people will know that the words that come out of\nyour mouth are your own, that your opinions are your own, and that your advice\nis your own.\n\nThis is particularly important when you are a professional community manager.\nWhen I started working for Canonical as the Ubuntu community manager, I\nexpected people to worry that Canonical may be pulling the strings that make\nme dance. It has been very important to me that I demonstrate to any community\nI am involved in that my commitment to it is genuine, and I am as willing to\nstand up against the commercial sponsor as I am willing to stand up against\nthe community. Trust and responsibility is a two-way street.\n\n# Moving Forward\n\nIn this chapter we have grabbed a piece of paper and sketched out the primary\noutlines of community. We have discussed some of the high-level mechanisms of\nhow a community works, explored why people build community, and analyzed what\nkind of attributes exist in great community leaders. The aim of this chapter\nwas to build out an overview that we will delve into in more detail throughout\nthe rest of this book.\n\nThe next step in our journey is to build a plan for our community. Although a\ncommunity is a fairly organic collection of people and processes, we can\narchitect a surprising amount of structure around it. This gives us an\nopportunity to more easily map out the road ahead.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I am ready to roll. Let’s get to it....\n\n\n# Chapter 2. Planning Your Community\n\n“We must all hang together, or assuredly, we shall all hang separately.”\n\n—Benjamin Franklin\n\nMy best friend is a guy named Stuart Langridge, whom I call “Aq.” (He was\nnicknamed “Aquarius” in an online user group devoted to a fantasy author, for\nreasons that make my eyes glaze over when he tries to explain them.) I first\nmet Aq in Wolverhampton in Central England, where I’d moved to go to\nuniversity. We became fast friends.\n\nWith my curiosity initially piqued by Neil’s Linux User Group, I was eager to\nform my own: the cunningly named Wolverhampton Linux User Group. Six months\nlater, Aq wandered into a meeting, complete with now-trademark bombastic\npersonality.\n\nOver the years, Aq and I shared many a pint and a curry, debating and\ndiscussing every imaginable topic about Free Software. No subject was out of\nreach, and we relished in each other’s passion for the subject. We also\nrelished in the opportunity to prove each other wrong. These debates inspired\nmany projects. One of them was LugRadio.\n\nThroughout the life of LugRadio, Aq and I debated how we—or more specifically,\nI—recorded the show. As the resident musician in the fabulous foursome, with a\nroom full of recording equipment, I handled recording and editing, using Mac\nOS X and the Cubase audio production system.\n\nYes, folks, you read that right: LugRadio was a show all about Free Software\nbut recorded on a proprietary system, with a proprietary application.\nFortunately, the community took good stead to remind me of my alleged “freedom\nhating” pretty much every day. Lucky me. Unfortunately, I didn’t want to spend\nmy life engaged in the rocket science that was Linux audio engineering. I love\nto play music, not spend my days thinking about which sample size I should set\nmy software to.\n\nThe debate raged on, and I was getting increasingly sick of the discussion.\nSomething had to change.\n\nOne evening at Aq’s house, we were drinking tea and debating open source like\nnormal. One additional area in which my cantankerous friend and I shared a\ndeep interest was interaction design: how to make products and interfaces\neasier. Thus the topic of Linux audio recording arose.\n\nOur debate was more akin to resounding agreement. We both cited example after\nexample of poor interface decisions: methods of interaction that relied on\nredundant questions, complex assumed knowledge, and other travesties. My\nsolution was to start from scratch. So we did.\n\nWe thought it would be fun to totally rethink audio recording. We sat down\nwith paper and pens, and more cups of tea, discussing and debating until 4\na.m. When I got home and dragged my drained body into bed, my laptop bag\ncontained three pieces of paper outlining an entirely new approach to audio\nrecording.\n\nDespite our brainstorming efforts, I just didn’t have the time or knowledge to\nwrite an audio editor. I could have used my meager audio programming and\ndevelopment skills to produce a rather crufty attempt, but it would have been\nof little use, and I was already intensely busy. Despite this lack of time and\nskill, I didn’t want our designs to languish in obscurity, so I drafted some\nmock-ups and wrote a lengthy blog entry explaining how they worked. I informed\nthe LugRadio community and expected silence: the world moving on, our designs\nunnoticed.\n\nA few weeks later I wandered onto the LugRadio forums and noticed that some\ncode had been committed to a repository. I downloaded it and it looked like an\nincredibly simple first cut of the interface that existed in my mock-ups.\n\nI was stunned.\n\nSo was Aq.\n\nThe author was a rather nice chap called Jason Field who had a passion for\ncoding and Linux. I immediately emailed him to make contact. His simple\ncontribution had inspired me to consider the project further and to see\nwhether the designs were really possible to build. He said yes.\n\nThe LugRadio community members were equally intrigued by the story about this\nnew audio editor: they nicknamed it _JonoEdit_. I was flattered, if a little\nembarrassed.\n\nIt was time to get the machine rolling. We set up a code repository, a\nwebsite, a mailing list, and a bug tracker, and scheduled regular meetings. We\norganized hack days, bug squashing parties, and online discussions to plan and\nreach some major architectural decisions. New people joined the team,\nincluding Laszlo Pandy, who became the subsequent leader of the project.\n\nA little later in the development, the project got an important name change; I\nwasn’t keen on _JonoEdit_. After asking for suggestions, Steve Parkes, one of\nthe original LugRadio presenters, suggested _Jokosher_. The name was formed\nfrom “Jo” and “Kosher,” which he claimed as “No Bacon,” thus constructing my\nname. Again, I was flattered. It felt weird, but the team liked the new name,\nso we stuck with it.\n\nEveryone worked hard. We spent long evenings writing code, debugging, fixing\nbugs, and writing documentation. Piece by piece we built not only an\napplication but also a community. We developed a sense of unity, and we\nstarted to become a team.\n\nEventually, after months of work, we made a first release. From a few ideas,\nexpressed with my amateur-grade design skills, we built something that people\ncould touch. Today, although I have stepped back to work on other things,\nJokosher is a thriving project.\n\nMost Free Software projects form from one person scratching an itch. That\nperson writes code and releases it; if the code scratches other people’s\nitches, collaboration begins. Jokosher was different. It existed entirely on\npaper before it did in software. The application was rooted in a new approach\nto interaction design, so having a documented design was essential. The design\nand accompanying specification of the interface acted as a reference from\nwhich to build the software.\n\nWhat this experience taught me, entirely by chance, was that the speed and\nsuccess of a community has a direct correlation to strategy, structure, and\nplanning: even a simple set of mock-ups can help drive progress in the right\ndirection. Communities that appear more by accident than by intention tend to\nbe slow to develop and mature. Organized communities thrive because structure\nprovides a sense of worth, conviction, and oversight. A strategy will make\nthings happen for your community.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> From a product standpoint, we make our users stakeholders. We encourage and\n> enable users to customize Firefox and to take part in test driving and\n> providing feedback on our products.\n>\n> —Mary Colvig, on Strategy\n\nRead the [full interview](ch14.html#marycolvig \"Mary Colvig, Mozilla\") in\n[Chapter 14](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case Book\").\n\n# Planning for Success\n\nAs you will discover throughout _The Art of Community_ , I like to introduce\nconcepts in a very specific way. First I present a high-level discussion of\nthe top priorities and get the basics down. Next I focus on the details and\nflesh out the subject. This approach makes introducing the subject more akin\nto lowering yourself into a warm pool on a sunny day, as opposed to hurling\nyourself into an icy river in Finland.\n\nOur goal in this chapter is to explore how to build a strategy for our\ncommunities. We first explore four foundations within community. Each of these\nhouses the underlying details that we explore throughout the rest of the book.\nInside these foundations are teams, the vessels of community, which we later\ncrack open to see how they work. Next we define our mission, objectives, and\ngoals and build them into a final strategic plan. We are going to cover a lot\nof ground in this chapter, so grab a cup of tea (I would also recommend a\nHobnob to dip in it) and get comfortable.\n\nWith many areas of discussion, we need to pick out the key concepts and have\nthem close at hand. It is easy to forget or skim over some subtle yet\nimportant aspects in community growth. To make this simple, we will add them\nto a TODO list as we uncover them throughout the chapter.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Example item.\n\n  * Example item.\n\nLater in the book we will revisit this list and use it to form the basis of\nour strategic plan.\n\n## Community: The Bird’s-Eye View\n\nBuilding a strong community is an exhilarating and rewarding prospect, but\ngetting there can be complex. You only need to look at this book’s table of\ncontents to see that the subject is hugely diverse and detailed.\n\nWe first need to step back and understand our broad aims. When we wake up and\ndecide we want to build a community, what do we want to achieve? Aside from\nthe goals of the community itself, be it building a software project, changing\na political system, or whatever else, how do we inspire a collection of people\nto march forward as one? How exactly do we unite a people? Well, we can\nexplain this using…dots.\n\nYes, dots.\n\nI know what you are thinking: you are mad, Bacon. Dots seem a little simple.\nSure they are, but they’re different in many ways. Different colors, different\nsizes, different shapes. You may not know this, but dots have oodles of\npersonality. Take the three dots shown in [Figure\n2-1](ch02.html#the_dot_family._don_apostrophy_t_they \"Figure 2-1. The Dot\nfamily. Don’t they look cute?\").\n\n![The Dot family. Don’t they look\ncute?](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159239.png)\n\nFigure 2-1. The Dot family. Don’t they look cute?\n\nReaders, I would like to introduce you to the Dot family: John, Pauline, and\nKen. Although similar looking, each has a very distinctive personality and\nskills. What brings them together is the same passion: creating a completely\nnew and original social networking website, built for dots, by dots,\ncalled…DotBook.\n\nJohn, Pauline, and Ken contribute in very different ways. John (left) is a\nprogrammer, Pauline (middle) loves to write documentation, and Ken (right) is\nrather fond of drawing. I know, he looks like the arty type.\n\nJohn, Pauline, and Ken are not alone. There are lots of dots like them out\nthere on the Internet....\n\nThe problem, as you can see in [Figure\n2-2](ch02.html#the_dot_family_is_not_alone \"Figure 2-2. The Dot family is not\nalone.\"), is that all of the Johns, Paulines, and Kens, and their respective\nskills, are scattered all over the Internet. They don’t really know one\nanother. They are all united by the same goal, but they’re not working\ntogether.\n\n![The Dot family is not\nalone.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159241.png)\n\nFigure 2-2. The Dot family is not alone.\n\nA community is just like [Figure 2-2](ch02.html#the_dot_family_is_not_alone\n\"Figure 2-2. The Dot family is not alone.\"): a scattered collection of dots.\nOne of our first goals is to bring these connected areas of interest together\ninto well-formed teams. It turns out that when Johns are able to talk to other\nJohns, some interesting things can happen. These teams are important\ncontainers of expertise and interest inside our wider community (see [Figure\n2-3](ch02.html#uniting_people_by_their_interest_and_pas \"Figure 2-3. Uniting\npeople by their interests and passions is an important first step in growing a\nstrong community.\")).\n\n![Uniting people by their interests and passions is an important first step in\ngrowing a strong community.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159243.png)\n\nFigure 2-3. Uniting people by their interests and passions is an important\nfirst step in growing a strong community.\n\nIf we think of a community as an interspersed group of dots huddled together\nover a shared interest (e.g., protesting a ludicrous law, discussing a topic,\nbuilding an operating system), teams are the smaller subgroups typically based\naround a primary interest or skill set (e.g., advocacy and documentation) that\nhelps forward that shared interest.\n\nAs an example, the Ubuntu community has a shared interest in building a Free\nSoftware operating system. To do this there are many smaller groups who\nperform translations, produce packages, write documentation, test software,\nadvocate Ubuntu, and much more. These are the teams that we seek to build: to\nbreak our wider community into smaller, more manageable chunks. Each team is\nunited by solving a part of the grander aim of the community.\n\nTeams are an essential construct in community building: they are not only the\ncontainers in which your community grows, but also convenient units of ability\nthat help you to strategically understand and structure your community and\nfind out what it’s capable of. When John Dot meets other dots who share his\ninterests and get excited at the same opportunities, teams also become\ncontainers of _belonging_.\n\nAlthough teams have a primary focus (typically a skill, such as art or\ndocumentation), you should not be too rigid in that focus. Every team will\nhave members who are interested in this primary function but who will also\nbring other expertise and insight to the team. As an example, in a software\ncommunity, it is hugely valuable for the art team to also have members with\nabilities in programming: they can often expedite getting art contributions\nimplemented in the technical development of the application. As such,\nencourage and optimize for membership based on the primary focus of the team,\nbut also celebrate and make use of the other skills of your members.\n\nTeams offer a wealth of opportunities and benefits in building a strong\ncommunity, and we discuss them extensively later in this chapter. Let’s first\nadd this goal to our TODO list.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Identify how we can divide our community into teams.\n\nAlthough constructing teams is valuable, it is not enough. As a unit of\nability, a team is still part of a wider community that strives for a common\ngoal. We need to ensure that our teams fit together like a completed jigsaw\npuzzle. Communication, ideas, and stories must flow freely between your teams,\nas in [Figure 2-4](ch02.html#communication_between_teams_is_essential\n\"Figure 2-4. Communication between teams is essential.\").\n\n![Communication between teams is\nessential.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159245.png)\n\nFigure 2-4. Communication between teams is essential.\n\nThe flow of communication between teams is a lot more complex than you would\nfirst imagine. How can you ensure an easy flow of ideas and progress between\ntwo teams who focus on different parts of the community? How does your art\nteam communicate well with your development team? This opens up a huge array\nof questions. Even with the three teams in [Figure\n2-4](ch02.html#communication_between_teams_is_essential\n\"Figure 2-4. Communication between teams is essential.\"), how do they\ncommunicate? What mediums do they use? How do they deal with geographic and\ntime zone issues? How do they report their interactions to the wider\ncommunity? How do they track progress? How do we understand how different\nteams work together? Not an easy problem to solve.\n\nThese questions are not merely about how two or three teams communicate. They\nget to the heart of the ethos of the community as a whole: the standard for\nhow teams are structured, how they behave, and how they communicate.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, although your teams have a primary focus (such as\ntranslations), there will be many other skills present in your teams, and many\npeople will be in multiple teams. We need to not only foster effective\ncommunication between teams (such as regular meetings, progress checks, and\nshared communication mediums) but also make use of people who have their feet\nin multiple teams. They can be the glue that sticks teams together. These\npeople should absolutely be on your Christmas card list.\n\nThis topic is part of _governance_ , and is so large and critical to community\nsuccess that I have dedicated [Chapter 10](ch10.html \"Chapter 10. Governance\")\nto it later in this book. Let’s ensure that we make a note of team\ncommunication on our TODO list, even though we’re not looking at how to build\nthis until later, when we discuss governance.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Identify how we can divide our community into teams.\n\n  * Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively.\n\nThe next area to focus on is contributor growth. We like dots like John,\nPauline, and Ken, and we want to encourage more of them into our community, as\nwe can see in [Figure 2-5](ch02.html#bringing_new_contributors_in_is_an_essen\n\"Figure 2-5. Bringing in new contributors is an essential task.\").\n\n![Bringing in new contributors is an essential\ntask.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159247.png)\n\nFigure 2-5. Bringing in new contributors is an essential task.\n\nWhen it comes to new contributors, we essentially seek to satisfy two primary\ndesires: _capacity_ and _diversity_.\n\nWith _capacity_ , our goal is to provide more hands on deck. More\n(coordinated) hands generally mean that more things get done. Most communities\nhave somewhat audacious goals (which we will discuss later), and these goals\nalmost always outstrip the resources available to implement them. This\nbottleneck can cause burnout (a topic we discuss extensively in [Chapter\n11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\")), but more\nimmediately it generates a need to find more resources.\n\nAttracting members to your community is one task, but attracting a diverse\nrange of contributors is an entirely different ball game. Although not\ncritical in a community, diversity has huge value: different skills, cultures,\nperspectives, attitudes, and experiences make for a richer community\nexperience.\n\nLater in this book, in [Chapter 7](ch07.html \"Chapter 7. Building Buzz\"), we\nexplore how to attract members to your community. This requires not only\nmaking your community attractive to prospective members but also offering them\nan effective workflow so that they see their contributions put to use without\ntoo much hassle. What challenges do your members face in contributing? How can\nwe make the barriers as low as possible to new blood while still bringing in\nthe right skills? What are the right skills? Let’s add this important goal to\nthe TODO list.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Identify how we can divide our community into teams.\n\n  * Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively.\n\n  * Attract a diverse range of contributors to our community to get involved and contribute to our goals.\n\nThe final major step in building a strong community is in building a positive\nenvironment, as shown in [Figure\n2-6](ch02.html#build_a_strong_environment_comma_and_you \"Figure 2-6. Build a\nstrong environment, and you will have a strong team.\") (we will focus on\nbuilding a strong environment in [Chapter 4](ch04.html \"Chapter 4. Processes:\nSimple Is Sustainable\")). Your community should feel inspired, engaged, and\nthrilled by the opportunity to achieve the goals they dream of.\n\n![Build a strong environment, and you will have a strong\nteam.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159249.png)\n\nFigure 2-6. Build a strong environment, and you will have a strong team.\n\nEnvironment plays a huge role in everything that we do. Every element of our\nenvironment affects our perspectives, emotions, and expectations.\n\nConsider a conventional environment such as a neighborhood. Many environmental\nattributes can affect perception, with one such example being the feeling of\nsafety. Examples that affect this feeling include the size and style of the\nhouses; the types of cars on the street; the residents, what they wear, and\ntheir body language; the lighting of the street at night; the background\nnoise; the amount of traffic; and more. Compare and contrast a seemingly\nfriendly, social neighborhood in which kids are walking around and people are\ntalking in the street, with an unfriendly, closed, and restricted place in\nwhich few people are talking and sharing their lives with one another. Money\nis not the decider here: super-expensive gated communities are often as\nsocially sparse as very poor inner-city tower blocks. Fundamentally, both have\nthe same core pieces—houses, roads, cars, streetlights, residents, and so\non—but the environment hugely affects perception. The mental perception of a\nquaint country town adorned with its small streets, tea shops, and abundance\nof elderly people playing chess is very different from that of an inner-city\nblock with its square buildings, large gates, and commuters rushing to work.\n\nEnvironment not only affects perception but opportunity, too. In a\nneighborhood that is perceived as unsafe, residents are less likely to\ninteract with one another due to fear. In a community that feels safe and\nwelcoming, local groups, ad hoc conversations, and other interactions thrive.\nThese considerations don’t just apply to geographical communities; your online\nenvironment is equally important.\n\nLet’s add environment to the list and take a quick recap of our key issues\nthus far.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Identify how we can divide our community into teams.\n\n  * Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively.\n\n  * Attract a diverse range of contributors to our community to get involved and contribute to our goals.\n\n  * Build an environment conducive to our wider goals.\n\n# Teams: The Building Blocks of Belonging\n\nEvery goal on our TODO list is key to strong community, and although you may\nnot realize it, every item on that list also has a commonality: _teams_. Let’s\nexplore this in more detail.\n\nTeams are the building blocks of community structure; they are the Lego bricks\nthat build an army of volunteers united by a mission. But as building blocks,\nthey fit together in many different ways, with countless variations and\npossibilities in how they are constructed.\n\nFor us to understand community, we need to understand what makes teams tick.\nWe are now going to spend some time focusing on the essential ingredients that\nshould be present in all teams. These ingredients are the best-practice\nelements that make teams strong, welcoming, and productive. We will explore\nthese foundational ingredients now, and then later in the chapter we will\ndetermine which specific teams will comprise our community.\n\n## Finding Your Place\n\nEveryone has dreams. We all have ambitions and experiences that we lust after,\nand we are all guilty of using the opportunity of a rainy day to stare out the\nwindow and let our minds take us toward these grand visions, be they flying\ninto space, making millions of dollars, or playing bass guitar in front of\nthousands of people.\n\nAdam Sweet’s dreams were different. He _had_ played bass in front of thousands\nof people. The young, spiky-haired, cigarette-smoking bundle of energy got a\nband together with his friends and managed to score a record deal at the\ntender age of 18. Known as Passion Star, the band went on to play the Radio\nOne Roadshow: a UK-wide tour composed of established artists and new talent.\n\nThough it sounded fun, Adam had had enough. He wanted normality. He wanted a\nhouse, a girlfriend, and a regular life, not life in a small bus with four\nhygienically challenged musos. Adam still wanted a passion, though (without\nthe star). He needed an interest to wrap his natural sense of curiosity and\nexploration around. So he bought a computer.\n\nEven though it was the year 2000 and he was 24, it may surprise you that Adam\nhad never owned a computer before. Immediately puzzled with his new friend, he\nbought a magazine to understand it better, and said magazine happened to\nfeature the Linux operating system on the cover. Not knowing any better, he\njumped in and installed it. Of course, it was an epic disaster, as Linux\ngenerally was back then. While trying to find help, Adam stumbled across his\nfirst community, which doubled as a team: my Linux user group.\n\nWhen Adam walked in, he faced the same fears, uncertainties, and curiosities\nthat I shared at the start of the book. However, he was equally as inspired\nand intrigued by the concept of community. Although he felt weird, he also\nfelt compelled to stick with it.\n\nWhen Adam first joined the group, he asked a barrage of questions, regularly\napologizing when he felt they were “stupid,” despite reassurances that there\nwere no stupid questions.\n\nAs he built his confidence, he started experimenting. The group had become an\nexcellent place for people to give away old equipment. Adam would take this\nendless stream of clapped-out gadgets, try new software, and share his\nexperiences with the rest of the group. As new members joined and asked\nquestions, he would answer them and share his experiences. He was fast\nbecoming something of a Linux expert.\n\nHe continued to play, continued to grow, studied at university, and, before\nlong, landed a job as a system administrator. Shortly after that he met his\ngirlfriend, Jenny, and soon they moved into their own house, Adam had achieved\nwhat he wanted: normality, a sense of security, and a passion.\n\nWhat I find so endearing about Adam’s story is that a Linux user group (a team\nwithin the general Linux community) was so instrumental in furthering his\nambitions. If Adam had not joined a team, whether my LUG or any other group, I\nam not sure that the story would have had the same ending.\n\nTeams fill an important role in a strong community: they are small ecosystems\nwith attributes that can be hugely valuable to success on the wider scale of\nyour community. Once we’ve taken a high-level look at these attributes, we can\nuse this knowledge to build our practical implementation strategy later in\nthis chapter.\n\n## Units of Belonging\n\nTeams are units of belonging. Members join, are energized by the team’s\nspirit, and develop a sense of belonging that encourages them to contribute\nback to the team. This “Circle of Life” philosophy provides the team with a\nconsistent exchange of experiences and value.\n\nIf we slice open a team, we can see a number of generations, like rings in a\ntree trunk. Each generation is a source of stories (already established in the\nprevious chapter as an important source of communication) and also a source of\nmentorship. Each generation passes down stories, experiences, and life lessons\nto the new generation.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with Adam. When he joined the group, he needed\nassistance and support. When he received this help, the team provided a sense\nof value to him. This value inspired Adam to treat the team with respect and\nto prioritize its importance in his life. As the team opened doors to\nknowledge, social connections opened and he felt a sense of belonging. This\nbelonging was sealed each time he imparted his own experience to new and\nexisting members of the group; he would duly receive the appreciation and\nthanks that he delivered to others when he was new.\n\nPart of the reason why Adam had such a positive experience is that he\nunderstood the full breadth of the team. In any natural human grouping,\n_scope_ and familiarity of environment play an important role.\n\nScope defines the breadth and range of something. It is the length of a book,\nthe size of a festival venue, and the comprehensiveness of a project. Scope\ndescribes the extent of the mental fishbowl that you are in, be it a book,\nvenue, or initiative. A typical example of scope that is familiar to all of us\nis the place in which we live.\n\nThe world is a pretty big place. Its magnitude is reinforced by the\ntelevision, websites, books, stories, and photographs that we see every day.\nFor thousands of years, humans and animals have developed a natural\ninclination to divide the world into more manageable chunks. Society takes the\nsame approach: countries are divided into states and counties; states and\ncounties are divided into cities, towns, and villages; and cities, towns, and\nvillages are divided into streets and, ultimately, houses.\n\nGeographical communities are analogous to digital communities: with both, our\nperception affects our confidence. Take the example of someone who relocates\nto an entirely new area. For most people who have just moved, the environment\nis initially hugely overwhelming. Once this person has explored most parts of\nher city, town, or village and knows where the grocery store, hospitals, and\nother key resources are, she starts to develop a sense of confidence.\nUnderstanding the scope of the area gives us this confidence.\n\nThe reason for this is that we are all raised to be cautious of the unknown.\nUnfortunately, this makes us afraid of it, too. When we know the full extent\nof the fishbowl that we live in, as well as the other fish in that bowl, it\nhelps us to build a measured sense of safety. Your sense of scope makes you\nfeel safe when you confirm that you live on a safe street and not in the\nmiddle of a gangland.\n\nThe scope of the natives also affects our perception. Contrast someone with\nfew friends and seemingly alien neighbors with someone who has lots of friends\nand very social neighbors. When you start to make recurring personal\nconnections with regular friends, acquaintances, and love interests, a sense\nof belonging begins to flow through your veins. This is no different in a\nsmall face-to-face or online community.\n\nTeams are hugely valuable in providing a manageable scope for your new\ncontributors. If your community has 1,000 people in it in a single team, your\ncommunity can feel overwhelming. If your community is instead broken down into\n10 teams, each with 100 people in it, and each team focuses on a distinctive\narea, this is far more approachable.\n\nLet’s add this important premise of team building to our TODO list.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Identify how we can divide our community into teams.\n\n  * Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively.\n\n  * Attract a diverse range of contributors to our community to get involved and contribute to our goals.\n\n  * Build an environment conducive to our wider goals.\n\n  * Define the scope of each team, and help team members understand that scope.\n\n## Read Versus Write\n\nCommunities come in many forms. They surround books, movies, software\nproducts, political campaigns, civil rights efforts, hobbies, and more. In all\ntheir colorful and varied forms, all communities share one distinctive trait:\nthe unity of people around a shared belief or interest. It is passion that\nbinds these people together.\n\n### Read-mostly communities\n\nA great example of this passion is _Star Trek_ fans. While I am by no means a\nmember of that community (and only have a basic knowledge of the show), it is\nclearly far-reaching and maintains an extensive membership. _Trekkies_ , as\nthey are known, gather around the world to discuss, debate, and consume _Star\nTrek_ in all of its wild and rather weird glory. Oh, and they wear quite\nridiculous and at times bizarre outfits, too.\n\nWe can define Trekkies as _fans_ —they enjoy a common interest together,\neither online or at conventions around the world, and their primary role is to\nshare the consumption of that interest with others. As fans, Trekkies rarely\nhave any direct impact on the unifying interest: the average Trekkie could not\nchange the storyline of the show, contribute to the costumes or the digital\neffects, or improve what already exists. Instead, collaboration in the Trekkie\nworld produces content for other Trekkies: it won’t take you long to find\nwonderfully detailed fan-made costumes, props, tattoos, fan fiction, and other\ncreations.\n\nAlthough there appears to be a very distinctive collaborative divide between\nthe provider (the show) and the consumer (the fan), there is a middle ground.\nThese communities are becoming increasingly important to providers and never\nbefore have artists, musicians, producers, and politicians been so aware of\ntheir followers. The Internet has enabled fans to connect more easily with\ntheir heroes, and this has developed a kind of collaboration.\n\nThere are many examples of this. Stephen Fry, a well-respected British actor,\nstarted using the Twitter microblogging service and within months he had\n400,000 people following his updates. The Obama administration has made use of\nblogging and YouTube extensively to distribute content and invite feedback.\n\nOne producer who has engaged repeatedly with his fan community is Joss Whedon,\nthe Academy Award-nominated and Hugo Award-winning American writer, director,\nand executive producer of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. Whedon has been known to\nuse a range of online mediums to interact with fans, and has even referenced\nfan contributions in his work.\n\nOne such example was a reference in an episode to a “Polgara demon.” The name\n“Polgara” originally comes from books written by American author David\nEddings. Whedon’s decision to use the name was inspired by a fan who posted\nregularly to the official _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ forum with the same name.\nWhedon and producer David Fury used the name as a tribute to her regular\ncontributions in the community.\n\nAnother example of Whedon’s commitment to his community bubbled to the surface\nduring a writers’ strike. He worked with other writers to write and produce\n_Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog_ , a 45-minute short musical that was released\non the Internet. Each episode of the musical went online for only a few days,\nand Whedon generated interest inside the community using Twitter to interact\nwith the fans.\n\nThese are all examples of community building in action. Producers are uniting\ngroups of interested people together, providing communication facilities, and\nencouraging and enabling those people to collaborate. Even if the extent of\nthat collaboration is a group of fans providing feedback on a forum,\ncollaboration still happens.\n\nThis is how most communities work. Collaboration is an unofficial by-product,\nand although it may not change or improve on the creation of the producer, it\nis still likely to offer real value. The primary focus in these communities is\nto ensure that the community (a) always has access to the product and (b) can\ncommunicate about it with others. The foundation of these kinds of communities\nis _access_.\n\nWhile each community has the characteristic of people gathering around a\nshared belief or interest, the actual impact of the community on this shared\nbelief or interest varies greatly.\n\n### Write-centered communities\n\nFor some communities, collaboration goes much further. It becomes much deeper,\nmore intrinsic, and more accessible to all. Instead of merely _enjoying things\ntogether_ , collaboration goes so far as to help people _create things\ntogether_. In these environments, the community also assumes the role of\nproducer of the content.\n\nThe typical example here is one of the many Free Culture communities, such as\nLinux, Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, Creative Commons, and so on. In these\ncommunities, community members have the opportunity to change the very content\nthat brings them together.\n\nThe Ubuntu community is one such example. Ubuntu is an entirely free Linux\noperating system that is designed to provide a complete, free, stable, and\nsecure system for desktops, servers, or mobile devices. Ubuntu is built using\nhundreds of pieces of preexisting Free Software tools that we refer to as\n_upstream_ applications. Each upstream application has its own community of\nvolunteers and developers. Ubuntu itself has a community of volunteers and\ndevelopers who take said upstream software and assemble it in an easy-to-\ninstall and easy-to-use system.\n\nUbuntu has spawned a huge community. Over 200 Ubuntu user groups, known as\nUbuntu LoCo teams, have formed around the world. Nearly every country has a\nLoCo team, with a range of users from Linux experts to entirely new users.\nThese people are, in a word, _awesome_. (Maybe I am a little biased....)\n\nAnyone in the Ubuntu community can affect what appears in Ubuntu itself. Every\npart of the system is open to contribution. This includes the software on the\ndisk, the supporting documentation and resources, art and design, bug reports,\nand almost anything else. Everyone has the opportunity, through hard work and\nmerit, to make a positive contribution to the Ubuntu system that the community\ngathers around.\n\nUnderstanding how our communities collaborate is important to understanding\nwhat we want to achieve and what is possible. Let’s add this to our TODO list.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Identify how we can divide our community into teams.\n\n  * Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively.\n\n  * Attract a diverse range of contributors to our community to get involved and contribute to our goals.\n\n  * Build an environment conducive to our wider goals.\n\n  * Define the scope of each team, and help team members understand that scope.\n\n  * Understand the extent and range of collaboration between our teams.\n\n## Meritocracy\n\nBefore we continue to build the blueprint for our community, I want to take a\nfew minutes to digress and talk about an interesting social attribute that\napplies to many (but not all) communities: _meritocracy_.\n\nA meritocracy is a system of governance in which its members are given\nresponsibilities and recognition based on achievements, merit, and talent.\nThose who are part of a meritocracy (such as in the Ubuntu and other open\nsource communities) can make tremendous advances in respect and responsibility\nby simply doing good work. In these communities, money, class, and family\nconnections have little or no impact on the ability to progress and build a\nreputation.\n\nThe magic of meritocracies is that the playing field is level for _everyone_.\nThose who work hard and show a recurring commitment to the community are\nrewarded. Those who think that driving a car with a blue neon light underneath\nit will impress us are going to be sadly disappointed.\n\nFew would argue that a meritocracy is a bad thing. Its fundamental basis is in\nrewarding hard work. This concept largely maps to the general life lessons\nthat we are all raised with: work hard and you reap the rewards of your\nefforts.\n\nIn these collaborative meritocracies, our primary goal is to ensure that the\ncommunication and contribution channels to collaboration are open, well\ndefined, and enforced. These communities are complex: there are many different\naspects that affect how simple it is to become involved and collaborate.\n\nAlthough meritocracies represent the poster child for what many consider great\ncommunities, they are _not_ a requirement. Some communities absolutely\ndistinguish between members based on who they are, where they come from, and\nother attributes. This has been particularly applicable for business-oriented\ncommunities that maintain a clear hierarchy and members who are by no means\nconsidered equal.\n\nYour community needs to decide for itself whether it is a meritocracy. I\nwould, however, tender one piece of advice: if you are involved in a volunteer\ncommunity that is open to all, I would highly recommend you take a\nmeritocratic approach. It will make your community look and feel more\naccessible and help to encourage a sense of belonging and equality as opposed\nto a community divided by classes. From the perspective of new members, the\nopportunities offered by meritocracies are inspiring. It is hugely attractive\nto members when anyone can join a community and further themselves and their\nreputation based on great work and participation.\n\nIf your community is currently or has decided to be a meritocracy, you should\ncommunicate this extensively to the outside world. Don’t use the word\n_meritocracy_ , though: most people have no idea what it means. Instead, talk\nof equality and provide examples of how your members have built their\nreputations based on their efforts.\n\nWe talk about many of these areas throughout the book, specifically when we\ntalk about _processes_ in [Chapter 4](ch04.html \"Chapter 4. Processes: Simple\nIs Sustainable\") and _infrastructure_ in [Chapter 5](ch05.html\n\"Chapter 5. Supporting Workflow with Tools and Data\"). For now, though, we\nneed to focus on the raw material that forms teams— _people_.\n\n## Working Together Is Success\n\nHenry Ford was a pretty smart guy. In 1891 he went to work for Edison\nIlluminating Company, where he started experimenting with the concept of a\ngasoline engine. After refining his design into what he called the Ford\nQuadricycle, he resigned in 1899 and founded the Detroit Automobile Company,\nwhich would later become the Ford Motor Company.\n\nAlthough Ford was a brilliant engineer, this is not why I am talking about\nhim. Instead, it’s because of this quote that slipped out of him:\n\n> Coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress, working\n> together is success.\n\nAlthough many consider Henry Ford the founding father of the motor car, this\nquote points to his other incredible achievement: understanding and motivating\npeople.\n\nFord was very firmly a businessman who had his beady eye on the dollar, but in\naddition to this he was a pioneer of _welfare capitalism_ , intended to reduce\nstaff turnover and improve efficiency. To achieve this, he used many methods:\nhe paid his staff a higher salary, improved working conditions, and automated\nlarge parts of the process. We can thank Henry Ford for inspiring the modern\nassembly lines that we see in mass production factories around the world.\n(Those of you who work on such lines may not be quite so enamored, mind.)\n\nFord built a business based not only on a core product, but also on an\nunderstanding of people. He knew how to divide his workforce into teams and\nhave them work together to produce a single, consistent product. He knew that\npeople driven by a common goal and united in similar skill sets would be\nproductive. And he was right.\n\nOne of Ford’s most significant and, at the time, controversial initiatives was\nthe introduction of a 40-hour week and a minimum wage. His seemingly generous\nincrease took a daily wage from $2.34 to $5. Back in 1914, this was unheard\nof, and rocked other industrialists and Wall Street. Ford’s reasoning was\nsimple and elegant, though: he wanted his employees to be able to afford the\nvery cars they were building.\n\nFord knew that if his employees could afford to buy Ford cars, they would\nvalue their contributions to the company more. His employees would be able to\nsee, feel, and enjoy the fruits of their labor.\n\nYour teams also need to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Volunteer communities\ncan sometimes feel like production lines. The work is not always enjoyable and\nnot always pleasant. There are times in every community when repetition,\nhousekeeping, and conflict play a role in an otherwise enjoyable merry-go-\nround. When the community begins to see more bureaucracy and repetition than\nuseful and enjoyable contributions, something is wrong. Very wrong. It is\nimportant, in these challenging times, to remind your community members of\ntheir crusade and the value of their work in achieving it.\n\nFord’s generous wages did not come without a catch. The increased salary that\nhis workers enjoyed was only available to employees who had been at the\ncompany for six months or more, and also demanded that employees lived their\nlives in a way that the company’s “Social Department” approved of: no\nexcessive drinking or gambling. Erk. Unsurprisingly, that scheme was soon\nabolished, and the company had to accept its staff for who they were.\n_Diversity_ was becoming a hot topic, and continues to be in any community.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe building blocks of community are its teams, and the material that makes\nthese blocks are people. When we understand people, we can build humane\nenvironments that are energizing and inspiring. Central elements of a healthy\nenvironment are respect, diversity, and rewarding people for their efforts,\nregardless of who they are or where they come from.\n\nTypically, when we talk about diversity, we use familiar examples: gender,\nrace, sexuality, and class. Although important, these poster children of\ndiversity can sometimes focus attention away from subtler and potentially more\npotent forms of diversity that we can encourage, explore, and celebrate.\nDiversity descends much deeper than skin color and gender.\n\nGeorge B. Graen, author of _Dealing with Diversity_ (Information Age\nPublishing), argues that not all differences are equally relevant or as\nimportant as you would think in all circumstances. He broadly divides\ndiversity into _surface-level_ diversity—readily observable characteristics\nsuch as race, gender, and age—and _deep-level diversity_ , important but less\nreadily transparent traits such as personality, values, and attitudes.\n\nBuilding deep-level diversity can bring a wealth of goodwill and openness to\nyour community. Often these deeper, hidden kinds of diversity teach us life’s\nmost valuable lessons. While all equality is important, we need to grow this\nsense of deep-level diversity.\n\nAt the start of the chapter we identified that we need to build an environment\nthat is conducive to energizing and enabling our community. Deep-level\ndiversity is the open door that welcomes this enablement. When you encourage\nthis deep-level diversity of contributions (e.g., translations, documentation,\ndevelopment) as well as diversity of opinions, values, and experience, your\nmembers will feel unrestrained, unrestricted, and energized. This should be a\nconstant consideration throughout your work.\n\nUnfortunately, many communities merely focus on hammering home equality of\nsurface-level diversity, but Graen suggests in _Dealing with Diversity_ that\nit doesn’t make a big difference in the effectiveness of the community:\n\n> In a study of 45 teams from electronics divisions of three major\n> corporations, Pelled, Eisenhardt, and Xin (1999) found that the effects of\n> surface-level diversity (age) on emotional conflict diminished as a function\n> of team longevity. Similarly, Chatman and Flynn (2001) found that\n> demographic homogeneity (race and gender) was less predictive of team\n> cooperation as team members interacted with each other.\n\nThis insight is interesting when combined with another research study, also\ndiscussed in Graen's book, that found that deep-level diversity provides the\nkinds of benefits we are looking for:\n\n> In a study of 144 student project teams, Harrison, Price, Gavin, and Florey\n> (2002) found that surface-level diversity negatively affected early cohesion\n> in the team. Over the course of a semester working together, surface-level\n> diversity became less predictive, whereas actual deep-level diversity\n> (measured by conscientiousness, task meaningfulness, and outcome importance)\n> and perceptions of deep-level diversity became increasingly important to\n> team social cohesion and performance.\n\nAlthough this experiment may seem a little abstract, Graen summarizes that “as\nteam members interact, attributions about underlying differences based on\nrace, gender, and age are likely to be minimized; however, the underlying\ndifferences in terms of personality, values, and attitudes are likely to have\nan increasingly negative effect on team cohesion and performance.” We need to\nbe cognizant of these underlying deep-level attributes in people and ensure\nthat we encourage and help them thrive in our communities.\n\nDeep-level diversity is further underlined by the sheer extent of diversity in\nmost communities, particularly those online. Diversity is everywhere. We have\nso many opinions (sometimes it can feel like too many), viewpoints,\nperspectives, recommendations, and other reactions to stimuli. At every step,\nwe need to foster and encourage open and frank debate. Every communication\nchannel that you construct needs to have a common theme of openness and\nrespect that encourages this kind of diversity.\n\nAlthough this is an intellectually responsible position, people are people,\nand people can be irresponsible. For diversity to thrive and prosper, it needs\nto be built on a foundation of _respect_. When members of a community are\nrespectful and considerate of one another, it encourages an environment in\nwhich people feel comfortable bringing their own kind of diversity to the\ngame. It is this respect that affirms Graen’s previous acknowledgment of the\nrisks of diversity on team cohesion and performance.\n\nIn the Ubuntu community, there is an important document called the “Ubuntu\nCode of Conduct” that builds this foundation of respect in contributors. I\nhave reproduced the core of the document here, as it not only outlines these\ncore attributes of respect, but also could be useful in a range of\ncommunities:\n\nBe considerate\n\n    \n\nYour work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the\nwork of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and we\nexpect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions. For\nexample, when we are in a feature freeze, please don’t upload dramatically new\nversions of critical system software, as other people will be testing the\nfrozen system and will not be expecting big changes.\n\nBe respectful\n\n    \n\nThe Ubuntu community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone\ncan make a valuable contribution to Ubuntu. We may not always agree, but\ndisagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all\nexperience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration\nto turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community\nwhere people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We\nexpect members of the Ubuntu community to be respectful when dealing with\nother contributors as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project, and with\nusers of Ubuntu.\n\nBe collaborative\n\n    \n\nUbuntu and Free Software are about collaboration and working together.\nCollaboration reduces redundancy of work done in the Free Software world, and\nimproves the quality of the software produced. You should aim to collaborate\nwith other Ubuntu maintainers, as well as with the upstream community that is\ninterested in the work you do. Your work should be done transparently and\npatches from Ubuntu should be given back to the community when they are made,\nnot just when the distribution releases. If you wish to work on new code for\nexisting upstream projects, at least keep those projects informed of your\nideas and progress. It may not be possible to get consensus from upstream or\neven from your colleagues about the correct implementation of an idea, so\ndon’t feel obliged to have that agreement before you begin, but at least keep\nthe outside world informed of your work, and publish your work in a way that\nallows outsiders to test, discuss, and contribute to your efforts.\n\nWhen you disagree, consult others\n\n    \n\nDisagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time, and the\nUbuntu community is no exception. The important goal is not to avoid\ndisagreements or differing views but to resolve them constructively. You\nshould turn to the community and to the community process to seek advice and\nto resolve disagreements. We have the Technical Board and the Community\nCouncil, both of which will help to decide the right course for Ubuntu. There\nare also several Project Teams and Team Leaders, who may be able to help you\nfigure out which direction will be most acceptable. If you really want to go a\ndifferent way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or\nalternative set of packages available using the Ubuntu Package Management\nframework, so that the community can try out your changes and ideas for itself\nand contribute to the discussion.\n\nWhen you are unsure, ask for help\n\n    \n\nNobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the Ubuntu\ncommunity (except of course the SABDFL [Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator for\nLife]). Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions\nare encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful. However,\nwhen asking a question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate forum.\nOff-topic questions, such as requests for help on a development mailing list,\ndetract from productive discussion.\n\nStep down considerately\n\n    \n\nDevelopers on every project come and go, and Ubuntu is no different. When you\nleave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do\nso in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should\ntell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others\ncan pick up where you leave off.\n\n### Note\n\nThe “Ubuntu Code of Conduct” is available at\n<http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct> and licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike license, which allows you to use it in your own\ncommunities. Although a Code of Conduct is not required for a thriving\ncommunity, it is highly recommended.\n\nAlthough the “Ubuntu Code of Conduct” draws attention to understanding and\nrespecting a deep level of diversity, it is sometimes misinterpreted as simply\n“don’t be an idiot.” It means far more than that: it encourages us to not only\ntake responsibility for our actions and our reactions, but also to use this\ndiversity as an opportunity to learn and grow, turning differences into\nopportunities for personal development and learning.\n\nTherefore, in addition to adding diversity as a goal to the TODO list, let us\nalso note that we should put in place a Code of Conduct.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Identify how we can divide our community into teams.\n\n  * Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively.\n\n  * Attract a diverse range of contributors to our community to get involved and contribute to our goals.\n\n  * Build an environment conducive to our wider goals.\n\n  * Define the scope of each team, and help team members understand that scope.\n\n  * Understand the extent and range of collaboration between our teams.\n\n  * Encourage diversity and opportunity in the community.\n\n  * Produce a Code of Conduct.\n\nEvery community needs to cherish and respect deep-level diversity. Its\nimportance is not something that can be enforced with actions, bullet points,\nsuccess criteria, or other organizational devices. Leaders are responsible for\nmodeling the right behavior and encouraging it in others, but ultimately all\nmembers are responsible for remembering why your community is doing what it is\ndoing and standing shoulder to shoulder, connected by diversity to grow and\ntake on future challenges. It is diversity and this sense of united openness\nthat will keep your community strong and reactive to any obstacles in its way.\n\nIn the previous few pages we have explored some of the core aspects of\nbuilding community. We have learned that we need to take a cast of dots, bring\nthem together into teams, help them communicate, and create an environment\nthat is conducive to building strong community.\n\nThese essential elements of community are the primary goals that we want to\nachieve in our social economy. There are no specific actions or tasks that can\nachieve each of these elements; instead, they need to live in the woodwork of\nyour community. They are attributes that we should always strive for, both\nthroughout the rest of this book and throughout our future endeavors.\n\nNow it is time for us to change gears and delve into the specifics of exactly\nwhat you want to achieve in your community.\n\n# Designing Your Community\n\nAt the start of this chapter, I waxed lyrical about strategy. Unfortunately,\nmany community leaders consider strategy as an afterthought: they think of it\nas a nod toward the bureaucrats, not as something that actually helps their\ncommunity grow. This view is misplaced, because leaders _can_ maintain the\nflexibility they need while producing plans that can help structure and enable\nthe community. Indulge me....\n\nWhen your community kicks off, you’ll be way ahead if you can get down on\npaper its primary purpose and core goals. To do this you need 1 tablespoon of\naims, 1 mission statement, and 1 cup of objectives and goals; bake for 45\nminutes, and allow to cool. The result: a _strategic plan_.\n\n### Note\n\nThe strategic plan that we develop throughout this chapter is a hugely\nimportant tool if you are a company that is likely to hire a community\nmanager. We discuss this in more detail in [Chapter 13](ch13.html\n\"Chapter 13. Hiring a Community Manager\").\n\nTo get started, you first need to answer some simple yet broad questions.\nWrite down a single detailed sentence or a collection of single words that\nanswers the following:\n\nWhat is the mission?\n\n    \n\nWe want to understand our primary mission—the bright, shiny prize for which we\nencourage and inspire our community. What is this eventual outcome that we\nlust for? Is it a software release, political change, to help a demographic of\npeople, or to produce something?\n\nWhat are the opportunities and areas of collaboration?\n\n    \n\nWe want to explore how our community can work together to create and achieve\nthings. What are these areas? How can we work together in different ways?\n\nWhat are the skills required?\n\n    \n\nWe want to identify what skills we need in our community so that we can later\nestablish teams to house these skills. What are these skills?\n\nThese simple questions are the foundation of a more detailed set of objectives\nthat we will flesh out over the following pages. Let’s look at a few example\nanswers.\n\nEarlier in this book, we talked about the Jokosher audio production software\nproject that I kicked off from my mocked-up designs. The project is focused on\nproducing an easy-to-use application to record and mix audio. Let’s apply\nthese questions to Jokosher:\n\nMISSION: To produce an integrated audio production environment for the\npurposes of recording, mixing, and exporting audio built on the principles of\nease of use and simplicity, utilizing open source technology.  \n---  \nOPPORTUNITIES: Easing audio production, rethinking assumed knowledge, and\nasking questions in an integrated environment, and open and free access to\nsimple audio production technology.  \nAREAS OF COLLABORATION: Interface design, development, documentation,\ntranslations, testing.  \nSKILLS REQUIRED: Programming (audio, interface), documentation, web design,\nweb content, testing, bug triage, translations.  \n  \nNote how these answers have been structured. We have used a single, very\ndetailed, and carefully considered sentence for the “MISSION” and\n“OPPORTUNITIES,” and single words or short phrases for the other areas.\n\nNow spend some time thinking carefully about how you distill your answer to\nthe “MISSION.” Let’s delve into it in a little more detail:\n\nTo produce an integrated audio production environment for the purposes of\nrecording, mixing, and exporting audio built on the principles of ease of use\nand simplicity, utilizing open source technology.  \n---  \n  \nThis single sentence communicates all the key aims of the project:\n\n  * The kind of tool we wish to produce: audio production environment\n\n  * The primary functions of the tool: recording, mixing, and exporting audio\n\n  * The principles of the project: ease of use and simplicity\n\n  * The scope of its approach: using open source technology\n\nDistilling the broad goals of the project into a single sentence helps you to\nunderstand what you really want to achieve. It also gives you a great summary\nof the project that you can share within minutes. This is called the _elevator\npitch_ and is useful for attracting new contributors and spreading the word\nabout your community. More on this later.\n\nThe “OPPORTUNITIES” answer is the area in which you should identify all the\nexciting opportunities that are possible if you achieve your goals with the\ncommunity. Producing revolutionary software? Changing the quality of life for\nhomeless people in your neighborhood? Furthering a particular skill? Helping\nkids to eat healthy foods? Whatever your dreams, these should be the most\nimportant and inspiring opportunities that you are seeking. Remember, we are\nlooking for high-level, essential goals here.\n\nThe “AREAS OF COLLABORATION” answer is where you can note the areas in which\nthe community can _work together_ on a task. This could include writing\ndocumentation, organizing events, performing advocacy, writing software, etc.\nSome tasks in the project cannot or will not be collaborative (e.g.,\nadministering the infrastructure facilities for the community); you obviously\nshould not include these.\n\nThe “SKILLS REQUIRED” part is where you should note the skills that are\nrequired to make your mission a reality. What types of skills are needed to\nachieve those goals? Scribble down the full range of skills that you will\nneed. This explicit statement will be handy later when attracting\ncontributors.\n\nOur Jokosher example earlier was a very technical project focused on open\nsource software. Let’s explore another: a neighborhood watch community.\n\nMISSION: To build a sense of safety within the FooVille area of BarTown by\ncreating a sense of community, opening up communication, and building\noversight into daily lives.  \n---  \nOPPORTUNITIES: A safer neighborhood, fewer worries for kids playing outside,\nmore desirable living conditions, more attractive house-buying area, better\nsocial interaction between residents, improved relations with the police.  \nAREAS OF COLLABORATION: Organizing events, publicity, online discussion,\nsignage.  \nSKILLS REQUIRED: Event organization, design, web design, advocacy, writing.  \n  \nHere we focus on building a sense of safety in a specific region of a specific\ntown.\n\nGo ahead, write the “MISSION,” “OPPORTUNITIES,” “AREAS OF COLLABORATION,” and\n“SKILLS REQUIRED” for your community.\n\nWith a defined, core set of objectives and their characteristics noted, it is\nnow time to flesh them out into a mission statement and form the basis of our\nstrategy.\n\n## Baking in Openness\n\nAlways remember that, when building your community, transparency and openness\nare critical considerations. Few open volunteer communities succeed without\ntransparent methods and approaches. As such, you should be open and inclusive\nwith your community as you develop your strategy.\n\n### Note\n\nThroughout this book we talk about transparency and the best methods of\ngrowing it in your community. It is an important consideration in everything\nyou do, and it should be a top-level priority in how you work.\n\nYour role in building this strategy is in facilitating discussion and helping\nto bring conclusions from those discussions into a single strategic document.\nYou are not here to make decisions on your community’s behalf. You also are\nnot here to dictate direction and decisions. You are here to gather feedback,\nopinions, and ideas publicly and develop a strategy that meets as many needs\nand expectations in your community as possible.\n\nThere are many approaches to building a strategic document in an open and\ninclusive way, but here is my recommended approach:\n\n  * Have a central place in which the strategic documentation is developed. I recommend a website or wiki. Ensure that everyone in your community has access to this location.\n\n  * As you work through the concepts in this chapter, engage in public discussions with your community to make decisions. This could happen in face-to-face meetings or in online mediums, such as mailing lists and forums. Gather this feedback and use it as a basis for additions to the plan.\n\n  * Regularly update the documentation and solicit feedback from the wider community on your changes.\n\nThis approach ensures that you develop your strategic plan in an open and\ntransparent manner, and that the plan reflects the perspectives and desires of\nyour community. The key is regularity of communication and feedback, and a\ncentral document that brings it all together. If you approach your strategy in\nthis manner, your community will feel open and accessible.\n\nOne difficult aspect of this process is when people disagree on direction. You\nmay get some people who believe that Approach A makes sense and some who feel\nthat Approach B is more appropriate. Unfortunately, there is no easy solution\nto this problem.\n\nAn example of this problem occurred in a derivative distribution of Ubuntu\ncalled Xubuntu. The Xubuntu community took the underlying Ubuntu system and\nswapped out certain components to make it more lightweight and suitable for\nlower-powered computers. Some time ago, the community unfortunately hit\nsomething of a roadblock when deciding in which direction to move forward.\nThey not only disagreed on the direction of the project, but also disagreed on\nwho should coordinate the strategy.\n\nTo resolve this, I stepped in and scheduled a public online meeting and\ninvited the entire Xubuntu community to attend. My first goal was to focus on\nwhat the community agreed on. Much of the meeting consisted of gathering\neveryone’s feedback and collating the recurring themes into a broad, high-\nlevel direction. After 45 minutes or so of discussion, this was finalized as:\n\n> To produce an easy to use distribution, based on Ubuntu, using Xfce as the\n> graphical desktop, with a focus on integration, usability and performance,\n> with a particular focus on low memory footprint.\n>\n> The integration in Xubuntu is at a configuration level, a toolkit level, and\n> matching the underlying technology beneath the desktop in Ubuntu. Xubuntu\n> will be built and developed as part of the wider Ubuntu community, based\n> around the ideals and values of Ubuntu.\n\nI managed to converge on this statement by repeatedly refining it based on\nfeedback. This happened over and over again until we got something that\nvirtually everyone agreed on. This agreement is composed of two parts. The\nfirst provides a broad mission statement, and the second specifies a broad set\nof high-level goals that can implement that statement. This dynamic duo could\nthen be used to form the basis for an additional set of discussions to flesh\nout a full strategic plan.\n\nThe Importance Of Leadership\n\nAs this story highlights, leadership is a critical function in building an\neffective and fulfilling community. We will be discussing leadership\nthroughout this book, but always remember that leadership is a skill that is\nlearned, refined, and improved based on our own experiences and learning the\nlessons of others. As you work to grow your community management skills, also\nthink carefully how you can become a stronger, more effective, and more\nempathetic leader.\n\nFor this process to happen effectively, it needed a coordinator, and my next\njob was to get agreement on who this coordinator should be. The community was\nunited in recommending a competent and regular contributor in the form of one\nCody Somerville. Cody worked with the community using the approach I\nrecommended and produced a full strategic plan. The Xubuntu community went on\nto do some great work built around this strategy.\n\n## Building a Mission Statement\n\nIn the same way the Xubuntu community agreed on their high-level goals, a\nmission statement holds a lot of value for any kind of collaborative project,\nbe it a commercial product or a volunteer community. These statements\nemphasize the promise, opportunity, and definition of what your community is\nseeking to achieve. Their purpose is to articulate ambition with a detailed,\nsuccinct, and elegant approach. Mission statements help get everyone in your\ncommunity on the same page.\n\nMission statements are intended to be consistent and should rarely change,\neven if the tasks that achieve that mission change regularly. When building\nyour mission statement, always have its longevity in mind. Remember, your\nmission statement is your slam-dunking, audacious goal. For many communities\nthese missions can take decades or even longer to achieve. Their purpose is to\nnot only describe the finish line, but also help the community stay on track.\n\nMany of us are more than familiar with mission statements. They are one of the\nfirst documents we see when we join a new company. Unfortunately, staff\nmembers typically ignore them. These statements are usually written by senior\nmanagement and often bear no day-to-day resemblance to the work done by the\nfolks on the ground. Don’t use these often-pointless examples as a reason to\nconsider mission statements irrelevant: these companies are simply doing it\nwrong. The mission needs to be at the forefront of every member’s mind, and\nshould be a regular driving force that is the justification behind the day-to-\nday work. Your community members need to be able to draw a connection between\nthe daily work of the community and your mission.\n\nNow sit down and write your mission statement. Take the “MISSION” sentence\nthat you wrote down earlier, break it apart, and illustrate it using\ndescriptive, evocative, and stimulating words. Your mission should define the\npurpose of your aims, the bigger picture of where they fit in, and the\nuniqueness of your approach. You should expand on your “MISSION” while also\nusing your “OPPORTUNITIES,” “SKILLS,” and “AREAS OF COLLABORATION” for\ninspiration. Although there are no fixed guidelines for the size of a mission\nstatement, keep it detailed yet concise. If you exceed 300 words, you may be\nbabbling a little too much. This, my friends, is a babble-free zone.\n\nWhen you have completed the statement, you should run it through three\nrigorous tests:\n\nTest 1\n\n    \n\nPut yourself in the position of a potential community member. If you had no\nknowledge of the community or its goals, would the mission statement explain\nit all within a minute? With every sentence, you risk the reader getting bored\nand wandering off for a love affair with his PlayStation. If your mission\ndoesn’t deliver your aims quickly, efficiently, and compactly, go and improve\nit.\n\nTest 2\n\n    \n\nGet someone else to read it. Ask her to tell you what she thinks and how she\nperceives the aims of your community. Typically this person may be a friend,\nbut friends often skirt around criticism. Make sure your reader is encouraged\nto criticize where needed, and tell her you won’t get in a huff if she says\nsomething sucks. If she says something is unclear, fix it.\n\nTest 3\n\n    \n\nIs this mission statement going to inspire you and your members through the\ntoughest times of the community? In _Organizational Vision, Values and\nMission_ (Crisp Learning), Cynthia D. Scott et al. describe this perfectly: “A\nmission evokes a personal response. Work on it until it gets to be so clear\nthat reminding yourself of it will keep you, on a really bad day, from walking\nout and quitting.” Is your mission going to stop you from quitting when the\nworld has climbed onto your shoulders? One day this is going to happen, and\nyou need to be able to look at your mission statement and have “a moment.”\n\nWhen you have successfully navigated through these three tests, you should\nhave a rock-solid and rigorously tested mission. Our mission is our first\nguiding document for our community. We’ll use it now for the next step:\nbuilding our _strategic plan_.\n\n## Building a Strategic Plan\n\nThe purpose of a strategic plan is to document your goals and ambitions for a\ngiven period of time and to provide a central body of agreement in your\norganization or community. It should clarify what your objectives are and\nwhich goals are part of those objectives; it should also state how progress is\nmeasured and who is leading the work. A detailed, realistic strategic plan is\nhugely valuable for your community. Having a strategy does not mean that you\nhave bent to the gods of bureaucracy.\n\nA strategic plan is broken into objectives that we seek to achieve before a\ngiven milestone. This milestone can be measured in either time or a specific\nachievement. Your choice is entirely dependent on the type of community and\nproject you are involved in.\n\nAs an example, some software projects use fixed release cycles, such as Ubuntu\nwith its six-month cycle. Other software projects set their milestones as a\ngiven release that will have an agreed amount of functionality. Nonsoftware\ncommunities often use other kinds of metrics, such as an amount of money to\nraise in donations or a date when a particular event or initiative is\nlaunched.\n\nFixed Software Cycles\n\nMany of you reading the _The Art of Community_ will be seeking to apply these\nprinciples to open source software development. With this in mind, here are a\nfew more words on the merits of fixed release cycles versus the release-when-\nready approach.\n\nFixed release cycles offer many benefits to your users and developers:\n\n  * They’re predictable and reliable. Your users know when every release will happen.\n\n  * It’s easier to break the cycle into parts. When the cycle is fixed in length each time, you can divide it into the requisite parts (development, translations, UI freeze, hard freeze, release candidate, etc.) more easily.\n\n  * Particularly for open source projects, fixed release cycles make it easier for distributions to factor your release into their road map. This happens with the GNOME and Ubuntu projects, for example.\n\nThere is, however, one distinctive disadvantage with a fixed cycle: it makes\nit harder to develop large new features and changes that take longer than the\nduration of the cycle to implement. This is something we discovered in the\nUbuntu community. Planning longer-term features sometimes needs to be broken\ninto chunks and spread across release cycles. Interestingly, breaking the\nproblem into chunks is often a better approach, regardless of release cycles.\n\nRelease cycles are fairly serious beasts. Fortunately, they lead to more fun\nand exciting prospects: our goals. When you hit these goals, you should let\nyour hair down and celebrate, and when this occurs regularly, it reaffirms a\nstrong sense of community and teamwork by acknowledging that you have all been\nworking your socks off toward your goals. We discuss methods of celebrating\nreleases in [Chapter 12](ch12.html \"Chapter 12. Creating and Running Events\").\n\nYou should think carefully about what kind of milestone you want to apply to\nyour project. It is far better to choose a milestone that is six months away\nand achieve less than it is to pick a milestone that is two years away and\nachieve more. Regular milestone achievements give your community a much-needed\ndose of excitement and satisfaction.\n\nChoose your milestones now (e.g., using a fixed cycle, a given set of\nfeatures, a given date, or some other indicator of completion).\n\n### Structuring the plan\n\nWith your milestones decided, you can focus on the structure of the strategic\nplan. We will familiarize ourselves with this structure and then begin\ndiscussing how we can identify the objectives and goals to fill it. Before we\nbegin, you should remember to fulfill your role as a facilitator and work with\nyour community in a transparent fashion to combine input, feedback, and\nopinion into a single consistent plan that everyone can follow.\n\nThere are many, many ways of structuring a strategic plan. Everyone has his\nown approach, and countless books have been written on the subject. The\ntechnique that I am going to use here is one that I have found particularly\neffective for the communities that I have been involved in. Unfortunately,\nmany of the books written about strategic design and planning are written with\nbusinesses in mind, and some aspects of business strategic planning are\nunsuitable for community strategy.\n\nThis is because business strategic planning typically presumes an\norganizational structure that provides a more central decision-making\nfunction: it is always clear who has the authority and expectation to make\ndecisions. Ironically, this perspective is becoming increasingly old-school in\nbusiness circles, with many businesses focusing on a more community-oriented\ncollaborative planning approach that helps foster deeper team commitment even\nwhen there’s a central position of responsibility (not authority).\n\nThe challenge here is that there is no cut-and-dried path to community, and\nthe same applies to your strategic planning. As you grow and build your\ncommunity, you should feel free to experiment, explore, and refine the\napproach we use here. You should develop a strategic plan that works for you\nand your specific community.\n\nOur approach here involves defining a number of _objectives_. These are the\nbroad, high-level things that you want to achieve. Each objective is divided\ninto a number of _goals_. Each goal includes three pieces of information.\n\n  * The _success criteria_ describe a set of measurable methods for evaluating the goal’s success. You should be able to look at this statement and determine straightaway whether the goal was achieved (example: 20 new community members).\n\n  * The _implementation plan_ describes what tasks need to happen to achieve the goal. These are a set of directions that clearly indicate the steps involved in achieving the goal.\n\n  * Finally, and this is optional with many communities, we specify the _owner_ : the person responsible for the goal. Accountability is an important element in building successful community: when people feel responsible for their work, they ensure that positive outcomes are generated.\n\nYour plan should not live in isolation. Its final home really shouldn’t be a\npiece of paper in your office drawer or a random document on your computer. It\nshould be shared. It should be read. It should become a core document in your\ncommunity.\n\nTo make the plan easy to read, I recommend that you structure each objective\nand its goals in a consistent manner. Let’s look at an example of an objective\nand one of its goals (remember that most objectives will have many goals):\n\n  * OBJECTIVE: Build a website for the project.\n\n  * GOAL: Build a structural design for the website content.\n\n  * SUCCESS CRITERIA:\n\n    * All areas of the website structure documented in a specification.\n\n    * Community feedback gathered on the proposal.\n\n  * IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n\n    * Identify the needs of the website by liaising with the community.\n\n    * Document the structure of the website on the wiki.\n\n    * Email the core community team with feedback and merge feedback in.\n\n    * Organize an online meeting to propose any changes to the specification.\n\n    * Build a prototype.\n\n  * OWNER: Jono Bacon.\n\nThis example demonstrates a number of subtle points in building a\ncomprehensive strategic plan:\n\n  * The OBJECTIVE should be a specific outcome that you would like to achieve. These should be high-level (such as “Build a website for the project”) but not too fluffy (such as “Make everyone feel warm and fuzzy”).\n\n  * Each objective can have a number of GOALS, and each goal should have SUCCESS CRITERIA, IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, and (where appropriate) OWNER items.\n\n  * The SUCCESS CRITERIA should be a set of measurable assessment methods. You should be able to look at each SUCCESS CRITERIA point and definitively know whether it was achieved. Each item should clearly state what needs to be achieved to be considered complete. Avoid vague and general statements; instead, use specifics. Success criteria help the wider community reach a consensus on what constitutes success and identify when progress is being made.\n\n  * The IMPLEMENTATION PLAN is a set of reasonably granular steps that indicate how you can achieve the goal.\n\n  * In some cases it makes sense to assign an OWNER to a goal, even if that owner merely has oversight in getting it done. OWNER does not necessarily map to responsibility for the goal in a community, although it typically does in the business world.\n\nWith this consistent structure across your plan, you will be able to\neffectively document the broad objectives and specific goals and measure and\nevaluate progress on your action points. Now let us use this structure to add\nsome meat to the bones.\n\n# Filling Out the Plan\n\nWith a mission statement, strategic plan structure, and some notes about our\naims, we have already made some great progress in getting organized. Many\ncommunities are built on vague ideas that are barely communicated and shared,\nand progress is scattershot. Their approach is often uncoordinated and without\nschedule. Our work so far already has our community off to a rocking start.\n\nBut the devil is in the details. We need to use our structure here to flesh\nout what we want to achieve in our mission statement. We need to take our\nmission; combine it with our notes about opportunities; and produce a set of\nobjectives, goals, success criteria, and implementation plan items.\n\nUnfortunately, in terms of your community I have no idea what you specifically\nwant to achieve. Some of you will be working on software projects. Some of you\nwill be setting up user groups. Some of you will be traveling to far-flung\nlands to help poor children. I cannot directly choose your specific objectives\nand goals, but I can advise you on _how_ to choose them.\n\nFirst, take your mission statement and pick it apart. Now use the high-level\naims as a source of discussion for brainstorming sessions. We need to flesh\nout, discuss, and debate our ideas and their implications and requirements.\nThese sessions will generate this set of ideas that you can merge into the\nstrategic plan.\n\n## Brainstorming Ideas\n\nThe justification for collaborative brainstorming is twofold. First, no matter\nhow intelligent you are or how worldly you consider yourself, collaborative\nbrainstorming _always_ uncovers new ideas, concepts, problems, and techniques\nthat you never considered. This is hugely valuable. Second, collaborative\nbrainstorming is an important step in building transparency and openness in\nyour community. This sense of openness is critical at every step, including\nstrategic development.\n\nGetting people together to share ideas and opinions should be exhilarating. It\nshould open everyone’s mind to flow in an environment that encourages the\nexpression of ideas. Great brainstorming sessions inspire their participants:\nmembers feel not only that they can contribute, but also that they can control\nthe implementation of the very ideas they propose. Unfortunately, many\nbrainstorming sessions don’t quite work that way.\n\nMany sessions comprise one driving force (the leader of the session) moving\nthe discussion forward, backed up by a core group of two or three primary\ncontributors. The rest of the group often sit in silence, observing the melee\naround them. Many of the ideas from these sessions are often plain and\nobvious; they fail to uncover core opportunities and issues.\n\nFortunately, great brainstorming sessions have a core formula:\n\nDefine a purpose\n\n    \n\nYour session should have an aim, a goal, and a purpose. What do you want to\nachieve in the session? What outcomes would you like to generate? Would you\nlike ideas, work assignments, or other elements? Make sure each of your\nparticipants is aware of the session’s aim. Remember, an important source of\nfocus for your sessions should be the objectives of your mission statement.\n\nOrganize and invite your participants\n\n    \n\nMake sure the people you want in the session know about it and can attend. If\nthe session is online, be conscious of time zone issues. Allocate enough time\nto run the session. Usually 1–2 hours is enough time without boring the pants\noff people.\n\nGet your resources in place\n\n    \n\nIf your session is face-to-face, make sure you have somewhere to jot down\nideas. A whiteboard or flip pad is a great resource for this. If the session\nis online, a wiki or note-taker is a great option. Another great option here\nis a collaborative text editor, such as the freely available\n[Gobby](http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/).\n\nSet some ground rules\n\n    \n\nMake it clear that everyone is encouraged to participate. Also make it clear\nthat offensive discussion and nonconstructive criticism should be avoided.\nIdeas should be expressed in high-level detail, but not discussed in overly\nspecific detail due to time constraints.\n\nHelp people relax\n\n    \n\nFor many people, a brainstorming session is a social nightmare. Try to make\nthe atmosphere as loose and informal as possible.\n\nWith this recipe in place, we can explore some methods of generating the best\nideas from the session.\n\n### Technique 1: Question assumptions\n\nWith every brainstorming session, there is a set of assumptions and perceived\nnorms. Your first point of order should be to tear open those norms and\nquestion whether they are effective. If they are not, the road is open to\nalternatives.\n\nIf your session is about improving ease of use in your software, is your\ncurrent design the best approach? If you are discussing how to lower crime in\nyour area, consider your assumptions: is it as bad as you think? If you want\nto bring more people to your community, does your target audience read and\nreside in the areas you think they do? Questioning assumptions can often\nuncover some great talking points and areas of investigation.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of questioning the norms, it is also healthy to\nregularly question your own perspective and approaches. As a community leader,\npeople look to you for guidance. It is hugely valuable to regularly sit back\nand reconsider the approaches that you ordinarily take for granted.\n\nIt might sound a little unusual, but I personally conduct a performance review\nof myself twice a year. In it, I ask my community for feedback on my approach,\nlanguage, productivity, responsiveness, and other aspects of my work. On many\noccasions this review has helped me uncover some great areas in which to\nimprove how I work with my own communities. I recommend you do the same.\n\n### Technique 2: Think outside the box\n\nWhile we are all wrapped up in self-reflective thought, you should also\nquestion what you could achieve if you let your imagination run loose. What\nare the subconscious limitations that you are placing on yourself when\nthinking of ideas? In other words, if all the barriers are removed, what is\npossible?\n\nA great example of this is the Nintendo Wii game console. For years, console\nafter console had shipped with a control pad that players used to control the\non-screen characters. These pads went through many variations, but they all\nshared one common characteristic: the buttons controlled the action.\n\nOf course, there were attempts at alternatives: light guns, dance mats,\nplastic guitars and drums. Most still had the assumed knowledge that the\nplayer controlled the action by pressing buttons. These alternative approaches\nwere never a core part of the systems. They were novelty add-ons that often\nhad limited appeal.\n\nThe Wii changed all of that. Shigeru Miyamoto, a renowned video game designer\nand cocreator of many games, including Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, and\nThe Legend of Zelda, sat down with other designers and questioned whether they\nshould be limited to the existing norms of the game interface.\n\nThe result was one of the most significant developments in video game history:\nthe Wii Remote, which allowed gamers to control the action by moving the unit\nitself. This enabled all manner of physical interactions, from 10-pin bowling\nto boxing to ski-jumping. The Wii changed how we think about video games, and\nis clearly having an effect on the design of other consumer products as well.\n\nThinking outside the box takes time and focus to master. The trick is in\nquestioning everything around you. A great exercise for this is to spend an\nhour noticing the details in your world and questioning why they work the way\nthey do. Try to find faults. Try to find justification for the way things are.\nImportantly, when you ask these questions, try to think of solutions. If you\nquestion why the heater control in your car is labeled the way it is, what\nwould be a better label? If you question why you always need to pay your rent\ncheck manually, how could it be automated for both you and your landlord?\nThese are great opportunities to enjoy being a cantankerous consumer but with\nthe added benefit of expanding your own problem-solving skills. Meaningless\nbuzzword fans may want to refer to this as _Cantankerized Consumer Problem\nAssessment_ (CCPA).\n\n### Technique 3: Let’s make it suck\n\nA great technique for questioning everything and uncovering new ideas is one\nthat I tried first at the Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS) in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, in early 2008. The idea is simple: reverse the aims of what you\nwant to achieve.\n\nAs an example, imagine you wanted to design a cell phone. Traditionally, you\nwould brainstorm the attributes of a great cell phone. Instead, turn\neverything on its head. What would make the worst possible cell phone? Maybe\nit ignores all calls? Or maybe it only accepts calls from telemarketing\ncompanies? Maybe the buttons are too small? How about really short battery\nlife?\n\nWhen you ask these kinds of questions in a brainstorming session, it almost\nalways breaks the ice and gets people talking. Such ridiculous questions\ngenerate a lot of fun discussion, laughter, and ludicrous ideas. Make sure you\nwrite down every one of these nuggets of madness.\n\nAfter your group has exhausted their initial pool of ideas, you should invert\neach idea again. How do we make sure that our phone accepts all calls? How can\nit avoid calls from telemarketing companies? How can we make sure the buttons\nare the right size and not too small? How can we improve battery life?\n\nAside from the benefits of getting your group brainstorming, this approach is\nan excellent method in building defenses against the infuriation of normal\nlife. It helps to identify frustrating attributes and protect against them,\nand this will in turn provide better results. I have used this technique for\nbrainstorming websites, processes, products, and more, and it has always been\nfun, productive, and useful.\n\n# Pulling Together the Threads\n\nAt this point in our journey into the depths of strategy you have four very\nimportant assets. Each of these was developed from our structured approach to\nthinking throughout the chapter:\n\n  * A set of TODO list items: essential concepts that are important throughout all aspects of your community building\n\n  * An initial set of MISSION, OPPORTUNITIES, AREAS OF COLLABORATION, and SKILLS REQUIRED notes that flesh out a set of aims for your community\n\n  * A more complete mission statement that helps determine high-level goals and ambitions and serves as a source of inspiration for brainstorming\n\n  * A set of ideas generated from your brainstorming sessions\n\nOur task is now to convert these assets into a strategic plan structure that\ncan be shared with the rest of your community.\n\nFirst, produce a set of objectives from the high-level goals in your mission\nstatement and the list of ideas from your brainstorming sessions. Create\nobjectives that you feel you can achieve within a reasonable time frame.\nAgain, the choice of time frame is dependent on your project, but I would\nrecommend it not exceed 6–12 months.\n\nNow put this list of objectives into the strategic plan and apply the\nconsistent structure we discussed earlier. Here is a quick recap of this\nstructure:\n\n  * OBJECTIVE:\n\n  * GOAL:\n\n  * SUCCESS CRITERIA:\n\n    * Item\n\n    * Item\n\n  * IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n\n    * Item\n\n    * Item\n\n  * OWNER:\n\n  * GOAL:\n\n  * SUCCESS CRITERIA:\n\n    * Item\n\n    * Item\n\n  * IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n\n    * Item\n\n    * Item\n\n  * OWNER:\n\nFor each objective that you have decided on, divide it into goals and assign\neach the SUCCESS CRITERIA, IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, and (optionally) OWNER items.\nYou should now go and flesh out each of these items for each of your goals.\n\nLet’s now take a look at our TODO list.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Identify how we can divide our community into teams.\n\n  * Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively.\n\n  * Attract a diverse range of contributors to our community to get involved and contribute to our goals.\n\n  * Build an environment conducive to our wider goals.\n\n  * Define the scope of each team, and help team members understand that scope.\n\n  * Understand the extent and range of collaboration between our teams.\n\n  * Encourage diversity and opportunity in the community.\n\n  * Produce a Code of Conduct.\n\nEach item on this list is critical in building a strong, proactive, effective\ncommunity. They are all important attributes that need attention when building\na healthy environment for our contributors.\n\nSome of these items are discussed later in this book. We will defer discussion\nof how to “build an environment conducive to our wider goals” and “encourage\ndiversity and opportunity in the community” until our chapters on processes\n([Chapter 4](ch04.html \"Chapter 4. Processes: Simple Is Sustainable\")) and\nbuilding buzz ([Chapter 7](ch07.html \"Chapter 7. Building Buzz\")),\nrespectively.\n\nWe have already added “produce a Code of Conduct” to our list of objectives.\nThis leaves us with some outstanding TODO list items, all of which relate to\ndividing our community into teams.\n\n## Teams: Divide and Conquer\n\nEarlier in this chapter, we rambled on about the importance of teams. We\nexplored how meritocracy, diversity, and working together can help us build\nthese units of belonging.\n\nSince that discussion, we have identified a set of objectives, each with\nrelated goals. It is now time to divide our community into a set of healthy,\nmotivated teams.\n\nAlthough we are going to strategically develop a set of teams to form our\ncommunity, you should encourage free-form team creation. Giving your community\nthe ability to build its own teams without prior approval can produce\nincredibly diverse and productive results. We have seen this in droves in the\nUbuntu community, with many seemingly random teams doing great work in areas\nwe never envisaged.\n\nAlthough the door should be open to form new teams, a primary set of teams\nwill perform much of the work in the community. Our four remaining Community\nTODO List items provide a set of guidelines for forming these core teams.\n\n### Identify how we can divide our community into teams\n\nEarlier in this chapter we fleshed out some initial notes about our community\nand what general considerations we think about in terms of a mission, skills,\nand objectives. If you followed my advice earlier, you will have worked in an\nopen and transparent manner with your community to flesh out this direction\ninto a strategic plan. Your objectives and the work necessary to achieve them\nshould be no surprise to your primary community members who were involved in\nconstructing this strategy. To achieve our strategic goals, we need to form\nthese teams that are so important to our community.\n\nThere are many approaches to setting up teams, and there is no standard recipe\nfor how to do this. It varies among different types of community, and it\nvaries among the experience and expectations of your existing members. When\ndeciding on teams, consult again with your existing community. Have a\ndiscussion about which teams make sense. You can’t build teams out of nothing,\nand as such, your first set of teams will almost certainly map to regularly\ncontributing community members who want to engage in certain types of work. As\nan example, if you have contributors who want to work on documentation, they\nwould be a great foundation for a documentation team.\n\nWhen most communities set up teams, the approach is almost always based on\nwhat similar communities have done. As an example, most open source projects\nwill have development, documentation, and translation teams. This is largely\nbecause these teams are what we are familiar with in those communities. I\nhighly recommend that you look into these existing communities and learn from\ntheir approach. This can offer valuable insight about the most suitable\nsolution for you.\n\nFor most communities, it seems that teams typically map very well to primary\nskills. Earlier on when we built our initial notes about our community, we\ncreated our own list of these SKILLS REQUIRED. Many of these skills often map\nwell to teams.\n\nAs an example, a software project will typically require these skills:\n\n  * Programming\n\n  * Writing documentation\n\n  * Testing\n\n  * Bug triage\n\n  * Advocacy\n\n  * Website development\n\nEach of these skills could map to the following teams:\n\n  * Programming→Development Team\n\n  * Writing documentation→Documentation Team\n\n  * Testing→QA Team\n\n  * Bug triage→QA Team\n\n  * Advocacy→Marketing Team\n\n  * Website development→Web Team\n\nSome skills (such as testing and bug triage) naturally map to the same teams.\nThis is perfectly normal, and should be encouraged. Although you want to\nensure that a good range of teams cover the different types of contributions,\nyou don’t want to overload your community. Form new teams only when existing\nteams cannot sufficiently cater to new needs and requirements.\n\nIt is important that your teams have the ability to expand their mandate,\nadjusting their focus as they mature. As an example, a documentation team may\nexpand to include general communications and education. As such, try to\nforesee this growth while keeping the team focused.\n\n### Define the scope of each team, and help team members understand that scope\n\nEarlier we created a mission statement for the wider community, but mission\nstatements can be useful for specific teams, too.\n\nFor each team you should produce a mission statement that outlines the\nspecific work that the team performs. With this statement available for each\nteam, you will better understand how your teams fit together, and so will\nprospective contributors: this statement will help you articulate the purpose\nof the team and help new contributors know which team to join.\n\nAs before, your definition should explain the typical activities that the team\nwill do. As an example, the following could be used to describe a\ndocumentation team:\n\n> The documentation team identifies and prioritizes areas in which\n> documentation is required, builds processes for producing high-quality\n> documentation and best practice, and produces said documentation.\n\nAs a continued effort in transparency and openness, when writing team mission\nstatements I recommend that you work together with other members of your\ncommunity who are on those teams, in order to come to an agreement on them.\n\n### Understand the extent and range of collaboration among our teams\n\nTeams are not insulated from one another. Every team needs to work with other\nteams, and some will have more crossover than others. Identify how your teams\nwill interact in different ways, and try to optimize for those teams that\ncross over the most.\n\nIdentifying these collaborative crossovers typically requires a significant\namount of day-to-day experience in how the community functions. With this in\nmind, you should regularly observe how your community’s teams collaborate.\n\nFor example, in the Ubuntu community, the bug squad (who triages and organizes\nbugs) works very closely with the development team. By observing how the teams\nwork, we were able to optimize the lines of communication, how both teams work\ntogether on the bug list, how meetings and events intersect, and other\ninitiatives.\n\n### Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively\n\nYou should always be cognizant of how your teams communicate with one another.\nHow can the documentation team communicate effectively with the marketing\nteam? How can the QA team work well with the development team?\n\nThe answer to these questions is complex and multifaceted. My recommended\napproach is to identify how you communicate tasks, issues, and goodwill:\n\nTasks\n\n    \n\nEnable teams to share and report what they are working on. When teams are able\nto identify who is working on what, this avoids duplication and confusion.\nGreat approaches to this are regular meetings, notes, and articles (such as\nblog entries). This will be discussed in more detail later in this book, when\nwe refine our communication facilities and processes.\n\nIssues\n\n    \n\nHave regular, open opportunities for teams to communicate. Every team will\nhave questions, concerns, queries, opportunities, and other topics to\ncommunicate to other teams. We need to ensure that these lines of\ncommunication are open. Again, regular, published meetings are the perfect\nopportunity to cover these kinds of issues.\n\nGoodwill\n\n    \n\nEncourage and inspire strong and positive relations between teams. Always\nremember that your teams are part of the same mission. As such, they should\ncelebrate victories together and console one another in hard times. If you\ndon’t focus enough on ensuring that teams feel part of the same machine\nworking together in the right direction, the community will feel fragmented.\nThis all boils down to bonding. Different teams should regularly bond\ntogether, either online, at physical meetings, and/or during other occasions.\nWe will discuss this in more detail in [Chapter 12](ch12.html\n\"Chapter 12. Creating and Running Events\"), when we discuss events. In the\nUbuntu community, this occurs at every Ubuntu Developer Summit: different\nteams bond together, which helps the project as a whole.\n\nAs mentioned, we can achieve each of these methods of communication by\nproducing a set of processes and events that every team makes use of.\nReporting can help with tasks, regular meetings can help with issues, and\nsocial interaction and bonding can help with goodwill. We will talk later in\nthis book about these different elements and how to implement them.\n\nSetting expectations is critical in building community. When expectations are\nunrealistic or misaligned, the community forms its own theories. This can be a\nrocky road. The problem is that of Chinese Whispers (also known as Telephone,\nto some)—the game where a message passes from one person to another and\nchanges at each step until the original meaning is garbled. When an\nexpectation is surprising, often guesses and assumption are communicated as\nfact. This causes misinformation, concern, and typically negative outcomes.\n\nThe goal of this chapter is partly to clearly define these expectations. Your\nstrategy is a means to get everyone in your community on the same page. If\naspects of the strategy are unclear, there is the potential for mismatched\nexpectations.\n\nAgain, this is an area in which experience plays a valuable role. After a\nshort time working with your community, you will begin to better understand\nhow they and you perceive the work that your community performs. This\nunderstanding will help you build a better strategy that will be more\neffective in achieving your objectives and goals.\n\n# Documenting Your Strategy\n\nBy now, a number of chunks of our strategy are in place. These include:\n\n  * A mission statement\n\n  * A set of objectives and goals, each with success criteria, an implementation plan, and owner details\n\n  * A list of skills and how those skills map to teams\n\n  * A list of teams, each with a definition of its scope\n\n  * A set of TODO list items that we can utilize throughout our community-building activities\n\nOur final task in this chapter is to put the fruits of our labor somewhere\nthat is accessible, easy to read, and easy to update. We need to communicate\nour strategy with the wider community and ensure that it can be referenced and\nupdated when required.\n\nAt a bare minimum, your strategy should be available online, and at least\navailable in the most common language that your community speaks. Multiple\nlanguages would be beneficial under the condition that every translation\ncovers the full strategic documentation. Half-complete translations are not\nuseful to anyone; the strategy must be complete.\n\nThe strategy that you publish should be made available in full and should not\nomit any sections. The purpose of this strategy is to unite the community\nbehind one set of documentation and to form agreement around the objectives\nand goals outlined in that documentation.\n\nThere are a number of options available when it comes to publishing online,\nfrom a simple web page to a full content management system. The specifics of\nhow you put your strategy online generally are not important; instead, open\naccess to the content is the primary focus.\n\nMany communities are using wikis as a method of publishing strategy online. A\nwiki is a website whose content anyone can update, the most significant\nexample being [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org). The idea is simple: a\ncommunity sets up a wiki to use as a general area for collaboration, and so it\nmakes sense to put the strategic plan on there.\n\nWith anyone able to edit the content on a wiki, your community needs to decide\nhow changes to this content are handled. You may welcome cosmetic changes such\nas spelling and grammar, but you should discourage random changes to the core\nagreement that is your strategic plan. Remember, the devil is in the details\nin strategic documents. To handle the tension between maintaining continuity\nand allowing fresh input, you have several options, some of which include:\n\n  * Putting up the strategic plan as a static web page that changes only after a rigorous process of internal discussion and voting. New goals and other changes can be emailed to project leaders or brought up in meetings.\n\n  * Putting up the mission statement and other rarely changing documents as a web page, but using a wiki or other malleable document for objectives and goals, so they can be rapidly updated by anyone involved.\n\n  * Putting everything on a wiki, but making sure you subscribe to all changes through email, an RSS feed, or whatever other medium on which you like to receive news.\n\nOther options will certainly arise as new online mediums are developed.\n\nWhichever approach you take, if the ability to change content is restricted,\nyou need to be able to justify why those who have access do and why others\ndon’t. “I created the content” is not enough of a justification.\n\nWhen some members of your community are given elevated responsibilities and\nprivilege, it automatically puts a hierarchy in place in your community. The\noutcome is that those with this access are seen as leaders and governors. The\nproduction and development of these strategic documents is part of the\nresponsibility of governing the community, and as such this governance may\nneed to be formalized into a recognized body, such as a Community Council. We\nwill discuss governance in detail later, in [Chapter 10](ch10.html\n\"Chapter 10. Governance\") of this book.\n\nAs a final note, always remember that documentation and strategy do not solve\nevery problem. Many people will be unaware that your strategy exists, and many\nwho are aware will simply not read it. A strong and well-documented strategy\ndoes not replace the culture of communication and unity that we seek to grow\nthroughout this book.\n\n# Financially Supporting Your Community\n\nAnother consideration to think about when planning your community is the level\nof financial resources you are going to need to operate.\n\nFor some communities this will be negligible. As an example, if you are\nrunning a local book club that meets once a week in a coffee shop, most of the\ncosts (e.g., gas for your members to get to the meetings) is likely to be\nabsorbed by the members themselves. Other communities may have more extensive\nfinancial requirements. As an example, a community that is creating software\nfor a particular device will likely need financial support to purchase the\nhardware so that the community can do their work.\n\nThe first question you should ask yourself is, What equipment and facilities\nare _required_ for the community to be successful? Now, when I say _required_\n, I really do mean _required_. There are lots of things that would be nice to\nhave—branded underwear, therapeutic spa sessions for hard-working\ncontributors, ivory back-scratchers—but we are talking about the essentials\nhere.\n\nHere some possible requirements to think about:\n\nInfrastructure\n\n    \n\nWhat resources do you need in order to do your work and represent the project?\nFortunately, in terms of online resources such as web or code/bug/translation\nhosting for software projects, there are many free services available that you\ncan use. There are also many services available for creating and hosting\nwebsites (many of which can be set up with a few clicks and no coding\nexperience). You should also assess which commercial services or\ninfrastructure you may require that have no free alternatives. Also remember\nthat one of the benefits of free services over most commercial services is\nthat your community members can use them freely, too; we always want our\ncommunity members to be able to participate without reaching into their\npockets.\n\nEquipment\n\n    \n\nWhat equipment is required for participation that would be unreasonable to\nexpect a community member to possess? As an example, for a software community\nwe can reasonably expect our community members to have a computer and Internet\naccess (we should not pay for these from the community organization’s\npockets). Continuing the example, custom hardware may have to be loaned to a\ncommunity member for him to do his work. For local communities other\nequipment, such as tools and materials for a DIY group or facilities for a\nmusic group, may be required.\n\nTravel\n\n    \n\nOne of the most common costs in communities is travel; this can be difficult\nto do on a shoestring, but it is possible. Before you decide you need a travel\nbudget, you should assess whether you can be represented at the event by\nasking friends for help (e.g., asking community members local to the event to\nattend).\n\nEvents\n\n    \n\nOf course, you may want to put on your own events and feel you need funds to\neither run the event and/or fund travel and accommodation for some of your\ncommunity members. Events can be expensive to run, but it is possible to do a\nlot with a little money.\n\nYou should put together this list of requirements and ask for feedback from\nother community members to see if they feel like it represents the community’s\nneeds accurately. You can then use this as a requirements list to outline\nthings for which you need to find funding.\n\nBefore we talk about potential areas of revenue, I strongly encourage you to\ntry to satisfy these requirements in a _grassroots_ kind of way. As an\nexample, each year I organize the Community Leadership Summit (you can read\nmore about the event in [The Community Leadership\nSummit](ch15.html#community_leadership_summit \"The Community Leadership\nSummit\")). While the event definitely requires some funding (as an example, we\nare required to purchase the coffee from the conference center vendor, and\nthis is heavily marked up and costs around $3,000), we also try to run the\nrest of the event in a very cost-efficient way. We have volunteers who staff\nit, we are loaned much of the equipment, the venue space is donated, and other\nareas are handled in a very communal fashion.\n\nThere are two reasons why I strongly encourage you to think creatively about\nhow you can satisfy these requirements:\n\nAsking friends is easier than asking strangers\n\n    \n\nAsking friends, colleagues, and community members to loan equipment,\ncontribute time, and volunteer in other ways is much easier than asking\nsomeone for money to pay for these things. In tough economic climates it is\nincreasingly difficult to have people pledge money to communities.\n\nLess paperwork is a good thing\n\n    \n\nAs soon as you bring money into your community you then have to engage in all\nthe paperwork and policy that surrounds it. This includes accounts, taxes,\nsetting up foundations (if applicable), and other such fluff and nonsense. I\ndon’t know if I am in the minority here, but I _hate_ this kind of work, and\nit sucks the fun out of working with community. If you can avoid handling\nmoney and thus avoid the paperwork this can often make life much easier.\n\nThe general rule of thumb I recommend is to run your community in as\ngrassroots a way as possible and then get funding for the areas that you can’t\nsupport in this way.\n\n## Revenue Opportunities\n\nIf you do decide that you need to find some money to cover the requirements\nyou outlined earlier for your community, there are a number of different\noptions available. Fortunately, setting up and delivering these options is\nfairly straightforward. Let’s look into each of them.\n\n### Online advertising\n\nEveryone hates ads, right? Why would I want to return to the 1998 era of\nbanner ads obnoxiously draped across my community’s website?\n\nWell, fortunately it is not as bad as that. In recent years online advertising\nhas become a valuable service that not only provides a revenue opportunity for\ncommunities (as well as individuals, businesses, and anyone else), but also\nhas been tuned to better integrate these ads into websites and to display ads\nthat are relevant to your visitors.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the big player in online advertising is Google\nwith its AdSense service. The concept is pretty simple: when you sign up for\nthe service Google provides a small chunk of code that you embed into your\nwebsite that will read in the content on each page and display ads that are\nrelevant to that page. As an example, if you write a blog entry about horses,\nyou will likely see equestrian-related ads.\n\nEach time someone clicks on the ad, the company that placed the ad will pay a\nsmall fee to you and to Google. This fee is calculated using some kind of\nmystical formula that you can learn about elsewhere, but the practical result\nis that when you display ads and people click on them you get paid.\n\nWhat is nice about the AdSense service is that you can choose different ways\nin which the ads are displayed (e.g., different sized ad blocks, different\nnumbers of ads, whether images or just text links are displayed, etc.). Using\nthe service is really simple; just sign up at\n<https://www.google.com/adsense/>.\n\nAnother nice feature specific to AdSense is that you can provide ads on your\nYouTube videos. This opens up another channel in which revenue could be\ngenerated, and if you have a viral video on your hands, you can cash in on\nquite a chunk of change.\n\n### Selling\n\nAnother avenue for generating money is to sell items at a profit. Examples of\nthis could include selling branded t-shirts, mugs, and other merchandise. Many\ncommunities have used this approach with varying levels of success.\n\nThe first step in using this method is to think about what you could sell.\nBrainstorm a list of potential items and then prioritize that list into the\nkind of things that people might actually want to purchase. Much as a thong\nwith your logo on it might sound cool, is anyone really going to want that\n(apart from you)?\n\nWhen you have this list you can look at different supplier options.\n\nMany of you will be interested in producing wearables (e.g., t-shirts,\nhoodies, caps, vests) and promo items (e.g., mugs, stickers, key chains,\netc.). For these kinds of products you have two broad options:\n\nBulk production\n\n    \n\nYou could choose an item (such as a t-shirt) and bulk-produce it, such as\ngetting 300 made. This is by far the cheapest approach, and the higher the\nquantity the more the cost per unit goes down. The problem with this approach\nis that you will need to fund this up front, you will have stock to get rid\nof, and you will need to fulfill the orders (package them up and send them\nout). You will also need to be able to handle payments (although this is not\nthat challenging when using a service such as\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com)).\n\nOn-demand production\n\n    \n\nAn alternative approach is to use a service such as\n[CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com),\n[Spreadshirt](http://www.spreadshirt.com), or [Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com)\nto create an online store, upload your logos, and then have people purchase\ntheir items from there. Each item will be made on a one-by-one basis, and\nunfortunately this means the price for these items is often much higher. The\nbenefits are that these companies will handle all the production, sales, and\nfulfillment, and there are no up-front costs or stock required.\n\nBoth of these approaches can work well for different communities. The former\nis definitely the most cost-effective in terms of making profit on the items\nyou sell, but the latter is definitely more convenient. Unfortunately, for the\nlatter I have traditionally found it harder to sell items than with the former\napproach.\n\n### Donations\n\nSevered Fifth is a project that I set up to see how far a band could take its\nmusic by giving the music away and building a community around the band that\ncould help grow and support the band in different ways. I set up the band,\nwrote an album, and recorded a demo in my home studio, and then we started a\ncampaign to raise funds to record an album professionally.\n\nWhat started next was a busy period of blogging, releasing videos, and raising\nawareness around the goal of funding the production of the album. After around\nfour months of campaigning, I raised $4,000 from community donations to take\nto the studio to record the album.\n\nLots of communities have started donation drives of this kind, and many have\nbeen successful. Unfortunately, many others have been unsuccessful. Here are\nsome tips that might help you improve your chances of success:\n\nMake donating easy\n\n    \n\nBe sure to make donating a piece of cake. Most people will want to donate\nonline with a credit or debit card or with PayPal. For Severed Fifth we used\nPayPal to gather the donations, but you can also use a service such as\n[KickStarter](http://www.kickstarter.com), which rallies prospective donors\naround a target figure. Regardless of the service you choose, make sure that\ndonating is a breeze and only takes a few minutes.\n\nPick a goal\n\n    \n\nA donation drive should have a target and focus and not just be a case of\n“give us money, please!” Whether it is a target outcome (e.g., the recording\nin the previous Severed Fifth example), a target amount, or anything else, be\nsure to have a goal that people feel passionate about supporting with their\nwallet.\n\nMessage extensively\n\n    \n\nDonation drives need a lot of messaging. Be sure to keep banging the drum\nabout how people can help your effort and why their contributions are\nimportant, and regularly updating people on the progress of the donation drive\nand how close you are to the goal.\n\nProvide incentives\n\n    \n\nAnother useful approach is to provide incentives for different types of\ndonations. As an example, with Severed Fifth we provided different rewards for\ndifferent amounts (e.g., $50 gets you a t-shirt, $60 gets you a t-shirt and\nCD, etc.). This had great results.\n\nIf you can create a campaign around something that people are passionate about\nand keep the messaging going, it is incredible what is possible when people\nare willing to support a shared goal.\n\n### Sponsorship\n\nSponsorship is another useful area for funding. This will be more complex for\nsmaller, newer communities, and much of the sponsorship game is about knowing\nthe right people who can present your case for sponsorship to the respective\ncompanies.\n\nWhile sponsorship is often considered within the context of providing checks\nfor a chunk of money, you should also investigate sponsorship for the\nprovision of goods and services. As an example, a company called [Bytemark\nHosting](http://www.bytemark.co.uk) provides sponsorship to run the Severed\nFifth website and hosting. In many cases these requests for sponsorship are\neasier for the company than cutting a check.\n\nWhen applying to different companies for sponsorship you should produce a\nsponsorship pack that outlines some key pieces of information:\n\nAbout you\n\n    \n\nDescribe the community, your goals, and the progress you have made, and word\nthis in a way that is sympathetic to the company’s goals.\n\nWhat you require\n\n    \n\nOutline the specifics of what you are asking the company to provide. Is it\nmoney? If so, how much? Is it equipment? If so, what equipment and how many\nunits? When making these requirements, base them on what you are likely to get\n(e.g., don’t ask a small start-up for a huge amount of money it probably\ndoesn’t have).\n\nWhat they will get\n\n    \n\nExplain what they will get in return for their sponsorship. In most cases the\ncompany wants branding on your website and on promotional materials. Describe\nwhat sponsoring companies will get in return (e.g., their logo on your\nwebsite, mentions in your social media feed and newsletter, their logo on your\nevent t-shirts, etc.).\n\n# Wrapping Up\n\nIn this chapter, we have made some great progress in our journey. We have laid\nthe foundation for an organized, well-planned strategy that will unite your\ncommunity behind the same set of objectives and goals. With this foundation in\nplace, we can expand and refine it as we progress through the book and explore\nthe many other concepts farther down the road. If you have followed through\nwith each exercise in this chapter, it will have helped you to think\nstructurally about your community and its goals, and share the fruits of this\nstructured thinking with everyone involved. By definition, this will help your\ncommunity rock and roll that little bit harder.\n\nWhen we started our journey into community, we talked about the social economy\nas a collection of processes to achieve social capital. These processes are\nessential in a simple, effective, and nonbureaucratic community. They affect\nhow people join your community, how they collaborate, how ideas are\ncommunicated, how problems are communicated, and more. These processes can be\nthe difference between success and failure.\n\nThe first set of processes that we need to consider is how we communicate\neffectively in our community. With this in mind, let’s dive into the next\nchapter. All set? Let’s go....\n\n\n# Chapter 3. Communicating Clearly\n\n“Before I speak, I have something important to say.”\n\n—Groucho Marx\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, my friend somehow obtained an LP he had “borrowed\nwithout asking” from his brother. He handed me the large disc adorned with\ncardboard sleeve, all carefully buried in a white plastic bag. As I retrieved\nsaid sleeve from said bag, my eyes widened and I skipped a breath: it was the\nfirst time I witnessed the sheer brilliance of an Iron Maiden record.\n\nI listened to that LP until it damaged the pin in my record player. I loved\nthe energy, I loved the look (including the spandex…I am not kidding), and I\njust wanted to be them. Unfortunately, I had neither talent nor spandex, but\nmerely a bowl haircut and large white socks.\n\nInspired, I decided I was going to learn to play the guitar. My parents bought\nme an old acoustic guitar and I parked myself on my bed night after night\ntrying to sound like my rock and roll heroes. Of course, I instead sounded\nlike an incompetent 11-year-old with an acoustic guitar. I sucked, but I stuck\nat it.\n\nAs the years rumbled on, so did my guitar playing. Fortunately, my skills were\nimproving and I was reading more and more about music, guitarists, and the\nbands I loved. While flipping through a copy of _Guitarist_ magazine, I came\nacross a quote that I seem to remember was from Eric Clapton, but I’m not\nquite sure. Whoever it was, his words really resonated with me (pun intended):\n\n> It’s not the notes you play, it’s the notes you don’t play.\n\nWhile I am still making oodles of music today, this quote didn’t really take\nhold of me until five years later when I started writing. What the little\nnugget of wisdom implies is that, although we may obsess over the obvious\ncomponents in an art form (such as the notes in music), it is often the hidden\nand underlying messages that offer the most value (such as not playing certain\nnotes).\n\nThis is a strong and relevant message for building communities. Community is\nabsolutely about understanding the ether. Our notes are the processes,\ngovernance, tools, and methods in which we work together. The notes we don’t\nplay are the subtle nuances in how we pull these notes together and share them\nwith one another. The space between the notes is _communication_.\n\n# He Said, She Said\n\nCommunication is essential in community. It is the metaphorical highway that\nconnects the many towns and people in your world. Effective communication\nbrings together your community members in a manner that is free-flowing,\nproductive, and accessible.\n\nYou may spend hours putting together elegant and sleek processes,\ninfrastructure, and governance, but if members of your community can’t\ncommunicate well with one another, you may as well pack up your bags and go\nand pursue a career in cabaret on _The Love Boat_.\n\nOur analogy with highways and towns maps eerily well to how we wire up our\ncommunity with the communication channels it needs. To ensure that our towns\ncan work together, we have two primary tasks on our hands:\n\nCreate the highways\n\n    \n\nFirst, your community needs to build a set of resources to facilitate\ncommunication, discussion, and the sharing of ideas and best practices. In\nmany cases these resources are online facilities, such as mailing lists,\nforums, and discussion channels.\n\nEncourage great driving\n\n    \n\nOnce your communication channels are in place, they can be used in all manner\nof ways. There will, of course, be some good drivers and some bad drivers;\nsome will communicate exceptionally well, and some will irritate and agitate\nanyone who crosses their path. You want to inspire and encourage a baseline\nquality of communication. This is not about excluding people who are imperfect\nwriters or speakers, but rather about providing a consistent example of simple\napproaches to communication that make the community easier to understand and\nmore pleasurable for everyone involved.\n\nIn this chapter we are going to cast our sights on both of these topics,\ndiscuss a range of mediums for building the free flow of communication, make\ngood use of those facilities, incorporate transparency, and avoid the common\nproblem of a community preferring to speak rather than do.\n\nSo, let’s get started by laying down the highways and putting some cars on the\nroad. Now is the time to build our community’s communication backbone....\n\n# Building Your Communication Channels\n\nEarlier we created our TODO list of key aims and ambitions for building a\nstrong community. We are now going to dig up that list and cast our sights on\none very specific item.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively.\n\nGood communication serves many purposes in a community. It is the foundation\nof how your members work together, share goals and ambitions, and build social\nrelationships with one another. It is communication that ensures that everyone\nis on the same page, heading in the same direction, marching to the same beat.\n\nGood communication is also a powerful security blanket. When communication\nbreaks down in community, it can cause havoc. Volunteer communities are driven\nby members with a set of values that reflect themselves and the values of the\nwider community. These values are important to regularly reinforce in your\ncommunity: they are the metabolism that fights off the threats and problems\nthat can undermine the goals of the community. When your members feel like\nthey are disconnected from the community, they lose their sense of value.\n\nCommunication can be divided into three primary areas:\n\nIncoming\n\n    \n\nReceiving and processing feedback and viewpoints for the purpose of\nimprovement. An example of this could include surveys to determine how well a\npart of your community is working.\n\nOutgoing\n\n    \n\nSharing news, stories, and achievements from the community with the rest of\nthe world. An example of this could be showing off something your community\nhas created.\n\nInternal\n\n    \n\nInternal discussions and meetings in the community to discuss objectives,\ngoals, conflict, and other issues. An example of this could include meetings\nthat are designed to decide how your community will work together toward its\ngoals.\n\nEach of these forms of communication is essential for a strong community. All\ncommunities need open and objective feedback. They should all share their\nachievements and what they have produced. Finally, all communities need to\nhave regular internal discussions and meetings to ensure that everyone is\ninteracting smoothly. Great communication should be a goal for the many\ndifferent parts of your community, as opposed to one specific area. When we\nget great communication right, community feels vibrant, thriving, and\naccessible.\n\nWe are going to cover all three of these topics in this book. We will discuss\nincoming communication in [Chapter 8](ch08.html \"Chapter 8. Measuring\nCommunity\"), outgoing communication in [Chapter 7](ch07.html\n\"Chapter 7. Building Buzz\"), and internal communication here.\n\n## Striving for Clarity\n\nAs communication is critical to the success of your community, it is stunning\nhow many communities just get it plain wrong. Many are plagued with long-\nwinded, overly complex, and difficult-to-use communication channels, and it\nseems you need a degree in rocket science to understand how to join these\nchannels. Then, it seems you need to go back to school to get a degree in\ncomputational linguistics to fit into the culture and expectations of these\ncommunication channels. Many have an unwritten rule book stapled to the side\nof the channel, and if you are unfamiliar with its scriptures, the response\ncan be terse, forthright, and sometimes outright rude. This is the last thing\nyou want. Instead, you want to create simple, efficient, welcoming, and\nenjoyable methods of keeping in touch with other members of the project.\n\nThe greatest form of communication is always going to be sitting in a room\nwith a real person, face to face. In this setting you can speak freely, your\nwords flowing as quickly as your brain conjures them up, with body language,\ngestures, and facial expressions further augmenting the flow of conversation.\nAny technological form of communication is going to compromise some of these\nattributes. Of course, many who are socially uncomfortable in face-to-face\nsituations will hail the muting of these additional attributes in conversation\nas a victory for accessibility and openness.\n\nWhen laying down the lines of communication for our community, our goal is to\nstrive for _clarity_. Imagine, if you will, a world in which every\ncommunication is clear, accessible, and well understood by your community. You\nneed to think carefully about the culture in which your community communicates\nand strive to build a highway and driving style that achieves that culture.\nYou first need to lay the foundation, which can be found in clarity and\ntransparency. Your members want to be able to hear, read, or experience each\ncommunication and understand it straightaway. When clarity is in place,\ncontributions will begin to flow shortly afterward. When confusion,\nmisunderstanding, and opacity set in, your members will either spend their\ndays seeking clarification or move on, confused and frustrated.\n\nClarity and transparency are also important in attracting new members. For\nexample, most online communities’ communication channels are indexed by search\nengines. How many times have you typed something into Google and some of the\nresults that appear are mailing lists, forums, or other online discussions\nthat are happening inside a community? Potential new community members will\nread these discussions and it will affect their desire and willingness to join\nyour community. If the communications are complex, socially fraught, or\notherwise suboptimal, potential members may prefer to spend their valuable\nspare time playing Guitar Hero rather than joining you and your band of merry\nmen and women.\n\nAchieving clarity requires attention to two areas. First, a sensible choice of\ncommunication medium is required (mailing list, IRC, forum, etc.). This is\nrelatively straightforward and actually fairly uninteresting. We will make\nsome decisions about this over the following pages. The second, more complex\npart is picking communication channels that match the needs of the users while\nmaximizing clarity. Let’s spend some time talking about that.\n\n## Choices, Choices\n\nYour community has oodles of communication channels to choose from, each with\nqualities that make sense in different scenarios and to different people. The\ngoal is to match the right medium to your community and to understand the pros\nand cons of that medium to help the pros bubble to the surface and keep the\ncons well away from the kitchen.\n\nPicking an appropriate medium is largely about understanding your contributors\nand their workflow. Each type of contributor will have different preferences.\nSoftware developers generally prefer content to be delivered directly to them.\nThey are typically most comfortable with mailing lists and RSS feeds (updated\ncontent from websites and online resources) and don’t like to have to refresh\na browser to see if new content exists. This is part of why many (typically\nWestern) developers don’t get on very well with forums. Some communities have\nbridged this divide by providing gateways so that a mailing list post goes to\na forum and vice versa (an example of this is the Banshee project at\n<http://banshee-project.org/support/>).\n\n### Note\n\nOf course, many developers do love forums. The last statement was based on\ngeneral experience with developers over a range of projects and development\ncultures, largely in Western countries. If you know developers who love\nforums, don’t be alarmed: we are all friends here.\n\nUsers are (typically) different. Users often love forums for their\naccessibility and simplicity. The conversation flow is clear, the interface is\nfriendly, and the web browser is a familiar window to that world. Users are\nused to having to refresh their browser to see if updates exist. They are used\nto visiting many websites to find content, and they generally feel\nuncomfortable about technical barriers to these discussions and content. Users\njust don’t like to jump through hoops, particularly technical hoops that can\neasily trip them up.\n\nBelieve it or not, these roles are fairly set in stone. Trying to persuade a\ndeveloper to use a forum can be like persuading a cat to chase after a stick.\nA developer may agree to give it a shot, but I can almost guarantee you that\nit won’t work out. Communication channels are highways of habit: people have\ntheir preferences and they generally stick to them.\n\nAt the beginning of a community you need to know which roles and personalities\nare most comfortable with which communication mediums; this is the very first\nstep in building great communication. You can then make informed choices. We\nwill explore some of these common mediums and some notes that can help inform\nthese choices in just a moment.\n\n### Communication fetishism\n\nAnother key consideration when building effective communication channels is\nkeeping discussion focused. This is a two-part process in avoiding\n_communication fetishism_ and also _keeping all your eyeballs in one place_.\n\nCommunication fetishism is particularly prevalent in online and technical\ncommunities and points to the problem of new communities wanting to provide\nevery possible communication channel under the sun. They set up mailing lists,\nforums, IRC channels, Second Life worlds, and more. This is the _wrong_ thing\nto do. You should instead identify the key roles and personalities in your\nproject and choose mediums that make the most sense to those roles. Let’s look\nat an example.\n\nWhen I set up the Jokosher project, I knew that the primary roles in the\ncommunity were going to be users and developers. I wanted to ensure that the\nproject had communication channels for technical discussion about the\ndevelopment of the application, but also a place for musicians to discuss\nJokosher, share tips, and show off their compositions. I decided to set up a\nmailing list for the developers and a forum for the users. These mediums\nreflected the respective developer and user roles well. The only other medium\nI set up was a #jokosher IRC channel for real-time discussion and meetings for\nthe developers. Although the channel exists, we never point regular users to\nthat channel; the forum is far more appropriate.\n\nThe second part of the process is “keeping all your eyeballs in one place.”\nOne of the mistakes a lot of new communities make is to fragment individual\ncommunication mediums too heavily. Let’s look at another example.\n\nWhen we started LugRadio, I wanted us to provide a place for listeners to talk\nabout the show and the topics in each episode. Forums were the best choice, so\nI set them up.\n\nIn most discussion forums you can have a number of subforums. As an example,\nif you had a software project, you could have subforums for General\nDiscussion, Development, Documentation, and so on. When I set up the LugRadio\nforums I created three subforums: General Discussion, Ideas for the Show, and\nMirrors. Each subforum had a clear purpose for discussion.\n\nIn contrast to many other forums, we had a tiny number of subforums. Many new\nforums have 10 or more subforums, and we had 3. This was deliberate. When you\nset up a new community, you want to generate discussion quickly. You want to\ninitiate the discussion but encourage and inspire others to participate and\nget involved. If you have a forum with too many subforums, you will fragment\nthe discussion: you will get many tiny bits of discussion across the\nsubforums, and little consistency. Keep the discussion in just a few places,\nand conversation will flow.\n\nThis happens because people waste time choosing the right forum instead of\njust posting. What is worse, some get confused and just don’t post at all.\nDiscussion gets going faster when you have fewer choices.\n\n## The Mediums\n\nWith some general best practices under our belts, let’s now roll up our\nsleeves and take a look at the nitty-gritty of the range of mediums available\nto us. Over the following few pages I am going to provide a quick-shot summary\nof these mediums and many of their behavioral elements.\n\nBefore we begin, we need to discuss a key consideration in choosing an\neffective medium: how easy it is to record and retrieve conversations that\nhave occurred in the past. When communicating with others online, each medium\nplaces different opportunities in the hands of others to find these\nconversations. This attribute can dramatically adjust how people behave and\nconverse in a given medium.\n\nAs an example, it is well known in many communities that mailing lists have\ntheir conversations archived and publicly available on a website. This website\nis then archived and retrievable by search engines, such as Google. With this\nin mind, participants in mailing lists often act in a more formalized and\n“professional” capacity: you never know when that conversation on a mailing\nlist will show up when a prospective employer is Googling you for a job\ninterview.\n\nOn the flip side, there is the real-time IRC chat medium. While many IRC\nchannels can and are logged, it is far harder to find the logs and find\nrelevant discussion in the reams of chatter that happen each day on an IRC\nchannel. As such, the medium feels less recorded, and many of the participants\nfeel more comfortable in communicating more socially.\n\nYou should consider these implications when building out your communication\nfacilities, and ensure that your participants are fully aware of where they\nstand. No one wants a situation where someone says something, assuming it is\nnot archived, and then finds (to his chagrin) that it appears in a Google\nsearch.\n\n### Mailing lists\n\nMailing lists are an excellent medium for discussion. They are low-bandwidth,\na familiar interface (email), and fairly accessible, and conversation is\ndelivered directly to your email client. The delivery of the conversation\nreduces the chance of new contributors forgetting about your community: each\ntime they check their email, they are reminded that your community exists, and\nthey may actually read the messages and respond.\n\nMailing lists are typically preferred by software developers, and of common\ninterest in the open source world. Many nonprogramming contributors often use\nand enjoy mailing lists.\n\nMailing lists are not all sweetness and light, though. Joining a mailing list\nis a little complex. It requires people to know how to join, sign up with an\nemail address, respond to the mail, and know where to send messages. Also,\nunforgiving spam filters can make the whole process icky.\n\nMailing lists also assume that you are interested in all discussions, and when\nyou join, all discussions come to you. This makes mailing lists implicitly of\nmost interest to those who plan a serious contribution or interest in a\ncommunity.\n\nAnother issue to bear in mind with mailing lists is their lack of immediacy.\nAs an example, if you are a community software developer working at 10 p.m. on\na Saturday and you have a problem, you could post a question to the mailing\nlist, but you may not get an answer until Monday or Tuesday and are thus\nstymied. If more immediate results are needed, real-time communication\nchannels such as IRC are better (of course, assuming people are on the\nchannel: silence sucks on all mediums).\n\nNormal end-user and consumer reaction to mailing lists is mixed. Many users\nhave single-shot queries and questions, and the requirement to battle through\nthe somewhat complex sign-up process and then receive all conversations can be\noff-putting.\n\n### Note\n\nAn important consideration to make when setting up a mailing list is whether\nthe list is archived on the Internet. If you want the conversations to be\nprivate (such as if the mailing list is for a governance body), you should\nclose off the archives. We discuss governance in detail in [Chapter\n10](ch10.html \"Chapter 10. Governance\").\n\n### Discussion forums\n\nForums are a very popular, low-barrier-to-entry medium. They manifest in the\nform of websites that allow you to create an identity and have a discussion\nusing that identity.\n\nForums have exploded in popularity in recent years, and some huge forums have\ndeveloped across the Internet. At the time of this writing, the biggest in the\nworld is an anime role-playing community with over 15 million members and over\n1 billion posts. Now that is a lot of tentacles and oversized eyes. Even the\nfar smaller LugRadio forum has over 1,000 members and 40,000+ posts. A common\nuse for forums has been as a support channel for your community. Many software\nprojects (including Jokosher) have found this useful.\n\nForums are a popular choice among less-technical users. They are easy to join\nand easy to use, and many forums allow users to inject personality into their\nprofiles with avatar pictures, personal details, and signatures. Many forums\nalso encourage discussion via the use of ranks—special community descriptions\nbased around the number of posts that a member makes. Many forum users cherish\nthese rankings and take great pride in making many posts to achieve them.\n\n### Note\n\nBe careful with these ranks as a means of measuring community; they are often\nnot all that insightful. We will discuss this in [Chapter 8](ch08.html\n\"Chapter 8. Measuring Community\").\n\nDue to the user-focused nature of forums, discussion is often from the\nperspective of new users, and often those who are less familiar with\nnetiquette. As such, you may attract some immature behavior and spam on\nforums. With this in mind, you should ensure that you have a number of\nmoderators who can tend to this kind of behavior. The best approach to\nmoderation is to anoint a handful of well-respected and trustworthy\ncontributors who use your forum.\n\n### Note\n\nMany social media sites, such as LinkedIn and Facebook, provide forum-like\nfunctionality built into their sites. These can be useful for some\ncommunities.\n\n### Social media\n\nSocial media is a large and comprehensive medium for many different types of\ncommunication, so much so that all of [Chapter 6](ch06.html \"Chapter 6. Social\nMedia\") in the book is devoted to it.\n\n### IRC\n\nIRC is a real-time chat medium that has become increasingly popular for\ncommunities. There are IRC providers all over the world, and many IRC networks\ncater to specific purposes. As an example, the Freenode network\n(_irc.freenode.net_) is specifically aimed at providing IRC channels and\nconversation for open source projects. Although an entirely open and\naccessible medium, IRC is still very much populated by technology-related\nchannels.\n\nThe value of IRC is in real-time discussion, and there are many benefits:\n\nBonding\n\n    \n\nCommunities bond effectively in real time. It provides a chance for people to\nhave general day-to-day conversations that would be out of place on a more\nformalized medium such as a mailing list. Many people use IRC for socializing\nand often spend time chitchatting: this all helps for bonding.\n\nSpeed\n\n    \n\nDiscussions can often occur faster on IRC. It provides an excellent medium for\ndiscussing and debating, and it is smoother and easier to debate on IRC than\non a mailing list or forum.\n\nMeetings\n\n    \n\nIRC offers an excellent opportunity for real-time meetings. We will discuss\nthis later in this chapter and in [Chapter 12](ch12.html \"Chapter 12. Creating\nand Running Events\").\n\nLogs\n\n    \n\nIRC channels can be logged, which provides an excellent means of documenting\ndiscussions and meetings.\n\nIf you are setting up a community that is focused on technology or the\nInternet, an IRC channel could be a useful addition. It is important that your\nIRC channel is open, accessible, and well publicized. You should ensure that\nit is listed on your community’s website.\n\n### Note\n\nMany IRC services are blocked from commercial work environments, and some of\nyour members may therefore not be able to take a sneaky IRC break while at\nwork.\n\nThere are some web-based IRC clients that may solve this problem for those\nusers, and you may want to list some of these alternatives on your community’s\nwebsite.\n\nAs with any medium, IRC attracts its own kind of personalities, but the IRC\npersonality profile is fairly mixed. On the one hand, we see many developers\nmaking use of IRC every day to keep in touch with their communities. On the\nother hand, we also see many new users joining IRC. You should ensure that\nyour IRC channel(s) cater to these different types of users. If you are\nrunning a development project, it is best to have separate channels for\ndevelopers and users (such as _#myproject-dev_ and _#myproject-users_ ,\nrespectively).\n\nAn interesting personality trait in IRC that you should be aware of is the\ndesire for power. Many communities have discovered that a lot of importance is\nplaced on IRC channel moderation and control. IRC allows people to become\nchannel operators, and these privileges allow people to be kicked out and\nbanned from channels. Many communities have experienced power struggles,\narguments, and bickering over these privileges: being an operator is a badge\nof honor for many people. You should give out channel privileges sparingly, to\nthose who will treat those privileges with care.\n\nNot Showing Power\n\nIn all IRC channels, some people can be operators and have the power to kick\nout or ban people from the channel. By default, an icon appears next to the\noperators in your channel. Many channels decide not to have the operators\ndisplay their privileges in general.\n\nOn the one hand, this makes sense: if there are no visible operators, the\nchannel feels very equal. On the other hand, having visible ops can be self-\npolicing because it can ensure that people behave properly. My recommendation:\nif someone is an operator, ask her not to display the icon, but if someone\nneeds to be kicked out of the channel, have the operator switch on her\nprivileges and firmly plant that boot in the offending user.\n\n# Leading by Example\n\nHowever you decide to lay down the lines of communication and whichever tools\nand mediums you decide to use, you should strive for communication in your\ncommunity to be friendly, clear, and productive. You want your community’s\nmembers to not only feel engaged, excited, and enabled, but also to enjoy\ntheir interactions with the rest of the community.\n\nThis may not be quite as easy as it sounds, however. Communities are, by\ndefinition, groups of people, and those people have different personalities,\nhabits, opinions, and approaches. These nuances can sometimes complicate how\nwe communicate.\n\nPeople can and do get frustrated with one another, have mismatched\nexpectations, engage in unclear and tense discussions, and indulge in other\nagitating agendas. Not only that, but people sometimes just get out of bed on\nthe wrong side. Everyone has bad days. Confusion happens. Life will get in the\nway, and people get busy.\n\nMany of these causes are entirely innocent and simply the nature of being\nhuman. With people being the catalyst of community, you could be forgiven for\nthinking that there is nothing we can do about these problems in\ncommunication.\n\nNot so.\n\nCommunities are vessels of culture: every community has its own norms, and\nthese norms are defined by community leaders—community leaders such as _you_.\nYou can avoid many of these potential issues in communication by not only\nsetting a strong example, but also inspiring the wider community to follow a\npositive example in how they communicate with one another.\n\nYou are Always Learning\n\nSome time ago I was at an Ubuntu Developer Summit and busily running from\nsession to session, coordinating discussions, planning work for the release,\nand handling other related tasks. One afternoon, Amber, a friend of mine and a\ncommunity member (and proofreader of _The Art of Community_), asked if she\ncould have a quiet word with me.\n\nOf course, this was never going to be a good word, and probably not all that\nquiet, either. I braced myself for impact.\n\nAmber then shared that she had noticed that I had been a little too\ndirectional and focused in some of the sessions. She felt I was pushing too\nfast for outcomes and conclusions, and racing through debates to find\nsolutions in a sometimes fairly abrupt way. I thanked her for the feedback\n(which was surprising to me, as I felt I had been pretty balanced in my\ncommunication), and we discussed what might be the cause. Was I stressed? Was\nI being impatient? Amber was keen to stress that I was not rude, just a little\ntoo focused at times. As we discussed this we then hit on the cause.\n\nCanonical, like many start-ups, is a very intense and focused environment.\nThere are lots of meetings, and no one wants to sit around wasting time;\neveryone is focused on solutions and getting there as quickly as possible. I\nrealized when Amber shared her feedback that I had been communicating with our\ncommunity members at the event in the same way I would communicate with\ncolleagues. Importantly, the pace of many volunteer community members is\ndifferent from the pace of Canonical staff members who have work items,\ndeliverables, metrics, and other pressing matters to deal with.\n\nIt was a salient and memorable experience, and it taught me not only how I\nshould moderate my approach to communication with different environments, but\nalso that we are always learning each day about how to be great communicators\nand feedback is the key to learning and refining how we do it.\n\nTo lead by example, we can break down the problem into the following two bite-\nsized chunks:\n\nDaily communication\n\n    \n\nThe day-to-day discussions, ideas, and debates that are expressed across your\nrange of mediums\n\nLonger writing\n\n    \n\nLonger, more thoughtful, written forms of communication that are often used to\ninspire, advise, and direct your community\n\nLet’s now take a spin through both of these areas and explore some best\npractices, tips, and tricks for communicating well.\n\n## Daily Communication\n\nLeading by example means communicating in a way that you feel is\nrepresentative and appropriate for you and your community. It is about\ninspiring your community to get behind an ethic of good communication and\nensuring that your community is exposed to that ethic on a daily basis. Life\nhas taught us that consistent exposure to high-quality content can engender a\nhigh-quality response among onlookers. Great music often inspires great\nmusicians; great art inspires great artists; and great community inspires\ngreat community members.\n\nTo lead by example, you need to be the living incarnation of the advice you\noffer to your community. As community leaders, we often settle ourselves\nhappily into the role of _Chief Advisor of Doing Things the Right Way_ , and\nit is hugely important that we practice what we preach and get intimately\nfamiliar with the taste of our own dog food.\n\nBeing a great daily communicator is not about being an incredible writer,\nbeing a proficient speaker, or using words reserved for a Scrabble-winning\nsmackdown. Great communication instead focuses on clarity, detail, objective\nthought, and a consistently high quality of interaction.\n\nTeaching great communication is complex, and many books have been written on\nthe subject. Fortunately, becoming a great communicator doesn’t require an\nexercise in academically satisfying hand waving or an attempt to sound like a\nmonocle-wearing intellectual, but to simply be clear, friendly, and\nstraightforward in your communications.\n\nTo achieve this, there are two stages involved. First, you should familiarize\nyourself with some simple recommended rules of engagement. These are:\n\nBe clear\n\n    \n\nAlways try to communicate as clearly and transparently as possible. Speak\nfrankly and use language familiar to your recipient. Try not to blind people\nwith science, but don’t patronize them either. Always try to craft your\ncommunications to your audience.\n\nBe concise\n\n    \n\nKeep to the point, and don’t weigh your communications down with babble. Don’t\nuse 1,000 words to say what could be said in 100\\. With many of us receiving\nso many emails, messages, phone calls, and other distractions every day, don’t\nburden your community with unnecessary rambling. If an email takes longer than\nfive minutes to type, you may be doing something wrong (or you are a really,\nreally slow typist).\n\nBe responsive\n\n    \n\nYou don’t have to be wedded to your computer, but try to get back to people\nwithin a few days of them getting in touch with you. If you are drowning in\nemails and work, just let people know you might be a little delayed, so their\nexpectations are set correctly. This issue is applicable not just to personal\ncommunication directed to you and other community leaders, but also to mailing\nlists, forums, IRC, and other public channels. Put yourself in the sender’s\nposition: it is impossible to tell the difference between “nobody is answering\nmy question because nobody knows the answer, meaning that what I’m trying to\ndo is impossible and I should try something else” and “nobody is answering my\nquestion even though everyone knows the answer, because everybody is too busy,\nmeaning that I should sit and wait longer rather than abandoning this\napproach.” It helps to make your community seem friendlier to new members and\noutsiders if they can tell the difference between these two things.\n\nBe fun\n\n    \n\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make when they become well respected\nin a community is to hide their personality in the interests of “looking\nprofessional.” Let your personality shine through. Make jokes and witty\ncomments, and be sarcastic. Communities are supposed to be fun, and this is an\nimportant part of leading by example.\n\nBe human\n\n    \n\nWe are all human, and we all make mistakes. If you screw up, say so and\napologize. People will cherish your honesty and your integrity to hold your\nhands up when you get it wrong. This is a critically important part of leading\nby example: you want your community to also accept when they get it wrong.\nWhat we want to avoid is defensiveness, because it causes people to enter into\na game of rebounding defensive statements, which is frustrating and damaging.\nIf your hands are tied in being frank and open about your mistakes (such as if\nyour employer would be less than thrilled), identify what went wrong and try\nto secure confidence in your community that it won’t happen again in the\nfuture.\n\nThe second step is to learn from others. Observe email, chat conversations,\nphone discussions, and other interactions, and deconstruct them in your mind\nto find nuggets of wisdom and inspiration. You are sure to find some people\nwho are always clear, concise, and detailed in their communications, and these\nare excellent role models for you.\n\n### Netiquette\n\nIn many online communities there are often localized technical cultural norms\nthat are in play. These are small conventions and methods of communicating\nthat are typically localized to a community, be it online or physical. Respect\nfor these conventions and (often unwritten) rules is known as _netiquette_.\n\nAlthough most of you will be familiar with some of the common conventions of\ncommunicating well on the Internet, you should be familiar with some of the\nlocal conventions in your specific community.\n\nAs an example, many communities use mailing lists as a primary method of\ncommunication. In many technical communities, some members can get rather\nagitated when new members unwittingly use an approach called _top posting_.\nLet’s illustrate this with an example. Imagine you are subscribed to a public\nmailing list. You get the following simple email:\n\nHey All,  \nI just wanted to ask what is the answer to Foo?  \nThanks!  \nBob  \n\nTop posting is when you reply above the quotes message. As an example:\n\nHi Bob,  \nThe answer is Bar.  \nJono  \n> Hey All,  \n> I just wanted to ask what is the answer to Foo?  \n> Thanks!  \n> Bob  \n\nThis is often frowned upon. The reason is that in online discussion threads\nwith a series of messages replying to pieces of previous messages, top posting\nmakes this thread of discussion difficult to follow. Here is an example of\nwhen someone replies to a top-posted message, but below the message:\n\n> Hi Bob,  \n> The answer is Bar.  \n> Jono  \n>> Hey All,  \n>> I just wanted to ask what is the answer to Foo?  \n>> Thanks!  \n>> Bob  \nOK, thanks for the reply, Jono!  \nBob  \n\nThe conversation is already a pain in the nether regions to follow. If\neveryone responds below the quoted text, the conversation would instead look\nlike the following at this point (particularly when cutting out the bits of\nunneeded conversation):\n\n>> Hey All,  \n>> I just wanted to ask what is the answer to Foo?  \n> The answer is Bar  \nOK, thanks for the reply, Jono!  \nBob  \n\nThough this might seem like a minor detail, many online communities get\nsurprisingly frustrated at these kinds of mistakes. Unfortunately, communities\noften fail to document these expectations around discussion, and many innocent\nbystanders get short shrift when they accidentally get it wrong.\n\nYou should always try to document these expectations around communication on\nyour community’s website. If you are new to a community, it is recommended\nthat you first observe the communication for a few days before you\nparticipate. This will help you to get a firm idea of these social\nconventions.\n\n### Avoiding bikeshedding\n\nAlmost every technical community I have seen makes the same two common\nmistakes: obsessing over resources and discussing topics to death. The latter\nof these two problems is rather excitingly called _bikeshedding_.[1]\n\nIn many collaborative communities, one of the first communication resources to\nbe set up is a mailing list or forum. As with any new community, excitement is\nhigh, and the thrill of communicating with your new community members from all\nover the world gets everyone pumped up and fills these communication channels\nwith discussion.\n\nWith the communication lines open and an unbridled sense of excitement around\nthe shared goal of the community, plans get made posthaste. Ideas, thoughts,\ncommitments, and other agreements get discussed. The community gets its first\nopportunity to dream together, and it feels like the world is your oyster. The\nresult of this exciting brainstorming period is a stack of incredibly exciting\nplans and ideas. All that needs to happen now is to turn those dreams into\nreality, right?\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not quite that simple.\n\nTalking is always easier than doing. It is far easier to discuss a great idea\n(often in exhaustive detail) than to implement a great idea. Reams and reams\nof discussion from many interested parties can explode on your mailing list,\nbut this in itself can be a blocker to producing the very projects you\ndiscuss. While up-front specifications can help communities build something,\noverspecification and information overflow can have the inverse effect.\n\nPart of the problem is that many communities focus a little too much on having\nevery “i” dotted and every “t” crossed before work begins. The issue here is\ntwofold. First, too much discussion will typically result in a hugely complex\nplan that is difficult to keep track of if not well documented. This can be\noff-putting for volunteers who just want to get started with something fun and\nmanageable. When you overdiscuss and overengineer an idea, the complexity can\nbe daunting.\n\nThe second problem, particularly in the early stages of your community, is\nthat your new members need to see results or they will grow bored and leave. A\ngreat community is often built by a small set of capable and fast-moving\ncontributors right at the beginning of its evolution. If a community spends\nthree months discussing an idea yet produces little or nothing, many potential\ncontributors will grow impatient with the discussion and develop a sense that\nthe community is nothing more than a talking shop. This is exactly what we\nwant to avoid.\n\nThere are two approaches that can help prevent this problem from occurring.\nFirst, you should not discuss topics in too much detail without connecting\nthem to specific plans. Ask who is going to work on what, when the work is\nlikely to be completed, and how you can help. As an example, if you are\nworking on a software project, you should aim to have some code written within\na week of the project starting. Always keep your eyes on the prize: reaching\nthe goals of the community, be it software, an event, a campaign, or whatever\nelse.\n\nAnother solution is to build a culture of experiments in which your members\nchannel their energy into a specific project that can be proposed to your\ncommunity at a later date. This has been a popular approach in the open source\nGNOME desktop community. Many developers have worked on their own pet projects\nthat involve a handful of developers. These projects are created, enhanced,\nand refined, and when they are mature enough, they are proposed for inclusion\nin the main GNOME desktop. This is an excellent, productive, and engaging\napproach to creating things together.\n\nBuilding a “Can Do” Culture\n\nIt is also important to set your own expectations correctly when it comes to\nyour new community members.\n\nThe vast majority of people who join your community will be passive and\ncontribute little more than opinion and commentary. This is perfectly normal.\nYou should go into your community and expect bikeshedding to be a very real\nthreat. You should expect that most of your new community members will\ncontribute little in the way of practical results.\n\nYou instead need to build a culture around doing things. You need to inspire\nyour contributors to make things happen. You should speak positively about\nyour goals and encourage everyone to contribute to their implementation, no\nmatter how small the contribution.\n\n## Longer Writing\n\nIn addition to day-to-day discussion, email conversations, online chats, and\nother elements, great communication often calls for longer, more considered\npieces and articles. These longer chunks of writing are often required in a\nnumber of different places, including:\n\nBlogs\n\n    \n\nWith the continued growth of blogs as not only a personal publishing medium\nbut also a community publishing medium, you may need to write articles,\nstories, and features about your community.\n\nEmails\n\n    \n\nMany community leaders send out longer, more considered, and more strategic\nemails that help to guide the community in its direction.\n\nMagazine articles/web articles\n\n    \n\nYour community may get the opportunity to be featured in a magazine or\nwebsite, and you will need to be able to present your thoughts well.\n\nDocuments\n\n    \n\nYour community will produce documents, guides, specifications, help, and more,\nand these should be clearly written and easy to read.\n\nWriting well happens at both a mechanical and a stylistic level: you first\nneed to produce properly written language and then build on this with words,\nexpressions, phrases, and approaches that are interesting to read. Let’s\nexplore some of these topics now.\n\n### The mechanics of writing\n\nThe first step in being a good writer is to learn the mechanics of great\nwriting. At this level we are absolutely focused on the nuts and bolts of\nwriting: spelling, grammar, and punctuation.\n\nFor some people this is the be-all and end-all of communication: producing\n“perfect writing” that follows strong editorial guidelines. Using our previous\n“It’s not the notes you play, it’s the notes you don’t play” quote with which\nI opened this chapter, the mechanics of writing are our metaphorical notes.\nThough it is absolutely not the be-all and end-all, writing in a “correct” way\ndoes offer a baseline that all writers should build on. Producing\nfantastically literate, illustrative, and textured writing just doesn’t work\nif your spelling and grammar suck.\n\nTo achieve this baseline, I recommend grabbing a good book on the topic. There\nare plenty to choose from, but don’t feel you need to devote your life to it:\npick a short book that covers the main points, digest it, and use some of the\nadvice it presents. A great read that I recommend for those of you who want to\nbrush up on this is Strunk and White’s classic _The Elements of Style_\n(Longman). While you read and learn the topics, also look at other people’s\nwriting and try to learn what makes their writing structurally interesting and\nsimple to read.\n\nIf there is one piece of advice I would recommend more than any other, it is\nto proofread your work extensively. Proofreading offers an excellent chance to\nread the piece and ensure that it structurally fits together.\n\nLet’s use this chapter as an example. If you take a look at the range of\ncontent that is covered, it has been laid out in a very specific way. The\ncontent has been structured to discuss different topics, each building on what\nwent before. As I write these words right now, I have already written a\nsignificant chunk of content for the chapter, and although I could proofread\nthis specific section on “The mechanics of writing,” I need to proofread the\nentire chapter to ensure that this section fits in and flows correctly.\n\nWhen many people write, they first create the main chunk of text and then read\nthe whole piece again as their proofreading pass. This is fine, but I would\nencourage one more step before the proofread: read the entire piece aloud.\nAlthough this may sound a little crazy for a piece that is intended to be read\nsilently, reading your content aloud can be hugely valuable in finding badly\nwritten sentences that don’t flow well.\n\nCultural Differences in Writing\n\nOne additional element you should be aware of is just how much writing varies\naround the world, even within the same language. Aside from some of the\nspelling differences (e.g., color and colour, prioritise and prioritize),\nthere are also changes in language use itself.\n\nOne example of this is how active the voice is. Some countries speak in a very\npassive voice (e.g., “Today this was done by the group”), whereas some use a\nmore active voice (e.g., “Today the group did this”).\n\nYou should ensure that you write in the manner that most suitably targets your\naudience. If it is an open-ended audience, simply pick one approach and use it\nconsistently.\n\n### Don’t write like an institution\n\nWhen I was at university, I used to write articles about Linux and technology.\nThe work was great for furthering my career while also funding my somewhat\nludicrous lifestyle of working and partying.\n\nI eventually went on to make writing my career when I graduated. Each day I\nwould write countless articles for various magazines, and throughout this time\nI focused my radar on all manner of different topics. While most of my\nresearch was performed online or on the phone, much of my in-person research\ntime was spent in press conferences.\n\nPress conferences and engagements were interesting beasts, mostly following\nthe same formula. We the press would represent the cynics of the world, and\nthe marketing folk would represent the optimists of the world. They fed the\npress not only coffee and small sausage rolls, but also a diet of unparalleled\nmarketing nonsense.\n\nThroughout my career as a journalist I witnessed example after example in\nwhich concepts and topics were dressed up with buzzword-laden diatribes that\nwere often so jam-packed with marketing fluff that it would be barely\nunderstandable for us tech media hacks, let alone the average Joe.\n\nOne of the finest (read: most disturbing) examples of this happened when an\norganization (that shall remain nameless) sent me one of its new press\nreleases. As I sat there one morning sipping my coffee, desperately trying to\nwake up, I was presented with this humdinger of a no-nonsense buzzfest:\n\n> Program Focuses On Helping The Open Source Ecosystem Grow Sustainable\n> Businesses By Implementing A Community-Leveraged Model\n\nUnfortunately, the literary smackdown didn’t end there. It went on to say:\n\n> XXXXXXXXXX, a leading provider of commercial open source middleware\n> solutions for database high availability, today announced XXXXXXXXXX. The\n> program is focused on creating a rising tide for the broader open source\n> ecosystem, and is focused on leveraging community-driven development and\n> frictionless distribution to extend the ecosystem.\n\nThe language in this press release was by no means unusual. Plenty of\ncompanies would send paragraph after paragraph of overcooked verbiage pouring\ninto my inbox across press releases, briefings, product announcements, and\nother material.\n\nOf course, there was a lot of sense in targeting writing to a specific\naudience and using language and references that are meaningful to that\ndemographic (many of which were businesses and buyers). Unfortunately, in many\nof these cases the abundance of completely meaningless bluster manufactured in\nmarketing meetings with the intention of sounding professional merely\ncomplicated as opposed to clarifying the matter.\n\nYou should be careful to not fall into this trap. If you bring out the big\nliterary guns with your community, you face the risk of not only confusing\npeople but also agitating them. Remember, communities thrive on clarity and\ntransparency: if you start talking like a slick-haired marketing copywriter,\nsome members of your community are likely to interpret your words as dressed-\nup claptrap. Speak with your own voice and you avoid this problem. If you are\na community manager who reports to a marketing department, this may seem like\nquite a challenge. Instead, see it as part of your responsibility and talent\nin helping to translate between these two sets of language so that you can\ndeliver the message in the right way.\n\nOne of the widest-respected writing teachers, William Zinsser, speaks\nextensively on this topic in his seminal _On Writing Well_ (Harper Perennial),\na book devoted to writing clearly. When I started writing for O’Reilly, the\nnice folks there kindly sent me a copy of the book. As I sat curled up on my\ncouch reading it one afternoon, one paragraph in particular on this topic\nleaped out at me:\n\n> Just because people work for an institution, they don’t have to write like\n> one. Institutions can be warmed up. Administrators can be turned into human\n> beings. Information can be imparted clearly and without pomposity. You only\n> have to remember that readers identify with people, not with abstractions\n> like “profitability,” or with Latinate nouns like “utilization” and\n> “implementation,” or with inert constructions in which nobody can be\n> visualized doing something: “pre-feasibility studies are in the paperwork\n> stage.”\n\nZinsser is a staunch advocate of clear writing. He believes the enemy of great\nwriting is the modern expectation that writing must be laced with buzzwords\nand meaningless terms to make it sound “more professional.” Earlier, when we\ndiscussed that “it’s not the notes you play, it’s the notes you don’t play,”\nthe professionalism that many seek to achieve in writing is absolutely the\nnotes you don’t play. These meaningless buzzwords are the equivalent of\nslamming your hands on the piano to get attention.\n\n### Untwisting the tail\n\nAs I step down from my high horse, I have to acknowledge that distilling\ncomplex processes and concepts into simple language without blinding people\nwith science or meaningless words is really quite hard. It takes skill to\nexplain these topics in a way that is clear, easy to read, and devilishly\nsimple to understand. While I am eager not to turn _The Art of Community_ into\na creative writing textbook, let’s look at one quick example in which complex\nissues are communicated easily and effectively, in a world intimately familiar\nwith verbosity: _licensing_.\n\nCreative Commons is an organization that produces a set of free licenses that\nallows content producers to freely license their work. Founded by highly\nrespected law professor Lawrence Lessig, Creative Commons has gone on to\nachieve remarkable success, and thousands of artists are licensing a range of\nmusic, video, art, and other creative endeavors under its range of licenses.\nEach of its licenses promotes and encourages a so-called Free Culture—that is,\nthe freedom to share, remix, and derive from existing work. Its range of\nlicenses provides different levels of these freedoms depending on the desires\nof the artist.\n\nThe creation and free availability of these licenses is a wonderful gift from\nCreative Commons, but an even more impressive contribution is the ease with\nwhich the licenses can be understood. An example of this is the Creative\nCommons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. This is the very license\nunder which _The Art of Community_ is published. [Figure\n3-1](ch03.html#simplification_of_licensing_from_the_cre \"Figure 3-1. Creative\nCommons provides this simplified summary of how the license works.\") shows\nwhat the license looks like.\n\n![Creative Commons provides this simplified summary of how the license\nworks.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159251.png)\n\nFigure 3-1. Creative Commons provides this simplified summary of how the\nlicense works.\n\nTraditionally, licenses have been ugly beasts. They haven’t evolved far toward\nreadability, and they include reams and reams of complicated legal mumbo jumbo\nto confuse the poor artist.\n\nCreative Commons developed the concept of the Commons Deed, shown in the\nfigure, which showcases the primary features of the license in a simple, easy-\nto-read, and visual way. It managed to transpose these attributes of a license\nin such a way that is simple for an artist to learn and apply to his work. It\nmade perfect sense: if the licenses were too complicated to understand and\nuse, artists will either (a) not use the licenses or (b) more worryingly, pick\na license that they don’t understand and suffer negative consequences around\nthe use of their work in the future.\n\nTo help improve the accessibility of its licenses, Creative Commons produces\ntwo documents for each one. First is the full-blown legal document with the\nnitty-gritty of how the whole deal works. If a case ever got to court, this\nlegal smörgåsbord would be the primary point of reference. That document is\ngreat for the legal eagles, but not for artists. As such, Creative Commons\nthen went on to convert this 3,000-plus-word document into the simple Commons\nDeed shown in [Figure 3-1](ch03.html#simplification_of_licensing_from_the_cre\n\"Figure 3-1. Creative Commons provides this simplified summary of how the\nlicense works.\"). Creative Commons realized that licensing simply needed to be\neasier to understand for the real consumers and propagators of the licenses:\nan exercise in clear and targeted writing.\n\nZinsser’s earlier observation about not writing like an institution is an\nimportant lesson when documenting all aspects of your community, but\nparticularly processes. When producing documents that you want your community\nto read and act on, don’t be lured into filling them with meaningless\nbuzzwords, overly complex descriptions, and other fluff. Take Zinsser’s advice\nand try to write and produce documents that are simple, easy to read, and\ndesigned for the audience who should read them. Simplicity in writing will\nensure that your community can do great work easily.\n\nMe, Myself, and I\n\nA useful tip for writing clearly and humanly is to write as if you’re talking\nto a colleague or friend sitting next to you. That kind of clear but informal\nbanter makes the reader feel comfortable and cared for. This, combined with\nproofreading aloud, as we discussed earlier, is an excellent way to bring a\nconversational finesse to your writing.\n\n### Setting tone\n\nTone is an important element in all writing. Tone is the impression and “feel”\nthat you take away from a piece based on how it is written. Tone can often be\nsubtle and entirely subjective in how it is interpreted. Let’s look at an\nexample. Here are two different ways of writing a piece asking people to write\nreports about their work, each with a very different approach to the tone:\n\nWay 1\n\n    \n\nHi, everyone! As our community continues to grow and rock the world, it is\ndifficult to keep track of what we are all working on. As such, I think it\nwould be awesome to produce reports that can help us all to know what we are\ndoing. It should only take a few minutes, but it could be a great contribution\nand well worth the time. Thoughts? :)\n\nWay 2\n\n    \n\nHello. Could everyone please produce a series of reports for their work to\nfacilitate the community in understanding which work is being tended to? Thank\nyou.\n\nWith the first piece the tone is very open, friendly, and participatory. The\nlanguage is loose, and the writing openly asks for comments and feedback. The\nsecond piece is far more formal, and a little more demanding in asking people\nto provide reports. Although both are clearly written, the choice of words and\nstructure affects the tone.\n\nTone is hugely important when writing content for your community. Following on\nwith our “notes you play” quote, it is tone that is the finest example of “the\nnotes you don’t play.” The tone you choose can hugely affect how the piece is\ninterpreted.\n\nThere are two different elements to consider when thinking about the tone of\nyour writing:\n\nGeneral tone\n\n    \n\nOne of the most important considerations to make with your writing is the\ngeneral tone that you use throughout your communications. For most of us this\nis baked in: your tone is expressed each time you write, and it largely\nreflects your general personality. You should endeavor for your tone to be\nloose, open, friendly, and inviting. You should feel entirely comfortable\nabout mixing in humor, and you should write in a way that makes your community\nfeel like equals.\n\nContext-specific tone\n\n    \n\nDepending on the context, you will need to adjust your tone to be appropriate.\nThe choice of tone varies significantly between contexts that involve\nconflict, getting people excited, and governance topics.\n\nYour choice of tone and how you apply it will significantly affect how you are\nperceived in the community. This choice does require balance, though: being\ntoo happy-go-lucky can have the same effect as being a grumpy curmudgeon.\n\nImagine a line drawn in the sand in front of you. On the far left of the line\nis an overly chirpy, overly friendly, and potentially disingenuous level of\nbright smiles and happy thoughts. On the far right side of the line is a\ngrumpy, monotonic, miserable, and snappy approach. Although it is easy to see\nhow those on the far right will rattle people’s cages, those on the far left\ncreate not only potential annoyance and frustration, but also mistrust: if\nsomeone is over-the-top happy in his communication to everyone, it could be\ninterpreted that the person is doing it for effect and not being honest with\nthe community. As ever, a balance is needed. Be yourself: err to the left side\nof the line, as we like friendly people, but use your best judgment to\ndetermine how far toward Happyville you edge.\n\nWithin the realm of tone, many different people take different approaches;\nsome work well and some don’t. Compare and contrast the frankness and pointed\ntone used by a New York investment banker and the friendly and submissive tone\nof a San Francisco charity worker. Let’s now look at some ingredients that can\nbe used when considering your tone and how they can affect your community:\n\nSeriousness\n\n    \n\nCommunities react very differently to seriousness in different scenarios. As a\ngeneral rule, you should keep your community loose and informal, but at times\nyou will need to be serious and focused. You should fully expect a more\nserious tone when discussing conflict, governance topics, or personal problems\nwith a specific community member.\n\nHumor\n\n    \n\nHumor is a huge boon when used correctly with community. If you are funny,\nyour community will likely take to you, but your humor needs to (a) actually\nwork (yes, you need to actually be funny) and (b) not distract the audience\nfrom the topic. You need to always ensure that your humor matches the context.\nFor example, humor in an emergency meeting will probably go down like a lead\nballoon.\n\nWit\n\n    \n\nClosely related to humor is wit. If you are quick-witted, particularly in an\namusing way, it can bring a loose and fun atmosphere to your community. One\nrisk you should be aware of, though, is to not use your lightning-fast wit to\nembarrass or show up a fellow community member. Also, wit is typically not\nvery welcome in contentious or argumentative scenarios, so tread carefully\nthere.\n\nFrankness\n\n    \n\nBeing frank and to the point can be received in many different ways. Some\npeople who receive this kind of to-the-point approach will respond with a very\ndefensive and confrontational tone, whereas others will relish your frankness.\nTake the pulse of the people you are talking to, and adjust this element of\ntone based on how well you think they will react.\n\nYour choices and approach to tone will adjust, grow, and mature over time. As\nwith everything else when working on your communication, it is always valuable\nto look below the surface of other people’s communications to learn how they\nhave approached situations. As an example, if you are dealing with a\ncontentious situation, look at the tone of how others have responded and learn\nfrom them. You may also want to directly ask people who have been there before\nfor advice. We will be looking into conflict resolution situations extensively\nin [Chapter 11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\").\n\nSometimes We All Suck\n\nOne attribute of tone that I have always found compelling is those who are\nwilling to be slightly self-deprecating. This is a particularly welcome trait\nin leaders: when a leader is willing to joke about herself or her situation,\nit can often help warm her reception to others.\n\nNaturally, you should do this only if you feel comfortable doing so. Faking\nself-deprecation just sounds patronizing.\n\n### Inspiring your community\n\nOne of the most fundamental qualities that a community leader can bring to a\ncommunity is inspiration. At their heart, communities are collections of\npeople united by a shared ethos and most typically by a shared opportunity and\ngoal. Not only does inspiration bolster everyone’s commitment and excitement\naround that goal, but it can also build a sense of unity and togetherness that\nis essential for a thriving community.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no recipe or formula that teaches you how to inspire.\nInspiration is a hugely complex topic to teach, because it is heavily\ndependent on your approach and the kind of community that you have. Part of\nthe reason for this is that your approach is, in itself, also highly dependent\non you as a human being.\n\nBeing able to inspire is based heavily on whether you are believable as an\ninspirational figure, and your approach needs to reflect you as a person. As\nan example, if you are a generally fun, jovial person but try to deliver a\nWinston Churchill monologue, it will be laughable at best and seen as a\ndesperate attempt for validation at worst. On the flip side, if you are a\nserious and forthright person and you deliver a George Carlin-style comedic\nslap-down, your audience will probably feel the same way they do when they see\ntheir dads edging toward the dance floor at a wedding. You need to match the\napproach to inspiration with what qualities and attributes you as a person\nalready have. When you make inspiration your own, it becomes other people’s\ninspiration.\n\nThe best advice I have for writing inspirationally is to discover who and what\ninspires you and learn from it. Everyone has his own individual answer to this\nquestion. Some are inspired by musicians, authors, politicians, and people\nrelated to their field of interest or expertise. For me, one of my most\nsignificant inspirations is the unique combination of Aaron Sorkin and Martin\nSheen.\n\nSorkin was the writing genius behind _The West Wing_ , a show written about\nthe goings-on of an American administration in the West Wing of the White\nHouse. Every time I watch the show, I feel inspired by the dialogue. I love\nthe way the characters speak to one another. I love how their directness of\nconversation is underlined with humility and humor. Being the ultra _West\nWing_ nerd that I am, I have every episode on DVD, and those shiny little\ndiscs are littered with incredible examples of inspiring writing and the\nmasterful delivery of that writing by Martin Sheen as the president. Whenever\nI watch the show, my own use of language changes a little and my own approach\nto writing adjusts a little more. It inspires me.\n\nWe should, though, keep things in perspective: _The West Wing_ was written by\na skilled team of writers who spent every day working to make those little\nhairs on the back of your neck stand on end. It is important not to judge\nyourself too heavily in what you produce. When you find your inspiration, pick\nit apart and try to discover what about it inspires you, but ensure that you\nmerely use it as a guide. Don’t expect to become the next Aaron Sorkin\novernight. Just focus on the most immediate goal of learning, sharing your\nthoughts using what you have learned, and seeing how your community reacts.\n\nFinding Your Inspiration\n\nYou should spend some time trying to figure out where you find yourself\nthinking and writing inspirational thoughts and ideas. For some it is in the\nshower, when taking a walk, or while lounging around in bed. Everyone is\ndifferent. All people have times when they feel inspired and creative.\n\nThe next time you feel inspired, note what you were doing when it happened. It\nis likely you will see a correlation. When you know what the magic scenario\nis, you can trigger it and get some more quality inspiration time!\n\n# Summary\n\nThroughout this chapter we have explored some of the many topics involved in\nbuilding a culture of simple, powerful, and effective communication. While all\nof the topics covered in this chapter are firmly seated in the “communication\nbest practices” category, it should be noted that effective communication is\nsomething we should exercise across all of our community-building efforts.\n\nWith this solid chunk of great communication best practice under our belts,\nlet’s continue our application of simplicity to community by applying it to an\narea often bastardized by utter complexity: building _processes_. Fasten those\nseat belts, friends.\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n[1] To learn why, visit\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_Law_of_Triviality>.\n\n\n# Chapter 4. Processes: Simple Is Sustainable\n\n“Light is the task where many share the toil.”\n\n—Homer\n\nRay Kroc was a fairly simple guy. As a small-time salesman in the 1950s, he\nhad moved on from the thrill-seeking paper cup world to selling multimixer\ndrink machines to restaurants across the US. His machines allowed anyone with\nrudimentary operating abilities to create a delicious, creamy milkshake that\nwas so thick it required the power of a thousand vacuum cleaners to suck it up\nthe straw.\n\nKroc’s machines were a hit, and it wasn’t long before his path crossed with\nthat of Dick and Mac McDonald, owners of a small restaurant chain called\nMcDonald’s. A partnership was born, but Kroc’s ambitions went way beyond\nmilkshake-making machines. His ambitions also went way beyond those of Dick\nand Mac. Before long, Kroc purchased the chain and started growing his empire.\n\nFrom these humble beginnings McDonald’s continued to grow, and now serves over\n47 million people every day. Kroc, starting with his inventive approach to\nmilkshakes, died with a fortune of over $500 million. Boy, that is a lot of\nmilkshakes.\n\nLove it or hate it, McDonald’s has been hugely successful. Its food is cheap,\nreadily accessible, efficient (in an increasingly busy world), and typically\nof acceptable quality. Of course, some of you will disagree with that last\npart, but let’s put any gripes to one side for a moment. I am more interested\nin the mechanics behind the meals.\n\nWith 31,000+ restaurants in over 119 countries, McDonald’s has an average of\n1,500+ customers every day in each of its establishments. Its menu is packed\nwith products, each of which has its own preparation method, ingredients, and\nform of presentation. But let’s be honest: the average McDonald’s employee is\nnot exactly a master chef. Most of the people who work at McDonald’s are\nuntrained, and the training they do get is rudimentary. McDonald’s low cost in\nterms of staff is a key area in which it competes effectively—but how does it\ndo it?\n\nLike Henry Ford before it, McDonald’s has broken complex processes into sets\nof steps that almost anyone can replicate. If you were going to cook fries at\nhome, you’d have to consider a lot of variables: the time it takes to heat the\noil, how small you need to cut the potatoes, cooking time, how much salt to\nsprinkle on top of the fries, and how to avoid inadvertently plunging your\nhand in the oil (an ever-present risk when I am in the kitchen). McDonald’s\nhas eliminated the need for this range of knowledge by converting the cooking\nprocess into a series of simpler steps: unpacking boxes, filling containers,\npressing buttons, and so on. McDonald’s has perfected process simplification.\n\nThe inverse of simplification is complexity, and we don’t like complexity\naround these parts. Complex processes are ugly beasts, and their effect is to\nmerely build _bureaucracy_.\n\nYou need to avoid this 11-letter word at all costs. Bureaucracy is the enemy\nin this chapter: it is the vitriol that breaks down the opportunity,\npotential, and belief that we celebrated so strongly earlier in this book.\nGreat processes blend into the background, functioning as required and as\nexpected. Great processes let people get on with doing real, human,\ninteresting things. Bad processes serve as nothing more than a dartboard for\nyour contributors to throw their frustration at.\n\nGreat processes are our aim in this chapter. We are going to assess the many\nand varied processes involved in your community, break them down into steps,\nand make them as simple and effective as possible. Processes are everywhere in\ncommunities, determining how:\n\n  * New people join\n\n  * People submit contributions\n\n  * People collaborate with one another\n\n  * People deal with conflict, and so on\n\nIt is no coincidence that the word _people_ is in each of those examples.\nPeople are the foundation of community, and for us to ensure that these people\ncan work well together, we need to focus on people as the foundation of our\nprocesses.\n\nWhen we (a) know which processes we need to create and (b) make these\nprocesses delightfully simple, our community members can get on with enjoying\nthe community that they signed up for.\n\n# Eyes on the Prize\n\nOne of the challenges of writing a chapter about processes is that they are so\nabstract. The word _process_ is unspecific: it describes a set of steps that\nachieves something. For newcomers to the subject, this is difficult to get\nyour head around without specific examples of processes. This could include\nthe examples we just spoke of: how new people join your community, submit\ncontributions, collaborate, and deal with conflict.\n\nWhen thinking of how to approach this chapter, as well as the wider book, I am\nkeen to not merely provide you with answers to specific problems. This reminds\nme of the old Chinese proverb:\n\n> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you\n> feed him for a lifetime.\n\nI want to teach you all how to fish. I want the content in this book to help\nyou grow and build best practices that can be applied in a range of scenarios.\nThis absolutely applies to processes.\n\nBut this brings us back to our original conundrum: processes can be a little\nabstract and difficult to understand if not accompanied by an example. As\nsuch, as you read this chapter always consider how you can apply the content\nto the examples we discussed earlier, such as encouraging new members into\nyour project.\n\nThroughout this chapter we will discuss how to build processes that are smooth\nand effective, explore what is important to consider when building them,\nidentify our needs, and document and communicate them in our community.\n\n## Keeping Things in Perspective\n\nRight now I can imagine that some of you are not exactly exhilarated at the\nidea of reading a chapter all about processes. I admit that even I, while\nplanning this book, was initially hesitant about devoting a chapter to\nprocesses. Some of you may see processes as a waste of time, an overly formal\nmind game that makes life less fun for everyone involved. Some of you may even\ngo so far as suggesting that to define processes is to limit community and\nentangle its members in rules. But just invert this oversimplification and you\nwill be closer to the truth: well-thought-out, simple, and well-documented\nprocesses enable your community members to do their real work easily and\neffectively.\n\nHere is the crux of how we frame this perspective: processes are useful when\nthey become a means to an end. I don’t want to overplay the importance of\nconstructing processes, but I do want to stress the importance of the\nactivities that they implement. In other words, making it easy for new members\nto join your project is really important, but the process that makes this\nhappen should never overshadow the end goal. A consciousness of processes is\ngood; obsessing over them is bad and breeds bureaucracy. We always need to\nkeep our eyes on the prize.\n\nI raise this distinction for an important reason: building processes is a core\nactivity in governing a group of people. Unfortunately, all too often the act\nof governing can overtake the goals of the governance. Always bear this in\nmind when building your processes, and always ensure that you are not building\nprocesses for the sake of building processes. Not all problems can be solved\nwith documentation and rules.\n\n## The Impact of Processes\n\nShortly after I joined Canonical in 2006 I underwent an experience that\nchanged the way I saw my role as a community manager and how I build effective\nprocesses.\n\nI was working at home one day when I got an email that told a stunning story.\nThe sender was a kid (unfortunately, I can’t remember his name) who was living\nwith his family in a remote region of Africa. Some time ago some visitors had\ncome to his village and these visitors had laptops that were running Ubuntu\n(the software we produce at Canonical).\n\nWhen the kid asked these people what was on their computers and they mentioned\nUbuntu, it immediately resonated: the word _ubuntu_ is an ancient African word\nmeaning _“humanity to others_.” This piqued the kid’s interest and he asked\nfor more information about the software. They then told him how the software\nwas entirely open and created by a global community who worked together to\ncreate software that people could share with one another. Although the kid had\nspent little time in front of computers (he didn’t own one and had no access\nto the Internet), he was absolutely fascinated by the premise of Ubuntu and\nopen source and this culture of sharing. He felt compelled to participate.\n\nHe told me that, to earn money, on weekdays he would do odd jobs and bits of\nwork around his village when he was not at school, and then on the weekends he\nwould walk three hours to the nearest town and spend his money in an Internet\ncafé, where he would pay for an hour’s worth of Internet time and use it to\ncontribute to Ubuntu. After his hour was up he would walk three hours back to\nhis village, excited about his contributions. He did this every weekend and\ntold me that all week he would look forward to the weekend to contribute to\nUbuntu.\n\nI was moved by this email. Not only did it demonstrate the sheer humanity and\ngood nature of this kid, but it also demonstrated how powerful inspiration and\ncommunity can move people.\n\nImportantly, though, and related to this chapter, it gave me a new way to\ndefine and assess my work. My job was simple: to help that kid get the most\nout of his hour. If he was spending his week earning money to contribute to\nUbuntu, and was willing to walk six hours in one day to contribute to our\ncommunity, it was my responsibility to help him not only enjoy his hour, but\nalso have few, if any, obstacles and barriers to overcome in order to\nparticipate. This meant ensuring that the processes that were part of Ubuntu\nwere slim, efficient, and designed to help our contributors achieve great\nthings.\n\n# Building Great Processes\n\nProcesses are everywhere. There is a process to withdraw money from your bank\naccount. There is a process to change the oil in your car. And of course, any\ninteraction with the government…well, I am sure you can end that sentence\nyourself. Unfortunately, many people who interact with processes experience\nlittle reward for a lot of frustration.\n\nProcesses are like television news: we only ever hear the negative stories.\nTelevision news favors accounts of murders and accidents over local charity\nsuccess stories and animal rescues. In the same manner, the only processes we\never hear about are often problematic ones: people queuing for two hours to\nmail a package, piles of forms we have to fill out to file taxes, and the\nhoops we have to jump through to buy insurance. Believe me, even though I have\nwritten this chapter, I hate bad processes just as much as you do.\n\nProcesses that don’t work, suck, plain and simple. Some process failures are\nfar more dramatic than others, though, and can have very severe human\nramifications. One such example is the product recall. In _[Process\nImprovement Essentials](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596102173.do)_\n(O’Reilly), author James R. Persse talks up product recalls and the insights\nthey offer:\n\n> As a rule, corporations like to keep their troubles quiet. They prefer to\n> keep their problems from showing up on the street. It can be embarrassing.\n> And it takes a lot of explanation to a lot of people who probably aren’t\n> prepared to appreciate that these things happen. Nobody’s perfect. Defects\n> happen.\n\nWe are all familiar with product recalls, those little notices in supermarkets\nand newspapers that indicate that something went horribly wrong when the\nproduct was created. Recalls are bad for business because they say, very\nclearly, that the manufacturer’s quality assurance processes don’t work.\nWhether nuts contaminated a nut-free zone, pieces of glass broke into a large\nvat of baby food, or a batch of eggs was exposed to salmonella, product\nrecalls point the giant finger of blame in the general direction of the\nmanufacturing process. These recalls not only destroy faith in brands, but\nalso cause concern in customers, and sometimes even panic.\n\nBad processes are one thing, but a process that nearly costs people their\nfingers is something entirely different. Persse shares with us the curious\ncase of the Chevrolet Venture minivan debacle:\n\n> Take the Chevrolet Venture for example. This popular minivan ran into\n> something of a quality problem in the late 1990s. At issue was the\n> questionable design of its passenger seat latch. The company received data\n> that indicated maybe the latch had an operational defect. After some study,\n> Chevrolet determined that a general recall of the 1997 Venture was in order.\n> Here is an excerpt from the text of that recall notice: “RECALL NOTICE (1997\n> Chevrolet Venture): Passenger’s fingers could be severed by latch mechanism\n> that moves seat fore and aft (Consumer Reports 2005).”\n>\n> Now, as a general rule, severed fingers should not be a part of anyone’s\n> driving experience. What manufacturer would want that picture etched into\n> the brand image of their minivans? Chevrolet no doubt brought its forces to\n> bear. That latch was probably redesigned and re-manufactured against the\n> highest standards, with inordinate attention to detail: test after test,\n> exhausting verification runs, complete assurance of unquestionable\n> integrity. It wouldn’t surprise me if that latch today—almost 10 years\n> later—stands as the world-class epitome of efficiency and safety in seat\n> latch technology.\n\nThis was a pretty serious problem, to say the least. The outcome of a bad\nprocess (quality control) could have been disastrous. Aside from the obvious\nsafety problems with many recalls, the nightmare goes much further. Products\nare expensive to replace. Advertising the recall is expensive, too. Legal\nissues are likely to arise from embittered customers. Whether they involve a\nthousand and one tax forms to fill in or a latch that may sever your fingers,\nbad processes cause significant harm.\n\nSimilar risk applies to communities. When we take a laissez-faire approach to\nprocesses, we put confidence in our community at risk. Processes are the\nconceptual buttons that your community members push to make things happen, and\nwhen those buttons don’t work as expected, people get bored and frustrated and\nmove on. On the other hand, if we craft smooth, efficient, and effective\nprocesses, our community feels nimble, responsive, and great to be part of.\n\n## Breaking Up the Puzzle\n\nBuilding a quality process is like taking a road trip. You know where you want\nto go. You want to take the shortest route, and you want to avoid as many\nbottlenecks and problems as possible. When you plan your perfect route, you\nare careful to take the fewest number of roads, take advantage of available\nfreeways/motorways, avoid rush hour, regularly check on current road\nconditions, and ensure that an In-N-Out Burger restaurant is on the route at\nregular points (that’s just my personal criterion...).\n\nYou should take the same approach to efficiency with your processes. How can\nyou achieve what you want as quickly and efficiently as possible? How can you\ncommunicate the journey as easily as possible to new members? How can you\nensure that your processes are always amenable to current conditions?\n\nGreat processes are beautiful creatures, but they need care and feeding to\nthrive. Our goal in this chapter is to identify these needs and produce\nprocesses that exhibit the following criteria:\n\nThe goal of the process is achieved as quickly as possible\n\n    \n\nThe quicker a process ends, the quicker your community can get on with more\ninteresting things.\n\nThe fewest possible steps can achieve the goal\n\n    \n\nRedundant steps merely make the process feel long and drawn out; let’s avoid\nthat.\n\nEach step is simple, well documented, and clearly communicated\n\n    \n\nEach step should be absolutely necessary, and performing it should be simple.\nA quick technical example: if you need someone to type something in, don’t\ndemand case-sensitivity; it only complicates that step.\n\nThe process is as friction-free as possible\n\n    \n\nWe want to avoid confusion and annoyance, not only with each step in the\nprocess, but also in the process as a whole.\n\nQuality is maintained at every step\n\n    \n\nWe need to identify and maintain the different types of quality involved in a\nprocess: its accuracy at achieving the outcome, how efficient it is, how well\ndocumented it is, how current it is, and how open to change and improvement it\nis.\n\nAlthough we will talk about it shortly, _simplicity_ is the foundation of all\ngood processes. As an example, consider how members join your community. How\ncan you develop a process that is as easy as possible to follow and simple to\nexplain to others? Put yourself in the position of a new community member who\nhas no idea how to join your community. How can you learn how to get involved\nand get there in as few steps as possible? When this is as efficient as\npossible, you have a much better chance of recruiting new members.\n\nContinuing the example, some communities have incredibly elaborate processes\nfor how people join. They require applications, supporting evidence,\nmembership council votes, signed documentation, agreement to terms and\nconditions, and more. Some communities are far simpler, merely requiring\nsomeone to participate in a discussion. Your community will be somewhere\nbetween these two points, and although only your community can really decide\nwhere this is, our discussion throughout this chapter should help you\ndetermine this.\n\n### Building a process\n\nEarlier in this book we created our strategic plan. In it we produced a set of\n_objectives_ and _goals_ , each of which we broke into steps and documented.\nThis approach is also excellent for building processes, albeit with a\ndifferent set of criteria.\n\nWhen you need to build a process for something (such as how members join your\ncommunity), note the following criteria:\n\nGoal\n\n    \n\nWhat is the goal of the process? What does it seek to achieve? What is the\noutcome when the process has been followed?\n\nTarget participants\n\n    \n\nWho is the process designed for? Is it intended for a particular kind of\ncontributor, such as a developer, documentation writer, translator, or\nadvocate?\n\nRequirements\n\n    \n\nWhat tools, knowledge, and experience must the contributor have in order to\nfollow through with the process? If she does not possess these requirements,\nhow can she obtain them easily? Are these requirements a barrier to entry\n(such as entry fees or limited availability)?\n\nSteps involved\n\n    \n\nWhat are the chronological steps involved in achieving the goal? What could go\nwrong? Is it possible for people to accidentally fail to complete a step? How\nis feedback provided about each step? Who provides the feedback?\n\nVerification\n\n    \n\nWho decides when a process has been completed successfully? Also, how is\nsuccessful completion of the process communicated to the contributor?\n\nLet us now apply these criteria to our previous example of a contributor\njoining a community.\n\nIn our example we are the members of a small open source project that is\nworking on a video game that pits open source community managers against one\nanother with the stylings of Street Fighter II. Naturally I would expect my\nown representation to be somewhat more muscular and toned than the sad example\nof my real body.\n\nAs this is an open source project, we want to encourage people to contribute\ncode (such as a patch to crank up my muscles). For developers to contribute,\nthough, they need to have access to the code repository. Before we give them\nthis access, we need a process that helps them contribute some code that we\ncan assess first, so we can ensure that only capable developers can contribute\ndirectly to the repository.\n\nLet’s now apply to this example the set of questions we discussed earlier.\nHere are some answers:\n\n  * Goal: To assess developer contributions, and if approved, permit direct access to the repository.\n\n  * Audience: Developers with some experience in the project.\n\n  * Requirements: Development experience, interaction with the community with regard to software development.\n\n  * Steps Involved:\n\n    * Developer can email patches to existing developers or attach them to bugs.\n\n    * Developer creates an application page on the contributor wiki with:\n\n      * Name.\n\n      * Email address.\n\n      * List of patches contributed and a link to their commit email.\n\n      * Any additional notes.\n\n      * Applicant waits for a decision within one week.\n\n  * Verification: The core development team.\n\nIf you are not technically savvy, don’t be thrown off by terms like _patch_\nand _commit email_ ; they’re not really important. The value in this example\nis how it outlines the core structure behind a typical process. Also note that\nthis process does not cover specifically how the existing development team\nassesses these applications from new developers: that would be its own\nseparate process.\n\n### Note\n\nLater in this chapter, we are going to dig into more detail about how to make\nit as simple as possible for contributors to join your community.\n\nIn a few pages we will determine what process needs you have for your\ncommunity and then apply this formula to those needs. First, though, I want to\ntalk through a few additional important best-practice considerations when\nthinking about processes in general.\n\n## Process Considerations\n\nThe art of building effective processes is in not forgetting the big picture\nwhen fleshing out the details. Processes get very granular very quickly. It is\neasy to sometimes get lost in the details and forget some of our wider\nambitions.\n\nTo complement our approach to fleshing out process criteria, let us now\nexplore some of the key themes that make good processes. These key themes\nshould be at the forefront of our minds while we work.\n\n### Simplicity is key\n\nLife is pretty complex, and modern technology seems to exacerbate as much as\nrelieve that complexity. Take the now-somewhat-archaic example of the VCR. For\nyears, thousands tried to set their VCR to achieve a seemingly simple task:\ntape a show at a specific time. Unfortunately, many of us failed. We heard\nendless horror stories of missed tapings of _Falcon Crest_ , _Days of Our\nLives_ , and other such travesties (sounds like a blessing in disguise to me).\nVCRs seemed to just confuse the heck out of many of us. There are similar\nexamples: car entertainment systems, computer software, automated ticketing\nmachines in parking garages, and online banking, to name a few.\n\nPart of the problem is that design and engineering have traditionally not been\nparticularly good bedfellows. This is not a new problem. Way back in 1847, Sir\nHenry Cole, one of the forefathers of industrial design, expressed his\nconcerns over this problem to The Society of Arts:\n\n> Of high art in this country there is abundance, of mechanical industry and\n> invention an unparalleled profusion. The thing still remaining to be done is\n> to effect the combination of the two, to wed high art with mechanical skill.\n> The union of the artist and the workman, the improvement of the general\n> taste of our artificers, and of the workmen in general; this is a task\n> worthy of The Society of Arts and directly in its path of duty.\n\nCole was suggesting that we approach mechanical inventions with the mind of an\nartist and vice versa. He understood that artists and designers have a fresh\napproach to how we think and interact with things. He also understood that\nengineers can build reliable and useful inventions. When we combine this\nunderstanding of the human psyche with the ability to build devices, machines\nbecome easier to operate and invariably look less like something that I myself\nwould bodge together in my garage.\n\nExamples of simplicity are everywhere. Andy Oram, who has lovingly edited this\nbook alongside Simon St. Laurent, shared one such example of this with me.\nAndy had a conversation once with a user interface expert about a quiz program\nhe had developed. His interface was good, but could have been better. It\nworked like this: first he had people create an account and then create and\nsave a quiz. Andy’s user interface mentor suggested he let people create the\nquiz right off the bat on the first screen. This meant the user could sign up\nfor an account if she decided the quiz was worth saving. This suggested change\nwas a simple example of optimizing a process and removing a barrier to\nparticipation. This is exactly what we want to achieve.\n\n### Avoiding bureaucracy\n\nWhile writing this book, I experienced something of a disaster. As I was\ntalking to my wife one evening about some Ubuntu work I was doing, I was\ngesticulating and inadvertently threw wine all over my laptop. Seemingly not\nsatisfied with my quota of laptop abuse, a few days later I managed to also\nthrow tea all over the poor blighter. I, my friends, am a clod. Said laptop\ncomplained and refused to switch on. As such, a replacement was needed, so I\nhopped online and ordered myself a snazzy new machine. And thus the pain\nbegan....\n\nIn the space of the following week, I was tortured by customer support. Issues\nwith a credit card payment, and need to use another credit card? Problem. I\nneed to register a card and wait 24 hours. Entirely incompetent staff. Want to\nspeak to a supervisor straightaway? Problem. I am entered into a queue, and\nwill get a call in 24 hours. Laptop arrives and fails to switch on.... Can a\nreplacement be ordered automatically? Problem. I have to first wait for a\nrefund, manually reorder the laptop, and wait for it to be built and\ndispatched. I was not a happy boy.\n\nI am sure all of you can report similar experiences. Each of these\nfrustrations was caused by bad processes. We learn from such experiences that\nan organization must not only create a simple process, but also set up\nancillary processes that kick into action when something goes wrong. The\nproblem during my laptop order sprang from a company that was thinking like a\ncompany and not like a human; in other words, it set up processes that were\nconvenient for its organizational structure and resources, not responsive to\ncustomers.\n\nMany of these problems could have been avoided with feedback. The most\nimportant ingredient when building processes is an understanding of people and\ntheir expectations. And this understanding requires you to solicit feedback,\nalong with a culture devoted to always improving and refining your processes.\nWhen we understand and react to participants’ expectations, processes behave\nas participants expect them to. Part of the reason why feedback is so\nimportant is that it prevents bureaucracy: rules that are maintained because “\n_they are the rules_.”\n\nSpread the message in your community that tomorrow may always bring a better\nway to carry out a current process. Processes provide an excellent opportunity\nto simplify tasks, tend to needs, and help your community focus on innovating\nmore easily.\n\nEncourage and enthuse your community to question your processes. This feedback\nwill keep your processes on their toes and protected from the dreaded B-word.\n\n### Transparency\n\nAnother distinctive benefit of feedback is to bring an air of transparency and\nopenness into your community. When people can contribute their thoughts and\nopinions, and those views get rolled back into community processes, openness\nis achieved.\n\nAll volunteer communities thrive on a sense of openness, because they are\n_associative_. These communities are built by people who choose to live their\nlives there. People who participate in a volunteer community do so because\nthey enjoy it: it is not a job or a requirement. As such, to keep them\ninvolved, there needs to be a sense that their input is valuable, and this\nabsolutely applies to their input on how well community processes are working.\nAsk yourself this question: would you rather live in a community where you can\nhave an impact on the governing rules, or a community in which other people\ndecide?\n\nUnfortunately, not all communities get this right. Back in March 2003, the\nxFree86 project was struggling with transparency. xFree86 was a free\nimplementation of X, the core windowing system that many Linux, BSD, and Unix\nsystems relied on. Everyone with a graphical interface on those systems was\nalmost certainly using xFree86.\n\nBack then, the processes and procedures that outlined how developers joined\nthe project were minimal, undocumented (or unknown), and restrictive. The\ndirectors of the xFree86 Corporation dictated these processes, even though the\ntechnical direction and leadership of the project had traditionally been\ngoverned by the xFree86 Core Team (composed of the main xFree86 developers).\n\nOne person who was deeply unhappy with this was Keith Packard, a core X\ndeveloper who was working at Hewlett-Packard at the time (see\n<http://www.xfree86.org/pipermail/forum/2003-March/002165.htm>):\n\n> While the xFree86 Board of Directors is nominally in charge of xFree86, they\n> have absented themselves from governing the project and left that to the\n> xFree86 Core Team. The community is left wondering who is actually in charge\n> of xFree86. As a result, community trust in xFree86 leadership has suffered.\n> Decisions appear to be arbitrary and are not seen to reflect the will of the\n> community. The leadership has no accountability to the community: thus\n> community members have no ability to change project direction and the Board\n> has little incentive to do so. In addition, the lack of clear formal\n> policies has made it difficult to resolve disputes when the usual consensus\n> breaks down.\n\nThis breakdown in governance and lack of clear, community-led processes had\nvery real ramifications for the project. Fewer developers were able to join.\nxFree86 development was slower than expected. Those projects that depended on\nxFree86 could not progress further due to technical limitations in X, so free\noperating systems were failing to benefit from the features and performance\noffered by new generations of graphics hardware. As a critical component in\nthe Linux desktop, xFree86 was holding everyone back. It was a real mess.\n\nUnfortunately, the bylaws of the community stated that any changes in\ngovernance had to be initiated by the directors of the xFree86 Corporation.\nThis was a problem. The board members were evidently not particularly\nresponsive or reactive to the concerns of the community, as Packard noted (see\n<http://www.xfree86.org/pipermail/forum/2003-March/002165.html>):\n\n> xFree86 has the trappings of democracy, but the community has no voting\n> rights and no elections are held.\n\nUltimately, the desire for openness and transparency won out. On January 22,\n2004, the X.org Foundation was formed. The new foundation brought the open\ngovernance and open processes that are common in open source to X. Since then,\nthe X Window System produced by the X.org community has thrived.\n\nThese risks with transparency can happen to any volunteer community. The\nsolution to this is simple: involve your community at every step of your\ncommunity growth. Involve them in the strategy, the processes, the governance,\nthe execution of these decisions, and more. Have public communication channels\nand public meetings, and instead of questioning whether something should be\npublic, question whether it should be private. When we work together, the\nworld feels like a very open place.\n\n# Assessing Needs\n\nEarlier in this book we explored many of the best-practice aspects of\ncommunity building and compiled a TODO list of these elements. One of these\nitems rather conveniently relates to our current discussion of processes.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Build an environment conducive to our wider goals.\n\nEffective environments are built on effective processes. As a community\nleader, your goal is to build an environment that offers rich opportunities\nand is simple to engage with. So you need to figure out which processes you\nrequire in your community and apply your recipe and best-practice concepts\nfrom earlier in the chapter.\n\nProcesses can be broadly divided into three primary categories:\n\nEnvironment and strategy\n\n    \n\nThis is a continuation of the strategy that we built earlier: the general\nconcepts that apply to everyone in your community, such as milestones,\ndirection, processes that define how people collaborate, and external\nfeedback.\n\nInfrastructure\n\n    \n\nThe technical nuts and bolts and tools of your community: the day-to-day\nfacilities that your community members require to get things done.\n\nGovernance\n\n    \n\nThe governing bodies, legislation, rules of engagement, and other, more\npolitical components required to organize and govern your community.\n\nEach of these areas is of significant importance in building a strong\ncommunity, and in this book I have devoted a chapter each to infrastructure\n([Chapter 5](ch05.html \"Chapter 5. Supporting Workflow with Tools and Data\"))\nand governance ([Chapter 10](ch10.html \"Chapter 10. Governance\")). Each of\nthose chapters helps you build effective processes in those respective areas\nusing the best practices described in this chapter.\n\nSo let’s now talk through some of the environment-related concepts that are\nimportant in our community. This will give you some handy examples that you\ncan apply to your own community.\n\n## Community Cycles\n\nMost communities, particularly collaborative ones, require some kind of\nplanning cycle. Whether you are working toward a software release, a\nconference, a local event, or something else, planning is key.\n\nMany of these objectives are reoccurring. Software regularly has releases.\nEvents regularly occur. In addition to this regularity, there are regular\nmilestones that need to be completed to achieve the objectives.\n\nOne such example is software. Most software releases adhere to the following\nbroad set of milestones:\n\n  1. Development begins.\n\n  2. Feature freeze.\n\n  3. User interface freeze.\n\n  4. Beta freeze.\n\n  5. Beta release.\n\n  6. Translations freeze.\n\n  7. Release candidate.\n\n  8. Final release.\n\nAnother example consists of the milestones involved in planning a local\ncommunity conference:\n\n  1. Planning begins.\n\n  2. Call for papers/exhibitors opens.\n\n  3. Final speaker list is chosen.\n\n  4. Final exhibitor list is chosen.\n\n  5. Schedule is published.\n\n  6. Venue equipment is finalized.\n\n  7. Event begins.\n\nFor both of these examples, the milestones combine in chronological order to\ndefine a cycle. If you have similar milestone-leading-to-goals requirements, I\nrecommend that you produce your own cycle.\n\n### Leading by example: Ubuntu\n\nUbuntu releases a new version every six months. Each release cycle involves a\nnumber of tasks: updating the toolchain, syncing and merging with the Debian\nrelease upon which Ubuntu is built, deciding on a direction at the Ubuntu\nDeveloper Summit, scheduling freezes, releasing alphas and betas, and other\nelements.\n\nAt the beginning of every release cycle, our release team documents the\nrelease cycle on the Ubuntu wiki. As an example, the 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope\nrelease cycle was documented at\n<https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JauntyReleaseSchedule>.\n\nThe release team broke down the cycle into a number of weeks, dividing the\nweeks into sections by month. Each week is placed into a table that has “Week\nnumber,” “Date,” “Status,” and “Notes” columns. Here is a snippet from the\nMarch part of the Jaunty plan.\n\nMarch 2009 |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---  \nWeek number |  Date |  Status |  Notes  \n18 |  March 5 |  User Interface Freeze Artwork Deadline Two |   \n19 |  March 12 |  |  Alpha 6  \n20 |  March 19 |  Beta Freeze Final Artwork Freeze |  Rebuild Test  \n21 |  March 26 |  Beta Release Docs String Freeze |  Beta  \n  \nAn important component that enables the planning cycle is knowing how long\neach task should take to complete. When you build your own cycle with your\ncommunity, make a fair assessment of how long your tasks should take, and\nbuild in some redundancy for delays.\n\nWhen your cycle is complete, you should ensure that it is published and\navailable to all your community members. An excellent way to do this is to\nplace it on a wiki.\n\n## The Gates of Your Community\n\nNow let’s take a look at another item on our TODO list.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Attract a diverse range of contributors.\n\nAttracting new contributors is an essential part of any community. Earlier we\nused this item as an example in fleshing out a description of our process. I\nwant to now explore this important item in more detail.\n\nIn attracting contributors, our goal is not merely to get the word out; it is\nabout getting the word out to the _right people_ and ensuring that they can\njoin us in achieving our goals.\n\nIn this work we have two primary outcomes that we want to achieve:\n\n  * To ensure that the on-ramp from consumer of buzz to full-fledged community member is as smooth as possible\n\n  * To attract community members who will demonstrate commitment and a willingness to work toward the goals of the community\n\nThe first point may seem obvious, but the second is subtler. What we want to\navoid are drive-by contributors. These are people who join a community for a\nfew weeks, you help them get up and running, and they then get bored and move\non.\n\nDrive-by contributors are expensive, not necessarily financially, but in terms\nof time. Contributors often require a certain level of (wo)manpower. The\ncommunity responds to their questions and provides the help, guidance,\ntraining, and mentorship needed to get them on their feet. If these\ncontributors receive this assistance and fail to deliver anything of value,\nthey become expensive propositions.\n\nAnimal welfare communities have dealt with this for years. Cristina Verduzco\nis the volunteer/outreach manager for the [East Bay and Tri-Valley\nSPCA](http://www.eastbayspca.org/). Cristina is responsible for recruiting,\ntraining, and managing volunteers. She is responsible for all facets of the\nvolunteer program, coordination and planning of multiple events, and\ncoordination of mobile adoptions.\n\nRetention is important for animal welfare communities. Not only do volunteers\nneed to be trained in how to care for the animals, but they also develop bonds\nwith the animals they care for. It is in the interest of the animals to\nmaintain sustained contributions: they feel more comfortable around familiar\nfaces. Cristina told me she is fully aware of the biggest risk to retention:\n\n> Retaining volunteers will always be a problem for any animal welfare\n> organization. While the work is rewarding, it can also be difficult. We are\n> fortunate that our euthanasia rates are lower than almost all other\n> shelters, as we don’t euthanize animals for lack of space. While it is\n> common that issues around euthanasia tend to be a big reason for people not\n> to return, we don’t see that quite as often at our shelter.\n\nEvery community is strained by push and pull forces that will affect your\nability to retain volunteers. This will apply equally in your community. For\nthe SPCA, euthanasia is clearly a blocker for many to get involved. What is\nyour equivalent blocker? This could be difficult personalities, suboptimal\nworking conditions, hugely complex processes and technical procedures, or\nanything else.\n\nYou should identify these blockers and ensure that you have resources to help\npeople over the hump. Importantly, you should not downplay or cover up the\ndifficulties in your community, but until you can fix the problems (which you\nshould seek to do as a matter of priority), it is entirely reasonable to make\nthose difficulties as pleasant to navigate as possible.\n\nYou should also focus on the attracting forces that bring people to your\ncommunity while again ensuring that you communicate a balanced perspective. At\nthe SPCA, the clear attracting force was kittens and puppies, but Cristina is\nkeen to balance this with the reality:\n\n> Let’s face it—playing with kittens and puppies sounds fun until you realize\n> there’s cleaning and training involved, and sometimes that deters\n> volunteers. Sometimes people have every intention to commit, and down the\n> line realize their schedules don’t work out.\n\nThese long-term contributors are the real rock stars in your community.\nCristina and her colleagues rely on their “angels” heavily:\n\n> Fortunately, there are always those people who come in, fall in love with\n> the work, and stay for the long haul. Some of our volunteers have been with\n> us over ten years, and they come every week without fail. We refer to them\n> as our “angels”. Our volunteers are the reason shelter animals don’t go\n> crazy in confinement, and for that reason we are indebted to them.\n\nYou have an enormous opportunity to find your own “angels” if you offer enough\nenthusiasm and excitement to pique interest in your community, give them a\nrealistic set of expectations about the work involved, and ensure that their\nexperience is positive.\n\nBefore we move on, I want to be entirely clear when I say “long-term\ncontributors” here. You should not expect your contributors to be working\nfull-time for your community. Your focus should be on sustained contributions,\nno matter how long each contribution lasts. If your contributors put in three\nhours a week every week, that is an excellent gift to your community. This\ngift is also far better than two days of frenetic full-time contribution and\nthen nothing else.\n\nRetaining contributors sounds complex, but is thankfully pretty simple. If you\nwant people to stick around, you need to offer them _a regular sense of\nachievement_. Your community members need to feel (a) that they are\nproductive, (b) that their contributions are appreciated, and (c) that (a) and\n(b) happen repeatedly.\n\nThis is particularly important for new contributors. When someone first\nexpresses interest in joining your community, she needs to follow what I call\nthe _contributor ramp_ :\n\n  * Identify an area in which she can contribute\n\n  * Learn the skills required to contribute\n\n  * Know which specific task to work on\n\n  * Know how to submit her work\n\nWhen you start attracting people to your community, you are encouraging them\nto begin interfacing with this process. As such, you need to make sure you\nhave all of the above in order before you even make a peep. The most logical\nhome for this information is your website.\n\n## Assessing Contributors\n\nMany collaborative projects embody some kind of access control. In a typical\nopen source project, those who can contribute code are restricted, and\ndevelopers are assigned a username and password to contribute code to the\nrepository. The reason is simple: you don’t want just anyone changing the\nproject. The integrity of the code base is essential. You always want your\ncode to run, be as error-free as possible, and maintain consistent coding\nguidelines. If access were entirely open, those with malicious intentions or\nerror-prone (in)abilities could introduce bugs, defects, and security flaws to\nyour project. Having a vetting process is important to ensure that your\ndevelopers can be trusted and will demonstrate this level of quality.\n\nAs we briefly discussed earlier in this chapter, it is important for us to\nfigure out how new potential developers can gain access to the project. If I\nwant to contribute to an open source project and am unknown, how do I prove my\nabilities?\n\nThe first task is to assess what your expectations of quality are. For many\nopen source projects, they are relatively simple:\n\n  * A reasonable knowledge of programming; the contributor should not be making the obvious mistakes that new developers make.\n\n  * A familiarity with the code base and coding conventions.\n\n  * A regularity of contribution.\n\nAlthough the implementation of these expectations involves infrastructure\ntechnology (bug trackers, source control systems, etc.), which we defer\ndiscussion of until later in this book, we can take a high-level view of how\nsome of these processes work.\n\nThe Elevator Pitch\n\nBefore we continue, again remember that simplicity is key to good processes.\nOne of the most effective methods of determining whether your processes are\nreally as simple as you think they are is the “elevator pitch.” This is easy\nto test.\n\nImagine you are out having a drink with some friends and talking about your\ncommunity. One of them asks how he can get involved. To pass the test, you\nshould be able to recite your process and have him understand it within a\nminute.\n\nIf the person you are speaking to stumbles on any part of the process or needs\nit reexplained, your process needs some work.\n\n### Reviewing new developers: In depth\n\nAd Hoc Peer Review is common in the open source world. Here is how it works:\nyou have an existing member of the community review a new contributor’s\nproposed contribution, and if it is acceptable, the existing member will\ncommit it on the new contributor’s behalf.\n\nAs an example, imagine Adam would like to fix a bug in the OpenOffice.org\nproject. He grabs the code, programs a solution to the bug, and then sends an\nexisting OpenOffice.org developer the fix. That developer (let’s call him\nMichael) then reviews the fix, and if it is suitable, he commits the fix to\nthe main OpenOffice.org code base.\n\nTypically this process would be repeated until each proposed contribution from\nAdam is almost certainly going to be accepted by Michael. At this point, Adam\nwould be given direct developer access to the source code repository.\n\nA range of projects use this approach. One such project is Jokosher, which was\nmentioned earlier in [Chapter 2](ch02.html \"Chapter 2. Planning Your\nCommunity\"). When the project first started, a new contributor called Laszlo\nPandy wanted to get involved. He joined the IRC chat channel to express his\ninterest and was asked to submit some patches (small bundles of code changes).\nTo make this as easy as possible for new contributors, we had written a web\npage that explained how this worked.\n\nI reviewed some of his patches. With each one, I provided him technical\nfeedback: areas that worked, elements that needed fixing, and so on. When\nLaszlo’s patches were of sufficient quality (which required only minor\nadjustments), I committed them for him. After three or four patches, every one\nwas excellent. At this point we gave him direct access to the Jokosher\nrepository. As a bonus piece of Jokosher trivia, Laszlo went on to become the\nleader of the Jokosher project.\n\nThere are a number of requirements for this process to work:\n\n  * You need to clearly explain in what form new contributors provide a contribution. Should this be a patch? An email? A document? Explain what is required.\n\n  * Where do new contributors send their contribution? Post it to a mailing list? Mention it on IRC? Email a specific person? Attach it to a bug report?\n\n  * Your community must be able to access these new contributions and have existing, experienced contributors provide feedback. It is important that this feedback is not held up due to having only a limited set of contributors who are able to provide it. Every contribution should be seen as a gift, and as such should rightly expect feedback, even if this feedback is just “This is excellent work, I have committed this.”\n\n  * There needs to be a method of tracking these recurring contributions. If a new contributor has contributed three or four excellent patches that have been committed with few or no changes, you need a means of identifying this recurring quality. This could be as informal as some core contributors keeping a mental note of the new contributions, or as formal as maintaining a written log of contributions.\n\nAlthough this approach has been described here within the context of providing\ncode contributions, this could equally apply to other types of contributions,\nsuch as documentation, art, and translations.\n\nFor nontechnical projects, a similar approach can involve simply reviewing\nprior work by the contributor. If you are organizing a local community event\nand you want a contributor to do the art for the brochure, you could ask him\nto produce some initial drafts, make sure they’re acceptable, and then accept\nthe contributor as the brochure artist.\n\nUnfortunately, for some larger communities (particularly large open source\nprojects), the previous approach is unsuitable. This can be due to a number of\nreasons:\n\n  * The technical requirements involved for the new contributor are too complex to be assessed in a loose and ad hoc way.\n\n  * There are too many new contributors submitting content for the existing developers to assess in a timely manner.\n\n  * The project is hugely popular, touching thousands or even millions of users, and as such, granted access needs to be more rigorously assessed.\n\nAlthough the core technique of reviewing proposed contributions does not\nchange with a more formalized approach (having people check a contribution\nbefore it is committed), what does change is how you track and review those\ncontributions.\n\nLet’s look at an example. In the Ubuntu community, we have a little more\nformality in how new contributors can gain access to one of our key\nrepositories, Universe. Our guiding policy has always been that new\ncontributors should demonstrate a _significant and sustained contribution_.\nThat is what we seek to assess in new contributors.\n\nThe Universe repository is a large collection of applications that are\npackaged by volunteers. These applications are not officially supported by the\nCanonical technical support service, and they don’t receive security updates.\nThe members who work on these packages are called MOTUs (short for Masters of\nthe Universe). The MOTU community is led by the MOTU Council, a small group of\nwell-respected MOTU contributors.\n\nAlthough more formalized, the process is still relatively simple:\n\n  1. New contributors make their contribution by attaching a patch to a bug report. They then subscribe the ubuntu-universe-sponsors team to the bug report. The collection of bugs subscribed to that team is called the Sponsorship Queue.\n\n  2. The team looks at each patch, reviews them, offers feedback, and, where suitable, uploads the changes.\n\n  3. This process repeats a number of times to demonstrate the sustainability of contributions from a given contributor.\n\n  4. After a number of contributions have been made, an existing MOTU will often recommend that the contributor apply for MOTU approval.\n\n  5. Candidates prepare a wiki page outlining the contributions they have made to the project and also some endorsement statements from existing MOTUs to approve their application.\n\n  6. The application is reviewed by the MOTU Council and then approved where appropriate.\n\nThe MOTU community’s approach has been refined over the years. At its heart,\nnew contributors add their contribution to a queue, go through review, and\nthen apply to the MOTU Council. The only differences are the sponsorship queue\nand the approval process, which make the approach more formalized.\n\n## Managing Feedback\n\nGathering feedback from the outside world is an often-overlooked but important\nfacet of a strong and healthy community. Feedback is important for providing\nyou with others’ perspectives, and these perspectives can help identify\nopportunities, problems, and areas that need renewed focus. It is this\nfeedback that tells you what people outside your community think of your\ngoals, ambitions, and progress. As such, feedback is a positive double-edged\nsword: not only does it provide pleasant confirmation of things we’re doing\nright, but it also reveals and focuses our minds on areas to improve. Finally,\na good process for handling feedback can improve all your other processes, as\nI explained earlier in this chapter.\n\nUnfortunately, many community leaders view feedback as a nuisance, and\ndisregard it if it challenges their work and the norms of the community. This\nis the wrong perspective to take. Feedback instead offers us an incredible\nopportunity to improve how our community functions.\n\nNone of us is perfect. None of us gets things right every time. Even the\ngreatest community leaders in the world—and the most intelligent and hard-\nworking community members—get it wrong sometimes. But being wrong is not black\nand white. In many cases we craft interesting and inspiring initiatives, but\nwe sometimes focus on the wrong things or overcomplicate matters. Feedback\nhelps zone our minds in on which elements to fix.\n\nThis happened to me a few years ago. Back in February 2008, my team and I were\nthinking of methods to improve how we handle our list of bugs in Ubuntu. As\nUbuntu has grown and is now used on millions of computers around the world,\nthe list of reported bugs has grown, too.\n\nAfter fleshing out a number of different possible approaches and plans, we\nannounced a new scheme called 5-A-Day. The idea was inspired by the popular\nmeme of eating five portions of fruit or vegetables every day to stay healthy.\nI wanted to apply this concept to software bugs: encouraging everyone in the\nUbuntu community to work on five bugs every day. This would make our bug list,\nand resultantly Ubuntu, healthier, too.\n\nThe response was stunning. Many contributors got involved, and thousands of\nbugs received attention. Many of our contributors didn’t stop at five bugs,\nthough; they were often nailing upward of 20 or 30 a day. Some were even\nhitting 100 a day. These people were bug-squashing machines.\n\nTen months later, at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in California, I scheduled a\nsession to review 5-A-Day. I was keen to gather feedback and opinions about\nthe initiative and how we could improve it. In the session, a friend of mine\ncalled Robert Collins raised a valid point: in measuring 5-A-Day, we were\nmeasuring the wrong things.\n\nRobert argued that 5-A-Day should not be recognizing those who were smashing\npast the five-bug target for each day and hitting the high bug numbers. He\nfelt that in keeping with the Ubuntu ethos of _significant and sustained\ncontributions_ , 5-A-Day should instead cap the number of bugs at five per day\nand track _how long_ people were maintaining their daily 5-A-Day. Robert felt\nthat it was more valuable if we knew that a contributor had consistently\nworked on five bugs a day for a month, instead of doing 155 bugs in a day. He\nwas right. Sustainability is an essential component in community: more bugs\nget fixed, people consistently set a good example for others, and we build a\nlong-term contributor base that is regularly working on bugs as opposed to\nlocalized spikes of interest.\n\nIn this example, our request for feedback at the Ubuntu Developer Summit\nresulted in a valuable piece of insight, one that may never have occurred to\nmy immediate colleagues or to me.\n\n### Gathering feedback\n\nFeedback can be collected in many ways. The simplest and often most effective\nway is to set up an email address that forwards email to a number of core\ncommunity members. A simplification of this approach is to set up an account\nwith a free email service and give each of your core members access to the\naccount. This approach is excellent for gathering general thoughts, concerns,\nand opinions about the community that often reflect on processes.\n\nAnother alternative is to set up a public mailing list that people can submit\nfeedback to. This solution is not the most suitable for single-shot chunks of\nfeedback from someone. Mailing lists are designed for discussion, so you\nshould really use mailing lists only if you want people to submit feedback and\nhave a discussion afterward. Another downside of mailing lists is that they\nrequire people to sign up, and these members will also receive all email to\nthe list. Someone who just wants to give you a quick chunk of feedback likely\nwon’t want to see what everyone else is submitting to the list.\n\nAnother possibility is to use a blog. You could post entries to the blog to\nrequest feedback and allow readers to provide their feedback in the comments.\nRemember that all feedback here will be public. You may not want to have\neveryone and her dog see this feedback (although it is an impressive message\nof transparency if you do). What’s more, remember that search engines will\nindex this potentially negative feedback, showing it to everyone who searches\non your project name, even if you’ve since addressed the problems.\n\nThe most productive approaches I’ve used for gathering feedback have been\nsurveys and one-on-one discussions. We cover surveys in more detail in\n[Chapter 8](ch08.html \"Chapter 8. Measuring Community\"); they are an excellent\nmeans of gathering focused feedback around specific areas of interest. I have\nused them extensively in my work, particularly online surveys, and they have\nalways gathered excellent results.\n\nWhichever of these techniques you decide to use, you should always augment\nthem with some direct one-on-one discussions. Find people who have an opinion\nabout the process you are investigating, and get them on the phone, send them\nsome specific questions through email, or get together to discuss their views\nover a coffee. This direct feedback is often very valuable; just remember that\nfeedback will always be tinged with opinion and potential exaggeration, and\none-on-one discussions are the most likely candidate for this.\n\nPutting Criticism in Context\n\nOne final note about feedback is related to expectations. You should prepare\nyourself to receive more criticism than praise. This is simply the nature of\ncommunity and human interaction: we often feel compelled to write an email to\ncriticize, but we rarely get an urge to send an email to praise. As such, if\nyou receive what appears to be a large amount of criticism, it may not be\nreflective of your community. It is likely that there are a lot of silent yet\nhappy members out there.\n\n# Getting Buy-In for Your Processes\n\nSo far we have discussed many of the best practices for building simple yet\neffective processes. We have talked about simplicity, transparency, avoiding\nbureaucracy, assessing needs, and more. Processes don’t mean anything, though,\nunless your community (a) knows about them, (b) understands them, and (c) uses\nthem.\n\nAt the beginning of this chapter, we likened processes to machines and waxed\nlyrical about how interface design and industrial design have made devices\neasier to implement. We noted that we should apply the same logic to our\nprocesses. We can continue our analogy beyond the development of processes\n(akin to the devices) and also apply it to their packaging and distribution.\nHow can we make our processes as easy to understand, discover, and use as\npossible?\n\n## Document Them\n\nThe first step in making a process work for your community is to ensure that\nit is documented. The goal here is efficiency. Sure, anyone can write a\ndetailed list of steps outlining how a process works, but who wants to read\nparagraphs and paragraphs of text? The documentation behind a process should\nbe as close as possible to a cooking recipe: do this…do that…get this result.\nThe emphasis here is on quick, clear, straight-to-the-point directions.\n\nProcesses are fundamentally a collection of steps with an outcome. Documenting\nthem is similar to Ikea’s instructions for putting together a shelving unit.\nHow can you tell the user how to achieve the outcome as easily and effectively\nas possible?\n\nWhen Ikea does this, it uses only pictures, presumably to avoid translating\ninstructions into multiple languages. Although I would recommend using text\nfor most communities’ processes, the Ikea model is cathartic and helps focus\nyour mind on the right goal of reducing clutter.\n\nTo get you started, let’s get introspective for a while and document your own\nsteps for writing a process:\n\n  1. First, write down the end goal of your process. What does it achieve?\n\n  2. Now, in numerical and chronological order, write down each step in your process, using a single word to describe each step.\n\n  3. Finally, for each word, write a single sentence that clearly explains what is involved in the step.\n\nAs an example, the following could be used to develop a process for a new\ndeveloper contributing a patch to a project:\n\nGOAL: Achieving contributor access in the FooBar project.  \n---  \nPRODUCE: Produce a patch with a new feature or bug fix that can apply to the\nlatest development version of the code.  \nSUBMIT: Send the patch to the FooBar project mailing list outlining what it\ndoes.  \nWAIT: Wait for feedback on the patch and, if required, make adjustments.\nOtherwise, the patch will be submitted.  \nREPEAT: Repeat the above steps until a developer considers your contributions\nconsistent enough to offer you direct access to the repository.  \n  \nWhen following through with this approach, always read and reread each step,\nand assess how easy it is to understand. Is it written concisely? Does it use\ntoo much jargon? Would it be suitable as an elevator pitch?\n\n## Make Them Easy to Find\n\nProcesses don’t have any value when no one knows that they exist. In addition\nto ensuring that your processes are clearly written, you should work hard to\nensure that they are discoverable. Our goal here is to ensure that community\nmembers can find our documented processes easily.\n\nThis is a two-step approach:\n\n  1. You need to put your documentation somewhere online that people can refer to.\n\n  2. You need to inform your community about additions and changes to the documentation when they happen.\n\nThe first step involves putting your process somewhere accessible. If it makes\nsense, you should put it with the rest of the strategic documentation that we\ndiscussed earlier in the book. Discoverability is the key here, though.\n\nAs an example, if you have a process that new contributors should use to gain\nrepository access, you should make sure new contributors can find it. This\nkind of documentation should not be buried in a wiki somewhere. You should\nassess where your potential contributors are reading documentation and where\nthey are likely to look to find your processes. Again, plenty of feedback can\nensure that you make the best decision here.\n\nLinking Forever\n\nWhen putting process documentation online, you should ensure that its location\nnever changes. The link to the location will be referenced extensively,\nparticularly in online communities.\n\nIf you need to move your documentation, you should ensure that the old link\nredirects to the new documentation. The referenceable integrity of your\ndocumentation is something you should always endeavor to maintain, even if\nyour documentation moves.\n\nThe next step is to announce the new process documentation to your community.\nEarlier in this book, we discussed communication channels within your\ncommunity, and you should use these channels to announce this documentation\nand encourage your community to make use of it.\n\nWhen you announce your processes, you should include the following details:\n\n  * The problem you sought to solve\n\n  * A single paragraph overview of the process and how it works\n\n  * A link to the online documentation that explains how the process works\n\n  * A final paragraph that strongly encourages the community to make use of the process\n\nWhen announcing new processes, you should tread carefully. You should expect\nthat your members, suffering from the same fear of rigidity and rules I\nmentioned at the beginning of this chapter, will roll their eyes at the\nconcept of a new process being announced. Your goal is to have them entirely\non board by the end of the announcement. Use loose and friendly language, and\nmake them understand that the process is really necessary and not merely an\nexercise in bureaucracy.\n\n## Using Your Processes\n\nWith the process documented and announced, the final step is to encourage your\ncommunity to make use of it. Documentation and announcements are no guarantee\nyour community will make use of a process. In my experience, every process\nneeds a certain amount of manual pushing and poking to become the norm.\n\nCommunities generally follow by example: members look toward other people to\nengage with processes before they do it themselves. You need to put a few\nexamples of successful use of each process in place as a head start to get the\ncommunity to accept the processes.\n\nA useful approach is to pick four or five key community members and ensure\nthat they are fully behind the process you have announced. You should\nregularly check in with these members to ensure that they are making use of\nthe process, and when they are not, you should check why and remind them where\nneeded. You should also encourage these key members to spread their best\npractices throughout the community.\n\nYou should also identify incidents that act as opportunities to reaffirm the\npurpose of the process. This could be handled in two ways. On the one hand,\nyou should find success stories: examples that used the process with very\npositive results. These examples are always fantastic to show off. On the\nother hand, when someone doesn’t follow the process and things go wrong, you\ncan use it as a chance to remind your community about the purpose of the\nprocess. Do tread this line with caution: you should absolutely _not_ show up\nyour community members in front of others, and you should try not to climb up\non your high horse and send out an “I told you so!” message.\n\n# The On-Ramp: Creating Collaborative Processes\n\nThroughout this chapter we have discussed how to build great processes that\nare focused on accomplishing things effectively and reducing the level of\nbureaucracy involved in the community (screw you, bureaucracy). These\nprocesses can be applied to anything that involves any kind of structure or\ndeliverable outcome, but I want to spend a little time focusing on a very\nspecific family of processes that you will want to get right: the _on-ramp_.\n\nThe on-ramp is the set of steps and processes that are involved in helping\nsomeone to get up and running participating in your community. While the term\n_on-ramp_ has been used for some time, there is little consistency or best\npractice when it comes to what actually constitutes an on-ramp.\n\nOver the years I have developed my own approach to the on-ramp and a set of\nsteps and processes that not only help people to participate, but to also gain\nthe skills they need and to feel accomplished and celebrated in their\ncontributions. As I have developed this standard approach I have applied it to\na range of different communities with good results.\n\nI define the on-ramp as shown in [Figure 4-1](ch04.html#the_onramp_diagram\n\"Figure 4-1. An on-ramp is a useful means of defining the different milestones\nin how a community member learns how to participate in your community.\").\n\n![An on-ramp is a useful means of defining the different milestones in how a\ncommunity member learns how to participate in your\ncommunity.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159253.png)\n\nFigure 4-1. An on-ramp is a useful means of defining the different milestones\nin how a community member learns how to participate in your community.\n\nIn my on-ramp there are four steps, each of which is important in the\ncommunity member collaboration experience. They can be summarized as follows:\n\nIdentifying the on-ramp\n\n    \n\nFor a community member to be able to participate, he needs to know he _can_\nparticipate. We need to be able to reach out and make it clear that\ncollaboration and contributions are not only possible, but also actively\nencouraged.\n\nDeveloping knowledge\n\n    \n\nWith any kind of collaboration a set of skills and knowledge is required in\norder for people to take part. As an example, if you want to write\ndocumentation, you need to know how to write the documentation, how the tools\nwork, and how to contribute your work to the community. We want to make this\nskills acquisition process as simple as possible.\n\nDetermining contributions\n\n    \n\nWhen you know you can participate and have the knowledge to do so, you then\nneed to know what to work on. Which areas need participation and\ncontributions? Which problems need fixing? We want to have a solid set of\nthings that people can pick up and do.\n\nGrowing kudos\n\n    \n\nFinally, when a community member has contributed something to the community,\nyou want to ensure that he feels a sense of appreciation (what I call _kudos_)\nfor his contribution.\n\nThese four steps in the on-ramp not only cover the timeline of the contributor\nexperience (learning that you can participate, gaining the knowledge to do so,\nknowing what to work on, and having your contribution celebrated), but also\ntend to happen chronologically in that order…hence the premise of it being a\nramp.\n\nJust having knowledge of these four steps in the contributor process is useful\nin itself to be able to identify the kind of processes you need to put in\nplace to serve the collaborative experience well. I want to build on these\nsteps and take a quick spin through each of them to give you some examples of\nthe processes I have put in place in the communities I have worked with.\n\n## Identifying the On-Ramp\n\nIt doesn’t matter how great your processes are farther up the on-ramp; if\npeople don’t know they can take part in your community, they will never get\ninvolved.\n\nAlthough this sounds obvious, it is easy to forget this important first\ncomponent of the on-ramp when we are so busy and knee-deep in building\nprocesses, tracking their effectiveness, and dealing with problems and other\nwork.\n\nPart of the challenge here are the different levels of abstraction in your\ncommunity. As an example, in the Ubuntu community we have many different\nteams: documentation writers, translators, packagers, bug triagers, and more.\nAt a team level we have generally had the bases covered here; each team would\nhave a website which made it clear that everyone is welcome to participate in\nher respective team. We went to great lengths to ensure that all the major\nteams had these pages in place and that new folks who would express an\ninterest in a team would know their participation is desired and encouraged.\n\nWhile this served us well at the team level, it was also important for us to\ndo this at the higher general community level for people who were literally\nbrand-new to Ubuntu and had no idea how the community works. In these cases\npeople had typically tried Ubuntu and were curious about it, and we needed to\ninform them about how Ubuntu is a collaborative community and anyone can\nparticipate. This work was best done by highlighting the many different types\nof contributions and how these contributions typically map to teams, which\nthen connects the prospective contributor to the team’s on-ramping process.\n\nTo do this we created a web page that highlighted these different types of\ncontributions and then handed people off to different teams where a team\nmember could continue the on-ramping of that person. We found this worked\npretty effectively, but the high-level web page needed a lot of user testing,\nfeedback, and changes to serve these needs well. We discovered that in\ncreating this page we naturally presumed some knowledge that prospective\nmembers actually didn’t have; the user testing helped us to weed out these\npresumptions and bring more clarity.\n\nWe performed this user testing by putting together a page and asking a range\nof different types of users with different levels of experience to provide\nfeedback on the page. We then reviewed the feedback, applied some changes to\nthe page, and went through another round of user testing. This was hugely\nvaluable in identifying the assumptions and errors in the page.\n\n## Developing Knowledge\n\nSkills acquisition is a critical piece in encouraging successful participation\nin community. If we want people to contribute to our community, they need to\nhave the appropriate skills to be able to deliver good work.\n\nSkills acquisition involves two broad challenges:\n\n  * How do we provide all the facilities required to help new community members learn what they need to contribute?\n\n  * How do we help give them the confidence to participate?\n\nThe former is the big, obvious challenge. Fortunately in the current age of\nthe (mostly) ubiquitous Internet, self-learning is common. Most Internet users\nhave used various websites and facilities and learned how to do something, be\nit using web email, using a piece of technology, or something else. The\nInternet is awash with varying quality levels of help and guidance for almost\nanything, and people around the world are used to performing research and\nself-teaching. As such, we want to try to produce processes and resources for\nlearning these skills in our communities.\n\nIt is important to remember, though, that skills acquisition is not just about\nproducing tutorials and documentation and putting them online. While this\ndocumentation does help, the pure availability of it does not necessarily mean\npeople will read it. Also, when people read it they will likely have\nquestions, problems and issues with their learning, and other areas in which\nthey need help and guidance. As such, when building your solution here you\nwant to strive to produce (a) core knowledge transfer material (e.g.,\ndocumentation), (b) methods of encouraging the consumption of that material,\nand (c) support facilities to provide help and guidance.\n\nIn the Ubuntu community we served these kinds of needs in a few different\nways. First we encouraged the community to document help and guidance that\ncould be useful to others. This included the creation of a knowledge base of\ncontent and an actively communicated ethos that the knowledge base should be\nadded to and extended when someone noticed that a key piece of information or\nguidance was missing. This would result in a growing resource of help and\nguidance.\n\nWe augmented this work with a set of Ubuntu training weeks. These events would\nproduce a week-long set of tutorial sessions, many of which referenced this\npreexisting documentation, but these sessions also actively focused on\nteaching a particular skill or approach in the community (e.g., how to create\ndocumentation, how to fix a bug, etc.).\n\nFinally, we provided a number of resources for getting help and guidance. This\nincludes a web-based question and answer service, real-time IRC discussion\nchannels, mailing lists, and more. This collection of resources would help\nprovide all the necessary steps for prospective community members to up-skill\nthemselves to contribute effectively.\n\nIn our two broad challenges earlier, I also highlighted the challenge of _how\ndo we help give them the confidence to participate?_\n\nThis challenge is less about providing documentation resources and more about\ngiving people the motivational support and encouragement that they really\n_can_ learn the skills and contribute great things to the community. In many\ncases new prospective community members feel a little nervous and self-\nconscious about whether they can contribute, often because they see so many\nother smart and active contributors and feel unsure about whether they can\nmatch their abilities.\n\nYou should make a point of breaking down this self-doubt and replacing it with\nconfidence and support from the community to help grow confidence in\ncontributing. Achieving this usually involves plenty of positive messaging,\npositive reenforcement, and one-on-one encouragement.\n\n## Determining Contributions\n\nWhile in most communities the previous two steps on the on-ramp get plenty of\nfocus, the determining contributions component often gets less attention.\n\nPart of the reason for this is that making people aware of the on-ramp and\nhelping people to up-skill themselves is often a largely single-shot chunk of\nwork that, when completed, we can forget about. The challenge of giving people\nsomething to work on requires more attention to detail as the tasks that need\nto be completed at any given time change from day to day.\n\nThe other challenge here is that different community members with different\nlevels of experience are better suited to different types of work. As an\nexample, an experienced programmer can dig into a code base and get started\nright away. On the other hand, someone who is very new to a project and\nprogramming language will need something much simpler to get started with. Now\nfold into the mix the many different types of contributions in a community\n(e.g., advocacy, documentation, translations) and it can be difficult to\nsegment available tasks in ways that are best suited for different community\nmembers with different skills and competence levels.\n\nThe simple reality here is that for anything other than a small community, you\nwon’t have the time to have an overview of all open tasks to be completed and\nensure that they are assigned to people with a suitable expertise and skill\nlevel. What we instead need to focus our efforts on is ensuring that _new\nstarters_ can find something to do, and importantly, that they can feel a\n_sense of accomplishment_.\n\nThe sense of accomplishment of contributing something of value to the\ncommunity is the secret recipe for success here. If a new community member can\njoin a community, and have a small task to do that is performed and then\naccepted by the community, it provides a real sense of euphoria. We want to\nprovide opportunities for these new members who can go from zero to hero and\ndo something that is valued by the community.\n\nSome years ago I trialled an approach in the Ubuntu community that has served\nus well in this regard. The idea was simple: identify a set of bug reports\nthat don’t require extensive knowledge to fix and can be fixed within an hour,\nand put these bug reports in a _bite-size_ category. We would then offer these\nbite-size bug reports to new members of the community who would be able to fix\nthem within their skill level and thus feel a strong sense of accomplishment\nwhen they got accepted shortly afterward. This sense of accomplishment would\nfuel an energy and enthusiasm to fix another bug report, and build a\nsturdiness to learning more complex skills and contributing to more complex\ntasks.\n\nTo help disseminate these bite-size bugs I asked each member of my team to\nwrite weekly blog posts highlighting bugs that need to be resolved, and\ninviting prospective community members to take a look at these bugs. In each\nof these blog entries there would also be links to our up-skilling resources,\nsupport channels, and more. As such, these blog entries would provide a set of\nsimple issues that need fixing, thank people who fixed the issues from the\nprevious week (which grows the kudos part of the on-ramp), and also highlight\na standard set of resources that can be used to learn the skills to fix those\nissues. We found these weekly posts to be successful in driving more\nparticipation in different teams.\n\n## Growing Kudos\n\nWhen you get to this final component on the on-ramp, your community members\nhave already committed extensively to your community; they have been inspired\nto participate, learned the skills they need, and contributed to a task that\nneeded completing. In any typical case of one human being helping another with\nsomething, we say _thanks_ ; you should find ways to do the same thing in your\ncommunity.\n\nIn small communities this is less of a problem: it is easy to see a\ncontribution and thank the person who performed it. In bigger communities this\ncan be more challenging; when there are hundreds or thousands of things going\non every week or month it is impractical to be able to say thanks for\neverything. This is an important challenge to scale, though; validation is a\nkey piece in helping to maintain a sense of belonging and appreciation for\nyour community members.\n\nI have traditionally focused on encouraging an _appreciation culture_ in two\ncore forms:\n\nBroadcast appreciation\n\n    \n\nBroadcasting out to the wider community appreciation for work and\naccomplishments made by particular teams or people\n\nContextual appreciation\n\n    \n\nSaying thanks for work and accomplishments to the people who did them at a\none-to-one level\n\nBoth of these approaches are important within collaborative communities. From\nthe perspective of the community member being thanked, the broadcast approach\nis nice to see as you feel a sense of appreciation disseminated across the\nwider community; the wider community see that you did a great job. The\ncontextual approach is nice to see to provide a general sense of appreciation\nin your day-to-day activities; you do something and someone says thanks and it\nmakes the community feel positive and fun.\n\nFor the _broadcast appreciation_ approach you should encourage your community\nto write blog entries and articles that highlight great work and thank people.\nThis is particularly important for community leaders to do. Communities are\nsocial groupings and inspirational leaders thanking and highlighting great\nwork is incredibly motivating.\n\nIn Ubuntu we have tackled this approach by encouraging a culture of thankful\nblogging and I have worked with our community leaders to encourage them to do\nthis. In many cases this would involve me reaching out to a leader and asking\nthis person to blog. In most cases the leader was happy to do this and the\nrecipient of the kudos felt great when seeing it.\n\nFor the _contextual appreciation_ approach this is more of a cultural norm\nthat you want to build; you want to grow a culture in which it is normal to\nsay thanks when someone does something for or contributes to the community. In\nUbuntu we have approached this by regularly reminding people of and\nencouraging this behavior and highlighting the positivity it generates. We\ntend to repeat this message at every Ubuntu Developer Summit to keep it fresh.\n\nWhen the Ramp is too Steep\n\nSometimes, despite your best efforts, the on-ramp that you build for your\ncommunity will perplex and challenge people in ways you don’t expect. Some\npeople will misunderstand components of how they get involved and likely will\nstep on some toes in the process.\n\nThis can be frustrating, but hang in there. If the person is taking her time\nto bungle her way through your on-ramp, she is likely worth the investment of\ntime to help her make the right steps instead of fat-footing it. This will\nrequire some patience and mentorship, and it is recommended that you have some\ncommunity members who you can rely on to help provide this support.\n\nWhen providing this guidance always try to find a means of tracking and\nassessing the person’s progress. This could mean observing her contributions,\ngetting feedback from others, having regular calls, or something else. This\nwill help you ensure that the progress is on track, and if the person is\ngenuinely not able to contribute, you can start scaling the guidance back at\nthe right point.\n\n# Process Reassessment\n\nProcesses are living, breathing organisms. They are typically based on current\nconditions: the current level of contribution, demand, expectations, and\ngoals. They are the clear plastic film that wraps around the assets and\nmembers of your community. As the assets and members adjust, so should the\nprocesses.\n\nAt the start of this chapter, we firmly established that unchanging processes\ncause bureaucracy. Processes that no longer map effectively to the people who\nneed to use them cause bureaucracy. Our whirlwind tour of process best\npractices would not be complete if we didn’t discuss how we can best evaluate\nour processes and make changes where appropriate, thus avoiding the dreaded\nclaw of bureaucracy.\n\nProcess reassessment has become a staple part of each Ubuntu release. The\nUbuntu community has a huge range of processes, initiatives, governance\nstructures, and more. Each of these facilities was developed to serve a\nspecific purpose, but as the community has grown and changed, these purposes\nand processes have needed to change, too.\n\nAn example of this was a change in how Ubuntu members have traditionally been\napproved. Anyone can be a member under the premise that he has demonstrated a\nsignificant and sustained contribution to open source. Traditionally, the way\nthis assessment was made was that the candidate would first produce a wiki\npage outlining these contributions. The next step would be to attend a\nCommunity Council meeting online in which the council would discuss the\napplication and vote. A majority vote would approve the member.\n\nAs the Ubuntu community continued to grow, this process became increasingly\noverstretched. The vast majority of Community Council meetings were devoted to\napproving members, and meetings were dragging on for nearly three hours. At an\nUbuntu Developer Summit we identified the problem and proposed that we set up\na series of regional subcouncils. We planned to set up a council in the\nAmericas, Europe, and Australasia, and these would take over the task of\napproving members.\n\nThe new councils were formed, and subsequent membership applications have been\nuniformly more efficient. This not only has benefited prospective members, but\nalso has meant that Community Council meetings have been more focused on\ngovernance issues than merely approving members.\n\nThese kinds of process reviews used to occur on an ad hoc basis in the Ubuntu\nworld, but we have since tied them to a regular timeline. We now reassess all\nprocesses at the beginning of a cycle, and many of these reassessments occur\nat our biannual Ubuntu Developer Summit. This provides an excellent\nopportunity to gather feedback (of which we identified the importance earlier\nin this chapter) and discuss better alternatives.\n\n### Note\n\nThe problem of overwork and delegating that work to other bodies in your\ncommunity is part of governance, and we discuss this in detail in [Chapter\n10](ch10.html \"Chapter 10. Governance\").\n\n## Building Regularity\n\nWith your community, you should schedule regular process reassessments. You\nshould schedule a time in which your community can come together to determine\nhow to improve on these underlying structures and processes.\n\nHow you do this is really dependent on your community. For a small local\ncommunity, why not organize a series of meetings in a coffee shop or at\nsomeone’s house? For an online community, a series of scheduled sessions on an\nonline chat network such as IRC is often effective. Alternatively, you could\norganize a more formalized event for your community, akin to what we do with\nour Ubuntu Developer Summit.\n\nHowever you choose to organize this reassessment, you should ensure the\nfollowing:\n\n  * The events should be accessible to your community members. They should preferably incur as little cost as possible, and be within reasonable reach. Organizing a reassessment in Jamaica when your community is based in Northern England is not practical.\n\n  * The events should be open to all of your community members, and you should explicitly state this when promoting them. You should clearly communicate that everyone is welcome to join in and provide feedback about how to improve how the community runs.\n\n  * Ensure a sensible level of representation. Feedback sessions with 2 or 200 people are not valuable. Sessions with 10–30 people offer real opportunity to achieve some conclusions.\n\n  * Ensure that you begin organizing these sessions with plenty of notice, particularly for physical meetings.\n\nWhen advertising these sessions, you should make them as attractive and\npractical as possible for your members. Don’t describe the session as a\n“governance and process review,” but rather as “how to improve our community.”\nMake sure your announcement welcomes everyone, and ensure that it underlines\nhow everyone can have an impact. Here is an example:\n\nImproving Our FooBar Community  \n---  \n1st–3rd Sep 2009 – 5pm–7pm UTC – #foobar on Freenode IRC  \nEver since the beginning of the FooBar project, we have all worked hard to\nproduce a rock-solid implementation of Bar, and we have seen many new\ncontributors join our stunning community.  \nThis range of sessions is designed for us to come together, share experiences\nand feedback on our processes and methods of working in our community, and see\nhow we can make improvements that benefit everyone. Everyone’s participation\nis not only welcome, but encouraged!  \n  \nWhen you have scheduled these reassessment sessions, you can build an action\nplan of what to discuss and how you discuss it. In many of these sessions\nthere is a potential for the discussion to wander off on a tangent. It is\ntherefore important to have a firm idea of what to discuss and what the core\nissues are.\n\nI recommend following these steps to carve out a method of handling these\nsessions:\n\n  1. Make a list of all the processes that are involved in your community. This should cover topics such as how people get involved, how you work together, how teams work, and so on. I recommend you do this in an online document, such as a wiki page.\n\n  2. For each process, include bullet points outlining the feedback you have heard, both good and bad.\n\n  3. Look at the full list and reorganize it into what you consider priority order. This is most typically driven by which processes are causing bottlenecks and problems in your community.\n\n  4. Inform the wider community of the list and ask people to either edit the list directly (if they can, such as with a wiki) or submit feedback for you to add to the list. You should ask for feedback about the processes and which processes they consider the most important to discuss. Give them a deadline for feedback that is before the reassessment sessions. Merge this feedback into the document and reprioritize the list based on the consensus.\n\nThis list is your agenda for the meetings. When you get together with the\ncommunity, pick the top processes and discuss them in turn. Communicate the\ngood and bad feedback with the community, and focus the discussion on coming\nup with modifications to the processes that may be an improvement. Always keep\nthese discussions focused on achieving outcomes; they can quickly degenerate\ninto fruitless conversations.\n\nWhen you reach consensus on changes to these processes, you should ensure that\nthe changes are noted down in the session. These notes provide a TODO list of\nchanges to your process documentation. Remember that each time a process\nchanges, you should announce it to the wider community, just as you did with\nnew processes.\n\n# Moving On\n\nAt this point, we are making some real progress on our journey through\ncommunity. We have a strategy and a direction, and we have identified how to\nbuild strong processes for many aspects of our community. Now it is time for\nus to get the tools of collaboration in our community’s hands. We need to put\nthe foundations in the ground that our community can use to build great\nthings. It is time to talk infrastructure....\n\n\n# Chapter 5. Supporting Workflow with Tools and Data\n\n“We shall neither fail nor falter, we shall not weaken or tire…give us the\ntools and we will finish the job.”\n\n—Winston Churchill\n\nWhen I was 16, I knew I wanted to play with computers. To access this world of\nexploration, though, I needed a bundle of what I had precious little of:\n_money_. One option was to save, but like many 16-year-olds I was more likely\nto fly to the moon on a potato than save any lucre.\n\nIt wasn’t just hardware that was at the mercy of money; it was also the\nInternet. Back in those dim, distant days, dial-up Internet access in England\ncost 10 pence a minute. As a blossoming Net junkie, I had a (seemingly\nreasonable) proposal for my parents. For each minute of Internet access, I\nwould put the requisite 10 pence in a cardboard box next to the computer. At\nthe end of the month when the phone bill came in, the money in the box could\ncover my usage. Simple. Well, at the end of the month a bill for £190 arrived,\nand there was six quid in the box. The philosophy of “it’s easier to ask for\nforgiveness than permission” didn’t wash with my parents.\n\nOver in the US, things were different. Many parts of the country had flat-rate\nlocal access and established Internet access at universities. The growth of\nthese cheap networks made it easy for online communities to form. Early on,\nthese communities shared knowledge as text files, packed with ideas,\ntechniques, and recipes to make things. Each text file was shared freely, and\npeople could add new content, modifications, and changes. Eventually, it\nseemed like information covering every conceivable subject was available\nonline. I myself contributed, writing guitar lessons and putting them on my\nwebsite.\n\nThis global body of knowledge was in many ways the great grandfather of\nWikipedia. The Internet not only enabled the sharing of information, but also\nenabled the sharing of tools to create this content. A new era of\ncollaboration was bubbling to the surface. As that collaboration became more\nwidespread, however, new challenges arose. While the cost of computing and the\nInternet declined, coordinating people across the Internet proved more\ndifficult than just opening the doors.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> Lots of online communities can be very competitive, especially between\n> different fan sites and groups, and I wanted to try and have the spirit of\n> sharing be the overwhelming feeling. We tried to always be as inclusive as\n> possible, and work to make people feel like they were part of one big group\n> of friends.\n>\n> —James Spafford, on Collaboration\n\nRead the [full interview](ch14.html#jamesspafford \"James Spafford, Media\nMolecule\") in [Chapter 14](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case Book\").\n\n# Understanding Your Workflow\n\nTools are a means to an end. They are used to produce an item that is more\ninteresting than the raw materials and devices used to manipulate it. To\nselect the right tools for a job, we first need to understand what we are\ntrying to achieve. We need to know what our _workflow_ is.\n\nI am a firm believer that every brain is different. Each interprets the world\nin a slightly different way, and each defines our differences and\nindividuality. Take music as an example. For some, the purest definition of\nbeautiful music is blues, for some it is rock, and for some it is crushing\ndeath metal. Each style has the same instruments and core ingredients, but we\nall perceive those styles in very different ways.\n\nThe same happens, for example, with programming languages. My brain just works\nwith Python. When I started to learn Python, it felt natural. I was productive\nalmost immediately. Other languages, such as Perl, just confuse the heck out\nof me. No matter how much I try, the square Perl block just doesn’t fit into\nthe circular hole in my head. Programming languages are curious vessels of\nlogic and workflow. Each one has a set of semantics, rules, and procedures\nthat must be learned and executed with perfect precision for it to work. In\naddition to this, different programming languages have different technical\napproaches, cultures, and expectations. Each attribute must be learned and\nmastered for the programming language to be a useful tool in helping you to\ncreate something. The reason why Python works with my brain is because the\nworkflow and semantics of Python help me to be productive quickly.\n\nThese differences are everywhere, and become more important as people work\ntogether. It’s not just programming languages, though. We see differences in\nhow we keep TODO lists, how we manage email, and how we organize our important\ndocuments. Our methods of working and our organization styles vary. A\nsuccessful workflow requires understanding what you want to achieve and making\nthe steps in which you achieve it as simple as possible for as many people as\npossible.\n\nOne of the reasons why the Firefox browser has been so popular has been its\nextensibility. A large and growing collection of Firefox add-ons is available.\nThese small bundles of functionality, basically small pieces of software,\nintegrate tightly into the browser and can do anything from block ads to allow\nweb developers to dynamically adjust the layout of web pages. Traditionally,\ninstalling software has been possible using a variety of approaches:\ninstallers, package archives, compiling code, and more. The Firefox team made\nit as simple as selecting an add-on and clicking Install. Firefox takes care\nof the rest. Workflow and usability are close companions.\n\nAnother successful workflow example comes from [Bytemark\nHosting](http://www.bytemark.co.uk/). This small company provides virtual\nhosting machines that run Linux. If my machine was unresponsive for some\nreason, it offered a command-line-driven administration console that I could\nlog in to. That console let me restart the machine and gather diagnostic\ninformation. Although it might have seemed complex and technical to the\naverage Firefox user, the console was fast, efficient, and intuitive for most\nLinux users. If a machine was down, I could be into the console within minutes\nand have it back up again, all from my familiar command-line interface.\n\nThe connection between both of these examples is the first task in\nunderstanding workflow: know your audience.\n\n## Roles\n\nPeople always have expectations. Our job is to understand, predict, and cater\nto fair expectations in our target audience. To understand these expectations,\nwe need to understand our audience. Although communities are a breeding ground\nfor diversity of personality, experience, and background, we can often see\nsimilarities in expectations, skills, experience, and approaches between\npeople who have a shared interest in a particular type of work, be it\nprogramming, documentation, testing, advocacy, or whatever else.\n\nConsider programmers as an example. We know we can assume a certain amount of\ntechnical knowledge: programmers indulge in a technical art form. They spend\ntheir days engaging in technical conversations and manipulating technology to\ntheir needs. You can’t push these assumptions too far, though. A Windows power\nuser and a low-level assembly device driver writer are both “technically\ntrained,” but in different ways. Technical experience comes in many forms. It\nis important for us to see the correlations, but also to keep track of\nsubcategories.\n\nRoles are critical in identifying preconceptions and experience. Using\nprogrammers again as an example, it is reasonable to assume that a programmer\nwill know how to use an operating system reasonably well, know much of the\njargon associated with computers, and be fairly self-sufficient in solving\ntechnical problems. Each attribute is common in programmers. We draw these\nparallels from two primary methods: _observation_ and _experience_.\n\nUnderstanding the audience requires observing them in their natural\nenvironment. If you want to make bug triage as simple as possible, sit down\nand watch someone triage a number of bugs. In fact, watch a range of people\ntriage bugs. If you want to understand how to run a booth at a conference\nefficiently, watch how people set up booths and how they talk to people. As\nyou observe your community engaging in their workflow, ask them to comment on\nit, telling you what frustrates and annoys them and what works well. This\nfeedback is always valuable. Identify the parallels between the multiple\npeople who perform the same type of task (such as programming), and you begin\nto build a mental picture of their expectations and experience.\n\nYour own experience will also guide how you build strong community and\nidentify with these different roles. Repeated experiences in particular can be\ncritical for understanding what is going on.\n\nI had a colleague who made sales to big companies. On his first big deal, he\nwent through an intense set of emotions. He first built confidence while the\nclient was excited about the product. As the negotiations moved forward, he\nwas cautious but confident. All was going well until he hit a roadblock in the\nnegotiations. It was an emotionally difficult time: he was about to close a\nbig deal, he was excited but stressed, and he was losing sleep and was\nconstantly anxious to check email. What my colleague didn’t know at the time\nwas that this was part of practically every deal: every deal hit a roadblock\nand every deal had moments of doubt. After a few more deals, his experience\ntaught him what was the norm in his world. From then on he knew how to manage\nhis expectations. Your own experience will uncover similar secrets about the\nroles you are seeking to understand.\n\nImportantly, your community members can help you to understand these roles,\ntoo, but you really need to figure out their current workflow and ask them for\nspecific feedback about its different parts. Have a series of frank and honest\nconversations about the overall workflow. This provides community members with\nan opportunity to share how the workflow benefits their lives and how it\ncomplicates them. You should also get to know their general perspectives and\nopinions that surround the workflow. As an example, if you are talking to a\nprogrammer, ask for her opinions on related topics such as testing, bugs and\ntriage, translations, code commenting, documentation, and other topics; this\nwill help you build a better sense of her views and expectations. While having\nthese conversations, take copious notes: the devil is almost always in the\ndetails, and you don’t want to lose anything.\n\n## Building a Simple Workflow\n\nAfter establishing roles, we now need to sit down and flesh out a workflow. In\nthis chapter our focus is on technical, tool-based workflow, so we will assess\nthe technical steps involved in achieving a goal. To do this we will identify\nan “OBJECTIVE,” the “AUDIENCE,” and then a number of “OUTCOME” steps that can\nachieve the objective. An example will best illustrate how that works.\n\nWhen I was involved in Jokosher, we wanted people to test the application and\nprovide feedback. We wanted to take a snapshot of the application for members\nof our community to test and tell us when things went wrong. This would give\nus an opportunity to fix remaining bugs. That helps us produce the first item\nin our workflow specification, the objective that you want to achieve:\n\nOBJECTIVE: To have more users install and test a development snapshot of\nJokosher and provide feedback on bugs.  \n---  \n  \nThe next step is to identify the audience. We did not want developers to test\nJokosher; we wanted real users to test it. We wanted people to use Jokosher\nfor real music production and make assumptions based on real use cases.\n\nThe Risks of Autopilot\n\nA common problem that can occur when observing how people use software is when\nthe user knows of a particular quirk in a product and works to naturally avoid\ntriggering the quirk. This is common with software developers, and before\nrelease, the software typically is not used in the same manner as it is by\nnormal users after release.\n\nA good antidote to this problem is to simply put new users in front of the\nsoftware who are entirely unaware of the quirks and oddities. They can often\npresent the most valuable feedback.\n\nLet’s now add our audience to our spec:\n\nAUDIENCE: Musicians or audiophiles who have basic computer knowledge.  \n---  \n  \nThe next step is in describing the primary pieces in the workflow. At this\npoint we’re just identifying the major steps; we’ll add the details later. Add\nthese as a series of OUTCOME items. For example:\n\nOUTCOME: Install a current snapshot of Jokosher and all required dependencies.  \n---  \nOUTCOME: Use and test primary features in Jokosher.  \nOUTCOME: Provide feedback about bugs.  \n  \nThese three outcomes are the major steps involved in achieving our OBJECTIVE.\nThe next step is to combine our AUDIENCE with each OUTCOME.\n\nThis is the most important part of the process, where we assess how to make\nour workflow as simple and attuned to our audience as possible. Let’s look at\nour first OUTCOME in the preceding list as an example. We need to combine this\nwith our audience of new users. How can we make it as easy as possible to\ninstall Jokosher for a user base that is not technically sophisticated?\n\nWhen we were faced with this challenge, we considered a range of options. We\nheard some suggestions to provide simple documentation that would show people\nhow to compile code and install dependencies. That was too technical and\ncomplex as an option. There were also suggestions to make packages available\nfor each distribution. That required skills that were not present in the team,\nand would involve sourcing external help.\n\nThe ideal scenario was that someone could simply download a file and Jokosher\nwould run: this matched our audience profile. It would be simple, easy, and\nefficient, perfect for our users. Stuart Langridge produced a script that\ndownloaded the Jokosher code, installed the relevant dependencies on the\nuser’s system, and ran Jokosher with a click of the mouse. The script checked\nto see whether the dependencies were already installed, and skipped their\ninstallation if they were. The user could use the same script for the first\nrun and subsequent runs, and not even think about the concept of installation.\nSimple.\n\nIn the workflow spec, you should document each step from the perspective of\nyour AUDIENCE. For the Jokosher installation example:\n\n  * OUTCOME: Install a current snapshot of Jokosher and all required dependencies.\n\n    * Download a script from jokosher.org.\n\n    * Make the script executable (explained with documentation).\n\n    * Double-click the icon to run the script and install Jokosher.\n\n    * To rerun, double-click the icon again.\n\nThis process was as simple as we could make it for the user. The hardest part\nwas making the script executable, and there is no safe technical solution to\nautomate that process. Our solution also required few resources to develop,\njust the time for one person to produce the script instead of lots of\npackagers to package Jokosher for every conceivable Linux distribution.\n\nOnce you have written your workflow steps into your functional spec, you\nshould go through each step and ask the following questions of it:\n\n  * Is this step really required?\n\n  * How easy is this step to understand? Could it be simplified?\n\n  * Are the requirements easy to obtain or access?\n\nWhen you have applied these questions to each step, you can apply these\nquestions to the entire workflow:\n\n  * Is this workflow as efficient as it could be?\n\n  * Is this the most intuitive approach to the workflow?\n\n  * Is this workflow scalable?\n\nIf you have satisfied each question, you should have a pretty rock-solid\nworkflow in place.\n\n## The Mechanics of Collaboration\n\nEarlier in the book we added a critically important item to our Community TODO\nList.\n\norm:swap-title: Community TODO List\n\n  * Build an environment conducive to our wider goals.\n\nThe operative word here is _conducive_. What does that mean, though? How\nexactly do we optimize our environment for the purpose of achieving our goals?\n\nCollaboration is all about working together for a common purpose, opening up a\nchannel in which content can flow between interested parties for the purpose\nof building something interesting. This content and the tools that make it\nflow are the _mechanics of collaboration_.\n\nCollaboration is a form of conversation, a reciprocal back-and-forth of\ncommunication around a common topic. At the heart of all conversations are at\nleast two people and a:\n\n  * Shared language\n\n  * Shared topic\n\n  * Communication channel\n\nImagine a normal spoken debate taking place in a London pub. The shared\nlanguage may be English, the topic could be how effective the prime minister\nis, and the communication channel is the spoken word (lubricated with a pint\nof something cold). These simple attributes combine to create a thread of\nresponses, each building on the previous statement. This combination of\nresponses comprises a conversation.\n\n## An Example: Ubuntu Bug Workflow\n\nTechnical collaboration has similar components and similar results. The\nmechanics of collaboration are so important because when you understand what\nconversations occur, you can optimize how people converse. Take bugs, for\nexample. Every piece of software ever written has bugs. Software is written by\npeople, people make mistakes, and bugs are human mistakes formed as bits and\nbytes.\n\nMost software projects use a special piece of software called a bug tracker to\nhave a bug conversation. Someone files a bug. Someone else asks for more\ninformation on the bug. Those who are affected by the bug offer clues and\ninformation. Someone else may propose a fix. People try the fix and provide\nfeedback. The essence of conversation is the same: a shared language\n(English), a shared topic (exploring and fixing the bug), and a communication\nchannel (the Web).\n\nWhen considering how to build your community’s infrastructure and tools, you\nneed to identify what these mechanics of collaboration are. You need to think\ncarefully about how people have conversations, both in natural language (such\nas discussions) and in technical language (such as with bugs). When you\nunderstand the driving forces behind how conversations occur, you can make\nsome really interesting things happen.\n\nAwhile back my team spent some time working on optimizing the conversation\naround bugs. Before I explain the solution, let’s take the problem for a spin.\n\nIn the open source world, bugs are a complex topic, and they are particularly\ncomplicated for Linux distributions. Consider the problem. Erica is using\nUbuntu and experiences a problem in the text editor: when she tries to\nspellcheck, the editor crashes.\n\nAs an experienced open source citizen, she is familiar with the mantra that\nwhen something goes wrong, you should report it. She clicks the Help menu in\nthe text editor and clicks on “Report a problem...” to report the bug. At this\npoint she now expects someone in Ubuntu to tend to the bug report and\nhopefully fix it. So far, so good.\n\nNow it gets a little more complicated. The text editor in Ubuntu is actually\ncalled GEdit. It is an open source project that is part of the\n[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) desktop. The GNOME project is an independent\nproject that produces software, and the open source parlance for this kind of\nproject refers to it as an _upstream_ project.\n\nUbuntu developers take the upstream GNOME source code (including GEdit) and\nbuild packages to ship it in Ubuntu. When this code is built, some\nmodifications are made to make GNOME (and as such, GEdit) integrate well in\nUbuntu. This includes consistent themes, file dialog boxes, folder locations,\nand more. In a nutshell, Ubuntu takes the original upstream source code, adds\nsome changes, builds it, and ships the final product as part of Ubuntu.\n\nThis raises our first question: who is responsible for the bug? Was the bug\npresent in the original upstream code from GNOME? Was it in the changes made\nby Ubuntu developers? Does the bug exist outside GNOME and GEdit? Does the bug\neven exist at all? Fortunately, this is a fairly simple question to answer:\nsome quick checking of the upstream code can usually identify the source of\nthe bug.\n\nThe second question is the one that is pertinent to our bug conversation. How\ndo we deal with the bug report? Erica rightly reported the bug, but should she\nreport it in the Ubuntu bug tracker (called Launchpad) or the GNOME bug\ntracker? In addition to this, many other people may have experienced the bug.\nSome will report it in their distribution’s bug tracker and some will report\nit in the upstream bug tracker. It is not entirely inconceivable that there is\na bug report in each distribution’s bug tracker and one in the upstream bug\ntracker all pointing to the same bug. This is hugely wasteful.\n\nRegardless of all this duplication of effort, if the bug exists upstream and\nthe distribution ships it, the bug _does_ still exist in the distribution and\nit _does_ exist upstream. The challenge is to bring these different bug\nconversations together so that everyone who experiences the bug can share his\nexperience to fix it. The solution to this problem is to identify how the flow\nof conversation and collaboration happens between these different bug reports\nand to optimize it.\n\nFortunately, software can address these issues. Launchpad, the web service\nthat Ubuntu uses as a bug tracker, already had the ability to link bugs,\nwhether they’re in the same tracker or a different one. When Erica filed her\nbug, she or someone else could connect her bug to an existing bug in an\nupstream bug tracker. It works like this:\n\n  1. If the developer knows the bug is an upstream bug but does not know which bug it is in the upstream bug tracker, he can add an _upstream task_ to the bug report. This upstream task indicates that the bug should be linked to an upstream bug when it is found.\n\n  2. If the developer knows the bug in the upstream bug tracker matches the Ubuntu bug, he can link the two bugs. This involves finding the Ubuntu bug and using the Link feature in Launchpad to enter the URL of the upstream bug.\n\nWhen a bug is linked, any changes made to the upstream bug are synchronized in\nLaunchpad and vice versa. This feature connects the two separate\nconversations.\n\n### Getting to know the problem\n\nAlthough this is a hugely useful and valuable feature, we got the impression\nthat not enough bugs were getting linked. The problem I wanted my team to\nsolve was to explore why these bugs were not being linked, and to help\nincrease the linkages.\n\nAlthough we had a hunch that not that many people were linking bugs, we really\nhad no idea. We had no concrete statistics to back up our assumptions. Our\nfirst task was to learn more about the problem.\n\nTo do this we produced a tool called the Ubuntu Upstream Report. The report\nmined the Launchpad bug tracker to show the top 100 upstreams shipped in\nUbuntu ordered by the greatest number of open bugs. We knew that these 100\nupstreams were likely to be the largest and most significant projects: more\nbugs in the open source world typically means larger projects with more users\nusing the software and therefore filing more bugs.\n\nFor each upstream in the report, we showed which bugs were open, which had\nbeen triaged to determine they were actually bugs, which were known to be\nupstream bugs (marked as upstream tasks), and which had linkages associated\nwith those tasks.\n\nThe differences between the numbers generated interesting conclusions. As an\nexample, if a project had a significant difference between the number of\n_open_ bugs and the number of _triaged_ bugs, we knew which projects needed\nmore help with bug triage.\n\nA key conclusion that we discovered was the difference in many projects\nbetween the _upstream tasks_ and the _linked bugs_ numbers. As an example, one\nproject had 229 bugs with upstream tasks but only 101 of those bugs had\nupstream links. This left a total of 128 bugs that were known to be upstream\nbugs that didn’t have linkages. This told us the project was not linking bugs\nwell and needed help. It also told us which specific bugs were known to be\nupstream bugs without linkages. We could use these bugs as a target for our\ncommunity to make those linkages.\n\n### Breaking down the conversation\n\nThe raw data in the upstream report was the foundation of not only exploring\nthe problem, but also solving it. The data confirmed our suspicion that a lot\nof bugs weren’t being linked. On a practical level, it helped us to understand\nwhich upstreams needed help, and therefore which contributors to speak to.\n\nTo raise the number of linked bugs, we needed to identify the three key\naspects of the bug-handling process (reporting, triage, and linking) and\nimprove them. Our first area to focus on was linking, as it was the most\nimmediate goal. We examined and optimized each step in the process of linking\na bug. We discovered, for example, that finding bugs in the upstream bug\ntracker took the most time, so we explored methods of syncing bug data across\nthe Launchpad and upstream bug reports automatically, automating duplication\nsearches, and simplifying the user interface for the whole shebang.\n\nOur next step was to optimize the reporting and triage process. This was an\narea in which we had already poured extensive work, and our workflow here was\ngenerally pretty good. Where there appeared to be a disconnect, though, was\nwith documentation and people reading and making use of that documented best\npractice. Although there was plenty of documentation, it was scattered all\nover the Ubuntu wiki, difficult to navigate, and complex to read. We\nreorganized and improved it, dividing it into better sections and making it\neasier to understand. We organized documentation days; encouraged community\nparticipation; celebrated the improvements; and encouraged our bug triagers to\nreview, expand, and make use of the new documentation that was produced.\n\n### Lessons learned\n\nThis example reflects a useful approach to help you “build an environment\nconducive to our wider goals.” Its key themes likely apply to your community:\n\n  1. Identify the primary ways in which you collaborate. These are the areas in which your tools and workflow should be as flawless and intuitive as possible. In our example, we identified bugs as a key area.\n\n  2. Understand the problem. How does your community understand and engage in the process you are exploring? Which parts of the problem are more problematic than others? What do you want to achieve? In our example, we knew that linking was a problem, and focused on it.\n\n  3. Break down the workflow. When you understand your areas of focus, examine the process and ask whether each step is entirely necessary or could be improved.\n\nThese three simple steps are all based on the principles of understanding the\nproblem and making a solution that is as simple as possible. _Simplicity_ is a\nkey goal in everything we do with community.\n\n# Building Great Infrastructure\n\nConsider the humble can opener. Years ago, to use a can opener you had to\nplace a very small cutting blade on the lip of the can, ensure that it hooked\nover correctly, and then twist the handle, invariably making your fingers\nache. As you twisted the handle, the blade often slipped off the can. Even\nwhen you had managed to get the lid off the can, you might cut your finger on\nthe lid or the sharp top of the can. We now have electric can openers in which\nyou simply press a button and the lid is cut and taken off for you. Even\nmanual can openers are effortless and go so far as to blunt the lid and the\ntop of the can. Manufacturers were well aware of the problems and explored the\nworkflow and potential solutions to evolve their tools.\n\nCollaborative online projects need a diverse set of supporting tools to\nflourish. Even the simplest community will use tools for communicating,\nstoring work, and sharing information. Many communities build on top of these\nstaples with a variety of tools and facilities for different functions in the\ncommunity. Different contributors have different needs for their types of\ncontribution. Developers need bug trackers, patch systems, and version\ncontrol; documentation writers need wikis, text processing tools, and editors;\ntranslators need translation tools; testers need test suites; and everyone\nneeds to communicate with everyone else.\n\nIt’s tempting to go out and set up a wide range of tools, but think carefully\nabout how your tools integrate. An efficient and integrated set of tools will\nbe far more pleasurable to work with than a completely disconnected set of\ntools.\n\nFor years I have been playing music, and writing and recording my own songs in\nmy home studio. As a strong believer in a Free Culture music industry,\n[Severed Fifth](http://www.severedfifth.com) was my contribution. This was a\nproject I set up to change perceptions of the music industry while writing and\nplaying music. I wrote, produced, and recorded an entire solo metal album and\nreleased it under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. I set out\nto build a community around the project and the music, incorporating many\nfeatures into the site: news, a blog, forums, static web pages, and more. I\nwanted the entire site to feel as integrated as possible. My friend Stuart\nimplemented a single user account that worked with all features on the site.\nAlthough the site consisted of two WordPress blogs, a Vanilla forum, and some\nstatic web pages, having an integrated account and an integrated look and feel\nmade all of the separate components feel like a single well-oiled machine.\n\nIntegration offers a range of opportunities for collaborative projects.\nWorkflow is the foundation for identifying these avenues of integration.\nWorkflow is a larger process that can contain many individual components.\n\nTake, for example, the workflow to fix a bug. A simplified process could\ninvolve finding a bug in the bug tracker, checking out the code, writing a\npatch to fix it, attaching the patch to the bug report, and informing the\ndevelopers of the fix. This workflow involves three separate tools: the bug\ntracker, the source repository, and the mailing list. It could arguably\ninvolve additional tools, such as those required to produce the fix and\ngenerate the patch. There are many areas in which the tools could be\nintegrated:\n\n  * The bug tracker and source control system could use the same login credentials.\n\n  * The bug tracker could display recent branches in the source control system that refer to a specific bug number in the changelog.\n\n  * When a patch is attached to a bug report or a bug status changes, that could generate an automatic email to the project mailing list to inform the community that a fix has been made available.\n\n  * When a fix is sent to the mailing list with a bug number, additional information from the bug tracker could be automatically added to the message.\n\nEvery project has the opportunity to draw similar integration opportunities\nbetween the different tools in the workflow. The key is in identifying how\ndifferent tools can talk to each other in useful ways.\n\nThe first time I experienced this firsthand was with Jokosher. When the\nproject started, we needed the following facilities:\n\n  * Source control\n\n  * Online commit log history\n\n  * Source viewing\n\n  * Bug tracking\n\n  * Wiki\n\nOne approach was to set up a number of separate tools to provide these\nfacilities. We could have set up Bazaar, WebCVS, Bugzilla, MediaWiki, and\nother tools. Each tool would be largely insulated from the others, and each\nwould have a separate account. Our final solution was to use a system called\n[Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/).\n\nTrac is a popular project management and software development system that\nprovides an easy-to-use and integrated system for source control, issue\ntracking, commit logs, and a wiki. We used a hosting company called Python-\nHosting (now WebFaction; <http://www.webfaction.com/>) that offered a free\nTrac instance for open source projects. Trac was simple, integrated, and\nhugely productive.\n\nTrac was by no means the only option. Systems like\n[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/) existed, but with Jokosher development\nso new, SourceForge felt like a very large hammer to crack a very small nut.\nIntegration can go too far, and some software development solutions can\ninclude oodles of features and facilities that simply distract from what is\nimportant. Back then, SourceForge was vexed with this problem. Eventually\nJokosher outgrew Python-Hosting and settled on\n[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/).\n\n## Software As a Service\n\nThe Jokosher example raises an important question when it comes to\nintegration. Do you want to run the toolchain facilities yourself or use an\nexisting online system?\n\nIntegration has always been a challenge in IT, and subsequently many companies\nhave sprung up to provide solutions. I have already mentioned Sourceforge and\nLaunchpad, but there are many more. These solutions put integration at the\ncenter of their offering: they can give you most of the tools that you need in\na single integrated system. These online services are often referred to as the\n_cloud_ or _Software as a Service_ (SaaS).\n\nMany new projects make the mistake of setting up their own tools for the sake\nof just controlling the tools themselves. This is a shortsighted perspective.\nBut it’s equally shortsighted to simply use an existing online service without\nthinking through your needs now and for the immediate life cycle of the\nproject. Let’s think through some of these choices right now.\n\nWe should first look through the different attributes of both approaches.\nLet’s start with benefits. Self-hosted systems offer a number of benefits and\ndisadvantages, listed in [Table\n5-1](ch05.html#benefits_and_disadvantages_of_self-hoste \"Table 5-1. Benefits\nand disadvantages of self-hosted systems\").\n\nTable 5-1. Benefits and disadvantages of self-hosted systems\n\nBenefits |  Disadvantages  \n---|---  \nControl—you have complete control of the toolchain. You can always add features, facilities, and additional software where you see fit. |  Maintenance—having control is a double-edged sword. It requires care and feeding, security updates, and the installation of additional software.  \nChoice—you can choose which tools you want to use in your community. |  Cost—if you host your own tools, you need to provide the hosting and bandwidth.  \n  \nNow let’s look at the benefits and disadvantages of a cloud-based solution,\nlisted in [Table 5-2](ch05.html#benefits_and_disadvantages_of_cloud-base\n\"Table 5-2. Benefits and disadvantages of SaaS-based solutions\").\n\nTable 5-2. Benefits and disadvantages of SaaS-based solutions\n\nBenefits |  Disadvantages  \n---|---  \nEase—setting up your entire toolchain could be as simple as registering with a SaaS solution. |  Data—when you use a SaaS solution, you put your data on someone else’s system. You have to continually back up your data outside the cloud, in case that provider goes away intermittently or permanently.  \nMaintenance—in the cloud, someone else looks after security and updates, so you don’t have to. |  Bandwidth limitations—some cloud providers limit disk space, bandwidth, and other attributes in a project. You may hit these limitations.  \nPotential reliability—SaaS solutions are typically hosted on high-bandwidth networks with a powerful backbone. This could potentially offer improved reliability over a self-hosted solution. |  Tool choice—if you pick a SaaS provider, it may provide 80% of the tool choice that you want, but may choose a different tool for another part of your workflow. This could potentially limit what you want to do.  \n  \nAt this point your head is probably spinning with options, and you may be\nunsure of what to choose. My recommendation is almost always to choose a SaaS-\nbased solution.\n\nSaaS-based solutions offer one major benefit: lower maintenance. The last\nthing you want to be doing in your community is spending time fiddling with\ntools. You should instead be focusing your efforts on growing community,\nbuilding a team, and achieving the objectives and goals you outlined in your\nstrategic plan. Online resources such as Launchpad and Sourceforge are\nexcellent solutions to this problem. They give you everything you need, and\nthey put the maintenance and bandwidth responsibility in someone else’s hands.\n\nThis recommendation comes with a caveat, however. We are still in the early\ndays of the cloud, and it’s difficult to know how stable the cloud will prove\nto be in future years. Many of the Internet companies that were prominent five\nyears ago are either no longer around, have been acquired, or have otherwise\nfaded into obscurity. When you put your data in the cloud, you face the risk\nthat your provider may suffer these consequences.\n\nI also worry about SaaS security perceptions. Storing data on a third-party\nservice requires trust: trust in the provider and trust in the concept of the\ncloud. When that trust is compromised, the entire industry suffers. The\nairline industry has experienced this. When the attacks on the World Trade\nCenter happened on September 11, 2001, all air travel felt unsafe. People\navoided flying like the plague. The entire industry suffered due to a\nperception that air travel was no longer safe.\n\nIf one of the large cloud providers faces privacy or security issues, the\nconcept of the cloud will feel unsafe and the industry will suffer. The risk\nto you is that if the cloud industry suffers and your data is on the cloud,\nyour data could potentially go away. You need to assess the current industry\nand keep abreast of the risks involved.\n\nBack Up the Cloud\n\nIf you do decide to go with a third-party online SaaS provider, I again\nstrongly recommend that you have a backup solution in place, just in case you\nface these problems. Always ensure that if your provider goes away, it still\ncan be business as usual in your community.\n\n# Avoiding Resource Fetishism\n\nBefore we move on to look at some of the technical specifics of different\ntools, I just want to spend a little time talking about a problem that faces a\nrange of new collaborative communities.\n\nThe problem looks a little like this:\n\n  1. A new community is born around a goal. This goal could be to produce software, change the political landscape, or anything else.\n\n  2. The founders of the community set up the communication channels, and some early members join.\n\n  3. Additional tools are required. This could involve a website, blogging tools, technical development facilities, or anything else.\n\n  4. Using a website as an example, a discussion kicks off asking which content management system should be used. A long and drawn-out debate starts over which system to use. These debates can drag on for a long time.\n\nI have seen this same scenario happen over and over again. There is nothing\nwrong with wanting to choose the best tools for your community, but you need\nto get your priorities straight.\n\nWhen you set up a new community, one priority is more important than all\nothers: _building a team_. Your #1 goal is to get people involved. You need to\nget people inspired to join your crusade. If you don’t attract people and get\nthem up and running and productive as soon as possible, your community will\nfeel like it is treading water.\n\nDebates over which tool to use should be kept as short and sweet as possible.\nYou should seek to establish requirements and gain consensus around a chosen\ntool as quickly as you can. Always remember that these discussions will garner\nstrong opinions for different tools. You will never make everyone happy, so\nyou need to identify the requirements and pick something as soon as viably\npossible. The sooner you get your tools up and running and get people focused\non doing useful work, the better.\n\n# Technical Considerations\n\nMost of this chapter has focused on best practices for assessing optimal\nworkflow for a project, staying detached enough from specific technologies so\nthat the information can apply to any kind of community and workflow. The next\nfew pages delve into some technical specifics of particular interest to\nsoftware projects, such as bug tracking, source control, and collaborative\nediting.\n\nAs we cover these topics I am going to deliberately avoid recommending\nspecific solutions or pieces of software. This is because software changes a\nlot more quickly than books do, and the last thing I want to do is recommend a\npiece of software that has since become unsuitable for your requirements.\nInstead, the following pages will advise you of some key considerations that\nyou should keep in mind when evaluating which tools you want to use to solve a\nparticular problem.\n\nWhen evaluating specific software solutions, you should meld the advice here\nwith your current requirements. You should also factor in predicted\nrequirements for the next three years. If you can find a solution that will\nkeep your project productive for three years, you have hit the jackpot. Our\ngoal here is to keep migration to new systems to a minimum: migration is\ndisruptive, complex, and time-consuming.\n\n## Bug Tracking\n\nBug tracking is a critical part of any software project, particularly open\nsource projects. It is one of the core mechanics of how your project works. It\nshould be a central part of your development process and a daily component for\neach of your developers.\n\nA range of bug-tracking solutions are available, from those your project hosts\n(such as Bugzilla) to third-party-hosted systems (such as Launchpad). Bug\ntrackers vary hugely in terms of features. Some are simple, designed for small\nprojects with a small number of developers. Some are hugely complex,\ninfinitely customizable behemoths of functionality.\n\nBefore you choose a bug tracker, you should evaluate your requirements. Do you\nneed a simple bug tracker to merely maintain a list of defects in your\nsoftware, or do you need a complex solution with custom fields, multiple\nprojects, teams, automation, and other features?\n\nA common temptation for new open source projects is to install the most\nfeature-packed bug tracker available. The reasoning behind this is usually\n“just in case we need those features.”\n\nWhatever your needs, always keep usability as a key requirement in picking a\nbug tracker. If you use a solution that is too complex, it will annoy\npotential bug reporters and most certainly annoy those performing triage.\n\nTransparency in Bug Tracking\n\nYou should ensure that your project’s bug tracker is publicly available and\nthat anyone and everyone can access it. As such, you should not restrict\nviewing the bug tracker to username and password access.\n\nThere are many reasons for this:\n\n  * There is no need to restrict bug information if it affects a collaborative community project.\n\n  * Users who are experiencing problems can search quickly and easily for information that might help them fix the problem.\n\n  * Eric Raymond, a well-known open source proponent, once uttered, “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” Open bug tracking provides an excellent opportunity for community members who are blighted by the same bug to explore, share notes, and possibly even fix the bug together.\n\nThe only time I consider a closed bug tracker or private bug reports to be\nsuitable for community projects is when Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) work\nfor a specific vendor is occurring, but in a manner that does not compromise\nthe wider project. Bugs that affect the wider project should never be private.\n\n### Bug reporting\n\nYou should make every effort to make bug reporting as easy as possible. Some\nprojects (such as Ubuntu) embed a link into an application that simplifies\nthis process. Ubuntu also uses a special tool called Apport to bundle up\ndebugging information to send to the bug tracker automatically when something\ncrashes. This is a useful feature, as traditionally many developers doing\ntriage would ask bug reporters to enter a series of commands that gather\ndebugging information and add it to the report. Apport\n(<https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport>) automates this process.\n\nOther projects make the act of reporting the bug on the bug tracker as easy as\npossible. An example of this is Jokosher, which only asks for a Subject and\nDescription of the bug, leaving it up to the Jokosher triage team to manage\nthe rest of the information. It is important to remember that your bug\nreporters are unlikely to know most of the requirements for a bug report.\n\nAnother project that has taken an interesting approach is GNOME. GNOME\nproduced a simplified frontend to its [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/) bug\ntracker, and the tracker asks only a few simple questions. It is recommended\nthat you keep your own bug reporting frontend as simple as possible.\n\n### Bug triage\n\nFor each bug that comes into your bug tracker, various decisions need to be\nmade. This includes confirming whether it is actually a bug, asking for\nadditional information from the reporter, assigning the bug to people or\nteams, and classifying the urgency of the bug.\n\nTriage is a process that your developers will typically need to engage in, and\nfew developers want to spend any more time on it than is absolutely necessary.\nAs such, triage should be as straightforward and painless as possible.\nUnderstanding bug workflow, ensuring that it is simple and effective, and\npicking a suitable bug tracker is a critical part of this process.\n\nAs your project grows, you likely will become inundated with bug reports. As\nthe bug reports flow in, it is also likely that your developers simply won’t\nhave time to triage the bugs as well as fix them. As such, you may need to\nconsider setting up a dedicated triage team. This, my friends, is a path that\nyou should tread carefully.\n\nTriagers straddle a delicate middle ground in your community. On the far left\nare your users who have been gracious enough to report a bug in the interests\nof it being fixed and benefiting the wider community. This is a generous gift\non their part, and this gift should be rewarded with the attention it\ndeserves. On the far right are your developers who have only so many hours in\nthe day to fix bugs. If the developers don’t have enough time to triage the\nbugs, a triage team is expected to sit in the middle and help ensure that the\nreported bugs are assessed and then routed to the right developers. If this\nprocess is successful, all bugs get triaged and the most critical and\nimportant bugs get fixed promptly by the developers who have the most\nappropriate experience in that part of the code base. If the process is _not_\nsuccessful, the original users will grow resentful that their bug was\n“ignored,” and the developers will either drown in bugs (not enough triage),\nnever see bugs (lack of visibility in triage), or focus on the wrong bugs\n(wrong triage).\n\nThe process of setting up a triage team needs extensive work and resources to\nbe successful:\n\nDocumentation\n\n    \n\nYou’ll need extensive documentation about how to triage, what is involved,\nwhere to find help, how to respond to users to gather more information, and so\non.\n\nMentoring\n\n    \n\nNew triagers need to learn the ropes, and mentoring can help ensure that these\nnew contributors get up and running as quickly as possible.\n\nEvents\n\n    \n\nYou should organize bug days, meetings, triage events, and other methods of\ninspiring participation.\n\nCommunication\n\n    \n\nYour triagers should never become an island. They need to be in regular\ncontact with the developers and ensure that communication is flowing.\n\nAlthough it is certainly not impossible to set up a triaging team, and it\nseems like a fantastic method of contributing, many people often start with\ntriage and grow bored. You should expect this: it is part and parcel of this\nkind of contribution. Have faith, though, because there will be some people\nwho will join, enjoy, and stick with triage, and you should cherish these\ncontributors and help them to inspire others to get involved.\n\n## Source Control\n\nSource control has become an increasingly hot topic in the software\ndevelopment world. Once upon a time, the only real option was a tool called\nConcurrent Versions System (CVS). We then had an “easier CVS” come along in\nthe form of Subversion. Since then, we have seen the birth of the Distributed\nVersion Control System (DVCS), which adds even more functionality to source\ncontrol. The DVCS makes it easier than ever for new contributors to produce\nfeatures and fixes that can be merged into the main branch.\n\nI don’t want to get into a debate about which version control system to use;\nother resources can provide a far better assessment of that. One piece of\nadvice I do offer, however, is that you should strongly consider some of the\nintegrated tools that exist around these systems. As an example, the Launchpad\nsystem integrates tightly with the Bazaar DVCS and makes tasks such as\nreviewing merges and viewing changes a point-and-click affair. These kinds of\nfeatures can be hugely useful with such an important component in the software\ndevelopment toolchain.\n\n## Collaborative Editing\n\nBack in the early days of open source, we all lied to the world about\ndocumentation. “ _Want to get involved in open source but can’t write code?_\nSure you can help! Write documentation!”\n\nBack then, if you wanted to write documentation you needed to install a\ncomplex menagerie of text processing tools, write your documentation in a\nmarkup language, ensure that the document properly validated, and then convert\nthe documentation into something the user could read. In a nutshell, it was\nway too complex.\n\nMost people who write documentation for open source software projects would\nfall into the category of “power user.” They are technology enthusiasts who\nare not interested in the super-technical avenues of programming, but want to\nhelp out. Many of these people have good writing skills and a good knowledge\nof using the software, so the documentation fit is natural.\n\nWith Jokosher we wanted to acknowledge this profile of user. As such, instead\nof focusing on complex text processing tools, we encouraged our documentation\ncontributors to use a wiki. Those who did not know the wiki markup would use\nthe graphical wiki editor. We got some great contributions because we\nidentified the workflow with the type of contributor.\n\n# Building and Maintaining Transparency\n\nTransparency is a key theme not only throughout this book, but also throughout\ncommunity building in general. Openness is an important ingredient in healthy\ncommunities, and your community needs to feel that there is transparency\nthroughout its governance, processes, communication, and workflow.\n\nIn terms of workflow, transparency can be divided roughly into three areas:\n\nTool access\n\n    \n\nHow open and accessible are the tools that form the foundation of your\ncommunity and workflow?\n\nCommunication\n\n    \n\nHow open and accessible are the communication channels in your community?\n\nReporting\n\n    \n\nHow well do you report what your community is doing?\n\nEach of these areas is important for a healthy community. Let’s now spend some\ntime looking into them, and cover some of the key points in keeping your\ncommunity open and accessible.\n\nTransparency for New Contributors\n\nAn important area in terms of transparency is how people who are not yet\ntrusted contributors can contribute to the project to gain trust. This is\ncovered in [Chapter 4](ch04.html \"Chapter 4. Processes: Simple Is\nSustainable\").\n\n## Tool Access\n\nYou should always ensure that the tools you choose to use for your community\nare easy to access, well documented, and freely available.\n\nThis has historically been an important factor for most open source projects.\nIf you look at the majority of open source projects, the tools and\ndependencies they use are also entirely free and open source. An example of\nthis is the GNOME desktop environment. Not only is GNOME free and open, but\nthe tools used to build it also are free and open. This includes the toolkit\n(Gtk), C compiler (gcc), debugger (gdb), GUI designer (glade), and more.\n\nAlthough most open source projects use free tools, many projects do use\nproprietary tools. Some years back I spoke at a Microsoft\nDeveloperDeveloperDeveloper! Day in the United Kingdom. As an open source guy,\nI was expecting to be greeted with a healthy dose of suspicion. Not only was\neveryone incredibly welcoming, but there also was a surprisingly strong sense\nof community. There were a number of user groups and communities based around\nMicrosoft technology, and in addition to this, many Microsoft fans released\nopen source software, but they used proprietary Microsoft products to produce\nthe code.\n\nAlthough this is fine, I recommend using freely available tools. Contributing\nto a community where you can download the tool immediately for free is far\neasier than having to spend $300 on a tool before you can participate.\n\nWhen you have decided on your toolchain, you should ensure that it is well\ndocumented on your community’s website. You should specify:\n\n  * The tools that are used in your project\n\n  * Where you can obtain the tools required\n\n  * Instructions for how to use these tools to obtain the work your community produces (such as the source code for an application) and how to run it\n\nAnother useful goal to aim for, particularly with regard to software\ndevelopment, is to ensure that each contribution is documented. Ideally, you\nwant any contributor to be able to point to any of her contributions by\nreferencing a URL on the Internet. If every contribution can be referenced,\nyour community will be transparent by definition.\n\nAn example of this is how many open source projects have mailing lists that\nget posted to automatically with each new commit to the source control system.\nThis simple solution ensures that anyone can subscribe to a list of source\ncode updates. One alternative to a mailing list is an RSS feed of updates.\n\n## Communications\n\nOpenness in communication is essential. Your communication channels are the\nvery lifeblood of how ideas, problems, and solutions flow between the\ndifferent members of your community. The golden rule here is to ensure that\nanyone (including those who are not currently part of your community) can\nreference every communication online after it has occurred. I would like to be\nable to go to any community and read conversations that I was not a part of so\nthat I can evaluate the decisions that were made.\n\nThis is happening today in most open source projects. Most projects have open\nmailing lists, and these lists have publicly visible archives that are\nautomatically made available on the Web. Many communities also have small\nprograms called _bots_ that log IRC conversations and make the discussions\navailable on the Web.\n\nI would highly recommend making these kinds of archives and logs available. In\nmany cases, doing so is as simple as switching on a configuration option. The\nonly time I consider it reasonable to have private archives is when a\ncommunication channel is being run by a Community Council. For many\ncommunities, sensitive and private discussions, particularly those around\nconflict, are taken to the council. There are also conversations that pertain\nto an individual, such as if a contributor has had some complaints made about\nhim. These kinds of discussions need honest input from the council members,\nand if archives of the conversation are available, many council members will\nfeel uncomfortable making statements they would otherwise make in private.\nJust compare and contrast the statements you make in public and in private.\n\nTransparency in communications is not purely about the free availability of\narchives, though. It is also about ensuring that everyone in your community is\nwelcome to participate and communicate in an open manner. There is one enemy\nto this kind of participation— _cliques_.\n\nCliques exist everywhere. Some of them are pronounced, such as the thousands\nof invitation-only clubs and associations across the world. Some of them are\nless pronounced, such as the informal, unwritten, yet obvious groupings that\noccur when we are all at school. There is nothing wrong with groups; they are\nnatural functions of human social interaction. But they can be destructive in\ncommunities that are explicit about their openness to new contributors.\n\nI noticed this for the first time years ago when I set up my Linux User Group\nin Wolverhampton. As the group grew and regular members attended, a sense of\nfamiliarity set in. There were insider jokes, everyone knew the regulars, and\nthe group was generally bonding. Although we welcomed new members, we\noccasionally heard of people being put off due to “cliquishness.” Although you\nshould not have overt cliques in your community, you also should not inhibit\nthe ability for people to bond and form personal relationships.\n\nAs you continue to engage with your community, there are some members who will\nnaturally group together due to similar perspectives, senses of humor, or\nother attributions. Encourage and welcome these groups, but always be\ncognizant of the risk that these groups will be off-putting to new users.\nEveryone knows what it feels like to feel unwelcome, but not everyone knows\nwhat it feels like to be a possible cause of that feeling.\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe final aspect of transparency with regard to workflow is keeping everyone\non the same page. This is all about reporting.\n\nSome time ago, we wanted to improve how different parts of the Ubuntu\ncommunity communicate what they are working on. We have hundreds of\ncontributors all over the world, each working on different teams, and I was\nkeen to see a single web page from each team with bullet points containing\nwhat they had achieved that month.\n\nThis was something of a challenge. Reporting is not a natural by-product of\ncommunity, and most communities struggle at producing metadata such as this.\nCommunities are great at doing the work that interests them, but activity\nreports and additional information does not flow naturally. The only chance of\nmaking this work was to make the process as simple as possible, and to\nencourage as many people to engage in the process as possible.\n\nThe process I developed was about as simple as I could get. I had a set\ntemplate on the Ubuntu wiki, and each template was named for the given month.\nI asked all teams to get their feedback in by the 20th of every month. This\nwould leave a few days to tidy up any missing pieces of the report and\nannounce it on the 22nd of each month. For each team, I asked someone to be a\nteam reports contact, and every month I would nag the contact person to get\nher content in. Some teams would be as reliable as you could imagine. Some\nless so. In general, though, the team-reporting framework generated some\nuseful content.\n\nThe value of the team reports was obvious. They were well received, and it was\nfascinating and inspiring to see what everyone was working on. The approach I\nfleshed out could easily be rolled out to your own community. You should\nseriously consider it.\n\nAnother little story I will share about reporting was one that we faced at our\nUbuntu Developer Summits (UDS). At every UDS we would have a large number of\ndiscussion sessions, and we had some facilities in which people could listen\nin on the sessions through an audio stream and communicate with us via IRC.\nDespite these methods of engagement, we still wanted to release a set of\nproceedings from the summit. This would be a summary of decisions made at the\nUDS that would affect the development of the next version of Ubuntu.\n\nOur first shot at this was to produce a wiki page for each track at the UDS\nand ask attendees to update the page at the end of each session. It was a\nsimple process, but it got limited uptake. There simply was not time at the\nend of the sessions for people to summarize the agreements. As such, we got\nrelatively sparse proceedings for each track.\n\nFor the next UDS, we had a different idea. In recent years microblogging\nplatforms such as [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) and\n[identi.ca](http://identi.ca) had become a common part of many people’s\nworkflow. It was not uncommon to send out a quick “tweet” or “dent” to let the\nworld know what you are doing. We figured this could be an interesting\napproach for our proceedings at the UDS.\n\nTo do this, we conducted an interesting experiment that worked rather well.\nUsing identi.ca we registered an account for each track at the UDS. In each\ntrack room we had the login details for the account on the whiteboard. We\nwould then encourage everyone to microblog as the sessions continued. The\nfinal part of the process was to write a script that took each microblog entry\nand divided the messages into the relevant sessions. As an example, all the\nmessages on the community track between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. would be\nautomatically grouped under the heading “Making LoCo Teams Rock,” the name of\nthe session at that time on the community track.\n\nThe moral of this story is that to get effective reports, the method needs to\nbe as low-friction as possible. People were already used to microblogging, so\nasking people to microblog sessions was entirely natural for many people. This\nis the essence of effective reporting.\n\nCollaborative Text Editing\n\nAnother useful tool that has been a common staple at the UDS is a\ncollaborative and cross-platform text editor called\n[Gobby](http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/).\n\nIn the Gobby text editor, multiple people can edit the same document at the\nsame time. You see the changes that other people make in real time in your\ninstance of Gobby. It is a clever little tool.\n\nGobby is useful when multiple people are working together to record notes for\na session or working together on a specification or strategic document.\n\n# Regular Workflow Assessment\n\nLike any process, structure, governance, or other agreed method of working,\nworkflow should always be subject to change. Your workflow and the tools that\nare crystallized in it should always reflect the optimal way in which your\ncommunity can work. If the tools become too complex and too laborious, you\nshould consider adjusting your workflow, and possibly your tools as well.\n\nAn example of this occurred when I was involved in Jokosher. When the project\nstarted, we wanted a simple means of tracking issues and problems, and so we\nused the issue tracker that was part of our Trac development forge. We used\nthe issue tracker for a variety of purposes, and it was simple and effective.\n\nAs the project grew, we were building up to shipping a major release. The\nproject had more than doubled in size, and there was a significant chunk of\nfunctionality built into the application. When our community was reporting\nproblems in the issue tracker, they had to manually enter a lot of\ninformation, and tracking and prioritizing this increasing number of issues\nwas becoming a problem.\n\nAfter a short discussion on IRC, we decided to move to a full-fledged bug\ntracker. We chose Launchpad as our solution, and we never looked back.\nLaunchpad was more suitable, more flexible, and the right choice at that point\nin the Jokosher history.\n\nOne of the most useful lessons that I have learned in my community work is\nthat you should regularly reassess everything: your workflow, processes,\ngovernance, and anything else. A community is built on a set of rapidly\nchanging people, needs, and requirements. Regular reassessment is important to\nensure that your workflow is matching the day-to-day work of your community.\n\nI recommend that you set this regularity now. The length of time before\nreassessments is really up to you and your needs, although I would make sure\nto do a reassessment at least once a year.\n\n## Gathering Structured Feedback\n\nWhen performing your reassessment, your aim is to find solid feedback about\nthe good and bad aspects of your current workflow. The real value that you\nshould be seeking is constructive, objective feedback from those who really\ndig into the workflow. Those community members who are using the workflow day\nin, day out will have the most valuable feedback for you. Before you consider\nchanging any aspects of your workflow, you should gather an extensive level of\nfeedback and use it to identify correlations in aspects that work and don’t\nwork.\n\nA useful technique for getting good feedback is to produce an online survey.\nThere are a number of free survey sites that enable you to produce a set of\nquestions and have anyone fill in the survey. Many surveys also allow you to\nchoose between invitation-only responders and a free-for-all public survey.\nThis is an important decision when running the survey. There are benefits and\ndisadvantages to both. For open public surveys, there is always a risk of\ngetting a lot of inexperienced feedback that is not particularly useful, and\nthis noise can skew the results. On the other hand, public surveys feel more\ncommunity-spirited: they are open and accessible, and anyone can participate.\nInvitation-only surveys allow you to choose who responds, and if you choose\nwisely (read: not just people who will give you good feedback), you can get\nsome great objective and practical results. On the flip side, invitation-only\nsurveys feel closed, cliquey, and restrictive.\n\nI recommend you do both. Start out with an invitation-only survey with at\nleast 10 respondents. When you have this feedback gathered, open up the survey\nto anyone. Keep the public survey open for a set period (a month is a good\namount of time), and promote the survey in places where your community reads\nand resides. You can then use both sets of results to draw conclusions. I\nwould recommend that you put more faith in the invitation-only survey results,\nas they come from your key community members, but the public survey will\nundoubtedly uncover some useful results.\n\nWhen you have performed your surveys, you should schedule some meetings with\nyour community to discuss the results, propose solutions, and share more\nexperiences. As with normal meetings, these meetings should be very focused on\ndriving to a conclusion: finding solutions to the problems.\n\n# Moving On\n\nBuilding effective workflows is complex. It involves a combination of\nunderstanding people, technology, and usability. As is a common theme\nthroughout this book, you should look to simplicity as your inspiration. At\nevery step of the way, you need to ask questions: Is this more complicated\nthan it needs to be? Is this the most effective way to do this? Is my\ncommunity going to be able to follow this workflow every day and not get\nfrustrated?\n\nAlthough we covered a range of concepts in this chapter, don’t push yourself\ntoo hard. Experience and learning from your successes and mistakes is all part\nand parcel of being a great community leader. Some of the concepts in this\nchapter will take a little while to settle into your flow.\n\nWe are now going to move on to an essential part of leading a community:\ngetting people fired up! We have some great structure in place so far. Now\nit’s time to assemble an army....\n\n\n# Chapter 6. Social Media\n\n“In labouring to be concise, I become obscure.”\n\n—Horace\n\nYou are all wonderful people. Every last one of you; even you, Peter in\nBoston.[2] You are all so smart, so intelligent, and…have you lost weight?\n\nAstute readers may have detected a hint of ass-kissing. Well, guilty as\ncharged. This is not without good reason, though; unfortunately, I am going to\nsay something that might not sit well with some of you. I would be remiss,\nthough, if I wasn’t honest and frank with you lovely, intelligent,\nattractive…forgiving…people.\n\n_Social media is completely overrated_.\n\nOK, now that we have that gristly chunk out on the table, I can try to claw\nback your respect and explain exactly what I mean.\n\nBack in May 2008 I sat in a hotel in Prague in the Czech Republic at the twice\nannual Ubuntu Developer Summit. On the sleepy Sunday afternoon before the\nevent started I was working in the lobby with a group of colleagues and\ncommunity members. One of those community members was Alan “popey” Pope, a\nfriend of mine who I got to know through LugRadio and who was an active member\nof the Ubuntu community.\n\nThat afternoon, Alan and a few others were raving about Twitter, which at the\ntime was starting to build momentum but was still largely the forte of geeks\nand computer nerds. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Twitter, it is a\nwebsite in which people can send short messages and follow one another’s\nmessages.\n\nAlan had become a big fan of Twitter and extolled the many benefits, uses, and\ngeneral good times of being on Twitter. I, however, stubbornly resisted. Back\nthen, when asked about my views on Twitter, I used the often-trundled-out\nresponse of “Why would I want to read about people buying milk and other such\nnonsense?”\n\nFast-forward to today and I am a very active user of Twitter. Alan won this\none, but not by any conventional means.\n\nClearly knowing how stubborn I was being (who’d of thunk it, eh?), Alan\ndecided to secretly register a Twitter account in my name (_@jonobacon_) and\nstart tweeting, pretending to be me. Alan and his cohort, Dave Walker, trumped\nout tweets about me sleeping, thinking about community while in the shower,\n_communitizing the community with community tools_ , and other such high\njinks. I discovered their tomfoolery, was amused at their mutiny, yet demanded\nthe login credentials. Now I was stuck with a Twitter account, but I had no\nmilk to buy and no one to tell. Although I didn’t want it, I figured I might\nas well play with it. I am glad I did. It has been an invaluable tool both\nprofessionally and socially.\n\n# Don’t Be That Guy/Girl\n\nIn light of my conversion to Twitter use, some of you may be a little confused\nabout why I earlier referred to social media, the umbrella term for Twitter,\nFacebook, Google+, and other services, as being _completely overrated_. Let me\nexplain. You’d better sit down.\n\nWith the advent of social media, the tools that have surfaced as a result of\nthis more social approach to computing have certainly had an impact on the\nworld. Facebook, Twitter, and others have percolated into our lives in\ndifferent ways and opened up interesting opportunities. Social media has\nraised the visibility of many campaigns, from the media and movies to those\nresulting in significant political change in many countries.\n\nThey are, however, just _tools_. There are many useful tools in the world that\nhave become new and disruptive to our behavior, but few have been immersed in\nthe sheer amount of hype, nonsensical ramblings, and just pure, unfiltered,\nsalty bull that social media has.\n\nIn every industry there have always been _hangers-on_ : people who join an\nindustry and just want to be seen, respected, and included in their definition\nof the “cool-kids club.” Typically these people are riddled with insecurities\nabout what value they bring, so they try to accomplish value via association.\nThey try to get invited to the cool parties, attend the cool conferences, and\ntalk about and share articles about cool topics and buzzwords. Of course,\nlet’s not forget that _cool_ is entirely subjective in this context (often\nabout as cool as a blazing furnace). But you know what? It’s fine…these folks\nexist everywhere, and no harm, no foul.\n\nUnfortunately, social media has been a magnet for some of these hangers-on. In\nthe wake of this new technology, a generation of people have formed who bring\nlittle value other than getting into philosophical debates and theoretical\nhand waving about the who, why, and what of social media without bringing any\npractical application to those findings.\n\nNow, I get it. I am English, and some of us English folk can be a tad cynical\nat times. But friends, I have tried to resist taking a cynical view. Oh, I\nhave tried. I have engaged with some of these folks with the hope of\nunderstanding the importance of this philosophical layer of discussion, and to\nhear some substance and practical application of such discourse and ultimately\nbe proven wrong. I would love to be proven wrong. While there are definitely\npeople who have an interest, talent, and value in social media and who use it\nfor real, practical purposes, there is still far too little signal to the\nsheer amount of noisy, rambling, ethereal nonsense that clogs up the Internet.\n\nSocial media really is a _genuinely valuable tool_ , but it is _just a tool_.\nWhile social media has certainly opened up new opportunities for community and\nuser engagement, the tools are really not the interesting ingredient in the\nmixing bowl; what is really interesting is how the tools shine a spotlight on\nthe social values, needs, and opportunities that are implicit in humans. These\nsocial values have been around since humans started walking (or slithering,\ndepending on your view); the tools are just a means of bubbling these\nattributes to the surface.\n\nThere is a balance to be struck, though. Sure, the tools are just tools, but\nthe philosophy of what social media opens up for us is just philosophy, too.\nPhilosophical hand waving and tool obsession will not grow you a productive,\nfun, and empowered community; day-to-day application of these tools and an\nunderstanding of what lights our social fires will.\n\nI was debating with myself whether I should even share these views in the\nbook, but my responsibility throughout this book is to help you all become\nsuccessful community leaders and managers. Part of this goal involves sharing\nskills that you can use in your work, but part of it is seeing some of the\nsocial norms and dysfunctions that can form around the work of community\nleaders and managers. One of these social norms, particularly in the formative\nyears of the profession of community management, is that you will see some of\nthese folks with little practical substance who are more interested in playing\ndebate club than building real value in community. Don’t get dragged into\nthat; many of these folks do this to prove their abilities, knowledge, and\nintellect…but the real proof is not in the academia that can be cited; rather,\nit is in the community that you build.\n\nIn this chapter we are going to focus on the substance of how social media can\nhelp you grow and build your community.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> I’m not convinced that the current generation of social media sites have\n> helped communities to prosper in the way that earlier technologies like\n> mailing lists or even Usenet did.

This is a\nparticular challenge for a topic such as social media, as we need to talk\nabout specific tools to really understand how social media works. As such, we\nare going to talk about tools that are prevalent at the time of this writing\nin 2012, but if you are reading this in 2025 while commuting to work on your\njetpack, with your hoverboard under your arm, there are likely to be similar\nservices to which you can apply the same approaches.\n\nToday, in the disappointingly _lacking-in-jetpacks_ year of 2012, the\nfollowing social media networks are the most common:\n\n[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com)\n\n    \n\nA devilishly simple concept that has taken the world by storm, Twitter allows\npeople to register on the site and send messages of no more than 140\ncharacters in length. (The size limit comes about because Twitter was designed\nto be convenient for users of SMS text messaging, which had an arbitrary size\nlimit by design.) The site allows you to follow people, see their messages,\nand even republish the messages. The concept may seem strange to those of you\nwho have never used Twitter, but it has become an invaluable tool for\nconnecting to people and keeping up-to-date with what they are doing and their\ninterests.\n\n[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com)\n\n    \n\nAnother runaway success story, Facebook offers a place for people to provide\nupdates on what they are doing, post pictures, share their interests, and keep\nup-to-date with what is going on in their friends’ lives. Facebook also\nprovides tools for organizing events, creating campaigns, and more.\n\n[Google+](http://plus.google.com)\n\n    \n\nWhile still very new at the time of this writing, Google+ is gaining momentum\nand provides many similar features to Facebook but in an arguably nicer and\nmore refined way—the _same great social networking taste, just in a Google\ncan_. The major difference seems to be that Google+ is designed for sharing\namong a plethora of selected groups (“circles”) whereas Facebook is still more\ncommonly used for sharing one’s life with the world.\n\nEach of these tools can help us with three primary functions that we commonly\nhave in our communities. These are:\n\nBroadcasting\n\n    \n\nSocial media is useful for sharing events, developments, content, and other\nthings going on in our community. Well-crafted social media channels can\ncommunicate our news and ideas to a significant number of people. What’s key\nis not just the volume of content or the number of people who see it, but\ncommunicating _interesting_ content to the _right kinds of people_.\n\nFeedback\n\n    \n\nSocial media can be a tremendous tool for getting better feedback on what our\ncommunity members, users, customers, and other people think about us and our\ncommunity. Seeing and understanding our work and its effect is a key part of\nunderstanding how to do better, and social media can be hugely helpful here.\n\nCollaboration\n\n    \n\nSocial media can also be a useful tool for collaborating with others, planning\nevents and projects, and more. In addition, it is a useful means of\nencouraging others to participate in collaborative campaigns and efforts.\n\nLater in this chapter we are going to explore each of these areas and how you\ncan use social media in your communities with some solid examples. First,\nthough, let’s take a quick spin through each service and get started using\nthem.\n\n# Social Media Services in a Nutshell\n\nThere are a great many social media networks around the world, and many of\nthem are focused on specific countries and regions. Here we will take a look\nat some of the most recognizable social networks.\n\n## Twitter\n\nBack in 2006, a little-known podcasting company, Odeo, had a daylong meeting\nwith its board members. Jack Dorsey, one of the members, presented an\ninteresting idea he had been working on: a text message–oriented service for\nsharing messages between groups. Originally called _twttr_ , following the\ntrend of picking a word and removing vowels (which I bet frustrates the\nDutch), this is the service through which Dorsey published the first of what\nwould later be known as a _tweet_ in March 2006.\n\nShortly after the first prototype was working, the service was launched\npublicly. After some modest initial success, the service started to skyrocket\nin 2007 at the popular _South By Southwest_ festival; there the number of\ndaily tweets _tripled_. As Twitter awareness grew, celebrities joined it, as\nthey so often do, and Twitter became referenced commonly in magazines, on\ntelevision, and on websites. In June 2010, around 65 million tweets were being\nsent each day. To a cynic, that is a lot of pints of milk being talked about.\n\nLike many technologies, Twitter started out life as a technical curiosity with\nthose who were technically savvy enough to discover such curiosities, but has\nsince become a global phenomenon. Celebrities, politicians, business leaders,\ncommunity members, and many companies are using Twitter as a primary method of\ncommunicating with people. It is not a fad, either; these folks wouldn’t use\nit unless they saw real value in it.\n\nWith the so-called Web 2.0 revolution (when the Web became more interactive\nand dynamic) many start-ups and products tried to become ubiquitous, but\nTwitter didn’t only succeed at bringing a technology to the masses, it created\nan entirely new medium that is a common part of how many of us communicate\nonline. You don’t often see whole new mediums of communication being taken on\nby everyone and his dog.\n\nAs such, Twitter is a service you should definitely be using in your\ncommunity, even if you are the least technical, most online-adverse group.\nTwitter is a tremendous fishing net for you to attract community members, as\nwell as communicating to others things that are going on in your world.\n\nWhy Twitter is Interesting\n\nTwitter is interesting for a few reasons. First, it has become a truly\nubiquitous means of communicating with others. Its sheer popularity has become\na common reason to use the service, particularly if you want to raise the\nawareness of your community and get other people involved.\n\nTwitter is also a wonderful medium for encouraging the viral dissemination of\ninformation; that is, broadcasting news about your community and encouraging\nit to be shared again and again as the audience grows. This is largely due to\nthe ease of sharing tweets by _retweeting_ (Twitter users sharing their\nmessages with their own followers) and the ease and low friction involved in\nfollowing a user on Twitter.\n\n### Getting started with Twitter\n\nTo get started, we first need to understand how Twitter works. Let me explain,\nusing myself as an example.\n\nThrough the unusual path I explained earlier, I have an account with Twitter\nunder the username _@jonobacon_ (all Twitter accounts have an “@” at the\nbeginning). Using Twitter, I can post messages that are no more than 140\ncharacters long (called _tweets_) to the website. The website tells me how\nmany characters I have left as I type, so I don’t have do any counting on my\nown. As an example, I could write:\n\n> Been a long week this week, I am ready for the weekend and ready to relax!\n\nEach message that a Twitter users posts appears on his Twitter feed page,\nwhich is at _http://www.twitter.com/__< username>_. As an example, my Twitter\nfeed is at _http://www.twitter.com/jonobacon_.\n\nPeople who have an account on Twitter and who visit my page can click the\nFollow button there, after which all of my tweets will appear in their\n_timeline_. The timeline is a chronological list of tweets from everyone you\nfollow. As an example, here are the three most recent tweets on my timeline:\n\n> @Anthrax (Anthrax (Band)) SOLD OUT Anthrax show and Metal Master’s Clinic\n> this Monday, Sept. 12! Watch the entire show LIVE on... fb.me/GcVvxr5B 1\n> minute ago\n>\n> @CNN (Breaking News) cnnbrk CNN Breaking News Protesters in Egypt breach\n> wall, enter Israeli Embassy on.cnn.com/r1ZCC8 3 minutes ago\n>\n> @sil Getting locked out of my house sucks. It particularly sucks at 4am. 4\n> minutes ago\n\nHere you can see that I am following the metal band Anthrax, the CNN news\nservice, and a frustrated call for help from a friend. You may have also\nnoticed that there are some short web links in there (_fb.me/GcVvxr5B_ and\n_on.cnn.com/r1ZCC8_); many people use Twitter to share interesting links to\ndifferent websites and content online.\n\nImportantly, many people don’t actually use the main Twitter site to send\ntheir tweets, but install a program that helps them manage their tweets from\ntheir desktop computer, tablet, or cell phone. There is also Twitter support\nbuilt into many websites that makes it easier to share interesting links and\ncontent on Twitter. We will discuss these tools in more detail later in this\nchapter.\n\nThe first step you should take when signing up for Twitter is to find\ninteresting Twitter feeds and follow them, so they will appear in your\ntimeline and you can start to get used to the culture and style of tweets.\n\nWhen you see an interesting tweet and feel a burning urge to tell the person\nwho posted it what you think about the tweet or something related to it, you\ncan _reply_ to it. To do this, click the Reply link next to the tweet and type\nin a message (again, no longer than 140 characters). That message will be sent\ndirectly, but still publicly, to the person who wrote the original tweet.\nInside everyone’s Twitter account is a link called Mentions that will show you\nall of the tweets that highlight your username (e.g., _@jonobacon_ for me).\nYou can also send someone a message by just mentioning her username somewhere\nin the tweet. For example:\n\n> Looking forward to seeing @Anthrax this weekend playing live in San\n> Francisco.\n\nThis will make my tweet appear in Anthrax’s list of Mentions.\n\nThis reply feature is one of the coolest features of Twitter. It means you can\nfollow your friends and your favorite celebrities and send a message that they\nwill likely see. Do bear in mind, though, that as people get more followers,\nthey also typically get more replies, and for celebrities with millions of\nfollowers your reply may get lost with a thousand other replies. So you can\ntell Tom Cruise how much you love him, but he might not see it.\n\nAnother useful feature in Twitter is _retweeting_. Each tweet from people you\nfollow in your timeline will have a Retweet link next to it. Clicking this\nwill send that tweet to your followers via your account. This is a great way\nto share interesting tweets that others may not have seen.\n\nThere are, of course, many other features included in Twitter, such as lists,\nphoto sharing, and so on, but here we are covering the key features that are\nuseful for our communities. If you want to find out more, be sure to check out\n_[The Twitter Book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022336.do)_ by Tim\nO’Reilly and Sarah Milstein (O’Reilly).\n\n### Note\n\nOne notable alternative to Twitter (under the general category known as\n_microblogging_) exists: identi.ca. It works a lot like Twitter, but its main\nselling point is that it is open source code and encourages other companies to\nset up other sites running the same software. Identi.ca is popular among\nproponents of Free Software and open culture. As a start to its goal of open\ndata sharing, it lets you set up an automatic feed so that your postings to\nidenti.ca get reposted immediately to Twitter.\n\n## Facebook\n\nBack in October 2003, a young Mark Zuckerberg, who is now known as the baby-\nfaced founder of Facebook, wrote Facemash while at Harvard University.\nAlthough the site was initially a hot-or-not type of voting site where you\ncould rate things as being _hot_ or _not_ , Zuckerberg expanded it and created\na social study tool for his art history project. With it he would upload\nphotos and provide a means for his classmates to leave comments on the photos.\nZuckerberg then started thinking a lot about how social experiences could work\nwith technology, and created a first cut of these ideas called\nthefacebook.com.\n\nWhile thefacebook.com was initially limited to Harvard students, it soon\nexpanded to MIT, Columbia, Boston University, New York University, Stanford,\nand Yale. As the site grew in popularity, it was expanded to a high school\nversion and then eventually was opened up to everyone over the age of 13 in\n2006.\n\nIn 2008 Facebook was rocking out with around 100 million active users, but\nthat grew to 750 million active users by mid-2011. Subsequently, Facebook has\ncontinued to be a huge success and has developed intense ubiquity as a place\nwhere most people can find their friends, interact with them, see status\nupdates, share photos and videos, organize events, and more.\n\nFacebook has also become popular for various campaigns and awareness groups to\nget involved. Facebook has often been used as a vehicle for showing support\nfor, or outrage toward, a particular perspective. Politically it was used by\nadvocates of same-sex marriage to rally support for marriage equality around\nthe time Proposition 8 in California was in the news. Facebook was used in a\nmore comedic setting with the “Can this pickle get more fans than Nickleback”\npage. The pickle won (I would have hated to be Nickleback’s manager, breaking\nthat news to the band). There are countless other examples of where Facebook\nwas used as a central tool to unite opinion or even coordinate events.\n\nWhy Facebook is Interesting\n\nFacebook provides a number of interesting features for communities. First, it\nis a great networking tool for meeting other people, and meeting their friends\nby association. This will expand your personal network and provide a useful\nmeans to meet other people who could be interested in being part of your\ncommunity.\n\nFacebook also provides useful community growth features such as Pages, Events,\nand Groups. Pages are particularly useful for representing your community\nonline and Groups can be an effective communication tool for communities.\nEvents are a useful and simple means to provide exposure for your community\nevents.\n\n### Getting started with Facebook\n\nCompared to Twitter, Facebook is a far more comprehensive platform and has a\nlot more functionality built into it. Here we are going to cover some of the\nbasics, and there is plenty of help and documentation online for you to\ndiscover the rest. First, though, you should head over to\n_http://www.facebook.com_ and register.\n\nOn Facebook, every user has a _Profile_ , which is basically a web page that\ndescribes you. This can include things such as:\n\nEmployment\n\n    \n\nPlaces you have worked and where you work right now. When you add a company,\nyou can often click on the company name to see other folks who work there,\ntoo.\n\nBeliefs\n\n    \n\nYour political and religious viewpoints.\n\nPlaces\n\n    \n\nPlaces you have lived and where you live now.\n\nRelationships\n\n    \n\nOther people on Facebook whom you would characterize as your\nspouse/girlfriend/boyfriend, or your family members.\n\nPhotos/videos\n\n    \n\nPictures and videos that you want to share with others. You can say who is in\nthese photos/videos through a feature called _tagging_. When someone is tagged\nin a photo/video, the photo/video appears in that person’s own list of\nphotos/videos on his profile page.\n\nA key part of your Facebook Profile is your _Wall_ ; this is a place where you\ncan post messages about what you are doing. Interestingly, other people can\npost replies to your messages, and they can post their own messages on your\nWall, too. This makes Facebook a lot more social and interesting than some of\nthe other social networking offerings.\n\nWith your Facebook Profile all set you can now find and add friends. When you\nadd friends you can see their updates and activity on your _Facebook Home_ ,\nwhich is a rolling list of updates. Let’s say, for example, that your old\nschoolfriend Adam Hoffert is on Facebook. You can search for him using the\nSearch box, and when you find him you can add him as a friend. If he accepts\nyour friend request he will see updates from your Facebook Home and vice\nversa. You can then look at his friend list and see if it contains people you\nknow, and then invite them to be friends with you; this is a great way to keep\nin touch with folks.\n\nWhile most Facebook users primarily just set up and use their own profile to\nshare updates and interact with their friends, Facebook does have some other\nuseful features:\n\nEvents\n\n    \n\nAlerting people and inviting them to events is simple and effective on\nFacebook. You can create the event, specify the location, date, and\ndescription, and then invite people to the event. Everyone who is invited gets\na Facebook message and can specify whether she is coming, maybe coming, or not\nplanning to attend. Facebook Events are a useful tool for organizing community\nevents and getting a rough idea of attendance.\n\nPages\n\n    \n\nFacebook Pages allow you to create a profile page for something (e.g., your\ncommunity, product, etc.). With each page you can post information, pictures,\nvideos, and more, and people can mark themselves as _liking_ the page. When\nthey like a page, status updates sent to the page will appear in the Facebook\nHome timeline. Pages are similar to groups but are far more viral; I highly\nrecommend that you set one up for your community.\n\nGroups\n\n    \n\nGroups provide a means for creating a place for people to join the group and\ninteract with other group members. A Group functions basically like a shared\nWall and provides a place for adding group-related content. Groups are useful\nif you want to build a small community whose members can keep in touch.\n\nApplications\n\n    \n\nFacebook also supports a wide range of custom applications, and you have\nprobably seen all the games and other apps that are available there. The\nFacebook app system is pretty flexible, so if you want to create a highly\ncustomized application for your community, this could be another option.\n\nEach of these features can be useful in different community building\ncampaigns. We will discuss this in more detail later.\n\n## Google+\n\nA later player to the game, Google+ was launched in June 2011 as Google’s\noffering in the increasingly popular and competitive social networking space.\nThanks to the huge success of Twitter and Facebook, Google was no stranger to\ncompeting with them. Google had tried to claim the social networking crown\npreviously with its failed Google Wave and Google Buzz efforts, and at its\nlaunch you could not help but feel that Google+ was going to be Google’s final\nstab at the social networking crown jewels.\n\nThe site provides a service that is somewhat similar to Facebook: Profile with\na means to group friends in different ways, post photos and videos, and see\none another’s status updates. Many initial reviews called Google+ a “slightly\nmore pleasant-to-use Facebook.” Where Google+ did get very favorable reviews\nwas in its _Hangouts_ video conferencing functionality, which has had very\npositive praise and active use.\n\nGoogle has an uphill climb, though. With Facebook sporting so many profiles\nfrom a wide variety of demographics, many potential users were uninterested in\nGoogle+ because their friends were already on Facebook. Early adopters and\ntech enthusiasts naturally flocked to Google+ right away, and fortunately for\nGoogle the growth continued. Within a month, membership had reached 10\nmillion. At the time of this writing, it is too early to tell whether Google’s\ninvestment will ultimately pay off and unseat the Facebook king.\n\nWhy Google+ is Interesting\n\nGoogle+ provides another social network in which to share and broadcast\ninformation about your community, and a means for people to potentially join\nyour community. Today, Google+ is primarily useful as another avenue of growth\nin addition to Twitter and Facebook.\n\nIn my mind, currently the most useful feature in Google+ for community\nbuilding is its excellent _Hangouts_ capability; this is an invaluable tool\nfor community meetings and conflict/dispute resolution sessions.\n\n### Getting started with Google+\n\nGoogle+ works in a similar way to Facebook; you can register a profile and add\ninformation about yourself, add photos, and more. Unlike Facebook, though, in\nwhich you have one big friend list, Google+ lets you group your friends in\nlogical buckets.\n\nGoogle+ uses the concept of a _circle_ , which is a group of friends with a\ndescription. As an example, I have a circle for my team at work, a circle for\nmy management team, one for my closest friends, one for Ubuntu users, and\nothers. Although users can see your friends, they can’t see which circles they\nare in, and this feature provides a nice means of grouping together friends in\na way that will not offend anyone. Circles are also useful for gathering\ngroups together for hangouts and other discussions.\n\nPossibly the most innovative and useful feature in Google+ is Hangouts. A\nHangout is an audio and video chat feature that lets you chat with either a\nperson or a group of people. Unlike other videoconferencing tools, the Hangout\nfeature feels particularly well designed. When you join a hangout, you see the\nother people’s webcams in a row, and when someone talks, a larger video view\nshows that person speaking. This provides a particularly immersive and\ninteractive experience. I use a hangout for my team meetings (which includes\nparticipants from the US, Germany, Spain, and Egypt) and my meetings now feel\nfar more realistic and “in person” than they did before.\n\nGoogle+ also includes some other features, such as _Huddles_ (instant\nmessaging within circles) and _Sparks_ (a means of sharing search topics with\nothers), but it currently lacks many of the features in Facebook (although\nthese may be present by the time you read this).\n\nGoogle+ Pages\n\nGoogle+ also includes a feature similar to Facebook Pages that allows you to\ncreate profiles about a product, community, topic, or otherwise and post\ncontent there. I recommend that your community has representation across both\nFacebook and Google Pages.\n\n# Harnessing Social Media\n\nWith a better idea of the social networking services available to us and the\nbasics down in terms of how they work, let’s now start talking about how you\ncan harness these services for your community. To start, I want to share a few\nlessons that I have learned about when and how you use your social media\nresources. Remember, this is _social_ , and as such we want to avoid making\nsome social faux pas, which is definitely possible.\n\nOne particular social faux pas is not distinguishing enough between your work\nand social habits and where the lines are drawn. Let me share a little story\nabout this.\n\nI have always done things in my spare time outside of work. In 2010 I was\nkicking off the Severed Fifth music project, had formed a band, and wanted to\nsee how we could influence the music industry around openness and Free\nCulture. I got Severed Fifth onto Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation,\nand others, and I became a content producing machine. I was writing blog\nentries every day with the tiniest of updates and sharing these updates across\nthe social networks.\n\nWhile excited about Severed Fifth, I was also keen to ensure that this work\ndid not eat into my day job. So I would never do any Severed Fifth work or\npost on the Severed Fifth social network accounts until I had finished work at\n7 p.m. At 7 p.m. all bets were off, and I would blast content left, right, and\ncenter.\n\nA few months later I was at a work event and heard from a colleague that a few\ncommunity members were concerned that I was working on Severed Fifth content\nduring the day when I should have been working in the Ubuntu community. I knew\nthat I wasn’t and I defended my honor vigorously. But then the reality set in.\n\nHow were folks supposed to know I was off the clock?\n\nFirst, how would they know what time I finish work (many were unclear which\ntime zone I was in, too), and would they really notice the timestamp and date\nof the messages I sent out on the social networks? I soon realized that the\nsocial media world doesn’t really have a concept of _off the clock_ ; it is\ntoo easy to confuse when you are working with when you are not.\n\nThe moral of this story is that as a community leader and manager, and\nparticularly if you work for a company that employs you to work with\ncommunity, you should ensure that your community has the right impression\nabout when you are and are not working. Although it may seem like a small\ndetail, the community misinterpreting when you are and are not working can\naffect your credibility in the community.\n\nA useful technique for avoiding this confusion is to write a blog post or\narticle about the topic, get it out on the table, and explain when you will be\nworking and when you are indulging in spare-time hobbies.\n\n### Note\n\nDon’t use your community social media resources for unrelated content. For\nexample, if you are the community leader for the FooBar community and you use\nthe FooBar Twitter and Facebook accounts to talk about your newfound interest\nin DIY, you are going to frustrate a lot of your community members. Never\nabuse community social media networks to bring attention to yourself.\n\nRemember, social networks are filled with different types of people from\ndifferent cultures and with different opinions. When you start working with\nsocial media, you will find yourself dashing off messages quickly at a\nheartbeat’s notice, and sometimes a throwaway tweet or message can embody a\ntone that you didn’t intend and give your community members the wrong idea.\n\nIn [Being Social](ch06.html#being_social \"Being Social\") we discussed the\nthree primary areas in which social media can be useful: broadcasting,\nfeedback, and collaboration. Let’s take a look at each of these now.\n\n## Broadcasting\n\nSocial media is a hugely useful tool for sharing and broadcasting information\nabout your community. Through social media networks, you have the ability not\nonly to inform and update your existing community about things that are going\non, but also to attract and interest entirely new community members. Social\nmedia also makes it devilishly simple for people to share your news across\ntheir social networks, thus continuing to expand your reach.\n\nFor you to effectively broadcast things using social media, you are going to\nneed interesting things to broadcast. This may seem obvious, but it is all too\noften forgotten. That doesn’t mean you need to limit yourself to broadcasting\ngroundbreaking news. Quite the opposite: small details and updates can be\nwonderfully interesting and provide juicy nuggets that your community and\nonlookers want to read about.\n\nHere are a few prime pieces of social media meat that you may want to consider\nsharing:\n\nNews\n\n    \n\nYour community will thirst after every drop of news they can find. Be sure to\nhave a blog, post plenty of news to it, and share links to the news across\nyour social networks.\n\nProgress updates\n\n    \n\nIf your community is building something (such as a piece of software, a\nproduct, or a service) be sure to share plenty of updates about what new\nfeatures you are bringing to it. Visual things such as photos, screenshots,\nand videos are always very popular.\n\nEvents\n\n    \n\nBe sure to broadcast not only community events, but also the details of how\nthese events are coming together (e.g., the call for papers, the final\nschedule, the attendee lists, etc.).\n\nMeetings\n\n    \n\nWhether you have online or face-to-face meetings, share announcements about\nthem so that people know to attend. Also broadcast the meeting notes/summary.\n\nAccomplishments\n\n    \n\nIf your community enjoys some achievement (X number of users/downloads, press\nreviews, testimonials, etc.), be sure to share it.\n\nStatements\n\n    \n\nIf you need to make a formal statement (e.g., in response to criticism), be\nsure to broadcast the statement or a link to a web page containing the\nstatement.\n\nKudos\n\n    \n\nIt is nice to specifically highlight people or groups in your community for\ntheir good work and to broadcast a short message celebrating their work. Kudos\ngoes a long way toward building goodwill.\n\nEach of these types of information is an ideal candidate for broadcasting\noutward and is something your community is likely to be interested in. Many of\nthe topics you share across your social networks will point to content that\nexists somewhere else. As an example, you may have a blog for your community\nwith official news and updates, and share messages on your social networks\nwith a link to each blog entry. Another example could be videos that you\nproduce and post to YouTube, or press articles that refer to your community.\n\nMessages that reference these blog posts, videos, articles, and so on are\ntypically a lot more popular than simple thoughts and opinions shared via your\nsocial networks. I strongly encourage you to produce and reference plenty of\nthis more substantial content. To provide content reflecting what’s important\nto you, you may want to look into creating resources such as a blog, video\nfeed, or other resources if they don’t exist already.\n\nTwitter is an ideal service for this kind of broadcasting. It is useful for a\nnumber of reasons:\n\nUbiquitous\n\n    \n\nTwitter is hugely popular. It is almost expected that most communities,\ncompanies, and people have Twitter accounts that can be followed by users. You\nshould definitely make the most of this ubiquity and get as many eyeballs on\nyour content as possible.\n\nFlowing\n\n    \n\nOne of the reasons why Twitter is so popular is that it transiently fits into\nour lives; we can easily dip in and out of Twitter and it doesn’t have to be a\nhuge time sink. Twitter provides a means of keeping up with what is going on\nin a low-bandwidth way throughout your day.\n\nEasy to follow\n\n    \n\nThe perfect tweet is one that will encourage the reader to follow you on\nTwitter and thus see all your future tweets in his timeline. Fortunately,\nTwitter makes following your content stream as easy as a single click. This\nsimplicity means that it is not uncommon for users to follow many feeds, yours\nbeing one of them. The more followers you have, the more eyeballs will see\nyour content.\n\nInsanely shareable\n\n    \n\nAnother wonderful benefit of Twitter is how easy it makes it to share updates.\nIf one of your followers sees a tweet she likes, she can share it with all her\nfollowers with a single click. This not only disseminates your content to even\nmore people, but also improves the likelihood of them following you. Sometimes\na single retweet from someone with a large number of followers can bring you a\nhuge number of new followers, who then see all your new messages.\n\nResponsive\n\n    \n\nTwitter feeds are conversations: people can respond and reply to your tweets\nand offer their feedback and opinion. This is useful for expanding your own\nworldview, hearing new ideas, and responding to critiques. It is also useful\nif you want to use Twitter to ask for feedback or opinion; people are often\nvery responsive.\n\nTo get started, register a Twitter account for your community. You can\nregister multiple accounts if you want (such as a personal account and\ncommunity accounts). Set your profile picture to your community logo, and add\ndetails about the community in the description. You can also add a web link to\nyour community’s home page, pointing to the Twitter feed. Configure a theme on\nyour Twitter page to match the look and feel of your community: Twitter offers\na lot of flexibility for colors, the background image, and more.\n\n### Getting more eyeballs\n\nWith your account set up, start posting the types of information and topics\ndiscussed in the previous section. I recommend that you strive to send out at\nleast one interesting piece of news each day, preferably more. Our core goal\nwith a new Twitter account is to distribute plenty of content and focus on\nincreasing the number of followers. Regularity of content is what is going to\nencourage people to follow you, so keep it coming, and keep the tone and\ngrammar professional.\n\nIt won’t be long before someone will send a reply to one of your tweets.\nAnother effective way to encourage people to follow you, and particularly to\nretweet your messages, is to be responsive to their replies. When someone\nreplies, send a response as soon as possible and again be polite and\nrespectful. Some replies you get may be positive and motivational, and you can\nreply to those with thanks and encouragement. Some may be critical or even\ndisrespectful, and you should reply to those with poise and clarifications (or\napologies where required).\n\nAnother useful tool for getting more eyes on your tweets is to use _hashtags_.\nA hashtag is any word or phrase you add to a tweet that starts with a hash\nsymbol (#). As an example, here is a tweet from me with a hashtag:\n\n> @jonobacon Be sure to check out The Art of Community! #community\n\nThe #community part of that message is a little like a category that you make\nup on the spot for you to put your tweet in. When people read the tweets on\nyour timeline, they can click on the hashtag and see all tweets (not just\nyours) that use the same hashtag. Because Twitter messages must be short,\npeople get used to even more compressed uses of tags:\n\n> @jonobacon Be sure to check out The Art of #community\n\nThe primary benefit of using hashtags is that when a given hashtag becomes\npopular, it opens up your tweets to many more eyes from people looking at that\nparticular search term. People who don’t know who _@jonobacon_ is may be\ninterested in communities and may search for the #community hashtag.\n\nTwitter also has a pointer to _trending topics_ , which are essentially hugely\npopular hashtags. If your tweet fits into one of those topics (don’t spam the\ntrending topics, though), it can put thousands or even millions of eyeballs on\nit. Mind you, when a topic is trending, your tweet will appear on that search\nterm’s timeline for only a minute or so before being knocked off by 50 other\ntweets with that hashtag from the same minute.\n\n### Note\n\nAt the time of this writing, other social networks such as Facebook and\nGoogle+ don’t provide support for Twitter hashtags; it is a Twitter-specific\nfeature.\n\nWhile my discussion of broadcasting has focused on Twitter, other sites such\nas Facebook and Google+ support similar features for sharing messages on their\nrespective profiles. While those are useful, Twitter has thus far been the\nmost effective medium for raising the sheer number of eyeballs on your\ncontent. It is recommended, though, that you cross-post to multiple social\nnetworks, and we discuss this later in this chapter.\n\n### Tuning up your messages\n\nAlthough all social networks place a limit on the size of each message,\nTwitter imposes the most conservative limit: 140 characters for each tweet.\nWhile you can certainly stretch your metaphorical legs out on Facebook and\nGoogle+ and share longer messages, the 140-character limit is actually a\nrather nice discipline to get used to. As such, I recommend that you take some\ntime getting used to writing short, cohesive, professional messages.\n\n### Note\n\nThe famous 140-character limit assumes that characters are the standard ones\nthat appear on an English language keyboard. Many languages have characters\nthat take up more space, so each tweet is limited to fewer characters.\n\nWriting these short messages, complete with the links and hashtags that you\nmay want to include, can be tough. It definitely takes a little bit of\npractice. Some folks go so far as to use txtspeak to shorten messages (e.g.,\n“chk out my gr8 new articl on my wbsite”), and although it is efficient, it\nmakes you come across like a gangly, angsty 14-year-old. Always strive to\nensure that your tone is professional, and not that you live with your mom and\nplay Pokemon alone at night.\n\nThere is a useful trick you can use to provide a link to a web address in your\nmessage. Although Twitter also provides this service built in, a range of\nlink-shortening services take a long web address and generate a shorter\naddress for use in your social media messages. As an example, the\n[bit.ly](http://www.bit.ly) service will take an address such as this blog\npost from my blog:\n\n> http://www.jonobacon.org/2011/09/13/community-management-crib-notes-\n> conflict-resolution/\n\nand convert it to:\n\n> bit.ly/nN97va\n\nIf the user clicks on _bit.ly/nN97va_ , it will link to\n_http://www.jonobacon.org/2011/09/13/community-management-crib-notes-conflict-\nresolution/_. Your user will still see the same content, but the link won’t\neat up your tweet. A nice feature of bit.ly is the ability to see metrics\nabout how many people accessed and shared the link.\n\n### Avoiding social media overkill\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, when I formed the Severed Fifth project, I became\nsomething of a social media maniac. I registered accounts across almost all of\nthe different social media networks and posted a lot of content. In my earlier\nstory highlighting _when_ you should post, I didn’t discuss just _how much_\nyou should post.\n\nSurely this should be simple; I mentioned earlier how you should post a lot of\ncontent and post it regularly, so we should post as much as we can, right?\n\nWell, _kind of_.\n\nAlthough getting a community up and running always requires a certain amount\nof momentum, there is definitely a risk of _social media overkill_.\nUnfortunately, I fell into this trap with Severed Fifth.\n\nWhen I kicked off the project, not only did I post four or five pieces of\ncontent in a day, but I had also connected my social media services together\n(more on this later) to ensure that the same message went out to all the\nnetworks. The result of a lot of content cascading across a lot of networks\nwas a bombardment of Severed Fifth information, in epic proportions. While it\ndemonstrated the sheer level of activity going in the Severed Fifth camp, it\nended up weakening my messaging to some extent because some folks switched it\noff due to the sheer quantity of material.\n\nThis was communicated to me when I went to an event and a number of people\njoked about the Severed Fifth Propaganda Machine being dialed up to 11. While\nthey were kidding, I could tell that there was an underlying nugget of\nfrustration buried in the humor. The attitude was news to me, but it was an\nimportant lesson; social media is a means to an end, and the means was\nimpacting the effectiveness of the end.\n\nGetting this balance right is difficult. While you should keep the momentum\nmoving with enough content, sometimes a _less is more_ restraint is most\nappropriate.\n\norm:swap-title: Key Points About Broadcasting\n\n  * Post good content regularly, particularly in the beginning when you want to get your follower count up.\n\n  * Proofread your messages.\n\n  * Use web address shortening services to squeeze as much text out of your messages as possible.\n\n  * Use hashtags to get more exposure to your messages.\n\n  * Don’t overdo it and bombard people with content; too much can have the same effect as too little: people will stop following you.\n\n  * Be careful not to accidentally send out a tweet publicly if it was intended for just one person, or accidentally send an SMS from your phone to Twitter (it has been done in the past with often hilarious yet disastrous results).\n\n## Feedback\n\nHaving great visibility and the ability to take the temperature of your\ncommunity is critically important. As we discuss elsewhere in the book, you\ncan track many different types of metrics to give you insights into specific\nprojects, campaigns, and efforts, but getting a feel for the general\nperception of the community can be difficult. There is no single method or\napproach that can provide this insight; you instead need to pull from a\nvariety of sources and develop a picture from this data.\n\nSocial media can help present a useful set of sources for providing this\ninsight. Social media environments are filled with everyday people, different\nperspectives, different expectations, and radically varying viewpoints. Social\nmedia is likely to be filled with the very people your community touches or\ncould touch. These melting pots of opinion and viewpoints are great places to\nobserve feedback and reactions to your community.\n\nIn April 2011 we released a controversial new version of Ubuntu: Ubuntu 11.04.\nThe reason for the controversy was that the desktop edition of Ubuntu was\nshipping an entirely new user interface that had been created and led by\nCanonical (my employer). Without boring you with the details, the controversy\nwas largely born out of the view that this new user interface, known as Unity,\nwas not ready for prime time and that it was inappropriate to replace the\nprevious solution, known as GNOME, with this young upstart.\n\nOpinion was deeply divided in the buildup to the release, and the debates were\nemotionally charged and passionate. On release day (Thursday, April 28, 2011)\nI was bracing myself for the response. My view was simple: I was fine with\ncritiques and with people not liking the release, but I just wanted folks to\ngive it a try and see what they thought for themselves, instead of reading a\nblogger’s regurgitated bias (whether positive or negative). It was never more\nimportant in my career for me to have my finger on the pulse of public\nopinion.\n\nI tracked a variety of different sources to see this opinion; Ubuntu blogs,\npress articles, discussion forums, responses to me via email, and more. For\nmost of these resources I had to wait as journalists needed to download the\nnew release (which went slowly because _everyone_ was downloading it at the\nsame time). There I sat with all of these different sites open in my browser,\nrabidly refreshing to see the perspective and opinion.\n\nWhile I was waiting for the journalists and bloggers to do their thing, the\nsocial networks were already ablaze. Instead of waiting and writing one big\nreview, the social media users were commenting on every step of their Ubuntu\n11.04 experience in _real time_.\n\nTheir feedback started right at the beginning of the chain, with comments\nabout how to find the Ubuntu 11.04 software to download, how the site looked,\nand the download speed, and then moving on to running the installer,\ncommenting on the different elements of the installation process, and booting\nthe system and taking it for a spin, tweeting every step of the way. It was\nfascinating, and I sat there drinking coffee after coffee late into the night,\nglued to the screen, watching this controversial product of six months of hard\nwork being consumed and experienced before my very eyes.\n\nThis real-time feedback was invaluable to see. It gave me a new set of\nperspectives on the Ubuntu experience, perspectives that I shared with my\ncolleagues to help us improve our community and product. Social media is a\nuseful tool for not only this blow-by-blow accounting, but also general\nfeedback, perspectives, and viewpoints among those in your community and the\npolicies, processes, output, and approaches your community encompasses.\n\n### Where to look\n\nThe current social media networks provide a useful range of resources you can\nemploy to get a better feel for what is going on in your community.\n\nLet’s start with Twitter. A natural way in which you can take the initial\npulse of public opinion is by looking at the reaction from the folks you\nfollow and the replies they send you regarding topics of discussion in your\ncommunity. While this will provide a limited set of data, primarily from\npeople you know, it can get you off on the right foot in terms of gathering an\nidea of what people think.\n\nAn invaluable data gathering tool in Twitter, though, is its Search function.\nWith it you can search for anything on Twitter and see real-time results as\nthose searches are updated. As an example, if you type “The Art of Community”\ninto the Twitter Search box while I am writing a tweet that includes those\nwords, you will see that tweet almost immediately after I send it. There are\nalso a host of other services online for analyzing Twitter searches,\nstatistics, and more.\n\nThere are two distinct uses for Twitter searches:\n\nContext-specific search\n\n    \n\nIf the context, and particularly the real-time nature, of an incident is\nimportant (such as seeing opinion from attendees watching a presentation), it\ncan be useful to conduct a real-time search for a particular term. For many of\nthese incidents, organizers choose a hashtag and people share their views\nusing the same hashtag so that they can easily see one another’s results.\n\nGeneral searches of interest\n\n    \n\nInside Twitter you can set up and save searches. It is useful to set up a\nsearch for terms that are of general interest to you, and that you will take a\nlook at each day. As an example, I have searches set up for “The Art of\nCommunity”, “#artofcommunity”, “Ubuntu”, “community”, and “Jono Bacon“. Each\nday I take a quick spin through these searches to get an idea of what people\nare tweeting about that is related to the work I am doing.\n\nWhile the context-specific search is useful for keeping an eye on individual\nincidents or topics, the repeated general search is typically very useful for\nfollowing topics important to you. This approach helps provide not only\nvisibility onto the Twittersphere, but also an opportunity to reply to\ncomments and inaccuracies where they occur, especially if they take place\noutside your immediate group of associates, friends, and followers.\n\nFacebook also provides a useful search feature that will show all Facebook\ncomments or posts that contain a given term (especially if that term has a\npage on Facebook). As an example, there is an Ubuntu page on Facebook, and if\nI search for that term, it will show the Ubuntu page and another option for\nseeing references to Ubuntu throughout Facebook. Unfortunately, at the time of\nthis writing it is a little confusing to differentiate between the page and\nthe search results.\n\n### Note\n\nAnother useful data point is to look at which tweets get retweeted and which\nmessages are liked on Facebook and Google+. This can provide some insight into\npopular topics or decisions.\n\n### Debates\n\nBack in early 2010 a debate was raging in the Ubuntu community. The Unity\nteam, who I mentioned earlier, had made the design decision to move the window\nbuttons (icons that close, minimize, and maximize windows) from the righthand\nside of the window border to the lefthand side.\n\nNow, many of you may not see the big deal with this change, but some members\nof the community were incensed. In fact, a storm of Chuck Norris–like strength\nkicked into play. While I certainly don’t wish to denigrate the views of those\nwho believed this was a genuine usability regression, much of the carping\nonline seemed to spring from a fear of change. There was some wonderfully\nreasoned, well-communicated, and evidence-driven discussion, alongside a\npretty hefty chunk of argumentative, thoughtless rhetoric.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, my view about these kinds of discussions has always\nbeen simple. I like to encourage a culture and environment of different ideas\nand opinions, and the polite exchange of those ideas and opinions, and I never\nset out to persuade people to change their perspectives. I do, though, strive\nto correct and debunk misinformation, presumptions, and in some rare cases,\noutright lies about the work we do. As such, I always look for where the\ndebates are happening in public so that I can participate and bring some\nclarity when misinformation or misrepresentation would occur.\n\nSocial media was a key tool in helping me to see these debates. In many cases\nI would often be referenced in a debate (e.g., “Not sure about that, you\nshould check with @jonobacon to see what he thinks”), but in some situations I\nwould see fragments of the debate occurring in my own Twitter timeline or in\none of my searches.\n\nWith this visibility, I could then get involved in the debate and discussion.\nThis was useful not only for ensuring that we reduced misinformation, but also\nfor learning about new perspectives, feedback, concerns, and positive\nreinforcement from different members of the community who had shared their\nviews.\n\n### Asking for feedback\n\nEverything we have discussed so far in this section has concerned learning\nabout discussions and feedback that are already occurring, often with people\nwhom you don’t know or are not within your immediate sphere of influence.\n\nSometimes, being more up-front and frank is a useful way to get your questions\nanswered. As an example, if you are curious to see what your community (or the\nwider community of onlookers and enthusiasts) thinks about a particular topic,\nit can often be useful to just ask them on your social networks (or using a\nparticular Twitter hashtag) and see how they respond. Asking such questions\ncan often result in your community having a very positive impression of you\nbecause your openness and willingness to seek feedback from the community\ntells them you care about them as a community manager and leader.\n\nBefore asking for feedback, though, make sure you have a way in which you can\nsee the responses. For Facebook and Google+ this is simple: each message you\npost also has a commenting feature for people to leave their responses neatly\nconnected to your message. For Twitter, though, you should either explicitly\nask people to direct their feedback to you, or even better, use a hashtag. The\nbenefit of a hashtag is that everyone can see the responses, not just you.\n\norm:swap-title: Key Points About Feedback\n\n  * Set up a series of search feeds in the different social media networks to keep an eye on what is happening.\n\n  * Always encourage the use of hashtags to improve visibility of discussions.\n\n  * Pick standard hashtags for certain topics (e.g., a specific hashtag for an event).\n\n  * Seeing the messages is only part of the challenge; look for the patterns and commonalities buried in the messages and the trends that form.\n\n  * Don’t just look at social media; augment it with news feeds, blogs, and other mediums.\n\n  * Be careful to not accidentally send out a tweet publicly if it was intended for just one person, or accidentally send an SMS from your phone to Twitter.\n\n## Collaboration\n\nIn March 2011 I had a _brainwave_. Shocking, I know.\n\nBack then, my wife, Erica, was about to turn 30 and I wanted to do something\nspecial for her. Using a combination of guile and cunning I organized a\nsurprise party for her at our house. The party, while fun, is not the\ninteresting point of this story; social media is what makes this relevant.\n\nPutting together the party was more challenging than you would think. I needed\nto do a number of things:\n\n  * Invite a bunch of our friends to the party.\n\n  * Invite people who are friends with Erica but for whom I didn’t have contact details.\n\n  * Get an idea of who was coming and who couldn’t make it.\n\n  * Coordinate with others about who wanted to bring food, who was bringing booze, who wanted to help put up decorations, and other elements.\n\n  * Provide a means for attendees to communicate with one another so that they could coordinate a carpool, crash space, and so on.\n\nWhat’s more, I needed to do all of this in secret so that Erica would not get\na hint of what was going on. Given that we both work from home, this was going\nto be challenging; it made phone calls and face-to-face discussions with\ncoconspirators difficult.\n\nTo achieve this, I used Facebook for everything. First I created a private\nevent (private events don’t show up in the search results) and invited all the\nfriends I could think of who I knew she would want there. Then I looked\nthrough Erica’s friend list and friended the folks for whom I did not have\ncontact details so that I could invite them, too.\n\nWith the Facebook event having a communication area (the Wall), this provided\na great means for us to collaborate as a group around the event. People\nvolunteered to bring food, and could ask me what pots and pans we had, how\nmany plates we needed, when everyone should arrive, and other questions.\n\nEvery day the full group collaborated around the event, and everyone played a\npart in making it a tremendous night to remember for Erica. She had absolutely\nno idea beforehand and was flabbergasted when she found out, and everyone had\na great time at the party.\n\nThis was a case of a small community forming around a goal (making the party\nfun for Erica and everyone else), with social media providing the perfect\nengine to make it happen, along with the tools we needed to accomplish a great\noutcome. Social media made it simple for me to bring people into our little\ncommunity, and there was no learning curve required as everyone already knew\nhow to use Facebook. It was a great example of focused collaboration.\n\nOf course, there are many different forms of collaboration, and when assessing\nwhat collaborative opportunities are available to us in our communities, we\noften need to assess what tools we have available because these affect what we\ncan do. Collaboration is difficult to kick-start if people don’t have the\ntools they require to participate. We discussed this more in [Chapter\n5](ch05.html \"Chapter 5. Supporting Workflow with Tools and Data\").\n\nSocial media is heavily optimized toward some forms of collaboration and not\nothers. As an example, social networks are fantastic for communication, but at\nthe time of this writing they lack tools for collaborating around art and\nmedia, around code and software, and around documents. Of course, by the time\nyou read this, the situation may well have changed, but today I see three\nprimary opportunities for collaboration using social media:\n\nCommunication\n\n    \n\nThe vast majority of content that occurs in social networks involves\ncommunication between individuals and among groups. Using my example of\nErica’s party, all of the collaboration there was focused on planning who\nwould work on what and disseminating information to the group. Social networks\nare excellent resources for this.\n\nCampaigns and awareness\n\n    \n\nSocial networks are energized by your connecting to people you want to be\nconnected to, as well as opening up the potential to connect to many others\nyou don’t know. Campaigns and growing awareness are fueled by hitting momentum\nwith a message, and social media is ideal for this kind of work.\n\nEvents\n\n    \n\nAs I discussed earlier, social media is also ideal for collaborating around\nevents.\n\nLet’s now look in more detail at each of these areas.\n\n### Communication\n\nWhen many people think of collaboration, they often assume it means working\ntogether on content. This content could be documents, images, computer code,\nor anything else. A significant sphere of collaboration, however, involves\njust keeping in touch with others.\n\nI did some consultancy work for a contracting association that wanted to build\na community for its members. When I joined the project, they talked a lot\nabout collaboration and creating a community that could “solve problems\ntogether.” When I considered their high-level needs, I visualized them in my\nmind based on my collaborative experiences of working online with folks:\nidentifying what tools are needed, putting those tools in place, training\ncommunity members in their use, and creating a means of allowing the community\nto share content so that they could build on it together.\n\nIn reality, though, their definition of collaboration was much simpler. Their\ncommunity was populated by many separate businesses and organizations spread\nall over the US, and they wanted to see different members of these businesses\nsharing their experience, knowledge, and insight where it made sense to solve\nproblems, thus providing a useful and valuable resource for everyone.\n\nThis didn’t require any fancy tools. It didn’t need special methods of sharing\ncontent. It just needed a private social environment in which people could\ncommunicate safely and openly with one another. We used a social network for\nthat, and the results were well received by the members.\n\nWhat is wonderful about most social media networks (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn,\nGoogle+) is that they not only provide excellent tools for you and your\ncolleagues to communicate with one another, but also allow you to pick and\nchoose how these discussions are presented and to whom. As an example, the\nUbuntu community wants their discussions to be accessible and open to all, but\nthe contracting association example I just described needed a by-invitation-\nonly policy and a private environment. Social media provides this flexibility.\n\nFacebook has a feature called Facebook Groups that is particularly useful for\nthese kinds of communication-oriented communities. I recommend you take a\nlook.\n\n### Note\n\nGoogle and Yahoo! also provide similar group services. These includes\nfacilities for controlling membership, having discussions, and other features.\n\n### Campaigns and awareness\n\nIn October 2011 I saw a tweet that was retweeted by someone I follow, about a\nmissing girl in Los Angeles. The previous day the girl had gone to work and\nnever came back. Her parents and friends tried calling her, tried emailing\nher, and asked around, and they could not get in touch with her. Naturally,\nthey were terrified for her safety, and they notified the police. A missing\npersons report was drafted and the family hoped and prayed she would come home\nsoon, safe and sound.\n\nOne of the family members, desperate for options to find her, reached out on\nsocial media right away. She created a Facebook page for the missing girl and\nposted the missing persons poster from the police to the page. She then\nnotified all of her friends and encouraged her friends to notify their\nfriends, too. The Facebook page soon started getting more and more attention\nfrom more people. Not only did the page disseminate information and keep the\nflame burning to find the girl, but it also provided a means for viewers to\nshare their concern and support with the family, thus providing a sense of\nunity and comfort.\n\nThe family member who set up the Facebook page then started sending messages\nto celebrities in the Los Angeles area asking them to raise awareness about\nthe girl who had gone missing. The celebrities, and folks who followed the\ncelebrities, started retweeting the message one by one, each tweet pointing to\nthe Facebook page with the missing persons poster.\n\nAfter a few days, the family member who kicked off this social media machine\nreported that they had located the girl, safe and sound. She could not divulge\nwhat had happened to her for legal reasons, but everyone felt a unified sense\nof relief that she was safe.\n\nSocial media played a key role here in providing not only the tools to\ncoordinate such a campaign, but also a simple and effective means of spreading\nthe message. These capabilities make social media the perfect vehicle for\nraising public awareness of certain issues.\n\n### Note\n\nUnfortunately, social media can also be used in negative ways, as was the case\nin the London Riots in 2011 when social media was used to coordinate looting\nand other violence. As such, be aware how social media could potentially be\nused in a negative capacity that may impact your work and your local\ncommunity.\n\nIf you want to use social media for a campaign or awareness effort, the key is\nto build a compelling message quickly, to encourage everyone you know to\nparticipate, and to have them encourage others to participate as well. When\ncrafting your message, put together an effective elevator pitch that gets\nacross the goals of the campaign or awareness effort right away and makes it\nclear how other people’s participation can help accomplish the highlighted\ngoals. Most people will need to feel a sense of empowerment to feel motivated\nenough to support you.\n\nIn growing awareness and getting people involved, be careful to not spam or\nbully people into joining or following this work. The greatest social media\nawareness campaigns become viral quickly, but don’t overstep the bounds of\nsoliciting participation. By all means, encourage people to join and spread\nthe word, but don’t spam email inboxes, websites, social media feeds, or other\nplaces with your message. That will have the opposite effect and will put\npeople off.\n\nOf course, when you do have a popular campaign on a social media network, be\nsure to use it for a useful purpose. Unfortunately, many community leaders\nbuild all this momentum for people to join and then don’t provide\nopportunities for them to work on. When people take part, be sure there is a\nclear on-ramp of things they can participate in and be sure to celebrate their\naccomplishments with the rest of the group.\n\nFacebook pages, combined with Twitter and Google+ to spread the word, are\nexcellent tools for organizing these campaigns and awareness goals.\n\n### Events\n\nAs we discussed in the earlier example, social media is useful for\ncoordinating different kinds of events, and particularly for grassroots events\nin your local area.\n\nSome years ago, when some colleagues and I used to do the LugRadio podcast, we\norganized an annual event where we had guest presenters, arranged an\nexhibition, and put on a live show of a LugRadio podcast. It was a popular\nevent and we loved putting it together. This all happened largely before the\nsocial media phenomenon kicked off, and it was much more complex to organize\nthe event back then.\n\nThe reason for this is that LugRadio Live was fueled by the time and resources\ncontributed by community members on their own to help the event be successful.\nPeople would loan us projectors, PA systems, and funding for the event. They\nwould come and help form the crew to construct the stage, set up the chairs,\nhelp the presenters, and more. Such a collaborative community event hinged on\nhow all these moving parts worked together, and before social media we\ncoordinated this work with literally hundreds of emails going out to a set of\ncore contributors.\n\nThese days, you can create a Facebook event and coordinate everything there.\nFacebook events are not useful for gauging attendance, but they are useful for\nproviding a sense that everyone can participate in his own way, and you will\nfind people contributing their time and services in pleasantly surprising and\nunexpected ways. You can then extend your reach by spreading the word using\nTwitter, Google+, and other resources to encourage folks to join you and\nothers.\n\norm:swap-title: Key Points About Collaboration\n\n  * Social media is great for some collaborations, but not all; consider the best ways it can be used for your community.\n\n  * Communicating effectively is a form of collaboration, and social media is a wonderful tool for that.\n\n  * Campaigns can be ramped up quickly, but make the elevator pitch quick, effective, and inclusive.\n\n  * When people join a social media resource, ensure that they have something to do or collaborate on right away.\n\n  * Use all the social media networks together to extend the reach of your collaboration.\n\n  * Always be careful to not spam or pressure people into joining your social media campaigns and resources.\n\n# Social Media on Your Terms\n\nThose of you who have used social media at all as part of your general day-to-\nday life or as part of a community will have probably discovered that it can\nbecome something of an unwieldy beast. When you have your Twitter, Facebook,\nand Google+ accounts set up and you have started following, friending, and\nconnecting to people you know and people you are interested in, it is\nincredible how much time all this social media can take up.\n\nI would go one step further and say that social media can be a _complete time\nsink_.\n\nAs we have discussed throughout this chapter, social media offers a lot of\nopportunity, but if you are not smart about using it, it can end up running\nyour life and getting in the way of other valuable work and community\nbuilding. Let’s now look at some ways in which you can use social media as\nefficiently as possible.\n\n## Controlling the Fire Hose\n\nIf we look at just Twitter as an example, it is possible that you will end up\nfollowing over a few hundred people. These folks will probably be a mixture of\npeople in your communities, friends, people who you admire, and a few\ncelebrities thrown in for good measure. As you use Twitter more, and if you\nare particularly interesting, you may end up getting quite a few people\nfollowing you.\n\nAs you start following more people and more people follow you, Twitter can\nbecome increasingly hectic. Not only do you want to see the interesting\ncontent of the people you follow, but as your own follower count grows, so\nwill the number of responses you get to your tweets. Also factor in all the\ndifferent hashtags, search terms, and other elements that you want to keep\ntrack of.\n\nAnd the worst thing is that this covers _just Twitter_. You have the same\nchallenges with the other social networks.\n\nFortunately, there a number of applications that provide better interfaces to\nthe social networks. These applications offer desktop, phone, and tablet\nintegration of the networks and tools to optimize your use.\n\nThese tools offer a number of benefits. First, you don’t have to continually\nvisit the different social media websites and refresh them to see whether\nthere is new content; each time you refresh a site and there is nothing of\ninterest you waste your time. Second, many of these apps build these social\nnetworking features into your desktop, phone, or tablet and provide\nnotifications, updates, and more.\n\nAs an example, I just installed a tool called Gwibber that integrates social\nmedia into my Ubuntu desktop and provides features for displaying notification\nbubbles containing messages. It supports posting to multiple social media\nnetworks at once, and has an interface for easily performing searches and\nseeing the content I care about. There are countless other such applications\navailable; I won’t list them here because the list will become outdated, but a\nquick search online will turn up the most popular options.\n\nI recommend that you pick one of these tools and take some time getting to\nknow it and configuring it for your needs. One of the most beneficial elements\nof these apps is that they typically can be configured to show you the\ninformation you care about. As an example, I have Gwibber configured to pop up\nnotification bubbles only for messages that are directed to me (so I don’t get\na constant stream of irrelevant tweets from people I follow). This means I\nwill take breaks to check tweets posted by others, but outside of these\nTwitter breaks, I can continue with my normal community management work. If I\nsee a notification bubble with a message, I know it is something directed at\nme and something I might need to respond to. This prevents me from having to\nbreak my workflow to check for messages, particularly ones that don’t relate\nto me or require a response.\n\n## Optimizing How You Post\n\nConsidering all the social media networks available today, it’s likely that a\ncertain subset of people are on all the networks, while others are on only one\nor two. You will probably want to reach out to as many people as possible, and\nwriting a message and posting it individually to each network can quickly\nbecome a real pain.\n\nFor instance, when I started using social media, I would create a message on\nTwitter and then cut and paste it to identi.ca and then also to Facebook. With\nthe addition of Google+, Diaspora, ReverbNation, MySpace, and others, this\ntook a lot of time.\n\nThe glorious dream for many of us is to write our message once and see it\nposted automatically to each network. Fortunately, there are some tools and\nmethods for doing this. In general, they can be categorized as _client-side_\nor _server-side_ solutions.\n\nOn the client side, you can install an application that allows you to post to\nmultiple networks. As an example, the Gwibber client that I use in Ubuntu\nallows me to post to Twitter, Facebook, identi.ca, and many other networks.\nThis means that not only can I type in a message once and it gets posted to\neach service, but also the replies are collated into a single list.\n\nMany applications offer this functionality, and I recommend that you see which\nworks best for you.\n\nThe server-side approach involves finding applications or features available\non the social networks themselves that can provide this kind of cross-posting.\nAs an example, I use a Facebook app that automatically posts Twitter updates\nas status updates to Facebook. This means that I only need to use the standard\nTwitter website or a Twitter client and my posts automatically go to Facebook,\ntoo.\n\n## Being Socially Responsible\n\nThroughout this chapter we have talked a lot about technology, but social\nmedia at its heart is about the sharing and communication of language, ideas,\ncomments, opinions, and viewpoints. The social media wannabes that I so\ndelicately derided at the beginning of the chapter often obsess about the\ntechnology, but speak less about the social rules of engagement that come into\nplay when using these resources.\n\nIn our position as community leaders and managers we often have to be\nparticularly socially savvy, and this is especially true when using social\nmedia. While the 140-character limit in Twitter is useful for keeping messages\nconcise, it also brings some challenges in how we communicate, particularly on\nsensitive topics. Here are a few tips for overcoming these challenges:\n\nBe mindful of your tone\n\n    \n\nRemember that when you are using social media many different people are\nreading your content. This includes people from different walks of life and\ndifferent countries and cultures, people who know you at different levels, and\npeople who have differing opinions of you and your community. As such, mind\nthe tone you use, and try to be loose and social, yet professional.\n\nBe appropriate\n\n    \n\nOne of the challenges I have faced over the years is that of striving to\nalways be appropriate, yet breaking the ice enough that people can relax\naround me. A stiff, formal community manager is a bore, but a lewd, offensive\ncommunity manager won’t last long in a community. I always try to be\nprofessional and respectful, but also show my social side, posting messages\nabout music, my life, and my family, as well as various amusing duck-related\nphotos. Being appropriate does not mean being boring, it just means being\nmindful of not causing undue offense.\n\nDon’t always wear the flame suit\n\n    \n\nYour community, your members, and you are likely to be the victims of flaming,\nbickering, and trolling at some point. I have seen many community managers\nfeel the need to respond to every message and have the last word. Don’t\nsuccumb to this temptation. I recommend that you always strive to correct\nmisinformation, but remember that they are just words on the Internet and if\nyou try to debate everyone down, you will probably go mad.\n\nBe careful with mobile\n\n    \n\nA friend (who was a community manager at the time) told me a particularly\namusing story of how he sat on a plane one time with the doors about to close\nand was exchanging some rather fruity text messages with his girlfriend. Just\nas the steward asked him to switch off his phone he sent one last message to\nher to give her something to think about while he was flying, and\ninadvertently texted it to Twitter. All 800 of his followers got the message\nin their timelines. Fortunately, he had time to call his brother and ask him\nto delete it. I don’t think I need to outline the lesson in this story.\nSuffice it to say that if I had seen that tweet, I might have “accidentally”\nretweeted it. Just kidding....\n\nDon’t overdo it\n\n    \n\nAs I mentioned earlier in the chapter, always be mindful of not broadcasting\ntoo much material. Social media is awesome, but a constant stream of content\nfrom you promoting your community or your projects will likely turn off some\nfolks. Always strive to get a good balance of building buzz without building\nbile.\n\nRemember also that using social media effectively is a learning experience,\nand you will build your expertise by using it as well as by observing how\nother folks use it. You don’t have to be a social media expert at the\nbeginning of this adventure. Play with the technology, send out some messages,\nand learn as you go. You will pick it up in next to no time.\n\n## Organizing a Community Event\n\nThe year 2008 was a busy one for me. Not only was I in the process of moving\nto the Untied States to live with my wife, but also I was settling into a new\nlife, was meeting new friends, had just released an album, and had just signed\nthe contract to write _The Art of Community_.\n\nI wanted to write _The Art of Community_ to share my thesis on how to build\nand grow a productive and inspiring community, and I wanted to use the book to\ntrigger more discussion about community management ideas, best practices, and\napproaches. As I settled into the brutal writing schedule, I was excited about\nthe book, but I still felt like something was missing. Seemingly being someone\nwho prefers to replace sleep with heartburn, I decided there was one\nadditional thing I wanted to work on: a central event and meeting place for\ncommunity managers.\n\nLike many community managers, I had traveled around the world, trudging from\nconference to conference to talk up my communities, but I had little\nopportunity to sit down with other community managers, including those from\ncompeting companies, to discuss our craft. Back then, community management was\nstill very much in its infancy, so I assumed the attendance would be fairly\nsmall, and an intimate event could generate some really great discussion.\n\nAnd thus was born the _Community Leadership Summit_ , which is now an annual\nevent that attracts over 200 community managers each year. Be sure to put it\nin your calendar; find out more at\n<http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/>.\n\nWhen creating the event I used social media extensively; what follows are\ndetails of how I used social media at the most recent incarnation of the event\nat the time of this writing, the Community Leadership Summit 2011.\n\n### The buildup\n\nFor the 2011 summit, which marked the third year of the event, I had nearly\nall of the organizational elements down pat; the venue, A/V equipment, room\nlayout, scheduling facilities, catering, sponsorship, and other components\nwere a piece of cake to put together. I now had the skeleton of the event and\nI needed to excite and motivate community leaders from around the world to\njoin us in Portland, Oregon.\n\nTo do this I set up a series of social media resources in addition to the\nevent’s home page. First, I created a Facebook Event for the event. In it I\nadded all the logistical details of when and where the event was to take\nplace, links to the website, links to travel and hotel details, and so on. I\nalso created a vibrant image for the Facebook Event to attract people to click\non it (I included the dates of the event in the picture to really drill the\ninformation into people’s minds).\n\nIn addition to adding the boilerplate details, I posted some content to the\nWall to provide a sense that the event was already active. I posted some links\nto content on the website, details about the focus of the event, attendee\ndetails, and more.\n\nHaving created the event, I then invited all of my friends on Facebook who\nwould likely be interested or available to attend. When you create a Facebook\nEvent you get an indication of whether people can attend, may attend, or won’t\nattend. This was a useful indicator of likely attendance, although for a free\nevent like the Community Leadership Summit, it is normal for people to say\nthey will attend and then not show up. (In my experience, 50% of the people\nwho say they will attend free events actually do show up.)\n\nAt this point I was waiting for people to see the invitation on Facebook and\nhopefully mark the event in their calendars. Now I needed to expand the\npublicity of the event across other social networks and resources.\n\nSo next I wrote a blog post about the focus of the event, highlighted the\ndates and location (making them boldface so that they stood out in the blog\npost), and included some pictures to show how dynamic and people-focused the\nevent is. I posted this on my blog first because it is aggregated across a\nnumber of other resources (e.g., some news sites related to the communities I\nmanage). Another benefit of posting the blog entry was that my publicity of\nthe event across social media circles would give me something to point people\nto in case they wanted to read more about it. It is far more effective when\nannouncing an event to provide a link to a blog entry with all the details and\nan inspirational and encouraging tone than it is to just post the dates and\nlocation of the event.\n\nI then started sending out a regular stream of messages to Twitter (which\nwould be automatically posted to Facebook) talking about different elements of\nthe event as it unfolded. This effort included the following activities:\n\n  * I regularly updated the list of confirmed attendees and announced it to encourage folks to see all the cool people who would be at the event.\n\n  * I posted about new features in the event as they were confirmed.\n\n  * With each sponsor confirmed, I posted about the sponsor, what they were providing, and other related content. This clearly pleased the sponsors as well as giving potential attendees a sense that important companies considered the event significant.\n\n  * As the social events were finalized, I posted about the venues, times, and what was going on.\n\n  * For this event, some sessions were coordinated online among many attendees, and I posted about cool sessions that were forming.\n\n  * I also posted countdown messages (e.g., “Only a week until the Community Leadership Summit!”).\n\nFrom the beginning of this series of tweets, I also picked a hashtag to use\n(#cls11). This would provide a means for people to meet other participants by\nsending content to the same hashtag. This also was a useful tool for me to see\nall tweets to that hashtag to get a general feel for people’s views of the\nevent.\n\nFinally, I used one of the Twitter boxes that you can get from the Twitter\nwebsite and embedded it on the event’s website. This provided a rolling list\nof tweets to the #cls11 hashtag, and also provided a feel that the event was\nattracting a lot of activity and interest.\n\n### At the event\n\nIn terms of the event itself, as people arrived, social media also played a\nkey role. Before the event even started, people were using the #cls11 hashtag\nto coordinate travel, hotels, crash space, meeting points and times, and more.\nAs the main organizer, I was also continually checking the hashtag feed to\nensure that everything was fine and people had all the information they\nneeded.\n\nWhen the event started, Twitter became a particularly useful resource. Many\nfolks tweeted continually throughout the event. They shared notable quotes and\ncomments from sessions, along with takeaways and lessons learned. They\ninteracted with one another and retweeted one another’s comments. When I did\nthe opening keynote on the first day, I used the Twitter client on my phone to\nread a series of reviews about how well I did. I tell you, having a phone with\na means of sending and receiving Twitter messaging is really handy at events.\n\nTwitter was also a useful way for people to collaborate throughout the event\nand share further information. Photos were taken and uploaded online. People\nshared links to reports, comments, and photos, and used Twitter to get in\ntouch with me and the other organizers.\n\n## Running a Campaign\n\nAs I’ve mentioned earlier, outside of my passion for community, my other main\npassion is heavy metal, and playing heavy metal in bands and solo projects. I\nhave been a huge metal fan since I was but a wee lad, and I have been playing\nin bands since I was 16.\n\nOne of those bands is Severed Fifth. The goal of the project was simple: build\na community around the premise of giving the music away for free. We\nencouraged listeners and fans to participate in spreading the word about the\nband and the project.\n\nWhen I started Severed Fifth, it was just a solo project. I wrote my first\nalbum, _Denied By Reign_ , and released it online for free. Shortly after I\nmoved to the US I started writing the second album but also formed a live band\nto get out and play the music. With the second album ready, I recorded a demo\nmyself (I played all the instruments and recorded it in my home studio). Then\nwe decided as a band that we wanted to record the full album-length demo\nprofessionally.\n\nDoing this was going to require some serious coin, but I came up with a\ncunning plan: let’s see whether our community would support us and help fund\nthe recording of an album. This album could then become a good example of a\nFree Culture-supported project, thus demonstrating the potential of this new\nmusic industry model. And thus the Severed Fifth Recording Campaign started.\n\n### The preparation\n\nTo get things off the ground, first I set up a PayPal account to receive the\nfunds. Then I created a page on the Severed Fifth website where people could\nmake a donation. Originally I simply wrote some text on the page to encourage\npeople to contribute, but then I had the idea of doing something more visual;\nnamely, a video.\n\nUsing a small video camera, I filmed myself speaking to the camera. I\nexplained how we planned to influence the music industry via our new model,\nand how contributing to the recording of the album could help us contribute to\nmoving the industry along. I embedded the video on the page and put the\ndonation box next to the video. The method of receiving payments was now good\nto go.\n\nIn addition, I ensured that I had social media accounts registered across a\nrange of networks. I set up accounts on Twitter and identi.ca, created a page\non Facebook, and created accounts on more music-centric sites such as MySpace,\nReverbNation, Last.fm, and libre.fm.\n\nReverbNation was a particularly useful resource here. It allowed me to enter a\nmessage and then it would send that message to all connected accounts, which\nincluded Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace. This provided a simple and effective\nmeans for me to maximize the outreach of the content.\n\n### The buildup\n\nI then started an intensive campaign to raise awareness of the Severed Fifth\nRecording Campaign across the different social media resources. As the\ndonations rolled in, I regularly updated followers about how we were edging\ncloser to our goal. I also highlighted those who gave particularly impressive\ndonations; we had a few $300 donations come in, and I specifically highlighted\nand wrote a blog post about their tremendous generosity.\n\nAs the weeks rolled on, I regularly provided a series of blog updates that I\npointed to across the social networks. I also used video continually. I put\ntogether a few update videos summarizing much of the great work and\ncontributions going on in the community, and I also released a video\nhighlighting all of the contributors as well as the countries they were from.\nThis not only gave the contributors a pleasant surprise for being included in\nthe video, but it also showed the sheer number of folks who donated and the\ntruly global source of the donations.\n\nIn the end we raised over $4,000 to fund the album. It was another example of\nthe power of community and the generosity and belief that people can have in\nprojects that resonate with them. Many thanks to everyone who contributed!\n\n## Providing Community Updates\n\nOne of the most effective uses of social media is to disseminate news and\ninformation about what is going on in your community. This is something we\nhave used extensively in Ubuntu and I want to share a few tips and tricks\nhere.\n\nYou should make a point of ensuring that your community is well represented\nacross the social media networks. Be sure to register a Twitter account for\nyour community, a page for it on Facebook, and information on other networks\nwhere appropriate.\n\nThe Ubuntu community is a large one, distributed across a number of different\nteams, so we registered a series of different Twitter and Facebook pages to\nrepresent each team. Likewise, we have many different websites for these\ndifferent teams, and have integrated boxes with recent tweets across those\npages as well. When a piece of news is ready to share we make a point of\nsharing it over the most relevant resources, and often cross-posting to all\nwhere it makes sense.\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n[2] That should freak at least one guy out…” _the book is talking to me!_ \"\n\n\n# Chapter 7. Building Buzz\n\n“A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds.”\n\n—Sir Francis Bacon [3]\n\nOn February 17, 2000, Ben, my pal from university, picked me up from my\nstudent halls of residence in Wolverhampton. Delicately held under my arm was\na large cardboard penguin and a spindle of Linux CDs. This was a special day:\nMicrosoft Windows 2000 was released.\n\nJust a few weeks before, on the other side of the world in Arizona, Deepak\nSaxena had an idea. With the looming release of Windows 2000, Deepak wanted to\nsee Linux user groups and open source enthusiasts take to the streets to\nspread the word of open source. Deepak saw the opportunity, and was determined\nto make it count. He decided to convert a major milestone for Windows into a\n“Linux Demo Day” when thousands of Linux supporters would evangelize their\nlove of free software.\n\nWithin a few weeks, Deepak had persuaded many of the companies in the Linux\nspace—including Caldera, EST, Linuxcare, Linux Central, Linux Mall, Red Hat,\nSGI, SuSE, Turbo Linux, and TuxTops—to contribute to his cause. He had\npublicity from some of the largest online tech news sites, and over 150 Linux\nuser groups interested in joining in. Deepak’s little idea had become a\ncoordinated worldwide effort.\n\nMy group was one cog in this global machine. Five of us climbed into Ben’s\ncar, which he drove at a disturbing speed to nearby Birmingham. We proceeded\nto visit computer and software retailers, bookshops, and libraries, and in\nsome cases, walk up and talk to complete strangers. Unlike those strangers, we\nwere unfazed.\n\nThroughout the day, we explained and reexplained why open source was\nimportant. We talked about the ethos, the belief, and the community. We\napplied our enthusiasm to the slightly bemused subjects before us. It was a\nlong day, but as we drove back to our native Wolverhampton, we were proud of\nour efforts. Our unity warmed us on that cold day in England.\n\nDeepak’s Linux Demo Day demonstrates the potential of community advocacy.\nDriven by a compelling reason to get out of bed and fueled by a combination of\nsimple tools and elbow grease, the result was stunning. Whether or not the\nactions of February 17, 2000 had any impact on Microsoft is irrelevant. What\nwas fascinating was the mechanics: the way in which a volunteer community\nrallied together behind a shared ethos on the same day, all around the world.\n\nDeepak created _buzz_. He generated interest, excitement, and a willingness to\ncontribute to a shared campaign.\n\nThis chapter dissects the science of buzz. Buzz is an important part of our\ncommunity, and it is important that we get it right because missteps can often\nbe problematic. As such, we will first discuss the key attributes of great\nbuzz, what to avoid, and how to articulate ourselves. We will then move on to\ndiscuss the _buzz cycle_ and the practical implications for different methods\nof building buzz around your project.\n\n# Mindshare\n\nEvery year without fail, an article bubbles its way to the surface claiming\nthat this is the “ _year of the Linux desktop_.” Each time, a new journalist\nsteps up to the plate, and each time the journalist gets it wrong. Although\nonce an exciting and testy headline, today it is one big cliché.\n\nThe so-called “year of the Linux desktop” is commonly understood to indicate\nwhen Linux seriously threatens the market share of Microsoft and Apple. Year\nafter year, we see these claims, and to be honest, I don’t blame the\njournalists. We are bombarded with articles claiming huge growth in Linux. We\nhear about people migrating; new deals; large companies and governments\nswitching over; and Linux features in magazines, books, and even television\nshows. It is easy to feel like those of us on the Linux side of the fence are\nrocking the world.\n\nIn our scramble to find party hats and shot glasses, it seems the analysts\nwant to rain on our parade. Some cite 1% market share, some 5%, and some 20%.\nWhichever you choose to believe, the analysts are far more conservative. This\nrather predictably sets off a lengthy debate about whether you can count\nsoftware that can be freely copied, over and over again.\n\nYou know what? In the end it doesn’t matter.\n\nSome vector within the great mythic noosphere, the “sphere of human thought,”\nprobably knows exactly how many Linux desktops there are in the world, but\nactual usage doesn’t mean a bean in the scheme of things. What really matters\nis _mindshare_.\n\nMindshare is perception. It is a global gut feeling. Mindshare and perception\nis the magic that wins hearts and minds. It is also the explosive, seductive\nsubstance that clears the path for change, and it is mindshare that enables\ncommunities to have a voice.\n\n## The Mindshare Opportunity\n\nJamie Oliver is a television chef. Known in England for his young and fresh\napproach to cooking, he has always been popular with foodies and amateur cooks\nalike. Despite career success, Jamie was not content. He wanted to change\nsomething very specific: school meals.\n\nThe United Kingdom faced serious health problems in school kids. Obesity had\ndoubled. Eighty percent of kids predominantly ate junk food, and the food\nparents were giving them was not exactly healthy. In a typical lunchbox, 55%\nof kids got potato crisps, 40% got a chocolate bar, and 33% got a carton of a\nsugary drink.\n\nA significant part of the problem had to do with the meals served to kids each\nlunchtime in school cafeterias across the country. Every day, 3.2 million kids\nwere served on a budget of merely 68p. Unfortunately, that 68p was seemingly\nfunding fried food and other junk.\n\nJamie wanted change. Although he had a television show about the topic and a\nreputation, he knew he couldn’t change this alone. He worked hard to make the\nissue one that the nation cared about. Articles, blogs, radio shows, and other\nmediums were behind Jamie’s campaign. After a few months, it seemed that\nhealthy school meals were the hot topic all over England. Jamie achieved\nmindshare.\n\nWith mindshare came change: meetings with the prime minister, new government\nguidelines, and better school meals for kids. Jamie got the entire country\nbehind his crusade, and kids now have a better shot at a healthier lifestyle.\n\nMindshare has two potential outcomes, depending on which side of the topic you\nsit. If you agree with the campaign, it reinforces and strengthens your will\nand perspective. For those who are not on board, mindshare often causes them\nto reevaluate.\n\nThis harks back to our earlier example of Linux. In recent years, Linux has\ngenerated tremendous mindshare. The software and its formation have inspired a\ngeneration of technologists, who have in turn inspired others. This mindshare\nhas caused many to reevaluate their choices in computing.\n\nThis was particularly the case around the time Windows Vista was released and\na new buying cycle opened. Many organizations faced stiff hardware\nrequirements for Vista, so it was a great time to evaluate alternatives, and\nboth Linux and Apple prospered.\n\n# The Building Blocks of Buzz\n\nIn this chapter we want to build excitement and mindshare around our\ncommunities. We want to motivate, inspire, and encourage people to join us and\nachieve our goals together. If we get this right, we have the opportunity to\nbuild a great team and make some incredible things happen.\n\nWhile some of you reading this book may have a marketing background, it is\nimportant to stress that traditional marketing strategies probably won’t wash\nwith your community. You can’t rely on press releases and advertising; you\ncan’t depend on buzzwords and slogans; and often you can’t easily measure the\nimpact of your message. Whereas marketing traditionally requires a budget, no\nbudget is required here. Buzz in this world is subtler and more organic.\n\nWhile we are making comparisons to traditional marketing, it is also important\nto note that the process of building buzz in community does not need to be\ncentralized. You don’t need to appoint a marketing manager for the community\nand have everything go through him. You should instead encourage everyone in\nyour community to learn the skills behind building great buzz.\n\nThis harks back to business expert Peter Drucker’s often-cited lesson that\ngreat customers help create great customers. You should likewise help your\ncontributors encourage and enthuse other contributors to join the community. I\nwould highly recommend that you send this chapter to your contributors in your\nproject to help them learn the building blocks of buzz.\n\n## The Mission\n\nEvery community has a mission. Back in [Chapter 2](ch02.html\n\"Chapter 2. Planning Your Community\"), we kicked off our strategic plan with\nour mission statement. In it we documented what we are setting out to achieve\nwith our community. Your mission is critical to building buzz. First of all,\nyou can’t expect to generate excitement around an idea you can’t articulate,\nso by developing a mission statement you sow the seeds of buzz. Second,\ndeveloping a mission statement trains you to describe your goals and\nexcitement succinctly. The mission is what will pique the interest of your\nnext generation of community members.\n\nThe ideal mission statement is concise, specific, and functional; we worship\nvigorously at the altar of conciseness. Unfortunately, being concise,\nspecific, and functional is not going to excite your potential community\nmembers. They are not going to get excited about strategic plans either. They\nare not going to get excited about governance, and they are most certainly not\ngoing to get excited about processes. Our mission needs to dim the lights,\nthrow on some Barry White, and get…sexy...\n\n## Uniting Together\n\nBuzz is all about excitement, and excitement is about dreams. We need to\npresent a dream so compelling that it will inspire people to join you to make\nit happen. Let’s begin by taking some inspiration from politics.\n\nI know what you are thinking. Politics? Sexy?\n\nAlthough too many politicians focus on themselves, politics is an activity\nengaged in by communities. Political parties in democratic countries cannot\nachieve their goals without widespread support from those they govern. They\ngather this support by presenting a dream of the future that appeals to the\nelectorate. Each of these activities has parallels with community building.\n\nThe similarities go further. Politics is, in essence, not all that\ninteresting. Political parties spend their days arguing over policies,\nmanifestos, taxes, inflation, and the other details of government. Around\nelection time they have to transform these eye-glazingly mundane concepts into\nexciting statements that inspire a nation.\n\nAn interesting example of this happened in 1996. Putting political persuasions\nto one side, let’s explore how the New Labour party built momentum around its\npolitical initiatives. It all started when a rather young and grinning Tony\nBlair became the leader of the opposition party in the United Kingdom.\n\nBack then the country was deeply dissatisfied with the ruling Conservative\nParty. Prime Minister John Major had failed to enthuse the country, and the\nparty was riddled with allegations of sleaze and political unrest. But despite\nmultiple attempts to gain power, the Labour party had failed to unseat the\nruling Tories for 18 years. Labour was branded by many with a “second-prize”\npolitical reputation.\n\nThen, Tony Blair gave birth to his concept of New Labour. He was personable\nand different, an instant antithesis to the plain and stuffy political norms\nof the day. Blair formed his team and came bounding into visibility with his\nmantra of “New Labour: Because Britain Deserves Better.”\n\nBlair wanted to enthuse the electorate. Reams of inspiring, motivational\nlanguage were unleashed on an unsuspecting British public. Consider these\nexamples from the 1997 election manifesto (see\n<http://australianpolitics.com/uk/labour/97-labour-manifesto.shtml>):\n\n> I believe in Britain. It is a great country with a great history. The\n> British people are a great people. But I believe Britain can and must be\n> better: better schools, better hospitals, better ways of tackling crime, of\n> building a modern welfare state, of equipping ourselves for a new world\n> economy.\n>\n> I want a Britain that is one nation, with shared values and purpose, where\n> merit comes before privilege, run for the many not the few, strong and sure\n> of itself at home and abroad.\n>\n> I want a Britain that does not shuffle into the new millennium afraid of the\n> future, but strides into it with confidence.\n\nPretty stunning stuff.\n\nAlthough younger than his opposition, Blair was a savvy political player. He\nknew that the British public had lost faith not only in the Tories, but also\nin politics itself. He knew that the first time people read, watched, or heard\nabout New Labour, he had only seconds to grab them and build their support. He\nneeded to build buzz, quickly and efficiently.\n\nAs part of this, he developed what Labour called a “Pledge Card.” This small\ncard was carried by politicians and listed five concrete promises. Back then,\nthe combination of “concrete promises” and “politicians” was not typical in\nBritish politics. Blair’s approach was honest and frank, and the nation\nresponded. On May 1, 1997, Tony Blair’s New Labour party was elected into\ngovernment in a landslide victory. Labour achieved the highest number of seats\nin the party’s history. I remember when it happened. I had a bowl haircut. The\ncountry felt invigorated and full of hope for a bright new future.\n\n## Inspired Words\n\nA critical component in Labour’s victory was its ability to inspire. Words\nwere carefully chosen to be visionary but not tacky. However, these words\nwould have meant nothing if it were not for the underlying message and\nconfidence in Tony Blair that promised a brighter new future.\n\nLabour’s words offered huge hope for many who were disillusioned with\npolitics. They spoke of “renew[ing] our country’s faith,” they talked of “our\ncontract with the people,” and Blair dreamed of “a Britain which we all feel\npart of, in whose future we all have a stake, in which what I want for my own\nchildren I want for yours.” Blair’s ability to level himself with the rest of\nthe country and inspire a joint feeling of change was a work of genius.\n\nWhen delivered well, this kind of motivational writing can make those little\nhairs on the back of your neck stand on end. The use of words such as _vision_\n, _faith_ , and _future_ helps to paint the dream of freedom, opportunity, and\nin some cases, healing old wounds. This is the language that will inspire your\nfuture community members, and you should endeavor to use it where appropriate.\n\nThe greatest inspirational writers are those who have been exposed to great\ninspirational writing. There have been many great orators throughout history:\nWinston Churchill and Martin Luther King, Jr. to name just two. Many websites\nhave recordings and transcripts of their speeches. I highly recommend\nlistening to or reading them and identifying the parts that you find most\ninspiring. Watch out for that tingly feeling up your spine. It is that feeling\nthat we want to create.\n\nInspiration is not limited to real politics. Many movies, TV shows, and books\ninclude powerful, inspired speeches written by hugely talented writers. I\nrecommend watching Martin Sheen as President of the United States in _The West\nWing_. He delivers some exceptional neck-hair-raising monologues.\n\nThere is no secret recipe for creating community enthusiasm. There is no\nblueprint. It is as organic and unique as the very community you wish to grow.\nThe most important tip to remember about inspirational messaging is that it\nmust be genuine. Whatever path we follow to build our communities, our leaders\nmust instill a sense of trust and representation. The enemy here is in\nappearing contrived and disingenuous. Our inspiration must be natural and\ngenuine. If you are real, your community will see that.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s easy to risk being seen as a fake. The word _community_\nhas been twisted and contorted to mean many things over the years, some of\nwhich don’t exactly fall in line with what many of us would consider a\ncommunity.\n\nThe reason for this is that the word _community_ almost always conjures up a\npositive mental image. It alludes to togetherness, compassion, and equality.\nAs such, it has been a target of hype and hot air. If an organization,\ncompany, or individual wants to be seen in a positive and engaging light,\nliberal use of the word _community_ makes sense.\n\nThere will always be a natural tension between the inspiring speaker and the\naudience. The speaker will always have a goal or agenda of her own, but needs\nto strike a balance between honesty around her personal ambitions and an\nassurance that she takes the wider values of the community to heart.\n\nIf your definition of community does not extend to the common expectation of\nvolunteer environments, you will receive short shrift quickly. Readers seeking\nto build communities around commercial products should be particularly\ncognizant of this risk. Always remember that whatever their focus, communities\nare organic units of interest and collaboration. They live and breathe on an\nunderstanding that community efforts benefit the community as a whole. Anyone\nwho tampers with that ethos will face problems. This is a critically important\npoint, and I recommend that you read this paragraph again twice. Go on, I will\nwait.\n\n## Becoming the Advocate\n\nWhen we build buzz, we enter into a relationship with the audience. Advocates\nand salespeople each enter the same approximation of the relationship, but the\nrules of engagement vary. Both of these different roles encourage adoption of\na product, technology, or lifestyle via positive messaging and reinforcement.\nHow they differ is in how the person who is performing the messaging is\nperceived.\n\nI have always considered myself an advocate. I define advocacy as the putting\nforward of a positive message and investing one’s personal reputation in that\nmessage. Advocates recommend only products, technologies, and lifestyles that\nthey personally subscribe to. Those people on street corners who want to talk\nyour ear off about human rights are advocates. They may be annoying, but they\ngenuinely live their message. For them it is not a job; it is a lifestyle.\n\nSales are different. Some (not all) salespeople exemplify the philosophy of “I\ncould sell ice to Eskimos.” In other words, they take pride in their ability\nto make the sale. The pride is in being convincing and charismatic. As such,\nsalespeople are often able to detach themselves from the product they are\nselling. They can effectively work for any company that sells something.\n\nI used to work at OpenAdvantage, a government-funded organization tasked with\nspreading open source software in the West Midlands region of England. Every\nyear my colleagues and I worked with hundreds of businesses, charities,\neducational and governmental institutions, and individuals. OpenAdvantage was\na vendor-neutral playground. We could recommend whatever solutions we liked to\nour clients. This became a trial by fire. In my two years there, I tested\nhundreds of different tools, systems, and applications. In that time we\ndeveloped preferences that were personal and not mandated by any other\nagreement or contention. Like any government-funded project, it had a time\nlimit. We had two years. Around six months before the sand was due to empty\nout of the hourglass, I started looking at other opportunities.\n\nAt this point I discovered I was really an advocate: I found it near\nimpossible to consider working for a company that made something that I did\nnot 100% choose, believe in, and make part of my life. I did some stringent\nanalyses on the products I used every day, and this is how I came to work at\nCanonical: Ubuntu was my choice of operating system.\n\nThis makes life tough for an advocate. It means that in your heart of hearts,\nyou can get out there and shout from the rooftops only about what you truly\nbelieve in. It also requires that implicit honesty in both directions: if your\nproduct sucks, you don’t cover it up but instead try to fix it.\n\nThe upside is that when people know you are an advocate, and know this is how\nyou tick, your opinion _really_ counts to them. Advocacy requires trust: you\nare putting your belief behind your words. If people like you and trust you,\nthey are likely to trust and like what you are advocating.\n\n## Getting It Right by Not Getting It Wrong\n\nTrust is complex to achieve and easy to lose. Months of positive moves are\nrequired to gain it, and one misstep can shatter it. With trust comes\nresponsibility, and you have a responsibility to approach your buzz in the way\nthat you would want others to approach you.\n\nMaking a lot of noise is easy. Spammers do it. They send out millions of\nemails advertising a product without any concern for whether the recipient\nmight be interested. The last time I checked, I really didn’t need Viagra. Out\nof the millions of emails that they send, some tiny proportion of people will\nbuy spammers’ products. With email’s low cost to send, the cost of annoying\nthe world is relatively cheap and the financial rewards are real.\nUnfortunately, becoming the scourge of the Internet is a price some people are\nwilling to pay.\n\nOf course, the major problem with spam is that it is unsolicited. I don’t\nchoose to receive emails about Viagra and Cialis. I never signed up for an\nannouncements mailing list. I never informed anyone that I wanted to receive\nthat email. I received the email purely because I have an email address.\nSpammers don’t care who receives the spam, and anyone who can, will.\n\nTo avoid the disgust that this provokes, we need to always ensure that our\nbuzz is relevant. When we seek to excite and inspire people to join our\ncommunity, we must target the right demographic. Our buzz always needs to be\nhonest.\n\nWe are all human, and we will all be tempted at some point to target those\noutside our demographic. Don’t. Sending unsolicited messages to people, no\nmatter how you do it, will not only frustrate many people, but could harm your\ncommunity. Who would want to join a community with a reputation for spamming?\nI certainly wouldn’t.\n\n## Honesty\n\nUnfortunately, honesty is more complicated than you may think. It is not just\nabout the black-and-white approach of not lying. Even the kindest hearts can\nsometimes get a little carried away with buzz building and promote an image\nand a culture that is not entirely representative of the reality. It is\ntempting to lavish a more exciting spin on your community.\n\nDon’t be tempted into building a false prophecy: it never works. There is\nnothing wrong with getting excited and enthusiastic. Tell the world your\ncommunity has grand ambitions, and inspire people to join. Just don’t sell\nyour prospective contributors a story that doesn’t exist. Don’t tell them you\nhave achieved things you haven’t. Don’t tell them you have more people\ninvolved than you do.\n\nCommunity is all about transparency and openness. In such a frank and\nunclouded environment, such exaggerations and fibs will be outed sooner than\nyou think. When such nonsense is revealed, it causes a lack of faith in you\nand your community. Remember, _trust is a non-negotiable requirement of\ncommunity leaders_. Don’t risk it.\n\nDon’t Build Yourself Up by Tearing Others Down\n\nBuzz is a great thing. It’s all about the glass being half full. It is about\ncelebrating opportunity, and identifying what collaboration can achieve when\nwe all share the same passion.\n\nUnfortunately, some communities and leaders feel that spreading negative\nenergy is an acceptable way to further their own communities. Second to\nfibbing about your community, disparaging another community for your own\nbenefit is about the worst thing you can do. It makes you and your community\nappear petty and indignant. Unfortunately, particularly in online communities,\nthis happens more often than not.\n\nAs members of your community get more and more well known (and this could\ninclude you), a sense of representation often sets in. People begin to feel\nthat they need to not only defend the community at all costs, but also to do\nit publicly. We then see disagreements and spats played out in embarrassing\ndetail, making the participants look like overopinionated teenagers.\n\n# Setting Up Your Base\n\nMany see buzz as a one-way street, analogous to television. They see it as a\nbroadcasted message that people consume. They also see our primary goal as\nproducing a message to be consumed. This is really only half of the goal.\n\nWhen building buzz, we need to understand what we want. Our buzz is about our\ncommunity and what our community achieves. When people experience our\ncarefully crafted messages, what do we want them to do? What is _their_ next\nstep? What is _our_ next step?\n\nA website is _essential_ to achieve this. Whether your community is focused\naround technology, knitting, animal welfare, supporting the poor, or\notherwise, a website is a critical resource that you should build and\nmaintain. The ubiquity of the Internet and the low cost of equipment to view\nit have made an online presence the storefront for your community. If someone\nhears about your community, the first step he will take is to search for it.\n\nWhether someone hits your website because he stumbled upon it or whether he\nread about it as part of your buzz, now is the time to grab his attention. You\nneed to enthuse him and pump him up, and while he is engaged, get him up the\nramp to be a contributor as easily as possible. Unfortunately, many\ncommunities don’t do this very well.\n\nSome still see the Web as a largely static medium. You put up a web page, and\nonce it is up, it never changes. These folks see websites merely as electronic\ninformation leaflets. My brother Martin used to be like this.\n\nMartin is heavily involved in conservation, and he runs an organization in\nNorthern England called [Rotters](http://www.rotters.org/). He and his family\nworked hard to secure land and set up facilities to perform community\ncomposting, train ex-prisoners and unemployed members of the local area, and\nrun events. One such event is his woodland festival: a cornucopia of rural\nattractions, including metalwork, chainsaw tree sculpture, performance art,\nand live music.\n\nMartin is an outdoorsy guy. He spends all day every day outside with his work.\nHe is the kind of guy who just enjoys being knee-deep in mud and soaked to the\nskin on a cold English day. Yes, he is mad. Martin was never much of a\ncomputer guy. His organization’s website was a fairly boring-looking page with\ninformation that was once current but never got updated.\n\nBut computers became more intrinsic to his life and his organization. He\nstarted keeping accounts there, printing fliers and other publicity material,\nand using eBay to buy and sell equipment. Before long, he and his team rebuilt\nthe website into a vibrant resource about the organization. It had pictures,\nstories, news, and more. Since the website has been refreshed, Rotters has\nreceived more publicity, members, and interest.\n\nYour website is your community’s Embassy of Buzz. Make it rock.\n\n## Aims\n\nBuilding a great website may seem like a daunting process. The foundation,\nthough, is simple. Your website should seek to satisfy the following aim:\n\nProvide a current resource that answers questions and maintains a relationship\nwith the reader.  \n---  \n  \nWrite this down and stick it on your wall. Tattoo your children with it if you\nneed to. Let’s break this down into key areas. Keep these aspects in mind when\nconsidering how to build your site:\n\nGreat overview\n\n    \n\nIf I visit your website, I want to be able to get an overview of the\ncommunity, its goals, and how to get involved, all within the space of a few\nminutes. This information should be up-front, easy to access, and easy to\nread, and should have a simple web address that you can point people to (e.g.,\n_www.myproject.com/overview_).\n\nGreat documentation\n\n    \n\nYour website should provide documentation and guidance for all aspects of your\ncommunity. This will always be an ongoing process, but you should consider\nwhich aspects of your community are most important and need to be documented.\nAs an example, the process that new members follow to join your community\nshould be a priority.\n\nGreat communication\n\n    \n\nYou should ensure that it is really easy for people to get in touch with you\nwith questions, suggestions, and feedback. I recommend that at a minimum you\nhave an email address that is easy to access. This is a notable problem with\nmany blogs. Many blogging tools (such as WordPress at the time of this\nwriting) do not provide an easy-to-access contact link, and this can make it\nimpossible to get in touch with the author of the blog.\n\nBuilding a website is a little like painting a picture or writing a song: it\nis never finished. Creative types always want to add a last fleck of paint or\nfinal flourish on the guitar. With a seemingly endless stream of possibility\nwith your website, you need to prioritize. To do this, write down a list of\neverything you want to achieve, and then order it by what you consider most\ncritical. Naturally, elements such as the contributor ramp should be near the\ntop of the list.\n\n## Staying Current\n\nThe most important element in any website is content, and the most important\ngolden rule with content is that it needs to be _current_ and _accurate_. Of\ncourse, those two terms are somewhat intermingled: content about your\ncommunity that is on your website from 1998 is probably not going to be all\nthat accurate anymore.\n\nCreating current content is a two-part process. First, your community\nprocesses and methodologies need to be up-to-date. There is nothing more\nfrustrating than joining a community, following the published guidelines to\nget involved, and then being told that the guidelines are out of date and that\nyou need to adjust your work. That is a surefire way to annoy new\ncontributors.\n\nThe second area, and the area that fits in neatly with buzz, is news and\nupdates. Your site needs to be a window to exciting content about the\ncommunity, and this window needs to be updated regularly. If you want people\nto keep coming back to your website, you need to give them a reason. That\nreason is fresh content.\n\nYou should build a strategy for publishing news. This in itself may seem like\na simple task. I know what you are thinking: “Jono, I will just regularly post\nsomething new to the website. Simple!” Not quite.\n\nMany communities struggle with regular updates. People simply get busy. People\nget distracted. Other priorities in the community take over. If all of your\nnews gets posted by one person, and that person decides to spend evenings\nredecorating a house instead, you lose. When people get busy, they tend to\ndrop nonessential and nonfun tasks. News updates are often one of these first\ncasualties.\n\nSo divide this work among a number of contributors. Find three or four people\nwho are happy to update the news site, and talk to one another about what news\nyou are going to post.\n\nGreat Contributors Create Great Content\n\nIt is always important to build out a set of contributors who can bring real\nvalue to your website. As an example, O’Reilly’s Radar site started out as Tim\nO’Reilly’s personal pulpit, but then expanded as he found other people inside\nthe company who had interesting things to say along the same lines, and\neventually people outside the company, too. A lot of people are posting to\nRadar now, but each is personally chosen and vetted.\n\nNaturally, they don’t all have the same opinions and viewpoints, but each one\nin a way conveys a message that technology is interesting and should be\napproached with enthusiasm, along with care and a willingness to challenge. We\nwant to try to accomplish the same goals with our community websites, too.\n\n## Building Conversation\n\nPosting news is one way to keep a website current. There is, however, another\napproach to keeping your site alive: _conversation_. The Internet has become\nan incredible place to have conversations. Countless forums, websites, and\nblogs have provided a medium in which anything and everything can be\ndiscussed. You should ensure that your website is in on the action.\n\nConversation and commenting facilities are an incredible way to make visitors\nfeel that they have input into the community. These facilities are typically\nfairly simple: a blog or news entry is posted, and readers can leave a comment\nunderneath the content to share their thoughts. This has two benefits:\n\nRegular content\n\n    \n\nConversation is content that other people provide to your website. Your\nvisitors will come back to participate in the conversation, and your website\nwill always be fresh and full of new and interesting things to read.\n\nEngagement\n\n    \n\nAllowing any visitor to the website to post an opinion or comment is an\nincredible statement about engagement. Providing this facility says to all of\nyour visitors that your site is open and always welcoming comments.\n\nThese two features in themselves are justification enough for having these\nfacilities on your website, but there is one reason that is even more\nimportant: _community_.\n\nIf you allow people to participate on your website, building a reputation tied\nto their name, community will thrive on your website. Community growth is our\nend game, and growth happens around conversations.\n\nI have experienced this in a number of places, with the most personal being my\nown website at <http://www.jonobacon.org/>. For a number of years I have had\ncomment facilities on my site, and over the years I have developed a regular\nreadership that comes back to contribute to the topics of the posts. If this\nis possible on an individual’s website, just imagine what is possible on a\ncommunity’s website!\n\nKeeping the Conversation Flowing\n\nProviding commenting facilities is only the beginning of growing community on\nyour website. To do this you will need to be more proactive than normal in\nencouraging conversation. Here are some quick tips:\n\n  * Be responsive. View every comment to your website as seeking a response. Respond and ask questions to keep the comments coming in.\n\n  * Write news that generates discussion. In your news items, you should explicitly ask for feedback and responses.\n\n  * Be thankful. Regularly thank your contributors for great comments and feedback.\n\n  * Reward the regulars. You should think carefully about how to reward your regular contributors. One approach I have taken with my own blog is to give the top three contributors a gift, such as a DVD or book. This shows people that you really care about their participation.\n\nAt the beginning of growing your community, you will need to be proactive, but\nas conversation within the community grows, you can take a step back.\n\n## Getting Online\n\nFortunately, you don’t need to have super-technical skills to get a great\nwebsite with conversation facilities up and running. There are a number of\npreexisting tools that will do the job perfectly. The easiest method of\ngetting going is to use a _blogging engine_.\n\nA blogging engine is a software tool that lives on a website and provides a\nsimple interface for you to publish an article. You can use an editor to\nformat the article in different ways (make parts bold, italic, or underlined,\nprovide different headings, links, or images, etc.), and you can also split\nthe posts into different categories. These systems do not require any\nprogramming abilities.\n\nThere are many free online services for setting up blogs, and with them you\ncan get up and running quickly. They allow you to publish your blog entries\nand ensure that they are indexed by popular search engines, such as Google.\nUnfortunately, many of these services don’t allow you to have your blog at\nyour own web address.\n\nIf you would prefer the blog to be on the same domain as your website, you can\ninstall your own blogging engine. There are many free and commercial blogging\nengines available, but I recommend [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).\nWordPress offers an excellent, easy-to-use, and powerful framework for\npublishing content easily. To install your own WordPress website, you will\nneed to have your own server, which you can purchase from a hosting company.\nThe company will provide a place to install the software, and you can set it\nup. Many hosting companies also offer preinstalled WordPress, Drupal, and\nother systems.\n\nRolling Your Own Versus Using a Preexisting Engine\n\nWhen the need for a new website arises, some people prefer to install an\nengine such as WordPress, and some prefer to write a site from scratch.\n\nI highly recommend that, where possible, you use a preexisting engine. Years\nago I wrote my own website engine, and it just wasn’t as good as something\nsuch as WordPress. It’s fairly simple to see why: a project such as WordPress\nhas hundreds of developers creating new features and fixing problems. This\nnets more functionality and a more stable experience in general.\n\nIf you really feel the need to have your own custom website, ensure that you\nhave the resources to maintain it for a long time. When you invest in that\nwebsite today, you will need to be able to still invest in its maintenance in\na year, in two years, or more. Think carefully about this decision: if you go\nwith a preexisting engine such as WordPress, that maintenance is done for you.\n\n### Syndication\n\nIn the past five years there has been a change in how people access content on\nthe Internet. Traditionally, the only way you could get updates from a website\nwas to repeatedly visit the website to check for new content or features. This\nmeant having a number of bookmarks in your web browser and cycling through\nthem hunting for updates. Fortunately, a solution to this problem has been\ndeveloped, known as _syndicated feeds_. Once the forte of the techie, they are\nnow popular across the Internet.\n\nWhen you use a blogging website engine (such as WordPress), each time you add\na new entry, a special feed will be updated with the content. This feed sits\non the same website. Your readers can then use a piece of software called a\n_feed reader_ to subscribe to the feed.\n\nAs an example, on my website at <http://www.jonobacon.org/>, I have a feed\navailable at <http://www.jonobacon.org/feed/>. This is a Really Simple\nSyndication (RSS) feed.\n\n### Note\n\nA good introduction to these feeds is on the BBC website at\n<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3223484.stm>.\n\nWith most websites providing these feeds, you can subscribe to a number of\nyour favorite websites in your feed reader. Each time you load the reader, it\nwill check each feed for updates and indicate if there is new content. Not\nonly is this a hugely efficient way to read lots of websites, but also the\nfeeds typically don’t include all of the website imagery and design. This\nmeans you just get the content and don’t have to download all the other fluff.\n\nYou should ensure that your website provides these feeds. Most engines (such\nas WordPress, Drupal, Joomla!, and others) provide support for these feeds by\ndefault, making it really easy to include this functionality on your website.\n\nSyndication feeds also allow people to take your content and merge it into\ntheir own website. This has been happening more and more in recent years.\nTools can easily embed feeds into the sidebar of a website, for example.\n\nThere is also a new kind of website appearing called a _planet_. These\nwebsites take a number of syndication feeds about related subjects and show\nthe posts in the correct order. This produces a rolling collection of\ninteresting content: readers simply visit the planet and then read a large\nnumber of related websites that they were probably unaware of. A great example\nof this is [Planet Ubuntu](http://planet.ubuntu.com).\n\nYou should seek to get your feed syndicated to these other sites. It can drive\nsome incredible traffic to your site and get your words out farther afield.\n\nSearch Engine Optimization\n\nA popular buzzword in the online world is _search engine optimization_ (SEO).\nIt is the science of how to ensure that your website appears at the top of\nsearch engines. It is a large and complex science, but I want to give you just\na few quick tips that will get you started:\n\n  * Using preexisting engines can make this easier. When you use a blogging engine, the creators of the engine have likely already thought about optimizing for search engines. This will automatically get you higher rankings.\n\n  * Make sure titles and headings (which factor heavily in searches) are meaningful and contain the words people will look for. It’s OK to have a cutesy title like “Why I’m tired this morning,” but also include some meaningful indicator of the content, such as “...because I finished the Bike for MS research fundraiser.”\n\n  * When posting images inside your news/blog posts, ensure that you specify some text to describe the image. This is done in the `alt` attribute of the image tag. For example:\n        \n        <img alt=\"My Dog\" src=\"dog.jpg\">\n\n  * Comment and conversation facilities will increase your SEO by bringing regular traffic to your website and encouraging links.\n\nThe key to SEO is to have great content that attracts regular traffic. Focus\nyour efforts on getting more people to your website, and your SEO rating will\nflourish.\n\n# The Buzz Cycle\n\nSo far in this chapter we have explored many of the wider considerations for\nbuilding buzz. Before we move on to look at some specific examples, we need to\nlearn the final piece of buzz theory: the _buzz cycle_.\n\nWhenever you build buzz, you execute a set of procedures. When combined, this\nset of procedures ensures that you plan effectively, get as much anticipation\nfor your announcement, and learn from the experience. These steps help frame\nthe best practice involved in buzz making, and they will help you to better\nplan and structure how you get people excited about your community.\n\nThe four stages are:\n\nPlan\n\n    \n\nAt this stage you sit down and build a recipe for what you want to achieve,\nhow you can achieve it, and what is involved.\n\nBuild up\n\n    \n\nInstead of going straight to the main course, why not start with an appetizer?\nBuild up some excitement and mystery before the main event kicks in.\n\nAnnounce\n\n    \n\nThe core of our buzz, this is where we kick it out there.\n\nReview\n\n    \n\nThis includes a postmortem of what we did, and an assessment of what worked,\nwhat didn’t, and how we can improve next time.\n\nMany newcomers to the buzz-building business jump straight to the\nannouncement, with a marginal level of planning. I strongly recommend against\nthis. Buzz is an art form that can net incredible results for your community\nwhen executed correctly, but it can also cause lasting damage if you get it\nwrong. Planning and feedback will keep you with the former. To explain how\neach stage is important, I am going to use the 5-A-Day example that we talked\nabout back in [Chapter 4](ch04.html \"Chapter 4. Processes: Simple Is\nSustainable\") that illustrates the buzz cycle well.\n\n5-A-Day was a project I conceived while watching a program about healthy\neating. In many countries it is recommended that you eat five portions of\nfruit or vegetables as part of a healthy diet. It makes healthy eating an\neasy-to-remember metric that people can factor into their routine, which is a\ncompelling concept.\n\nAround that time, we were very conscious of how we handled our bug list. As\nUbuntu grew as a project, the number of users grew; as such, so did the number\nof reported bugs. Inspired by five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, we\nformed the 5-A-Day initiative to encourage our community to triage or comment\non five bugs a day. The project started and made some incredible progress. Now\nlet’s look at the different buzz stages with this example as an illustration.\n\n## Planning\n\nThe reason buzz requires planning is that, to excite people, you need to know\nyour goals, what tools and resources you need, and how to roll out your plan.\nYou want to squeeze as much juice out of your efforts as possible and get as\nmuch focus and attention on your community as possible. You want maximum\nreturn for your investment in time.\n\nFirst, it is time to sit down and consider the different attributes and\nelements in your buzz initiative. Here are some questions you should have\nanswers for:\n\n  * What outcome do you want to achieve?\n\n  * What medium(s) are you going to use to achieve it?\n\n  * What preparation work needs to occur before you can begin the buildup phase?\n\n  * What other people are involved in the buzz and what are their tasks?\n\n  * What is the timeline for the entire buzz cycle?\n\nThe answers to these questions will give you a firm idea of your goals and how\nyou can achieve them. For plans that involve only you, an awareness of the\nanswers to these questions is enough. If you are going to be working with\nother people, however, you should document the answers. This will ensure that\neveryone is on the same page.\n\nIn the case of 5-A-Day, I was working with my team, Daniel Holbach and Jorge\nCastro. The preparation work involved the development of some technical\nfacilities and tools, some documentation, and a timeline. We had a number of\nconference calls to build the plan, ensure that the requirements were in\nplace, and specify deadlines for each buzz cycle phase.\n\nDeadlines Keep You Alive\n\nMany people hate deadlines. They commit us to specifics. For many, and\nparticularly those who enjoy the free-form nature of community, deadlines are\nunwelcome.\n\nStick with them, though. Deadlines are critical to achieve goals. In this\nchapter our goal is effective buzz. When you have multiple people involved in\na buzz-building exercise, you need to ensure that all participants deliver\ntheir contributions to the project on time.\n\nWhen you apply deadlines, ensure that they are documented somewhere. For my\nteam, we plan the deadlines up front and put them on our shared calendar. This\nis a useful means of reminding you when deadlines are near. The key is to\nensure that deadlines are in a place where you will look. If they are buried\naway in a file or notebook, they are of no use to anyone.\n\n## Buildup\n\nThe next step is when things start to get exciting. This phase brings to mind\nthe often-trumpeted statement, “Some things are better left to the\nimagination.” It’s true.\n\nIn this phase we want to tease people with a taste of what is to come. We want\nto pique their curiosity, tempt their senses, and get people chattering about\nwhat we are up to. When done right, this phase can deliver some riveting and\nmemorable buzz, before you even announce what you are doing.\n\nI also used this technique to announce that I was working on _[The Art of\nCommunity](http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/01/13/announcement/)_. A few days\nbefore I announced the project and the website, I took a screenshot of the\nwebsite and motion-blurred it. I deliberately blurred it so that you could not\nsee what was on the site, but you could just make out the word _Community_.\nUnderneath the screenshot I simply wrote, “ _Wednesday 14th January 2009 @\njonobacon.org_.” A flurry of over 35 comments then appeared, each musing on\nwhat the project could be. Many even tried to unblur the screenshot to see\nwhat was there. An hour before I posted the main announcement, a reader called\nKyran managed to unblur the image and provided a link to the new website.\n\nOn the 5-A-Day campaign, too, we had an interesting idea. Over the week\nbuilding up to the announcement, Daniel; Daniel’s girlfriend, Mimi; Jorge; and\nI each posted photos to our blogs that had us showing symbols with the number\n5 in them.\n\nMy first blog post included the photo in [Figure\n7-1](ch07.html#a_photo_designed_to_build_anticipation_i \"Figure 7-1. I\ndesigned this photo to build anticipation in the 5-A-Day buzz campaign.\").\n\n![I designed this photo to build anticipation in the 5-A-Day buzz\ncampaign.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159255.png.jpg)\n\nFigure 7-1. I designed this photo to build anticipation in the 5-A-Day buzz\ncampaign.\n\n(Although I was clearly trying to look cool in the photo, the world and his\ndog seemed to be mostly amused at the fact that I was watching _Along Came\nPolly_ on my TV in the background. Buzz can sometimes backfire.)\n\nUnderneath the photo, I also pulled some text from Wikipedia about the number\n5 and put it underneath the photograph:\n\n> 5 (five) is a number, numeral, and glyph. It is the natural number following\n> 4 and preceding 6.\n>\n> Five is between 4 and 6 and is the third prime number, after 2 and 3, and\n> before 7. Because it can be written as 2^(2^1)+1, five is classified as a\n> Fermat prime. 5 is the third Sophie Germain prime, the first safe prime, and\n> the third Mersenne prime exponent. Five is the first Wilson prime and the\n> third factorial prime, also an alternating factorial. It is an Eisenstein\n> prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form 3n − 1. It is also\n> the only number that is part of more than one pair of twin primes.\n>\n> Five is conjectured to be the only odd untouchable number.\n\nWhen viewed together, particularly on Planet Ubuntu, the blog posts were\nclearly connected. This started a flurry of discussion about what we could be\nup to.\n\n### Note\n\nBuildup should only be used on genuinely interesting initiatives. Don’t bother\nusing buildup on things that will fail to excite people. As an example,\nbuildup would be great for a new project or initiative, but awful for a change\nin policy in how your community is governed.\n\n## Announce\n\nAt this point in the cycle, there should be some rampant speculation regarding\nthe hints you have been dropping in the buildup. You should be seeing\nsuggestions from the sublime to the ridiculous. Don’t go too far with the\nbuildup, though. Allow just a few weeks before you reveal your mystery with an\nannouncement.\n\nWhen announcing you need to ensure that you answer all of the most immediate\nquestions the speculators have. If after all the buildup you don’t come\nthrough with a smörgåsbord of answers, it will simply cause frustration. You\nwant those riddled with curiosity to be delighted to have their curiosity\nquenched when they hear the news.\n\nThe first step when announcing is to point people to a place where they can\nread, hear, or watch your announcement. You should have a single location to\ndirect people to. For most communities, this is a website. Your goal now is to\nmake the page easy to read.\n\nMost announcements that communities make tend to be posted on their website,\nbut there is an important consideration to bear in mind with web\nannouncements: computer screens are hard to read. Jakob Nielsen, one of the\nworld’s highest regarded usability gurus, wrote about the impact of screen\ntext on readers (<http://www.useit.com/alertbox/whyscanning.html>):\n\n> Reading from computer screens is tiring for the eyes and about 25 percent\n> slower than reading from paper. No wonder people attempt to minimize the\n> number of words they read. To the extent this reason explains users’\n> behavior, they should read more when we get high-resolution, high-scanrate\n> monitors in five years since lab studies have shown such screens to have the\n> same readability as paper.\n\nWith reading on screens known to be more tiring, this behavior naturally\ntranslates to people wanting to read less and scan more. As such, we need to\ndeliver our announcement quickly and effectively.\n\nIt’s important that we put our announcement in the proper perspective: it will\nbe one of hundreds of things the person will read on the Internet that day. We\nneed to stand out. We need to grab the reader’s attention and deliver our\ncontent.\n\nNielsen’s solution to this problem is simple: write half as much. In his\nexcellent article [“Be Succinct! (Writing for the\nWeb)”](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9703b.html), Nielsen recommends three\nguidelines that can help:\n\n  * Be _succinct_ : write no more than 50% of the text you would have used in a hardcopy publication.\n\n  * Write for _scannability_ : don’t require users to read long, continuous blocks of text.\n\n  * Use _hypertext to split up_ long information into multiple pages.\n\nWe are trying to avoid swathes of text. We need to architect our announcement\nso that our readers can skip over parts and get straight to the meat.\n\nLet’s look at an example. Imagine we are writing an announcement to solicit\npapers for a conference on renewable energy. Let’s start with a high suck\nfactor and write an announcement we can tear apart afterward:\n\nCall for Papers Open  \nCranfield Green Alliance is a renewable energy conference that takes place in\nCranfield,  \nBedfordshire. The conference is located at Cranfield University and runs from\n10–12 November  \n2009\\. The conference covers a range of topics including renewable energy,\nalternative  \nlifestyles, green cooking, ecological trends, and more. We are now opening up\nour call  \nfor papers and encourage a variety of environmental professionals to submit\npresentations  \nin their area of expertise. Papers on a range of subjects are welcome and we\nwould  \nencourage you all to submit something soon. The conference attracts a wide\nrange of  \nattendees and exhibitions, and we welcome your involvement in this important\nevent.  \nYour contributions as a visitor or a speaker will be valuable. To submit your\npaper you  \nshould email\n[papers@cranfieldgreenalliance.co.uk](mailto:papers@cranfieldgreenalliance.co.uk)\nno later than 1st October 2009. We look  \nforward to your submissions!\n\nFriends, what we have just experienced is unremarkable, flat, and about as\nexciting as a paint-drying competition. I am sorry I subjected you to that\nparagraph: I realize you will never get those minutes back. Consider it a\nsacrifice for your community.\n\nOK, let’s apply some of the guidance we have discussed so far. Let’s make the\nlanguage exciting and inspirational, break up the paragraph so that it is\neasier to read and scan, and make it succinct and clear. Tighten your seat\nbelts. Here we go:\n\nCranfield Green Alliance Call For Papers Open!  \n  \n10–12 November 2009: Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire, England.  \nLeading the way to define a new future fueled by renewable energy.  \n  \nIncluding exciting and industry-relevant topics such as renewable energy,\nalternative lifestyles,  \ngreen cooking, ecological trends, and more. Leaders of the field bring a great\nopportunity to  \nlearn from the finest minds in the industry.  \n  \nPLAY YOUR PART IN THE REVOLUTION  \n  \nDo you want to get your voice heard? Do you want to help inspire and encourage\na new generation  \nof renewable energy? We thought so. It’s time to submit a paper....  \n  \nSubmit a paper on any relevant green topic and deliver it to an audience of\nover 500 attendees.  \n  \nHOW TO SUBMIT: Send papers to\n[papers@cranfieldgreenalliance.co.uk](mailto:papers@cranfieldgreenalliance.co.uk)\nno later than  \nOctober 1, 2009!!  \n  \nGood luck!\n\nIn this example we performed a number of steps to brighten our announcement.\nThis included:\n\n  * Separating the key parts of the message into separate headings and paragraphs\n\n  * Converting the language to be more rabble-rousing and inspiring\n\n  * Engaging in a rhetorical dialog with the reader by asking questions and clearly showing that the answer was to submit a paper, which is the very aim of the announcement\n\nYour announcement page should pass the elevator test: it should get the reader\nup to speed with what you are announcing within a minute.\n\nLet’s get back to our 5-A-Day example. When we were constructing the 5-A-Day\nannouncement, we produced a page that identified the primary concept of\n5-A-Day, how people could get involved, and what they needed to do. Each\ndifferent piece of information had individual headings, and emphasis was used\nextensively. View the page at <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/5-A-Day> to see the\nprinciples in this section in action—and with a successful outcome.\n\n## Review\n\nPostmortems are hugely valuable in any kind of work, and if you don’t perform\nthem, you _never learn how to improve_. Whether you are evaluating how well\nyou handled a discussion, cooked a meal, taught your kids how to play\nfootball, or built community buzz, a review can uncover great opportunities\nfor improvement:\n\nEfficiency\n\n    \n\nWhen you review your work, it gives you an opportunity to identify areas that\nare inefficient and redundant. You can use these as a basis for improvement.\n\nFeedback\n\n    \n\nGathering feedback from the people who consumed your buzz is a great way to\nsee what they felt worked and what didn’t. This is a great opportunity to get\nfeedback on your writing, structure, and the other concepts throughout this\nchapter.\n\nIdeas\n\n    \n\nWhen any kind of postmortem of an approach occurs, it almost always generates\nnew ideas. These will help future buzz cycles to be more effective.\n\nIn the review phase, revisit the questions you asked in the planning phase and\ncompare the plan with what happened:\n\n  * Did you stick to your aim and communicate it well to others?\n\n  * Did you identify the right outcomes to achieve?\n\n  * Were your chosen mediums the most suitable?\n\n  * Did you prepare effectively?\n\n  * Did you communicate well to others involved in the buzz about what needed to be done?\n\n  * Was your timeline for the buzz cycle accurate? Did you hit your deadlines?\n\nTo make this process effective, you should gather feedback from members of\nyour community. Seek to gather responses from those who will provide you with\nconstructive advice of what worked and what didn’t. Remember, much of the goal\nhere is to identify flaws in your approach. Flaws are nothing to be\nembarrassed about: they are opportunities to do even better next time.\n\nLater in the book, we are going to talk about measuring community, and we will\nbe able to use many of the techniques there to help us review our work.\n\n# Buzz Targets\n\nBuzz needs a target, and that target is the topic you are focusing on. Each\ntime you steal someone’s attention, she needs to know that it was worth it.\nYou want to ensure that when she looks in your direction, she feels it was\nworthwhile.\n\nTo do this, you need to decide what you want to promote. Of course, buzz is an\nongoing process: you will need to bring attention and focus to your community\nmany, many times. Each time you need to ensure that there is a purpose.\nWhether the purpose is announcing the community, attracting new members, or\nanything else, you should ensure that your goals and intentions are clear.\n\nTwo kinds of buzz campaigns are useful in virtually all communities:\n\n  * The initial announcement\n\n  * Ongoing efforts to attract members\n\nWe are going to explore both of these, looking at the four elements of the\nbuzz cycle.\n\n## Announcing Your Community\n\nThe first time you need buzz is when you announce your community. The goal is\nto get the message out among people who can contribute to your community,\npique people’s interest, and get them to learn more.\n\nYour announcement should appear fresh and exciting, and an effective buildup\nphase is particularly important. Earlier I gave examples of the approach to\nannouncing _The Art of Community_ and 5-A-Day; you should consider similar\napproaches.\n\nMultimedia can make an announcement more exciting and memorable. Lawrence\nLessig launched his [Change Congress](http://change-congress.org/) campaign on\n[his blog](http://www.lessig.org/blog/2008/03/change_congress_launched.html)\nby recording a short online presentation in which he narrated the goals of the\nproject. I used a similar technique when I announced my [Severed\nFifth](http://www.severedfifth.com/) project. I recorded an\n[announcement](http://www.severedfifth.com/news/2008/06/severed-fifth-\nlaunched/) and put it online on the day of release. These approaches really\nhelp captivate the viewer.\n\nThe desired outcome with this kind of buzz is to have people visit your\nwebsite and to spread awareness of your community.\n\n### Applying the buzz cycle\n\nPreparation\n\n    \n\nEnsure that you have your website in place, and that all of the key\ninformation about your community and how to get involved is available. You\nshould also ensure that syndication feeds are available. Decide where it’s\nimportant to get mentioned (websites, magazines, personal blogs by leaders in\nthe field, etc.). You can often source a list of places by asking your\ncommunity and identifying related websites and magazines.\n\nBuildup\n\n    \n\nIf you have a preexisting blog or other site where you can post content, you\ncould post “Coming Soon...” messages. If you are setting up a local community,\nyou could put up fliers with the date of the announcement and a web address.\n\nAnnouncement\n\n    \n\nOn the day of the announcement, you should publicize in all the communication\nchannels that make sense. You should provide a short blurb that inspires\npeople to learn about your community and encourage them to visit your website.\n\nReview\n\n    \n\nYou can see where your announcement spreads to and whether you were publicized\nin all the places you hoped. There’s also qualitative feedback: did comments\nand questions show that you described your project clearly? Did the types of\npeople you want respond?\n\n## Attracting Contributors\n\nContributors are at the forefront of what makes a great community. Not only\nare they on the front line, furthering your community in the direction of its\ngoals, but they are also your representatives and spokespeople.\n\nAlthough buzz campaigns can be started to attract contributors, this activity\nshould be seen as an always-present and ongoing promotional effort. Your goal\nhere is to constantly communicate the positive message of your community, its\nachievements, and how people can get involved.\n\nThe greatest communicators of this message are your existing members: you want\nto turn their satisfaction into active promotion for your community. To\nachieve this, your members need to feel proud to be in your community. They\nshould feel a drive and passion for your goals and objectives, and they should\nfeel that they want to spread the word so that others can enjoy the community,\ntoo. A positive community will always generate a positive message and be a\nmagnet for new contributors.\n\nThe first step in achieving this is to build a sense of enjoyment, ease of\ncontribution, and pride in your members. You build this by combining the\nelements discussed in this book: simple processes, effective governance,\ntransparency, and so on. When you get these core attributes right, your\nmembers will thrive on the opportunities and direction your community offers\nthem. You now need to encourage them to share their happiness and drive with\nothers.\n\nTheir own resources and social network are an excellent communication channel\nfor this outreach. Your job is to identify methods via which you can help them\nuse these resources to spread the word about (a) the good work your community\nperforms and (b) why they enjoy being part of it.\n\nFor the former, give them buttons for their websites and blogs. Give them\nposters to print out and put in libraries, in stores, and on lampposts.\nProvide them with email signatures that they can use. Encourage them to set up\nFacebook/MySpace pages and more. Each of these resources should direct people\nback to the community’s website.\n\nTo encourage your members to share their joy of being a part of the community,\nthe key is that the communication focuses on the personal story: you need to\nencourage your members to share what they specifically enjoy about the\nproject. In doing this you resort to the essence of community that we\ndiscussed back at the beginning of the book: _stories_.\n\nStories are a fantastic viral marketing asset. A great story is never told\nonce; it is shared again and again. If your community members share great\nstories about their involvement in the community, the stories will travel far\nand wide and encourage new and unknown people to dip their feet into your\nwaters.\n\nYou should talk about the importance of sharing stories with your members.\nHelp them to understand that on any given day they could talk to someone\nonline, in a coffee shop, or on a train or plane and potentially inspire that\nperson to join the community. This can provide your members with a powerful\nsense of opportunity for bringing people in and will get them involved. You\nshould now augment this discussion with some specific recommendations of viral\napproaches of getting the word out there:\n\nBlogging\n\n    \n\nBlog entries get read, linked, and passed on across the Internet. They are\neasy to create, accessible to all, and permanently archived in search engines\nand often crop up in random searches. Blog entries are also very gratifying\nfor the author, particularly if the readers leave comments.\n\nSocial media\n\n    \n\nIn [Chapter 6](ch06.html \"Chapter 6. Social Media\") we discussed tools such as\nTwitter and Facebook as excellent methods of sharing experiences. Encourage\nyour members to use these facilities as they do their work.\n\nWord of mouth\n\n    \n\nEncourage your members to strike up conversations about your community in\nevery possible scenario. Glorify the most insane and ridiculous cases in which\na story is told and the recipient joins the community. As an example, one time\nI met a guy on the London Underground and told him about Ubuntu. He visited\nthe website and eventually joined and participated in the community. This was\nincredibly satisfying. Share these experiences, and encourage and celebrate\nthem.\n\nInterviews\n\n    \n\nSome of your community members may have the opportunity to be interviewed on\nwebsites, on podcasts, on videocasts, or in magazines. Interview opportunities\nare harder to come by, but encourage your members to ask these publications if\nthey can be interviewed. If you don’t ask, you don’t get!\n\nConference presentations\n\n    \n\nIf you have members who are keen to speak at conferences, encourage them to\nsubmit papers. If you have some experience with this process, you should offer\nthem help and advice on putting together a submission.\n\nMeetings/events/open days\n\n    \n\nEncourage your members to organize meetings and events in which they can tell\ntheir story about the community. When I first got involved in open source, I\norganized presentations and open events at my university to help others\nunderstand how fun and satisfying our community is. All I needed was a room\nand a projector. Planting the idea in the minds of your members is sure to\ninspire someone to organize an event.\n\nAn important element in building buzz to attract contributors is to showcase\ngreat work. I used many of these techniques when I started Severed Fifth and\nprovided a range of website buttons and Severed Fifth posters (many of which\nwere produced by the community). To generate buzz, I organized a campaign for\nfans to put the posters and stickers up in their local area. As part of the\ncampaign, I encouraged typical destinations for the posters such as music\nshops, notice boards, and lampposts, but also showcased some of the wackier\nplaces. I saw examples of Severed Fifth stickers and posters in fish and chip\nshops, on the London Underground, in railway stations, toilet stalls, concert\nvenues, and buses, and even stuck to someone who was sleeping. As I heard\nthese stories, I blogged them and encouraged fans to send me photos that I\ncould put on the blog. The viral nature of the campaign encouraged more people\nto participate.\n\nThis viral marketing approach to building buzz has become the new way to do\nbusiness on the Internet. The idea is simple: you build buzz and encourage the\nconsumers of your buzz to also build their buzz on the same topic. With this\napproach, when you unleash something on this network of viral volunteers, it\nspreads like wildfire. The key here is to have this network available, and\nbuilding that network can require a tremendous amount of energy in helping\npeople to feel engaged, but when they do it will pay dividends in buzz. The\nkey is in making people feel a sense of empowerment and responsibility to\nspread the message.\n\nBuilding Your Buzz Army\n\nAs you grow your community, always be on the lookout for those who have a\npersonality that is attuned to getting people excited about the community and\nthe work it does. While you are taking on a responsibility to build buzz, if\nyou can create a team of people who can also build buzz you will develop a\nmuch more scalable resource for building awareness and excitement about your\ncommunity.\n\nPeople who can build buzz and excitement in a way that is natural and not\nobnoxious are few and far between, so keep your eyes open and your ear to the\nground for these folks and grab ‘em when you can.\n\nAn interesting project that really set the standard for this kind of outreach\nwas the Mozilla Firefox promotional campaign, [Spread\nFirefox](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/).\n\nBack in November 2004, the SilverOrange Canadian web firm was commissioned to\nbuild Mozilla’s website. As part of its work the company produced an\nevangelist application on its intranet to manage the structure and content of\nthe site.\n\nBlake Ross (one of the forefathers of Firefox) conceived the idea that Mozilla\nshould encourage and inspire the global Firefox community to lead the\nmarketing for the launch of the popular browser. One of the people involved in\nthis work was Chris Messina. At the time, Chris was a Firefox community\nmember, keen to see the project get better recognition and more widespread\nfocus. Eventually he would go on to lead the Spread Firefox community\nmarketing project in raising over $220,000 in microdonations to launch Firefox\nto a worldwide audience with an ad in the _New York Times_. As Chris explained\nto me, he remembers the formation of the project well:\n\n> Originally there were probably about 30 of us in this private intranet, but\n> maybe only 10 of us participated in any regular capacity. For me, this kind\n> of work was all new to me—both open source and this kind of semi-anonymous\n> Internet collaboration. It’s not like I’d met anyone on the project\n> personally—in fact, I only happened to find out about it because Steven\n> Garrity had blogged that Mozilla was looking for volunteer designers.\n\nAfter hearing about the project, Chris joined and applied his passion for\nFirefox to the campaign. At the heart of buzz is the ability to think outside\nthe box to spread the word, and Chris intimately remembers the approaches they\nused:\n\n> I think there were a number of important elements of this, and that was that\n> we made it fun to get involved. There was both a spirit of camaraderie and\n> of shared purpose (fighting Microsoft), and with that in mind, people came\n> up with some pretty clever ideas in the forums, contributing concepts,\n> strategies, designs…telling the story of how Firefox made a difference to\n> them. We worked hard to promote these efforts through things like the\n> leaderboard (which measured the week-to-week growth in downloads from\n> different affiliate links) and had, I believe, weekly contests or\n> initiatives. Probably the most effective tool was the cumulative download\n> counter…every time we hit a new milestone I would design new artwork to\n> commemorate our success—with each design getting more and more insane.\n\nThe efforts of the Spread Firefox team were exceptional: Firefox 3 was\ndownloaded over 28 million times in 24 hours when it was released. The project\nhas gone on to secure a global user base and a reputation for quality, and a\nthriving and active community that surrounds it.\n\n### Note\n\nPart of the responsibility of finding members is also going to involve finding\nleaders. We will discuss this in [Chapter 10](ch10.html\n\"Chapter 10. Governance\").\n\n### Applying the buzz cycle\n\nPreparation\n\n    \n\nYou should fully research which mediums you want to spread your buzz to. Your\naim here is to identify the kind of personality that will be interested in\njoining your community, and to target the media that they read.\n\nBuildup\n\n    \n\nI do not recommend any buildup to this target. You want to get straight out\nthere and grab contributors.\n\nAnnouncement\n\n    \n\nThe announcement should take place in a variety of media. Your aim here is to\nshare and inspire people in the achievements and accessibility of your\ncommunity. Sell them on the evidence: show them third-party statements and\nmaterial that firmly demonstrates that your community is a fun and rewarding\nplace to be.\n\nReview\n\n    \n\nNaturally, one measure of success is how many new people sign up or start\nhelping out on committees. You can also try to see how many existing members\nhelped the buzz with their personal statements, and why they were or were not\ncomfortable doing so.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> Oh, we’ve had several times when we’ve had some really bad growing pains.\n> It’s seldom so much about the code not working, as the flow of development\n> not working, and something (often _somebody_) holding things up. And yes,\n> that somebody has sometimes been me, and we’ve had to figure out how to\n> change how we do things so that no single person ends up being that kind of\n> bottleneck.\n>\n> —Linus Torvalds, on Growth\n\nRead the [full interview](ch14.html#linustorvalds \"Linus Torvalds, Linux\") in\n[Chapter 14](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case Book\").\n\n# Building Alliances\n\nGood communication resources and contacts are critical for promotional ideas\nand concepts to flow from you to the outside world. If you are going to build\nsome great buzz, you need to know how to communicate effectively in different\nchannels. This requires two skills, which must be mastered separately for each\nchannel:\n\n  * Find the opportunity to make use of that channel. As an example, if you want to be featured in a particular magazine, you need to create an opportunity in which you can get your content there. This almost always involves building contacts. You should get to know the editors of the magazine and build a relationship that could allow you to feature some content in their channel.\n\n  * Ensure that your buzz in that channel is appropriate. The norms of communication between different mediums vary, but the differences can often be subtle and unwritten. If you act outside the expected boundaries (particularly in volunteer channels), it can impact negatively on your community.\n\n### Note\n\nAlso don’t forget the old saying, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”\nIf you have contacts who can help get your message out there or who can put\nyou in touch with those who can help, go ahead and ask.\n\nBuzz is designed to be consumed by lots of people. You want as much focus and\nattention on your community as possible. The more relevant eyeballs there are,\nthe better.\n\nAs part of your planning stage for a buzz campaign, you should weigh the\namount of effort involved with the number of relevant eyeballs. You want to\nensure that your time and effort preparing materials and content is worthwhile\nand that a reasonable number of people see your work.\n\nMuch of this boils down to readership, and readership varies tremendously.\nSometimes you can ask for this information, such as with magazines, but\nsometimes it is more of a guess. There will be some resources that you will\nassume have a large audience (such as a very popular website) and some not so\nlarge (such as a blog).\n\nAn important consideration in this area is how the growth of the Internet has\nchanged audience figures. It used to be general wisdom that paper publications\nwere always the source of high audience figures. This is often no longer the\ncase, as many websites—even a number of blogs—have hundreds of thousands of\nregular visitors.\n\n## The Professional Press\n\nThe professional press is a large and extensive channel. It encompasses\nmagazines, websites, journals, videos, multimedia content, and more. Each\npublication has professional paid staff who have a responsibility to publish\nquality content.\n\nThe professional press has three primary concerns at the forefront of its\nmind:\n\nQuality content\n\n    \n\nFirst and foremost, the professional press wants to produce leading content.\nIt wants well-produced content that is of interest to its audience.\n\nReadership/audience\n\n    \n\nProfessional publications rely on readership numbers. It is these numbers that\nlargely justify the continuation of the publication. Having high audience\nnumbers depends on getting the previous item in place: quality content.\n\nAdvertising opportunities\n\n    \n\nMost publications make a significant chunk of their revenue from advertising,\nand advertising does have an impact on content. Although many publications\nwould deny it, advertising deals are often struck based on relationships\nbetween the publication and the company. These relationships need to be\nmaintained to continue to bring in revenue. In many cases the content in a\npublication may be heavily critical of a company, product, or initiative.\nAlthough this _should_ never matter, for many publications it does, and the\nproducer of the content is advised to either change the content or focus on\nother topics.\n\nYou should factor these attributes into your plan for building buzz. You want\nto target the most appropriate publications that are relevant to your\ncommunity. You will need to provide them with quality content that is of\ninterest to their audience and consider any potential advertising conflict.\n\nYou will need to build a relationship with the publication. With these\npublications largely staffed by paid personnel, it is entirely reasonable to\nformally contact them via email or phone and ask them if you can contribute\nsome content. A great first step would be to ask if they could feature your\ncommunity in their news section. In some cases you may have the chance to\nbuild some relationships that you can return to when opportunity strikes\nlater.\n\nThe first time I experienced this was years back at the start of my career. It\nwas my first time at the Linux Expo in London. I was there running an\nexhibition stand for the first time for the KDE project. While there, I went\nto an after-show party, and the editors from _Linux Format_ magazine were\nthere. I got to chatting with them, had more than a few drinks, and a little\nwhile later asked them if they would consider publishing something by me. Nick\nVeitch, editor at the time, responded with, “Sure, write something, but if it\nis rubbish we won’t publish it.” I wrote my article, it got published, and so\nstarted my journalism career.\n\n_Linux Format_ opened many doors for me, but most importantly, it gave me a\nplatform to talk about things I considered interesting. It opened up a set of\nopportunities that have since helped with building buzz and promotion in the\nopen source projects I have been involved in.\n\nThough it’s been some years since my days writing for _Linux Format_ , I got\nin touch with then staff writer and now editor-in-chief Paul Hudson to gather\nsome insight from the perspective of an editor to share with you all. Paul is\na firm believer of the have-a-go approach to getting content in:\n\n> Both of us got into the world of free software journalism by saying, “Hey,\n> why don’t I write for you?” and I think that same situation occurs a\n> lot—people don’t realize how much they can contribute until they just ask.\n>\n> I think people imagine some sort of incredible vetting process must take\n> place in order to write for magazines—as if only people in smoking jackets\n> with Ph.D.s from the School of Ignorant Snobbery are able to get stuck into\n> writing, but that’s simply not true. Well, not _always_ true, at least!\n> Technical magazines and websites are crying out for people to get involved\n> and just share what’s cool and what’s new in their world.\n\nPaul regularly handles a slew of wannabe writers and passionate community\nmembers keen to get their projects featured in the magazine. With this in\nmind, he offers some useful guidance for improving the likelihood of getting\ncoverage in magazines:\n\n> Don’t use email. We get stacks of emails, and most of them remain unread.\n> The reason for this is that PR agencies blast us with all sorts of emails\n> about things whether they are relevant to the magazine or not, so inevitably\n> some important emails get lost in the mess.\n>\n> Instead, call first, ask to speak to the news editor or someone else on the\n> team, and just have a chat with them. They want good contacts as much as you\n> do, so if you’re someone who represents a project that’s on their radar,\n> they would love to be in touch with you. They are also much more likely to\n> read your emails if you’ve already made contact by phone.\n>\n> When you write release announcements, make it really clear what’s new. This\n> is something the GNOME project, as one such example, does well\n> (<http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.24/#rnusers>). They list the\n> new features with pictures so that someone can decide at a glance whether\n> it’s worth looking into.\n>\n> If you are a software project, provide at least one screenshot that shows\n> off the best feature you’ve got to offer. Remember, these guys are looking\n> for “wow” things to print, and if you can send them a shot of your software\n> looking awesome, they are much more inclined to run it as a news story.\n>\n> Remember that even in technical magazines, some people are still journalists\n> first and geeks second. Put your documentation online and link to all the\n> technical information you like, but when you’re trying to get a journalist\n> interested in what you have to say, it’s much more important to say,\n> “MyProject 2.0 uses 25% less RAM than MyProject 1.0” than to say, “The\n> switch to the xyz toolkit blah blah blah please send me straight to your\n> Trash folder.” Sure, drop in all the technical information you want later\n> on, but you need to win them over in the first two sentences by focusing on\n> what really kicks ass in your software.\n>\n> If you’re not producing software, getting into magazines is slightly\n> trickier, because magazines rarely want to print a story if it’s similar to\n> something else they ran recently. So if your user group wants to get\n> featured, you need to step outside the installfest (unless it’s _big_) and\n> do something pretty darn special. Whatever you do, take a photo and make it\n> available under a Creative Commons license that allows commercial use.\n>\n> The rules change with nontechnical magazines because once you enter the\n> mainstream, you need to focus more on people. The _New York Times_ won’t\n> find the Gecko web rendering engine interesting, but it will find Spread\n> Firefox interesting because grassroots marketing really is changing the\n> browser landscape.\n\nWhile Paul offers some useful advice on the best-practice methods of getting\ncontent in the hands of editors, he is keen to emphasize that many communities\nsimply don’t get out and try, and this makes for a huge opportunity for\nprinted nirvana:\n\n> Let me try to make this a bit clearer with a specific example from _Linux\n> Format_. We run a page of LUG information every month, and we have to email\n> people to try to get content to fill those pages, despite printing an open\n> plea every issue asking people to get in touch.\n>\n> So it’s not that community members are struggling to get their information\n> in—it’s more that many of them just aren’t trying. Perhaps they think we’re\n> not interested. Perhaps they think we won’t print it. But as they so rarely\n> try, most of them will never know.\n>\n> Maybe they’re just targeting magazines that are just a little bit out of\n> their reach, but that’s another schoolboy error—Editor X is much more likely\n> to print an article about your community if Editors Y and Z already have. So\n> start small; find a magazine that fits your niche closely and get yourself\n> covered in there. Then use that to help get coverage in other places,\n> building it up bit by bit.\n\nThe professional press can seem a bit unnerving. Professional journalists\noften feel like a live-by-the-seat-of-your-pants collection of hard-working,\nfocused, and unrelenting writers. Don’t let this worry you. Journalists are\ngood people and they get asked for content opportunities all the time. Just go\nout there and ask.\n\nWhen I started doing this, I would ask everyone. I would email 10 or 15\nmagazines to see if I could contribute content. I would not spam them: each\nemail would be focused on that specific publication, and each would be\nrelevant to my topic.\n\nI recommend that you email a list of topics you can write about and ask if you\ncould write something about those topics. Alternatively, write an article and\nsubmit it. The benefit of the latter is that the journo has direct access to\ncontent, which is often an attractive proposition. Just go out there and ask;\nthere really is no harm.\n\n## The Amateur Press\n\nIn the past five years, the amateur press world has exploded. The Internet has\nprovided an incredible medium in which anyone can write about anything and\nhave the chance to grow an audience. Technology and open access to information\nhave provided an incredible opportunity to be heard, and many have built new\nreputations out of these opportunities. Consequently, millions of blogs and\nthousands of podcasts have sprung up around the world.\n\nThe amateur press is a world largely fueled by volunteers. The authors write\ntheir words not to claim a paycheck, but to share their ideas, perspectives,\nand opinions. Although the amateur press is populated by amateur scribes, this\ndoes not necessarily equate to a lack of quality. Some of the greatest work I\nhave ever read has shown up on a blog. This could be the musings of Lessig on\nthe copyright wars (<http://www.lessig.org/blog/>) or the deeply amusing yet\nincredibly well-written and inspired political blather of\n[Flyingrodent](http://flyingrodent.blogspot.com/). Both are inspired works,\nyet very different in content and presentation.\n\nThe timeline of the amateur press revolution largely matched that of the\nprofessional press revolution many years earlier. The publishing world\nexploded onto the scene and thousands of books, newspapers, and journals\nsprung up. Each of these publications had its own perspective on its\nrespective topic, and it became very difficult for readers to identify where\nthe real quality was. The solution to this was the launch of other\npublications that read, reviewed, and collated this content (a great example\nbeing [_The Week_](http://www.theweek.com/)).\n\nWe have started to see much of this in recent years with blogs and podcasts.\nWebsites such as [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) have been sifting\nthrough the blogosphere and identifying the most popular and interesting\nblogs. Well-respected members of given communities will also often provide\ntheir _blogroll_ , which lists the blogs they enjoy reading. These resources\nall provide an excellent opportunity to identify which blogs you should be\nfocusing on.\n\nThe amateur press is hugely important for buzz. The professional press is far\nmore complicated and restricted in terms of getting heard, whereas often a few\nemails exchanged with the amateur press will net great results.\n\nIt’s not surprising why:\n\n  * The amateur press has a shared appreciation for volunteer community. They understand your reasons and intentions and will often want to promote them.\n\n  * There is no advertising conflict in most of the amateur press: they can write about whatever they want.\n\n  * There is typically no limitation on content. On a blog you can write as many posts as you like. This opens up more opportunities for you to get in on the content.\n\nThe most significant mediums in the amateur press arena are blogs, podcasts,\nand videos. Let’s take a quick look at all three and explore their cultures.\n\n### Blogs\n\nWeblogs (typically known as blogs) started out life as online diaries. In them\npeople would share what they were doing, what they were thinking, and what\ninterested them. When blogging started, there were few blogs, and most were\ndevoted to deeply technical topics.\n\nAlan Cox was one of the earliest bloggers that I am aware of. Living in\nSwansea in Wales, Alan developed his celebrity among early Linux fans due to\nhis work on the Linux kernel. Alan worked on incredibly low-level deep and\ndirty programming. It was about as unrelentingly hardcore as you could get.\n\nWhen I first started reading his diary, I was fascinated. This was not the\nwork of Alan Cox communicated through a journalist’s eyes. What I was reading\nwere the direct thoughts of the man himself. Without wishing to sound like an\noverenthusiastic psychology major, I felt like I was actually closer to the\nperson I was reading about. It gave a direct line to his world, and it pretty\nmuch rocked mine.\n\nSince then, blogging has expanded somewhat. In addition to blogs being used as\npersonal diaries, many are now referred to as _personal publishing systems_.\nMany people, myself included, instead use blogs as a means of writing articles\nthat are of interest to them. I use my blog to write about community, music,\ntechnology, usability, and more. I also use it as a medium to express\nachievements, goals, and more.\n\nIt is entirely conceivable that both your existing community members and the\npeople you want to have as friends have blogs. With this in mind, blogging\nshould be a critical component in your buzz building.\n\nThe first task is to know which blogs to build buzz with. Look for relevant\nblogs and strike up a relationship with the authors. Explain what your\ncommunity is doing, and what your goals are. Try to get the author on board\nwith your mission. You can then ask whether the author would be interested in\nsharing your work on his blog. If you have your own blog, you could offer to\nprovide a link to his blog in exchange.\n\n#### Blog wars\n\nAlthough blogging has had a hugely positive impact on how people can\narticulate and share opinions and perspectives, there has been a dark side.\nBlogging has also become a medium in which much overzealous opinion can\nsometimes be expressed a little _too_ quickly. Unfortunately, I have a rather\nembarrassing example of someone who fell into this trap: yours truly.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. There used to be a company called Lindows that\nmade a version of Linux that shared many visual and operational similarities\nto Windows. Microsoft frowned at the name “Lindows,” and a fight started\nbetween the companies to change the name. Lindows initially resisted, but\nafter mounting pressure, it changed its name to Linspire.\n\nNow to the issue. Let me take the liberty to explain in the words of the\n[article](http://onlamp.com/pub/wlg/7723?page=last):\n\n> Recently a chap named Andrew Betts decided to take the non-free elements out\n> of Linspire and release the free parts as another Linspire-derived\n> distribution called Freespire. This act of rereleasing distributions or code\n> is certainly nothing new and is fully within the ethos of open source. In\n> fact, many of the distributions we use today were derived from existing\n> tools. Unfortunately, Linspire saw this as a problem and asked for the\n> Freespire name to be changed.\n>\n> Reading through the notice of the change, the language and flow of the words\n> screams marketing to me. I am certainly not insinuating that Betts has been\n> forced into writing the page, or that the Linspire marketing drones have\n> written it and appended his name, but it certainly doesn’t sound quite right\n> to me. I would have expected something along the lines of “Freespire has\n> been changed to Squiggle to avoid confusion with the Linspire product”, but\n> this is not the case. Instead we are treated to choice marketing cuts such\n> as “To help alleviate any confusion, I contacted Linspire and they made an\n> extremely generous offer to us all”. Wow. What is this one-chance-in-a-\n> lifetime-not-sold-in-stores offer? Luckily, he continues, “they want\n> everyone who has been following my project to experience ‘the real’\n> Linspire, FOR FREE!!!”. Now, pray tell, how do we get this “real” version of\n> the software “FOR FREE!!!”?\n>\n> “For a limited time, they are making available a coupon code called\n> ‘FREESPIRE’ that will give you a free digital copy of Linspire! Please visit\n> <http://linspire.com/freespire> for details.” Oh...thanks.\n\nI gave Linspire a pretty full-throated kick in the wedding vegetables in my\nblog entry. I told the story, objected to what I considered hypocrisy given\ntheir own battle with similar-sounding trademarks, and vented. I wish Guitar\nHero had existed back then. It would have been a better use of my time.\n\nI was wrong to jump to conclusions and write so preemptively. Shortly after\nthe article was published, then-CEO Kevin Carmony emailed me. He was not a\nhappy bunny. His objection, and it was valid, was that I flew off the handle\nwithout checking in with him first. My blog entry was my first reaction. The\nhappy conclusion to this story is that I apologized to Kevin and admitted to\nbeing a bit of an arse, and we have remained friends. In fact, a little while\nlater I joined the Linspire Advisory Board shortly before I joined Canonical\nto work on Ubuntu. It’s funny how things work out.\n\nPractice What You Preach\n\nIn this chapter we have discussed the important attributes in setting up a\nwebsite and blog for your project, and also how to build buzz using other\npeople’s blogs.\n\nImportantly, _you personally_ should have a blog. Use it as an opportunity to\ndiscuss your personal interests and to talk about your community.\n\n### Podcasts\n\nPodcasts are audio shows that are distributed on the Internet. They typically\nhave between one and four presenters, and they are often based on fairly\nspecific topics. Many listeners use a special piece of software called a\n_podcatcher_ to subscribe to a podcast so that when new episodes of a podcast\nare released, they are automatically downloaded to a media player such as an\niPod. This is a fantastic way to keep listeners updated with new content.\n\nA significant reason behind the success of podcasts is that they deliver\ninteresting specialist content to the listener to fill those dull minutes\nwhile traveling to work. Many podcasts include interviews, reviews, features,\ndebates, and other content. They vary hugely in both audio and content\nquality, and some podcasts have netted thousands of listeners.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier in this book, I cofounded a podcast with some friends\ncalled LugRadio. The show was very specifically focused on open source and\ndigital rights. It took a lighthearted and irreverent approach to the content,\nand we deliberately focused on making the content social, fun, and amusing.\nEach show presented a range of topics for discussion, and each of us would\nweigh in and share our thoughts, often resulting in raucous debate and\ndiscussion.\n\nPodcasts are always looking for pointers to interesting content and\nannouncements. You should email the presenters and explain what you are\nworking on, and see if they would be interested in featuring your community on\nthe show. If you manage to get a spot on a popular podcast, it could bring a\nwealth of new blood to your community. Although you may feel a little funny\nabout emailing the presenters out of the blue, go ahead! If you don’t ask, you\ndon’t get.\n\nWhen pitching to a podcast, the most important tip is that your tone should\nmatch that of the podcast. When we were doing LugRadio, we would frequently\nget offers for interviews and features, but often the tone would be right out\nof a Marketing 101 textbook. Not only did this demonstrate that the person\nmaking the offer had not listened to the show, but it also was a red flag for\nboring, emotionless content that had no place on LugRadio. On the other hand,\nwe also got offers of content that was fun, loose, and insightful, and these\nwere snapped up instantly.\n\nIf you get accepted for an interview or to have your community featured,\nlisten to a number of episodes of the podcast to get a feel for the tone. Use\nit as a guide, but don’t be afraid to share your own personality: you have the\nopportunity to inspire people to join your community, so just be yourself\nwithin the context of the podcast.\n\nFinally, always ensure that you have a web address to point the listeners to.\nThis will provide an option to feed them more information, and the link can be\nlisted in the podcast’s show notes. Ensure that the website the link points to\nis packed with content that’s ready when the episode of the podcast is\npublished.\n\n### Note\n\nAs a gesture to the makers of the podcast, it is highly recommended that you\nspread the word about the podcast episode that your community is featured in.\nYou could do this on your website, in your community’s communication channels,\nand on blogs. This will help build a strong relationship with the podcast,\nleaving the door open for future content and interviews.\n\n### Videos\n\nOnline video has become increasingly popular as the Internet has become faster\nand more accessible. Although a hefty Internet connection is required to suck\nsaid videos down onto your computer for viewing, the sheer popularity of\nservices such as [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) and\n[blip.tv](http://blip.tv/) has demonstrated that many do indulge in such\naudiovisual delights on the Internet.\n\nWhile some of us may reminisce about the dark days of dial-up Internet access,\nit is important to remember that many parts of the world still rely on slower\ndial-up connections. For these folks, videos are simply not an option. As\nsuch, before you get too excited to step into the shoes of Steven Spielberg,\nyou should consider how accessible videos are for your community. As an\nexample, if you are reaching out to a community in a remote part of Africa,\nyou may want to rely on another lower-bandwidth medium. In general, my\nrecommendation is to make use of video, but not as a primary medium. Instead,\nuse it to complement your other, more widely accessible resources.\n\nBy far the most popular video service at the time of this writing is YouTube.\nThe idea is simple: anyone can upload a video and anyone with a web browser\nequipped with Macromedia Flash can view it. YouTube opened the doors for\nanyone with a webcam or a cheap video camera to be able to create and publish\nonline video. This has resulted in thousands of hours of freely accessible\nvideo hitting the Internet.\n\nThis is only part of the value of YouTube, though. Videos on YouTube are\nhugely discoverable: it is possible to upload a video and have thousands of\npeople stumble across it. This happens because each video on YouTube also\ndisplays a list of videos that are related to the one being viewed. This\nfeature alone hugely increases the likelihood of people finding your videos.\nTo do this you need to ensure that you name and add keywords to describe the\ncontent of your video in a way that enhances the chances of a certain\ndemographic of user being able to find it. As an example, if you are part of a\nmapping community, you might want to tag your video with the words _map_ ,\n_geography_ , _geo_ , _location_ , and any specific regions that were featured\nin the video. It is stunning how many people will find your videos, and this\nis further bolstered by word of mouth and the simplicity of embedding videos\nin web pages.\n\nAnother hugely useful feature of YouTube are _channels_. These are home pages\non YouTube that contain videos from a certain provider (such as an artist,\nactor, or your community). There are different types of channels on YouTube\ndesigned for different types of providers that have additional facilities such\nas custom logos, blog entries, and tour dates. A huge benefit of a channel is\nthat people can subscribe to it and will be notified when you add a new video.\nThis is an excellent way to keep people hooked into your videos.\n\nYouTube channels are something we have used extensively in the Ubuntu\ncommunity. As part of our ongoing efforts to educate and train developers in\nhow to contribute to Ubuntu, we created the Ubuntu Developer Channel [on\nYouTube](http://www.youtube.com/ubuntudevelopers). On the site, we uploaded\ntuition videos, developer interviews, and more. At each Ubuntu Developer\nSummit, we would interview attendees to get updates about their work on the\nnext release and perform question and answer sessions with key community\nmembers. These videos were hugely successful, and many of them gathered\nthousands of views within weeks of going online. The channel has over 1,800\nsubscribers at the time of this writing. YouTube is an excellent resource for\ndelivering education and best practice, and I highly recommend that you make\nuse of it if you have the resources and time.\n\nAnother interesting option for video is live streaming. This is where you\nproduce a live videocast that people can view as it is being recorded at a\nscheduled time. Traditionally, live streaming has always been off-limits for\nmost of us: the bandwidth requirements are so epic that it makes it too costly\nand impractical.\n\nFortunately, there is another option in the form of\n[Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv). The concept is neat: the video you record on\nyour computer with your lower-bandwidth Internet connection is streamed to the\nUstream server, and then your viewers connect there with Ustream’s oodles of\nbandwidth to show your video. This means your viewers don’t hammer your\nInternet connection, and it puts streaming in the hands of us all.\n\nUstream not only provides a simple means of streaming video, but also includes\nother features, such as a live chat channel for the show, and recording,\ntagging, and syndication facilities. The live chat channel is particularly\ninteresting: it provides an opportunity for viewers to interact with the\npresenter as the broadcast is happening. This means a viewer could tune in and\ncomment on the content, and the presenter can read the comment and repeat it\nin the broadcast.\n\nThis is something I first tried around the time I was wrapping up this book.\nWhile experimenting with Ustream, I tested it by broadcasting live from my\nliving room and posting the link to the videocast on Twitter and identi.ca.\nWithin minutes I had 24 people viewing my entirely ad hoc and off-the-cuff\nbroadcast. With my interest piqued, I decided to start performing a regular\nshow called _[At Home with Jono Bacon](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/at-home-\nwith-jono-bacon)_.\n\nWhether you make use of prerecorded or live video, there are some nuggets of\nbest practice that are useful to keep your viewers engaged in your content:\n\n  * Do your best to keep production values high. As an example, if you are recording the video with your laptop’s webcam, consider buying an external microphone. Many of the built-in mics in laptops sound awful and distort easily. Ensure that the location the camera points at looks clean, uncluttered, and professional, and wear clothes that don’t distract the viewer.\n\n  * Before you produce your video, make some notes about what you will discuss. The easiest way do this is to make a series of bullet points with the topics you want to feature. If you are nervous, you may want to write a script, but I highly recommend that you don’t. Unscripted content that is delivered well is far more natural and engaging.\n\n  * If possible, have more than one presenter. Multiple presenters always make for more interesting shows because there is an opportunity to bounce off each other with conversation, spark up debate, or play specific roles (e.g., the teacher and the learner).\n\n  * When creating an educational program (such as a tuition video), consider embedding in the video the focal point of the tuition (e.g., the computer screen if a programming video) or slides. There are many free tools that can capture computer screen content to video to help with this, such as [Screencast-O-Matic](http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/), [Wink](http://www.debugmode.com/wink/), and [recordMyDesktop](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/).\n\n  * YouTube and Ustream allow you to put notes next to your video. This is an excellent place to list the topics you are covering in the video, provide links to websites, and credit those involved in the content and creation of the video.\n\n  * Consider the licensing of your content before you release it. I always recommend that you license your video under a [Creative Commons license](http://www.creativecommons.org/). You should also consider the licensing of third-party content. As an example, if you want to use the latest U2 tune in your video, you might not be able to legally use it, or if you can, you may need to cough up some royalties. Be very careful here: although it is tempting to just go ahead and use the song, many online video producers have been busted for copyright infringement. I always recommend that you play it safe and only use properly licensed content for your needs.\n\n  * Finally, you should be aware that at the time of this writing the Macromedia Flash plug-in that many video websites use (including YouTube and Ustream) is closed source. Some proponents of software freedom and open source may refuse to view those videos for this reason. If this is likely to be problematic, it is recommended that you also provide access to your videos in an entirely free format, such as [Ogg Theora](http://theora.org/).\n\nWe only have space here to delve into a few tasty morsels of best practice, so\nif you are interested in making videos it is recommended that you buy a\ndedicated book on the topic. This will help you get up and running quickly.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> There’s definitely an oversaturation of content on the Internet and on\n> YouTube now, so it’s harder than ever to get noticed and break out. I would\n> recommend ignoring all “overnight successes”—you can’t predict that or what\n> will go viral; there’s nothing to learn there.\n>\n> —Mark Bussler, on Content\n\nRead the [full interview](ch14.html#markbussler \"Mark Bussler, Classic Game\nRoom\") in [Chapter 14](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case Book\").\n\n# Events and Conferences\n\nEvents and conferences can be really valuable targets for growing buzz and\nexcitement about your community. Depending on what kind of community you are\npart of, there are often events happening locally and farther afield that are\nrelated to your community and the wider topic your community is interested in.\nAs an example, from my career, open source has taken me to events all over the\nworld, ranging from formal business conventions to open source and science\nfiction crossover events (and _believe me_ , the latter is to be seen to be\nbelieved).\n\nAside from being useful, events are just a whole lot of fun, too. You get to\nmeet interesting people, further your community, and maybe even see a new part\nof the world. Many of us love to travel, so it makes perfect sense to get out\nthere on the road and not only further your community, but also have a great\ntime doing it.\n\nUnfortunately, this fun comes at a cost. While online buzz building is pretty\ncost-effective, going to events can get expensive, particularly if you don’t\nhave a company paying for it. Conference tickets, hotel rooms, plane tickets,\nfood and drinks, and other costs all add up. Before you know it, that $50\nconference ticket can easily balloon to $500 or more when you add in all the\nother costs of getting there and back home. Things can also get pretty costly\nwhen you are surrounded by many people who are there courtesy of their company\nand you need to pay out of your own pocket to join them at nice restaurants,\nbars, lunch spots, and more.\n\nEven if you have a company sponsoring your attendance, events are costly when\nit comes to your time. As we discuss in [Be Wary of Too Much\nTravel](ch13.html#be_wary_of_too_much_travel \"Be Wary of Too Much Travel\"),\nthe cost of your time away from your community while you go to the conference\nor event can add up, and if you are traveling a lot, the impact of the travel\non your personal life can also cause stress. I have been in the position of\ntraveling too much, and believe me, while it may be fun for you for a while,\nit will wear you down at some point, particularly if you have a partner or\nfamily.\n\nYou definitely want to get out there and visit some events, but you also want\nto ensure that you pick your events carefully and get the most out of the ones\nyou do attend.\n\n## Choosing Events\n\nIn 2011 I moved a member of my team to focus on a different kind of community.\nTraditionally, Jorge had been coordinating relationships with other open\nsource projects and how they interfaced with Ubuntu, but there was an\nincreased focus on a new Ubuntu technology called _Juju_. We wanted to build\nsome community growth and outreach around it, and with this in mind I moved\nJorge into a new position as our cloud community liaison.\n\nPart of this role was going to involve getting Jorge out to events to speak\nabout Juju, explain what it is, how it works, how to use it, and how attendees\nof those events can create _Charms_ (technical contributions that make\ndifferent cloud services work with Juju).\n\nWith this change I was first faced with a resourcing challenge. At the time,\nthe cloud was an incredibly hot technology and there were literally hundreds\nof events happening every year in the cloud space. Obviously we could not send\nJorge to them all; even if we had the travel resources to send him, we would\nbreak his gentle soul with such a brutal and constant stream of airplanes,\nhotels, and those small bags of peanuts airline staff give you. As such, we\nneeded to pick which events we wanted him to attend, and pick wisely.\n\nWith this in mind I asked Jorge to put together a spreadsheet that listed all\nthe events that could be interesting for us to attend. The focus of this list\nwas clear: these need to be cloud events and oriented around technology (as\nopposed to business events) and DevOps (the audience we were focusing on). I\nasked Jorge to gather this list of events and to determine the following\ncharacteristics for each one:\n\n  * Location and venue\n\n  * Date(s) of the event\n\n  * Typical attendance size\n\n  * Number of sessions and average talk audience size\n\n  * Team priority\n\nEach of these pieces of information helped to provide an overview of each\nevent and its respective details. The location and dates were useful in terms\nof logistical planning (e.g., it is cheaper to fly to certain locations). The\naudience and session size gave us an idea of how many people we could reach\nout to, and if Jorge got a speaking slot, how many people were likely to be in\nthe audience.\n\nThe team priority was a general perspective of how the other members of the\nJuju team saw the priority of the different events. Even though I was going to\nbe approving and rejecting these events from a resourcing perspective, I knew\nI didn’t have the best insight into the value of many of these events (as I\nhad not attended most of them). This is why I wanted an idea of team priority;\nit would help us to consolidate the team’s expertise into the resourcing\nprocess.\n\nThe next step was to discuss each event and determine how well it served our\nneeds in the following areas:\n\nBuzz opportunity\n\n    \n\nHow much opportunity is there to spread the word about Juju? Is the audience\nlikely to be interested? Are there social events that we can spread our\nmessage to in addition to the conference? Are there cobranding and sponsorship\nopportunities? What talks, panels, lighting talks, and other events can we be\na part of?\n\nNetworking\n\n    \n\nWho is going to be there and are there people going who we want to have\nconversations with? Are there strategic networking goals that we can achieve\nat this event?\n\nEducation\n\n    \n\nWhich presentations and tutorials are at the event that could be useful for\nskills acquisition and growth?\n\nThe final step was to apply each of these elements to our list of events and\nbalance this with our budget. This gave us a solid prioritized list of events\nfrom which we could get the most value.\n\nI recommend that you use the same process when assessing events for your\ncommunity. Have a clear idea of your resources (whether it is $50 or $5,000)\nand identify which events make the most sense to attend and where you will get\nthe most value.\n\nOne temptation to resist is to pick events because they are “cool”; many so-\ncalled “cool” events don’t offer a lot of value for you and your community.\nInstead, focus on what you can use to enhance and grow your community and how\nmuch return you can get for the money you invest in getting there.\n\nDetermining The Value Of An Event\n\nThe _value_ of an event can vary tremendously based on the kind of community\nyou are building and whether you work for a company.\n\nAs an example, the value derived from a local book club attending an event\ncould be getting more members involved and more books donated. As such, the\nlevel of financial investment in attending the event would need to be low due\nto the grassroots nature of the group. For a larger funded community (such as\na nonprofit) the required value may be more demanding to justify the\ninvestment of communal funds.\n\nFor a company wanting to work with a community there is sometimes a temptation\nfrom senior management to judge the value of an event based on lead\ngeneration. As a community manager, you may need to articulate the benefits of\nthe event that aren’t related to lead generation in a way that the senior\nexecs will understand better. This can be a complex task. Ultimately, though,\nthe value in a company is typically defined in terms of edging the success of\nthe company forward; just think how you can define the benefits of event\nattendance in this way (e.g., networking, relationships, outreach, comarketing\netc.).\n\n### Submitting your paper\n\nWith your list of target events finalized, you should now see which events you\ncan speak at. Each event should have a website, and on each site there should\nbe a _Call for Papers_ ; this is event-speak for a period of time during which\nyou can propose a presentation at the event. There is usually a form on the\nwebsite or an email address where you can send your proposal.\n\nYou may be thinking, “I guess I just fill in the form and I am good to go,\nright?“ Hold your horses for one second, my friend....\n\nRegardless of how good your presentation might be, if your presentation\nproposal is subpar, it will never get accepted. I have served on some paper\nreview boards at various events and I want to share a few tips regarding what\ncan increase your chances of getting accepted. Just like interviewing for a\njob, there are some good things you can do to improve your chances and some\nhorrible mistakes you can make that will make you screw the pooch.\n\nThe first thing you should do is to ensure that you have all the information\nyou need for the submission. You are going to need the following:\n\nPresentation title\n\n    \n\nYour presentation title should be short, snappy, and interesting. Many people\nwill never read your summary, so the title should get their attention. As an\nexample, instead of “An Overview of Community Governance Processes,” try\n\"Governance: Cat Herding for Fun and Profit.” Make sure your title, while fun,\nstill actually communicates what the talk is about (e.g., \"Raising the\nWaterfowl Revolution\" would not be a good bet, despite my love of ducks).\n\nPresentation summary\n\n    \n\nYour summary should explain the key points your presentation will share. Don’t\ndrown the reader in detail; instead, share the core areas your presentation\nwill cover, and present it like you are telling a story. Also be careful to\nnot big yourself up too much; arrogantly written summaries can be off-putting.\n\nBiography\n\n    \n\nYou should include a speaker biography that is written in the third person\n(e.g. “Bob Smith is a community manager…”). Try to keep this short but\nimpressive. Think of this as your elevator pitch about you; what are your main\naccomplishments, experience, and credentials? Your bio should be read by a\npotential audience member to affirm confidence that you know your subject\nwell. Keep it positive, but again, don’t be arrogant or egocentric.\n\nSpeaking requirements\n\n    \n\nYou should outline what you need for your presentation. Although this may be\nobvious, if you are delivering slides, be sure to specify that you will need a\nprojector and microphone. If you have any A/V requirements (e.g., sound from\nyour laptop), a whiteboard, or other needs, be sure to specify them. Try to\nensure that your speaker requirements just cover the essentials; white doves\nbackstage and your own trailer should be avoided in your requirements list.[4]\n\nPhotos\n\n    \n\nInclude some photos of yourself, taken by a professional photographer. These\nphotos should be at a really high resolution so that they can be included in\nprinted material if required. I recommend that you get some portrait shots of\nyou looking smart and professional.\n\nOnce you've gathered these things, you should write your submission and have a\nfriend or colleague review it before you hit the Submit button. Always ensure\nthat you try to get your submissions in before the deadline.\n\nWith your presentation submitted, now hold your fire and keep your fingers\ncrossed, and wait for the event organizers to get back to you. Whatever you\ndo, don’t pester the event organizers for a decision; wait for them to get\nback to you.\n\n### Note\n\nWhen submitting presentations to events and conferences, be sure you can\nactually attend the event if you get accepted. You should not presume that\naccommodation and travel sponsorship is available, unless outlined on the\nwebsite (and even then you should specify it as a requirement if you can’t\nafford to pay your own way there). Never submit a presentation if you can’t\nguarantee you can join the event if your presentation is accepted; for\nconference organizers this can be frustrating, and you don’t want to tarnish\nyour reputation in the eyes of the event planners.\n\n### Promoting your talk\n\nOnce you get a presentation accepted for an event, the real work begins.\nUnfortunately, many speakers at events get their acceptance email for a\npresentation submission and then never do anything to promote and encourage\npeople to actually attend their session.\n\nAt many events there are multiple presentations going on simultaneously. You\nnot only want to encourage people to attend the general event, but also want\nto encourage people to go to your presentation. A packed presentation room is\na great thing, and that is what we are aiming for here.\n\nAs such, you should start performing some buzz and outreach about your\npresentation in the buildup to the event. Be sure to blog about it in your\ncommunity, use social media to spread the word, mention it in interviews,\nreach out to local user groups where the event is held to encourage them to\njoin, and perform other types of outreach.\n\nOne technique I have found useful is to provide teaser updates and snippets in\nthe weeks before the event that outline some of the topics you will be\ndiscussing. Publicize these over social media and blogging resources, and keep\na regular flow of these little snippets coming to generate excitement and\nmomentum around the presentation.\n\n## Delivering Presentations\n\nWhen I was 17 I gave my very first presentation. It took place at the Linux\nUser Group event that I used to kick off [Chapter 1](ch01.html \"Chapter 1. The\nArt of Community\"). I came armed with a StarOffice presentation that I had\nobsessed over ever since I rather stupidly volunteered to give a presentation.\nI had no idea what a presentation was supposed to look like; it wasn’t like\nthere was a YouTube back then where I could pick up tips…hell, there was\nbarely even an Internet.\n\nSomewhat limited in options, I asked my dad for help. A man of many vocations\n(who should really have a book written about him), he was currently working in\na senior role at a large car sales organization. He was at one with the\npresentation mojo, but his presentations were designed for businesspeople;\nladen with bullet points, overlapping circles, complex diagrams and other such\nfluff. This was a different crowd, but I had no idea what they wanted to see.\n\nI put together my deck and delivered it to the Linux User Group. I wasn’t so\nmuch worried about the delivery (I was a fairly outgoing teen) but more the\nstructure, story, and design of my slides. I really wanted people to _enjoy_\nmy presentation; I didn’t want it to feel like a dorky presentation done by a\npimply teenager (which of course it was). Fortunately, it went pretty well.\n\nThis kick-started years of trial and error in developing my own presentation\nmojo. Over the course of my career, I have seen some brutally awful\npresentations and some stunningly entertaining and thoughtful ones. I have\nalways wanted to be in the latter category, and while I don’t consider myself\nan expert in presentation magic, I have come away with some tips I want to\nshare with you all. Given that this book is called _The Art of Community_ and\nnot _The Art of Presenting_ I don’t want to sidetrack us too far from the\ncommunity path, but delivering great presentations can really excite and\nmotivate people to join your community.\n\nOf course, everyone has his own style, and you should take time to develop\nyours, but here are some tips that I recommend you apply to your presentations\nto make them as fun and interesting as possible:\n\nTell a story\n\n    \n\nBad presentations feel like a rattled-off collection of random thoughts and\ngood presentations take you on a journey and tell a story. Before you write\nyour presentation, think about how you can weave your points together into a\nlogical story. Remember, all stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end;\nthink about how this can apply to the things you want to talk about.\n\nBuild tension\n\n    \n\nThe greatest stories in the world have tension in them; you build up the\ntension in your audience and then relieve it. You should do the same in your\npresentations. In many of my presentations I tell a story about how I got\nsomewhere, and often the tension is created when I share how I made some bad\ndecisions and how I got back on the right path. Think about where your tension\noccurs and make sure you build up to it.\n\nPlan first, design second\n\n    \n\nMany people start creating a presentation by getting right into slide design.\nDon’t do this; you will obsess over the design before you know the structure\nof your presentation, and this is a huge time sink. Instead, grab a pen and a\npad (or a text editor on your computer) and start noting the key points your\nwant to cover and how they map to slides. When you have a few words describing\neach slide and they’re in the order you would present the slides, you can use\nthis as a guide for creating your slide deck.\n\nKeep slide content to a minimum\n\n    \n\nWhen you give a presentation your audience should focus primarily on what you\nare saying, not what you are showing in the deck. Slides full of content,\ndetail, bullet points, and other fluff will merely distract your audience from\nwhat you are saying. As such, keep the content on the slides to a minimum.\n\nKnow your comedic limitations\n\n    \n\nThis is a tough pill to swallow for some, but know your comic limitations. A\nnot-particularly funny person trying to be funny is nothing short of\nembarrassing. I am not saying jokes are off-limits, but do what feels natural\nto your personality.\n\nPractice, practice, practice\n\n    \n\nNo matter how many presentations you have given, practice is always the key to\na well-executed and delivered presentation. Always run through your\npresentation a few times, time it to make sure it is the right length, and get\nit down pat. A great tip here is to video yourself delivering your\npresentation; you can then observe your body language and delivery better.\n\nPrepare the presentation essentials\n\n    \n\nBefore you deliver the presentation, always ensure that you have available a\nglass of water and a sheet of paper with a list of your slides. One of these\ndays you will have a dry mouth and a brain fart; make sure you are prepared\nfor both.\n\n### Creating attractive slides\n\nBy far the most important aspect of delivering a great presentation is in the\nway the speaker structures and communicates the content. We have all sat\nthrough dry, boring, monotonous talks, and many of you will have seen fun,\ninteresting, and vibrant talks.\n\nWhat is also important in delivering a great presentation is creating slides\nthat support what you are saying effectively. Unfortunately, over the years\nmany presenters have treated their slides almost like an entirely different\nentity to the content they are talking about. Remember, though, that the\npurpose of the slides is to visualize and simplify the understanding of the\ncontent you are discussing. In other words, what you say and the slides you\nshow should knit together like those mittens your grandma used to give you\nwhen you were six years old and had a bowl haircut.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, your presentation should tell a story, and your\nslides should be used like the pictures in a storybook to outline and\nillustrate your story as it progresses. Unfortunately, some presenters only\never illustrate their presentations with diagrams, overlapping circles, bar\ncharts, and other output from the yawn factory.\n\nEveryone has her own slide design style, but I want to recommend an approach\nthat I strongly suggest you all use. Here it is…get ready for it and fasten\nyour seatbelts:\n\n> _Your slides can only contain either (1) a picture, or (2) no more than 10\n> words._\n\nThe world has seen enough slides filled with bullet points, overly complex\ndiagrams, arrows, overlapping circles, hundreds of logos, and other\npresentation horrors.\n\nAs you can see with one of my slides, shown in [Figure\n7-2](ch07.html#good_slide_design \"Figure 7-2. This simple slide design\nconsists of only a few words and a simple graphic.\"), I prefer to use only a\nfew words or just an image; it makes the slide less distracting and more\nvisually interesting.\n\nKeep your slides simple and use them as a means to offer a visual cue to\nindicate where you are in the story. It will distract your audience less (they\ncan’t read all those bullets and listen to what you are saying at the same\ntime), it will look attractive, and it will just result in a more interesting\nexperience.\n\n![This simple slide design consists of only a few words and a simple\ngraphic.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159257.png.jpg)\n\nFigure 7-2. This simple slide design consists of only a few words and a simple\ngraphic.\n\n### Long versus short presentations\n\nIn July 2011, I gave one of the opening keynotes at OSCON, a large open source\nconference in Portland, Oregon. The talk was 15 minutes long, and it was OK.\nWhile I didn’t consider it a bad talk, it wasn’t what I considered my best\nwork.\n\nImmediately after the presentation I gave my second talk, which was 40 minutes\nlong, and I was very happy with the results. A filled room of folks seemed to\nfind the talk useful and there were plenty of questions. I did consider that\nto be some of my better work.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, my 15-minute keynote felt OK and my 40-minute talk felt\nsolid.\n\nSomething was bothering me for much of the day about why this was. My\ndissatisfaction was not with the execution of the keynote; I felt I was\nreasonably vibrant and articulate in the way I presented it. But I was less\nhappy with the content and the structure. It felt to me that not enough of the\nrubber hit the road.\n\nI had been giving talks at conferences around the world for over 12 years. I\nhad taken pride in striving to deliver useful content, but wrapping it up in a\nloose and entertaining style, and providing plenty of anecdotes to identify\nwith the audience. Twelve years in, I felt pretty confident that I had this\npresentation business down pat. I felt like I had cut my teeth, paid my dues,\nand made all the mistakes I needed to make to perfect the art of delivering a\nsolid presentation.\n\nWell, I was (and probably still am) an idiot.\n\nWhen I started preparing the content for my keynote, I really battled with the\ncontent and the structure. This was a different type of keynote; it was more\nalong the lines of a lightning talk in terms of duration, but it had the\ngravitas of a keynote. It needed to be thought-provoking and set the stage for\ndiscussions elsewhere at OSCON. But I needed to do this in a short burst of\ntime, and make it feel like an experience that people could identify with. I\nhad my message; I believed we were at the beginning of a renaissance in\ncommunity management, but I found the shorter nature of the presentation and\nits position as a keynote more challenging than I expected it to be.\n\nAfter delivering the keynote and thinking about why it didn’t feel as right as\nit should have, I came to some conclusions, which I want to share. If you are\na presenter some of these thoughts might be useful in terms of how you think\nabout your presentations, too.\n\nFirst, my presentation style has always been story-oriented; I build up a\ncontext, provide some tension in that context, and then deliver an outcome\nthat strives to relieve the tension and provide insight. As such, there is a\ncertain amount of setup and context building that gets the audience up the\ncurve; then I deliver the outcome and bring the audience back down over the\ncurve and provide conclusions. This storytelling component takes time…valuable\ntime in a short presentation.\n\nSecond, Steph Walli (a friend of mine and proofreader of the first edition of\nthis book) observed that while there is a very real skill in writing novels,\nthere is also a real but very different skill in writing short stories. This\nobservation was insightful to me. Short stories by definition need the\nstorytelling to be more compact, and the finesse and skill is in delivering\nthe same smooth setup and transition of events, but with fewer keyframes\nthrown into the mix.\n\nAs such, I came to the conclusion that I like to tell stories in my\npresentations, but my career thus far had been from the perspective of a\nnovelist as opposed to a short-story writer. This was illustrated when my\nlonger talk felt more natural and _more me_ , yet the keynote felt personally\nmore awkward and _less me_. While I was confident in my skills in delivering a\n30- or 40-minute presentation, I discovered that delivering a shorter\npresentation that needs to have the same or a greater level of gravitas\nrequired a very different and distinctive set of skills, which I then wanted\nto acquire.\n\n# Summary\n\nBuzz is a complex and wide-ranging topic and one that can be exercised in many\ndifferent ways. Fundamentally, the art of building buzz varies from person to\nperson. Some will keep the game simple and use email and blogs to build\nexcitement, and others will organize more grandiose campaigns and events; some\nwill even cut crop circles in the ground in the shape of a logo to get the\nword out. The extravagance of the buzz campaign is often directly linked to\nthe extravagance of the personality behind it, but this is not a closed-door\nclub in which only those born with a sense of adventure can build great buzz.\nAnyone can develop this sense for thinking outside the box.\n\nAt the heart of these approaches is thinking of ways in which you can point\neyeballs in your direction and then deliver a message. It is important to get\nthe balance right here: buzz without substance is _hype_ , and you should\navoid that like the plague. Always ensure that the message you send is just as\ncompelling as the buzz approach you used.\n\nOne last note about thinking outside the box: it is a risky business. You are\ngoing to make mistakes and end up frustrating some folks. When you do screw\nup, see it as a learning process. Pick yourself up and objectively review what\nyou did. All mistakes are acceptable under the premise that you learn from\nthem. As you continue to build more and more buzz, you will make fewer\nmistakes and create more successes as you bring people to your community.\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n[3] No, he is not my uncle.\n\n[4] For an example of inflated speaking requirements, see Richard Stallman’s\nat <https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/pipermail/developers-\npublic/2011-October/007647.html>.\n\n\n# Chapter 8. Measuring Community\n\n“Learning without thought is labor lost.”\n\n—Confucius\n\nGreat community leadership requires accepting the volatility of community.\nVolunteer communities are a bubbling pot of varying personalities,\ncommitments, skills, and experiences. This is why I often refer to the work of\ncommunity leaders as “herding cats.” But as leaders we are here not only to\nlead and inspire our cats, but also to learn to see the patterns in the chaos\nthat is community.\n\nThere are many patterns out there: common personality traits, techniques for\ngetting people excited about something, methods of handling conflict, common\nopinions, and more. It is these patterns, correlations, and structures that\nhelp us to better manage our own communities, as well as share our experiences\nwith others. When I see a pattern, I want to share it so that you can use it\nin your communities. Unfortunately, the randomness of the chaos can sometimes\nhide these patterns from common view, and many perceive “community\nmeasurement” as something of an oxymoron.\n\nEarlier in this book we contrasted logical vessels such as programming\nlanguages with more randomized entities such as community:\n\n> [Programming languages] live and breathe in a world where the answer to a\n> question is _yes_ or _no_ ; there is no _maybe_. In a world where _maybe_\n> does not exist, you can plan ahead for an answer. With community, the\n> importance and diversity of the question is equally essential.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that community is unpredictable and\nimmeasurable, but let’s not overemphasize the challenges of “maybe.” Community\nmay not be as straightforward as “yes” and “no,” but that doesn’t mean we\ncan’t see the patterns, learn them, and share them.\n\nOur strategic plan has helped us lay out a blueprint for what our community\ncan achieve. But a plan is just that: a plan. It is a statement of work that\nwe _intend_ to do. It is not enough to simply provide your community with a\nstrategic plan, even if it was collaboratively produced. Your community is\ngoing to need help, support, and some gentle nudging to achieve these goals.\n\nGreat community leadership requires regular and consistent feedback. When we\noriginally produced our strategy, we were conscious of creating a feedback\nloop to gather input from our community. We now need to enforce the same\nfeedback loop when it comes to executing the items in that plan. To really\nknow we are achieving our goals, we need to be able to _measure_ our community\neffectively.\n\n# Community Self-Reflection\n\nPeople can be broadly divided into three groups that define their approach to\ntasks.\n\nThe first group believes they know best. They go after their goals with little\nor no input from anyone else. They have a clear idea in their minds of what\nneeds to be done, and they do it. They don’t solicit feedback, because they\ndon’t need feedback: they know best. They are confident, if a little cocky at\ntimes.\n\nThe second group wouldn’t know a decision if it hit them in the face. They\nneed extensive help and guidance to determine how to achieve their goals, and\nthey need coaching in the individual steps involved. If they had their way,\nthey would ask you to do it for them. In the absence of delegation they\ninstead want you to advise, make decisions, and generally think for them.\n\nI am a fan of neither cocky nor procrastinating people. I am, however, a\n_huge_ fan of the third category of people: those who are confident in their\napproach, but who reinforce and improve said approach with feedback,\nmentoring, and guidance. Interestingly, many of the members of the first group\nshun this approach as a perceived admission of imperfection. Well, I hate to\nbreak this to you, folks, but none of us are perfect. The American singer and\nactress Eartha Kitt described it perfectly: “I am learning all the time. The\ntombstone will be my diploma.”\n\nThe greatest leaders are always willing to listen and learn, and the most\ninspiring people I have worked with have taken this approach. This is what I\npersonally strive for, and I encourage you to do the same.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, community is very much a soft science. It is an art\nform that is improved and extended by sharing stories and experiences. It is\nthese tales that extend our knowledge and offer us insight. The greatest gift\nyou can offer to a community is the willingness to listen. When leaders\nlisten, their community talks and everyone feels engaged.\n\n# The Foundations of Feedback\n\nThere are lots of easy ways to measure communities—the number of members on a\nforum, the number of contributions to a shared project, and so forth—but it’s\nnot so easy to find _meaningful_ measurements. We want our measurements to\nfeed into our interpretations of what we’re doing and to trigger changes that\ncan further improve our work.\n\nUnfortunately, many community leaders obsess a little too much over the act of\n_gathering information_ as opposed to gathering _meaningful_ information. The\ngoal here is not to construct an enormous vacuum cleaner to suck every tiny\ndetail of your community into a graph. The goal is instead to identify what we\ndon’t know about our community and to use measurements as a means to\nunderstand those things better.\n\nMeasurements without meaning are simply annoying. Randomly sucking in\nstatistics is intensely time-consuming—not only for you, but also for the\npeople who provide you with the input. Most of us reading this book will be\nbuilding volunteer communities in which time is a precious substance. Don’t\nwaste it.\n\nEach time you engage with your contributors to gather feedback, there is an\nunwritten yet implicit social contract: as a result of the feedback they\nexpect change—hopefully positive change. When positive change does not happen,\nfrustration sets in. If your measurements have purpose and you are willing to\nmake a change based on those measurements, your community will be satisfied.\n\n## Defining Purpose\n\nEarlier in this book we constructed our strategic plan, which included a\nvocabulary identifying the key features of our strategy. Let’s have a quick\nrecap:\n\n  * We first created a _mission statement_ that outlined the broad aims of the community.\n\n  * Based on this statement we produced a set of high-level _objectives_. These are the major achievements that together form our mission statement.\n\n  * For each objective we have a set of _goals_. Each goal is a near-term outcome that we want to achieve. When we complete all the goals in an objective, we can consider the objective achieved.\n\n  * For each goal we have a set of _actions_. When we complete all of the actions in a goal, we can consider the goal achieved.\n\nAs you can see, the different parts of the strategy are nested inside one\nanother. They look something like this:\n\n  * Mission Statement\n\n    * Objective\n\n      * Goal\n\n        * Actions\n\n        * Actions\n\n        * Actions\n\n      * Goal\n\n        * Actions\n\n        * Actions\n\n    * Objective\n\n      * Goal\n\n        * Actions\n\n        * Actions\n\nOur goals are the target of our feedback. They are what we want to measure.\nThey are the purpose and the reason for our work throughout this chapter.\n\nInside these goals we are going to build extra features into this hierarchy:\n_hooks_ and _data_. These features will help us gather important feedback on\nhow well we are achieving the goal.\n\nWith a clear set of goals, each containing meaningful measurement facilities,\nwe will be able to take a snapshot of the internals of our community that\nshows us how our strategic plan is proceeding. If the measurements show a lack\nof progress, we may have to alter actions, goals, or even objectives.\n\n# Hooks ’n’ Data\n\nSo far we’ve discussed the importance of gathering feedback and measurements\nfrom our community, and that the focal point is the goals we decided on in our\nstrategic plan. The next step is to build into each goal a feedback loop that\ncan deliver information about our progress on the goal.\n\nThis feedback loop is composed of two components— _hooks_ and _data_ :\n\nHooks\n\n    \n\nA hook is a medium or resource in which we can slurp out useful information\nabout our goal. As an example, if our goal was to reduce crime in a\nneighborhood, a hook could be local crime reports from the police. The reason\nI call them hooks is that they are the protruding access points in which we\ncan display interesting information.\n\nData\n\n    \n\nIf a hook is the medium that provides useful information, data is the\ninformation itself. Using our previous example of a goal to reduce crime in a\nneighborhood, the hook (local crime reports) could provide data such as “10\ncrimes this month.” The data is composed of two attributes, the data itself\nand the measurement unit. Again, the kind of unit can be used to feed a\ndisplay (e.g., numerical units are great for graphs).\n\nTo help understand this further, let’s look at an example. In the Ubuntu\ncommunity, my team has worked to help increase the number of people who become\nnew developers. In our strategic plan we created an objective to increase the\nnumber of community developers and fleshed it out with goals for improving\ndeveloper documentation, awareness, and education. Each goal had the expected\nset of actions. For us to effectively track progress on the objective, we\nneeded data about developer growth.\n\nFortunately, we have access to a system called\n[Launchpad](http://www.launchpad.net), which is where all Ubuntu developers do\ntheir work. This system was an enormous hook that we could use to extract\ndata. To do this we gathered a range of data types:\n\n  * The current number of developers (e.g., 50 developers)\n\n  * How long new contributions from prospective developers took to be mentored by existing developers (e.g., 1.4 weeks)\n\n  * How many of these new contributions are outstanding for mentoring (e.g., 23 contributions)\n\nLaunchpad had all of this information available. Using some computer programs\ncreated by Daniel Holbach, we could extract the data. This allowed us to track\nnot only the current number of developers, but also how quickly progress was\nbeing made: we knew that if the number of developers was regularly growing, we\nwere making progress.\n\nWe could also use this data to assess the primary tool that new developers use\nto participate in Ubuntu: the queue of new contributions to be mentored. When\na new developer wants to contribute, she adds her contribution to this queue.\nOur existing developers then review the item, provide feedback, and if it is\nsuitable, commit it.\n\nBy having data on the average time something sits on that queue as well as the\nnumber of outstanding items, we could (a) set reasonable expectations and (b)\nensure that the facility was working as well as possible.\n\nIn this example, Launchpad was a hook. Using it involved some specific\nknowledge of how to physically grab the data we needed from it. This required\nspecialist knowledge: a script was written in Python that used the Launchpad\nAPI to gather the data, and then it was formatted in HTML to be viewed.\n\nLaunchpad was an obvious hook, but not the only one. Although Launchpad could\nprovide excellent numbers, it could not give us personal perspectives and\nopinions. What were the thoughts, praise, concerns, and other views about our\ndeveloper processes and how well they worked? More specifically, how easy was\nit to get approved as an Ubuntu developer?\n\nTo gather this feedback, our hook was a developer survey designed for\nprospective and new developers. We could direct this survey to another hook:\nthe list of the most recently approved developers and their contact details.\nThis group of people would be an excellent source of feedback, as they had\njust been through the developer approval process and it would be fresh in\ntheir minds.\n\nWith so many hooks available to communities, I obviously cannot cover the\nspecific details of how to use them. This would turn _The Art of Community_\ninto _War and Peace_ —complete with tragic outcome (at least for me).\nFortunately, the specifics are not of interest, as all hooks can be broadly\ndivided into three categories:\n\nStatistics and automated data\n\n    \n\nHooks in this category primarily deal with _numbers_ , and numbers can be\nautomatically manipulated into statistics.\n\nSurveys and structured feedback\n\n    \n\nThese hooks primarily deal with _words and sentences_ and methods of gathering\nthem.\n\nObservational tests\n\n    \n\nThese hooks are _visual observations_ that can provide insight into how people\nuse things.\n\nLet’s take a walk through the neighborhood of each of these hooks and learn a\nlittle more about them.\n\n## Statistics and Automated Data\n\nPeople have a love/hate relationship with statistics. Gregg Easterbrook in\n_The New Republic_ said, “Torture numbers, and they’ll confess to anything.”\nDespite the cynicism that surrounds statistics, they turn up insistently on\ntelevision, in newspapers, on websites, and even in general pub and restaurant\nchitchat. The problem with the general presentation of statistics is that the\nnumbers are often used to make the point itself instead of being an indicator\nof a wider conclusion.\n\nStatistics are merely indicators. They are the metaphorical equivalent of the\nnumbers and gauges on the dashboard of a car. No single reading can advise on\nthe health of the car; the gauges, along with the sound of the car itself, how\nit handles, its look and feel, and the smell of burning oil all combine to\ngive you an indication that your beloved motor may be under the weather.\n\nDespite the butchered reputation of statistics, they _can_ offer us valuable\ninsight into the status quo of our community. Statistics can provide hard\nevidence of how aspects of your community are functioning.\n\nMany hooks can deliver numerical data. Here are a few examples:\n\n  * Forums and mailing lists can deliver the number of posts and number of members.\n\n  * Your website can deliver the number of visitors and number of downloads.\n\n  * Your meeting notes can deliver the number of participants and number of topics discussed.\n\n  * Your development tools can deliver the number of lines of code written, number of commits made to the source repository, and number of developers.\n\n  * Your wiki can deliver the number of users and number of pages.\n\nFor us to get the most out of statistics, we need to understand the mechanics\nof our community and which hooks can deliver data from those mechanics. We\nwill discuss how to find hooks from these mechanics later in this chapter.\n\n### The risks of interpretation\n\nAlthough statistics can provide compelling documentation of the current status\nquo of your community, they require skill to be interpreted properly. A great\nexample of this is forum posts. Many online communities use _discussion\nforums_ , the online message boards in which you can post messages to a common\ntopic (known in forum parlance as a _thread_). Within most forums there is one\nstatistic that everyone seems to have something of a love affair with: the\ntotal number of posts made by each user.\n\nIt’s easy to see how people draw this conclusion. If you have three users, one\nwith 2 posts, one with 200 posts, and one with 2,000 posts, it’s tempting to\nbelieve the user with 2,000 posts has more insight, experience, and wisdom.\nMany forums latch onto this perspective and provide labels based on the number\nof posts. As an example, a forum could have these labels:\n\n0–100 posts: New to the Forum  \n---  \n101–500 posts: On the Road to Greatness  \n501–1,500 posts: Regular Hero  \n1,501–3,000 posts: Dependable Legend  \n3,001+ posts: Expert Ninja  \n  \nAs an example, if I had 493 posts, this would give me the “On the Road to\nGreatness” label, but if I had 2,101 posts, I would have the “Dependable\nLegend” label. These labels and the number of posts statistic are great for\npumping up the members, but they offer little insight in terms of quality.\n\nQuantity is rarely an indicator of quality; if it were, spammers would be the\ndefinition of email quality. When you are gathering statistics, you will be\nregularly faced with a quantity versus quality issue, but always bear in mind\nthat quality is determined by the specifics of an individual contribution as\nopposed to the amalgamated set of contributions. What quantity really teaches\nus is experience. No one can deny that someone with 1,000 forum posts has keen\nexperience in the forum, but it doesn’t necessarily reflect the quality of his\nopinion and insight.\n\n### Plugging your stats into graphs\n\nStats with no presentation are merely a list of numbers. When articulated\neffectively, though, statistics can exhibit the meaning that we strive for.\nThis is where graphs come into play.\n\nGraphs are an excellent method of displaying lots of numerical information and\navoiding boring the pants off either (a) yourself or (b) other people. Let’s\nlook at an example. Earlier we talked about a project to increase the number\nof community developers in Ubuntu, and one piece of data we gathered was the\ncurrent number of community developers who had been approved. This is, of\ncourse, a useful piece of information, and as the number climbs it helps\nindicate that we are achieving our goal. What that single number does not\nteach us, though, is how _quickly_ we are achieving our goal.\n\nImagine that we had 50 developers right now and we wanted to increase that\nfigure by 20% a year. This would mean we would need to find five developers in\nthe next six months. This works out to approximately one developer per month.\nIf we want to encourage this consistency of growth, we need not only to look\nat the number of current developers once, but also to track it over time so\nthat we can see if we are on track to achieve our 20% target. Using this\nexample in the Ubuntu world, we could use Launchpad to take a regular snapshot\nof the number of current developers, plot it on a graph, and draw a line\nbetween the dots. This could give us a growth curve of new developers joining\nthe project.\n\nAnother handy benefit of graphs is to show the impact of specific campaigns on\nyour community. On my team at Canonical we have a graph that shows the current\nnumber of bugs in Ubuntu. On the graph is a line that shows the current number\nof bugs for each week. As you can imagine, the line that connects these\nnumbers shows a general curve of our bug performance. This line is generally\nfairly consistent.\n\nEach cycle, we have a special event called the [Ubuntu Global\nJam](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam) in which our community comes\ntogether to work on bugs. Our local user groups organize bug-squashing\nparties, and there are online events and other activities that are all based\naround fixing bugs. Interestingly, each time we do the event, we see a drop in\nthe number of bugs on our graph for the days that the Global Jam happens. This\nis an excellent method of assessing the impact of the event on our bug\nnumbers.\n\nTechnical Tip\n\nYou may be wondering how you can gather data from various hooks and display\nthem in a graph automatically. I just wanted to share a few tips. If this\nseems like rocket science to you, I recommend that you seek advice from\nsomeone who is familiar with these technologies.\n\nGathering data from hooks is hugely dependent on the hook. Fortunately, many\nonline services offer an application programming interface (API) that a\nprogram can use to gather the data. This will require knowledge of\nprogramming. Many programming languages, such as Python and Perl, make it\nsimple to get data through the API.\n\nAnother approach with hooks is to screen-scrape. This is the act of\ndownloading a web page and figuring out what text on the page has the data.\nThis is useful if an API is not available.\n\nFor graphing, many tools are available that can ease graphing if the data is\navailable. One such tool is [Cricket](http://cricket.sourceforge.net/), and of\ncourse, you could load data into a spreadsheet with a comma-separated value\n(CSV) file if required.\n\n## Surveys and Structured Feedback\n\nSurveys are an excellent method of taking the pulse of your community. For us,\nthey are simple to set up, and for our audience, they are simple to use. I\nhave used surveys extensively in my career, and each time they have provided\nme and my teams with excellent feedback. Over the next few pages I want to\nshare some of the experience I have picked up in delivering effective surveys.\n\nThe first step is to determine the purpose of the survey. What do you want to\nachieve with it? What do you need to know? Every survey needs to have a\npurpose, and it is this purpose that will help you craft a useful set of\nquestions that should generate an even more useful set of data.\n\n### Note\n\nYou should avoid surveys just for the purpose of creating a survey. Only ever\ncreate a survey if there is a question in your head that is unanswered.\nSurveys are tools to help you understand your community better: use them only\nwhen there is a purpose. Examples of this could include understanding the\nperception of a specific process, identifying common patterns in behavior in\ncommunication channels, and learning which resources are used more than\nothers.\n\nAgain, your goals from your strategic plan are a key source of purpose for\nyour surveys. As an example, if your goal is “increase the number of\ncontributors in the community,” you should break down the workflow of how\npeople join your community, and produce a set of questions that test each step\nin this workflow. You can use the feedback from the answers to gauge whether\nyour workflow is effective and use the data as a basis for improvements.\n\n### Choosing questions\n\nWhen deciding on questions, you should be conscious of one simple fact:\neveryone hates filling out surveys. When someone has considered participating\nin your survey, you need to be able to gather that person’s feedback as\nquickly and easily as possible. This should take no longer than five minutes.\nAs such, I recommend that you use no more than 10 questions. This will give\nthe respondent an average of 30 seconds to answer each question.\n\nThe vast majority of surveys have questions with multiple-choice ratings for\nsatisfaction. Most of you will be familiar with these: you are provided with a\nsatisfaction scale between 1 (awful) and 5 (excellent), and are then expected\nto select the appropriate satisfaction grade for that question. Surveys like\nthis are simple and effective.\n\nThe Variance of the Vote\n\nRatings are a funny beast, and everyone interprets them differently.\n\nA great example of this is the employee performance review that so many of us\nare familiar with. In one organization I worked at, the scale ranged from 1\n(unacceptable) to 5 (outstanding). I did a small straw poll of how different\npeople interpreted the grading system, and the views varied tremendously:\n\n  * Some felt that if 1 is unacceptable and 5 is outstanding, 3 would be considered acceptable, and if staff members completed their work as contractually expected, a 3 would be a reasonable score.\n\n  * Others felt that meeting contractually agreed-upon standards would merit a 5 on the scale, and that 3 would indicate significant, if tolerable, lapses.\n\n  * Interestingly, some people informed me that they would never provide a 5, as they felt there was _always_ room for improvement.\n\nWhen people fill in your survey, you will get an equally varied set of\nexpectations around the ratings. You should factor this variation of responses\ninto your assessment of the results. One way to do this is to add up the\nresponses from each person and increase or reduce them proportionally so that\neach person’s total adds up to the same points. But this may not be valid if\nsomeone legitimately had a wonderful or horrific experience across the board.\n\nWhen writing your questions, you need to ensure that they are simple, short,\nand specific enough that your audience will not have any uncertainty about\nwhat you are asking. When people are confronted with unclear questions in\nsurveys, they tend to simply give up or pick a random answer. Obviously both\nof these are less-than-stellar outcomes. Let’s look at an example of a bad\nquestion:\n\nDo you like our community?  \n---  \n  \nWow, how incredibly unspecific. Which aspect of the community are we asking\nabout? What exactly does “like” mean? Here is an example of a much better\nquestion:\n\nDid you receive enough help and assistance from the mailing list to help you\njoin the community successfully?  \n---  \n  \nThis is more detailed, easier to understand, and therefore easier to answer.\nIt’s no coincidence that the results are more immediately applicable to making\nuseful changes in the community.\n\nUsing the previous example of a survey to track progress on the goal of\nincreasing the number of contributors, here are some additional example\nquestions:\n\nHow clear was the New Contributor Process to you?  \n---  \nHow suitable do you feel the requirements are to join the community?  \nHow useful was the available documentation for joining the community?  \nHow efficiently do you feel your application was tended to?  \n  \nEach of these asks a specific question about your community and the different\nprocesses involved.\n\n### Showing off your survey reports\n\nEarlier, when we talked about statistics, we also explored the benefits of\nusing graphs for plotting numerical feedback. We could feed the data directly\ninto the graph, and the findings are automatically generated. This makes the\nentire process of gathering statistics easy: we can automate the collection of\nthe data from the hook (such as regularly sucking out the data) and then the\npresentation of the data (regularly generating the graph).\n\nUnfortunately, this is impossible when dealing with feedback provided in\nwords, sentences, and paragraphs. A person has to read and assess the findings\nand then present them in a report. It is this report that we can present to\nour community as a source for improving how we work.\n\nReaders have priorities when picking up your report. They don’t want to read\nthrough reams and reams of text to find a conclusion: they want to read the\nconclusion up front and optionally read the details later. I recommend that\nyou structure your survey findings reports as follows:\n\n  1. Present a broad conclusion, a paragraph that outlines the primary revelation that we can take away from the entire survey. For example, this could be “Developer growth is slower than expected and needs to improve.” It is this broad conclusion that will inspire people to read the survey. Do keep one important thing in mind, though: don’t turn the conclusion into an inaccurate, feisty headline just for the purpose of encouraging people to read the survey. That will just annoy your readers and could lead to inaccurate buzz that spirals out of your control, both within and outside your community.\n\n  2. Document the primary findings as a series of bullet points. These findings don’t necessarily need to be the findings for each question, but instead the primary lessons to be learned from the entire survey. It is these findings that your community will take as the meat of the survey. They should be clear, accurate, and concise.\n\n  3. Present a list of recommended actions that will improve on each finding. Each action should have a clear correlation with the findings that your survey presented. The reader should be able to clearly identify how an action will improve the current situation. One caveat, though: not all reports can present action items. Sometimes a factual finding does not automatically suggest an action item; it may take negotiation and discussion for leaders to figure out the right action.\n\n  4. Finally, in the interest of completeness, present the entire set of data that you received in the survey. This is often useful as an addendum or appendix to the preceding information. This is a particularly useful place to present nonmultiple-choice answers (written responses).\n\nWhen you have completed your survey and documented these results, you should\nensure that they are available to the rest of your community. Sharing these\nresults with the community is (a) a valuable engagement in transparency, (b) a\nway to share the current status quo of the community with everyone, and (c) an\nopportunity to encourage others to fix the problems or seek the opportunities\nthat the survey uncovers.\n\nTo do this, you should put the report on your website. Ensure that you clearly\nnote the date on which the results were taken. This will make it apparent to\nyour readers that the results were a snapshot of that point in the history of\nyour community. If you don’t provide a date, your community will assume the\nresults are from today.\n\nWhen you put the results online, you should notify your community through\nwhatever communication channels are in place, such as mailing lists, online\nchat channels, forums, websites, and more.\n\nDocumented Results Are Forever\n\nBefore we move on, I just want to ensure that we are on the same page (pun\nintended) about documenting your results.\n\nWhen you put the results of your survey online, you should never go back and\nchange them. Even if you work hard to improve the community, the results\nshould be seen as a snapshot of your community.\n\nYou should ensure that you include with the results the date that they were\ntaken so that this is clear.\n\n## Observational Tests\n\nWhen trying to measure the effectiveness of a process, an observational test\ncan be one of the most valuable approaches. This is where you simply sit down\nand watch someone interact with something and take notes on what the person\ndoes. Often this can uncover nuances that can be improved or refined.\n\nThis is something that my team at Canonical has engaged in a number of times.\nAs part of our work in refining how the community can connect bugs in Ubuntu\nto bugs that live upstream, I wanted to get a firm idea of the mechanics of\nhow a user links one bug to another. I was specifically keen to learn if there\nwere any quirks in the process that we could ease. If we could flatten out the\nprocess a little, we could make it easier for the community to participate.\n\nTo do this, we sat down and watched a contributor working with bugs. We noted\nhow he interacted with the bug tracker, what content he added, where he made\nmistakes, and other elements. This data gave us a solid idea of areas of\nredundancy in how he interacted with a community facility.\n\nWhat Jorge on my team did here was user-based testing, more commonly known as\n_usability testing_. This is a user-centered design method that helps\ndevelopers evaluate software by having real people use it and provide\nfeedback. By simply sitting a few people in front of your software and having\nthem try it out, you can obtain valuable feedback for a design before too much\nis invested in coding a bad solution.\n\nUsability testing is important for two reasons. The most obvious is that it\ngets us feedback from a lot of real users, all doing the same thing. Even\nthough we aren’t necessarily looking for statistical significance, recognizing\nusage patterns can help the designer or developer begin to think about how to\nsolve the problem in a more usable way.\n\nThe second reason is that usability testing, when done early in the\ndevelopment cycle, can save a lot of community resources. Catching usability\nproblems in the design phase can save development time normally lost to\nrewriting a bad component. Catching usability problems early in a release\ncycle can preempt bug submissions and save time triaging. This is on top of\nthe added benefit that many users may never experience such usability issues\nbecause they are caught and fixed so early.\n\nOpen source is a naturally user-centered community. We rely on user feedback\nto help test software and influence future development directions. A weakness\nof traditional usability testing is that it takes a lot of time to plan and\nconduct a formal laboratory test. With the highly iterative and aggressive\nrelease cycles some open source projects follow, it is sometimes difficult to\nprovide a timely report on usability testing results. Some examples of\nprojects that overcame problems in timing and cost appear in the accompanying\nsidebar ([](ch08.html#examples_of_low-budget_comma_rigorous_us \"Examples of\nLow-Budget, Rigorous Usability Tests\")) by Celeste Lyn Paul, a senior\ninteraction architect at User-Centered Design, Inc. She helps make software\neasier to use by understanding users’ work processes and designing interactive\nsystems to fit their needs. She is also involved in open source software and\nleads the KDE Usability Project, mentors the OpenUsability Season of Usability\nprogram, and serves on the Kubuntu Council.\n\nExamples of Low-Budget, Rigorous Usability Tests\n\nThere are some ways you can make usability testing work in the open source\ncommunity. Throughout my career in open source, I have run a number of\nusability tests, and not all have been the conventional laboratory-based\ntesting you often think of when you hear “usability test.” These three\nexamples help describe the different ways usability testing can be conducted\nand how it can fit into the open source community.\n\nMy first example is the usability testing of the Kubuntu version of Ubiquity,\nthe Ubuntu installer. This usability test was organized as a graduate class\nactivity at the University of Baltimore. I worked with the students to design\na research plan, recruit participants, run the test, and analyze the results.\nFinally, all of the project reports were collated into a single report, which\nwas presented to the Ubuntu community. The timing of the test was aligned with\na recent release and development summit, and so even though the logistics of\nthe usability test spanned several weeks, the results provided to the Ubuntu\ncommunity were timely and relevant.\n\nAlthough this is the more rare case of how to organize open source usability\ntesting, involving university students in open source usability testing\nprovides three key benefits. The open source project benefits from a more\nformal usability test, which is otherwise difficult to obtain; the university\nstudents get experience testing a real product, which looks good on a\ncurriculum vitae; and the university students get exposure to open source,\nwhich could potentially lead to interest in further contribution in the\nfuture.\n\nMy second example involves guerilla-style usability testing over IRC. I was\nworking with Konstantinos Smanis on the design and development of KGRUBEditor.\nUnlike most software, which usually is in the maintenance phase, we had the\nopportunity to design the application from scratch. While we were designing\ncertain interactive components, we were unsure which of the two design options\nwas the most intuitive. Konstantinos coded and packaged dummy prototypes of\nthe two interactive methods while I recruited and interviewed several people\non IRC, guiding them through the test scenario and recording their actions and\nfeedback. The results we gathered from the impromptu testing helped us make a\ndecision about which design to use.\n\nThe IRC testing provided a quick and dirty way of testing interface design\nideas in an interactive prototype. However, this method was limited in the\ntype of testing we could do and the amount of feedback we could collect.\nRemote usability testing provides the benefit of anytime, anywhere, anyone at\nthe cost of high-bandwidth communication with the participant and control over\nthe testing environment.\n\nMy final example is the case of usability testing with the DC Ubuntu Local\nCommunity (LoCo). I developed a short usability testing plan that had\nparticipants complete a small task that would take approximately 15 minutes to\ncomplete. LoCo members brought a friend or family member to the LoCo’s Ubuntu\nlab at a local library. Before the testing sessions, I worked with the LoCo\nmembers and gave them some tips on how to take their guest through the test\nscenario. Then, each LoCo member led their guest through the scenario while I\ntook notes about what the participant said and did. Afterward, the LoCo\nmembers discussed what they saw in testing, and with assistance, came up with\na few key problems they found in the software.\n\nThe LoCo-based usability test was a great way to involve nontechnical members\nof the Ubuntu community and provide them an avenue to directly contribute. The\ndrawback to this method is that it takes a lot of planning and coordination: I\nhad to develop a testing plan that was short but provided enough task to get\nuseful data, find a place to test (we were lucky enough to already have an\nUbuntu lab), and get enough LoCo members involved to make testing worthwhile.\n\n—Celeste Lyn PaulSenior Interaction ArchitectUser-Centered Design, Inc.\n\nAlthough Celeste was largely testing end-user software, her approach was very\ncommunity-focused. The heart of her approach involved community collaboration,\nnot only to highlight problems in the interface but also to identify better\nways to approach the same task.\n\nThese same tests should be made against your own community facilities.\nConsider some of the following topics for these kinds of observational tests:\n\n  * Ask a member to find something on your website.\n\n  * Ask a prospective contributor to join the community and find the resources he needs.\n\n  * Ask a member to find a piece of information, such as a bug, a message on a mailing list, or another resource.\n\n  * Ask a member to escalate an issue to a governance council.\n\nEach of these tasks will be interpreted and executed in different ways. By\nsitting down and watching your community performing these tasks, you will\ninvariably find areas for improvement.\n\n## Measuring Mechanics\n\nThe lifeblood of communities, and particularly collaborative ones, is\ncommunication. It is the flow of conversation that builds healthy communities,\nbut these conversations can and do stretch well beyond mere words and\nsentences. All communities have collaborative mechanics that define how people\ndo things together. An example of this in software development communities is\nbugs. Bugs are the defects, problems, and other it-really-shouldn’t-work-that-\nway annoyances that tend to infiltrate the software development process.\n\nEvery _mechanic_ (method of collaborating) in your community is like a\nconveyor belt. There is a set of steps and elements that comprise the\nconversation. When we understand these steps in the conversation, we can often\nidentify hooks that we can use to get data. With this data we can then make\nimprovements to optimize the flow of conversation.\n\nLet’s look at our example of bugs to illustrate this.\n\nEvery bug has a lifeline, and that lifeline is broadly divided into three\nareas: _reporting_ , _triaging_ , and _fixing_. Each area has a series of\nsteps involved. Let’s look at reporting as an example. These are the steps:\n\n  1. The user experiences a problem with a piece of software.\n\n  2. The user visits a bug tracker in her web browser to report that problem.\n\n  3. The user enters several pieces of information: a summary, description, name of the software product, and other criteria.\n\n  4. When the bug is filed, the user can subscribe to the bug report and be notified of the changes to the bug.\n\nNow let’s look at each step again, see which hooks are available, and identify\nwhat data we could pull out:\n\n  1. There are no hooks in this step.\n\n  2. When the user visits the bug tracker in her web browser, the bug tracker could provide data about the number of visitors, what browsers they are using, which operating systems they are on, and other web statistics.\n\n  3. We could query the bug tracker for anything that is present in a bug report: how many bugs are in the tracker, how many bugs are in each product, how many bugs are new, and so on.\n\n  4. We could gather statistics about the number of subscribers for each and which bugs have the most subscribers.\n\nSo there’s a huge range of possible hooks in just the bug reporting part of\nthe bug conveyor belt. Let’s now follow the example through with the remaining\ntwo areas and their steps and hooks.\n\nThe following are the triaging steps:\n\n  1. A triager looks at a bug and changes the bug status.\n\n  2. The triager may need to ask for additional information about the bug.\n\n  3. Other triagers add their comments and additional information to help identify the cause of the bug.\n\nHere are the triaging hooks:\n\n  1. We could use the bug tracker to tell us how many bugs fall into each type of status. This could give us an excellent idea of not only how many bugs need fixing, but also, when we plot these figures on a graph, how quickly bugs are being fixed.\n\n  2. Here we can see how often triagers need to ask for further details. We could also perform a search of what kind of information is typically missing from bug reports so that we can improve our bug reporting documentation.\n\n  3. The bug tracker can tell us many things here: how many typical responses are needed to fix a bug, which people are involved in the bug, and which organizations they are from (often shown in the email address; e.g., [billg@microsoft.com](mailto:billg@microsoft.com)).\n\nThe following are the fixing steps:\n\n  1. A community member chooses a bug report in the system and fixes it. This involves changing and testing the code and generating a patch.\n\n  2. If the contributor has direct access to the source repository, he commits the patch. Otherwise, the patch is attached to the bug report.\n\n  3. The status of the bug is set to FIXED.\n\nAnd here are the fixing hooks:\n\n  1. There are no hooks in this step.\n\n  2. A useful data point is to count the number of patches either committed or attached to bug reports. Having the delta between these two figures is also useful: if you have many more attached patches, there may be a problem with how easily contributors can get commit access to the source repository.\n\n  3. When the status is changed, we can again assess the number of changes and plot them on a timeline to identify the rate of bug fixes that are occurring.\n\nIn your community, you should break down the conveyor belt of each mechanic\nthat forms your community. These could be bugs, patches, document\ncollaboration, or otherwise. When you break down the process and identify the\nsteps in the process and the hooks, this helps you take a peek inside your\ncommunity.\n\n## Gathering General Perceptions\n\nPsychologically speaking, perception is the process in which awareness is\ngenerated as a result of sensory information. When you walk into a room and\nyour nose tells you something, your ears tell you something, and your eyes\ntell still more, your brain puts the evidence together to produce a\nperception.\n\nPerception occurs in community, too, but instead of physical senses providing\nthe evidence, the day-to-day happenings of the community provide the input.\nWhen this evidence is gathered together, it can have a dramatic impact on how\nengaged and enabled people feel in that community.\n\nEven in the closed and frightening world of a prison community, with its\nconstant threat of random violence and tyranny, there are shared perceptions,\ninterestingly between staff members and prisoners. Professor Alison Liebling,\na world expert on prisons, discovered common cause between staff members and\nprisoners in her “Measuring the Quality of Prison Life” study, which took\nplace between 2000 and 2001. Liebling invited staff members and prisoners to\nreflect on their best rather than worst experiences and identified broad\nagreement between both groups on “what matters” in prison life. She discovered\nthat “staff and prisoners produced the same set of dimensions, suggesting a\nmoral consensus or shared vision of social order and how it might be\nachieved.” Her work provided a model that described and monitored that which\npreviously appeared impossible to measure: “respect, humanity, support,\nrelationships, trust, and fairness,” which had remained hidden under the\ntraditional radar of government accountability.\n\nPerception plays a role in many communities, particularly those online. Some\nyears back I was playing with a piece of software (that shall remain\nnameless). I spent quite some time setting it up and was more than aware of\nsome of the quirks that were involved in its installation. In the interest of\nbeing a good citizen, I thought it could be useful take notes on some of the\nquirks, what I expected, and how the software did and did not meet my\nexpectations. I thought this would provide some useful real-world feedback\nabout a genuine user installing and using the software.\n\nI carefully gathered my notes, and when I was done I sent them via email to\nthe software community’s mailing list. I strived to be as constructive and\nproactive in my comments as possible: my aim here was not to annoy or insult,\nbut to share and suggest.\n\nAnd thus the onslaught began....\n\nEmail after email of short-tempered, antagonistic, and impatient responses\ncame flowing in my general direction. It seemed that I struck a nerve. I was\ncriticized for providing feedback on the most recent stable release and not\nthe unreleased development code in the repository(!), many of my proposed\nsolutions were shot down because they would “make the software too easy” (like\nthat is a bad thing!), and the tone was generally defensive.\n\nStrangely, I was not perturbed, and I still took an interest in the software\nand the community, but as I dug deeper I found more issues. The developer\nsource repository was very restrictive; the comments in bug reports were\nequally defensive and antagonistic; the website provided limited (and overtly\nterse) information; and the documentation had statements such as, “If you\ndon’t understand this, maybe you should go somewhere else.” Well, I did.\n\nWhen all the pieces of evidence combined in my brain, I developed a somewhat\nnegative perception of the community. I felt it was rude, restrictive,\ncliquey, and unable to handle reasonably communicated constructive criticism.\n\nIt was perception that drove me to this conclusion, and it was perception that\ncaused me to focus on another community in which my contributions would be\nmore welcome and my life there would be generally happier.\n\nThroughout the experience there was no explicit statement that the community\nwas “rude, restrictive, cliquey, and unable to handle reasonably communicated\nconstructive criticism.” This was never written, spoken of, or otherwise\nshared.\n\nMeasuring perception involves two focus points. On the one hand you want to\nunderstand the perception of the people inside your community, but on the\nother hand you also want to explore the perception of your community from the\noutside. This is particularly important for attracting new contributors.\n\nTo measure both kinds of perception, our hooks are people, and we need to have\na series of conversations with different people inside and outside our\nprojects to really understand how they feel. As an example, imagine you are a\nsmall software project and you have a development team, a documentation team,\nand a user community. You should spend some time having a social chitchat with\na few members in each team. This will help paint a picture for you.\n\nSome of the most valuable feedback about perception can happen with so-called\n“corridor conversations.” These are informal, social, ad hoc conversations\nthat often occur in bars, restaurants, and the corridors of conferences. These\nconversations typically have no agenda, there are no meeting notes, and they\nare not recorded. The informal nature of the conversation helps the community\nmember to relax and share her thoughts with you.\n\n### Perception of you\n\nAnother important measurement criterion is the perception of you as a person.\nAs a leader you are there to work with and represent your community. Your\ncommunity will have a perception of you that will be shared with its members.\nYou want to understand that perception and ensure that it fairly reflects your\nefforts.\n\nPerception of community leaders is complex, particularly when a leader works\nfor a company to lead the community. As an example, as part of my current role\nat Canonical as the Ubuntu community manager I work extensively with our\ncommunity in public, running public projects. There are, however, some\ninternal activities that I focus on. I help the wider company work with the\ncommunity. I work on Canonical projects that are currently under a Non-\nDisclosure Agreement (NDA). There is also the work I do with my own team, such\nas building strategy, reviewing objectives, conducting performance reviews,\nmaking weekly calls, and more. Many of these internal activities are never\nseen by the wider community, and as such the community may not be privy to the\ngenuine work that helps the community but is not publicized.\n\nGathering feedback about your performance is hard work. It is difficult to\ngather constructive, honest, and frank feedback, because most people find it\nimpossible to deliver that content to someone directly. Even if you are\nentirely open to feedback, you need to ensure that the people who are speaking\nto you feel there will be no repercussions if they offer criticism. You need\nto work hard to foster an atmosphere of “I welcome your thoughts on how I can\nimprove.”\n\nDue to the difficulty of gathering frank feedback, you may want to rely on\nemail to gather it. When we have physical conversations or even discussions on\nthe phone, body language, vocal tone, and enunciation make those conversations\nfeel much more personal. The visceral connection may make it intimidating for\nyour respondent to provide frank and honest feedback (particularly if that\ninvolves criticism). Email removes these attributes in the conversation, and\nthis can make gathering this feedback easier.\n\nTransparency in Personal Feedback\n\nIn the continuing interest of building transparency, an excellent method is to\nbe entirely public in letting your community share their feedback about you.\n\nAs an example, you could write a blog entry asking for feedback and\nencouraging people to leave comments on the entry, and allow anonymous\ncomments.\n\nThis is a tremendously open gesture toward your community. It could also be\nviewed as a tremendously risky gesture. There is a reasonable likelihood that\nsomeone could share some negative thoughts about you there, and others may\nagree. (But that’s also feedback you need to collect!)\n\n# Anonymity and Privacy\n\nThe act of measuring community is an exercise in gathering information about\nother people and drawing conclusions. Some of this data will be generic to the\ncommunity as a whole (such as statistics about mailing lists or forums) and\nsome will be specific to an individual (such as a response to a survey). When\ndata can be directly linked to an individual, the subject of anonymity and\nprivacy steps into view. Although at first these two topics may seem like they\ncould potentially cause problems if you put your foot down wrong, their\nguidelines are simple. Let’s talk about them both now.\n\n## Anonymity\n\nAnonymity is a valuable tool when gathering feedback, especially around\ncontentious topics. If you are gathering feedback about a particular\ngovernance body in your community, many people may feel uncomfortable\nassociating their views with their identity. For this reason, anonymous\nfeedback can be a useful option.\n\nThere is a dark side to anonymity, though. The Internet has long proved that\nwhen identity can be hidden or obscured, all manner of whack jobs and nutcases\nwant to be your friends or, rather, your enemies. In the world of the\nInternet, the quote from the 1988 movie _The Dead Pool_ really resonates:\n“Opinions are like assholes. Everybody’s got one and everyone thinks everyone\nelse’s stinks.” If you open an avenue for people to share their views online,\nexpect anything and everything.\n\nAnonymity creates two major risks. First, when identity is hidden, some jump\nat the opportunity to be rude, arrogant, and sometimes outright offensive.\nThese people are often referred to as _trolls_ in online communities. The\nsecond, subtler problem is that anonymity will sometimes cause people to\noverstate their concern with an issue: they will often dial up the annoyance\nfactor to 11\\. This means you get a misrepresented perspective, and this can\nskew your aim of getting genuinely representative views from the community.\n\nWith this we have a difficult balance: there is value in anonymous feedback,\nbut there is a significant risk of trolling and overstated unrepresentative\nperspectives. How do we find a balance? A simple solution is to welcome\nanonymous data, but be cognizant of what it could represent. Therefore, when\nconducting your research, you should encourage a combination of feedback with\nidentity attached in addition to anonymous feedback.\n\nConsider the example of running a survey to assess the quality of experience\nof a contributor joining your community. I recommend that you have two\nidentical surveys: one directed to the 10 most recent people who have joined\nyour community, and the other open to anyone. When evaluating the results,\ntreat the survey that you directed to particular people as the most valuable\ninput, but still consider highly the results of your other survey. Combining\nthe results of both surveys is likely to produce a balanced perspective.\n\nBefore we move on, I want to dispel the myth of anonymity on the Internet.\nThis all boils down to a simple rule:\n\nNo one is anonymous on the Internet.  \n---  \nNo one.  \n(Yes, that includes you super-elite hacker types, too.)  \n  \nIn the online world it’s tempting to believe you are anonymous, but so-called\n“anonymity” is merely a carefully constructed set of abstractions that\nultimately puts most people off trying to discover your identity. These\nbarriers always have a trail, though, and if someone tried hard enough, he\ncould break down the barriers of anonymity.\n\nThe value and risk of anonymity is hugely dependent on what kind of community\nyou are building. If you are building a small local knitting community to\nmeet, share patterns, and enjoy one another’s company, it is unlikely that\nanyone is going to work too hard to break anonymity. If you are involved in a\ntechnical community based around security and hacking, some will see your\nanonymity as a challenge. In more technical communities, as well as\ncommunities dealing with sensitive issues in politics or health, you may have\na harder time soliciting anonymous feedback for fear of others finding out.\n\n## Privacy\n\nThe middle ground between anonymity and full public disclosure is feedback\nprovided with an identity under the proviso that it is kept private.\nMaintaining this level of privacy is an important consideration when handling\nanyone’s information, and particularly important when handling sensitive\ninformation around conflict.\n\nPrivacy is sacred. It should never be compromised, and when you engage with\nsomeone who shares private information, you become responsible for that\ninformation. As such, you should ensure that you have a suitable means of\nsecuring that privacy. This does not need to include super-technical encrypted\nemails and retina scans to get into your laptop, but simple processes that\nwill ensure that your respondents have confidence in you keeping their\ninformation to yourself.\n\nThe most fundamental underlying principle here is that people trust you. It\ndoesn’t matter what procedures you put in place to stop leaks; if people don’t\ntrust you as a warm body, they will not entrust their thoughts to you. As we\ndiscussed earlier, you should always build a sense of trust and confidence in\nyour community. You should then build on this trust with methods of gathering\nfeedback that are secure.\n\nAs an example, I was once performing an assessment of a governance body and\nwanted to gather feedback from each member of the group. I was keen for this\nfeedback to be brutally blunt and honest, and to do this I made a few\nconscious decisions:\n\n  * To ensure privacy, I did not use a public resource such as a wiki or forum to ask for the feedback, but instead requested that it be sent to my private email address. This meant that all submissions came directly to me.\n\n  * I was explicit in the email that the information provided should be frank and honest and that the answers would be subject to absolute privacy. I made it clear that the feedback would not be shared either publicly, with the other members, or with other third parties.\n\n  * I sent the email to private email addresses, not an email address associated with the commercial sponsor. This would remove any conspiracy-theory worries of someone snooping on email on a mail server (which would be inconceivable in a practical sense, but I just wanted to assuage any possible worries).\n\n  * I emailed the questions to each member individually, as opposed to using either CC or BCC to send them. This ensured that there would be no accidental Reply-All gaffe in which one member’s feedback would go out to the other members.\n\nAll of these steps were subtle but important: they helped to secure confidence\namong the respondents so that they could provide me with the honest feedback\nthat I required. It worked, and I got some excellent feedback in that\nassessment.\n\nThe last bullet on the previous list was all about reducing the possibility of\na gaffe. These accidents and mistakes have happened to us all: accidental\nemails, phone calls, and messages sent to the wrong people with sometimes\nembarrassing consequences. These gaffes are bad enough in nonsensitive\nsituations, but when we are dealing with private data, they can be very\nserious. As such, you need to ensure that you are aware of possible gaffes and\ntry at all costs to avoid them.\n\nAs a starting point, here is a list of what not to do:\n\nEmail\n\n    \n\nIn an email discussion about private topics, always check who is receiving the\nemail. This is particularly risky these days with auto-completion. Believe me,\nI speak from experience....\n\nMailing lists\n\n    \n\nAlways double-check that when having a private conversation, someone hasn’t\nincluded a mailing list address. This happens a lot more often than you would\nimagine.\n\nBlogging\n\n    \n\nWhen you hear that exciting piece of news that someone tells you, ask if you\ncan blog it. Many have fallen foul of blogging private information. That never\nends well.\n\nPhone calls\n\n    \n\nWhen discussing private topics, check who is around you. Members of your\ncommunity whom you don’t know may be listening to every word.\n\nOnline chat networks\n\n    \n\nBefore you talk to “jon_c” online about some private topics, double-check that\nyou’re not actually talking to “jon_o” or “ron_c”. That could get you in quite\na pickle.\n\nBy carefully considering the expectations and risks surrounding privacy, it is\nlikely that you can gather your feedback with no ill consequences. The key\nthing here is to _think before you act_. Checking that list of email addresses\nonce more may take 10 seconds, but it could prevent years of potential\nembarrassment.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> We balance visibility and privacy in the same way we’ve always done, with\n> social norms.

It is time to learn how to manage and track our\nwork.\n\n\n# Chapter 9. Managing and Tracking Work\n\n“Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.”\n\n—Frank Zappa\n\nWhen I joined Canonical back in 2006, the profession of community management\ndidn’t really exist. Coming from a journalism and consultancy background, I\nnever set out to be a community manager. No one did. Like many, I ended up\nfalling into community management basically by talking myself into it and\ngetting lucky.\n\nOn the morning of my first day on the job, I made a cup of PG Tips tea, sat\ndown at my laptop, and logged on. Two weeks later, when I was done jumping up\nand down while high on the fumes of landing the new gig, said new deal had\nbecome very real very quickly. Surrounded by my heroes and directly working\nfor the founder of Ubuntu, I started to feel the crushing sense of\nresponsibility for what I had taken on.\n\nErk.\n\nI had asked for this job because, in my mind, Ubuntu was (and still is)\ncritical to the success of bringing Free Software, openness, and choice to\ntechnology. I saw it as a vehicle for change, and the only way to keep that\nvehicle moving forward was to grow, excite, and motivate a community. My\npassion for being the guy who helps make that happen got me through the\ninterviews and kept my nerves under control, but now my nerves were dining out\non paranoia. If I was going to be on the hook for driving this vehicle, which\ndirection was I going to take it in?\n\n# Credibility and the Need to Track Progress\n\nAside from working with my heroes, reporting to one of the most well-known\npeople in open source, and not knowing exactly where to start, I faced one\nother glorious wrinkle in the cheek of my new job: _limited credibility_.\n\n_Credibility_ is the respect you earn from different stakeholders, be they\ncommunity members, management, founders, press, or others. Gaining credibility\nis critical if you want to be successful. Consequently, a lack of credibility\ncan be rather damning.\n\nUnfortunately, today gaining credibility is a challenge for community\nmanagers. The profession of community management is still very young, and as\nit continues to evolve, we are surrounded by those who don’t understand what\nwe do, express cynicism about what we can achieve, or choose to assume we’re\ndoing something entirely different from the reality, and likely far less\nflattering. I am sure some of you have heard the ol’ chestnut of “Oh, you\nfolks just write blog entries all day and spew out headlines to nerds on\nTwitter, right?”\n\nWhen I started in my new job, I did have _some_ credibility, but it was in a\nmore general, transient sense. I had been writing for years about open source\nand technology and talking about it on LugRadio, and one of the small perks of\nsuch ramblings was that some people remembered my name from my articles,\nblogs, and podcasts. While this boosted my ego as an opinionated and hungry\nyoung journalist, none of that mattered a dime when I started as the Ubuntu\ncommunity manager. I had limited credibility in the Ubuntu community outside\nof the faint flickers of a reputation in the wider yet tiny open source\nfishbowl.\n\nIt wasn’t that I had negativity stapled to my reputation; but credibility is\n_context-sensitive_ and my name just didn’t resonate with the wider Ubuntu\ncommunity. Ubuntu is a _meritocracy_ and it thrives on rewarding those who add\nsignificant and sustained contributions with the respect they deserve. Now\nlook at what happened: here was this English guy, with few direct\ncontributions to Ubuntu and a new job title of “Ubuntu community manager,” who\nwas tasked with growing and optimizing the community. I am pretty surprised\nthat this didn’t result in pitchforks and fires; it just goes to show how\npleasant and understanding the Ubuntu community is.\n\nCredibility makes great things possible. Your community is inspired by you and\nseeks your leadership, your management entrusts some of the organization’s\nmost delicate resources to you, and you are considered an invaluable resource\nto all stakeholders.\n\nFortunately, gaining credibility is devilishly simple, albeit with hard work\nas a prerequisite. You need to _prove yourself_. It is as simple as that.\n\nThis world is full of talkers: people who chalk their game up on a board, try\nto sell their abilities, and espouse their accomplishments. Moreover, the\nyoung profession of community management has already attracted a subset of\n_all-talk-and-no-trousers_ kinds of people. If you want to get a taste of\nthis, just type “social media” into Google. The social media space has\nunfortunately been infested with poseurs and wannabes who try to climb to the\ntop of their ladder, churning out the same old nonsense, often with little\nsubstance. While talking a big game may get you far, real accomplishments and\nthe demonstration of such abilities will get you much farther.\n\nTherefore, this chapter is all about tracking the progress of our work. Doing\nso serves two quite different purposes.\n\nFirst, we’ll talk from a communal perspective about how to transform the\nstrategic focus we developed earlier in the book into a project plan, which in\nturn gives us the basis for tracking our work and resources in order to\ndeliver great results. By structuring our work effectively and executing it in\na predictable manner, we can better communicate outward the success of that\nwork and the value it brings.\n\nSecond, from a slightly more selfish perspective, all of this project\nmanagement, tracking, and transparency is going to help us to develop the\ncredibility we need to be successful. This is a _no poseur zone_ , my friends.\n\nAs such, this chapter is a valuable and important part of our journey.\nUnfortunately, I have seen many community leaders and managers go about their\nbusiness without structuring or tracking their work, and who consequently\nstruggle to demonstrate the value they bring. It is these folks who often get\npigeonholed as \"Oh, you folks just write blog entries all day and spew out\nheadlines to nerds on Twitter, right?” Unlike the poseurs who try to convince\npeople of their credibility, this chapter will help you to _demonstrate_ it\nvia real, practical results.\n\n# The Importance of Tracking Our Work\n\nIn the middle of 2009 an ambitious new open source project started. In the\ninterests of protecting the innocent, we will kindly refer to this project as\n_Plectrum_. The project had big ideas and was not just planning to create a\nFree Software implementation of something that had previously existed, but\ninstead wanted to entirely rethink the approach, assumptions, and workflow\nencased in the problem. Consequently, the founders’ ideas were multilayered;\nthey needed to prepare the foundations first and then build up from there.\n\nIn announcing their plans for Plectrum, the founders created incredible\nmindshare with their audience; the planned goals really captured the\nimagination of onlookers. Those of you who are not distracted and noodling\naround on Facebook will remember that we talked about _mindshare_ back in\n[Chapter 7](ch07.html \"Chapter 7. Building Buzz\"). We said this in the context\nof Linux desktop marketshare:\n\n> Some vector within the great mythic noosphere, the “sphere of human\n> thought,” probably knows exactly how many Linux desktops there are in the\n> world, but actual usage doesn’t mean a bean in the scheme of things. What\n> really matters is _mindshare_.\n>\n> Mindshare is perception. It is a global gut feeling. Mindshare and\n> perception is the magic that wins hearts and minds. It is also the\n> explosive, seductive substance that clears the path for change, and it is\n> mindshare that enables communities to have a voice.\n\nWhile mindshare is what really matters, it has to have _substance_. Mindshare\nwith little substance is nothing more than hype. Thus, in building buzz and\nexcitement you need to ensure that the mindshare is broadly commensurate with\nthe practical value you are able to build within a reasonable time frame.\n\nWith such a significant journey ahead of them and much of it down in the weeds\nin the low-level parts of their plan, the Plectrum founders discovered that\nattracting contributors was more difficult than they expected, but they\nplodded on. As the months rolled by, the project continued to chalk up its big\nideas, release video interviews, and continue work on the lower layers. Months\nturned into years, and while the founders of the project were still working\nsolidly on these lower-level pieces, they hit troubled waters when they\ndecided to ask for donations to fund the continuation of the project.\n\nThe issue here was not in asking for money (although money is often\ncontentious in Free Software communities), but that this appeal for donations\nsuddenly brought the credibility of the project and its founders crashing into\nview. A blogger then posted a somewhat cynical post outlining concerns about\nthe ability of the project to deliver on its promises, and a swathe of\ncommentators lined the corridor of conversation, many in raging agreement\nabout such concerns. The vocal cynics had a shared opinion: Plectrum had made\nmore promises than real, practical releases of its wider vision.\n\nNaturally, the Plectrum founders were crestfallen. They had poured months of\ntheir lives into their project, had written Free Software for the good of the\nwider community, and had battled significant technical challenges in\ndelivering their revolutionary solution. I know the founders. They are good\npeople with sincere intentions, but unfortunately they had made one fatal\nmistake: while they had inspired a vision, they had failed to effectively\nshowcase the steps they had taken in delivering that vision. People can run on\na platform of promises for only so long before faith erodes and cynicism and\nsuspicion set in.\n\nThis is precisely what we want to avoid. Whether you are running a community,\na project, a department in your company, or anything else, you want to build a\nculture of _delivery_. The greatest contributors in any community or company\nstart with a vision, break it down into pieces, and deliver the results. While\nmany such contributors make great plans and even execute them well, too many\npeople fail to track and articulate this progress to others; this is exactly\nwhat this chapter will discuss. Successfully hot-rodding your work to track\nsuch progress and then clearly articulating your results will give you a\nreputation for bringing great value and will build your credibility.\n\nThis work is important not only to build credibility, but also to reduce risk\nfor your community and its ability to make decisions and deliver value.\n\n## Tracking the Right Things\n\nI was once in Chicago doing some consultancy work with an organization that\nwanted to grow a community within its membership. This was a familiar gig for\nme: the company was flying me out to its annual conference where I would talk\nabout the opportunity of community and how we could harness it in the\norganization. I would deliver the presentation, and then talk more about the\nspecifics of what kind of community the company needed and how to grow it.\n\nThe evening before I was due to deliver my presentation there was a cocktail\nreception. Everyone else seemed to know everyone, whereas I only knew one guy:\nthe guy who had arranged for me to be flown out. He was very much the\npractical and inspirational leader of the organization, so at the reception he\nwas inundated with people who wanted to schmooze with him. I didn’t want to\nget in his way, so I mingled around the room and got to know some of the other\nfolks in the organization.\n\nSoon I got to chatting with a gentleman who was on the board of the\norganization. In his early 60s, he was soft-spoken, confident, yet humble; he\nwas one of those people who you could tell had studied at the University of\nHard Knocks. He had been there, done that, paid his dues, and survived to tell\nthe tale.\n\nIt turned out that he was quite interested in community building and was\nfamiliar with some of my work. We had a long and interesting conversation\nabout growing and building teams who want to work together. We talked for\naround an hour that night and took a variety of topics for a spin, but one\nthing he said particularly stuck in my mind:\n\n> You know what, Jono, if you are not keeping score, and counting the right\n> things, it doesn’t count.\n\nIt seemed like such obvious advice, but it resonated with me. For years I had\nbeen working to find interesting and effective methods of building community,\nand had measured and tracked this work in some of the more obvious ways, but\nhis statement got me thinking more about how we decide _which_ particular\nscores count.\n\nFor the next few days, I thought about what I keep score of, how I gather\nthose scores, how those scores influence my future decision making, and to\nwhat extent I prioritize keeping score in the scheme of my general work\nresponsibilities.\n\nWhat’s important is that the act of keeping score allows you to _do better\nwork_ ; it helps you to identify opportunities and improve problematic areas.\nMy friend’s primary lesson was to avoid being lured down rabbit holes in which\nyou track things that have no tangible benefits or outcomes. In other words,\nalways ensure that you track your progress, but make sure the things you track\nwill shed more light on areas in which you can drive improvements forward. We\nare not interested in just collecting numbers here; we are interested in\ncollecting indicators of success and failure to help us map out the best\npossible path forward in our work.\n\nSince that conversation, I developed some general focus points for shaping how\nwe identify these areas to track:\n\nUnderstand outcomes, not numbers\n\n    \n\nAs we just discussed, always look for the outcome that you want to achieve as\nopposed to only the numbers; the numbers are just evidence to help you\nunderstand something better (e.g., the number of Twitter followers is just a\nnumber, no matter how big it is, but what does this number tell us about our\nsuccess within the scheme of other community metrics?). When thinking about\nwhat you want to track, think about what you want to understand as opposed to\npurely which numbers you want to see.\n\nKnow what not to track\n\n    \n\nSome community managers fall into the trap of tracking things that don’t bring\na better understanding or that simply bring raw data that means nothing by\nitself. As an example, tracking the number of posts on a forum does not tell\nus anything about the quality of the content or participation, it merely\nindicates traffic. If you want to determine quality you would instead want to\nlook at the content that was posted. Knowing which data is uninteresting, even\nif other stakeholders consider it important (e.g., managers often consider\nunintelligent numbers such as the number of forum posts as indicative of\ngrowth and therefore success), is a useful skill to develop.\n\nAvoid data porn\n\n    \n\nThere are countless analytics, statistical tracking, visualization, and other\ntools available. Many companies are making money on the fact that people like\n_data porn_ ; that is, an overload of information that makes you feel secure\nthat you have all the available information at hand. Again, try to identify\nthe outcomes on which you seek better visibility, but don’t get overloaded in\nthe figures. We want to know how well the car performs, and we don’t need to\nsee every number on every dial to accomplish that.\n\nKnow how to read your scores\n\n    \n\nWhen you’re tracking progress, success or failure is determined by combining\nmultiple data points together. Just having the data available is one thing,\nbut being able to (a) read it effectively, (b) combine it with other data to\nget better outcomes, and (c) communicate these outcomes to others are valuable\nskills. These skills will develop over time; remember, understanding data and\ngetting outcomes out of it will not happen overnight.\n\nThese golden rules are a general best-practice blanket that you should wrap\naround your work. We will get into the specifics of how you track your\nprojects, growth and decline, and community health later in this chapter.\n\n## Within the Context of a Company\n\nTracking progress and the effectiveness of your work is critically important\nif you work professionally as a community manager. As I mentioned earlier,\ncommunity management is still very much a misunderstood art and science, and\nwe need not only to build credibility but also to demonstrate the ways we\nbring value to both the community and the company that employs us.\n\nAt the 2011 gathering of the Community Leadership Summit event I organize each\nyear, I scheduled a session to discuss how we effectively communicate our\naccomplishments and progress to different stakeholders in our companies.\nInterestingly, the types of measurements reported by attendees were massively\ndiverse. Some attendees were expected to show pure growth figures (e.g., the\nnumber of Twitter followers, forum posts, etc.), some were expected to\ntranspose community into a dollar figure (e.g., how many leads from the\ncommunity result in sales), and some had no accountability for their work at\nall.\n\nIt is clear that no consistent requirements or formats for demonstrating\nprogress span across all companies. Every company has different needs,\nexpectations, and approaches to how it assesses and justifies its various\ninvestments. One thing is fairly certain, though: while you may not need to\nprovide any kind of progress reporting right now, as your company grows, you\nalmost certainly will need to. As such, even if this is not a challenge for\nyou today, I recommend that you start thinking about the solution; it is only\na matter of time before you will need to provide this visibility.\n\n### Defining value\n\nWhen demonstrating to your company that its investment in its community and in\nyou as a community manager (and your team, if appropriate) is worthwhile, it\nis easy to get sidetracked by what I referred to earlier as _unintelligent\nnumbers_. If we all sit down for a few minutes and think about things we can\ncount, we can concoct all kinds of figures: Twitter/Facebook/Google+\nconnections, mailing list posts, forum users, forums posts, website hits,\nsearch engine results, YouTube comments, and more. Numbers don’t really tell\nus anything, though. The challenge here is not in identifying what numbers can\nrepresent our work best, but in how we bring _value_ to the company and to the\ncommunity.\n\n_Value_.\n\nWrite it down on a sticky note. Stick it to your monitor. Stick it to your\ncat. Stick it to your shower head. Wherever you focus your attention, stick\nthat word there: _Value_.\n\nEvery company that invests in something seeks to derive value from its\ninvestment. If a company invests in programmers, it expects to get valuable\ncode from them. If it invests in designers, it expects to get valuable designs\nout of them. Likewise, when investing in you as a community manager, a company\nexpects to get a valuable community relationship out of you. Unfortunately, as\ndescribed earlier, because community management is such a new and unknown art\nand science, it is often unclear to companies how they define the actual value\nthat they get.\n\nThis is why many corporate managers (who are already confused about how the\nhell to manage a community manager) look for these unintelligent numbers as a\njustification for the investment. Although those figures may translate well\ninitially, they won’t bring _real_ value to the company. We instead need to\nidentify where the company wishes to grow value so that we can see how we can\napply our efforts to derive value in our work that also meets these wider\ncompany needs. In other words, if your work aligns with the company’s general\ngoals, it will be easier to justify the value you and your team bring to the\ncompany.\n\nWhen I started at Canonical and reported directly to the founder, Mark\nShuttleworth, I had pretty much free reign in terms of where I directed my\nefforts. Mark trusted my judgment and I worked to bring value to those areas.\nWhile this happy-go-lucky, free-form approach worked well back then, the\ncompany has since grown significantly, there are many more stakeholders now,\nand our strategic focus is far wider. As the company and my career progressed,\nI raised the importance of identifying the company focus and goals so that I\ncould ensure that my team would bring value to these needs as well as the\nneeds of the community.\n\nAs an example, at Canonical we started a project to strategically see growth\nin the number of people creating applications for the Ubuntu platform, as well\nas growing a wider awareness of the company. I can break this into two broad\nareas:\n\nPlatform maturity\n\n    \n\nWe needed to make the platform easier to use, create more documentation, do a\nbetter job of disseminating news, encourage developers to write more\napplications, grow the awareness of those applications, and communicate\nrequired improvements back to the engineers.\n\nBrand recognition\n\n    \n\nWe needed to get more people talking about the brand, improve our presence at\nconferences and developer events, garner more online discussions of the\ncompany, and create a better awareness of who works at the company via\ninterviews and other features.\n\nAll of these tasks are things we can work on with the community. Together we\ncan improve how the platform functions, improve the documentation, raise\ncompany and brand awareness, and more. Likewise, as a community we can better\nraise the visibility of the company while performing this work.\n\nBy identifying where the company as a whole (which typically means where the\nsenior execs see the company going) wishes to build value, your team can\narchitect a set of projects that bring value to those areas. As a result, the\nexecs will automatically get a sense that you are singing from the same hymn\nsheet as everyone else.\n\n### Communicating up and down\n\nWhen you start working as a community manager for a company, you feel like you\njust hit the jackpot. Big time. Did they really just hire me and they really\nare willing to pay me to spend time working with an awesome community? Wow.\n\nSo you start your exciting new job and identify a set of projects that you\nfeel will bring value to the community and the company. As we discussed\nearlier in the book, you put together your mission statement, create your\nstrategic plan, and identify your success criteria. With all this in place and\na rocking community to get out there and work with, you start making the magic\nhappen.\n\nBefore we continue through this chapter and get into the specifics, I want to\nensure that you don’t make a mistake that a lot of new community managers at\ncompanies make. While we have clearly articulated the importance of tracking\nand demonstrating progress in your work, it is important to remember that you\nneed to report both down (to your team and the community) as well as up (to\nyour manager and, if applicable, his manager). The mistake is in thinking that\nthe same level of detail is required both up and down the chain.\n\nYour community and your team love detail. They love it because detail\ndemonstrates the openness and transparency of your community and the\nopportunity for the community to see what work is going on. Your manager and\nhis manager don’t need that level of detail; they have so many other, bigger\nfish to fry that excessive detail will feel like a tremendous inconvenience.\nYou could provide this detail, but they probably won’t read it. So you need to\nprovide an effective summary of accomplishments to build confidence and\ncredibility without blinding them with science.\n\nAs you read this chapter, always think about how you can track and report\nprogress at these two levels of detail; additional detail for the community\nand your team, and summarized detail for management and other key\nstakeholders. We will discuss one useful approach for doing this later in the\nchapter.\n\nBe Careful With Specifics\n\nFor those of you who are quite new to working professionally as a community\nmanager, I want to share a quick tip before we move on.\n\nCommunity is a living, breathing organism. Things change in a fluid manner;\npeople join, people leave, and people who start out as incredibly committed\ncontributors get busy and move on. In all this flux you should be wary of\ncommitting too hard to specific metrics or figures.\n\nI made this mistake once, early in my career. Our developer community was\ndoing well and growing quickly. In the heat of the moment, while talking with\nthe founder of the company, I committed to deliver 300 new developers within a\nyear. This, my friends, was a bonkers thing to commit to. It seemed possible\nwhen I said it, but it was nothing more than a reflection of my naiveté at the\ntime. We saw growth, but of course, not the level of growth that could achieve\nsuch an ambitious goal.\n\nIn some cases such numbers may be required of you, but in my experience,\ntrying to play a numbers game does not make your work more effective; it just\nbrings stress and pressure in delivering numbers as opposed to delivering\nvalue.\n\nNow, this can be a challenge. You may well get a senior exec up in your face\nabout delivering a specific number. In these cases I recommend that you push\nback on the number but strive to identify another way to give the exec\nconfidence in what you can deliver. This is one of the trickiest components of\n_managing up_ and setting accurate expectations, but it is a skill that will\nserve you well.\n\n# What We Need to Manage\n\nNow that we have established the importance of managing and tracking the\ndifferent components of our community, let’s get down to the details of what\nwe should be tracking and some techniques we can use to do this well.\n\nIn every community there are three broad areas in which you should have a\nsolid workflow in place for tracking the work performed. They are:\n\nProjects\n\n    \n\nA project is a unit of work that results in a particular outcome. Each project\nhas a collection of steps that must be executed to achieve that outcome, and\nthese steps are typically distributed across lots of different people, many of\nwhom may be volunteers. Examples of projects include creating a website for a\ncommunity team, building team reporting into your community, creating a new\nproduct feature, and forming a governance council.\n\nGrowth and decline\n\n    \n\nCommunities are composed of many different moving parts. Examples include\nteams, processes for contributing work, governance boards, and more. For each\nmoving part we want to track the growth and decline of content and people to\nensure that they are working effectively.\n\nGeneral health\n\n    \n\nOutside of our projects and the mechanics of how our community operates, we\nalso want to get a feel for the general health of the community, where we are\nseeing positive work, and where there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nFor the rest of this chapter, we will explore these three areas. Each requires\na slightly different approach and operates under different constraints. I am\ngoing to present some approaches and examples that you can apply to your own\ncommunities to get better visibility on your work and that of the community.\n\n# Tracking Projects\n\nProjects are a key piece of furniture in every community. Without a clearly\ndefined set of projects to keep your community members occupied and feeling\nlike there is a sense of focus and direction, your community will feel limp\nand ineffective. _No one_ likes limp and ineffective.\n\nTake a moment and cast your mind way back to the dim, distant depths of\n[Baking in Openness](ch02.html#baking_in_openness \"Baking in Openness\") (you\ncan cheat if you want and flip back to that section), and you might remember\nthat we created a strategic plan for our community. This strategic plan was\nessentially a clearly defined set of goals. Goals are basically projects that\nwe want to coordinate and run to meet the needs of the community.\n\nAs a quick recap, we used this format to structure these projects:\n\n  * OBJECTIVE:\n\n  * GOAL:\n\n  * SUCCESS CRITERIA:\n\n    * Item\n\n    * Item\n\n  * IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n\n    * Item\n\n    * Item\n\n  * OWNER:\n\n  * GOAL:\n\n  * SUCCESS CRITERIA:\n\n    * Item\n\n    * Item\n\n  * IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n\n    * Item\n\n    * Item\n\n  * OWNER:\n\nTo illustrate what one of these OBJECTIVE blocks looks like, here is the same\nexample used back in [Structuring the plan](ch02.html#structuring_the_plan\n\"Structuring the plan\") for creating a website:\n\n  * OBJECTIVE: Build a website for the project.\n\n  * GOAL: Build a structural design for the website content.\n\n  * SUCCESS CRITERIA:\n\n    * All areas of the website structure documented in a specification.\n\n    * Community feedback gathered on the proposal.\n\n  * IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n\n    * Identify the needs of the website by liaising with the community.\n\n    * Document the structure of the website on the wiki.\n\n    * Email the core community team with feedback and merge feedback in.\n\n    * Organize an online meeting to propose any changes to the specification.\n\n    * Build a prototype.\n\n  * OWNER: Jono Bacon.\n\nThe trick in managing projects is to understand how different people are\ninterested in different levels of visibility in your projects. When we can\nconceptualize these layers it helps us to better construct and manage our\nprojects so that different people can see the projects with different lenses\nthat expose different levels of detail.\n\nThese three layers are:\n\nThe _Project_ level\n\n    \n\nThe Project level is the highest level of abstraction, where we just need to\nknow whether the project is on track or not. The SUCCESS CRITERIA in our\nstrategic plan help us to ask a definitive question about whether we succeeded\nin delivering the requirements of the project. For projects that are not yet\ncomplete, we also need to be able to take an acid test at any time to\ndetermine whether the project is generally on track.\n\nThe _Work Unit_ level\n\n    \n\nIn our strategic plan, the OBJECTIVE defines the high-level project and each\nGOAL specifies individual pieces of work that need to be completed to deliver\nthe wider project goal. Each GOAL component may be owned and assigned to\ndifferent people, and we need a means to identify whether work is succeeding\nat this slightly lower level.\n\nThe _Work Item_ level\n\n    \n\nEach work unit is divided into a collection of work items that document\nindividual tasks, each assigned to one person and taking no longer than half a\nday to complete. This is the highest level of detail required, and most people\nwould only see this level of detail for projects they are actively involved in\n(and for which they have work items assigned to them). In a perfect world we\nwould see all work items from all units and be able to see progress on each\n(we will talk about how to do this later in the chapter).\n\nFor each layer we want to provide visibility on progress made toward achieving\neventual outcomes. Each layer maps reasonably well to the visibility required\nfor different people interested in our projects.\n\nAs an example, your manager is likely to be interested only in the Project\nlevel; she is going to be so busy with her own work that she doesn’t want to\nbe swamped with the details. Other active stakeholders and participants (and\nmore curious managers) may want to delve into the Work Unit level. Finally,\nthe people who are actually involved in each work unit will want to get down\nand dirty with the details of the work items.\n\nNow that you have a clear idea of the different levels of abstraction and the\npeople who are likely to be interested in them, don’t make the mistake of only\nproviding these levels of detail to those respective roles (e.g., less detail\nfor managers, more detail for community members). As an example, as a manager\nfor my team I want lots of detail on some projects, and less on others, and in\nmany cases I can’t preempt when I require more detail (it could be related to\na temporary situation or discussion).\n\nWe want to create visibility on our projects that is available to all\nstakeholders and is updated regularly, preferably in an automated way. This\nmeans anyone who wants can see the work, thus resolving the issue of the\nweekly email updates and, importantly, giving transparency to our work.\n\n### Note\n\nOf course, some of you may feel uncomfortable about working so out in the open\nand with so much visibility into your work. For projects that don’t involve\nsensitive or confidential information, I recommend that you work as openly as\npossible. It will be a little unusual at first, but it gets easier and will\nraise your credibility in a very practical and visible way. For sensitive\nprojects, keep as much out in the open as possible, but obviously respect\nconfidences where appropriate.\n\nWhen I started working at Canonical as the Ubuntu community manager, my work\nwas far more unstructured in terms of visibility on projects. I would choose\nareas in which I felt the community needed focus, decide on a set of projects\nthat needed to happen to see improvements, and work on those projects in a\nfairly ad hoc way. Progress would be made and the projects would typically\nsucceed, but they were _hiding in plain sight_ ; while the projects were open\nand transparent, finding details on their progress was difficult for those who\nwere not directly involved.\n\nToday things are quite different. We track projects in Ubuntu at a much more\ngranular level and provide the three levels of visibility outlined earlier\n(Project, Work Unit, and Work Item). While our approach uses tools specific to\nUbuntu, the approach can be customized to other tools; the tools are not what\nis important, the structure is where the value is.\n\n## Structuring Your Projects\n\nThis approach to managing projects hinges on the concept of a _blueprint_. In\n[Chapter 2](ch02.html \"Chapter 2. Planning Your Community\") we created our\nstrategic plan for our different goals. For each goal we should have a\nblueprint.\n\nA blueprint is a document that captures the current state of a project. The\nUbuntu project placed such a high value on these documents that we built a\nspecial blueprints feature into the Launchpad system that we use to build\nUbuntu, but you can store blueprints in whatever way is most convenient for\nyour community. This could be wiki pages, text files, items in a database, or\nsomewhere else. Please note that you will need a means of pulling information\nout of blueprints later, so storing blueprints in plain text somewhere online\nmakes the most sense.\n\nThe aim of these blueprints is to build visibility and transparency into the\nsystem. As such, all data—be it the blueprint, the work items, or the\nvisualization of that data—is completely open and accessible.\n\nA blueprint contains the following information:\n\nTitle\n\n    \n\nA brief description for the work unit, such as “Build social networking\nsupport into the website.”\n\nDescription\n\n    \n\nA few paragraphs outlining the goals for the work unit and any constraints and\nrequirements in place. This should get the reader up to speed on the focus of\nthe work.\n\nStatus\n\n    \n\nThe current status of the work encompassed in the blueprint. Typical status\nvalues are Not Started, In Progress, Slow Progress, Blocked, Completed, and\nPostponed. This field should always be kept up-to-date and should provide a\nsingular overview of the current state of the blueprint.\n\nPriority\n\n    \n\nThe blueprint’s priority within the range of projects you are working on. This\nshould be Essential, High, Medium, or Low. Be sure to distribute the projects\nyou are working on among all four status options; having all projects set to\nHigh doesn’t say anything useful.\n\nOwner\n\n    \n\nThe person who is responsible for delivering the blueprint. This should match\nthe OWNER set for the OBJECTIVE in your strategic plan. This person should be\nexpected to oversee completion of the blueprint. This person may not complete\nthe blueprint himself, but is responsible for guiding those who have work\nitems on that blueprint to deliver them to completion, thus accomplishing the\nblueprint.\n\nMilestone target\n\n    \n\nThe target completion date for the blueprint. It is called a _milestone\ntarget_ because communities often have common milestones that adjust with each\nrelease iteration (e.g., Feature Freeze, Beta).\n\nThese six pieces of information provide high-level visibility of the project;\na manager or third party can easily identify whether the project is on track.\nOf course, the data is only as accurate as the reality it represents, so be\nsure to keep these details up-to-date. I recommend reviewing all your\nblueprints on a weekly basis and checking that everything is current and\naccurate.\n\n### Note\n\nAn even better approach is to automate updates for some of the details. As an\nexample, the Status field could be updated by counting how many work items are\ncompleted, how quickly progress is being made, and so on.\n\nA descriptive blueprint documents your range of projects and work units at a\nhigh level. Now you need to define your work items.\n\n## Managing Work Items\n\nBack when I was a freshly minted manager, the company organized some\nmanagement training sessions to help develop skills among the managers and\nbuild best practices in the company. We were told to be at the office at\nprecisely 8:30 a.m., ready for our instructor, whom I will refer to as Irene\nto protect the innocent. Short and stocky, with a smile like a banana and a\npleasingly bubbly personality, Irene was welcomed to the group. There we sat,\nlooking forward to a brisk day of management training.\n\nAbout 20 minutes in we wanted to kill ourselves. Although only a scrooge would\nknock Irene for her happy-go-lucky approach to the world, she was steadily\nbeginning to get on our nerves. The issue was not her bubbly nature, it was\nwhat she was trying to teach us.\n\nShe would pick topics that seemed obvious and simple, even to a teenager, and\nthen would thoroughly teach each of our grandmothers how to suck eggs, one by\none, in slow, excruciating detail. We dutifully sat there, exchanging looks\nwith one another as if to say, “I can’t believe we have to sit through this.\nIs she going to teach us how to use a spoon next?”\n\nAs the day progressed, Irene continued to waffle on, and our eyelids struggled\nto stay open from the crushing weight of boredom. Eventually the session came\nto a close. We thanked Irene heartily, she seemed happy with her work, and we\nleft to drown our sorrows at our usual watering hole. That night we all sat\nthere as new managers, thinking we knew how all this worked, thinking we knew\nthe answers and feeling somewhat smug that so-called _management trainers_\ntried to teach us what we already knew.\n\nFive years on I realize how wrong we were. While the topics seemed obvious at\nthe outset, painting a picture seems obvious at the outset, too; you just grab\na canvas and a paintbrush, right? What the following years of experience\ntaught us was that while some topics may appear simple, they actually uncover\nsome surprisingly complex lessons that are often difficult to teach, but that\nwe can learn through experience. Irene tried to teach me, and I smiled and\nnodded, but ultimately life itself has taught me to not assume that something\nis simple just because I perceive it to be simple.\n\nWork items. Actions. Tasks. TODOs. Whatever you call them (in this book we\nrefer to them as _work items_), they also seem fairly simple on the outside,\nbut the devil is in the detail. Irene spent much of her time with us covering\nhow to formulate work items, and in retrospect I now understand why she\ncovered them in such detail. Don’t make the same mistake we did. There is a\ncertain art and finesse in deciding, assigning, defining, and documenting work\nitems, which while seemingly simple, actually requires some deeper\nconsiderations and skill. I wish I had learned this earlier in my career, when\nIrene came in to help us.\n\nI can’t assure you that I have learned all there is to know about writing\ngreat work items, but I want to share some tips that can help you get up and\nrunning. If you are tempted to skip this section, don’t; this is really\nimportant.\n\n### Structuring work items\n\nThe whole point of a work item is that it documents a specific task that\nsomeone needs to complete by a certain date. As an example, imagine that my\nwife, Erica, and I are going to cook a meal for some friends who are coming\nover for dinner. Erica is a stunning cook with a great love of food. I am a\nterrible cook with a great love of eating Erica’s food. As such, Erica and I\nboth have clearly defined roles; she is the cook and I try to do all the other\nfairly unintelligent things that only someone with terrible cooking skills can\nbe trusted to do.\n\nThis includes things such as:\n\n  * Go to the store and buy the ingredients.\n\n  * Chop the cilantro and parsley.\n\n  * Juice and zest the lemons.\n\n  * Make the salads.\n\n  * Pour the chef a few glasses of wine.\n\nThese seem like reasonable work items, but looks can be deceiving. While “Chop\nthe cilantro and parsley” seems straightforward, it assumes that I know how\nmuch cilantro and parsley are required for the dish. If the work item read\n“Finely chop 1/2 cup of cilantro and 1 cup of parsley” the expectations would\nbe much clearer.\n\nThe “Go to the store and buy the ingredients” work item is even worse. The\nonly way I could successfully achieve it is if I knew which ingredients are\nrequired for the dish and which store I need to get them from. It would be\nbetter if that specific item were broken into a series of other work items,\nsuch as:\n\n  * Buy 1 lb of imported prosciutto from Lunardi’s.\n\n  * Buy 1 gallon of low-fat milk from Safeway.\n\n  * Buy one bunch of parsley from Safeway.\n\nHere the work items are much more specific; they indicate the ingredients\nrequired, the amount needed, and where they can be purchased. This example\ndemonstrates two key points: work items need to be _small and specific_ , and\nthe _scope_ of the work required should be clear.\n\nThe golden rule for creating work items is that the items should be able to be\naccomplished by anyone with the requisite skills, and this person should\nunderstand what needs to be done by just reading the list of work items. In\nother words, we want to avoid the situation where people need to ask questions\nabout details of a given work item and the specifics of how it should be\nexecuted.\n\nTo achieve this, here are some guidelines that should apply to each of your\nwork items:\n\nBe specific\n\n    \n\nAs we discussed earlier, each work item should be specific and detailed in\nwhat it should accomplish. Each work item should accomplish a clear\ndeliverable outcome. Focus on things such as “Create this” and “Deliver that,”\nand avoid generic items such as “Find out about foo” and “Reach out to bar.”\nAside from generating a lot of questions and unclear steps, unspecific work\nitems are difficult to complete because their outcome is not clearly known. As\nan example, if I have to “Find out about foo,” is the learning part considered\ncompletion of the work item, and if so, how much did I need to learn and to\nwhat degree? Should I share the knowledge or write it down? Being specific\navoids these uncertainties.\n\nBe tight\n\n    \n\nI have a general rule that no work item should require more than half a day’s\nwork, and at most a full day’s work. Items that are too big or feel like too\nmuch of a time sink will almost always be left to the last minute to complete,\nand then will often be forgotten. Smaller, more achievable items require less\nof an up-front mental and time investment and have a higher likelihood of\nsucceeding.\n\nAssign the work\n\n    \n\nEvery work item should have someone who is responsible for owning and\ndelivering it. Work items that are unassigned rarely get completed because\neveryone has plenty of work to do. When working with community volunteers, you\nmay feel it is difficult to ask someone to take on a work item and that it\nwould be better to allow people to just pick and choose what they want to do.\nBut from my experience, community members are often more than happy to\nparticipate when you request specific commitments to specific work items; it\ngives them a sense of participation and team spirit in the community. I think\nmany people would also be surprised how many community members also deliver on\ntheir commitments.\n\nDefine a deadline\n\n    \n\nEvery work item should have a clear deadline for completion. This could be\neither a specific date (e.g., July 1, 2012) or a milestone (e.g., Feature\nFreeze). Regardless, the deadline should be clear and agreed upon with the\nassignee. You also need to keep the deadline up front in the assignee’s mind\nso that she remembers to complete the work. Later in the chapter we will\ndiscuss a technique for accomplishing this with burndown charts.\n\nBe able to pass a success test\n\n    \n\nEvery work item should be able to answer the question, “Was this task\naccomplished?” with a positive response. This is why work items should be\nspecific and clear in what should be delivered, when it should be completed,\nand by whom. If you can read any work item and confidently answer whether it\nwas completed, you are in good shape.\n\nLet’s look at a few examples of some well-defined actions. Here is a simple\nexample:\n\n> Produce a first draft of a Code of Conduct (assigned to Tom Araya, deadline\n> of September 22, 2012)\n\nIn this example the outcome of the action should be a draft document of a Code\nof Conduct. It is clear who the work item is assigned to and when it should be\ncomplete. Of course, the work item does not delve into what should go into the\nCode of Conduct. There are other areas where that discussion can happen; the\nwork item’s purpose is to document the deliverable, when it is due, and who is\nresponsible.\n\nHere is another example:\n\n> Sign a contract for a $1,000 sponsor for Developer Summit Friday party\n> (assigned to Kerry King, deadline of September 22, 2012)\n\nIn this example the outcome is a signed contract for a sponsor who will\nprovide $1,000 for the Developer Summit Friday party. This is also clearly\nassigned with a deadline.\n\nIn both of these examples we can run the _success test_ and identify whether\nthe outcomes were successfully achieved; if we are holding a Code of Conduct\nin one hand and a signed contract in the other, we are feeling pretty awesome\nright now.\n\n### Documenting work items\n\nAlrighty. We defined our project, we talked about how to write great work\nitems, and now we need to write them down. Actually, writing down work items\nserves a few useful purposes, in addition to just helping us to not forget the\nwork items.\n\nFirst, we always want to ensure that the hard work we put into defining our\nwork items is captured in such a way that everyone can get a copy. I always\nrecommend that work items be stored online somewhere, be it a wiki, website,\nformalized work item tracker, or something else. This will ensure that\neveryone who has a work item (and even those who don’t, but are curious to see\nhow well the project is running) can see who is assigned what and when it\nshould be delivered.\n\nStoring work items in a public place also has another subtle benefit. Project\nmanagement theory has taught us that when you provide the list of work items\nin a public place where your peers can see that you have work assigned to you,\nit significantly increases the likelihood of you completing the action for the\nsimple reason that you don’t want to look like a lazy slacker in front of your\npeers. In a world where we strive for transparency in our communities, we can\nuse transparency as an excellent reason to ensure that these work items are\npublic. ;-).\n\n### Note\n\nA useful feature built into the Launchpad system that we use for Ubuntu is\nthat people can _subscribe_ to a blueprint and will be emailed whenever a\nchange occurs to the work items. One of the major benefits of this is that you\ncan then see updates and changes to the details and work items of a given\nproject, and the information comes to you automatically.\n\nThe final consideration when documenting work items is to ensure that each\nitem also communicates how close it is to completion. This is important for\ntwo reasons:\n\n  * We can iterate over each item and see how far along it is toward completion.\n\n  * We can suck these work items and their statuses into a visualization tool, such as a burndown chart.\n\nFor each of these you would imagine that the process of documenting the work\nitems is going to be a bureaucratic nightmare. Well, remember our continual\ntake on bureaucracy throughout this book (it is not our friend), so we are\ngoing to use a system that is lightweight and gives us flexibility. All we\nneed to do is to be consistent in how we describe each work item. Here is our\nearlier example, now in this new format:\n\n> [tomaraya] Produce a first draft of a Code of Conduct: TODO\n\nThe format is simple. On the left, in square brackets, is the name of the\nperson the work item is assigned to (in the Ubuntu world we use the person’s\nusername). This is followed by a description of the work item, and finally a\ncolon followed by a status description in uppercase letters.\n\nWe use four different types of status:\n\nTODO\n\n    \n\nThe item has not been started.\n\nINPROGRESS\n\n    \n\nThe item is currently being worked on.\n\nDONE\n\n    \n\nThe item has been successfully completed.\n\nPOSTPONED\n\n    \n\nThe item was put on hold for some reason (e.g., the assignee left the\ncommunity, there is a lack of time or resources, etc.).\n\nBecause each work item bears one of these status descriptions, it is easy to\ncheck the current status of a given item. These simple, consistent\ndescriptions also enable us to write software tools to read in these actions\nand generate graphs, as we will discuss later.\n\nEagle-eyed readers will have noticed that our snazzy work item format does not\ninclude the deadlines we discussed earlier as being oh-so-important. This is\nbecause it makes better sense to group your work items based on their\ndeadlines as opposed to cluttering up each work item with its deadline date.\n\nAs such, I use this format:\n\n  * Work items for 09-22-2012:\n\n    * [tomaraya] Produce a first draft of a Code of Conduct: TODO\n\n    * [kerryking] Sign a contract for a $1,000 sponsor for Developer Summit Friday party: INPROGRESS\n\nHere we are specifying the date in a slightly dorkier, more computer friendly\nway so that if we want, we can read this content in with a program to display\nthe data in interesting ways.\n\n## Visualizing Data with Burndown Charts\n\nAbout three years ago I felt I was pretty organized when it came to managing\nmy team’s work and the work of the community projects I was involved in. As\ndescribed throughout this book, I would identify a _mission statement_ , and\nthen build a _strategic plan_. Back then I tracked actions in my own TODO list\ntracker and things seemed to work rather well. Part of the reason I had become\nmore organized was because my team was growing, the community was growing, and\nI needed better visibility on the projects and initiatives I was involved in.\n\nThings were getting busier, though, and I knew that would only continue. I\nneeded to handle this growth and expansion while adhering to my stubborn\nresistance to overtly bureaucratic project management techniques. I was and\nstill am entirely in favor of being on top of my projects, but there is too\nmuch _fashion_ in the project management world, and I was reluctant to change\nmy team’s workflow to use the latest project management gimmick that people\nwere talking about at conferences.\n\nAround that time, Rick Spencer joined Canonical. Rick joined as a colleague in\nthe Ubuntu Engineering Management team and we started to work together. We\nbecame fast friends as well as colleagues. While at a company conference, Rick\ndelivered a presentation explaining burndown charts. I sat in the audience,\ncurious but unconvinced. It sounded like another project management fad, so I\nignored it and carried on with my work.\n\nHowever, Rick’s presentation resonated with the other engineering managers.\nOne by one their teams started using the burndown charts that he had\npresented. This approach not only meant documenting and tracking actions as\ndescribed in this chapter, but also meant tracking this work very publicly,\nwhich the burndown charts made easy to do. In retrospect, I think the\ntransparency and visibility these charts lent to my team’s contributions also\ncontributed to my reluctance to use burndown charts. This was not because I\nwas not proud of their work, but because I was insecure about my management\nabilities.\n\nEventually, _all_ the other engineering managers were using burndown charts\nand I was the last man standing. I knew I had to give the approach a whirl,\nand boy, I am glad I did. Burndown charts have become a tremendous tool for\nhow I manage projects and coordinate work among a group of people, including\nboth paid team members and volunteer community members.\n\n### Using burndown charts\n\nSo how do these burndown charts work? Well, fortunately, they are dead simple\nto understand.\n\nLet’s assume you have identified your projects in your _strategic plan_ ,\ncreated your _blueprints_ , and documented your _work items_ across those\nblueprints. If you total up all the work items, you typically find anywhere\nfrom 21 to 210 work items assigned across a range of different people. Your\ngoal as the community leader is twofold. First, you want to help everyone who\nhas an assigned work item deliver it on time. Second, you want to communicate\nthe progress of this work effectively to onlookers (and, if relevant, to\nmanagement at your company).\n\nBurndown charts help you do this. [Figure 9-1](ch09.html#the_burndown_chart\n\"Figure 9-1. Burndown charts are an effective tool for visualizing progress.\")\nshows an example chart.\n\n![Burndown charts are an effective tool for visualizing\nprogress.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159259.png)\n\nFigure 9-1. Burndown charts are an effective tool for visualizing progress.\n\nThe burndown chart is essentially a bar chart. Along the y-axis are the total\nnumber of _work items_. Along the x-axis is the total length of time allocated\nfor all the work items to be completed. As an example, in the Ubuntu community\nwe release every six months; therefore, I target all work to a six-month\nrelease cycle and we have a six-month burndown chart.\n\nThe way the chart works is that each day a new bar is drawn on the chart from\nthe left to the right of the x-axis. This bar is broken into three different\nsections:\n\nLower, darker color\n\n    \n\nThe number of work items that are still marked as TODO and therefore have not\nbeen started.\n\nMiddle, lighter color\n\n    \n\nThe number of work items that have been marked as DONE and therefore are\ncomplete.\n\nTop, lightest color (where appropriate)\n\n    \n\nThe number of work items marked as POSTPONED, so we do not count them against\nour completion status. This color may not appear in all bars or even all\nburndown charts.\n\nEach bar that is rendered on the graph basically shows the proportion of TODO,\nDONE, and POSTPONED items. Every day a new bar is plotted on the graph to the\nright of the one from the day before.\n\nFrom the top-lefthand side of the chart to the bottom-righthand side of the\nchart is a thick black line. This is called the _trend line_. The goal of\npeople generating the burndown chart is to keep the darkest TODO area\nunderneath the trend line. If regular and consistent progress is made in\ncompleting work items throughout the period that the burndown chart\nrepresents, you will make steady progress in completing all documented work\nitems in time.\n\nSome burndown charts (such as the ones we use in the Ubuntu project) plot\nanother status, INPROGRESS, in between the TODO and DONE bars. This area\ngenerally hugs the trend line to reflect that people are actively working on\ntheir work items—unless, of course, the team is ahead or behind schedule.\n\nGenerating Your Burndown Charts\n\nIn all of this discussion about documenting work items and generating burndown\ncharts, we have not yet covered the all-important question of how you get your\nwork items to generate one of these lovely charts.\n\nFortunately, a range of options are available, including generating charts in\nBasecamp, Microsoft Excel, and other tools. I am not going to provide a list\nof links that probably will be outdated by the time you read this; instead, go\nto your favorite search engine and do a search for “generating burndown\ncharts,” and you will get a slew of results.\n\nTo generate burndown charts for the Ubuntu project, we actually wrote a few\ncustom Python scripts. We keep our work items in Launchpad and the Python\nscript just pulls out the work items and generates a graph on a web page. We\nbuilt this into a community-founded project that became _status.ubuntu.com_.\n\nThere are two primary benefits of using burndown charts. First, if you have a\nsmall piece of software that reads in the work items automatically and\ngenerates the graph, the only work your community will need to do to keep on\ntop of their work is to ensure that they update the status of the work items\nas DONE, INPROGRESS, or POSTPONED. This provides a simple, nonbureaucratic\nmethod of tracking and visualizing progress.\n\nThe second benefit is that burndown charts are a great way to demonstrate\nprogress to different stakeholders. When someone understands how a burndown\nchart works, it is possible to see progress at a few different layers. Here\nare some examples:\n\nYour team\n\n    \n\nFor the teams carrying out work items, the chart is a great way to show that\neveryone is on track. There is also no reason why a burndown chart could not\nbe generated for a specific individual. We found this really useful in the\nUbuntu project. Furthermore, there is additional data that you can present to\naugment the burndown chart (we discuss this more later).\n\nManagers and supervisors\n\n    \n\nManagers, supervisors, and other folks who either are in charge or have a\nlevel of investment in your work will be keen to see how well the projects are\nprogressing without wanting to know the details. One of the hardest skills\nwhen learning to be a manager is knowing how to differentiate between managing\ndown (maintaining visibility into the details for the team) and managing up\n(not drowning your own manager/supervisor in detail, but just providing the\nkey takeaways). When managers know how a burndown chart works, they can get a\nstatus update within seconds of looking at the chart. They are also able to\ncheck on status without asking for it, which is a huge boon for a supervisory\nposition.\n\nThe community\n\n    \n\nAnother category of folks who can get value from the burndown chart are the\ngeneral community who are not actively involved in the work encompassed by the\nchart. The major benefit here is in building confidence in you as a community\nleader for coordinating this work, and a sense that active, vibrant work is\ngoing on and being accomplished. This builds a phenomenal sense of\ntransparency, community spirit, and confidence.\n\nSo burndown charts provide a valuable means of empowering different groups of\nstakeholders to all feel connected to the progress of the project. As a nice\nside effect, I have also noticed that when a community and team understand how\nthe burndown chart system works, it really raises the sense of team spirit and\nmorale. I have found with my team that the completed burndown chart at the end\nof a cycle is something of a _shared trophy_ that we all feel proud of.\n\n### Observing burndown patterns\n\nAlthough we have covered the basics of how a burndown chart works, special\nvalues turn up over time as you get more familiar with it. One of the most\nvaluable benefits a burndown chart provides is a way to look over the duration\nof the work period and identify patterns that can help you to build on and\nimprove your work.\n\nAs an example, [Figure 9-2](ch09.html#patterns_in_burndown_charts\n\"Figure 9-2. Burndown charts are useful for both showing progress as a summary\n\\(e.g., for managers\\) and in detail \\(e.g., for your teams\\).\") shows the\nburndown chart that we looked at earlier. We can pull out a few interesting\nobservations from the chart.\n\n![Burndown charts are useful for both showing progress as a summary \\(e.g.,\nfor managers\\) and in detail \\(e.g., for your\nteams\\).](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159259.png)\n\nFigure 9-2. Burndown charts are useful for both showing progress as a summary\n(e.g., for managers) and in detail (e.g., for your teams).\n\nFirst, we can see that the completed work items are generally under the trend\nline, so the team is progressing well through the projects. There is no reason\nfor us to be concerned about the completed work items being delivered on time.\nIf the TODO items were flowing far over the trend line, it would indicate that\nthe team was behind.\n\nAnother interesting pattern is in the middle of the graph, where five of the\nbars have the same proportions. This indicates that no progress was made on\nthose days. Five bars would indicate a week (assuming the burndown chart\nrenders one bar for each workday). Take a look at what was going on when this\nhappened. This period could be a holiday season (e.g., Christmas or\nThanksgiving), in which case such a lull in progress is understandable. I have\nseen similar lulls when teams are attending conferences and other work-related\nevents and are offline and away from their usual daily work. If you are a\nmanager, however, and you are using a burndown chart for your team’s work, as\nI do at Canonical, if you see that you go on vacation for a week and the same\nkind of lull happens, your team may be slacking off while you are away.\n\nAnother interesting pattern is what happens after the lull; you can see a\nsignificant burst of progress. Again, identify what occurred at that time.\nCauses for this can be leaders and managers encouraging folks to ratchet up\nthe progress after a lull, events such as sprints or hackfests in which teams\nget together to burst through work items, or particular milestones such as the\nfinal days before a feature freeze or release. Each possibility teaches you\nsomething about your team’s productivity and how to improve it.\n\nFinally, another hugely useful pattern to observe is the proportion and\npattern of POSTPONED items. In [Figure\n9-2](ch09.html#patterns_in_burndown_charts \"Figure 9-2. Burndown charts are\nuseful for both showing progress as a summary \\(e.g., for managers\\) and in\ndetail \\(e.g., for your teams\\).\"), a small proportion of POSTPONED items\nappears in the bars on the righthand side of the chart. This tells us a few\nthings. First, seeing a growing trend of postponed items at this point in the\nchart (just over a quarter of the way through) is a concern. This would signal\nto me to keep an eye on how many work items get postponed and what the cause\ncould be. Another interesting indicator is the proportion of postponed items\nwhen the chart is completed. The number of postponed items often gives you an\nidea of whether you are agreeing to too much work in the set time period. For\nburndown charts specific to an individual and his own work items, this is a\nuseful way to see if he is overstretching himself or if you are asking too\nmuch of him.\n\n### Generating additional information\n\nEver since I started using burndown charts, I have found them to be invaluable\nin helping me to deliver value and results in the projects I am coordinating.\nEqually useful is some of the other information you may want to pull out of\nthe actions list. You will need to ensure that whatever software you are using\nto generate your burndown chart can also summarize this information.\n\nThe first piece of information is a summary of the different statuses for each\nperson who has actions assigned to him. This could be rendered as a table that\nlooks like this:\n\nName |  TODO |  INPROGRESS |  DONE |  POSTPONED  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nJames Hetfield |  3 |  6 |  8 |  1  \nSteve Harris |  2 |  3 |  6 |  2  \nRonnie James Dio |  2 |  2 |  3 |  2  \n  \nYou may also want to include a _Percentage Completed_ field for each person to\ncompare how everyone is doing relative to the whole schedule and relative to\nthe other team members. For example, if you are about halfway through the\nchart, you should reasonably expect that each person should have completed\naround 50% of his work items.\n\nAnother useful piece of data is to show the percentage complete for each\nblueprint (indicated by the total completion of its respective actions). This\nagain provides a quick means of assessing whether the project is on track.\n\n### Building burndown charts into your workflow\n\nNow that we have a fairly decent understanding of burndown charts, let’s talk\nmore about how you can build them into your own community leadership and\nmanagement workflow. No tool or management approach is going to succeed unless\nyou integrate it properly into the way you and the community work.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is get everyone on board in using burndown\ncharts. Although burndown charts are devilishly simple when you understand\nthem, at the outset they do look like big, scary, bureaucratic graphs.\nFurthermore, they require people to document their actions and keep them\nupdated with current statuses.\n\nI am going to assume here that you have decided on your _strategic plan_ ,\nfiled your _blueprints_ , and defined your _work items_. Each community had\ndifferent approaches to defining work items; some do it online in meetings,\nwhile some, like Ubuntu, do it face-to-face at a community summit. Choose\nwhich way works for you, and then you can start building this into your\nworkflow.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nOrganize weekly review meetings\n\n    \n\nEach week you should get together for a quick call or meeting with the primary\nassignees of work items and review progress. These meetings are useful for\nidentifying blockers or problems and keep progress moving along smoothly. If\nthere are too many assignees in the list, you could always ask some trusted\ncolleagues or community members to also run meetings and break up the group a\nlittle.\n\nBurndowns are breakfast reading\n\n    \n\nAt the start of your day, take a look at your burndown chart and review what\nneeds to be done next, to edge the progress along. Look for folks who seem to\nbe a little bit behind on their progress and encourage them to take a look at\ntheir work items.\n\nLook for low-hanging fruit\n\n    \n\nEvery day you should look for low-hanging fruit that can keep the chart on\ntrack. It is always better to provide some “buffer” in the chart and get a\nstack of low-hanging fruit completed, which will then free up some time for\ndelving into the more challenging or problematic areas.\n\nTry to preempt complex work items\n\n    \n\nSome work items that are supposedly small—requiring only a half day or a day\nof work, as I have recommended—will turn out to be more complex. It might\nrequire other work to be completed first, have other needs that must be met,\nor otherwise not be as simple as just getting on and doing the work. Try to\npreempt these topics earlier so that you don’t need to put the success of the\nchart over the line if you discover them at the last minute.\n\nBurndown charts are a hugely useful technique for tracking large collections\nof work at a granular level and sharing progress at a high level. We took a\nspin through the core topics here, but there is plenty of additional\ninformation online if you want to find out more.\n\n# Tracking Growth and Decline\n\nWith every _write_ community in which participants can actively contribute,\nthere is an on-ramp in which people learn the skills and knowledge they need\nto take part, and then a participation process in which their first\ncontributions are made. These new contributors are the lifeblood of your\ncommunity; they keep the train rolling forward and usher in new generations of\nparticipants who can bring value to your community. It is always important to\nkeep an eye on the growth and decline of these folks, and the critical systems\nthey use.\n\nAs community leaders, it is often tempting for us to focus heavily on creating\nnew things as opposed to effectively maintaining existing things. We like to\ncreate new initiatives and new events, generate fresh ideas, and inspire new\nthinking. While we always want to encourage this creativity, we also need to\nensure that we are keeping an eye on our existing initiatives to make sure\nthey are working, effective, and helping to deliver results in your community.\n\nThis is particularly important when you work professionally as a community\nmanager. As we have already discussed throughout this chapter, your management\nand, if applicable, senior management are likely to want to dig in here and\nthere and get an idea of how productive the community is and how effective you\nare. Earlier we talked about delivering results at a project level, in which\nyou are coordinating a team and community members to work together to bring\nvalue, but you should also strive to present an idea of how your community is\ngrowing, and how effectively your community-facing processes are working.\n\nThe first challenge is to know what to track. As we discussed earlier in the\nbook, generating statistics for the purpose of generating statistics is a bad\nthing to do. Our goal here is instead to identify how we determine value in\nour community, and to track those figures to give us an idea of where value is\nbeing created and where value is being lost.\n\nAlthough I wish I could write a big list of areas in which you should create\nmetrics, this is heavily dependent on your community. One approach that I have\ndeveloped that can help, though, is a set of questions you can ask to help you\ndetermine this set of key value judgments. Let’s look at these three\nquestions, and then I will provide an example afterward:\n\nWho contributes?\n\n    \n\nSummarize the primary classifications of the primary contributors to your\ncommunity. Divide these by the types of value they bring, primarily in terms\nof different skills.\n\nHow do they participate?\n\n    \n\nFor each type of contributor that you just wrote down, also note how each\ninteracts with your community to make those contributions. These should\nprimarily be the processes and infrastructure they use to participate.\n\nWhat do they deliver?\n\n    \n\nFor each group, write down what value they bring in a practical and measurable\nform.\n\nLet’s now look at an example. The Ubuntu community is a large one, so I am\ngoing to look at three primary groups to keep this example lean:\n\n  * Who contributes?\n\n    * Developers\n\n    * Advocates\n\n    * Translators\n\n  * How do they participate?\n\n    * Developers\n\n      * Sponsorship queue\n\n      * Developer approval process\n\n      * Bug Tracker\n\n  *     * Advocates\n\n      * LoCo teams\n\n      * loco.ubuntu.com\n\n    * Translators\n\n      * Translations interface\n\n  * What do they deliver?\n\n    * Developers\n\n      * Packages\n\n      * Bug fixes\n\n    * Advocates\n\n      * Materials\n\n      * Ubuntu events\n\n    * Translators\n\n      * Complete language translations\n\n      * Individual translated strings\n\nTo reiterate, this is a simplified view of Ubuntu in the interest of keeping\nthe example concise. This technique teases out of your community the areas in\nwhich you define value. You should be tracking growth and decline for each\narea.\n\n## Visibility Is Key\n\nBack in 2010 my team faced an interesting challenge with regard to growth.\nThis experience helped us to continue to shape our approach in how we track\ncommunity growth and gain better visibility on what is going on.\n\nEach quarter I would ask my team to prepare a summary of key community metrics\nfor the senior management team. These metrics would include things such as\ndeveloper growth (folks who build Ubuntu packages and fix bugs), forum growth,\nthe number of local user group events being organized, active levels of\nparticipation, and so on. Each quarter we would prepare the statistics, and\ngenerally they were on the uptick. For this particular quarter in 2010 I\nnoticed something slightly disconcerting: our developer growth statistics were\nbeginning to flatten out a little. They were not declining, but I saw this as\na warning shot.\n\nI immediately got on the phone with Daniel Holbach, who has the job on my team\nof growing the developer community. We discussed the possible reasons for this\nflattening effect. Were people less interested in participating in Ubuntu? Was\nour documentation too complex or sparse? Were there too few opportunities to\nparticipate? Were we not inspiring the community enough to take part? While we\ncould hypothesize about what it could be, we realized we didn’t have any solid\ndata to determine the cause for this decline.\n\nTo get better visibility, I asked Daniel to put together a survey that would\ngo out to all current developers to get a better idea of their perspectives.\nThis survey did give us some solid indicators of where we could focus. Daniel\nand I talked more and reviewed the results, but a related topic caught our\nattention: how do we support new developers wishing to get approved as\nofficial developers?\n\nIn Ubuntu you need to get approval before you can upload changes to the\narchives, so we have many contributors who perform various contributions to\nbuild trust so that they can get approved. In my discussion with Daniel, I\nrealized I had very little visibility on (a) who these folks are, (b) their\ncontributions, and (c) how we can better support them to get through the\ndeveloper process.\n\nI asked Daniel to help me get this visibility. I asked him to determine a way\nwe could generate a series of graphs of the same time period, with each graph\nshowing spikes of when and to what extent a community developer contributed to\nUbuntu. This would help give us an idea of who was performing _significant and\nsustained contributions_ , which is the basic criterion for getting approval\nas a developer.\n\nDaniel went away and figured out that he could generate these graphs by\nprocessing messages sent to the commit mailing list (a mailing list that\nautomatically gets emailed whenever a new update is made). Daniel would read\nin all these commits, weed out the approved developers, and generate graphs\nfor everyone else. [Figure\n9-3](ch09.html#visibility_of_community_contributions_is_key\n\"Figure 9-3. Visualizing the quantity and cadence of community contributions\nis a useful way to spot patterns and activity in your community members.\")\nshows some examples of these graphs (the names have been removed to protect\nprivacy).\n\n![Visualizing the quantity and cadence of community contributions is a useful\nway to spot patterns and activity in your community\nmembers.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159261.png)\n\nFigure 9-3. Visualizing the quantity and cadence of community contributions is\na useful way to spot patterns and activity in your community members.\n\nEach graph is plotted from September 19, 2008 to August 11, 2011. Each graph\nrepresents a single contributor, with the y-axis showing the number of\nsuccessful contributions they got into Ubuntu. As such, these graphs show\nreal, practical contributions made to Ubuntu and when they occurred.\n\nIn the figure, you can see that the person represented in the top graph is\nvery active. This person has made regular, significant and sustained\ncontributions to Ubuntu throughout the timeline. Therefore, this person would\nbe a strong candidate for developer approval; the regularity of contributions\ncertainly shows promise. Interestingly, though, the person’s contributions\nstop abruptly in April 2011. This could be for a variety of reasons: vacation,\nfamily issues, busy with the day job, having a child, and so on. For this\nparticular contributor I asked Daniel to reach out and check that everything\nwas OK, and to suggest that the person consider applying to be an approved\ndeveloper.\n\nThe second graph down in the figure shows a different story. This person\nstarted contributing in June 2009, then started in April 2010 to contribute\nreally heavily until about September 2010, whereupon the activity just\nstopped. In fact, this person’s activity has remained dormant for much longer\nthan the time shown in the graph. Given that the person contributed\nconsistently for over a year, this behavior is also worth checking into.\n\nThese graphs gave us considerably more insight into the different experiences\nof community members. Importantly, though, having the graphs is only part of\nthe story; if you don’t interpret the data to continue to improve your\ncommunity processes and on-ramps, you are not using the information wisely.\n\nWhen I saw these graphs, I put together a mentoring campaign to distribute a\nmentoring facility across the wider Ubuntu team. In the Ubuntu engineering\nteam we have many subteams (Desktop, Server, Foundations, Kernel, etc.). I\nassigned a member of my team to each subteam, and asked for a member of each\nsubteam to act as a community representative. With these pairs defined, we\nlooked at the list of timeline graphs, identified strong candidates for\ndeveloper approval, and distributed these folks across the teams so that\nUbuntu engineers could reach out to them and provide support. The community\nrepresentative and paired member of my team would keep on top of this work and\nreport. The result of these efforts saw a significant growth in our developer\nnumbers.\n\n## Ensuring Effective Processes\n\nEarlier I talked about when I discovered that Ubuntu’s developer growth was\nflattening a little. Our first response was to perform a survey to gather\nopinion from our approved developer community (which comprises both employees\nand community developers) to get a better idea of problematic areas.\n\nThe survey provided fascinating insight into the different perspectives on our\ndeveloper processes. Like any project, we have a set of processes defined for\nhow you contribute changes to Ubuntu, both as an approved and nonapproved\ndeveloper, how you apply to get approved, how to get security updates out for\nstable releases, and more. Many of these processes have been in place for many\nyears and the survey gave us a strong idea of the processes that were\nchallenges to our community of developers.\n\nIn the survey we asked the developers what was the most challenging and\nfrustrating element of working on Ubuntu. In other words, what should we focus\nour death ray on first?\n\nThe results came in and there was a clear, unanimous answer to this question:\n_bottlenecks_.\n\nOur developers felt they were feeding information into some processes that\nwere inserting a significant delay in returning a response or other output.\nThese developers would contribute in good faith to Ubuntu and then be met with\na frustrating delay. Not good.\n\nFortunately, we also asked the developers what they felt these bottlenecks\nwere. We also saw some unanimous feedback in answer to this question, with one\nspecific winner: the _Ubuntu Sponsorship Queue_.\n\nThe Ubuntu Sponsorship Queue is a facility we have in which unapproved\ndevelopers (those who can’t contribute changes to Ubuntu itself) can fix bugs,\ncreate functionality, and get their contributions reviewed by an approved\nUbuntu developer. It works like this:\n\n  1. Joe Bloggs finds a bug that is frustrating him. He downloads the package source code and fixes the bug. The bug no longer exists on his system and he wants to share his fix and add it to the main Ubuntu system.\n\n  2. Joe is not yet an approved developer and as such doesn’t have upload rights to contribute the bug fix directly. To submit his fix, he generates a patch for it (a file with the key code changes that fix the bug) and adds the patch to the bug report. He then adds the bug to the Ubuntu Sponsorship Queue; this is a big list of bug reports with fixes attached from nonapproved developers.\n\n  3. Sarah, who is an approved Ubuntu developer, wakes up one morning and takes a look at the sponsorship queue. She sees Joe’s fix and reviews his patch. It looks good and she uploads it to Ubuntu on Joe’s behalf. Now Joe’s fix is in Ubuntu and he has made a successful contribution.\n\nThis process relies on two key pieces to work successfully: it needs to be\nclear and easy to use for prospective developers, and it requires our existing\napproved developer base to actually go and review these contributions.\n\nThe feedback from the survey indicated that approved developers were not\nreviewing the sponsorship queue. I can understand why: these developers are\ntypically very busy with their own work, and did not have time to review other\npeople’s work, too. While this is understandable, it is also important that we\ntend to the sponsorship queue; it is the place where new generations of Ubuntu\ndevelopers make their first contributions. It doesn’t matter how fun or\nattractive we paint the picture of Ubuntu development; if someone participates\nand it takes two months to get his contributions reviewed, he will get bored\nand move on.\n\nTo get some better visibility on this, I again asked the graph-making machine,\nDaniel Holbach, to put together some graphs to show (a) the number of items on\nthe queue and (b) how long it takes to get each item tended to.\n\nThe graphs didn’t look good. The former contained a lot of items, some of\nwhich had been on there for quite some time. The sheer age of some of these\nitems was a tip-off that the latter graph would also tell a grim story: 600\nhours on average. Yikes! To be fair, this figure was not entirely\nrepresentative of the day-to-day experiences of developers, as there were so\nmany old items that skewed the figures, but there was clearly quite a delay in\ngetting many of these items reviewed.\n\nIt was clear that we needed to grow the capacity of developers who were able\nto review the content on the queue, but how could we do this when our approved\ndevelopers were already so busy?\n\nTo accomplish this, we started to focus on the Canonical staff members who\nwork on Ubuntu. We started there because we pay these people and therefore\nhave some pull when it comes to how they spend their time. We basically put\ntogether a calendar each month, and every day two staff members would spend\nhalf a day each reviewing content on the queue. We made it very clear that\ntheir responsibility was to provide an outcome for each item, even if this\nmeant not reviewing it themselves (because they may not have the domain\nexperience) but ensuring that someone else reviews it. This approach would\nmean that each staff member would need to spend only a half-day a month\ncontributing.\n\nWe shared this plan, known as the Patch Pilot plan, with others, and the\nprogress was significant. [Figure 9-4](ch09.html#tracking_processes_is_useful\n\"Figure 9-4. Tracking the hours until something is reviewed is useful for\nensuring that your community contributors get quick responses to their work.\")\nshows the average number of hours that it took sponsorship queue items to be\nreviewed during the time we were running the Patch Pilot plan.\n\n![Tracking the hours until something is reviewed is useful for ensuring that\nyour community contributors get quick responses to their\nwork.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159263.png)\n\nFigure 9-4. Tracking the hours until something is reviewed is useful for\nensuring that your community contributors get quick responses to their work.\n\nBack in December 2010 the average item would take 600 hours to be reviewed\n(again, skewed because of the sheer age of some items on the queue). A month\nlater this went down to 300 hours per item, and at the time of this writing\nthe average is around 5 hours.\n\nThis has created a significant improvement in how this community process now\noperates, but what made this possible was getting better visibility on how\nwell the process was functioning and feedback from the people who use it. This\nhelped us to tease the problem apart a little more, put some measurements in\nplace, apply a scheme to repair these issues, and track progress.\n\nHiding In Plain Sight\n\nA key lesson I learned from this experience was to not assume that as a\ncommunity manager you will know where the bottlenecks and challenges in your\ncommunity may lurk. Often these challenges are hiding in plain sight, and\nwhile you may hear grumblings here and there, it is often only when you hear a\nchorus of complaints that the problem becomes a priority.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with the Ubuntu Sponsorship Queue. I had heard\nsome complaints here and there about it, but when we saw a chorus of opinion\nshared from folks with strong credibility (our developers), the problem took\non a new light.\n\nThe lesson here is to regularly reach out to your community and get their\nfeedback on areas that are working well and not-so-well. This will equip you\nwith knowledge of the problem, and then you can shine a light on it and raise\nthe visibility to resolve the issues.\n\n# Tracking Health\n\nSo far in this chapter we have explored how we can keep track of the very\nmeasurable components of community. Tracking projects and work items and\nkeeping an eye on contributor growth and participation is useful for filling\nin some of the blanks, but some parts of our communities are less structured\nand less measurable. Unfortunately, many community leaders often ignore these\nareas and see dire consequences down the road.\n\nThis section looks at the general health of your community. You may be\ntracking your projects well and seeing growth in your participants, but are\nthese participants happy and satisfied with their contributions? Do they feel\nconfident in you and, where appropriate, the company that is investing so\nheavily in the community? These are some tough questions to answer, and\nkeeping track of this health typically can’t be achieved by generating graphs.\n\nOne key lesson that I have learned over the years is that no matter how open\nand approachable you strive to be, your community will not always feel\nentirely comfortable sharing some of their concerns with you.\n\nI have always tried to be very approachable and open to feedback in my work.\nBack when I started out as a manager I remember thinking to myself how I\nwanted to be a different kind of boss. I wanted to be someone who could bring\nleadership and support to the table, but also be loose and fun to hang out\nwith. As the years have gone by, I have generally been satisfied with the way\nI have managed the team, and having such a wonderful group of reports has\nsignificantly helped with this. Sure, there have been some times when I have\nhad to crack the whip or discipline members of the team (or they have had to\ndiscipline me), but these cases have been few and far between.\n\nAs my career with community leadership has continued, I have tried to take a\nsimilar approach to community management. I have always strived to help our\ncommunity be successful, help resolve problems and concerns, and hang out and\nsocialize with the community as friends. In my mind it is just as important to\nshoot the crap with the community as it is to interact with them around\nprojects and work items, and create positive outcomes. I have always tried to\nencase this work with a very frank and honest approach so that the community\ncan trust me as a friend as well as a community leader.\n\nAt one point I started getting a little too complacent in this approach. I\nfelt I was being nice and friendly and open, always keen to hear the\ncommunity’s thoughts, and always being receptive to feedback, and this led me\nto the false sense of security that if there was a problem, someone would tell\nme about it for sure. I am just another one of the guys and girls, right?\nSomeone will just drop me an email and we will be good to go? Not quite.\n\nWriting this paragraph is tough, and I almost feel embarrassed to write it.\nLet me put it this way: in all communities, community leaders are often seen\nas having a certain amount of…celebrity. Now let’s put this in perspective.\nThis is typically celebrity in a _very small fishbowl_. Being well known in a\nsmall community does not transpose to general celebrity, nor does it\nlegitimize acting like you have general celebrity. I find it nauseating when\npeople say that I am a “celebrity” or “famous,” because that isn’t true. What\nI do acknowledge is that I am well known within a certain community of people.\n\nNow, some of you will like the idea of this. Feeling like a celebrity has to\nbe fun, right? There is no doubt that the _Cheers_ effect of “everybody knows\nyour name” is nice, but always keep this in perspective. Unfortunately, I have\nmet far too many community leaders who don’t keep it in perspective and they\nwalk around with a smug attitude to their work. No one likes that,\nparticularly your community members. Remember, folks, being known in a small\nfishbowl is not “celebrity” or “fame.”\n\nRegardless of how it should be, many of your community members will\nunfortunately see you as a celebrity. This will almost always have the effect\nof making you slightly less approachable, no matter how open you are. Some\nmembers of your community simply won’t entirely relax around you, and there is\nnothing wrong with that. What is important to remember is that issues and\nproblems may be happening in the community and someone may not tell you.\n\nSo the challenge is, how do we get the visibility on areas of community health\neven if people feel uncomfortable telling us?\n\n## Promoting a Feedback Culture\n\nOne of my biggest fears is that a set of opinions or concerns about my work\nare circulating and no one has the confidence to tell me. My fear is that\nthese concerns and opinions would continue to flow and be shared with people\nand I would be none the wiser, and as such unable to show a receptivity to the\nfeedback and to try to resolve the concerns where appropriate.\n\nIn some of our relationships, providing this kind of feedback is expected. I\nexpect my manager to tell me when he thinks I can do a better job. Likewise,\nmy team should expect that I will tell them when they should be doing a better\njob. But what about me telling my manager how to improve? How about my team\ntelling me? What about the feedback from my manager’s manager about me; should\nhe censor it before it comes to me? How should I communicate concerns from my\nmanagement peers about my team?\n\nThings get even more complicated when it comes to community. How should\ncommunity members express feedback to you? How do they express feedback about\nyour team or your manager? How do you handle feedback from community members\nabout another member?\n\nI have always taken a very simple approach to my relationship with others: if\nthere is ever _any_ concern about my work, I want to know. If I don’t know\nabout it I simply can’t fix it.\n\nThe first day I work for a new manager or a new member joins my team, I always\nemphasize this point. My wife and I even have this agreement with each other;\nwe call it our _full disclosure_ policy. I make it clear to all of these\npeople that I don’t want the feedback censored or deflected, I don’t want to\nbe protected from feedback outside of my pay grade; I want to hear the details\nso that I can react and resolve the problem appropriately. Of course, this is\nall entirely selfish: I need to know that my peers are being frank with me;\notherwise, I would descend into my biggest fear and become a paranoid wreck.\n\nIt is important to communicate this policy not just to your managers, teams,\nand partners, but also to the community. I have gone to great lengths in the\npast in my work to make it expressly clear that feedback is always welcome,\nbut just saying this is not enough. It is important to demonstrate your\nreceptivity to feedback. A community, like any group of people, is always\nprone to sharing stories and gossiping about other people. As a community\nleader you are going to be the prime rib in that particular meal, and you want\nto ensure that your community has a strong set of positive stories that they\ncan share with one another about you.\n\nAs such, you need to demonstrate openness to feedback. Here are some tips:\n\nDocument the feedback loop\n\n    \n\nWrite a full and frank article (such as a blog entry) about how you are\nentirely open to feedback, suggestions, and criticism. When you document your\nattitude, the community can share the article among themselves. It also\nprovides you with a definitive way to say that you are open to feedback.\n\nRespect privacy\n\n    \n\nNothing kills a feedback process like people entrusting their concerns to you\nand then you breaking that confidence with someone else. Such breaches will\nbecome well known quickly, so always respect privacy as the highest priority.\n\nAdmit when you are wrong\n\n    \n\nThis may be the hardest element to handle for some of you. The purest\ndefinition of proving you are open to feedback is admitting that you are\nwrong, both on a personal and a public level. Unfortunately, some see a public\nadmittance to a mistake as a weakness; most, however, recognize a measure of\nmaturity and decency in such statements. Of course, don’t issue a fake apology\nto generate this effect; your community will see right through that. Make sure\nyour apology is real and you mean it. Also, when you do admit when you are\nwrong, credit the community for raising the issue where appropriate; this is\nanother way to prove that you are open to feedback.\n\nMake change happen\n\n    \n\nAnother subtle but key point is that if concerns are shared about something in\nthe community, be sure to be responsive and bring a solution to the table. If\nyour community continually provides feedback and nothing ever changes, they\nwill stop providing feedback at some point.\n\nIf you take a very open, responsive, and reactive approach to feedback, your\ncommunity will not only give you more feedback about their experiences in the\ncommunity, but also respect you more for your attitude and honesty in\naccepting and resolving issues where they occur.\n\nIdentifying Areas of Visibility\n\nSome of you may be asking which particular areas you should be looking at when\nit comes to general community health.\n\nUnfortunately, in much the same way as it is difficult for me to advise you on\nareas to track for growth and decline, the same applies to community health;\nit is largely dependent on your specific community. You should look at the\nprimary ways your community operates, assess how you would describe a healthy\ncommunity, and focus on those points.\n\nOne piece of advice I would tender, though, is that you focus on getting\nvisibility on the primary areas you feel in the dark about right now. As an\nexample, you may never spend any time with the documentation team, so this\nmeans you don’t have a decent sense of how healthy the team is. Sit down and\nthink of all the teams and areas where you feel like you don’t have a good\nhandle on how well things are working.\n\nDrilling into these areas will help spread your radar around your community\nand augment the knowledge you have about the parts of the community into which\nyou have visibility, giving you a more complete picture.\n\n## Building a Set of Generals\n\nIn 2008 I moved to California. When I moved there my entire schedule turned\naround. In England I would typically be on the phone in the afternoons with\nfolks in the United States and have a few calls earlier in the afternoon with\nUK and European folks. Upon moving to California that all changed. I was now\nup every morning at 7 a.m. or 7:30 a.m. to start calls with Europe.\n\nAs my job got more complex and my team grew, my calls grew, too. I was getting\nto a point where I was on the phone for 22 hours a week. Like many folks who\nget into a similar situation, I tried to cull many of these calls that could\nbe accomplished over email. Unfortunately, this didn’t cut it down very much.\nI needed a weekly call with each member of my team, a general team call, a\nweekly call with my manager, my management call, and regular calls with key\nstrategic teams and community members. Even when I culled the calls down, I\nwas still clocking up at least 17 hours a week on the phone.\n\nThis time on the phone meant that my inbox started ballooning, too. As soon as\nI was finished with calls I would hit the email, and then finally I could get\non with the work I had to accomplish. The net result of all of this activity\nwas that my week became far more compressed and time became a precious\ncommodity.\n\nAll of this had one unfortunate impact: I found it harder to get a feel for\nthe general health of the community. I was spending so much time on the damn\nphone and in email that I didn’t have as much time to talk to the community,\nand there were important projects I felt we needed to move forward on that I\njust didn’t have time to participate in. With little time available, I was\nstuck between a rock and a hard place; how on earth do I get more things done\nwith no time available?\n\nTo help resolve this, I tried a new approach which has become an invaluable\nway of providing me with a better feel for the challenges in the community and\nof giving certain community teams more of my support. I refer to this as\n_building a set of generals_.\n\nThe idea is simple: you just identify the teams you wish you could spend more\ntime with and identify leaders in those teams who you can have regular calls\nwith.\n\nAs an example, the Ubuntu LoCo Team community is filled with advocates who\nform local user groups to go out and spread the word about Ubuntu. I believe\nthese teams are critically important in our success; they are our troops on\nthe ground. With this in mind, I could see that Laura Czajkowski, a member of\nthe LoCo Council governance board, was doing some excellent work, so I invited\nher to have a regular call with me. This gave me some incredible insight into\nwhat was going on in the LoCo community at a governance level, and Laura would\noften expose blockers and issues in moving forward on which I could provide\nsome guidance. The relationship was very positive and it brought real value to\nboth of us.\n\nAs time went on, we expanded the call to include some other LoCo leaders who\nwork on the infrastructure side of the LoCo community. As a team we would\nagree on a set of goals, and the participants on the call would be doing much\nof the work. My primary function was to keep our eyes on the prize and ensure\nthat the train would move forward. As a result of this work, some great value\nwas brought to the LoCo teams from these community members.\n\nI have set up these calls with a variety of different teams and have found\nthat each time this approach has been really successful. In many ways it is\nalmost as if the community member I am on the call with is an extended member\nof the team I manage at the company, and many of the similarities in terms of\nhow I work with my team are applied to the community calls: identifying\nopportunities and problems, defining work items, unblocking issues, and so on.\n\n### Note\n\nOne word of caution in putting together these calls: some community members\nmay see a regular call with the community leader or manager as something of a\n_status symbol_ with other members. This can also arise if you extend your\ncalls to include additional participants; there may be some blowback if a\ncommunity member feels the presence of additional folks indicates the pure\none-on-one calls are of lower value.\n\nOn the flip side, those folks who do not have regular calls with you may\nexhibit some jealousy or frustration over this. Just be a little careful when\ncommunicating how and with whom you have these calls; try to be as inclusive\nas possible.\n\n# Reacting to Community Concerns\n\nAt some point in your community leadership adventure you are going to face the\nequivalent of villagers with pitchforks. This will typically happen at a time\nof stress, uncertainty, or concern, but you may find members of your community\nexpressing frustrations about the structure or operation of the community.\nSometimes these concerns can be expressed loudly, as a result of unspoken\nfrustration, and sometimes with a severity that outweighs the issue in\nquestion. In other words, you may find yourself getting a kicking from your\ncommunity because they are unhappy about something.\n\nUnless you are noncommunicative with your community, these expressions of\nfrustration typically arise from a small group of people and are not\nnecessarily reflective of the wider community; you will likely pick up strong\nundercurrents of problems. Regardless, you should treat these concerns and\nfrustrations with seriousness, dignity, and respect.\n\nNow, astute readers that you are, you may be wondering why I am discussing\nwhat seems like conflict resolution in this chapter, and not leaving it until\n[Chapter 11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\").\nThis section is less about the process of handling conflict than it is about a\nstructured approach to responding to concerns, which involves gathering and\nmeasuring data and is therefore pertinent to this chapter.\n\nThe rule of thumb here is that, in times of distress, you should be respectful\nand responsive and strive to find the problems so that you can provide\nsolutions and reassurance. Let me give you an example.\n\nSome time ago I was quietly working one day when my chat program lit up like a\nChristmas tree. There was a community meeting going on at the time and a small\ngroup of people were complaining about some elements of how the community was\nfunctioning. Someone asked if these concerns had been raised with Jono, hence\nthe activity on my chat program. So I joined the discussion to learn more\nabout the concerns.\n\nFrom reading the discussion thus far, the concerns expressed were vague and\nunspecific. There were clearly frustrations, but the group didn’t provide\nspecifics that I could act on to remedy (“The damn car doesn’t work and this\nreally sucks” as opposed to “The car engine won’t turn over”).\n\nMy first instinct was to ask the group lots of questions to learn more. I have\nalways been conscious that, as a community leader, I won’t know the full\nextent of what’s annoying your community, just as a team may not express\ncertain concerns to their manager. I was also aware that a community leader\noften has a different perspective and community experience from that of a\nregular community member, and the last thing I wanted to do was to presume\nwhat the problem was. As such, I threw out a stack of questions in the\nmeeting.\n\nThis was a mistake.\n\nThrowing out these questions at a time of frustration sounded more like an\ninquisition than the receptive information gathering I intended it to be.\nSensing the building frustration, I assured the group that I was taking their\nconcerns seriously and I would follow up with further action soon. This would\ngive them the reassurance that I cared, along with some time for those who\nwere frustrated to cool down before I reached out for more information.\n\nI was now in a position where I had a vague set of concerns that were clearly\nfrustrating some members of the community, but I had no idea to what extent\nthe community was feeling these concerns (was it a small minority or a wider\nissue?) and what the specific causes of the concerns were. Without this\ninformation I could not build solutions to the problems.\n\nI needed more information, but knew it needed to come from good sources, not\nbe a poll open to everyone and his dog. One of the challenges with surveys is\nthat the data needs to be credible; a survey filled in by random opinionated\npeople on the Internet is not as valuable as one filled in by trusted and\nestablished community members. As such, I prepared a survey that asked about\nsome of the concerns raised in the meeting and sent the survey to all\nofficially recognized members of the community. I deliberately kept as many of\nthe questions open-ended as possible (as opposed to multiple choice) to give\nthe respondents the most freedom of expression; the last thing I wanted to do\nwas to limit their feedback.\n\nI sent out the survey and waited a few weeks for the community to respond. I\nassured the community that I would publish a report in full and that together\nas a community we could use the survey as a solid chunk of data to help us\nbuild solutions to these issues. Throughout this process I blogged about my\nreceptivity to the concerns, the issuing of the survey, and my encouragement\nto all community members to provide their input and to be as full and frank as\npossible.\n\nWhen the survey was complete, I summarized each question into a report, and\nfor the open-ended questions (e.g., “What motivates you about the\ncommunity?”), I summarized the common patterns and themes in the responses. I\nwas conscious of providing solid data and to not massage or influence the\nperception of the results. I also included the full responses to all the\nquestions, anonymized to ensure that people could be fully open in their\nresponses.\n\nThe survey results were fascinating. Not only did they identify that many of\nthe concerns were indeed not particularly representative of the wider\ncommunity, which was reassuring, but also they highlighted other areas of\ngrowing concern and other areas in which people particularly enjoy\nparticipating or find the community motivating.\n\nThis was good, solid data, and I published it immediately.\n\nThe community started reviewing and presenting their own views on how to read\nthe data and what potential solutions we could create. I joined in those\nconversations and could tell that the tone had changed from frustration to a\nshared sense of ownership of the challenges. The atmosphere became more\nempowering and was positive about fixing the issues outlined; the visibility\nof the issues clearly provided a sense of having the problem in our sights so\nthat we could understand and solve them.\n\nBuilding on this momentum, we held a face-to-face community event in the\nfollowing few weeks and I organized a series of discussion sessions to review\nthe content in the survey, discuss the topics there, and put together\nsolutions. Over the following weeks we started to see many of the issues\nfading away and the community feeling more involved and empowered.\n\nTo be honest, this whole experience was stressful as hell. As a community\nleader, you always want to feel accomplished in your work and tend to feel a\nvery personal sense of responsibility for your community’s happiness. I take\nany concerns like this (even if they were from a small group such as this)\nvery personally. I became very reflective of myself, did some soul-searching,\nreviewed how I approached my work and the community, and what presumptions I\nmade. I basically questioned everything I was doing, and while stressful, I am\nglad it happened; it helped me to take a fresh perspective and recalibrate\nsome elements of our community.\n\n# Moving On\n\nThis chapter has been all about how to track and measure our work. Many of the\nskills and experiences highlighted here are things that I have learned over\nthe years as I have faced new challenges and opportunities, and learned better\nways of solving some problems that I faced in my work. The chapter provides a\ngood grounding for getting started, but always be open to your own context and\nhow you meet the needs of that context. You will find your own approaches and\ntechniques that will build on and in some cases replace the approaches here.\nThis chapter is a start, not an end to this process.\n\n\n# Chapter 10. Governance\n\n“Which is the best government? That which teaches us to govern ourselves.”\n\n—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nMike Basinger is a nice guy. Some would say a little too nice for his own\ngood: he is one of those people who are impossible to dislike, no matter how\nmuch you try. Quiet, conscientious, considerate, and understated, Mike is the\nepitome of the open source community. Few would imagine that he helps to\ngovern the worldwide Ubuntu community at the highest level. At the same time,\nmany of the people who know that don’t realize that Mike has never worked for\nCanonical Ltd., Ubuntu’s commercial sponsor; he has always remained a\nvolunteer.\n\nBack in 2005, Mike joined the Ubuntu community by throwing himself into the\nbustling Ubuntu Forums soon after switching to Ubuntu. The forums were a good\nfit for him. Mike has a passion for helping people with technical problems. He\nloves the thrill of the chase: hunting down those pesky issues and helping to\nfix them for appreciative community members. As a good community citizen, Mike\nwas on the front line helping new Ubuntu users get acclimated to their new\nwaters.\n\nThe forums became stunningly popular. Thousands and thousands of excitable\ncommunity members joined, and each day pages of conversation on all manner of\ntopics would flow throughout the site. Interestingly, unlike most other Linux\ndistribution forums, the Ubuntu Forums were not created by the commercial\nsponsor (in this case Canonical Ltd.). Instead, the Ubuntu Forums were created\nby Ryan Troy, a passionate user who wanted to build an environment in which\nany Ubuntu user could ask for help and talk to other users.\n\nAs the forums grew, their popularity generated a few bumps in the road, and\nthey needed increasing organizational focus. New moderators needed to be\nappointed, frustrating conflict issues were becoming more common due to the\nsize and diversity of the forum membership, administrators needed to\ndistribute maintenance matters, and there was increasing demand for the forums\nto integrate with other parts of the Ubuntu community. The forums needed\ngoverning, and who should be one of the people to step up to the plate? One\nMike Basinger.\n\nOver the following months, the Forums Council was designed, documented, and\nultimately approved by the main Ubuntu Community Council. Alongside his peers\non the Forums Council, Mike took the lead to govern. He and they did an\nexcellent job, and Mike continued to contribute throughout the community.\n\nIn March 2007, the highest governing body in the Ubuntu community, the\nCommunity Council, was preparing to elect a new board of governing members.\nClearly impressed with Mike’s contributions to the Forums Council and\nelsewhere, Mark Shuttleworth (the leader of the Ubuntu project) asked Mike if\nhe would consider a nomination to the Community Council. Somewhat stunned yet\nflattered, Mike considered Mark’s suggestion and then agreed to be put forth\nas a nomination.\n\nJust before the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Seville in southern Spain, Mark\nannounced the nominees for the Community Council. The four nominees were put\nbefore a Yes/No vote by all approved Ubuntu Members, and Mike was elected to\nthe Community Council in May 2007. It was a good day for Ubuntu, and it was a\ngood day for Mike.\n\nFrom his beginnings as a volunteer contributor like any other, Mike had risen\nto one of the most powerful roles in the Ubuntu community. This is entirely\ndue to his hard and careful work and his commitment and devotion to the spirit\nand community of Ubuntu. When I asked him what kept him excited about Ubuntu\nthroughout this period, he shared his clear passion for Ubuntu and the\nopportunities it has opened up for him:\n\n> What excites me about the community governance is the sense that Ubuntu is a\n> community of thousands of people from every country, race, sex, and religion\n> who have gotten together and said, “We want computing to be this way.” Linux\n> and open source have enabled this as opposed to what Microsoft or Apple\n> tells you. It is the sense that our community’s governance is open and\n> anyone who wants to contribute can and has a say in the direction of Ubuntu.\n> It is that the community’s main focus is to help each other, whether that\n> means writing code, creating documentation, or answering questions from our\n> users.\n\nI am intensely proud of Mike’s experience. Stories like this illustrate the\npower and opportunity of community to build methods of collaboration and\ngovernance that are empowering and rewarding. Stories like this make community\nleaders feel all warm and fuzzy. They also make us community leaders unusually\ngenerous in a bar. If a community manager offers to buy you a pint some day,\nit’s likely that something such as this has just happened....\n\n# Accountability\n\nA significant contributing factor in Mike’s success is that he feels a genuine\nand very real sense of accountability and responsibility for his work and for\nUbuntu as a whole.\n\nIn volunteer environments, participation is optional. Some of your volunteers\nwill spend every day plugged into your community, and some will contribute\nwhenever they please. Unfortunately, the latter form of drive-by contributors\ncan’t support many of the responsibilities and leadership components in a\ncommunity. If you want to release a software product and commit publicly to a\nrelease date, you want to ensure that whatever happens, your volunteers feel a\nvery personal sense of commitment to achieving that goal. Likewise, if your\ncommunity appoints members to lead and govern the community, they must feel\nand exhibit a strong sense of responsibility and commitment. In short, you\nwant people to feel accountable for their actions: you want them to _make\ntime_ when the community is under the gun to achieve something.\n\nAccountability is a valuable asset. It is as close to a declaration of\ncommitment that you will get in a community. Some of your members will feel\nthis sense of accountability and some won’t. Those who do are a valuable\nresource; you should entrust them with responsibility, but don’t take\nadvantage of their sense of accountability.\n\nAs community leaders, we should be laden with a sense of accountability. We\nare trusted to guide and inspire the community to move forward, and we should\nfeel that responsibility in a very real way. With that sense of accountability\nis a responsibility to listen and learn. Our communities seek not only\nleadership from us, but also substance when it comes to governance. A great\ncommunity makes it simple and enjoyable for a member to contribute to its\ntasks, and to contribute to this governance. This is the goal of this chapter.\n\n# Governance Does Not Suck\n\nOf all the topics that fall under the umbrella of community leadership,\ngovernance is one of the most important yet most misunderstood. In the\ntraditional sense, we are all intimately familiar with governance: it is\nexemplified by the government of your country. Your government is the\nrepresentative body that manages the nation’s resources and deals with its\nproblems, opportunities, and current affairs. For most of us, our experience\nof government is the legislation, processes, and laws that define our daily\nlives, and those who perform this governance are the suited and booted\npoliticians who populate our newspapers, television news shows, and radio\nbroadcasts. We are all familiar with our governments, and we all have an\nopinion about them.\n\nUnfortunately, opinion often points south, and governments get something of a\nbad reputation. It is easy to see why: the media is littered with stories of\nincompetence, sleaze, and self-interest, largely defended by toadying\npolicymakers who refuse to provide a straight answer to a straight question.\nWhen government leaders are queried by journalists, TV anchors, and\nresearchers, it is not uncommon for the subjects of the governance (the\ncitizens) to view the whole shebang with an air of suspicion: a government\nseen as fundamentally disconnected from the people. In a manner of speaking,\nit can be easy to draw the conclusion that all governments essentially suck.\n\nUnfortunately, many citizens are so frustrated and disappointed by the\nincompetence in their government that they see the very concept of government\nas fatally flawed, as a system that fails to engage with its people with a\nraft of promises, few of which are faithfully kept.\n\nOf course, this view is nonsense. The concept of selecting a few to\neffectively govern the many works, and we should not allow the incompetence of\nspecific individuals to tarnish the potential of the system. In many cases we\nnever get to hear about the amazing work of government, just the scandals and\nfailed initiatives.\n\nFor years many governments have successfully delivered radical change and\nimprovements to their people. Consider the rebuilding of Europe after World\nWars I and II, expanding the right to vote, equal access to public\naccommodations, reducing disease, reducing workplace discrimination,\nlegislation around safe food and drinking water, the nationwide construction\nof highways, financial security in retirement, scientific funding and\ntechnical research, reducing hunger and improving nutrition, space\nexploration, and more. It is government that helped forward these worthy\nachievements. When the system works, beautiful things can happen.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> The Drupal community uses a do-ocracy model, meaning people work on what\n> they want to work on, instead of being told what to work on.

Instead of ensuring clean drinking water, community governance\nensures transparency in our deadlines. Instead of readily available health\ncare, we strive for robust resources to do our work. Instead of building that\nfreeway, we build effective and open communication processes. The issues may\ndiffer, but the primary function of representing and maintaining the interests\nof those you govern remains.\n\nOf course, governance is an epic and often academic topic. Thousands of books,\nresearch papers, and understudies have sought to understand, rationalize, and\nquantify what makes great governance. As a result, much of the available\nteaching is outrageously complex and written for those who have devoted their\nlives to understanding the subject.\n\nI have _not_ committed my life to governance, I have never served a\nprofessorship in governance, and I don’t plan to do so. I am a community\nmanager, not a governor, and I would rather spend my time helping my community\nbe effective than reading a library full of theory on governance.\n\nLike many of you, what I seek to understand is how I can ensure that my\ncommunity will be governed well. I want to cut to the chase: what are the\nimportant elements to focus on in building a smooth and efficient governance\nstructure?\n\nIn this chapter, we are going to uncover these elements. We are going to\nexplore the aims and intentions of great governance, look at different\napproaches, and then discuss how to produce your own governance bodies. To\nseal the deal I am going to provide an extensive case study of how the Ubuntu\ngovernance structure works: this can be an excellent basis in which to roll\nout your own approach.\n\nLet’s roll....\n\n# The Case for Governance\n\nAlthough I may appear to be a lighthearted guy on the outside, inside burns a\ncynical Englishman. Like many others, I have a blacklist of irritants in life.\nHovering near the bottom of the list are bad customer salespeople, above that\nare those objects that attract the full velocity of my little toe when I walk\nbarefoot in my house, then sycophantic reality TV imbeciles, and, bobbing\naround the top of the list, people who jump too quickly to governance.\n\nGovernance is not a rite of passage for community. It is not an expected norm,\nand its absence is not something that is perceived as immaturity. Before we\nbegin exploring the nuances of governance, we need to determine if you need\ngovernance in the first place.\n\nAt the end of the day, only your community should judge whether governance is\nrequired and what form it will take. There are, however, some indicators that\nsuggest that a governing body could be useful to have in place:\n\nSize of the community\n\n    \n\nOne of the first indicators that governance may be required is that your\ncommunity grows extensively. If you have a community of around 10 people,\ngovernance is probably not required. If you have a community of 100\ncontributors (not users/consumers/onlookers) or more, it becomes a more\npressing consideration. If you exceed the 1,000 mark, you should strongly\nconsider governance, and possibly muscle relaxants, too.\n\nIncreasing conflict\n\n    \n\nConflict resolution is a primary responsibility in governance. You should be\ncareful about what you consider real conflict, though. People disagreeing on a\nfew things is not conflict. People having full arguments in which multiple\npeople are involved and factions develop is a far more serious issue. When\nthis happens, sometimes the different sides hit an impasse and can’t move\nforward. Governance can really help here, under the proviso that the community\nrespects the conclusions of the governance body.\n\nExtensive resources\n\n    \n\nIf you find that your community requires significant resources and some of\nthese resources are donated, you may require a governing body to oversee the\nstewardship of these resources. An example of this could include a software\nproject such as the [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) project, which requires\nextensive resources such as servers, hosting, build farms, and more.\n\nCommercial interests\n\n    \n\nWhen there are commercial interests in a community, a governance body can be\nuseful to ensure that the community is “kept honest.” The governance body\nshould be tasked with the responsibility of always maintaining and defending\nthe primary values of the community and standing up against any improper\nrequests that may result from commercial sponsors.\n\nIf some of these elements apply to your community, it would be worth\nconsidering governance in more detail. Let’s now expand on this introduction\nand explore some of the responsibilities that governing bodies can provide,\nand consider how this could apply to your own community.\n\nTo ensure that we focus our minds on these important topics, I am going to\nrevisit the approach from earlier in the book when we built a Community TODO\nList to remember which items were important in growing strong community. Our\nlist will look a little like this:\n\norm:swap-title: Governance TODO List\n\n  * _Item._\n\n  * _Item._\n\n  * ....\n\n## Follow the Leader\n\nThe primary responsibility of a governance body is to lead. It is there to\ninitiate and engage in a conversation about topics that affect the community\nas a whole and represent the best interests of that community. A governing\nbody seeks to understand and make decisions that are representative of the\ncommunity, its goals, and its culture.\n\nFor many communities, leadership is broken into a few different threads that\npull in the same direction to form a diversely detailed governing body. Just\nas a conventional government will have leaders and departments that focus on\nspecific areas (e.g., Department of Health, Department of Employment), many\ncommunities divide their leadership, too.\n\nFor most communities, this leadership is divided as follows:\n\nGeneral governance\n\n    \n\nDecisions that need to be made around general topics that apply to the\ncommunity as a whole. This could include things such as how people join the\ncommunity, resources and infrastructure, community-wide policies and\nprocedures, governance changes, and so on.\n\nDirection\n\n    \n\nDecisions about the goals, ambitions, and focus of the community. As an\nexample, with a software project, this kind of leadership would decide which\nfeatures to aim for in the next release. In a local civil rights group, this\ncould be how the group is planning to raise awareness and which campaigns will\nbe organized.\n\nSpecialist governance\n\n    \n\nThis really applies only to larger communities. Specialized governance may be\nrequired in specific areas of expertise. As an example, in a software\ncommunity the developer community may require its own governance, and so may\nthe discussion forums.\n\nFor many communities, each type of leadership falls together inside a single\ngovernance body. This is particularly common in smaller communities.\n\nFor example, many user groups have a known collection of leaders who advise\nand govern around all manner of topics, including how people can join the\ngroup, how the group should focus their efforts, which campaigns should be\nworked on, how money and assets are handled, and more. It is often the same\nsmall set of people who advise on these issues, and the expertise and more\ngeneral focus of a user group makes this kind of simple approach a perfect\nsolution.\n\nFor larger or more specialized communities, these separate leadership roles\nare often divided into different governance bodies. As an example, in the\nUbuntu community we have the following governance bodies:\n\n  * Community Council→General Governance\n\n  * Technical Board→Direction (technical direction and processes)\n\n  * Team Councils→Specialist Governance (e.g., the Forums Council governs the Ubuntu Forums)\n\nIf this approach piques your interest, you should be tickled pink to learn\nthat I will be providing a detailed summary of how Ubuntu is governed later in\nthis chapter. We will look at the structure of its governance, crack it open,\nand see how it works. Let’s now add our first item to our Governance TODO\nList.\n\norm:swap-title: Governance TODO List\n\n  * Ensure that your community is governed in terms of General Governance, Direction, and (if applicable) Specialist Governance.\n\n## Engage the People\n\nGovernments are, fundamentally, representatives of the people, and for this\nrepresentation to be fair and accurate, the government needs to engage with\nthe people. A government that lowers itself into a silo and rarely interacts\nwith its people is doomed to a future riddled with problems. If a government\nfails to communicate with its people, the people will not only lose faith in\nthose who govern, but also lose faith in the confidence of being governed in\nthe first place.\n\nGeorge Burns, the famous American comedian, replete with arched eyebrow and\ncigar smoke punctuation, had a lot to say about government. In a 1979 issue of\n_Life_ magazine, Burns shared a nugget of insight that resonated with many\npeople:\n\n> Too bad that all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving\n> taxicabs and cutting hair.\n\nHe isn’t wrong. When I started my career in community management, I spent a\nlot of time traveling. At OpenAdvantage I would hurl myself across Europe from\nconference to conference, and my move to Canonical expanded my travel to the\nworldwide stage. As I moved from plane to plane, and ate miniature bag after\nminiature bag of salted peanuts, I went to meet and greet the various members\nof my community. While en route, I had my own opportunity to meet a battalion\nof taxi drivers, each with his own carefully considered manifesto of what his\ngovernment had screwed up and the rather obvious solution to the problem. I\nheard views on Chinese politics in San Francisco, opinions of US trade\ntreaties in Prague, and just about everyone had a view on George W. Bush. I\nsuspect that that man doesn’t get as many Christmas cards as he used to....\n\nVirtually all of these taxi drivers had one thing in common: they all felt\ntheir voice was rarely heard by their governments. Their right to vote was\nalways cherished, but it was seen as a binary decision around favor or\nrejection. These always-entertaining cabbies weren’t asking for much, they\njust wanted to be able to have a conversation with their governments, and so\nthey should.\n\nGreat communities always have a close connection between the governing bodies\nand the members of the community. This relationship requires more than a\ncommunication channel with the governance body; that part is simple. Real\nengagement is when government and community enter into a two-way conversation.\nGone should be the days in which the government dictates to the people. Today\ngovernance should focus its heart on engaging in conversation with its\nmembers. Whether you call it shooting the breeze, having a good ol’ chin-wag,\nor anything else, you need to be having it with the people who govern you.\n\nIt is likely you are going to be governing others, and as such we need to\nensure that we are cognizant of engaging in conversation with our communities.\nLet’s put this on our list.\n\norm:swap-title: Governance TODO List\n\n  * Ensure that your community is governed in terms of General Governance, Direction, and (if applicable) Specialist Governance.\n\n  * Build communication channels between the governance body and those whom they govern.\n\n  * Foster a culture in which the members of the community can engage in conversation, debate, and discussion with their governing bodies.\n\n## Aspire to Inspire\n\nEvery community looks to its governing members for direction and advice, and\nleadership helps to ensure that the community is on the right path and feeling\nproductive and nimble. A very close cousin of leadership is inspiration. Your\nmembers will also look to you to inspire, motivate, and enthuse them. If you\nmake the hairs on the backs of their necks stand on end when you lay out your\nvision and what you want accomplished, your community will succeed.\n\nInspiration is an important responsibility for leaders. Earlier in this book\nwe spent some time discussing how to write inspiring words for your community.\nUnfortunately, some community leaders who work to build governance bodies seem\nto forget that governance is seen as leadership and leaders are expected to\ninspire. Don’t fall into the trap of assuming that governance is merely about\ndecision making. There is no reason why you can’t constrict it in this way,\nbut you will be missing out on a wealth of opportunities to excite and\nenergize your community.\n\nYou can see the divergence in this approach in conventional government.\nCompare and contrast how some presidential figures have approached\ninspiration. A recent example of an inspirational orator is Barack Obama.\nRegardless of where you stand on his politics, Obama has inspired a\nsignificant chunk of the electorate behind a rhetoric of pumped-up, energized,\nforward-looking narrative, and the promise of a bright future. I am sure you\ncan think of many presidents who merely took office and started legislating.\n\nObama primarily inspired people with the promise of a brighter future, and you\nshould do the same for your own community. However, there is another important\nand more focused responsibility that your governance bodies should shoot for:\ninspiring your members based on the values of your communities.\n\nGovernance is almost entirely based around values. When a government appears\nopen, transparent, and honest, it generates trust, respect, and faith in its\nleaders. When a government throws values out of the window and replaces them\nwith self-interest and sleaze, your community may as well pack up its bags and\ngo home.\n\nYou need to not only understand your values, but celebrate them. It is these\nvalues that will continue to make your community feel open and engaging. When\nyou learn to inspire based on values and the promise of the future, it will\nstand you in good stead and stand your community in even better stead.\n\nLet’s ensure that we make a note of this important topic on our TODO list.\n\norm:swap-title: Governance TODO List\n\n  * Ensure that your community is governed in terms of General Governance, Direction, and (if applicable) Specialist Governance.\n\n  * Build communication channels between the governance body and those whom they govern.\n\n  * Foster a culture in which the members of the community can engage in conversation, debate, and discussion with their governing bodies.\n\n  * Seek to inspire, motivate, and enthuse your community based on future opportunities and the honesty and openness of your governance.\n\n## To Bring Peace\n\nA final topic that is an essential function of governance is the ability to\nbring peace to your community. We all look to our leaders to resolve and calm\nconflict, and your community will be no different.\n\nEvery community faces conflict. Communities attract different personalities,\ngoals, approaches, attitudes, ambitions, and opinions, and some of them are\ngoing to rub us the wrong way. In the worst of these situations, conflict can\ncause deadlocks, and the community will look to its governors to unblock it.\nWe need to expect conflict, acknowledge it, and react to it elegantly.\n\nConflict resolution is a large and complex topic, and with this in mind I have\ndevoted [Chapter 11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and\nRelationships\") to it. As such, we will revisit this topic in that chapter.\nFor now, you should simply ensure that inside the box in your mind that says\n“Governance” is a smaller box with “Conflict Resolution” written on the front.\nLet’s also add it to our TODO list.\n\norm:swap-title: Governance TODO List\n\n  * Ensure that your community is governed in terms of General Governance, Direction, and (if applicable) Specialist Governance.\n\n  * Build communication channels between the governance body and those whom they govern.\n\n  * Foster a culture in which the members of the community can engage in conversation, debate, and discussion with their governing bodies.\n\n  * Seek to inspire, motivate, and enthuse your community based on future opportunities and the honesty and openness of your governance.\n\n  * Provide a clear, objective, and mature approach to solving conflict and contentious issues and for providing a decision when faced with deadlocks.\n\n# Learning from the Leaders\n\nWith a firm understanding of the needs and aspiration behind governance, let’s\nnow take a few minutes to look at some of the approaches to governance that\nsome communities have taken.\n\nOf course, there are thousands of communities around the world, with varying\ngovernance approaches. Fortunately, there are patterns in the chaos, and there\nare three prevalent themes in many communities. These are:\n\nDictatorial charismatic leadership\n\n    \n\nGovernance and decision making that is largely driven and controlled by a\nsingle person\n\nEnlightened dictatorship\n\n    \n\nGovernance that effectively has no formal leader but in which leadership is\ndetermined by reputation in the community\n\nDelegated governance\n\n    \n\nGovernance that is delegated to a series of smaller units that all fit\ntogether to form a single governing body\n\nLet’s take a quick spin through these different themes and see how they apply\nto our communities. This can provide us with an idea of how we want to\nstructure our own governance.\n\n## Dictatorial Charismatic Leadership\n\nPeople hate the word _dictator_. It typically gets something of a bad\nreputation in polite conversation. Unfortunately, history has taught us that\nmany of the most famous “dictators” were mass-murdering psychopaths who\nfoisted their attitudes onto their people. I am sure this is why some of you\nmay have been a little surprised to read that there is a type of acceptable\ngovernance that is driven by dictators. Fortunately, mass murder is not a\ncommon practice in these communities. Dictator-led communities work just like\nthey say on the tin: they are communities in which a single person calls the\nshots. This person will often set direction and focus, approve what is\nacceptable in the community, and in technical communities will be the arbiter\nof what gets included in the project. If you still can’t stomach the word\n_dictator_ , substitute _charismatic leader_ in your mind each time I use it.\n\nNow, I know what you are thinking: this doesn’t sound very community-spirited.\nA community in which one person acts as the funnel through which everyone else\nmust flow? Surely that can’t actually work! You would be surprised.\n\nThere are many dictator-led communities that are popular and attract large\nnumbers of people. Two very prominent technical examples of this are Linux and\nPython. Within these communities exist two highly visible leaders: Linus\nTorvalds and Guido van Rossum, respectively. Linus and Guido are the people\nwho have traditionally decided on direction, set focus, and accepted or\nrejected contributions.\n\nIn the Free Software world, one of the most notable cases of dictatorship was\nthe choice of the third version of the GNU General Public License, perhaps the\nsoftware license in most widespread use by Free Software projects (including\nLinux). Years of discussion went into this license, including intense meetings\nand negotiations with representatives of companies and software projects of\nall sizes. Yet in the end, someone had to make a decision, and that person was\nthe illustrious president of the Free Software Foundation, Richard Stallman.\n\nAlthough the dictators in these communities are typically the original\nfounders of the community, this does not mean they don’t lean on the community\nfor help and support in judging contributions to the project. Typically these\nleaders will handpick trusted and reliable members to lend a hand. In these\ncommunities there is often no open governance, no elections, and no community-\ndiscussed focus and direction.\n\nDespite these communities’ restrictive nature, time and time again\ncontributors join up and enjoy their involvement. Despite this, however, I\nrecommend against a dictator-led community, for a few reasons:\n\nLack of transparency\n\n    \n\nEarlier I went into detail about why openness and transparency are important\nin volunteer communities. Dictatorial communities are something of an\nantithesis to this approach, and their leaders always face the risk of not\nrepresenting the views of the wider community.\n\nBus factor\n\n    \n\nCommunities that have a single, strongly focused leader face considerable risk\nif that leader gets hit by a bus. Other, more openly governed communities are\noften able to transition to other leaders more efficiently.\n\nDirection\n\n    \n\nCommunities with a single leader who decides what direction the community\ntakes can have difficulty expanding their focus. As an example, if your\ncommunity is building a website, the leader may stick with outdated ideas of\nhow it should be structured and behave after the rest of the world has moved\nto new technologies and architectures. There is a very real risk of “It’s my\nball and we are playing my game” with this approach.\n\nOf course, if you are the founder of your community, only you can decide\nwhether the dictatorial approach is suitable. In almost all scenarios I\nrecommend against it, and if you are keen to have a strong level of control,\nat least delegate some control to councils (as we will discuss in the section\n[Delegated Governance](ch10.html#delegated_governance \"Delegated\nGovernance\")).\n\nTechnical communities who have successfully implemented the dictatorial model\noften refer to their primary leader as a _benevolent dictator_. This term is\ninspired by historical leaders such as Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of\nSerbia; Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia; and Frederick II of\nPrussia, King of Germany, who led and governed their people as dictators but\napplied rationality to their approaches.\n\nIn historical terms, this rationality was manifested as religious toleration,\nfreedom of speech and the press, and the right to hold private property. In\nthe technical space, benevolent dictators apply the same sense of rationality\nto toleration, and freedom of speech and press, but also often inspire open\ncontributions, delegated responsibilities, and more.\n\n## Enlightened Dictatorship\n\nIn contrast to dictatorship and benevolent dictators, a popular form of\ncommunity that has grown in both online and offline communities is\n_enlightened dictatorship_. With this approach the concept is simple: there is\nessentially no leader.\n\nConfused? Don’t be.\n\nNot all collaborative communities need leaders; they just need a general ad\nhoc agreement of what is not acceptable. When your community knows what is\n“not cool,” it means all other contributions are, by definition, “cool.”\n\nWhile this may sound like an environment driven by chaos and mismatched focus,\nmany communities have been productive with this approach. Although there is no\nformal leader, the sense of leadership naturally grows out of reputations that\nare developed and matured within the community.\n\nAt its heart, this is a pure form of meritocracy: when people do great work,\nthey become thought leaders. Although some communities may enable people to\nclimb the ladder based on meritocracy, in an enlightened dictatorship there\nsimply is no ladder.\n\nAn interesting example of this approach is the KDE project. Founded by\nMatthias Ettrich, KDE set out to build an easy-to-use desktop environment, and\nit has become popular among Linux and other Free Software enthusiasts.\n\nI was one such enthusiast. Back in 2001 I joined the project, attracted not\nonly by its purpose and direction, but also by the apparent openness in the\ncommunity. To participate back then involved learning a fairly stiff set of\nprogramming tools that was commanded by the Aladdin’s Cave of complexity that\nis the C++ programming language.\n\nMy C++ skills were, frankly, pants. I tried my best to learn. I bought books,\nread websites, took courses, and even watched tuition videos hosted by a man\nwith a kipper tie. Despite my bumbling attempts at C++, one magical\nopportunity existed: I knew that if I could gain those skills, I was welcome\nin that community. Of course, these days a more diverse menu of opportunities\nis available for those who want to participate in KDE, but even in the dark\nage of when I was involved, openness was always present.\n\nAlthough KDE has hundreds of contributors from around the word, there is no\nformalized leader that exists beyond the limited set of developers who look\nafter the different chunks of code (called modules) and the release manager.\nIt is the many developers involved in KDE who are the arbiters of which bugs\nget fixed and what features are added. This makes for an interesting dynamic\nwhen interacting within the group and how the group is perceived by the\noutside community. This dynamic has created something of a mantra of “those\nwho code get their way,” a position that some cherish as a pure approach to\nopen source community and some believe makes a community less approachable.\nWhichever position you take, the KDE project has made great strides in\nproductivity.\n\nOne of the most evident places this mantra is exercised is within the KHTML\nportion of the project, which produces technology for displaying web pages. As\nWebKit (an alternative technology originally based on KHTML) has gained\ntraction within the embedded and desktop markets, many people from outside the\ncommunity have questioned why KHTML is still maintained at all and not been\nabandoned in favor of WebKit.\n\nAs Ian Reinhart Geiser, a longtime KDE contributor and member of the KHTML\nproject, explained to me:\n\n> Technical arguments aside, it is the choice of the maintainers of KHTML to\n> keep maintaining their code base and continuing its life. There is no active\n> movement against WebKit and in fact there is a smaller group of developers\n> who are working on a KDE version of WebKit. The will of the KHTML developers\n> is what decides the technical direction of progress in the KDE project.\n\nIt is the presence of enlightened dictatorship that Geiser arguably believes\nhas enabled the KHTML developers to push forward with their own approaches\nthat they feel happy with. Although it may not make sense to some, it\nexemplifies the freedom in this project for raw technical contributions to\ndefine direction—a freedom that has helped the project maintain its\nflexibility and its momentum.\n\n## Delegated Governance\n\nOur final approach to governance is the one I find most appropriate, open,\ntransparent, and conducive to robust community. In essence, it puts governance\nin the hands of an openly nominated and elected group of people who have\nrespected and recognized expertise.\n\nMany powerful examples of this approach to governance are in place, and it is\nan approach that we have used extensively in the Ubuntu project. We are not\nalone, though; each major Linux distribution takes the same approach,\nincluding Debian, Fedora, and OpenSuSE.\n\nIn delegated governance, the founders of the project nominate a diverse body\nof leaders to represent the best interests of the community. This governing\nbody has a mandate and a set of responsibilities, along with a transparent\nprocedure for electing or otherwise replacing members, and these members are\ntypically chosen for their well-respected contributions to the community.\nAlthough the approach is very open and transparent, it does have one\ndistinctive risk: _complexity_.\n\nBuilding an open yet responsible governance body is not a particularly simple\ntask. You need to know what you want to achieve, how to structure the\ngovernance, what are the requirements of your members, and how to ensure that\nyour community is fully supportive of the authority put in the hands of the\nresultant Community Council.\n\nThat can appear complicated to put in place, and can also seem overly complex\nto your community. As such, we need to work hard not only to craft an\neffective governance body, but also to communicate to the whole community the\nway governance works and get them on board. Again, we can do this. We just\nneed to pay keen attention to detail and ensure that we tick all the right\nboxes.\n\nThe Ugly B-Word: Still Ugly\n\nHere I need to throw out another quick reminder of the importance of avoiding\n_bureaucracy_.\n\nAlways remember that most people view governance as neither cool nor\ninteresting. Our goal is to keep the amount of governance infrastructure and\ndocumentation to an absolute minimum while still maintaining the quality and\nobjectivity that we strive for.\n\n# Setting Up a Community Council\n\nIf you follow my advice and choose delegated governance—or at least some\nelements of it—you need to build a governance body. For many communities this\nmeans forming a _council_. A council is a group of selected members in a\ncommunity who govern collectively. Issues and topics can be presented to this\ncouncil, and they will come to a united opinion that is typically concluded in\na vote. As an example, if the council has seven members, they may allocate 20\nminutes to discussing a proposal and let it go forward if four members support\nit. (In practice, if your council is deciding a lot of issues on the basis of\na bare majority, the community is not well governed and there is likely to be\ndestructive conflict—but we’re just covering the basic principle here.)\n\nMany communities form a _Community Council_ , a single council that governs\nthe entire community. For most communities this is a great solution, but\nlarger communities benefit from delegating some authority from the Community\nCouncil to additional subcouncils. For now, though, we are going to explore\nwhat is involved in setting up a single Community Council to govern your\ncommunity.\n\nCouncils Versus Teams\n\nThis chapter discusses long-term forms of governance, which are basically\ninvested in _councils_ or _boards_. This is different from groups that form\nmore organically and naturally to handle particular objectives or goals in\nyour strategic plan. The less formal groups are usually called _teams_ or\n_committees_. I talked about teams in [Chapter 2](ch02.html\n\"Chapter 2. Planning Your Community\"), and they are certainly the basis for\neffective community work. But teams or committees focus on getting some\nconcrete task done, not on governance, so I don’t cover them in this chapter.\n\nCertainly, a council can form a team to handle a specific task related to\ngovernance, such as writing one of the documents I describe in this chapter or\nnominating members for councils.\n\n## Designing a Council\n\nOur first task is to understand what you want to achieve with your Community\nCouncil and document the full extent of its responsibilities. Governance\nbodies are fundamentally institutions with an authority the community agrees\non, so we need to understand where that authority begins and ends. This\nagreement is also important for your community: they will want to have\nconfidence in what the Community Council can help with, and also will want to\nunderstand what areas are beyond their control. Obviously, the limits are even\nmore important for subcouncils so that they don’t make decisions at cross-\npurposes.\n\nDesigning and documenting your council is important for three reasons:\n\n  * Explicitly discussing the council’s responsibilities will help you as a community leader understand the full rationale behind the council and how it should work.\n\n  * Clear expectations also help all council members know how to handle their responsibilities and will make them more willing to serve.\n\n  * A well-designed and -documented council will protect your community from accusations of corruption. If the remit and extent of the council are well known and the members are known to act within those expectations, accusations of favoritism or misuse of authority will be rare.\n\nThe building blocks of a council are your decisions regarding:\n\n  * Responsibilities\n\n  * Structure\n\n  * Membership\n\n  * Communication\n\nThe next few sections of this chapter look at the choices you have for each of\nthese building blocks, and some of the criteria that help you make your\nchoice. Along the way, I’ll show you how to document your decision—a crucial\naspect of governance. Like anything else you want your members to learn about,\na council requires documentation.\n\nTo make this as simple to understand as possible, it’s easiest to describe an\nexample fictional council. So, friends, for the next few pages we are all\nmembers of an exciting new open source project that has produced a Frequently\nAsked Questions content management system called Tobe (named after “To be or\nnot to be, that is the question”). Actually, trivia fans, this was an old\nproject I worked on many moons ago when I was a web developer, so it seems\nlike an apt choice for an example.\n\n### Note\n\nThe Tobe project is no longer running, so don’t get too excited if you are\nlooking for something similar. I still think a FAQ management system would be\nan incredible resource for many communities, though, so if you produce one, do\nlet me know!\n\nOur fictional Tobe system is a complete web application for maintaining FAQs.\nIt is written using the PHP language and MySQL database. Because it’s\nfictional, let’s say it has an excellent user interface, wonderfully written\ncode, and legions of fans around the world (including Johnny Depp and Nicole\nKidman). As such, Tobe has a large and bustling contributor community, so\nlarge that we are feeling the need for a Community Council to help guide the\nproject forward and ensure that the community is always open and accessible.\n\n### Responsibilities\n\nThe primary purpose of a council is to provide fair governance and feedback on\nan agreed set of responsibilities in the community. What you choose as these\nresponsibilities will vary: it is highly dependent on your community. But your\ncommunity needs to be united in agreement about what these responsibilities\nare. We need the community to be fully aware of what purpose the council\nserves.\n\nChoosing this set of responsibilities may be more complicated than you\nimagine. What we are shooting for here is a council that members need to\nconsult relatively rarely and only when there’s no way around it. What we\ndon’t want to do is to build an environment in which someone can’t scratch her\nleg without consulting the council. If we assign too much responsibility to\nthe council, it will annoy the community and make it feel restrictive, and I\ncan guarantee that the council will also become an impediment to getting\nthings done. For communities, I heartily endorse the old aphorism, “That\ngovernment is best which governs least.”\n\nOn the other hand, we don’t want to provide the council with too little\nresponsibility: it does need to have the power to resolve disputes and set\ndirection firmly when the community needs that guidance. In a nutshell, we\nneed to strike a balance.\n\nThe common responsibilities that you may want to consider for your council\nare:\n\nMembership approval/rejection\n\n    \n\nA council is often a useful body for approving or rejecting members who want\nto join your project. You need to decide what kind of members these should\nbe—general members, developers, other contributors, and so on. We will discuss\nthis in more detail shortly.\n\nConflict resolution\n\n    \n\nMany councils act as an objective third party in dealing with conflict. In\nthis case, members of the community will schedule a conflict discussion with\nthe council, and the council members decide on an appropriate outcome. This\nhas occurred in the Ubuntu community many times, and the Community Council\ntypically has been successful in bringing closure to conflict issues.\n\nProject values\n\n    \n\nMany councils act as an arbiter over the core values of a community. As an\nexample, in the Ubuntu community there is a set of core values around freedom\nthat the project always seeks to maintain. If anyone feels these core values\nshould be adjusted, or if they have not been met, the member is advised to\nraise this with the Community Council. Note that upholding core values is key\nto conflict resolution, but it’s not quite the same thing, because communities\nalso sometimes drift away from their values unintentionally and just need a\nreminder.\n\nCommunity process changes\n\n    \n\nCouncils can drive changes to processes in your community and get those\nchanges accepted. If you have a Community Council that is known to fairly\nrepresent the community and they approve a process change, your community will\nfeel like the process is now considered “official.” As an example, in the\nUbuntu community we changed the process in which developers applied to be a\nmember of the project, and the Community Council needed to approve it. When it\nwas approved, the community unequivocally accepted it.\n\nOrdaining governance bodies\n\n    \n\nIf your community is large and requires multiple governance councils, your\nprimary Community Council should be the body to make a proposed subcouncil\nofficial. As an example, Ubuntu’s Community Council approved and officially\nnominated members for subcouncils such as the Forums Council and IRC Council.\n\nDirection\n\n    \n\nCouncils often determine, or at least weigh in on, the long-term direction of\na project. As an example, if you are a software project, your council may\ndecide on the feature goals for a given release targeting a given release\ndate. This is a controversial topic in governance, and many communities vary\nin whether they allow a governing body to dictate features or their timing. In\nthe Ubuntu community, a separate body called the Technical Board acts as an\narbiter over debates concerning feature direction.\n\nWhile you are considering which responsibilities your council should take on,\nask yourself how much impact these topics are going have on the day-to-day\nwork in your community. As we said earlier, you want to achieve a state in\nwhich your community has to interact with a governing body only on limited\noccasions.\n\nLet’s look at a few examples of what not to do:\n\n  * As I mentioned, leaders may decide to grant councils the right to set feature direction when there’s no need for it. If you have excellent contributors who are not on the council, the right features may simply arise from their work and discussions.\n\n  * The council does not act as a bottleneck to choose people for small, straightforward roles such as mailing list moderator. Making the moderators go before the council to approve a new moderator is a waste of everybody’s time, as long as the moderators are happy with their own decision.\n\n  * The council should not have to approve the formation of a new team. Let people set up their own teams as they see a need. This will result in more teams and more diversity in your project. But the council could set up a special category of _approved teams_ who have additional responsibility and need to be vetted by the council. An example of a useful role for an approved team is the Approved LoCo Teams (local user groups) in the Ubuntu community. While anyone can set up a local Ubuntu LoCo team, those teams who have demonstrated consistent good work can be approved and will have better access to merchandise, content, and resources. This is a useful way to reduce waste of resources because approved LoCo teams are generally a lot more responsible.\n\nAfter deciding on these responsibilities, you should put together a document\nthat outlines each responsibility in detail. This can be the basis for forming\nthe council.\n\nLet’s apply this to our Community Council for the Tobe project example. I\nthink this would be a suitable selection of privileges.\n\nTobe Community Council Responsibilities\n\nThe Tobe Community Council (TCC) will govern the Tobe project by exercising\nthe following responsibilities:\n\n  * Developer Approval—The TCC will judge applications for project developer positions. A prospective developer should present a wiki page that outlines his work in the Tobe project and lists at least two endorsements from current developers. The TCC will vote on the application.\n\n  * Process Changes—Any significant changes to community-wide processes should be approved by the TCC.\n\n  * Governance Changes—Any changes to community governance (including the formation of new governance bodies) should be approved by the TCC.\n\n  * Conflict Resolution—If a member of the community has a conflict with other members that is hampering work and cannot be resolved, this issue can be raised to the TCC. The notice can either be given publicly in a meeting or be privately posted to the TCC mailing list. Any case put before the TCC should have as much externally referenced evidence as possible to demonstrate the conflict.\n\n(You may notice that I have not included “Direction” in these\nresponsibilities. I don’t believe that governed feature direction is necessary\nfor a small community such as Tobe, because it could inhibit innovation.)\n\n### Structure\n\nWith our responsibilities in place, we now need to plan our council’s\nstructure. While a council may seem like fairly straightforward structure—a\ngroup of cooperating members—we need to consider some important details.\n\nThe first decision is how many members should be on the council. For most of\nthe councils I have been involved in, a good number is five to seven. This\nprovides a good range of opinion on topics while building in enough redundancy\nto handle absences (such as when members are on vacation).\n\nBase the number of council members on the number of good candidates you\nactually have available. Don’t pick seven members for the sake of a large size\nif you only have two or three existing contributors who would make suitable\ncouncil members. We will discuss how to assess quality members later in this\nchapter.\n\nThe next decision is whether one of your council members has a tie breaking\nprivilege. If you have a meeting attended by six council members and three\nvote on each side of an issue, you have reached a deadlock that cannot move\nforward. So seriously consider appointing a member with the privilege to cast\na tie breaking vote in a deadlock situation. In the Ubuntu community, Mark\nShuttleworth has this privilege. The Fedora and OpenSuSE Linux distributions\nhave similar roles in place.\n\nIf you decide to include a tie-breaking role, ensure that the person in this\nrole is the very model of objectivity and responsibility. The privilege\nconfers great power, and you must ensure that it is always exerted with the\nbest interests of the community at heart. We will discuss membership\nrequirements in the next section, and your tie breaker should excel in\ndemonstrating the attributes covered in that section.\n\n### Note\n\nOf course, you may consider yourself for this privilege. But before you do,\nlook at yourself in the mirror and ask whether you deserve it. Although by\nreading this book you evidently have the interests of community at heart, can\nyou really offer an entirely objective opinion?\n\nThe next consideration when deciding on the membership structure of the\ncouncil is how long each member serves. There are, of course, varying opinions\non this. Some believe that one year is a suitable term, particularly given the\nfast-changing nature of community. Others believe two years is more\nappropriate because it provides a better sense of stability and focus for the\ncouncil, and it lets your community get used to the same names and\nexpectations. Some people, after serving on councils, say, “It took me a year\nto figure out how the council works.”\n\nI believe that term length is largely dependent on (a) the type of council you\nare building and (b) the maturity of the membership you have available. For\ngeneral Community Councils that oversee process changes, conflicts, and other\nsimilar elements from our list of responsibilities a few pages back, it is\nreasonable to have a two-year term. This has been used in many existing\ncouncils and has worked out well. For technical and direction-focused\ncouncils, I feel a one-year term is often more appropriate. A shorter term\nalways ensures that your council has fresh perspective, and if the current\ncouncil is serving well, simply allow the members to continue their term.\n\nTerm length is related to the decision of whether existing council members can\n(a) serve repeat terms and (b) be on multiple councils simultaneously in your\ncommunity.\n\nI am personally against term limits. If you have excellent governing community\nmembers, you should allow them to continue doing great work. However, you\nshould also have a fair and representative system in place to ensure that your\ncommunity does not develop an “old boys’ club” with ineffective governing\nmembers who may not be especially forward-thinking. In other words, excellence\nshould not be capped by term length, but you should ensure that your community\ncan kick out ineffective members.\n\nAlways Maintain Quality\n\nRemember that if you have problems with an “old boys’ club” nesting in your\ncouncil, your governance structure _can_ be changed to prevent it.\n\nIn some communities, if the selection process for governing members repeatedly\nnets ineffective officers the general feeling can be, “Well, that’s the way\nthe community works and we just have to deal with it.”\n\nDon’t just deal with it. If your community governance is not working, change\nit so that it can work. In doing this, it’s important not to single out and\nexcoriate problematic members. A proposed modification to council nomination\nor election should not be “David Foo is doing a terrible job, so he should be\nbanned from applying to the council in the future.” Instead, you should build\na system that weeds out ineffective members quickly and averts their\nnomination in the first place. You can base the system on experiences with\ncurrent bad council members, but think in general terms.\n\nCriteria for excluding and removing council members could include a required\nlevel of participation, audits of how well the council works, and an agreed\nmanifesto listing what members will work on. Each of these initiatives can\nhelp your community judge whether a member is effective. Finally, institute a\nprocess to review whether members should still be on the council.\n\nOf course, you need to temper these considerations with moderation: you do not\nwant council members to feel like Big Brother is constantly checking in on\nthem.\n\n### Commercial sponsorship\n\nBefore we move on, I want to raise a sensitive consideration when it comes to\nthe structure of your council: commercial investment and sponsorship.\n\nMany communities have commercial sponsors and investors. These sponsors often\nhave a staff of developers and contributors who work within the community to\nmake contributions that benefit the investor. Sometimes the community has a\nsingle sponsor, who perhaps founded the community in the first place.\n\nExamples of this situation include the major Linux distributions: Ubuntu was\nfounded and is mostly funded by Canonical Ltd., Fedora by Red Hat, and\nOpenSuSE by Novell. With such significant investment in these communities,\nwhat impact should these investors have in the governance of the project? At\nwhat point is investment in a community considered a reasonable justification\nfor governance?\n\nLet’s take a look at the impact of these sponsors on the governance of those\nprojects:\n\nUbuntu (sponsored by Canonical Ltd.)\n\n    \n\nOf the seven places in the Ubuntu Community Council, only one seat is\nappointed—that of Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth, who has tie breaking\npower. The other six seats are open to anyone, from Canonical or otherwise.\n\nFedora (sponsored by Red Hat)\n\n    \n\nThe Fedora Board (its Community Council) has a Red Hat-appointed chairperson\nwith tie breaking power and nine seats. Of those nine seats, four are\nappointed to Red Hat staff members and the other five are openly elected. This\nmeans at least half of the board must be working at Red Hat, one of whom has a\ntie breaking vote.\n\nOpenSuSE (sponsored by Novell)\n\n    \n\nThe OpenSuSE Board (its Community Council) has a chairperson who works for\nNovell and who has tie breaking privileges. There are four other seats, two of\nwhich must be occupied by Novell staff members.\n\nAlthough the numbers are different, the Fedora and OpenSuSE approaches produce\nessentially the same effect: a board in which 50% of the seats are reserved\nfor the sponsor, one of whom is the chairperson with a tie breaking vote. This\nmeans that, conceivably, the sponsor could push through any issue they want:\nin OpenSuSE, the Novell staff could vote their majority, while in Fedora,\nthere would be a deadlock of votes down the middle, allowing the chairperson\nto cast the deciding vote.\n\nThe Ubuntu approach is different: Mark Shuttleworth has the only reserved\nseat. Even with his tie-breaking privilege, it would be difficult to push\nsomething through unless it got to a deadlock, and Canonical has no way to\nengineer a deadlock internally, as all other seats are equally available to\nnon-Canonical contributors. In fact, at the time of this writing the majority\nof members on the Community Council don’t work for Canonical.\n\nI believe that for general volunteer communities such as open source projects,\nsponsorship and investment should never buy you a place in a governance body.\nI say this not because these commercial sponsors cannot be trusted, but\nbecause volunteer associative communities are often based on the contributions\nof all members, and these members give of themselves in exchange for the\nassurance that their hard work will go toward their fellow members and the\ncommunity’s future.\n\nLet us now apply some of this thinking to our Tobe example council.\n\nTobe Community Council Structure\n\nThe Tobe Community Council (TCC) will have five membership seats, one of which\nis held by the founder of the project and has a tie breaker privilege.\n\nCommercial sponsorship does not guarantee representation by employees of the\nsponsor on the council.\n\n### Membership\n\nWith a clear idea of your requirements and structure, the next step is to\nfigure out what you are looking for in your council’s members.\n\nA council is nothing more than a collection of dependable people with a set of\nresponsibilities. You need to depend on the members of your council to\ndemonstrate maturity, competence, objectivity, and sensitivity. Good council\nmembers are there not just for their personal contributions and abilities, but\nbecause they can represent the needs of the community.\n\nAfter I gave a keynote on governance at the SoCal Linux Expo in Los Angeles, a\nchap came over and asked me what appeared to be a devilishly simple question:\n\nWhat kind of people should I look for to be on my community’s council?  \n---  \n  \nThis got me thinking. Can we build a recipe for an excellent governing\ncommunity member, and list the ingredients to look out for when choosing these\nmembers?\n\nWell, kind of. In my experience, community members come in many shapes and\nsizes. There is absolutely no commonality in terms of gender, race, career\nchoice, technical experience, or age. You simply can’t look at someone on the\nstreet and determine that she is a great council member. As we discussed\nearlier in the book, these checkboxes of surface-level diversity items will\nnot help you to build a great council. We instead need to look for deep-level\nattributes that point to maturity and capability in governance.\n\nFortunately, there is a common set of traits that you should be looking for.\nThese ingredients will indicate that someone has the chops for governing your\ncommunity:\n\nWilling to listen\n\n    \n\nGreat governors are always willing to listen. You will rely on your council\nmembers to listen to your community and make sensible decisions based on\nhearing the full story. This is particularly important in cases of conflict\nresolution. A useful method of identifying this trait is to listen to a\nprospective council member in a normal conversation and make a mental note of\njust how much he listens as opposed to speaks. See how much he contributes to\nthe discussion, see how often he chips in or interrupts, and see how much he\nqueries the information he hears. This will help you determine whether he is a\ngood listener.\n\nUnbiased and objective\n\n    \n\nYour council members need to ensure that they don’t demonstrate any apparent\nsense of bias. Of course, everyone is biased in one way or another, but you\nneed to shoot for council members who can do their best to put their biases to\none side. A good test of this is if a prospective council member is open to\nchanging her views based on further information. Another good sign is whether\nshe is able to agree on a topic with someone whom she typically disagrees\nwith. Watch her debate, and observe if she adjusts her argument as the debate\nprogresses: this is a great attribute to have in a governing member.\n\nDetail-oriented\n\n    \n\nGreat governors pay serious attention to detail. They understand that the\ndevil is in the details, so they pick up on the hidden details in a discussion\nand ensure that these details get covered. Watch how they communicate to see\nhow they raise and react to details.\n\nReliable\n\n    \n\nOne of the most significant considerations with community-based governance is\nsimply having people show up and fulfill their responsibilities on the\ncouncil. If you have a governing body that has members who should attend\nmeetings, don’t be surprised if some members don’t show up. You need to find\npeople who are willing to put that PlayStation controller down, willing to get\nout of bed early if a meeting is scheduled to cater to another part of the\nworld, and willing to _make time_ for your community. Of course, life happens\nand people cannot always make meetings, but you can assess how reliable your\nprospective members are by seeing how often they attend your community over an\nextended period of time. Don’t assess them for the few months building up to\nnominations for the council, as they may try harder than normal to demonstrate\nreliability. Instead, observe them over a wider period of time without them\nknowing. This will help you get a more objective view on their reliability and\nattendance.\n\nA fair fighter\n\n    \n\nThis is a rare trait. You really want to look out for people who will fight\nfor the right thing, but put the integrity of the council and the community\nabove the outcome of a fight. The ideal person here is relaxed and calm, but\nwhen required, will put his head above water to do the right thing. The only\nway you can assess this is to look at this person's experience since he has\njoined the community and balance the times he stood up for different things,\nwhether it was justified, and how he handled losing an argument.\n\nWith these expectations in mind, you should properly document the expectations\nof council members so that prospective candidates have a clear idea of what is\ninvolved. Let’s apply this to our Tobe example.\n\nTobe Community Council Membership Expectations\n\nEach seat on the Tobe Community Council (TCC) is for a period of two (2) years\nand has the following expectations:\n\n  * Engagement—Each member of the TCC is expected to engage with the community politely and fairly and to refrain from using bad language, offensive statements, or insulting comments.\n\n  * Fairness—Each member of the TCC is expected to consider each case brought to it; listen to all the evidence and perspectives from the people involved; and pass a fair, unbiased, and objective decision based on the evidence provided, the goals of the Tobe project, and the best interests of the community.\n\n  * Reliability—The TCC has a defined set of required meetings and responsibilities. Each member is expected to be responsive and receptive to these responsibilities. Each member is also expected to notify the TCC concerning any prolonged periods of absence. If a member of the TCC cannot fulfill his or her responsibilities, lacks the time to participate effectively, or otherwise cannot tend to the requirements of the TCC, he or she is expected to step down gracefully. It is also preferable but not required that the member who has stepped down help his or her replacement transition into the role easily.\n\nThis rather juicy statement combined with the _Responsibilities_ and\n_Structure_ statements earlier provide a comprehensive set of expectations\naround the role of a governing member and its scope.\n\nBefore we move on, I want to share a few thoughts about your own expectations.\nIf this is your first time working to set up a governance body, it can often\nbe difficult to figure out which people have the right requirements. If you\nare anything like I was when I first did this, you will be terrified that you\nhave missed an important piece of fine print when documenting the council, and\nthat you are going to unwittingly recruit a destructive idiot.\n\nFirst, don’t worry. This is your first time. Everyone makes mistakes, and you\nare going to as well. The best medicine for avoiding mistakes is experience,\nand I would highly recommend you find someone who has worked on governance\nbefore and ask that person to take a look at your work and pass comment. Take\na quick look online at some of the existing governance bodies in communities\nthat you follow, see who was involved in setting them up, and drop him an\nemail to see whether he would be willing to offer some advice and thoughts.\n\n### Note\n\nOf course, by saying this I know I am about to get deluged in email! I am\ncertainly willing to help, but when the deluge occurs, I might not be able to\nhelp all of you, so don’t be offended if I don’t have time.\n\nIn this section we have focused our efforts primarily on the attributes that\nwe are looking for in our council members, but not how we actually elect them.\nWe will discuss this a little later.\n\n### Communication\n\nWith a design in place that has firm responsibilities, structure, and\nmembership expectations, we now need to decide how our council members will\ncommunicate with one another. Here we need to decide (a) which resources they\nwill use to communicate and (b) the requirements we make on their time for\nactivities such as meetings.\n\nLet’s start with resources. You first need to ensure that you have a primary\ncommunication channel in place. Earlier in this book we discussed some of the\nresources that are available, so we won’t cover that ground again; instead,\nlet's look at a suitable approach that many communities have used: a single\nmailing list and online chat channel.\n\nA mailing list is an excellent method of having general discussion inside the\ncouncil. It is simple and low-bandwidth, and you can ensure that people’s\naccess to it is restricted to their term on the council. Mailing lists are\nalso useful for documenting discussion that may need to be revisited later.\n\nI highly recommend setting up a mailing list, whatever your community. Before\nyou rush out and do this, though, you need to make a few important decisions\nabout its use:\n\nFocus\n\n    \n\nMailing lists are excellent for general discussion. Although they can also be\nused for voting on an issue, I instead recommend real-time discussion such as\na phone call or IRC channel for that. Many communities have found that voting\non mailing lists can take weeks to finalize. With real-time discussion, the\nvoting is much quicker.\n\nMembership\n\n    \n\nProvide access to your mailing list only to members of the council. Make it\nclear that when they leave the council or their membership expires, their\nsubscriptions to the mailing list will also expire.\n\nPrivacy\n\n    \n\nMailing list software packages provide the option to have public archives of\nthe discussion. I strongly recommend that you have private, nonpublic\narchives. While this may surprise you, I recommend this because when public\narchives are available, your members will not be as blunt or honest in their\nfeedback. When your council deals with a conflict issue or a membership\nrequest, you rely on honest opinions from your members about the individual(s)\nconcerned. This can be tricky if the mailing list is public and a council\nmember wants to share some critical views of that person with the rest of the\nmembers. If the list archives are private, you will get a better quality of\nfeedback from your members.\n\nOn the other hand, some organizations require open meetings by law. In this\ncase, provide two mailing lists: a public one for most community issues and a\nprivate one for personnel issues, which includes the conflict and membership\nsituations just mentioned. This is comparable to physical meetings where\ncouncils ask visitors to leave, and go into “executive session” for personnel\nissues.\n\nThe problem with a mailing list (particularly one with limited membership and\nclosed archives) is that it lacks the transparency and access that your\ncommunity will rightfully expect. So I highly recommend that you augment your\nmailing list with regular real-time meetings, preferably using IRC or possibly\neven an open conference call on the phone. These meetings should be publicized\nas an opportunity for your community to raise topics with the council.\n\nThe choice between IRC and the phone depends on the habits of your community\nmembers. From a pure features perspective, IRC is better: it is cheaper,\neasier to log, and accommodates more simultaneous participants than the phone.\nThe problem with IRC is that only technical communities tend to know much\nabout it. If your community has no idea what IRC is, getting them to use it is\nakin to trying to make a cat bark. As such, the phone could be a better bet.\n\n### Note\n\nOf course, if your community is small and local, there is no reason that\nmeetings can’t occur face-to-face in a local coffee shop or somewhere similar.\nLook at your community and make a decision based on the norms of how it\ncommunicates.\n\nWhatever you decide, you should have regular meetings for your council. The\npurpose of these meetings is to provide an opportunity for your community to\nengage with the body that governs it. As such, you should make it explicitly\nclear to your council members that they should attend every meeting.\n\nA final note on communication is to make sure your community can add items to\nthe council meeting agenda in a simple and organized way. Your community needs\nto feel that they can raise topics on the council. I recommend having a public\nagenda visible so that (a) people can add items to it and (b) others can see\nwhat items are planned for discussion and join in if it interests them.\n\nA useful way to do this is to set up a wiki and simply ask people to update\nthe agenda page when they want to discuss a topic.\n\nLet’s now put a policy regarding communications in place for our Tobe\nCommunity Council.\n\nTobe Community Council Communications\n\nThe Tobe Community Council (TCC) has two primary resources for internal\ncommunication and interaction with the community:\n\n  * tobe-community-council Mailing List—This mailing list, which is by invitation only, is available to all council members but to no one else. Council members are removed from the list when their role on the council ends. It can be used to raise any issue in private within the TCC. Discussions occur only among TCC members and are not archived or shared elsewhere.\n\n  * #tobe-meeting—On the first Tuesday of every month at 18:00 UTC, the TCC has a public meeting that the full community is welcome to attend. The agenda, available at _http://www.exampleproject.org/tobe/wiki/MeetingAgenda_ , will be discussed in each meeting. If you want to add an agenda item to the meeting, update that page and ensure that you attend. All meetings are logged and available at _http://www.exampleproject.org/tobe/meetinglogs_.\n\n## Codifying Your Council\n\nWe are now a-rocking and a-rolling with a good idea of how our council is\ngoing to look. Throughout our discussion we have documented our decisions for\nour Tobe example, and you should do the same for your own community. You can\nthen gather these notes together and combine them all into the same document.\nThis process is known as _codifying_ the council.\n\nWhen you have this document together, make it publicly visible. You can then\nuse it as a starting point to gather feedback from your community about the\nproposed council. Notify your community and provide a simple way for them to\nprovide feedback (such as updating a wiki page).\n\nThis feedback provides an excellent opportunity to clarify any elements that\nare vague or incomplete in the document. It will also help you to engage with\nthe community to ensure that the governance structure is really supported and\nreflective of the needs of the wider community. If you develop a Community\nCouncil plan in secret and in closed quarters, you will find it incredibly\ndifficult to push it through, and rightfully so. This proposed governance body\nis a social contract about how your community is run, and the community must\nnot only agree to it but also feel as contented about it as they do about that\nlovely old pair of comfortable shoes that we all have.\n\nTo help illustrate council codification, I’ll present the codification\ndocument we used when forming the Ubuntu Forums Council. This was a council\nthat was put in place in 2006 to help govern the hugely popular Ubuntu Forums.\nOur codification document received extensive review and refinements, and when\nmost people were happy with it, it was approved by the Ubuntu Community\nCouncil and put in place. Here it is.\n\nForums Community Governance Codification\n\nThe forums represent many people’s first meeting with Ubuntu and are an\nimportant resource for support and social interactions and have become one of\nthe most important subprojects within Ubuntu. They are the single largest\nGNU/Linux support forums and one of the most important venues for community\nsupport and interaction. Started independently by Ryan Troy two years ago,\ntheir rapid success was officially recognized when they were designated as the\nOfficial Ubuntu Forums.\n\nThis document aims to:\n\n  * Increase recognition of contributions in the forums with membership, which is ultimately used to approve Community Council members.\n\n  * Provide a clear delegation and codifications of the existing leadership in the forums and plan for handling these decisions in the future.\n\n  * Describe clear democratic and meritocratic processes for the appointment of leadership and staff positions in the forums.\n\n  * Remove several “single points of failure.”\n\n  * Describe methods for both preventing and resolving any future inter-administrator or inter-staff conflicts within the forums.\n\n  * Recognize the hard work of the forums staff through recognition as an integral and _integrated_ part of the forums community.\n\n  * Provide a straightforward process for top forums contributors to be recognized as full members in Ubuntu, with the right to vote on resolutions posed by the Community Council.\n\n  * Provide for a reporting process so that news, ideas and work done in the project by forums users will be communicated to the broader community and appropriately recognized.\n\n**Changes to Current Ubuntu Policy**\n\nThe proposal includes both new policy and the codification of a few existing\nUbuntu policies. These should be discussed with the Community Council and the\nforum staff. After it has been approved by the Community Council we will add\nit to the [community governance\npage](http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/governance) in the Ubuntu\nwebsite.\n\nNote that the document is structured to describe NOT JUST the forums, but\ninstead all the areas of the project which are large and independent enough to\nhave their own dedicated leadership structures.\n\n**Team Councils**\n\nFor active teams and subprojects with Ubuntu, the Ubuntu Community council\ndelegates many of its responsibilities to “Team Councils.” These councils act\nas proxies for the Community Council over a particular team or scope of\nactivity within the Ubuntu community. These governance councils are ultimately\nresponsible for the actions and activity within their team or scope and to\nresolve disputes and manage policies and procedures internal to their team and\nfrequently appoint Ubuntu members on behalf of the Community Council.\n\nThe Ubuntu Forums Council (FC) is the team governance council for the official\nUbuntu forums.\n\n**Forums Council Charter**\n\nThe Forums Council is the group that is ultimately responsible for the\ngoverning of the forums and interfacing between the forums and the rest of the\nUbuntu community and governance systems. It will:\n\n  * Consist of five (5) members. Membership should be public and published.\n\n  * Decisions will be made by a majority of voting Forums Council members when at least three and more than half of the total members have voted.\n\n  * FC members should be accessible by and responsive to the forums community (i.e., through a dedicated forum).\n\n  * Hold “meetings” regularly and visibly. Meetings can either be in IRC in the “ubuntu-meeting” channel or in a special, publicly visible area or subforum.\n\n  * Be appointed by the Ubuntu Community Council in consultation with the Forums Council, forums staff, and active contributors to the forums. Nominations would be open and public and would be considered and evaluated by the CC. Each candidate should prepare a wiki page summarizing their nomination and their contributions and including and referencing testimonials (e.g., something similar to what is prepared for Ubuntu membership). The CC commits to evaluating all nominations on the following criteria, listed in order of importance:\n\n    * The nominees[’] (_essential_) active status as an Ubuntu member.\n\n    * The nominees[’] support from _at least_ one active forum staff member (essential).\n\n    * Opinions and testimonials (positive and negative) from current members of the Forums Council;\n\n    * Opinions and testimonials from current forums staff;\n\n    * Opinions and testimonials from Ubuntu Members, Ubunteros, and other active participants in the forums;\n\n    * Clear evidence of activity within the forums (quality, quantity and duration);\n\n  * Serve terms of two (2) years. FC members could serve multiple or repeated terms. Weight will be given to proved contributors and reelection of consistently active members should be both easy and common.\n\n  * Be formed, initially, of the current forums administrators (i.e., Ryan Troy [Ubuntu-Geek], John Dong [jdong], and Mike Braniff [KiwiNZ]).\n\n  * Have a chairman with a casting vote, appointed by the Community Council, initially to be Ryan Troy.\n\nThe FC would have a number of rights and responsibilities, and be ultimately\nresponsible for the smooth operation of the forums. These include:\n\n  * Appointing or recalling administrators, moderators and forums staff or determining criteria by which they are appointed.\n\n  * Resolving disputes between forums staff and moderators as per the existing dispute resolution system and forums guidelines.\n\n  * With advice, feedback, and help from the forums staff, maintaining and enforcing the Forums Guidelines and associated infrastructure (e.g., the resolution center).\n\n  * Regularly and when possible (i.e., monthly), sending reports or representatives to CC members to weigh in on issues of membership and to update the council on the FC business.\n\n**Staff and Ubuntu Membership**\n\nForums staff will be appointed by the Forums Council. Forums staff are\nexpected to uphold and set an example that is consistent with the Code of\nConduct.\n\nForums staff and participants have the option to become Ubuntu members.\nCurrent staff can apply for membership at an Ubuntu CC meeting. Their\ncontributions as staff members and contributors on the forums should provide\nmore than sufficient evidence of a sustained and significant contribution to\nthe Ubuntu community.\n\n**Dispute Resolution**\n\nThe FC will be responsible for maintaining forum guidelines and systems for\ninternal conflict resolution (e.g., the forums resolution center).\n\nAdditionally, they should provide a documented method whereby any\ndisagreements or conflicts _between_ moderators can request a hearing by the\nFC.\n\nIn extreme situations, users and moderators who feel that they have not been\ngiven a fair hearing by the FC can appeal a decision to the CC. The CC\nconsiders the FC to be a greater authority on forums matters and in the\nmajority of these cases, the CC will likely refer these issues back to the FC.\n\nAny deadlock within the FC will can be referred to the Community Council for\nresolution.\n\nThe Ubuntu Forums Council has been hugely successful, and the expectations\naround its governance have never been questioned. The document helped keep\neveryone on the same page.\n\n## Nominating and Electing Council Members\n\nWith a firm foundation of how your Community Council will work and one that\nhas been publicly documented and approved by the community, the next step is\nto populate the council with members. Earlier we discussed the attributes we\nare looking for in members (willing to listen, unbiased, objective,\nresponsive, attentive to detail, etc.), but now let’s talk about how we can\nfind and motivate these people.\n\n### Forming a new council\n\nWhen forming a new council, especially the first council in your community,\nyou typically need to grandfather people in. In other words, the first set of\nmembers who govern the council are a handpicked group who you are confident\nwill get the council up and running under the agreement you just codified.\n\nAll of your community members need to feel that they have the opportunity to\nbe on the council, but you also want to ensure that you maintain a high level\nof quality among your council members. A common solution to this problem is to\nhave an election in which your community can vote for those who govern them.\n\nUnfortunately, the big misconception in community elections is that elections\nalone will sort the wheat from the chaff. In other words, many believe that if\nyou have an open election, the community will settle on the highest-quality\ncandidates for the council. This is often not the case.\n\nPopularity contests do not form great governance bodies. Someone without the\nmaturity and vision you need may have a lot of friends and influence and snag\na place on the council. On the other hand, there may be a quiet and\nconscientious community member who is perfect for a position in the council\nbut never gets noticed. In fact, the most qualified community members hardly\never put themselves forward for a governing council, because they are too\nwrapped up in doing their work for the community. Fortunately, governments\nfound long ago an effective compromise between pure representative elections\nand top-down selection: a nomination process.\n\nPull together the members you know well, who you feel are the current de facto\nleaders of the community, and hold a meeting to nominate the appropriate\npeople for a position on the council. The people who can participate in this\ndiscussion could be a founder, highly visible contributors, an existing\ncouncil, or others with experience and insight into the community that you\ntrust. This group should nominate a good range of people, and preferably more\npeople than you have places for on the council. As an example, if you have\nfive seats on the council, try to come up with seven or eight nominations.\nEach person should be an excellent candidate who satisfies the criteria we\ndiscussed earlier.\n\nOf course, you should always ensure that before potential members are publicly\nnominated, you contact them to determine whether they actually want to be on\nthe council. Many people want to have nothing to do with governance. As you\ntalk up your goals, some will come around to realize that serving on the\ncouncil complements their current ways of contributing and flexes their\ntalents, but others really have no stomach for meetings or rule making, and\nshould not be browbeaten into serving.\n\nAssume that you’ll be rejected the first time you approach each potential\ncandidate. It’s almost a given. After all:\n\n  * Most people are naturally modest and do not want to claim an honor. Even heroes who rescue people from burning buildings always give speeches afterward saying, “I’m not a hero.”\n\n  * The people you want are busy and happy contributing to the community. They’re afraid that joining the council will take time away from their regular contributions (and they’re usually right), and they’re also afraid that governance is relatively dull.\n\n  * Most people have never served on a board or council and don’t know what it entails. They assume they don’t have the competence to do so.\n\n  * All kinds of cruft around the image most people have of governments and leaders get in the way of their seeing the good things councils can do.\n\nAnticipate all these reactions. They are legitimate, but you have\ncounterarguments to offer. Try to meet in person with a candidate to listen to\nher views and have a candid exchange. If a face-to-face meeting is not\npossible, try to use speak via telephone. The general points you can make are:\n\n  * Your community has reached a point where the lack of governance (or in the case where a council is creating subcouncils, the relative lack of attention to one area) is preventing the members from doing what they want. The potential candidate is furthering her personal goals as well as the goals of the community by taking on the new tasks of governance.\n\n  * Power is not a bad thing. Whatever goals the contributor has, she can push them forward on a much greater scale by representing her needs on the council and making sure the community provides the resources for these tasks.\n\n  * Nobody is putting on a jacket with medals and ribbons; serving on a council is not equivalent to becoming a generalissimo. Other members of the community will still view the council members as ordinary folks whom they can complain to and have a beer with.\n\n  * Some of the greatest life lessons come from serving on governing bodies. Those who do it say afterward that they learned an immense amount about people, organizations, and the essential ways in which the wheels of life turn in terms of timing, finance, and so forth.\n\n  * A council term is limited, and before she knows it, she will be back in the rank and file doing the work she originally loved—but this time with a far deeper understanding of this work and how to make it successful.\n\n  * Everybody feels the same way at first. The very qualities that make them feel inadequate are precisely the ones that will make them good council members.\n\nMost candidates, once you sincerely hear their viewpoints and offer your own,\nwill come around and agree to serve. But as I mentioned, some are truly ill-\nsuited to council work. If they remain convinced that they’ll be bored,\nfrustrated, or unproductive on your council, don’t pressure them—just express\nappreciation for the work they’re already doing. You can probably find a team\nhandling some task that they’d like to work on, and over time they may work\nthemselves through the community structure into a governance position.\n\nNext, ask candidates to produce pages that act as a platform for their\ncandidacy. This page should essentially persuade anyone reading it that he is\nperfect for the role. To make this as simple as possible, you should provide\ncandidates with a template that they can fill out with their information. Here\nis a suggested template:\n\nCandidacy Document for <name>  \n---  \nDate: <date>  \nINTRODUCTION  \n<some introductory text explaining who they are, summarizing their experience\nand what they can bring to the council>  \nCOMMUNITY EXPERIENCE  \nItem of experience.  \nItem of experience.  \nTESTIMONIALS  \n<here other members can add their support for the candidate>  \n<name> <email> <reason for support for a position on the council>  \nGOALS  \n<what they’d like to accomplish in their council role>  \n  \nEach candidacy template should be made available online in the same place so\nthat your community members can review it. A wiki is a great solution.\n\nYou can then open up a vote. How you conduct this vote depends largely on how\nyour community is structured. As an example, if you have the concept of\nmembership, such as approved members or approved developers, it is recommended\nthat you allow only those approved contributors to vote. This will give all\nlegitimate members of the community a voice, while ensuring that the decision\nis made by those who actually know the community well enough to offer an\ninformed opinion.\n\nIf your community is more loosely formed and just consists of anyone who joins\na forum or mailing list, it is more suitable to nominate members from core\ncontributors in the community.\n\n# Ubuntu Governance Example\n\nSo far in this chapter we have discussed the requirements for governance,\ncreated a Community Council, explored the requirements for council members,\nand chosen the council’s members.\n\nAs we said way back in [Chapter 1](ch01.html \"Chapter 1. The Art of\nCommunity\"), stories are the vessels of great best practices, and with\ngovernance such an important part of community growth, I want to devote a good\nchunk of this chapter to an example of an open, transparent, and effective\ncommunity that I have been involved in putting together: the Ubuntu community.\nThis case study will give you a firm idea of how one large community has\napproached it, and the lessons learned.\n\n## In the Beginning...\n\nIn 2004, Mark Shuttleworth, a South African entrepreneur, founded the Ubuntu\nproject. A longtime user, fan, and contributor to free software, he built his\ndigital certificate company, Thawte, on a Free Software foundation. When he\nsold his company to VeriSign, he made what can only be described as a “rather\nlarge bucket of money.”\n\nAfter spending a year in Russia training for a quick trip into space as the\nfirst South African space tourist, Mark started laying plans for a new Linux\ndistribution. At the time, distributions were nothing new: Red Hat, Mandrake,\nDebian, and others were already producing comprehensive operating systems that\ntechnical types such as myself were not only using, but were also trying to\nconvince our reluctant friends and family to use.\n\nMark’s vision was different. First, he wanted to build Ubuntu on the excellent\nfoundation of the existing Debian distribution. To do this he hired some of\nthe cream of the crop in the Debian community, and they set to work to build a\npowerful and easy-to-use operating system. His vision did not end there,\nthough. Mark not only wanted to promote an open source operating system, he\nalso wanted to have the operating system be openly governed. Mark knew the\nimportance of community, and he knew the importance of transparency in a\ncommunity.\n\nAt the time, Linux distributions were going through something of an evolution.\nLinux was beginning to enjoy real commercial interest from the widespread IT\nindustry, and some of the traditional Linux distributors, such as Red Hat and\nSuSE, were seeing serious adoption. Unfortunately, with all of these business\ninterests, power lunches, and monetization, there was a general feeling (at\nleast as I remember it) that community was getting a little lost in the mix.\n\nThis was not exactly surprising. The traditional IT industry was built on an\nunderstanding that programmers are hired to build your software, and that\nproduct managers make the decisions required to direct those programmers and\ndeliver your product.\n\nLinux and open source were different: these companies had to understand that\nvolunteers in bedrooms, basements, and universities had as much input in the\ndirection and focus of that software as anyone else.\n\nWe now know that if these community members are welcomed and treated in a\ncollaborative manner, a company can net a huge amount of unpaid development.\nThe buzzwords _crowdsourcing_ and _peer production_ are widespread in the\nbusiness world. Unfortunately, many of the companies jumping on the open\nsource bandwagon back in 2004 failed to understand and embrace this community.\nInstead, they merely _tolerated_ it as a politically correct nod to the wider\nopen source community.\n\nUbuntu was different. Unlike other companies that wanted to keep governance\ncontrol of the community in their own hands, Mark wanted Ubuntu to be a _pure_\ncommunity. He was keen that there should be a community governing body and\nthat everyone should be able to join that body based on hard work and\ncommitment to the community.\n\nIt is this open community governance that attracted me to Canonical and made\nme want to become the Ubuntu community manager. I was attracted by the premise\nof a Linux distribution that combined a real, open, community governance\ninfrastructure with the commercial support and funding of a company. If we\ncould strike this balance, the world would be our oyster.\n\n## The Structure of the Ubuntu Community\n\nLike many open source communities, the Ubuntu project is _not_ a democracy,\nbut a meritocracy. Contributors are judged in the Ubuntu community on the\nbasis of a _significant and sustained contribution_. It is this simple rule of\nthumb that determines who takes a place in our community as well as our\ngovernance positions.\n\nToday, the Ubuntu community is broken into three approximate layers of\ngovernance, shown in [Figure\n10-1](ch10.html#the_governance_structure_of_the_ubuntu_c \"Figure 10-1. The\nUbuntu community has a number of different groups that govern it, all driven\nby community members.\").\n\n![The Ubuntu community has a number of different groups that govern it, all\ndriven by community\nmembers.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159265.png)\n\nFigure 10-1. The Ubuntu community has a number of different groups that govern\nit, all driven by community members.\n\nThe community has been divided into four primary governing areas:\n\nMark Shuttleworth\n\n    \n\nAs the founder and primary sponsor of Ubuntu, Mark is afforded the privilege\nof a tie breaking vote and of deciding what his employees at Canonical focus\ntheir work on. Although “Mark Shuttleworth” appears at the top of [Figure\n10-1](ch10.html#the_governance_structure_of_the_ubuntu_c \"Figure 10-1. The\nUbuntu community has a number of different groups that govern it, all driven\nby community members.\"), the Community Council and Technical Board do not\nreport to him; this is purely to illustrate his tie-breaking privilege.\n\nCommunity Council\n\n    \n\nThis is the highest governing council in the community. It makes decisions\nabout how the community is run, changes to processes, and other community-wide\nissues.\n\nTechnical Board\n\n    \n\nThe Technical Board decides on technical process changes and technical policy\ndecisions.\n\nTeam councils\n\n    \n\nThese are specialist councils that govern specific parts of the community.\n\nLet’s now take each layer for a spin and explore how they fit together in the\nwider community. I will also kick off each assessment with the vital\nstatistics of how that part of the community is structured.\n\n### Mark Shuttleworth\n\nReports to: |  No one  \n---|---  \nNumber of members: |  1  \nResponsibilities: |  Special role on Community Council and Technical Board  \n  \nMark Shuttleworth is the founder and primary sponsor of the Ubuntu project. He\nhas poured millions of dollars of his own money into the project. In the wider\ncommunity, Mark has two very distinctive privileges:\n\n  * He can assign Canonical employees to work on specific projects, specific feature goals, and specific bugs.\n\n  * He also has a tie breaking vote on the Technical Board and Community Council, should it be required.\n\nAlthough the first point may be expected, as Mark is the founder and owner of\nCanonical Ltd., the second point may be a surprise. Tinfoil-hat-wearing\nconspiracy theorists could see this as a means of Canonical enforcing its will\non the community. Certainly from my experience, this is really not the case.\n\nObviously every community functions best when it can reach broad consensus\nabout a way forward. Collaborative discussion and decision making is always\nthe desired approach in a volunteer. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon in the\nopen source world for there to be many good arguments, and for arguments to\ndivide communities rather than enrich them. The energy that is focused on\nthese circular debates would always be better spent creating solutions to\nproblems.\n\nIf there is a situation in which the community is deadlocked on a decision,\nwith multiple valid arguments for a given position, Mark can use his casting\nvote to unblock it. Obviously this is not a decision that would be taken\nlightly, and at the time of this writing this casting vote has never been\nrequired since the formation of the project in 2004.\n\n### Community Council\n\nReports to: |  No one  \n---|---  \nNumber of members: |  7  \nResponsibilities: |  General community governance  \n  \nThe Community Council is the primary general governance council in the\ncommunity. It has been present in the community since the inception of the\nUbuntu project and has become a well-respected and instrumental part of the\nwider Ubuntu community.\n\nThe mandate of the Community Council is:\n\n> The social structures and community processes of Ubuntu are supervised by\n> the Ubuntu Community Council. It is the Community Council that approves the\n> creation of a new Team or Project, and appointment of team leaders. In\n> addition, the Community Council is the body responsible for the Code of\n> Conduct and tasked with ensuring that maintainers and other community\n> members follow its guidelines.\n\nThe way members are chosen is discussed in the section [Council or Board\nMember](ch10.html#council_or_board_member \"Council or Board Member\").\n\nIts responsibilities are:\n\n  * Maintaining the Ubuntu Code of Conduct, which describes the standards of behavior expected of Ubuntu maintainers and other community members.\n\n  * Arbitrating disputes under the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. This will happen if a member of the community has asked the Community Council to review the behavior of another member in terms of the Code of Conduct (a document that every Ubuntu member is expected to agree to that outlines basic levels of respectful collaboration).\n\n  * Team creation and appointment of team leaders.\n\n  * Creation of new structures and processes. A community member who wishes to create a new structure or process submits a proposal to the Community Council for discussion and approval. The Community Council determines lines of reporting and responsibility between different community structures.\n\nThe purpose of the Community Council is to provide a group of Ubuntu\ncontributors who have experience working in a range of teams in the community.\nThis group is available to hear any issues, conflicts, or requests that the\ncommunity would like to raise and request a verdict on. Each council member is\nexpected to vote with a +1 (meaning “yes”) or a −1 (meaning “no”). A majority\nvote determines the decision of the Community Council.\n\nImportantly, whenever the Community Council sits to decide on an issue, there\nmust be a quorum: that is, a minimum number of members present to form a\nmajority vote for the body.\n\nThe Community Council has decided on a range of issues over the years. Some\nexamples of this include:\n\n  * The formation of new governance bodies, such as the Forums Council, IRC Council, and MOTU Council (a developer council).\n\n  * Approving and rejecting new members. This was later delegated to the Regional Membership Board (more on this later).\n\n  * Individual conflicts. Sometimes a member who feels a governance body has been inappropriate in judging a case escalates the issue to the Community Council (more on this later, too).\n\n  * The approval of new processes. One example is Monthly Team Reporting for approved teams, which asked teams in the community to provide summarized notes on their work every month.\n\nFor each of these issues the format is the same: the issue is raised with the\ncouncil, it is discussed, and the council members have a vote. The majority\nvote concludes the decision of the Community Council.\n\nAn important consideration has been to make the Community Council as easily\naccessible and approachable to the community as possible. Any community member\nis welcome to raise an issue with the Community Council and have it discussed\nfairly and objectively.\n\nThis is how an item is put forward to the council:\n\n  * The community member adds the item to the Community Council Agenda, which is done by adding it to the Meeting Agenda page at <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncilAgenda>. Every Ubuntu community member is freely able to add items to the agenda.\n\n  * The Community Council meets twice a month to have an online meeting on IRC. Everyone is welcome to attend, and the meeting (at the time of this writing) happens in the #ubuntu-meeting channel on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC network. Meetings happen at 21:00 UTC on the first Tuesday of each month and 11:00 UTC on the third Tuesday of each month. The different times ensure that everywhere in the world has a reasonable chance in her local time zone to attend a meeting at least once a month.\n\n  * At each meeting, the list of agenda items on the <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncilAgenda> page are used as a source of discussion. Each item is discussed and a vote occurs. The majority vote is the concluded opinion of the Community Council.\n\nThis process has served the Ubuntu community well. It has provided a simple\nmethod in which any Ubuntu community member can raise an issue with the\nprimary governing body of the community.\n\n### Technical Board\n\nReports to: |  No one  \n---|---  \nNumber of members: |  4  \nResponsibilities: |  Technical and process governance  \n  \nThe Ubuntu Technical Board has a somewhat unique and sometimes misunderstood\nrole in the community. The Technical Board is intended to advise on the\ntechnical direction of Ubuntu and usually focuses on wide-reaching critical\nissues as opposed to the thousands of smaller technical decisions that are\nmade every day in the community.\n\nAs with the Community Council, the Technical Board has a published mandate:\n\n> The Ubuntu Technical Board is responsible for the technical direction that\n> Ubuntu takes. The Technical Board makes final decisions over package\n> selection, packaging policy, installation system and process, toolchain,\n> kernel, X server, library versions and dependencies, and any other matter\n> which requires technical supervision in Ubuntu.\n\nThere is also a set of published responsibilities for the board:\n\n  * The Ubuntu Packaging Policy, which describes the standards with which Ubuntu packages must comply. Each release of Ubuntu is associated with a specific version of the Package Policy. Ubuntu community members may propose updates and changes to the Package Policy.\n\n### Note\n\nAlthough I try to minimize technical discussions in this book, the concept of\na _package_ appears often enough to deserve a bit of background. Large\nprojects such as Ubuntu are created by hundreds or thousands of teams working\non software as different as word processors, graphing tools, games, scientific\nlibraries, and device drivers. Each team produces one or more packages, in\nwhich form they distribute their software. One of the critical tasks of the\nUbuntu project is to get these packages to work together. Some are more stable\nand trusted than others, so the packages are organized into different\n_repositories_ to reflect such differences.\n\n  * Ubuntu Release Feature Goals, which determine specific features that we aim to include in each release of Ubuntu. These are documented on the wiki pages for each release. Ubuntu community members may propose additional Feature Goals until that release is in Feature Freeze, after which Feature Goals will be deferred to the next release.\n\n  * Ubuntu Package Selection, the list of packages that will be installed in a Base or Desktop Ubuntu installation, as well as the list of packages that qualify for full support in the main repository as opposed to the universe repository. (The main repository is more selective and offers support for its packages.) You may propose packages for inclusion in the Base Install, the Desktop Install, or the main repository, where they will be immediately available to Ubuntu users.\n\nSome readers may be wondering why the Ubuntu community has a separate\nCommunity Council and Technical Board, and feel it would make more sense to\ncombine both into a single entity. The decision to have two governance bodies\nwas deliberate.\n\nThe requirements for the governing members in the Community Council and the\nTechnical Board are very different. Community Council members need to have a\nwide and expansive knowledge of the community, its processes, and its culture.\nIt is entirely reasonable that these members have a more limited technical\nknowledge of Ubuntu: we don’t expect them to be packaging or programming\nninjas. Their expertise is based around general community awareness and\ndecision making as opposed to technical expertise.\n\nThe Technical Board, on the other hand, has very demanding technical\nrequirements for its members. Members should not only have a high level of\ntechnical expertise, but also have contextual knowledge of the entire\ndistribution. As an example, we don’t expect someone to be an expert in just\nthe desktop, but also the entire underlying system, the toolchain, the bug\ndatabase, and more. We call these developers _generalists_ , and they are\nhugely valuable members of software-oriented communities such as Ubuntu.\n\nIn addition to having a strong technical knowledge, Technical Board members\nare expected to have a firm understanding of the processes and community\ninfrastructure of the project; keep abreast of the technology and challenges\non the horizon outside of Ubuntu; and show strong experience in software\ndevelopment, maintenance, and technical collaboration.\n\nUbuntu community members can engage with the Technical Board in much the same\nway as with the Community Council:\n\n  * Everyone is welcome to add items to the Technical Board Agenda page at <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoardAgenda>.\n\n  * The board also meets regularly on IRC, and the community is also welcome to attend.\n\n  * Decisions are again made with a vote based around a quorum of Technical Board members attending the meeting.\n\nThe Technical Board has been hugely successful in providing governance and\nconsidered conclusions in some complex technical decisions. Some of these\ndecisions have involved compelling technical issues, the ethics around\nsoftware freedom, and other areas.\n\nOne example of a contentious topic was a proposal some time ago to have some\nadvanced desktop effects technology switched on by default in Ubuntu. For this\ntechnology to work, it required the computer to have fully working 3D graphics\nhardware. Unfortunately, back in early 2007 some of the most common graphics\nhardware would work effectively only if a closed source, proprietary driver\nwas installed. For the effects technology to be switched on, we would need to\nship a closed source driver that could be installed if the hardware was\npresent.\n\nThis caused enormous controversy inside and outside the Ubuntu community. Many\nwere worried that the core ethic of Free Software would be compromised if the\nproposal went forward. For a while the atmosphere got a little tense, and some\nbloggers assumed the role of prophets of doom, spreading fear of a closed\nsource Ubuntu: “human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together...mass\nhysteria!” (Sorry, I am an outrageous _Ghostbusters_ fan.)\n\nTo handle this feisty topic, a joint meeting between the Ubuntu Technical\nBoard and the Ubuntu Community Council was chaired. The issue was discussed,\nand the combined board united around a common conclusion: Ubuntu would not\nship closed source drivers, but infrastructure would be built that would make\nit devilishly simple to install the drivers if required so that the desktop\neffects technology could be used. The solution was elegant, combining an\nunrelenting commitment to providing ordinary computer users with dazzling\ntechnology and securing the free software ethics that are at the heart of the\nproject. The community wholeheartedly supported the decision and how it was\nconcluded.\n\n### Team councils\n\nReport to: |  Community Council  \n---|---  \nNumber of members: |  Varies; typically 5  \nResponsibilities: |  Specialist governance  \n  \nWhen the Ubuntu community was born, the Community Council and the Technical\nBoard were the only two governance bodies put in place. They smoothly handled\ntheir respective parts of community governance and were productive in that\nwork. As the community grew, though, thousands of contributors joined the\nproject, hundreds of teams were formed, and huge demand was placed on the\nCommunity Council and Technical Board. The Community Council in particular\nbegan to struggle under the workload, and meetings lasting upward of three\nhours were routinely organized to handle the sheer volume of requests.\nSomething needed to change.\n\nAt the 2006 Ubuntu Developer Summit in Mountain View, California, it was\ndecided to form a new layer of governance called team councils. A limited set\nof subcouncils would be set up in parts of the project where repeated requests\nfor governance were made. These councils would then govern those areas of the\ncommunity.\n\nOne such example was the Ubuntu LoCo Teams. This worldwide community of 200+\nlocal Ubuntu user groups would get together to advocate Ubuntu, provide\nsupport, organize release parties, and more. As this part of the Ubuntu\ncommunity continued to grow, its governance needs heightened. Decisions about\nhosting, team naming, documentation, events, team approvals, and more were\nrequired. So the Community Council decided to form a LoCo Council that would\ntend to these decisions.\n\nThe LoCo Council was officially appointed by the Community Council, and the\nnew LoCo Council members were chosen based on their years of experience with\nUbuntu LoCo Teams. The council went on to successfully govern the community.\n\nSimilar councils were set up for other parts of the Ubuntu community,\nincluding the IRC Council, Forums Council, and MOTU Council. In each case, the\nCommunity Council appoints the members, although for new members of existing\ncouncils these appointments are often based on recommendations from the\nexisting council. We discuss how to set up councils such as these in more\ndetail a little later in the chapter.\n\n## Membership\n\nInside the Ubuntu world it doesn’t take long before you see references to “a\nmember of our community” and the prospect of “joining the community.” The\nconcept of _membership_ is something that varies tremendously across different\ncommunities. For some communities, membership is merely taking an interest in\nwhat active members are doing, whereas other communities have a more\nformalized style of membership that requires some kind of approval process.\n\nIn the Ubuntu community anyone is welcome to join and participate, and\nformalized membership is not required. This ensures that the community is open\nfor people to join and dip their toes in. This is great for people new to\nUbuntu, but we do have some more formalized membership roles for those who\nwant to provide a more concrete level of contribution or those who want to\ncontribute to critical parts of the system that require approval. These roles\nare:\n\nUbuntu member\n\n    \n\nThis is a basic level of approved membership that indicates that a contributor\nhas provided a reliable level of contribution. This role doesn’t depend on the\ntype of contribution: people can become members if they do packaging,\ndevelopment, translations, documentation, advocacy, or whatever else is\nrecognized to be of value.\n\nDeveloper\n\n    \n\nFor those who need upload access to our primary software repositories, this\nrole is required. Candidates must adhere to a more complex set of technical\nrequirements.\n\nGovernor\n\n    \n\nThis is a role that applies to anyone on a governance body in the community.\nThis role requires a demonstration of the attributes of a great council\nmember, discussed earlier in this chapter.\n\nEach role has a different set of expectations and requirements. Let’s now\ndelve into each in more detail.\n\n### Ubuntu Member\n\nThis is the first level of formalized membership that someone would shoot for\nupon joining the project. This role essentially guarantees that the\ncontributor has demonstrated effective participation in a large distributed\ncommunity such as Ubuntu. Each prospective member must sign the Ubuntu Code of\nConduct.\n\nTo clarify what this role means, a mandate was defined at the inception of the\nproject:\n\n> Membership in the Ubuntu community recognizes participants for a variety of\n> contributions, from code to artwork, advocacy, translations and\n> organizational skills. If you are active in the Forums, or submitting icons\n> or sounds or artwork, then you are eligible for Membership, which gives you\n> a say in the governance of the project.\n\nOne of the reasons we have the concept of an Ubuntu Member is to help the\nproject identify reliable contributors. Anyone who is approved as a member is\nlikely to understand the basics of what is involved in participating in a\ndistributed project such as Ubuntu. Although this level of membership does not\nguarantee quality of work, it does provide a fairly reliable baseline for\nengagement: it shows that the contributor has a history of providing sustained\ncontributions to a community. This in itself is useful for a range of\npurposes, such as soliciting input, voting, encouraging participation in other\nparts of the project, and mentoring new community members.\n\nUsers apply for membership through the following process:\n\n  1. The user must have a profile on Launchpad, where people engage in Ubuntu work such as packaging, translations, bug triage, and more.\n\n  2. An application document is created on the Ubuntu wiki. This application should include some standard items: a summary of contributions to Ubuntu, a link to the user’s Launchpad profile, a complete description of contributions to Ubuntu, plans and ideas for Ubuntu in the future, and testimonials of other Ubuntu Members who support the application.\n\n  3. The user signs the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. This ensures that the contributor agrees to participate under positive rules of engagement in the community. The vast majority of reasonable and self-aware contributors automatically meet all of the criteria from the Code of Conduct.\n\n  4. The user then adds her application to the next Regional Membership Board meeting. There are three boards—Americas, Europe, and Asia—and each board votes on applications from their regions. As an example, an applicant in Paris applies to the European Membership Board.\n\n  5. The user must attend the meeting (which takes place online) where the board members review the application and ask any relevant questions. After a review, the board votes, and a majority vote is considered approval for membership. If the member is not approved, she is welcome to apply again at a later date.\n\nApproved members also receive some privileges:\n\n  * An [@ubuntu.com](mailto:@ubuntu.com) email alias that forwards to your real email address\n\n  * An ubuntu/member/your_nick hostname IRC cloak\n\n  * The right to print business cards with the Ubuntu logo\n\n  * Syndication on Planet Ubuntu of their blog\n\n  * An Ubuntu Member title at the Ubuntu Forums\n\n  * A free subscription to the _Linux Weekly News_ website\n\nThe concept of Ubuntu membership proved to be hugely valuable, offering a\nreliable assessment for a person’s commitment to Ubuntu and ability to\ncontribute. This approach to membership could be applied easily to most\ncommunities.\n\nBefore I wrap up this section, I want to share an important note: despite\nCanonical investing millions of dollars each year in Ubuntu, this does not\nfast-track employees or step over any existing community processes. I am an\nexample of this. When I joined Canonical as the Ubuntu community manager, I\nwas expected to step before the Community Council, present my application, and\napply for Ubuntu membership. Fortunately I got it. It could have been a little\nweird if I didn’t!\n\nMembership Explosion? Scale It Up!\n\nTraditionally, membership in the community was judged by the Ubuntu Community\nCouncil. As Ubuntu continued to grow in popularity and the community grew at a\nsimilarly frantic pace, the Community Council found itself overstretched in\nits ability to keep up with applications.\n\nThis is the reason the Regional Membership Boards were set up: they offered a\nmore scalable solution to the sheer growth of the project.\n\n### Developer\n\nDevelopment is a critical part of Ubuntu. It is developers who take the\nthousands of open source applications and tools available online, package\nthem, and make them available for easy installation and use on an Ubuntu\nsystem. These developers also fix bugs, deal with security issues, and ensure\nthat these applications and tools integrate properly in the distribution.\n\nAnyone is welcome to apply for a developer role in the Ubuntu community. There\nis no requirement to work at Canonical. In fact, many of the top-level\ndevelopers who work on the most significant parts of Ubuntu are volunteers.\nHaving this level of openness has been a huge boon for transparency in the\nUbuntu project, but it has also required a carefully thought-out process for\nassessing developers, in order to maintain packages’ standards of quality.\nThese standards of quality are equally applied to all prospective developers,\nregardless of whether they work at Canonical.\n\nI’ll talk briefly about these developer roles as they exist at the time of\nthis writing, but it should be noted that we are currently going through\nsomething of a change and adjusting the processes behind these roles. As such,\nI will discuss the current published processes to give you a good idea of an\napproach that has worked well since the beginning of the project. Just don’t\nbe surprised if you look into the Ubuntu community at a later date and the\nlandscape is a little different.\n\nUbuntu is split into a number of different repositories. These are the servers\nthat contain the collections of packages that form the Ubuntu system. There\nare a number of repositories, but two primary ones:\n\nMain\n\n    \n\nThis is the primary, officially supported repository. All of the applications\nhere are considered critical to Ubuntu. They receive security updates, and\nCanonical also supports them in its commercial support services. This\nrepository contains everything that appears on the Ubuntu installation disk.\n\nUniverse\n\n    \n\nThis repository is the entire archive from Debian (which Ubuntu is based on)\nbut with packages built against Ubuntu. In other words, this repository\ncontains the same software as Debian, but tweaked and tested to make sure it\nwill run on Ubuntu. These applications are unsupported: end users are\nresponsible for checking on security updates themselves, and Canonical does\nnot provide support for _universe_ packages in its commercial support\nservices.\n\nEach of these repositories is matched to a specific developer role:\n\nMain→ubuntu-core-dev\n\n    \n\nDevelopers who have direct upload access to _main_ are called _Ubuntu Core\nDevelopers_. These developers demonstrate extensive packaging ability across a\nwide range of areas in the Ubuntu system. To apply for this role, the\ndeveloper must have produced a significant number of packages that have been\nreviewed by existing developers and demonstrated a consistent level of\nexcellent work. The Ubuntu Technical Board is the governing body that makes\ndecisions about who gets approved as an Ubuntu Core Developer.\n\nUniverse→ubuntu-motu\n\n    \n\nDevelopers who want to build packages for _universe_ are called _MOTU\nDevelopers_. MOTU is short for—wait for it—Masters of the Universe. Yes, the\nUbuntu project loves He-Man. Membership in MOTU is less stringent than for\nUbuntu Core Developers, although a substantial competence is required. The\nprocess for applying for MOTU is to have a number of packages reviewed on the\nsponsorship queue (as discussed in [Reviewing new developers: In\ndepth](ch04.html#reviewing_new_developers_colon_in_depth \"Reviewing new\ndevelopers: In depth\")) and then to put forward an application to the MOTU\nCouncil for approval.\n\nBoth of these roles require a consistent grade of quality. Having direct\naccess to the _main_ and _universe_ repositories means that developers can\nhave direct and lasting consequences on millions of Ubuntu users around the\nworld.\n\nWhy Change?\n\nEarlier in this section I informed you that we are currently changing the\nprocesses around how people join the Ubuntu community as developers. The\nreason for this is that we are streamlining the project to make it easier for\npeople to get involved. This is intended to solve some problems with the\ncurrent approach:\n\n  * Today we have two classifications of developer—Ubuntu Core Developers and MOTU Developers—that determine who works on which repository. We should instead have one classification of developer and determine which parts of Ubuntu the developer works on as permissions within his role.\n\n  * Right now, if you become a developer you get access to the full repository. We would like to provide access for contributors to work on specific parts of the archive.\n\n  * We are also adjusting some of the technical processes controlling how contributors participate.\n\nThese changes are ongoing.\n\n### Council or Board Member\n\nThe last type of membership role we will discuss here is that of a member on a\ngoverning body such as the Community Council, the Technical Board, or Forums\nCouncil. How did the Ubuntu community approach identifying suitable community\nmembers for these different governance bodies?\n\nFor most new councils, the primary council members are often handpicked to get\nthe council off on a strong footing. This happened with the Community Council,\nTechnical Board, and most of the team councils, such as the Forums Council,\nIRC Council, and MOTU Council. Typically, the first generation of these\ncouncils is picked by the highest governing body. As an example, the Community\nCouncil was formed by Mark Shuttleworth and the forefathers of Ubuntu. Later\ncouncils, such as the Forums Council, had their initial members nominated by\nthe Community Council.\n\nWhen the council term ends, a new generation of members can be nominated. In\nmost of these cases existing members are welcome to stand again for\nnomination, and there is an open call for other contributors to propose\nthemselves for membership in the body.\n\n## Escalation\n\nEvery community has conflicts and other problems, and I devote [Chapter\n11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\") to these\nissues. Before we get there, I want to discuss how the Ubuntu community\nhandles the escalation of problems and conflict because this is a very clear\nresponsibility that falls under the wing of governance.\n\nThe challenge here is simple: if there is a problem, how does someone get\nadvice from an objective and more experienced third party? What then happens\nif the person with the issue feels that the objective third party was not\nobjective at all? What happens next, and how is the issue escalated?\n\nOur goal is to create an escalation path that starts at the most immediate\ndecision-making body and then progressively pushes the issue farther up the\nchain if a satisfactory conclusion is not reached. The primary reason why\nescalation is important is that you don’t want to trouble the senior levels of\ngovernance unless absolutely required.\n\nLet’s look at an example. The Ubuntu Forums community defines an escalation\npath that looks like [Figure 10-2](ch10.html#escalation_path \"Figure 10-2. The\nForums community has a number of escalation points so that the Forums Council\ndoes not get inundated with every issue.\") (the process begins at the bottom\nof the diagram).\n\n![The Forums community has a number of escalation points so that the Forums\nCouncil does not get inundated with every\nissue.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159267.png)\n\nFigure 10-2. The Forums community has a number of escalation points so that\nthe Forums Council does not get inundated with every issue.\n\nImagine that someone is frustrated that one of his discussion threads in the\nforum was deleted because it was considered offensive. This is how the\nescalation path works (correspond each step to the diagram in the figure):\n\n  1. Forums Thread\n\nThe first place there is likely to be conflict is the main forum. The user\nwill undoubtedly complain loudly, and other forum members will try to discuss\nthe issue and calm the user down. If the contributor wants to escalate this\nfurther, the next stage is reached.\n\n  2. Forum Moderators\n\nThis is a special part of the Ubuntu Forums where users can take complaints.\nOn this level, the forum moderators, who have insight and administrative\ncontrol in the day-to-day running of the forum, can comment on the decision\nmade in the original forum. Hopefully at this level the insight of the\nmoderators is considered suitable third-party input and the issue can be\nsettled. If the user still considers the issue a problem or feels the\nmoderators are not judging it fairly, it can be escalated further.\n\n  3. Forums Council\n\nThe issue is now taken to the Forums Council. The council not only oversees\nthe governance of the wider forums but is also there to judge the\neffectiveness of the moderators. At this level, the Forums Council members\nshould assess the behavior of the moderators in addition to the issue itself.\nIf the Forums Council considers the matter to be handled fairly and\nobjectively by the moderators, the issue should be considered closed. If the\nuser is still not happy, however, he can then escalate the issue to the final\nlevel.\n\n  4. Community Council\n\nAt this point the user is effectively saying that the forum moderators and\nForums Council are all doing a substandard job in assessing the problem. The\nCommunity Council should now assess the verdict of the Forums Council as well\nas the issue itself and pass a verdict. If at this point the user is still\nunhappy, he is going to remain unhappy. But four levels of governance, each\nembodying a wealth of experience and insight into the community, have now\nweighed in on the matter.\n\n# Expanding Governance\n\nOne of the most wonderful attributes of communities is their ability to\nsurprise. From tiny acorns great trees grow, and the branches of community\noften spread far and wide.\n\nWe have seen this countless times, be it Ubuntu, Wikipedia, the Barack Obama\ncampaign, or other communities you may have joined. When your community\nmanages to captivate and develop mindshare, not only does the focus of the\ncommunity grow but so does your membership. More of these people want to be a\npart of the journey that your community is on, and they often share the same\npassion and devotion to reaching the final destination as you do.\n\nAlthough no one is going to quarrel with this growth, it can generate a\nheadache: how on earth do we scale up our governance bodies to manage this\nlarger group of people?\n\nFortunately (in terms of hard problems) or unfortunately (in terms of not many\npeople joining your community), this is a problem that only some of you will\nneed to face.\n\n## Knowing When It Is Time\n\nIn an ideal world we would not need to set up any governance in the first\nplace, let alone set up additional subcouncils. Each additional level of\ngovernance that you add to your community is another step away from being a\nsimple and nimble entity that is clear for everyone to understand. It gets a\nlot ickier when there are Community Councils, team councils, delegated bodies,\nand other such pomp and grandeur. Your community should set up this additional\ngovernance only if _absolutely necessary_.\n\nOf course, many communities need multiple levels of councils, and we certainly\ndiscovered that in the Ubuntu community. Despite its seeming complexity, I\nknow that every piece in the Ubuntu community is _absolutely necessary_ , and\nthat is our ethos here.\n\nAdditional governance is required only when existing governance bodies are not\nable to scale or cater to your community’s requirements. Unfortunately, some\ncommunities don’t quite get this right and decide to set up vanity councils:\ngoverning bodies that achieve nothing more than making the members of the new\ncouncil feel special.\n\nThis can happen in the simplest of scenarios. As an example, imagine that the\nTobe project that we discussed earlier really took off and became the hot new\nthing. If it is like any other successful community, a raft of additional\nresources will be created for the project. One typical example would be\ndiscussion forums. When the forums go online, we would likely see the same\nthing that has happened in other communities: a very passionate yet vocal\ncommunity makes its home in the forums.\n\nAlthough the Tobe Forums community may be small, the vocal few in the forums\nwant to feel special: they want a governing council. In their eyes, governing\ncouncils bring all kinds of fun things: a sense of control, authority, and\npower across the wider project. Not only this, but they see a council as\nrequired for the community to be a _real_ community.\n\nNonsense.\n\nThere is simply no reason for this council. The Tobe Community Council already\nexists as a place to resolve issues, and the wider Tobe community is still\nfairly small. By creating this council you will effectively double the risk of\nbureaucracy.\n\nHere are some indicators of when it might be time to reopen this chapter, blow\noff the dust, and read how to build a council again, but this time a\nsubcouncil:\n\nBottlenecks\n\n    \n\nMany councils face bottlenecks. These typically occur when the existing\ncouncil is failing to organize meetings, a few people on the council are\nholding back their decisions, or there is too much work for the council to do.\nThe first two issues should be solved by fixing your existing council. For the\nthird issue, you may want to see whether the existing council can commit more\ntime to the council. If not, another council may be required.\n\nSpecific knowledge required\n\n    \n\nWhen you form a large subcommunity in a specific area of your community, that\nsubcommunity may require some specific knowledge that your general Community\nCouncil does not possess. When you see many issues occur that require this\nknowledge, a subcouncil may be required. One area that often calls for\nspecific knowledge is conflict resolution in specific parts of the project. As\nan example, conflict in a developer community will require knowledge of both\nthe people involved and the development tools and processes.\n\nSeparation of skills\n\n    \n\nWhen you have a general Community Council up and running, you may find that a\nnumber of requests fall into one specific category and that these requests\nneed more focus and experience. An example is if you get lots of technical\nrequests that require extensive knowledge. This may warrant the formation of a\nTechnical Board.\n\nLocale/language\n\n    \n\nIf you have a large community forum around a specific language or locale and\nthe people there are struggling to communicate with the main Community\nCouncil, a regional council or language-focused council may be required.\n\nEach of these situations exceeds the time, knowledge, or skills of the\nexisting governance body. The quantity of requests is the justification for\nthe subcouncil: if you get only a few domain-specific requests that your\nCommunity Council struggles to deal with, a separate council may not be\nrequired, but if the council gets regular and repeated requests, it is worth\nconsidering.\n\nThere are many examples where the issues just described resulted in the\nformation of councils. One such example, mentioned earlier, was the formation\nof the Ubuntu Membership Boards. In terms of expertise, the Community Council\nwas capable of handling each membership request, but the sheer volume made it\nunfeasible. These three subcouncils were formed to cover the Americas, Europe,\nand Asia, and took over the responsibility of reviewing Ubuntu membership\nrequests.\n\nAnother example was the formation of the Forums Council, triggered by the\noverwhelming demand for governance and forums experience in the forums\ncommunity. Similar considerations also spawned the Ubuntu MOTU Council, which\ngoverns the developer community that builds packages for parts of Ubuntu. The\ncouncil was formed from existing MOTU developers to provide a better level of\nknowledge for assessing new developer requests. All of these examples have\nultimately been successful in governing their respective parts of the\ncommunity.\n\n## Building the Subcouncil\n\nFortunately, once you have been through the process of building your main\nCommunity Council and have justified to yourself and your community that a\nsubcouncil is required, forming this new subcouncil is relatively\nstraightforward. All you need to do is repeat the steps earlier in this\nchapter that explained how to form a new council.\n\nWhile following the process, you should take extra care to codify the council\nthoroughly. You should consult heavily with your community and expect a\nbarrage of questions seeking to justify the new council.\n\nYour community is going to be nervous about new governance, and you will\nlikely notice a slight paranoia that some of their rights are going to vanish\nas they perceive the cold chains of bureaucracy clanking down hard on the\ncommunity. If you’ve followed the careful thought processes I’ve described,\nsuch concerns are ridiculous.\n\nWe are all here to show bureaucracy who is boss, and ensure that it has no\nhome in our communities. Make sure your community knows this. This will\nrequire ensuring that your codification is easy to read and understand, and\nregular reassurance to your community about the scope and responsibility of\nthe new governance body.\n\nWhen you have a broadly acceptable codification in place, the next step is to\nrun it past the existing Community Council. You should expect the document to\ngo back and forth with the council a few times before it is considered\ncomplete. When this is ready, you are all set to ask the Community Council to\nnominate members for the new council and optionally have an election with your\ncommunity members to select from these nominees.\n\n### Escalation\n\nWith at least two councils in place, you should now ensure that your community\nis entirely clear on how each council works and also how they fit together.\nMore specifically, your community needs to know how issues can be escalated\nfrom one council to another.\n\nTo do this, you should write an _issue escalation document_ that illustrates\nclearly how an issue should flow through your governance structure. Here is an\nexample of how this document could be applied to the Tobe community with its\nCommunity Council and Forums Council.\n\nTobe Community Forums Issue Escalation\n\nIn the Tobe community, we have two governing bodies that are available to\nresolve and manage issues. These are:\n\n  * Tobe Community Council—This council is the highest-serving governing body in the Tobe community. It discusses and decides on general community issues, policies, and processes. This council is also the top-level platform to discuss conflict issues.\n\n  * Tobe Forums Council—The Forums Council governs the Tobe forums community and reports to the Tobe Community Council.\n\nIf you have a problem or concern, these governance structures are available to\nlisten and pass judgment on the issue in question.\n\nIf you have a FORUMS issue, you should first add your issue to the Tobe Forums\nCouncil agenda by clicking [here]. Do not take your issue to the Tobe\nCommunity Council; you will be immediately asked to refer to the Tobe Forums\nCouncil first.\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the service you have received from the Tobe\nForums Council, you are welcome to escalate the issue to the Tobe Community\nCouncil. Please note that by doing this you are effectively stating the\nfollowing:\n\n  * You believe that either the issue was not fairly and objectively considered by the Tobe Forums Council or that the council members do not possess the knowledge to effectively pass judgment on the issue in question.\n\n  * You are happy for the Tobe Community Council to perform an assessment of how effective the members of the Tobe Forums Council were in assessing the issue.\n\nTo escalate the issue, add an item to the Tobe Community Council Agenda by\nclicking [here].\n\nWe discuss how these escalation incidents are specifically addressed in\n[Chapter 11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\").\n\n## Communicating Between Councils\n\nWhen I originally discussed how to build a new council, I stressed just how\nimportant it is that you create communication channels for the council. This\nis an expected resource in each and every council that your community puts\ntogether. It allows the council to share ideas, deliberate on topics, and\nreach decisions.\n\nFriends, the communication love doesn’t end there, though. Now we must put our\ndevious little minds to another opportunity: how can we help our multiple\ncouncils communicate with one another? The reason and inspiration behind this\nshared cross-council communication are those two magical words in community\nmanagement: _best practice_.\n\nIf you have two councils that are formed (e.g., a Community Council and a\nForums Council), you essentially have two groups of motivated, responsible,\nobjective, and reliable people. Although each member on these councils should\nhave a minimum level of suitability for the council based on the attributes\nthat we discussed earlier in this chapter, there is oodles of potential for\nthese council members to learn from one another and further improve and refine\ntheir governance abilities.\n\nTo do this, I recommend you set up an additional mailing list on which you ask\nevery council member in your community to be a member. I know, I know, you are\nprobably getting a little sick of setting up all of these mailing lists, and I\nam by no means encouraging _mailing list fetishism_ , but this cross-council\nlist will be a valuable resource. Another added benefit of this list is that\nit lets you address all of the governing members of your community in one\nplace, which is helpful for sharing best practices.\n\nAlthough it may seem a little less-than-transparent, I again recommend that\nthis governance mailing list be a closed, members-only list with closed\narchives that only the current council members in your community can access.\nThe reasons for this are the same reasons behind the recommendations for each\ncouncil to have a private mailing list: for honest and frank conversation to\nflourish, they often need a context that is unmonitored.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn this chapter we have covered one of the most critical components in\ncommunity management. Although governance has the ability to glaze eyes, it is\na key ingredient in producing a healthy, vibrant, and accessible community.\n\nOf course, governance is a large and complex subject, and the academic brigade\nhas written many books on the topic. I have tried my damnedest to cover this\nsometimes-dusty topic as simply as possible and to give you an overview of the\nprimary elements that are important in most communities. This chapter should\ngive you a great head start in producing a governance system that is simple,\nunobtrusive, and fair to your entire community.\n\n\n# Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\n\n“The people to fear are not those who disagree with you, but those who\ndisagree with you and are too cowardly to let you know.”\n\n—Napoleon Bonaparte\n\nBack in 2007, I was packing my suitcase to head to a conference in Europe.\nTired of trying to cram everything into a tiny bag, I decided to check my\nemail, where I had received a somewhat concerned note from a member of a user\ngroup.\n\nThe group (which shall remain unnamed) had been experiencing some rather ugly\nconflict between two members fighting for leadership. Both individuals felt\nthey were the better choice for leadership but were rather ironically\ndemonstrating their clear lack of leadership experience by having a public\nspat in the interests of securing power. The poor soul who sent me the\nconcerned email informed me that the situation was making the user group not a\nvery fun place to be. I responded, and in the interest of not missing my plane\nI returned to resolving my own conflict between my underpants and travel bag.\n\nA little while later, another email arrived about the same group, sharing\nsimilar concerns and calling out one of the leaders for being unprofessional,\nbullish, and impolite to the members of the group. While I was reading the\nemail, another arrived. This one (replete with a flurry of uppercase,\nhighlighted, and boldface statements) defended the actions of the leader I had\noriginally read about. In contrast, this writer accused the other leader of\ncorruption and misconduct in the group. Somewhat concerned, I replied to each\nemail to say I would be in touch but had to literally run out the door to get\ninto the cab that would take me to the airport.\n\nAs I sat in the cab, I pondered how I was going to handle the situation. In\nbetween the barrage of opinion spurting from the cabbie’s somewhat foul mouth\nabout how the economy was on the brink of melting, I was somewhat preoccupied\nwith trying to flesh out a solution to the complex situation that confronted\nme. (In retrospect, it seems that cabbie wasn’t as much of a whack job as I\nfirst thought….)\n\nBetween getting in the cab, getting to the airport, and getting online, all of\nwhich took about 45 minutes, I had received another 6 emails from the same\ngroup, all from different people. Clearly something was very, very wrong\nthere. Each email had a strong opinion. Some correspondents supported one\nleader or the other, but most were sick and tired of the arguments, shouting\nmatches, and inability to listen. A community that was once rewarding and fun\nto be a part of had turned into a roller coaster with a chunk of track\nmissing.\n\nWhat happened next was the largest conflict resolution experience of my career\nto date. It resulted in a slew of meetings, soliciting feedback (which\ngenerated more than 60 emails in response over the course of a single day),\nand driving forward to a solution that sought to satisfy both of the proposed\nleaders and the wider community. We got there in the end, but it was a tense\nfew weeks in an environment in which carefully chosen words, detailed next\nsteps, and patience all took center stage.\n\n# The Nature of the Beast\n\nConflict is part and parcel of life. We see it every day on television; hear\nit every day on the radio; and read about it every day in our email, social\nnetworking websites, newspapers, magazines, and books. Most of the time, Louis\nArmstrong provides the soundtrack to our wonderful world, but every so often\nlife gets a little edgy and our soundtrack is replaced with one from Slayer.\n\nYou should absolutely expect conflict in your community. No community to date\nhas been unblemished by conflict, and its presence is no reflection on your\ncommunity, its members, or its leaders. You could tirelessly spend each and\nevery day making the tiniest of considerations and changes, refining your\nprocesses and governance to the nth degree, and ensuring that you are\nregularly checking in on the happiness of your members, and you will still\nfind conflict lurking somewhere.\n\nThe reason is simple: people are people, and sometimes people just don’t get\non. You may have two people who have similar interests, similar backgrounds,\nand similar perspectives but just rub each other the wrong way. People are big\nbags of variables: different cultures, opinions, approaches, ideas, values,\nand more. When one big bag of variables doesn’t match another equally big bag\nof variables, spats, arguments, and fuss ensue.\n\nThere is a science out there that explains how conflict occurs, but it is\ngrounded in this plethora of variables, stimuli, nature-versus-nurture\ndebates, and other elements. It is possible to devote your life to the topic:\nthere is a sea of content about the psychology of conflict, anger management,\ncultural impact, expectations, and negotiation skills. Although you are\nwelcome to submerge yourself in this academia, much of it will not be\nparticularly useful when trying to figure out how to untwist the knickers of\ntwo people caught up in a fracas.\n\nAs a general rule, conflict is rare, and it doesn’t need a lifetime of\ndevotion to the library of academia. What it needs are straight, practical,\nhands-on approaches to dealing with common situations. With this in mind I\nwanted to include this chapter as a summary of the most important things to\nknow when dealing with your community’s conflict. It will give you the tools\nfor handling the level of conflict you are likely to deal with.\n\n## The Structure of Strife\n\nLet’s kick off the chapter by exploring some of the high-level elements\ninvolved in conflict. The following are three fundamental ingredients that are\noften present in a conflict:\n\nConfident/free-thinking personalities\n\n    \n\nTypically the participants in the conflict are not exactly wallflowers. They\nare often strong personalities who are not afraid to speak up when they are\nunhappy.\n\nIncompatible goals/values\n\n    \n\nThere are invariably one or more goals or values that the participants\ndisagree on. Importantly, these are typically _perceived_ goals and values.\nThe reality is often very different, as we will explore later in this chapter.\n\nInteraction\n\n    \n\nThe fact that two strong personalities disagree on goals or values does not in\nitself cause conflict; it is the manner in which these personalities interact\nthat causes the sparks to fly. The source and nature of the interaction is\noften a key component in the conflict.\n\nConflict is a little like really bad food. There are many strong flavors out\nthere (these are our personalities), and many of them have distinctive\npurposes (these are our goals/values). When the ingredients are in their boxes\nand bottles in your kitchen cupboard, they are innocent and innocuous.\nHowever, putting them together in the same dish can potentially create\nsomething that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth for a long time. On\nthe other hand, strong flavors put together in the right way can complement\none another and produce stunning outcomes and tastes that become memorable,\nlong-lasting, and incredibly enjoyable.\n\nRather unsurprisingly, conflict does not make for healthy community. Conflict\nis the acid that slowly erodes community: it causes uncertainty that thrives\nin an uncomfortable and unpleasant environment. With a community generally\npopulated with volunteers, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand\nhow unappealing this kind of environment can be.\n\nAlthough an irksome aspect of human behavior, conflict does offer us valuable\ninsight. It helps us to identify the personalities in a community, it\ndemonstrates a sense of passion in your members, and it shows very clearly\nthat your community is alive and thriving as opposed to a lifeless husk.\nConflict is always going to be present in a thriving community, and strangely\nit is one metric of success.\n\nThis reminds me of an incident that happened a few years back when I wrote a\nblog entry on <http://www.jonobacon.org/> and received an awfully mean-\nspirited and nasty comment: personal, full of vitriol, and entirely\nunnecessary. As soon as I read it I became very self-reflective and worried\nthat the statement may have represented the views of more than that\nindividual. In doing so, I entirely failed to balance the picture and consider\nthe countless pleasant comments and wonderful email that I received. My mind\nzoned in on the negative.\n\nIn the midst of all of this, I logged on to discover a message from my friend\nChristian Schaller:\n\n> Hey Jono. I saw that comment on your blog, you must be delighted!\n\nWhen I asked in what possible dimension that comment would make me happy,\nChristian responded with:\n\n> For someone to write that it means that they care what you think, so much so\n> they felt the need to write it on your website. Congratulations!\n\nIn a strange and twisted way, Christian was right. When people care about\nsomething, it will often inspire them to take great lengths to protect it from\nsomething they disagree with. When this happens, conflict brews.\n\nAs a community leader, your community will look to you for guidance and advice\nwhen conflict rears its ugly head. You need to be prepared to step in and\nprovide security and confidence. You need the skills to handle conflict in a\nway that is professional and reasoned, and subscribes to the underlying values\nof your community.\n\nConflict resolution in a volunteer community is very different from conflict\nresolution in a formal organization such as a company or a government agency.\nCommunity conflict often requires more sensitivity and restraint. The risk\nassociated with putting a foot in the wrong place with community conflict\nresolution is that any party who is unhappy with your solution may well leave.\nIf you have to deal with conflicts too often, you may end up losing many great\nmembers of your community. In more formal settings, the likelihood of\nemployees leaving after conflict is much reduced, as they have to earn a\nliving and put food on the table for their family.\n\n# The Calm Before the Storm\n\nConflict resolution is a skill that is heavily grounded in experience.\nHandling conflict teaches a new lesson every time, and these lessons help\ndefine an approach, a sensibility, and a method. This experience has also been\nshown to develop one significant skill: the ability to detect and preempt\nconflict before it even happens.\n\nConflict does not just appear out of nowhere. A series of utterances and\ninteractions occur, each one evidence of the brewing storm, before the\nconflict ultimately reaches the somewhat irksome plateau of a spat. If you can\nsee and detect these indicators, you have the opportunity to step in before\nthe going really gets rough.\n\nAlthough every community is different, many of these warning signs are shared\nacross all communities. Let’s now take a spin through some of these indicators\nof a conflict on the horizon. As we explore these topics, we will end each\ndiscussion with a quick and dirty set of preventive bullet points that you can\njot down to help avoid these issues in the first place.\n\n## Contentious Personalities\n\nOne of the most delightful attributes of community is its ability to energize\nand enable people. Without having any prior experience or reputation, many go\non to develop expertise and respect by starting at the beginning and\nleveraging the opportunity of community to do amazing things. One underlying\nattribute that makes this possible is the openness involved in community:\neveryone in a volunteer community is welcome to join and participate. With\nsuch openness as the norm, the exceptions to the rule—when people who actually\nget rejected from a community—are usually those who perform gross misconduct\nthat socially disappoints the wider community. Thankfully these kinds of\nincidents are rare.\n\nIf we draw a conceptual line that puts the ideal polite and engaged\ncontributor on the far left of the line and the frustrating, imbecilic clod on\nthe far right, there is a significant scale in between where the vast majority\nof your contributors will find their home. Those personalities who edge\nfarther toward the right of that line are prime candidates for causing\nfrustration and conflict. Let’s explore this in more depth.\n\n### Profiling the polemical\n\nIn my time working with community I have experienced a range of personalities\nthat have been controversial, disruptive, and at times outright infuriating.\nWithin this realm, it is tempting to shun each figure as an undesirable member\nof your community and try to disengage from him in the hope that he will move\non to annoy someone else.\n\nIn many cases, though, this is a crying shame. Some community members can\nappear irritating and troublesome at first, but when you give them the benefit\nof the doubt, you and they can often grow to work well together. This all\nboils down to understanding personality differences and the causes behind\nthem.\n\nWhen you deal with conflict, you are invariably dealing with cases in which\nsomeone just doesn’t like someone else, largely due to personality\ndifferences. If you can understand and reconcile these differences, progress\ncan be made. Let’s first look at some of the reasons why people may appear\nvexing to others:\n\nAge\n\n    \n\nAlthough many will deny it, age can dramatically affect how people engage in\ncommunity. This can vary from methods of communication (younger people often\nshorten and codify their language, such as with “txtspeak” and “lolspeak”) to\ndifferent values, perspectives, opinions, and approaches. In many cases\nyounger people are more trigger-happy, adventurous, and argumentative than\nolder people, and this can be a prominent source of conflict. As many people\nget older, they become “set in their ways” and less likely to change and\nreflect on their views. Although this naturally does not affect everyone, it\ndoes apply to many.\n\nCulture\n\n    \n\nWith so many communities living online and garnering an international\naudience, culture can play a big role. This can affect temperament,\npreparedness, approach, and other elements. Culture can be a subtle\ncontributor to conflict: often these differences are difficult to spot unless\nyou are intimately familiar with both cultures. This is also a sensitive\ntopic, as the acknowledgment of cultural differences can often be wrongly\ninterpreted as racism. Tread carefully, Obi-Wan.\n\nOpinions\n\n    \n\nIt is interesting how some people just seem to have more opinions than others.\nThese people can be both a blessing and a curse. If you put two of these\nopinion-laden folks together, things can get fiery quickly. The subtlety here\nis not in whether someone has an opinion but in how constructively that person\ncan express it.\n\nExperience\n\n    \n\nThe level of each person’s knowledge of the subject and the community itself\ncan play a huge part in conflict issues. Sometimes those with more experience\nin the community expect those with less experience to know more, and\nconsequently frustration builds. Not good.\n\nThe interesting commonality among all these attributes is that people can and\nhave been known to mature in each area. Understanding this maturity can be the\nkey to understanding your wider community and its personal development better.\nIt can also be an important topic to communicate when things get contentious.\n\nCommunity participation is a little like starting a new career. In the\nbeginning, you make unintentional mistakes. Failing to see the mistakes, you\nneed to have people point them out for you so that you can learn. The reason\nfor these mistakes is not because you are stupid, but simply because you don’t\nknow the ropes yet. When you learn how things work, the mistakes usually\ndecline consistently until they become rare blips in an otherwise perfect\nsignal.\n\nFrom a community leadership perspective, it is essential to understand the\nimportance of allowing people to mature. You are going to come across some\npeople who frustrate you. Some of these people will make every mistake in the\nbook, and at times it will make you question your own faith in community (“How\ncan we ever achieve our goals with people like this in the world?”).\n\nTo really _feel_ this growth in people, you need to experience it. After a few\nyears of conscious awareness of how people mature, you are sure to see and\nexperience examples of it happening in your community. For example, a guy\njoined a user group that I had formed and proceeded to break every possible\nrule, social convention, and principle in the group. He frustrated many, some\nof whom lit their torches and called for his ousting. Although there was\nlittle doubt that he was a frustrating force in an otherwise calm community, I\nhad a hunch that he had the ability to change. I held strong, and I encouraged\npatience among my fellow community members; before long, we started to see\nimprovement.\n\nAs the guy spent more time in the community he learned how it worked, began to\ntake part in the culture as opposed to questioning it, and eventually became\none of the most proficient and well-respected members. Today others look to\nhim for advice and guidance; it just took him a little while to get there.\n\n### Sharing feedback about personality issues\n\nWhen I studied at university one of my roommates had developed what can be\npolitely described as an _odor issue_. Less politely, he smelled bloody awful;\na unique bouquet of vinegar, onions, and pee all mixed together. Dip your\nbread in that oil, my friends. Although everyone knew of the funk that\nfollowed him around, no one wanted to tell him.\n\nI felt awful for the guy, as I had the hunch he didn’t know he smelled that\nway. One evening I sucked down some confidence and talked to him about it in a\nsensitive but honest way. He was stunned; he had absolutely no idea about the\nfunk, but was committed to fixing it. He showered more often, amped up his\ndeodorant, and cleaned his clothes more often and the problem went away. It\nwas unpleasant to tell him the news, but it was the right thing to do.\n\nThere will be times when you are going to need to sit down with some of your\ncommunity members and share some feedback that other people don’t want to\nshare. In many cases the recipients of your feedback will be as in the dark\nabout their issues as my roommate was about his.\n\nThere are two examples I want to share that I think illustrate this pretty\nwell.\n\nIn one of the communities I have worked with, there was a guy who we shall\nrefer to as _Bob_. Bob was a committed and hard-working member of the\ncommunity and contributed to many different areas, but primarily technical\ndevelopment. While he had grown a strong reputation as a technical expert in\nthe community, he had also started to develop a reputation for being a bit\ndifficult to work with.\n\nThis reputation stemmed from the very direct and almost aggressive way in\nwhich he responded to some of the changes that occurred in the project’s\npolicies and technologies. When he first started responding in this way we\npresumed he was particularly frustrated by the issue in question, but when he\nresponded in a similar way to _many, many_ issues, he started developing a\nreputation for being a grumpy, miserable sod.\n\nThis was a shame. He was an awesome contributor and a really nice guy, and I\nhad a hunch that he probably didn’t realize he was doing this.\n\nOne day I called him and gently shared this feedback. He had no idea about the\nimpression he was leaving, and was thankful to hear my news albeit concerned\nabout his reputation being tarnished. I reassured him that I felt this was a\ncompletely recoverable situation and recommended he just reevaluate some\nelements of the way he shared his perspectives. I also offered to review some\nof his responses before he sent them. Within a few weeks the issue was\nresolved.\n\nMy second example was not driven by the frustration of others, but rather was\nsomething I observed in a community member’s behavior.\n\nWhile attending a series of discussion sessions at a technology event, I\nnoticed that someone participating in the conversations seemed to have a\nfairly short-tempered way of expressing his opinions. He was also noticeably\ndefensive when others challenged his opinions or suggestions, and this\nsometimes caused a slight tension in the room.\n\nAlthough no one had complained to me about this, I noticed it and I had a\nsneaking suspicion he probably had no idea he was doing it. Again, I sat down\nand shared this feedback in a sensitive manner. As I had guessed, he was\noblivious to the fact that he was responding and communicating in this way.\nDuring the next session after I shared this feedback, he was much calmer and\nless defensive, and the tension evaporated.\n\nI learned some valuable lessons in these experiences. First, just because\nsomeone exhibits a personality trait (positive or less so) does not\nnecessarily mean he is aware of it. Second, you should present this feedback\nas a friend rather than as a leader; the feedback should not feel like a\nperformance review or a scolding. You should also present this feedback within\nthe context that you would want the recipient to be aware of it so that he can\nrespond and react to the issue if he wants to. Finally, always use either\nface-to-face or video/audio mediums (e.g., phone) to share this news; you want\nthe recipient to hear the humanity in your voice as you share the feedback.\nEmail and chat channels are not the right mediums for this kind of feedback.\n\n### Poisonous people\n\nWhile some people are able to grow and mature, some outright bad apples may\nunfortunately join your community. Some of these people will be obvious\n(posting loud, obnoxious, or offensive comments), but some will be far subtler\nand more devious.\n\nThe latter are often known as _poisonous people_. These are the people who\nexpress dissatisfaction with your community or direction, and actively seek\nothers to join their campaign of negativity. These people are not only\ninterested in expressing their own concerns, but also want to build a coup of\ncounteropinion against your community.\n\nMany of these poisonous people often operate under the radar. The\nconversations will typically happen in private with only one side of the\nperspective represented, but their actions will lead to substantial conflict\nthat threatens the entire community. Try to be aware of who these people are.\nTypically their names will come up in conversations where it becomes clear\nthey are expressing private concerns and negativity with multiple people.\nExpressing concern does not make people poisonous, but privately rallying\nsupport against the community without any discussion or debate of the issues\nin the common communication space _does_ make them poisonous.\n\nYou should handle these known entities with caution: jarring moves in their\ndirection can dial up the poison even further. You need to fight poisonous\npeople not with words but with evidence. Disprove their comments with calm and\nreasoned commentary amply bolstered with third-party references and evidence.\nYou can then let your community members make up their own minds.\n\n### Tips for Avoiding Conflict\n\n  * Understand the factors that can affect how people conduct themselves in a community.\n\n  * If someone is causing conflict, assess how much you feel she could mature. If you have faith, encourage the detractors to share that faith.\n\n  * Identify poisonous people and watch them carefully. Give them additional attention to limit their damage: identify their concerns, discuss them, try to weed out any communication errors, and generally try to calm their concerns and worries.\n\n## Barriers to Input\n\nOne of the most basic concepts in most volunteer communities is _openness_.\nFor a volunteer community to thrive, openness is necessary to secure the\nimpression that your community members can have a tangible impact on the\ndirection and focus of the wider community. You always want your community to\nthrive on the opportunity to discuss, debate, and reason, and for their views\nto be listened to and acted on where appropriate. In other words, your\ncommunity should always feel that their input is welcome. It may not be acted\non, but it should be received in good faith.\n\nAs we discussed in [Chapter 10](ch10.html \"Chapter 10. Governance\"), not all\ncommunities are created equal. Some are driven in a dictatorial fashion by\nspecific people or by handpicked rock stars. Some communities are far more\nopen, and some are leaderless and driven by consensus and action. It is\nimportant that the expectations around input are accurately communicated. If\nyour community is pushing, as part of its core values, openness and the\nencouragement of input and contribution, you need to ensure that people can\nactually do that. If they can’t, you are going to have some angry villagers on\nyour hands.\n\nSo, before you respond to criticism, don’t start from the assumption that it\nis unfounded. Take a good, hard look at your community and determine whether a\nproblem really does exist. If it does, fix it. Reread this book and ensure\nthat you are implementing all the tips scattered throughout regarding open\nengagement. And invite the critics to help, if they are at all competent and\nconciliatory.\n\nBickering can often occur in communities driven by a commercial sponsor.\nRegardless of how open your governance is and how well the sponsor’s paid\nstaff members engage the rest of the community, volunteers will always worry\nabout having less input in the community than paid staff members. It’s easy to\nsee why: if a company puts your community at the center of its universe and\nthrows some dollars at it, it is likely that it will have a vested interested\nin making its money work for it. This could _theoretically_ affect the weight\nof participants’ opinions about the community’s direction.\n\n### Note\n\nFolks, notice the nicely emphasized _theoretically_ in the previous statement.\nThe reason for this is that I was playing devil’s advocate a little. Many\ncommunities have paid sponsors, and in my experience most sponsors respect the\nexisting lines in the sand that the community has drawn and don’t throw their\ncommercial weight around. It is important not to automatically associate “paid\nsponsor” with “in charge of direction.”\n\nIf your community has a paid sponsor, you need to go out of your way to ensure\nthat the community members still feel they are able to contribute. If your\ncommunity is open and transparent and has facilities to engage with community\ndevelopment, ensure that you celebrate those facilities and regularly remind\nyour community that they will be treated no differently from those\nrepresenting the commercial interest. If a community member is citing claims\nof unfairness due to this commercial sponsor, the only way you can achieve\nthis is to build trust. To do this, I recommend that you get on the phone with\nthis person, get all the issues out on the table, clarify areas of confusion\nand miscommunication, and build a schedule of regular communication to tend to\nand provide feedback on the issues that were raised. You don’t need to always\nprovide solutions, but you do need to have your ear to the ground and be\nsensitive to problems and issues.\n\nIf you are a community manager for a commercial sponsor, you may find yourself\nin the difficult spot of the sponsor demanding something that the community\ndoesn’t want. This is a complex and sensitive situation to manage, and you\nshould tread carefully.\n\nYou should begin by determining exactly what the sponsor (who may well be your\nboss) wants and how it can achieve this with the least amount of disruption to\ncommunity goodwill, governance, or processes. If the sponsor is determined to\nget this work done and is willing to step outside published governance, you\nshould get an outline of the proposed work, submit it to the community, and\nask the governing body (if it exists) to gather community feedback on the\nproposed plan and provide a summary of the community’s feelings on it. If the\nsponsor chooses to ignore this opinion and go ahead, you need to make it very,\nvery clear that it could significantly harm community relations.\n\nRegardless of whether there is a commercial sponsor, the trick here is to pay\nattention when people feel they don’t have input into decisions and/or\ndirection. When there is a sense of lost control, people will often bottle it\nup and only discuss it with a few other friends who they feel will sympathize\nwith them. These people are not poisonous, and there is no malice behind their\nactions; they just don’t know where to turn and feel that they are not being\nlistened to. In such circumstances, the issue can quickly blow out of\nproportion. If you get a whiff that something is not quite right, investigate\nit immediately and reassure the concerned parties that things have not changed\nand the community is still as volunteer-focused as it has ever been.\n\nTo reassure your community, you should remind them of the community-facing\nresources that encourage people to submit their ideas and views. In the Ubuntu\ncommunity, we put the following in place to encourage an environment of\nopenness and collaboration:\n\nMailing lists\n\n    \n\nA range of public mailing lists are available, complete with publicly visible\narchives.\n\nBrainstorm website\n\n    \n\nThis is a website in which people can submit ideas to be voted on. This offers\na great list of items that are high-priority in the minds of the Ubuntu user\ncommunity.\n\nPublic IRC channels\n\n    \n\nThis range of publicly accessible IRC chat channels is where Canonical staff\nmembers perform most of their work, and therefore have a virtual ear to the\nground.\n\nSponsored developer participation\n\n    \n\nCanonical also sponsors many community developers to the twice-annual Ubuntu\nDeveloper Summit. This encourages strong community participation.\n\nThese resources and their open and participatory nature should speak legions\nin the interest of welcoming your community’s input and ideas. Although you\nshould certainly remind your members of these open facilities, you should also\ngo one step further. If you have a serious complaint on your hands from\nsomeone who feels that her input is not welcome, you should dig through these\nresources and find examples when the community has been involved in a\nproductive change. Pointing to a public mailing list is one thing, but\npointing to five productive conversations on that mailing list that illustrate\nyour community’s openness is much more valuable.\n\nI have one final note about this particular cause of conflict. You should\nexpect that some people will generate conflict simply because they offered\ninput and their input was not acted on. As an example, someone may recommend\nthat your community takes a particular direction, but for various reasons that\ndirection is not taken and the original provider of the input gets agitated\nand makes claims that he is not being listened to. This is nothing more than\ngriping.\n\nYou will always need to deal with these kinds of accusations: you simply can’t\nplease all the people all the time. In this scenario the solution is to again\nprovide evidence that your community has engaged in input. But do be frank:\ntell the complainer that sometimes people don’t get their way. Provide\nexamples of how you have not gotten your way as a counter to him feeling\nisolated and singled out.\n\n### Tips for Avoiding Conflict\n\n  * Ensure that there are very clear channels in which your community can engage.\n\n  * Ensure that feedback, opinions, and ideas _are_ discussed, considered, and engaged with.\n\n  * If part of a commercial sponsor, always ensure that your staff members are publicly engaging and not hiding in private communication channels.\n\n## Problems with Responsibility\n\nEvery community contains groups of people who have clear and perceived\nresponsibilities. These folks are commonly seen as leaders who make decisions\nand the real movers and shakers who represent the wider community. These\npeople with responsibility can include:\n\nGoverning members\n\n    \n\nMembers of councils, boards, advisory groups, and more\n\nTeam leaders\n\n    \n\nPeople who run the many and varied teams your community may have in place\n\nCommunity managers\n\n    \n\nPeople specifically given the responsibility to help advise the community and\nsmooth out any bumps in how it works\n\nSponsored leaders\n\n    \n\nProminent members of the community who fund significant chunks of it and\npossibly pay staff members to work with it\n\nEach role brings an expectation around engagement. Your community will expect\na certain degree of professionalism, responsibility, and responsiveness. When\na member feels these attributes are compromised, up pops the big hairy eyeball\nthat points at said leader. I don’t like hairy eyeballs, and neither should\nyou.\n\nThere are two primary causes of this conflict that happen far more in\ncommunities than they should, and both are interlinked.\n\nThe first is having too many eggs in one basket. This is when a single person\nhas too much responsibility and control over a given part of the community.\nThis can happen a lot with resource management. It is common to have one\nperson as the single point of contact for administering mailing lists,\naccounts, forums, or other resources. This is all fine and dandy when that\nperson can keep up with the maintenance requests, but when that falters,\nfrustration follows closely after.\n\nThis ties into the second issue: responsiveness, a problem that has plagued\nevery community. The reason is fairly obvious when you consider it: community\nleaders are typically highly motivated, fidgety people who have no problem\nkeeping themselves occupied. Busy people tend to become really busy people,\nand it is not uncommon for them to take on a little too much. Too many\nresponsibilities and not enough time is a recipe for further community\nfrustration.\n\n### Note\n\nRemember that you could be a bottleneck, too. If you find that your TODO list\nis spiraling out of control, it is likely you are a bottleneck. Check which\nitems are blocking on you, and try to spread them out to more people.\n\nIf left untended, these issues can cause wider annoyance and even nastiness.\nThis happened in a community in which I played a loose role a few years back.\nThere was a single community member who maintained many of the resources the\ncommunity used. This person always denied additional help and contributions\nand wanted to handle the resources himself. As time went on, he became\nincreasingly difficult to get a hold of. Maintenance requests were largely\nignored. Frustration set in and thus emerged accusations of ego, self-\nobsession, the willingness to put personal interests ahead of the community,\nand other irksome claims.\n\nWhile at a conference, I was chatting to a friend of mine about these issues\nand he gave me a piece of advice that has stayed with me. He said:\n\n> You know, I can understand the frustration people have with [BLANK], but the\n> reason he has become unresponsive is not because of any malicious intent but\n> purely because he just got busy. We are all guilty of this.\n\nHe wasn’t wrong. Even though many were claiming this guy was fast becoming the\nson of the devil, such ramblings became overstated because (a) they were\nlargely expressed in private cabals of people who all agreed and (b) they had\nnever confronted [BLANK] with the issues and never got his side of the story.\nMovie fans may consider this all very reminiscent of the legend of the unseen\nKeyser Söze in _The_ _Usual Suspects_ : the legend was somewhat outstripping\nthe reality.\n\nThe obvious solution to this problem is to avoid these bottleneck issues in\nthe first place, but despite your best efforts, you are still likely to\nexperience some conflict as a result of these issues. Your primary role here\nis to investigate both sides of the story, provide feedback from everyone\ninvolved, and make necessary changes that are in the interests of the\ncommunity where required. Don’t allow members of your community to become\nKeyser Söze: break down the issue, understand all sides, and bring balance to\nthe discussion.\n\n### Tips for Avoiding Conflict\n\n  * Try to avoid bottlenecks set up by specific community members. If you experience them, unblock them as soon as possible.\n\n  * Dissuade personal comments and remarks if bottlenecks appear.\n\n  * Always consider whether bottlenecks have a malicious undertone. If they don’t, make that clear to detractors.\n\n  * Encourage public discussion of resource issues as opposed to private bickering sessions.\n\n## Lack of Justice\n\nThe final topic we should cover as a common source of conflict is the feeling\nthat previous conflict issues or problems were not handled in a manner that\nwas expected.\n\nConflict resolution is seen by many as a means of those with influence\ndelivering justice where it is genuinely required. When that justice is not\nexercised, a previously happy bunny can dramatically take on the guise of an\nextremely agitated and frustrated negativabunny. That’s right, folks, I just\nsaid “negativabunny.” Let’s see how much Google Juice we can squeeze out of\nthat word….\n\nClaims of ineffective conflict resolution and injustice are concerns that call\non you to commit a significant amount of your energy. While there are many\ncauses for conflict, your community will depend on its leaders to unblock\nconflict and restore order. When this happens, all conflict feels temporary\nand manageable. If your community loses faith in its leader’s ability to\nunblock and resolve these problems, it can feel as if the earth is shaking. It\ncan make the community feel like a lawless state in which agitation and\narguments reign supreme. This is obviously not a good position to be in.\n\nOne trait of a firm and clear governance structure is to allow assessments of\nthe very people who assess and handle conflicts. As an example, if you have a\nforums community governed by a Forums Council, that council should deal with\nconflict and unrest. If that council fails to reach a desirable outcome,\nconcerned community members can escalate the matter to the top-level Community\nCouncil that the Forums Council is subservient to.\n\nThe most important advice in avoiding this kind of criticism is always to\nengage in conflict resolution in a detailed and effective way. If this is a\npublic conflict, you should regularly engage with the community to show you\nare helping to deal with the situation. If the conflict is private, those who\nclaim that conflict was not resolved may simply be unaware that it was\nresolved. In many cases you can settle any concerns by dropping a quick email\nto the concerned members to let them know the situation was handled and\nresolved.\n\n### Tips for Avoiding Conflict\n\n  * Always deal with conflict. Never leave issues languishing or unresolved.\n\n  * In public conflict, ensure that you are seen to be acting. Provide input, feedback, and reassurance in public communication channels. Justice must be done and it must be _seen_ to be done.\n\n  * Always be responsive to concerns.\n\nPhysical Violence: Never Acceptable\n\nIt goes without saying that violence is never acceptable in your community.\nWhile it is rare, you must be prepared to take a zero-tolerance view in case\nit does happen. If someone is violent to another member, make it clear that\n(a) the attacker must leave the community, (b) you will inform the\nauthorities, and (c) the attacker will be able to rejoin the community after\nhe has cooled down and demonstrated that he will never again resort to such\nbehavior.\n\nInforming the authorities—which includes the police as well as the leaders of\ninstitutions you’re involved with, such as universities—is important for\nseveral reasons. First, violent people tend to escalate their behavior\nimperceptibly, and law enforcement can benefit from seeing patterns of\nescalating behavior so that they can ward off real danger. Second, you need to\nprotect your community against legal retaliation, because violent people often\nturn around and invent charges against their victims.\n\nAnother subtle point is that you consider very carefully whether you should\nmention that violence is never tolerated. For many, the merest mention of the\ntopic is so obvious that it can be interpreted as patronizing. This really\ndepends on your community. For example, it is undoubtedly going to be more\nacceptable to mention this topic in an urban regeneration community as opposed\nto a local neighborhood knitting group.\n\n# The Conflict Resolution Process\n\nNow that we have covered many of the warning signs and indicators of conflict,\nyou will hopefully have an opportunity to step in and deal with the issue\nbefore it really flares up. Even if you don’t manage to catch the warning\nsigns and step in, you can apply a similar process to managing the actual\nconflict.\n\nOf course, experts have proposed many, many different approaches to resolving\nconflict, and each situation is in itself unique. There is no cookie-cutter\napproach to dealing with conflict, and experience is the best judge of how to\nmove forward to resolve issues.\n\nWhat I am going to present here is a broad description of steps I generally\nuse to deal with contentious issues. These steps map out the primary elements\ninvolved in conflict resolution, and you can build on them to form your own\nstyle.\n\nInterestingly, while I was reading some of the many books about conflict\nresolution, I discovered a theory developed by Johnson & Johnson in 1994. I\nhave been living and practicing this approach to conflict resolution for years\nwithout realizing it had a name. I was all set to call it _Bacon’s Great\nConflict Resolution Theory_ when I discovered that those pesky Johnsons got in\nthere first.\n\nRegardless of who coined the theory, it is a practical, real, and directly\nusable approach for communities. Let’s take a look at Johnson & Johnson’s\napproach:\n\n  1. Collect data—Learn what the conflict is about, and develop an objective picture of all parties’ perspectives.\n\n  2. Probe—Ask open questions, listen, and engage with all parties to get the full story.\n\n  3. Save face—Work toward a winning resolution for everyone, and try to avoid embarrassing either party while always remaining objective and unemotional.\n\n  4. Discover common interests—Finding common interests and alliances will help find points of commonality beneath the conflict.\n\n  5. Reinforce—Where both parties share a perspective and agree, reinforce those perspectives, and particularly try to use data to back it up.\n\n  6. Negotiate—Start simple, trying to get both parties to agree on simple solutions, and then continue to build toward the common goals of both parties involved.\n\n  7. Solidify adjustments—Review, summarize, and confirm the areas in which both parties agree.\n\nEach step is performed one at a time. Naming and being conscious of these\nseven steps is useful for breaking down the process of conflict resolution. A\nlittle later we are going to walk through the resolution process and flesh out\nthese steps, but before we do that, let’s cover some general best-practice\nelements involved in the process.\n\n## The Role of a Facilitator\n\nWhen conflict occurs, the person who steps in to straighten out the issue has\na role similar to that of a judge or magistrate: to investigate the issue\nfairly and objectively and to reach a conclusion based on that fair and\nobjective judgment. This is the role of the _facilitator_ (also known as a\n_mediator_).\n\nA facilitator can’t be just anyone: she must secure the trust and confidence\nof the warring parties. The parties involved need to have faith that the\nfacilitator is going to take a fair, reasoned, and thorough approach to the\nconflict.\n\nThe probability that the conflict will be resolved is hugely dependent on this\nfaith. With this in mind, let’s spend some time looking at the profile of a\ngreat facilitator. This can give you some food for thought for your own role\nas a facilitator.\n\n### Be objective\n\nObjectivity is the foundation of all effective conflict resolution. As we\ndiscussed earlier, you need to build faith in the participants. To do this,\nyou need to build faith in the wider community that you can act in an entirely\nobjective fashion. This raises a difficult question, though: how do you\ndemonstrate objectivity in your community yet still offer opinions and\ndirection? To remain objective, do you need to never express your own opinion?\n\nNot at all. Objectivity does not spring from remaining aloof and above the\nfray, but in the way you engage in discussions and topics. This is all about\nhow you interact with the community. There are a few simple best practices\nthat can help communicate your objectivity to the community:\n\nBe honest\n\n    \n\nThere is no such thing as an objective but dishonest person. If your community\ndoesn’t trust you, they won’t believe in your ability to be objective. As\nsuch, be honest at all times, privately and publicly.\n\nAdmit when you are wrong\n\n    \n\nSometimes you are going to get it wrong…in public. Instead of denying any\nmistakes or withering behind a wall of silence, put your head above the pulpit\nand admit when you get it wrong. This is an extension of being honest, and\nyour community will respect you for it.\n\nDon’t wear the flame suit\n\n    \n\nEvery community has flame wars, that is, the arguments and disagreements that\nhappen on mailing lists, websites, blogs, and elsewhere. Don’t get involved.\nParticipating in the flame wars causes you harm in two ways. First, it raises\nthe temperature, because a well-respected community member has sought to weigh\nin, which drags the war out longer. Second, you don’t want a reputation for\ntaking part in online spats. Instead, you want a reputation for resolving them\nelegantly, and the place for elegance is not in a flame war.\n\nDon’t be afraid\n\n    \n\nAnother key component in building honesty with your community is to be honest\nand up-front when you disagree with someone. Every so often, you are going to\nneed to grab someone by the virtual collar and let him know what a destructive\nforce he is. Under the premise that your conduct is fair and balanced and that\nthe cause is reasonable, many community members will respect you for your\nfrankness. Just be careful not to veer into outright bollocking.\n\nAlways remember that building confidence in your objectivity works only if you\nare genuinely...objective. Objectivity doesn’t grow naturally in most people;\nyou need to consciously consider it and work on it.\n\nObjectivity and Annoying People\n\nThere are many ingredients that can risk or taint your objectivity. One of the\nmost significant is trying to remain objective when dealing with someone you\njust don’t like. Is it possible to be objective with someone who previously\nhumiliated you personally on his blog?\n\nIt is, but it requires careful and conscious consideration to ensure that you\nkeep on the straight and narrow and don’t let personal animosity blur your\nability to judge a situation fairly.\n\nThe solution to this is always to remember that the community is bigger than\nyou, that guy, or anyone else. Your ability to resolve conflict is something\nthat you are seeking to achieve for the community, and you need to keep its\nbest interests at heart. That could mean engaging respectfully with someone\nyou don’t like, even someone who was disrespectful to you.\n\nMy dad is a magistrate for a small county court in Northern England. Every\nmorning when he drives to the courthouse, he recites his oath of office to\nhimself: “I, John Richardson Bacon, swear by Almighty God that I will well and\ntruly serve our Sovereign Lady Queen Elizabeth the Second in the office of\nJustice of the Peace and I will do right by all manner of people after the\nlaws and usages of this realm without fear or favor, affection or ill will.”\nIt keeps his mind focused and keeps him objective.\n\n### Be positive\n\nConflict is not fun for anyone involved. A conflict situation is a mishmash of\ndifferent emotions from the different parties: anger, frustration, annoyance,\nself-reflection, embarrassment, and more. You should do your best to lighten\nthe atmosphere.\n\nBeing positive breaks down into several stances. First, you should be positive\nabout the ability to find a solution and an outcome. You need to give the\nparticipants in the conflict a positive impression that you can help, that you\nsympathize with their plight, and that you are going to help them to resolve\nthe problems.\n\nSecond, you should be positive about the wider community and the values behind\nthe project. As an example, whenever I have dealt with conflict situations in\nthe Ubuntu community, I have started by reminding participants why we are all\ninvolved. This positivity not only reminds the participants of the important\nwider picture, but also highlights a connection among the members of the\nconflict.\n\nFinally, there is huge value in just offering a generally positive and\nlighthearted approach to the situation. Having a generally positive demeanor,\nsmiling, and using upbeat language and subtle humor are all great methods of\nlightening the slightly cloudy atmosphere. Of course, there is a balance to be\nstruck here: don’t turn your role as facilitator into that of a stand-up\ncabaret comedian, but a few subtle, amusing references here and there will\nensure that everyone stays as positive as possible.\n\n### Be open\n\nI am going to let you in on a little secret. The word _open_ irritates me.\nWell, let me be clearer: the _overuse_ of the word _open_ irritates me, and in\nrecent years the word seems to be more prevalent than a furball in an animal\nshelter.\n\nWhen used within the context of conflict resolution, a valuable application of\nopenness is to seek equality with all participants in the conflict and thus\navoid cliques and in-jokes.\n\nSome years back, I was observing a friend of mine dealing with a conflict\nsituation who managed to violate this goal of equality and openness. He did\nthis by engaging differently with one of the participants: he knew that person\nmore personally and referred to various in-jokes and private references.\nRather unsurprisingly, the other person (who was just as bemused about the in-\njokes as I was) felt he never had a shot at an objective judgment. Don’t make\nthe same mistakes yourself.\n\nBe organized when you put your feet firmly into the shoes of a facilitator.\nMake sure to schedule calls and meetings at times you can adhere to; under no\ncircumstances should you simply skip meetings or stop responding to email.\nTimeliness is key.\n\nKeep Records\n\nAlways document what happens during conflict resolution. Get permission to\npreserve emails and other communications from all parties. Write down notes\nfrom sessions. In this way, you can refer back to previous communications when\npeople dispute the facts. Keeping records is also important because conflicts\nsometimes escalate to higher levels of the community, and members will want a\nhistory of what happened. Your conduct may even come under examination.\n\nWhile it is important to keep records, don’t be tempted to quote people out of\ncontext and use their words against them. This serves no purpose other than to\nmake people feel cornered. The records are instead a useful resource for\nkeeping track of the discussion as a whole.\n\n### Be clear\n\nThe most fundamental task when beginning conflict resolution is to communicate\nto all parties involved the expectations around your role as facilitator. The\nprimary expectations that I communicate are the following:\n\nSolutions are the goal\n\n    \n\nI am here to find a solution. There may be open wounds and cuts and bruises\nfrom previous exchanges, but we all need to find agreement on how to move\nforward.\n\nEvidence is central\n\n    \n\nThe process is going to concentrate on evidence as opposed to emotion. The\nfacts and reality of a situation are the guiding force, and emotion, carping,\ncomplaining, and assumed perception are not going to have a place in the\ndiscussion. This does not prevent an aggrieved party from asking for\ndiscipline toward someone who has violated the community’s standards regarding\nrespect, tolerance for others, and basic etiquette.\n\nConduct must be under control\n\n    \n\nAll discussion must be polite and respectful. You will not accept\ndisrespectful, threatening, or violent behavior.\n\nCompromise is the modus operandi\n\n    \n\nThe goal here is to find a solution that satisfies the majority of\nconsiderations in the main parties, but this solution may not be 100% of what\neveryone—or even anyone—wants.\n\nBy framing the conversation with these expectations on all sides, you will\nhelp get the conflict resolution wheels on the runway and prepare for takeoff.\n\n## Resolving the Conflict\n\nEarlier we talked about the seven-step Johnson & Johnson method for dealing\nwith conflict resolution. Over the following pages, we are going to explore\nthis process by breaking it into five parts:\n\n  1. Calm and reassure.\n\n  2. Get the facts.\n\n  3. Discuss.\n\n  4. Document.\n\n  5. Reflect and maintain.\n\nThese five parts will embody different steps of the Johnson & Johnson theory\noutlined earlier. In each part, we will discuss in detail the different\nconsiderations facing you. Each consideration is driven from countless\nconflict resolution incidents that I have been involved in over the years.\n\nTo make this content easier to understand, it is always good to apply the\ntheory to a real scenario. As such, on the following pages I will be\ndiscussing a real incident that occurred between two very prominent members of\na user group who were in fairly serious conflict over how to handle monetary\ndonations to the group. Naturally I have changed the names to protect the\ninnocent, but let me introduce you to the two characters:\n\n“Lee”\n\n    \n\nLee was loud, at times obnoxious and slightly egotistical, but despite these\ntraits clearly a sensitive guy. His commitment to the group was unwavering,\nand he was always coming up with ideas and creative methods of growing the\ngroup and doing exciting things. With this in mind, Lee was keen to set up a\nfacility to handle money (bank account, accounting, tax returns, etc.) and a\ngovernance body to handle this facility.\n\n“Alan”\n\n    \n\nAlan was quieter than Lee, but never afraid to voice his opinion. Alan was the\nkind of guy who would bear grudges, but would not engage in confrontation.\nAlan took an immediate and visceral dislike to the idea of a money-handling\nfacility. He was a firm believer in keeping the user group as simple as\npossible, and felt that Lee’s idea would create an unnecessary and complicated\nbureaucracy.\n\nWe will call this example “the fantastical user group debacle” and refer to it\nin each of the five parts. All set, friends? Let’s go....\n\n### Part 1: Calm and reassure\n\nBefore we begin the Johnson & Johnson items, the first step is to provide as\nmuch calm and reassurance as possible to the parties involved in the conflict.\nThe goal here is to set the tone for the conversation so that it begins\nwithout aggression and shouting. If you are receiving an aggressive tone, you\nshould first have a conversation with the person involved and make it clear\nthat you are there to help, but you can’t do anything until he calms down. Use\nreassuring and familiar language. For example, talk about “calm,” “resolving,”\n“peace,” and “community.” You absolutely cannot move forward effectively if an\naggressive tone is used, because it will instantly deter the opposite side of\nthe argument.\n\nIt is this very first step where you need to firmly assert your position as\nfacilitator. You need to reassure the factions and seal your commitment to\nfinding a solution, demonstrating absolute objectivity and focusing on\nevidence in the interest of finding a solution.\n\nYou need to strike a delicate tone here: sound reassuring and caring, but\ndon’t sound like a pushover. You need to ensure that both participants are\nclear that you will be firm and fair and that you will hear all sides of the\nstory.\n\n#### The fantastical user group debacle\n\nAlan and Lee clearly disagreed on how to handle money in the user group.\nAlthough this was the current topic, the initial email I had received\nsuggested this was merely the straw that broke the camel’s back. It was\nbecoming evident that the two just didn’t like each other very much and saw\nthe world very differently.\n\nBoth had exchanged testy words with each other, primarily over email, but they\nshared even more fervent words about each other with me. The language was very\nemotional: talk of “hating” each other, “refusing” certain ideas, and\n“demanding” various assurances.\n\nTo get this off on the right foot, I always prefer to discuss things on the\nphone. Both Alan and Lee were happy to talk, and I called both separately to\nbegin the discussion.\n\nIt was important that these were individual phone calls. At the beginning of\nthe calls, I received the expected vitriol toward the other, and I sought to\ncalm them down first. I then made it clear that I was here to help, to offer\nan objective investigation into what had happened to cause this rift and to\noffer my input. With so much anger on display, I made it very clear that I had\nmy own requirement before starting: a polite and reasoned tone. I stressed\nthat aggression and bickering had no place in the discussion. Both agreed, and\nwe were off to a good start.\n\nMy goal now was to help identify if there was a way these two passionate\ncommunity members could straighten out their differences or at least work\ncohesively in the same volunteer environment.\n\n### Part 2: Get the facts\n\n**J &J Elements Covered:**  \n---  \nCollect data  \nProbe  \n  \nThe goal of this phase is to assemble as much evidence about the situation as\nyou can. The real focus and priority here is to find unequivocal evidence,\nthat is, evidence of the situation that can be independently verified. Here we\nwant to separate out emotion and get to the heart of what really happened.\n\nYou should first speak to those on both sides of the conflict and ask them to\nprovide you with their stories. To engage in this discussion, you need to\ndecide how to communicate with them. I highly recommend doing this on the\nphone or via Voice over IP (such as Skype) if possible. A phone conversation\nis far more interpersonal and allows both parties to communicate more quickly\nthan over email or a chat medium such as IRC.\n\nWhen you gather this initial story, you should expect a fairly significant\namount of venting and emotion. Expect both parties to speak quickly, dart the\nfocus around different issues, and keep remembering details and frustrations\nthey had previously forgotten to mention in the conversation. While you have\nthis conversation, bear a few things in mind:\n\nListen\n\n    \n\nTake your time and listen to the person carefully. Give her a chance to speak,\nget her frustrations off her chest, and provide you with as much data as\npossible.\n\nAsk questions\n\n    \n\nStart by asking the person to start at the beginning, walk her through what\nhappened, and ask lots of questions about each step in the timeline. If you\nare uncertain about something, don’t be afraid to ask. Remember, you want to\ngather as much data as possible.\n\nDon’t offer opinion\n\n    \n\nTry your best to not offer an opinion or emotional reaction to what the person\ntells you. Even if you strongly agree or disagree with her sentiment, you\nshould try to just gather the facts as best you can.\n\nMake notes\n\n    \n\nAlways have a pen and paper (or text editor) ready before you have the\nconversation. Note the timeline, the issues, and other elements of the story.\n\nAfter this initial conversation, you should have a firm idea of the involved\nparties’ primary problems and concerns. At the end of the conversation you\nshould ask for one more thing: ask both parties independently to send you an\nemail with as much evidence and details that illustrate their concerns as\npossible.\n\nThe next step is to reenact a childhood dream of mine that has been left\ndormant for years: to assume the investigative role of Columbo. That’s right,\nfolks, it’s time to don the long mac, chomp on the somewhat dog-eared cigar,\nand begin hunting for additional third-party evidence. Here you want to\naugment the content submitted from the (naturally biased) participants of the\nconflict and find some other data that can help you figure out where things\nstand.\n\nTo do this, you need to know where to look. Some of these may apply to your\ncommunity:\n\nPublic communication channels\n\n    \n\nLook for public discussion on mailing lists, in logged IRC channels, on social\nnetworking websites, and elsewhere.\n\nHooks\n\n    \n\nEarlier in the book, when we explored how to measure community, we talked\nabout the hooks that can be used to extract meaningful data about your\ncommunity. Think about which hooks could be useful to gather relevant data. As\nan example, if the conflict is surrounding a specific person screwing up bug\nreports, look into the bug tracker and make a note of the activity that\noccurred there.\n\nContent\n\n    \n\nTake a look at blogs, blog comments, articles, and other written material that\nmay be relevant to the topic. There may even be evidence lurking in podcasts,\nonline videos, and elsewhere.\n\nWhen you have gathered as much evidence as you can find, you now have to\nconsider whether you need third-party opinions. If the conflict concerns the\nconduct of people in the community, or it affects the wider community or other\npublic issues, you may want to gather some feedback.\n\nThere are two approaches to soliciting feedback, both of which have pros and\ncons. First, you could target certain people for their opinions on the issue.\nThe benefit of this is that you can specifically target people who you know to\nbe objective and unbiased on the issue. The downside is that you get a limited\nspread of knowledge that may not accurately reflect the situation.\n\nThe second approach is to place a call for more data from the general\ncommunity. The pros of this approach are that it is open and inclusive to the\nwider community, but it does have problems: (a) it raises the profile of the\nproblem, which is typically the opposite of what you want, and (b) it can\nbring out all manner of crazies.\n\nI recommend you take the former approach, but ensure that you have a wide\nrange of opinion and still maintain a strong sense of objectivity around the\ninformation that you receive.\n\nAlways Maintain Privacy\n\nWhen soliciting opinions about a conflict issue, you should do your best to\nobscure the identities of those from whom you solicit private opinions.\n\nWhen you have solicited your evidence, input, and general feedback on the\nconflict, you will have enough material to begin forming a position on what\nhas happened. Although you have to remember the possibility of bias in each\npiece of evidence and opinion, it is likely that you are beginning to get a\nbroadly accurate idea of what has happened and what went wrong.\n\nYou now need to reconcile this evidence and input with the goals, values, and\nperspectives of the community. Have any of the actions of those involved\nfallen outside the culture of your community? Is there any evidence of\npersonal benefit being put forward as the best interests of the community?\n\nNow is the time to review the situation and adopt your unbiased perspective to\ndraw a conclusion on what has happened. With almost every conflict situation,\nthe fault will lie with both parties in different areas. You should note how\neach party could have handled the situation better, and if and when they acted\noutside the reasonable (and preferably documented) expectations of the\ncommunity.\n\n#### The fantastical user group debacle\n\nEarlier I mentioned that I had initial phone calls with Alan and Lee to calm\ntheir frustrations. I used my phone calls partly to gather some initial\nfeedback on what the primary issues were (the donation system being one of\nthem) and their respective viewpoints.\n\nAlan gave me a patchwork of his problems with Lee and Lee’s perspective, a\nstream of consciousness that came flooding toward me in one big, disorganized\nmess of thoughts. I noted everything he said, and regularly repeated key\nproblems that he outlined to ensure that we were both clear on what he was\nsaying.\n\nI then did the same for Lee. This time, an even more disorganized set of\nthoughts came flying in my general direction. Lee was less angry at Alan, but\nhe was clearly frustrated with the situation and was growing impatient.\n\nBecause the environment that encased these issues was a user group, I started\ndoing some third-party research. I looked into their mailing list, lingered on\ntheir IRC channel, and had a few private one-on-one conversations with people\nwhom I knew to be objective in that community. As I received more evidence, a\npattern was forming: Lee’s requests were increasingly erratic, demanding, and\npersonally driven. It seemed that Lee not only wanted a governed body to cover\nhow money was handled, but he also wanted almost absolute control himself.\nReports of Lee’s demanding nature and self-perception of leadership was\nconcerning other group members. Although it was clear he was not seeking to\nmake money from the group, there was maybe a little too much desire for power\nin his plan. My hunch was that Lee’s desire for power was an insecurity caused\nby the rift between him and Alan, another very prominent community member.\n\nAt this point in the process, I was faced with two challenges. First, there\nwere the specific relationship problems between Lee and Alan, but there was\nalso the wider concern in the community surrounding Lee’s conduct and\nleadership efforts. My feeling was that if I could reduce the venom between\nAlan and Lee, this would (a) bring less of their personal anger to general\ncommunity meetings, (b) drive toward a solution on the money-handling issue,\nand (c) inspire Lee to become more reasonable and less power-hungry.\n\n### Part 3: Discuss\n\n**J &J Elements Covered:**  \n---  \nSave face  \nDiscover common interests  \nReinforce  \nNegotiate  \n  \nThe next step is to engage in a conversation with both parties that nudges\nthem toward a conclusion. The goals of this part are to discuss the issues,\nhear all sides together, and then find solutions and consensus in areas where\nboth sides agree. This is all about searching through the chaotic claims and\nmemories for patterns where you can lay down an eventual consensus. By finding\nthese patterns, you can make progress toward a general agreement and also\nbuild a more positive atmosphere around shared values as opposed to differing\nones.\n\nThe first step is to schedule the discussion. If the conflict is between two\nspecific people, the best medium for discussion is typically a conference\ncall. This can happen on a range of online telephony services (such as Skype)\nor by using a conventional telephone conference call service. Many\nconventional handsets even support three-way conversations at no extra cost.\n\nIf the conflict is public and part of a team or group, schedule a public\nmeeting. I have found the most suitable medium for this to be IRC. It allows\npeople to share thoughts quickly so long as they can all get online at a\nspecific time.\n\nYour choice of medium is heavily dependent on what is comfortable for your\ncommunity. The most important factor is that it is real-time: the discussion\nneeds the immediate give and take of a meeting of minds. Email and forums are\nfine for discussing general issues of the conflict, but the resolution really\nneeds to happen in real time.\n\nThe most important points about scheduling a public meeting are that it should\n(a) be in a neutral or, if suitable, public place and (b) at a time that is\nconvenient for the primary stakeholders in the conflict. What you want to\navoid is scheduling a meeting when one of the primary participants has to get\nout of bed at 3 a.m. to take part in the discussion. That person will\ninvariably be a little grumpier than normal (shocking, I know!), and said\ngrumpiness will infect the discussion and complicate matters.\n\n### Note\n\nFace-to-face meetings for conflict resolution are sometimes possible, and\nwhile they are valuable in many instances, I generally recommend against them.\nBody language plays a huge role in face-to-face conflict resolution and can\ndistract the participants from the issues as well as provide a more\nintimidating environment in which participants may struggle to find consensus.\n\nWhether public or private, you should keep the length of the meeting to a set\namount of time (one hour is usually advisable). There are a few reasons for\nthis.\n\nFirst, if you have an open-ended meeting, it will go on for a _long_ time and\nsome of the participants will grow tired of the meeting before others, causing\nfrustration. Second, a set amount of time will keep everyone focused on the\ndetails and mitigate inane rambling, diatribes, and monologues, which are\nalways common in these kinds of discussions. Finally, you need to think of\nyour own sanity, too: dealing with a juicy three-hour chunk of conflict\nresolution can drive you potty. If you break down the discussion into\nmanageable chunks, it will mean that the members of the discussion are always\nfresh and so are you.\n\nWith the meeting scheduled and everyone either on the line or in the channel,\nyou can begin the discussion. Although there is no fixed formula for handling\nthese contentious topics, we will now discuss a broad template that can get\nyou started.\n\nFirst, introduce the conversation. Say who you are and the role you are\nplaying; state the purpose of your meeting; and reiterate the values, goals,\nand bigger picture of the community. Make it clear that you are here to help\nand will be taking an objective role in discussing all the issues involved.\n\nNext, clarify the ground rules for the discussion. Make it clear that the\ndiscussion needs to remain polite and honest and that everyone should be\ndriving toward a conclusion. Also make it clear that while everyone involved\ncannot fix the problems of the past, you can work together to produce a better\nfuture that avoids these issues. Reinforce that to achieve this better future\nit will require the commitment of everyone in the meeting to move toward a\nsolution. Ask everyone to enter the discussion with an open mind to finding\nthis solution.\n\nNow it is time to get to the meat of the conflict resolution process. Friends,\nthis is where the action really happens. Discuss the different issues openly\nand objectively, seek additional input, and focus on how you can make small\nagreements here and there. Remember that the goal here is to achieve lots of\nlittle victories.\n\nTry to reframe the conversation away from what the participants disagree on\nand toward what they agree on. Cover each issue one at a time and slowly build\nmore and more little agreements. When you reach a consensus on a specific\ntopic, make it clear that you are making progress (but don’t be tacky when\ncelebrating this progress).\n\nThroughout the meeting, take plenty of notes and be careful to jot down areas\nin which you reach consensus. These notes should preferably be public so that\nthere can be agreement on the wording: the devil is always in the details.\nMake sure everyone understands the consensus, as sometimes subtle differences\nin interpretation can blow up later in the discussion. As such, when an\nagreement is made, repeat it and ensure that you get a clear consensus from\neveryone. The devil is in the details here, too: when you repeat what you\nunderstand as the agreed-upon view, one of the members of the discussion is\nlikely to disagree with a certain choice of words or require clarification. As\nsuch, adjust your language until everyone is happy.\n\nWhen you reach the end of your time slot, you should thank all of those\ninvolved for their contributions, express pride that you all made progress,\nand repeat the areas in which you reached consensus. If you didn’t reach\nconsensus on anything, indicate that you still made progress and that you are\nconfident that more progress will be made in the next meeting. You should\nnever end a meeting without scheduling the next one: this will ensure that the\nissue has a sense of continuity.\n\n#### The fantastical user group debacle\n\nTo resolve the conflict between Alan and Lee, I scheduled a conference call to\nbring them together and discuss their different opinions. Fortunately, both\nwere based in the same time zone, so I scheduled a call that was mutually\nconvenient for them. Before the call began, I refreshed my memory of the\nevidence using the notes that I had gathered. My goal in the call was to find\nas much consensus as possible, particularly around the money-handling issue.\nWhile it was the group’s decision as a whole about how they handle donations,\nI was keen to reduce the vitriol from the Lee and Alan relationship because\nthis would then help the discussion with the rest of the group to be less\nemotional.\n\nWhen the call began, I largely followed the steps I outlined on the previous\nfew pages. I introduced myself and my involvement, made it clear that reasoned\nand polite discussion was required in the call, and started covering each\nissue one by one. I started with general attitudes toward funding resources in\nthe group. The first piece of consensus we achieved was that the group did\nwant to conduct activities that required equipment and therefore an outlay of\nmoney. This was a step forward: both Alan and Lee agreed that the need to\nhandle money in some way was required.\n\nThe next part of the discussion was to cover typical activities requiring\nmoney. Was this a small amount of money for printing and CD duplication, or\nwas it a larger expense for equipment and travel? Consensus struck again with\nagreement that costs would be for small to medium-size expenses, the most\ncostly being a few nights in a hotel and a train ticket.\n\nAt this point in the discussion, there was a general atmosphere of agreement\nin the call. Both Alan and Lee were loosening up and more pleasant with each\nother, and the growing sense of agreement was having an impact. As the call\nprogressed, we edged further and further toward agreement on a series of\ndifferent issues. After a few more small steps forward, the time was up. I\nreiterated our progress and we all agreed to have a wider meeting on the\nmoney-handling topic with the community.\n\nA week later, the community meeting kicked off, and I shared some of the\nagreements that Alan and Lee had formed. We then moved forward to discuss how\ndonations would be handled, and the community agreed on PayPal. The next step\nwas to discuss the crux of the issue: who would look after the money. Alan and\nLee each expressed their perspectives in turn and other community members\nweighed in. A number of community members expressed concern over a full\ngovernance solution to handling money, and naturally Alan reiterated his views\non the matter while Lee and some others provided their opposing views.\n\nTo find a middle ground, I proposed that instead of a full governing body to\nlook after the money, Lee (who had been the primary champion of a money\nmanagement facility in the group) would handle the funds but provide open\naccounting of the funds. I also recommended regular meetings with the group\nabout how the money was being handled. Furthermore, I offered Lee the task of\ninvestigating what we would need to do to satisfy the local tax requirements.\n\nThe group unilaterally agreed. Bingo! This tentative and fragile agreement was\nthe victory that we could build on to later reach a firmer sense of agreement\nand consensus. The next step was to document the extent of this agreement so\nthat everyone would be (literally) on the same page.\n\n### Part 4: Document\n\n**J &J Elements Covered:**  \n---  \nSolidify adjustments  \n  \nAs you proceed through your negotiations in the previous part, you should\ndocument each agreement in detail and ensure that both parties agree to what\nyou have documented. It is this agreed-upon document that is going to form the\nbasis of cooperation between the two parties in the future.\n\nWith this document, once again the devil is in the details. Ensure that you\nuse precise, descriptive language and try not to use conflated or ambiguous\nwords. This document should be unsexy but accurate: its purpose is not to\nenthuse or inspire, but to accurately describe the agreement in all of its\nboringly descriptive and unexciting glory.\n\nAs you build up this document, check in formally with each party to gain\nagreement on each addition. By the end of the discussions, when you have\nconsensus on all major areas, the document should not be a surprise to anyone.\n\n#### The fantastical user group debacle\n\nIn the case of our friends Alan and Lee, I spent a total of three calls with\nthem fleshing out a conclusion to the conflict. In each call we made progress,\nand with each agreement I noted the precise results in a document we all\nshared. After each meeting, I emailed them with a summary of what we agreed\nand the total set of agreements. The act of documenting our progress and\nsharing it fostered a real sense of progress.\n\n### Part 5: Reflect and maintain\n\nThe final part of the conflict resolution process is twofold: to maintain\nprogress on the agreed-upon outcomes and to encourage a general sense of\npersonal development in the members of the conflict.\n\nThe former goal is an exercise in keeping your wheels on the road. Just\nbecause you have a set of written, agreed-upon outcomes doesn’t mean anyone is\ngoing to stick with them. Don’t hold the members’ hands as they execute the\noutcomes, but check in every so often and ensure that everything is running\nsmoothly. This can often be as simple as a quick email to each party to see\nhow things are going. To ensure that you don’t forget, it’s often useful to\nput it in your calendar for a few weeks’ time.\n\nThe second element is subtle yet important. In many cases of conflict, the\nparticipants often become very reflective at a later date. Many will review\ntheir actions and their conduct, and while they will remain resolute in some\nof their opinions, they may also express regret at how they handled certain\nsituations.\n\nThese reflective lessons are valuable, and your community needs reinforcement\nwhen they happen. To see why, think back to when you have made your own\nreflections on your life. When someone has been by your side to cheer you on,\nit gives you much more determination to be consistent in the change. Because\nyou are the person who helped get these two parties through the conflict, they\nwill be looking to you for guidance and validation.\n\nOffering this validation is something worth doing, but it must be done very\ncarefully. There is a fine line between validating and patronizing. Help to\nvalidate them, but listen carefully to the feelings they express, and don’t\nrush. Get it right, and not only have you unblocked the conflict but you have\nhelped to improve someone’s life inside and outside your community.\n\n#### The fantastical user group debacle\n\nAfter finishing the conflict negotiation with Alan, Lee, and the wider group,\nI stayed in regular touch with everyone, and I am still in touch with them\ntoday. I have chatted informally with them on IRC and on the phone—and while\nblowing the froth off a few cold ones—and have helped to reinforce their\ngrowth. While I’ve helped them, they have also helped me—a lot. The reason I\npicked their story for this example is no coincidence: it is their conflict\nthat helped me to really understand the topic better—but more importantly, to\nunderstand them better. At its heart, conflict is about understanding people\nand helping them to understand each other, and by exploring and learning some\nof these approaches, sooner or later you will have your own Alan and Lee story\nto take lessons from.\n\n# Dealing with Burnout\n\nSo far in this chapter we have explored the importance of conflict, the\ndifferent elements of the conflict resolution process, and how to step through\nit. The majority of this content can be applied when people fall out, get\nfrustrated, get out of bed on the wrong side, and otherwise end up in the\nditch. Unfortunately, there is one other element in life that specifically\nfalls into the “not fun” category: _burnout_.\n\n### Note\n\nAlthough I have always dreamed that when someone shouts, “Is there a doctor on\nthe plane?” I can step up to the plate, unfortunately, I am not a doctor, and\nyou should remember this as you read this section. My carefully scrawled and\nspellchecked words are no replacement for the opinion of a medical\nprofessional. If you are worried about burnout, see your doctor and get some\nadvice.\n\nBurnout is a problem that affects all walks of life, all people, and all\nprofessions. As such, it is a problem that affects all communities, and yours\nis no different. Burnout refers to long-term exhaustion that typically causes\nlack of interest and focus. Unfortunately, it can be devilishly difficult to\nspot and prevent in your community.\n\nBurnout appears as a series of often subtle changes in personality,\nperspective, values, and behavior in the sufferer. As these changes progress,\nit can be difficult to identify that members are suffering from burnout.\nUnfortunately, burnout often is misdiagnosed as irrationality, short\ntemperament, unusual and strange behavior, lack of tolerance, or for the\nladies out there, accusations of “the wrong time of the month.”\n\nWhile it is difficult to identify categorically, fortunately there is some\ncompelling research that was first published in the June/July 2006 issue of\n_Scientific American_ in an article called “Burned Out.” It presented the\nfindings of two psychologists, Herbert Freudenberger and Gail North, and their\n_Burnout Cycle_. The cycle is composed of 12 phases that outline the\nprogressively serious steps that are part of burnout.\n\nThese steps don’t necessarily happen in a sequential order (it can vary from\nperson to person), and some sufferers will skip some of the steps whereas\nothers will dwell longer on them. These steps offer an interesting list of\nwarning signs for potential burnout victims. Let’s take a look at them:\n\n  1. A compulsion to prove oneself\n\nOften burnout is triggered by an obsessive commitment to prove yourself. This\ndesire is founded in demonstrating to your colleagues and particularly\nyourself that you can knock the ball out of the park.\n\n  2. Working harder\n\nTo knock the aforementioned ball out of the aforementioned park, hard work is\nneeded. This is manifested in long days, longer nights, and an inability to\nswitch off results.\n\n  3. Neglecting one’s own needs\n\nIn this stage, simple pleasures such as sleeping, eating, socializing with\nfriends, and watching _Seinfeld_ are seen as just that: pleasures, and as\nsuch, a distraction from work. (I am not sure if there is a proven connection\nbetween a lack of _Seinfeld_ and burnout, but there should be.)\n\n  4. Displacement of conflicts\n\nIn this stage, you don’t really understand the problems that you have. If they\nlead to discomfort or even panic, the victim dismisses the impressions because\nthey feel threatening.\n\n  5. Revision of values\n\nIn this phase, the obsession and focus of work means that traditional values\nsuch as friends or hobbies are dismissed, rejected, and pushed aside. Here\nyour only evaluation of success is being good at your job.\n\n  6. Denial of emerging problems\n\nIn this phase, cynicism, intolerance, and aggression raise their ugly heads.\nColleagues are dismissed as idiots. Your increasing problems are blamed on\nlack of time, incompetent coworkers, and unfair workloads.\n\n  7. Withdrawal\n\nYou reduce your social interaction and contacts to a minimum and dial up your\nwork to 11. You may start relieving the stress by boozing more often during\nthe week or possibly even resorting to drugs. Whatever your choice of\nsubstance, you appear to be indulging in it a little more than usual—and\ndangerously so.\n\n  8. Obvious behavioral changes\n\nYour strange and erratic behavior is obvious to your friends, family, and\ncolleagues. You are not yourself, and your nearest and dearest can see it a\nmile off.\n\n  9. Depersonalization\n\nAt this point you feel like you offer no value to the world, and lack\nconfidence in what you feel you could once do. Your life feels like one long\nseries of mechanical and emotionless functions.\n\n  10. Inner emptiness\n\nYou feel an expressed sense of emptiness. You resort more to booze or drugs or\npossibly find relief in overeating, strange and exaggerated sexual behavior,\nor other activities.\n\n  11. Depression\n\nHere you feel hopeless, lost, and exhausted, and see little in the way of rays\nof light for the future.\n\n  12. Burnout syndrome\n\nAt this, the most serious level, you feel suicidal and desperate for a way\nout. You are on the verge of mental and physical collapse and need medical\nsupport and attention.\n\nWow, by the end of reading that lot you may want to go and pet a small animal,\nwatch _The Sound of Music_ , or sniff a rose. It is pretty frightening stuff,\nand unfortunately it appears to be prevalent.\n\nSome of you will have read the list and identified with many of these steps,\nwhereas others of you will be identifying friends, family, or colleagues who\nmay have exhibited some of the steps. I have met and known people who have\nexhibited almost all the behaviors described in these steps, and when serious\nburnout takes its grip, it can destroy families, careers, and many other\naspects of life.\n\n## Detecting and Treating Burnout\n\nWith the risks evident in the list of symptoms, you are sure to be wondering\nwhat is the best approach to manage this risk. Is there a way to identify and\nreact to burnout in your community?\n\nThis is something I have participated in during various discussion sessions at\ndifferent conferences. Unfortunately, there is no recipe or secret formula for\ndealing with burnout in a community. The best solution is to subscribe to one\nsimple philosophy that has helped people deal with complex life changes and\ndecisions for years:\n\nI got your back, dude.  \n---  \n  \nAlthough it may seem outrageously simple, the easiest and most applicable\nmethod is to first develop a nose for symptoms and to then extend a personal\nhand of friendship to the sufferer. Having that sense of companionship through\na tough time can really help with burnout.\n\nTo detect the symptoms you should first read, reread, and then read again the\n12 items in the Burnout Cycle. These items provide a core set of knowledge for\nunderstanding the nature of burnout. You should then keep a general eye out\nfor these symptoms in your community. Specifically look for and be conscious\nof changes in behavior. If someone just “doesn’t seem herself,” she may be\ngetting bitten by burnout. It is these changes in behavior that are the\ntypical signs.\n\nIf you suspect that someone is getting burned out, just strike up a personal\nconversation and be entirely frank. Tell the person you noticed she has been a\nlittle different recently and that you are concerned. Ask her if she is OK,\nand ask if there is anything you can help with. In many cases the person will\ntell you what is on her mind, what is stressing her out, and any problems she\nappears to be having.\n\nWith overwork as a common cause of burnout, you should also ask how she is\ncoping with her workload and if there is anything you can do to ease it. This\noffer of help in itself can be a stress reliever—it is a validation that\nsomeone is there to help her get through her TODO list.\n\n### Required rest and relaxation\n\nOne of the most effective methods of shackling up burnout is to get away from\nthings and unwind. It is amazing how a small vacation can help someone\ndecompress.\n\nThis happened to me when I felt I was burning out. I felt like I wasn’t myself\nand could feel how stressed and anxious I was. To deal with this, I went to\nIreland for a long weekend to visit a friend. It is incredible how those few\ndays with a friendly face, getting out in the countryside, having a few\ndrinks, and getting away from a computer helped.\n\nIf you suspect you or someone else is burning out, tell him to do the same and\nget away for a few days. He will almost certainly claim he can’t or doesn’t\nneed to, but stand firm: it is for his own good, and he will thank you for it.\n\nVolunteerism Escapes Nothing\n\nWhen on the subject of communities and stress, looks can be deceiving.\nAlthough most communities are firmly wedged in the volunteer category, that\ndoesn’t mean their participants don’t develop, feel, and react to stress. The\nlack of compulsion behind volunteers’ involvement and contribution does not\nmean volunteers who feel stress can just go and do something else. People grow\nattached to communities, their ethos, and their sense of family. The\ninvolvement may not be contractually required, but it is often emotionally\nrequired inside the mind of the contributor.\n\n## Work/Life Balance\n\nAt the center of the somewhat unpleasant universe that is burnout is the\nproblem of balance. Although there is little concrete scientific evidence to\ndetermine who burnout is more likely to pick on, mere observational evidence\nsuggests that technical folks, musicians, counselors, authors, and teachers\nhave a higher than normal risk of reserving a place on the dreaded Burnout\nCycle.\n\nBalance is a surprisingly complicated goal for many to achieve, particularly\nif your community is an online, Internet-based community. Years ago it was\neasier to get balance: you simply switched off your computer and went and\nlived the parts of your life that didn’t involve a mouse and a keyboard. As\nthe Internet has steamed into our lives more and more, the amount of time in\nour lives that doesn’t involve said mouse and keyboard is being reduced.\n\nIn addition to the familiar tools of the workplace, such as email, office\nsuites, web browsers, and accounting packages, we now have social networking\nwebsites such as Facebook and MySpace; blogging sites such as Blogger and\n[Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com); microblogging with Twitter and\nidenti.ca; and online chat services such as Skype, Google GChat, MSN, Yahoo!\nIM, and AIM. Let’s also not forget the entertainment on the Web: countless\nwebsites, animations, videos, and articles are all there to attract us to the\ncomputer. We can then seal the deal with the myriad other online facilities\nsuch as Internet banking, review websites, mapping tools, online shopping,\ngames, and more.\n\nIt is easy to see how this merry band of pixelated distractions can take Ctrl,\nand it is not entirely unsurprising that someone could spend a whole day and\nmost of an evening in front of a computer. This is itself not exactly healthy:\ncomputers are great, but everyone should spend some time away from them to\ndecompress, get some fresh air, and energize other attributes of the human\ncondition, such as going out, playing sports, spending time with friends,\nembracing a loved one, and other fun things that don’t involve staring\nintently at a screen.\n\n### Addiction\n\nThe problem is that when the rest of your life is wrapped with window borders,\nyou are only ever a click away from either work or other commitments, such as\ncommunity. While we want to encourage our community members to throw\nthemselves into our goals and enjoy every moment of it, it is important to\nensure that in the process of doing so they don’t ignore and neglect other\nparts of their lives.\n\nAddiction has affected many online communities: there are contributors and\nmembers who spend every conceivable moment of their lives embedded in the\ncommunity. This can be seen everywhere. I know of many people today who appear\nto be constantly online at all times of the day, always responsive to chat\nmessages and queries and seemingly never away from their screens.\n\nFor many this is an agreeable choice that they can step away from when needed.\nMany people can wake up at 7 a.m., work all day, spend the entire evening in\nfront of the computer in pursuits of their own, head to bed at 1 a.m. or 2\na.m., and spend a valuable six hours sleeping, only to wake up and repeat.\nThat may be OK because these people can easily go away for a weekend, spend a\nfew evenings doing something else, and go on vacation without getting jittery.\nFor some, though, even spending one evening—let alone a whole weekend!—away\nfrom their familiar screen can seem like too much. In these cases we are\nseeing strong signs of _addiction_.\n\nYou should be very cautious of addiction: it is never healthy in anyone.\nUnfortunately, the nature of the addicted beast typically means these people\nare in a state of denial about their condition. Just as with alcohol,\ncigarettes, or gambling, claims of “I could stop if I wanted to” are often\nthrown in the general direction of naysayers, but these claims are rarely, if\never, tested.\n\nThe reason for your caution is that at some point an addicted member _will_\nburn out. It may take longer than expected, but when it does, it could have\ncatastrophic results. Keep an eye on your community members and how much they\nare online: if it feels like too much, a quick and sensitive word in their ear\ncan help them get away for a few days.\n\n# Handling Absence\n\nOne of the most challenging things to deal with in a community is when your\ncommunity members leave. Of course, there are many reasons why people may\nleave, but they can be broadly divided into three categories:\n\nPlanned\n\n    \n\nPlanned absences are when a community member provides notice that she either\nwill be away for a period of time or is leaving for good. This can include\ngoing on vacation, having children, taking some time away from the community\nto decompress, and so on.\n\nGradual\n\n    \n\nSome community members will gradually reduce their involvement as time goes on\nwithout any notice or intent to give notice. This can often happen when people\nsimply get busy with other things and their availability is reduced, as well\nas when a member doesn’t enjoy the community as much as he did, yet doesn’t\nwant to commit to leaving.\n\nAbrupt\n\n    \n\nSometimes a community member will just vanish. This can be caused by a new\nrelationship (someone falls head over heels in love and vanishes for a while\nto live his life to the soundtrack of _Dirty Dancing_), a blowout with someone\nin the community, or an illness; unfortunately, sometimes people vanish for\nunknown reasons.\n\nIn your community you always want to strive to be able to plan for absence and\nidentify ways to fill in the gaps where possible. As such, you should always\nencourage a culture in which your community members inform one another when\nthey are going away for a while (or for good). You should also encourage a\nculture of leaders stepping down gracefully (this is something we have done in\nUbuntu as part of our Code of Conduct, and it has worked well).\n\nIn cases when an absence is abrupt and unexpected, your first goal is to\nensure that the community member is OK. Check in with him and see if there are\nany problems you can help to resolve. If it looks like he will be coming back,\ntry to get an estimate of how long he will be gone and use this as a means to\nfind someone to cover his work while he is away. If he doesn’t plan to come\nback you should build some buzz to find a replacement for his role in the\ncommunity.\n\n# Handling Bereavement\n\nThe death of a community member can be a challenging and difficult time. It\ncan also be a surprisingly heartwarming time, as your community pulls together\nlike a family to console and support one another.\n\nIn 2011, a member of the Ubuntu community died; he was called Andre. He was a\nprominent and active member of the Brazilian community and was a popular and\nwell-loved friend to those who knew him. Unfortunately, Andre had been\nsuffering from some health issues for some time, and many people didn’t know\nabout this as he kept these challenges to himself. He died the week of one of\nour Ubuntu Developer Summits.\n\nI had not handled the death of a community member before. I made sure to mark\nhis memory and his wonderful contributions to our community, but to also not\ntell people how they should grieve; I believe grief is a very personal\njourney. To find this balance I decided to hold a minute of silence in the\nclosing ceremony of the summit and put up a big picture of Andre. Another\nmember of the community also organized a book so that people could write their\ncondolences and memories for Andre’s family.\n\nAlthough this was a sad time, the way the community came together to support\none another, celebrate Andre’s memory, and be there for one another as a\nfamily was a memorable and warming experience. My advice, if you need to\nhandle a similar situation, is to be respectful in marking the memory of the\nmember who passed while also being respectful of the different ways in which\npeople grieve.\n\n# Summary\n\nThroughout this chapter, we have explored some of the darker alleys of\ncommunity leadership. While working with community is an unbridled pleasure\nand joy 90% of the time, the remaining 10% of life can be the most difficult\nand sensitive to deal with. This 10% can also bring the most stress to your\ntable and is the most likely cause of uncertainty in how to move forward.\n\nThe most important thing to remember through all of this is that conflict and\nits associated resolution is not new. It is as old as the world itself, and\ncountless generations of people just like you have learned how to deal with\ncontentious issues before you. While the topics and advice covered in this\nchapter will get you off to a great start, you should do your best to find a\nmentor. Find someone who has been around these parts before, and ask her if\nshe will advise you from time to time about where to go when faced with a fork\nin the road. Accept that the first few times you mediate, you’ll make\nmistakes—and don’t feel bad if the outcome is less successful than you had\nhoped.\n\nGreat community resolution is based on experience. The advice throughout this\nchapter, combined with the advice from a mentor and augmented with your own\ngrowing body of knowledge, will combine to help you handle these testing\nsituations elegantly, and before long you will become the mentor to others.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n# Chapter 12. Creating and Running Events\n\n“The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical\nsubstances; if there is any reaction, both are transformed.”\n\n—Carl Gustav Jung\n\nOn July 3, 2001, my friend Lee Jordan and I boarded the train from\nWolverhampton to London. It was early, we had barely slept the previous night,\nand we should have been grumpy. We were not, though. We were on our way to the\nLinux Expo at the Olympia Exhibition Hall to run an exhibition stand for the\nKDE project, and we were jazzed up.\n\nWe’d spent two weeks building up to the event, gathering t-shirts, posters,\nfliers, demonstration machines, leaflets, customized name badges, and more. I\nwas determined to make sure that anyone and everyone who walked past our 6′ ×\n4′ booth would leave with a memory. Of course, I hoped this memory would be of\nthe incredible technology behind the KDE desktop as opposed to the tired-\nlooking, long-haired 22-year-old with a guitar pick on a chain around his\nneck.\n\nWe got far more than we bargained for. The booth was well received and was in\nitself a learning experience. We got to understand expectations around KDE far\nbetter, got to show off and educate people about the project, and met a number\nof new contacts. In addition to this, we met many members from elsewhere in\nthe open source community. We also got to meet a range of open source\ncompanies and publishers (in fact, it was at that show where I scored my first\nwriting gig). Finally, while at a social event at a nearby pub, I found myself\nin between Alan Cox and Jon “maddog” Hall, two legends in our community.\n\nAfterward, tired and weary, Lee and I dragged ourselves back to Euston\nStation, boarded our train, and for the first time in three days, sat down and\nbreathed.\n\nMy body was utterly exhausted, but my mind was exhilarated. I had just\nexperienced a roller coaster of thrills. I had traveled to a place I was\nunfamiliar with. I represented a community I was proud of, met people I had\nonly chatted with online, shook the hands of two of my open source heroes, and\neven managed to score the chance to get an article printed in a magazine. In\nthe same way my very first encounter with community way back in [Chapter\n1](ch01.html \"Chapter 1. The Art of Community\") inspired me to explore it\nfurther, this, my first event, secured my desire to make my passion for\ncommunity my career.\n\n# Building Family Values\n\nWay back in the first chapter, I waxed lyrical about _belonging_. This is the\nmagical substance that builds strong, enjoyable, and motivated communities.\nCommunities that instill a sense of belonging in their members are, by\ndefinition, mature and capable. Those who belong feel productive and\nempowered, and they form the firm foundation of your community.\n\nAlthough many of the workflow approaches we have covered in this book will\nbuild a sleek, efficient, and effective community, the impact of these\napproaches on belonging is primarily by association. When you have smooth\nprocesses and infrastructure in your community, it makes the community feel\neffortless, and it makes your community members feel productive. When they are\nproductive and enjoy the fruits of their labor, a sense of belonging begins to\ndevelop.\n\nGreat communities are built on great relationships. When people _really_ feel\na sense of belonging they are enjoying not only being productive but also\nswimming in the tide of your community’s personality. When you put productive\npeople together in a room (real or virtual) and they feel a sense of _family_\n, your community will be inundated with belonging.\n\n_Family_ is the operative word here. Many of us traditionally feel it from our\nexperiences with our parents and siblings, but we feel it elsewhere, too. Many\nwill feel a sense of family in their local bars and restaurants, at their\nschool or college, in coffee shops, and elsewhere. The sense of family exists\nwhen you not only feel a sense of belonging, but also share a very deep and\npersonal connection with other people.\n\nThe difference between _belonging_ and _family_ is subtle yet important. It is\nentirely possible that people can feel a sense of belonging and yet have\nlittle in the way of a personal engagement with other community members. I\nhave seen countless examples of members who enjoy an administrative role in a\ncommunity, be it system administration, resource management, or something\nelse. These members often enjoy the nuts and bolts of helping the community\nbut rarely socialize or engage with their fellow members. They feel a sense of\nbelonging because they know their contributions are respected by the wider\ncommunity and that their work is important for the community to prosper.\n\nAs community leaders we should aim for belonging but strive for family. A key\ntechnique for achieving this is _events_.\n\n# Events\n\nMost mornings my alarm goes off at 7:30 a.m. I wake up, grumble at the alarm,\nand then drag my sorry arse downstairs where I bow at the altar of the\ncoffeemaker. Still waking up, I struggle to comprehend the coffee-making\nsteps. I bumble through the process, spilling water everywhere, getting coffee\ngrounds stuck to my bathrobe, and generally hating the world until I have\nfinished chugging my thermos of wake-up juice that I clutch for dear life as I\nread my email.\n\nMy day then consists of the same approximate set of ingredients. I spend the\nmorning on the phone with my team, colleagues, community members, and\njournalists. I then attack my inbox with a piercing determination, grab a\nsandwich for lunch, and spend the afternoon working on my objectives and\ninitiatives. This, my friends, is my routine.\n\nYour community has a routine, too. Every day your community members will\nengage in their own set of stock interactions with your community. This may be\nsending email, having conversations, producing things, or other activities.\nWhatever these actions may be, they will happen each and every day—neither\ndifferent nor unexpected. So far in _The Art of Community_ , the topics we\nhave discussed have been the fodder that helps make this routine as enjoyable\nand productive as possible.\n\nThis is still, however, routine. It is healthy to break routine. For many,\nthis means a vacation, visits from friends and family, and other time away\nfrom the community. If you want to break routine yet still have your community\ncontributing, an excellent solution is to organize and run _events_.\n\nEvents are special, focused times in which a group of people do the same\nthing. This could be a large gathering such as a conference or a small online\nmeeting. Regardless of what the event is, every event gathers together a group\nof people at a set time. This gathering of people can be hugely motivating for\na community.\n\nAs we will discuss in more detail a little later, events don’t have to be\nphysical face-to-face meetings. They don’t have to be large and formalized,\nand they don’t have to be complex and expensive to organize. Events can be\nsmall, informal, and based online.\n\nWhatever kind of event you organize, it can offer a range of benefits to your\ncommunity:\n\nBuilding family\n\n    \n\nBringing people together, particularly in social settings, helps to build a\nsense of family. You want to have your community not only get on well in a\nproductive sense, but also get on well as friends. We will discuss this more\nlater.\n\nBreaking the routine\n\n    \n\nAll events break the routine. As an example, if you are an online, software-\noriented community, a physical event such as a conference or summit will get\nyou out of the house or office and meeting people and sharing conversations.\nIn the same manner, an online meeting will also break the routine: it will\nbring people together for a shared discussion, which is often fun and exciting\nto be a part of.\n\nFocusing the mind\n\n    \n\nEvents provide an excellent opportunity to focus your members on given\nprojects or targets. Many events focus on a particular date, release, or\nproject. An example of this is the Ubuntu Developer Summit, which focuses on\nthe next release of Ubuntu.\n\nIdentifying leaders\n\n    \n\nOrganizing an event almost always inspires the leaders and strongest\npersonalities in your community to bubble up to the surface. This is an\nexcellent opportunity to note these leaders as you grow your community. Events\nalso allow new people to shine: those who might not be programmers or master\nquilters—or whatever your community focuses on—can exercise other talents when\norganizing the event.\n\nTaking the pulse\n\n    \n\nEvents are a useful opportunity to get some insight into the goings-on of your\ncommunity. This insight will most typically be shared in social events, such\nas casual meetings in the bar during the evenings of a conference.\n\nThese benefits all help not only to keep your community productive, but also\nto excite, focus, and energize them. Events are an excellent opportunity to\nreally fire up your community, produce social bonds, and sow the seeds for\nlong and rewarding contributions to your community. Events are not merely\nnice, optional variations of the norm; they should be a regular part of your\ncommunity’s growth.\n\nAlthough all events used to fall into the same broad category of face-to-face\nmeetings, the explosion of the Internet and digital connectivity has opened\nthe door to a new breed of event that augments these traditional localized\nmeetings.\n\nAs such, events can be divided into two broad categories: _physical_ and\n_online_ events. We will examine both areas in detail throughout this chapter,\nbut let’s first have a look at how to organize events in general.\n\n# Getting Organized\n\nEvents, particularly physical events, are big barrels of details. Everyone I\nhave ever spoken to regarding event organization has always learned the hard\nway that being organized is the only way to ensure that all of your plans land\non the ground running. Getting a detail wrong can undermine the entire event.\nFor example, you may have a perfectly laid out conference but forget to get\nsigns made with directions to the different rooms, so people struggle to find\nthe location of the talks they are interested in.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Requirements\n\nYou need to choose which kind of event you would like to organize and then\nidentify which steps are involved. We will defer discussion of these steps\nuntil a little later when we delve into the different needs for various\nphysical and online events.\n\nWhen you have an idea of these needs, write them down and flesh out an action\nplan for carrying out that specific component. As an example, if one of those\nitems is accommodation, you should note each step involved in sourcing\naccommodation.\n\n## Step 2: Find Help\n\nThe next step is to find people to help you organize the event. This is\nparticularly important for physical events. For smaller events, such as small\nsprints, you may not require much help, but for larger events, such as\nconferences and summits, you will definitely need help.\n\nFor physical events it helps to find people in your community who are happy to\nlook after specific roles. Here are some of the role divisions that may apply\nto the events you run (not all will apply to every event):\n\nAccommodation\n\n    \n\nThis person organizes the hotel options and reservations.\n\nSponsorship\n\n    \n\nIf you are seeking sponsorship for the event, you should have a single point\nof contact to deal with the sponsors.\n\nMerchandise\n\n    \n\nIf you have t-shirts, lanyards, and other items that need to be arranged, this\nperson organizes these.\n\nSpeaker liaison\n\n    \n\nThis person will work to find and schedule speakers. This person also manages\nthe scheduling of speakers.\n\nSpecial events and catering\n\n    \n\nThis person will arrange any catering requirements as well as social events,\nparties, and additional gatherings.\n\nWhen you have these roles identified and filled, you should organize regular\nmeetings where organizers update one another on their progress in organizing\nthe event and discuss further work and any problems.\n\nI recommend that you hold these meetings every two weeks at first, and in the\ntwo months leading up to the event, accelerate the meetings to be held weekly.\nI also recommend that you organize conference calls, if possible, to host the\nmeetings, although an online chat medium will also work.\n\n### Note\n\nHere I have listed only the roles that apply to physical events. Physical\nevents are always much more complicated to organize than their online\ncounterparts: there are a lot more components to figure out, and many of these\ncomponents rely on outside parties, such as hotels, catering companies,\nequipment providers, and more. Although you can divide online event\norganization into roles, too, online events typically require far less work\nand can be organized by a single person.\n\nIf you find that your event is too much to handle for a single person, though,\ndo break it into roles in a similar way.\n\n## Step 3: Set Deadlines\n\nThis is what I consider the most valuable step of all in organizing your\nevent. You should look at the range of components in your event planning and\nproduce a set of deadlines that provide plenty of time to achieve those tasks.\n\nImagine you are organizing a conference. For each major task listed in the\nprevious section, you should prepare a set of deadlines. As an example, these\ncould be some deadlines for the process of opening up a call for papers,\nchoosing proposals, and announcing the final decided list of speakers:\n\n  * February 23—Begin planning Call for Papers and put together website form for submissions.\n\n  * March 9—Open up the event’s Call for Papers and publicize.\n\n  * April 13—Announce “One week left!” for the Call for Papers.\n\n  * April 20—Call for Papers closes. Announce.\n\n  * April 21—Begin reviewing submitted papers.\n\n  * April 27—Final list of papers decided. Notify all those who submitted papers of their success/rejection. Request confirmation of attendance. Begin developing the schedule.\n\n  * May 4—Announce the schedule.\n\nWhen you set this collection of deadlines, you should ensure that your fellow\norganizers can see them, too. A great solution to this is to set up a shared\ncalendar on a service such as Google Calendar and ensure that each organizer\nhas access.\n\n## Step 4: Make Time\n\nThe world is becoming an increasingly busy place, and time is an ever-rarer\nresource. You are a busy person, too: you are involved in your community; you\nare working to improve, enrich, and inspire; and you have your own set of\ntasks and responsibilities to look after. With so much going on, making the\ncommitment to run an event can be daunting. All of the event organizers I have\nspoken to about their first few events have always waxed lyrical about how\nmuch more time was required than they expected. You should ensure that you\nblock out a good amount of time so that you can give your event the amount of\ncare and feeding that it deserves.\n\nGoogle and Events\n\nLeslie Hawthorn leads the outreach side of Google’s Open Source Programs\nOffice, which focuses primarily on Google’s student programs, the Google\nSummer of Code for university students, and the Google Highly Open\nParticipation Contest for precollege students. Leslie has also been involved\nin the organization of many conferences, including the Ubuntu Developer\nSummits in 2006 and 2008, MeetBSD 2008 conference, GitTogether ’08, LugRadio\nLive USA 2008, and DjangoCon 2008\\. Leslie’s team has hosted more than 100\ncommunity events at the Google HQ over the past three years, and has worked\nwith community members on hundreds of sponsorships for other community events\nduring that time frame.\n\nLeslie is intimately familiar with the problem of not allocating enough time\nfor an event:\n\n“My basic rule on timing is to assume everything, from writing up conference\ncall notes to catering setup, will take at least two hours longer than I’ve\nplanned and to build in that margin for error into the whole of the event\nplan. It’s far better to have an extra few hours to brainstorm, have a coffee,\nand take stock than to run around fixing issues and leaving out details at the\nlast minute. It makes for a much better experience for the event organizers,\nas well, as they can focus on the pleasure of interacting with and learning\nfrom the attendees instead of putting out fires.”\n\nWhen considering how much time to allocate to your event organization, you\nshould not only determine the preparation time needed, but also how much time\nyou have available when the event is happening.\n\nThe days that the event is running are an incredibly stressful time for an\norganizer, and many of the frustrations and difficulties are caused by the\npressures of time constraints. Always try to factor in more time than you\nneed: having everything ready and waiting is a lot more fun than running\naround like a headless chicken panicking about time. Leslie also has some\nwords of wisdom on this topic:\n\n“People generally underestimate the amount of time it will take to get things\ndone, even when there are many hands to help with planning and execution. I’ve\nfound this situation to be especially true the day of an event; folks often\ndon’t leave themselves enough time for setup and attendees are left standing\naround waiting for the party to really get started.\n\n“Folks also tend to assume that a larger group of folks organizing logistics\nis better, but I’ve found this scenario only holds true when you have one or\ntwo charismatic folks giving direction to the rest of the organizing team.\nWithout clear instruction, people tend to get distracted by less important\ndetails or talking with friends, and a great organizer knows both how to\ndetect these lags early (and often) and how to politely refocus efforts on the\ntask at hand.\n\n“Also, your event managers need to remain available to direct traffic rather\nthan jumping into the fray until the finishing touches are required; shifting\nfocus from directing to doing can leave some folks unclear on what should\nhappen next, particularly when they’re in a brand-new location and are\nunfamiliar with how best to utilize the space or a venue’s processes for\nsetup, etc. When people aren’t sure what to do, this leads to distraction for\nthose team members who are focused on a particular task. As tempting as it is\nto jump in and help when managing an event, it’s best to hold back and make\nsure the organizing team feels empowered to get things done and clearly\nunderstands what’s expected of them.”\n\nTime is an important resource. Make sure you have plenty of it at your\ndisposal, and it will put your event in good stead.\n\n# Organizing Physical Events\n\nI don’t have space to cover all the types of events you might want to hold, so\nI’ll focus on the most popular and common events:\n\nSprints\n\n    \n\nCommon in the software development world, a sprint is when a number of\n(traditionally online-based) developers get together to work in the same\nphysical location. The foundation of a sprint is merely to be in the same room\nworking, but people naturally use the opportunity of being in the same\nlocation to have discussions, solve problems, and perform other activities.\n\nSummits\n\n    \n\nSummits are organized events in which the members have a series of discussion\nand debate sessions. Summits rarely have prepared presentations where someone\nspeaks and the audience listens. Summits are instead a series of discussion\nsessions that hopefully result in an outcome. We will talk more about summits\na little later in this chapter.\n\nConferences\n\n    \n\nConferences are composed of a series of presentations in which a speaker talks\nabout a topic and the audience listens. Conferences are primarily useful for\ndisseminating knowledge to others. Conferences are also a useful place to get\npeople together for other events. Some communities deliberately collocate\nother events, such as sprints, at times and places near conferences that many\npeople will be attending, in order to make it cheaper and easier for potential\nattendees to visit both.\n\nCons\n\n    \n\nCons (usually short for conventions) are popular in the user community,\nparticularly in story-related communities such as movies and comics. These\nevents are focused on fans coming together to celebrate something (e.g., _Star\nTrek_ fans coming together to discuss the show, showcase their outfits, and\nparticipate in other strange activities).\n\nRelease parties\n\n    \n\nRelease parties celebrate the release of something. These parties are common\nin the software, movie, and gaming worlds. These parties are often social\ngatherings in pubs and restaurants and have real value in building community.\nSome release events are fuller and incorporate presentations, workshops, and\nother features.\n\nEach type of event is composed of broadly the same ingredients: a group of\npeople meeting at the same venue to do something. The way they differ is in\nthe focus of the event, be it working together (sprint), discussing ideas\n(summit), sharing knowledge (conference), coming together to meet like minds\n(cons), or celebrating something (release parties).\n\nIt should also be noted that physical events are excellent opportunities for\nsocializing with your community. With each event, there is invariably an\nadjoining set of social events and parties to get your community members to\nenjoy one another’s company.\n\n## Common Attributes\n\nAlthough it may seem like the different types of physical events are very\ndissimilar, they all share some common ingredients. Before we move on to look\nat the specifics of some of these events, I want to discuss a few of these\nshared ingredients that apply to _all_ physical events. When you have a firm\nidea of how these ingredients will look, you will be 90% of the way to having\nyour event ready.\n\n### Note\n\nFor each of the following elements, ensure that you document all the details\non a website. Your event website is a critical component of your physical\nevent, and visitors will expect it to be up-to-date.\n\nIt is also recommended that you have a private organizers’ website that can\nact as a home for the many organizational details that develop as the\ndifferent parts of the event are put together. Ensure that this information is\nthere, too.\n\n### Location/venue\n\nAll physical events need a home. The first choice you need to make is the\nlocation. If you are organizing an event in which you expect your community to\nfund their own travel to attend, you should try to choose a location that is\nas convenient as possible for most of your members who are likely to attend.\nAs an example, if most of your members are on the East Coast of the United\nStates, hold it there. If most of your members are in Australia, hold it\nthere.\n\nChoosing a venue for your event depends heavily on the kind of event you are\norganizing. If you are holding a sprint, a small venue is likely to be\nsuitable, such as a hotel meeting room. If you are organizing a large\nconference, you may need a larger and more complex venue.\n\nIn addition to choosing the size of the venue, you should consider some other,\nsubtler elements:\n\nPublic transportation\n\n    \n\nCan your attendees get there on public transportation, and can they get\nelsewhere in the area, too?\n\nDistance from airport/train/bus stations\n\n    \n\nMany of your attendees may be flying in from other countries or getting\ntrains/buses to the event. You should try to aim for a venue that is a\nreasonable distance from those transport links. If people will incur a hefty\ntaxi bill to get to the venue, you will get some frustrated attendees.\n\nDistance from accommodations\n\n    \n\nMany people who attend an event may be in a hotel. Is the venue within a\nreasonable distance? There are few things more frustrating than a venue with\nno nearby accommodation.\n\nProximity to eating/drinking establishments\n\n    \n\nIf you are holding an all-day event (as many of these events are), you should\nensure that your attendees can easily get to local bars and restaurants.\nEnsure that the range here is as flexible as possible, too: are there\nvegetarian, vegan, and halal options? Many of your attendees will want to get\ntogether for some drinks and dinner. You should ensure that the bars and\nrestaurants are within reasonable distance, and if not, ensure that public\ntransportation can get people to them.\n\nCost\n\n    \n\nVenues range hugely in terms of cost. Here you should think imaginatively:\nconsider some less obvious venues as suitable options. As an example, when we\nwere organizing LugRadio Live in the United Kingdom, we considered options\nsuch as bars, music venues, and outdoor events. Unfortunately, desirable\nchoices for many of the other items on this list tend to require a high-cost\nlocation, because that’s the kind of location near airports, nice restaurants,\nand so on.\n\nA subtle consideration when choosing a venue is how your audience will\nperceive it. As an example, if you run a business community, you may want to\nchoose a venue that is more professionally oriented, such as a business center\nor hotel conference facility. If your community is more low-key, you will have\nmore flexibility with venue choice.\n\nWhen I was involved in organizing LugRadio Live, a loose, social, and informal\nevent that was part of our LugRadio podcast, we discounted many venues due to\nthe “feel.” We were explicitly looking to achieve a social environment for the\nshow, and many available places didn’t fit, including university lecture\ntheaters and hotel conference facilities. We instead chose student union bars,\nindependent theaters, and football stadium facilities: the latter all\nimmediately expressed a more social and fun feel than the former.\n\nAnother consideration is the venue’s environmental impact on the mood of the\nevent. When we organized the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Seville, Spain, the\nvenue was in a large underground conference facility in a hotel. There were no\nwindows, making the summit feel more constrained and causing people to tire\nearlier. The lack of windows meant attendees could not see daylight, and as\nsuch could not judge the time of day as the light changed.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> Contracts in the meeting and hospitality industry can be tricky and often\n> contain hidden expenses or restrictions that may not be obvious to you at\n> first.\n>\n> —Ilan Rabinovitch, on Contracts\n\nRead the [full interview](ch14.html#ilanrabinovich \"Ilan Rabinovitch, Southern\nCalifornia Linux Expo\") in [Chapter 14](ch14.html \"Chapter 14. Community Case\nBook\").\n\n### Accommodation\n\nFor many physical events, people from out of town will attend. This will\nusually mean they need to stay in a hotel. Many will expect you to tell them\nabout reasonable hotel options, so you should provide these on your event’s\nwebsite.\n\nThere are three tasks that you should work on in terms of accommodation:\n\nProvide a range of options\n\n    \n\nEveryone has different budgets when it comes to hotels. Provide details for a\nrange of room rates and quality.\n\nNegotiate a special room rate\n\n    \n\nCall each hotel in the area and ask if they can organize a special room rate\nfor you. Many hotels will provide a room rate if you ask your attendees to\ngive the hotel the event name or a special code. One thing to be cautious of:\nsome hotels want you to reserve a block of the hotel for the discounted rate.\nThis is risky if this is your first conference. Whatever you do, do not put\ndown an unaffordable deposit to reserve the rooms with the expectation that\npeople will come. It is too risky.\n\nDocument your hotels\n\n    \n\nPut a travel page on your website that contains all the hotels people can stay\nat. List the hotels in order, starting with the one offering the largest\ndiscount on the nightly rate. Ensure that you include the full address of the\nhotel (with zip/postal code so that people can put it in their GPS units), as\nwell as the telephone number.\n\nYou will probably find one or two hotels that are particularly accommodating\n(pun intended) to you and your event. Many of these hotels are hoping for\nrepeat business in future years if the event becomes an annual fixture. These\nrelationships can often blossom with positive effects on your event over the\nyears. When we organized LugRadio Live, our regular hotels would go\nincreasingly out of their way to provide a great service for us and our\nguests. Keep these hotel representatives in your circle of professional\nfriends.\n\nYou should always pick primary hotels for your event. When traveling to an\nevent from out of town and not knowing any of the natives, your attendees will\nwant to be in a hotel with other attendees so that they can socialize in the\nhotel bar, share cabs, and coordinate other activities. These primary hotels\nat events become a social hub. As such, when deciding which hotels will carry\nthis role, ensure that you check facilities such as bars, restaurants, and\nfitness centers.\n\nBargain Hunter\n\nWhen you ask for discounted room rates, it is likely the hotel will push back\nat first. Persevere. Tell them how important your event is, and tell them that\nyou really want to recommend their hotel as “an” (not “the”; that would be\nlying) official hotel.\n\nKeep asking and pushing for the discount. You have nothing to lose and lots to\ngain. If you get that discounted rate, it will make your event more affordable\nand allow more people to attend.\n\n### Equipment\n\nEvery event has equipment requirements. This can range from pens and paper to\ncomplex IT and networking facilities. You should ensure that you have a clear\nidea of your equipment needs and that you have a means of meeting them in time\nfor the event.\n\nAlthough seemingly a simple consideration, figuring out what you need to take\nto the event may be harder than you think. Imagine you are organizing a\nsprint. You may think of some of the obvious equipment requirements such as\nwhiteboards, pens, networking equipment, cables, and power strips. There are\nmany less obvious pieces of equipment, however, that you may not have thought\nof. This could include signs to show people where to go, adhesives such as\nBlu-Tack and tape, pins, lights, converter cables, speakers, notepads,\nwhiteboard dry wipes, and more. These simple and easily forgotten parts can\nmake a big difference!\n\nTo ensure that you don’t forget anything, you should jot down your full\nequipment needs and consult with your community to see if there is anything\nyou have forgotten. And like all your planning, the resultant list will be a\nuseful reference point for future events.\n\n### Date/time\n\nYou should announce the date of your event at least four months before it\nhappens. For events where you expect international visitors, I recommend you\nprovide six or preferably eight months’ advance notice so that there is enough\ntime for visas to be organized. Don’t let the wheels of government cause\nproblems. International visas were a scourge on events for the first few years\nafter the attacks of September 11, 2001, and can still get in the way of\ntravel between some countries.\n\nWhen picking a date for your event, you need to decide on two things:\n\nHow long\n\n    \n\nHow long will your event last? We will discuss this in more detail later when\nwe cover specific types of events.\n\nWhen\n\n    \n\nPicking a time can be complicated. You need to ensure that your event does not\nconflict with events of similar interest, that the dates are suitable for the\nvenue, and that they do not conflict with any holidays. You will never\ncompletely bypass every competing event and holiday, so use your best\njudgment.\n\nOne important tip that so many conferences and events still seem to get wrong:\nalways put the date of your conference on the front page of your website.\nDon’t bury the date three pages deep into the website. It will frustrate\npotential attendees and might suppress attendance.\n\n### Cost\n\nOne of the most difficult decisions to make for many events is whether to\ncharge for entry, and if so, how much. Much of this discussion is entirely\ndependent on the type of event that you are running, its expected attendee\ndemographics, and whether the event seeks to make a profit.\n\nThis was something we considered heavily for LugRadio Live. The event was very\nmuch intended to be a community event. It was never intended to make any\nprofit. The only concern was covering the cost of the event (and much of this\nwas reduced due to sponsorship, which we will discuss later).\n\nOne conscious decision for LugRadio Live was to make it affordable for\neveryone. We were not especially big fans (to say the least) of open source\nconferences for which community members were expected to pony up $800 to\nattend. We felt this produced a false economy: a conference in which\nsignificant portions of the demographic of open source members were unable to\nattend.\n\nOn the other hand, even though we had enough sponsorship to make the entrance\nto LugRadio Live free, we decided to charge a nominal fee (£5 at the door).\nThe reason for the charge was subtle: if something is free, people will rarely\ncommit to it. Even with a tiny cover charge, it would mean people who\nregistered to attend would actually show up.\n\n### Registering attendance\n\nFor many events there should be a means for attendees to let you know in\nadvance that they are going to attend.\n\nHaving this information is useful for a few reasons. By far the biggest worry\nin organizing an event is whether people are actually going to show up. This\nis typically less of a worry for invitation-only sprints, but a significant\ncause of nervous twitching when organizing a conference. It is always\nadvisable to have a way for people to register their attendance so that you\nhave an idea of where your numbers stand. Another benefit of knowing these\nnumbers is that if you have an outright success on your hands and are likely\nto have many more people attending, you can make preparations to deal with the\nincreased traffic at the event.\n\nIt is important to remember, though, that conference preregistration figures\noften don’t reflect the final attendance, particularly for events that are\nfree or where people can pay at the door. In these cases, where there is\nsimply no justification for them to preregister, there needs to be a reason\nand a catalyst, such as limited availability or discounted ticket prices. In\nthe eyes of a prospective attendee, simply saying, “It helps the organizers\nknow how many people are coming” is not adequate justification for\npreregistering; justification needs to be something the attendee will feel is\na personal benefit. This is where the cost of your event plays a large role.\nIf you are charging $1,000 for a conference ticket and preregistration allows\npeople to get a $400 discount on the ticket, you will see more\npreregistrations.\n\nAlthough many formal events keep attendee lists private, or share the lists\nonly with other attendees, many community events ask attendees to register\npublicly so that everyone can see who’s coming. This provides a small\nincentive to register in advance: attendees can then encourage colleagues whom\nthey want to meet to come.\n\nEvents have different approaches to registering attendance. For the majority\nof you reading this book, I am willing to bet that you are primarily\norganizing small summits and sprints for your community. In these cases, a\nwiki page is a perfect solution: simply ask your community members to add\nthemselves to a page if they plan to attend.\n\nFor much larger conferences and sprints, you may want to use a conference\nmanagement system or a custom website to handle the attendance registration\nprocess. You also may want to include an online payment process with your\nregistration facility.\n\n### Catering\n\nYou need to decide whether you want to have food at your event. For a daytime\nevent, this is most typically lunch and breaks. If it is an evening event, the\ncatering is usually dinner and drinks.\n\nCatering can make the cost of the event balloon, so you need to consider it\ncarefully. An added complication is that many venues will restrict you to\nusing only their on-site kitchen or a specific vendor. You should check this\nwhen investigating the venue. Such locked-in vendors usually lead to\noutrageously inflated costs, but you can’t really blame the venue, because it\nhas its own advantages in maintaining a relationship with a vendor who gets to\nknow it well.\n\nExpectations around catering vary. For a small, locally organized event,\ncatering is not typically expected. If you are organizing a large professional\nconference, lunch will be expected, particularly if you are charging a\nsignificant entrance fee. Regardless of what you decide, it is highly\nrecommended that you have drinks available: people get thirsty throughout the\nday, particularly if there is lots of discussion.\n\nIf you do decide to cater your event, a buffet-style format is recommended for\nboth lunch and dinner options. It is easier to organize, promotes socializing\n(instead of people sitting at the same place at a dinner table all night), and\nis often cheaper.\n\nIf You Don’t Cater...\n\n...you should ensure that you provide details of local, reasonably priced food\nand drink providers. I always recommend providing a list of fast food\nrestaurants as well as sit-down restaurants and bars. Again, the key is to\nprovide a range of options that can suit as many tastes and budgets as\npossible.\n\n### Insurance/unions\n\nOne area that you should properly investigate when planning your event is the\ninsurance needs and possible union requirements for your area. These issues\nvary tremendously around the world.\n\nI experienced this firsthand when comparing the experience of organizing\nLugRadio Live in the United Kingdom and in San Francisco. The events were a\nworld apart in terms of insurance and union requirements. The San Francisco\nevent was a far more complicated affair with more rigorous and complex\nrequirements than its UK counterpart.\n\nWith the laws and requirements varying so much around the world, it is\ndifficult for me to give any concrete advice other than to ensure that you\ncheck these legal elements thoroughly. If you are unsure, ask the venue\nmanagement for its advice.\n\n### Note\n\nYou should also make a point of looking into basic first aid facilities. If\nsomeone slices his hand open or passes out, you want to be able to react\nappropriately. Preferably you should have someone available on-site who knows\nfirst aid.\n\n## Organizing a Sprint\n\nSprints are events in which your community gathers together to work in the\nsame physical location. Sprints rarely have any special timetabled content,\nsuch as talks or presentations, and their primary focus is more on getting\npeople to work individually or on shared projects, taking advantage of the\nface-to-face time to have discussions and solve problems together where\nrequired.\n\nThe primary requirement for a sprint is to provide a working environment. This\nis dependent on the kind of work your community performs, but for most\ncommunities it’s likely to be a conference room with tables and chairs where\nyour community can sit together to work.\n\nI have organized a number of sprints for different purposes, including\nspecific team sprints for my own team and wider community sprints. You should\nalways allow a sprint to be a sprint. Over the years I have seen many people\norganize sprints and instead try to turn them into more of a summit, replete\nwith brainstorming sessions. I was one of them. When I used to organize\nsprints for my team, I would run them largely as minisummits, and we would\ndiscuss and flesh out plans for the coming cycle. At one wider team sprint I\ncould not be there with my team, and they reported back that having the\nopportunity to just work, as opposed to brainstorm, was hugely productive.\nSince then I have been careful to ensure that sprints are primarily focused on\nworking together. To achieve this, I reserve the mornings for brainstorming\nand the afternoons for sprinting.\n\n### Additional notes\n\nHere are some additional notes that build on the topics I covered in general\nearlier:\n\nLocation/venue\n\n    \n\nSprints are typically smaller events and require smaller venues. Bear in mind\nthat the sprint is intended to be a working session, and therefore you may\nneed facilities for this work, such as Internet access, plenty of power\noutlets, and tables and chairs. For a small sprint the venue can be informal\nand loose, with many communities sprinting in houses and apartments.\n\nAccommodation\n\n    \n\nThere are no special accommodation requirements for sprints.\n\nEquipment\n\n    \n\nThe equipment requirements depend on the type of work you will be doing. As an\nexample, if you are doing software development, people should bring their own\nlaptops, but you may want to provide blank media, commonly requested cables,\npower strips, USB storage devices, and so on.\n\nDate/time\n\n    \n\nThe length of the sprint should reflect how long you can reasonably expect\npeople to be together. Do remember that people will need to book time off work\nto be there, and some may be away from their families and children. I\nrecommend that a sprint range from three to five days. I do not recommend a\nsprint that lasts longer than a week.\n\nCost\n\n    \n\nTo the best of your ability, sprints should be free. You should seek to cover\nyour costs with sponsorship if your organization can’t pony up the funds\nitself.\n\nRegistering attendance\n\n    \n\nYou will want to get a firm idea of who is coming, but also make the sprint\nopen so that anyone is welcome to attend. Specialist sprints will require\nspecific invitations to the people whom you want to attend.\n\nCatering\n\n    \n\nMany smaller sprints either provide a buffet lunch or defer lunch to nearby\nrestaurants. You should have plenty of water and cups available, and\npreferably some sodas or coffee. Some caffeinated beverages are particularly\nimportant if you have a long sprint: people will rely on them to wake up in\nthe mornings.\n\nInsurance/unions\n\n    \n\nAs always, check into the insurance requirements for the sprint. There are\nunlikely to be union issues.\n\n## Organizing a Summit\n\nSummits are organized events in which your community gathers to discuss and\ndebate a set of topics with the purpose of accomplishing a goal.\n\nAn example of this is the Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS). During every release\ncycle, the Ubuntu community gathers together to discuss, debate, and design\nthe next release of Ubuntu. The summit is broken into a number of tracks\n(community, desktop, server, mobile, quality assurance, etc.), each containing\na number of sessions. Each session has a leader who focuses the discussion on\nthe topic, and the attendees weigh in and discuss the best choices. By the end\nof the session, the expected outcome is a broad solution that can then be\ndocumented as a specification from which the community can work.\n\nThe UDS is a large and comprehensive summit that has been running for a number\nof years. It attracts more than 200 attendees, involving a huge range of\nsessions over multiple concurrent tracks, and remote participation. Organizing\nand running the event is a large and comprehensive undertaking, and it would\nrequire another book the size of _The Art of Community_ to discuss all the\ndetails. I do, though, want to distill some of the key lessons learned from\norganizing the UDS that you can apply to your own summits.\n\n### Structure and scheduling\n\nThe primary goal of a summit is to ensure that people can discuss and debate\ntopics to the point of producing a solution. For this you need to have a\ntemplate for how many sessions will appear in your schedule. As an example,\nyou might have the following schedule.\n\n8:30 a.m. |  Doors Open  \n---|---  \n9 a.m. – 10 a.m. |  Session  \n10 a.m. – 11 a.m. |  Session  \n11 a.m. – noon | Session  \nnoon – 1 p.m. |  Lunch  \n1 p.m. – 2 p.m. |  Session  \n2 p.m. – 3 p.m. |  Session  \n3 p.m. – 3:30 p.m. |  Break  \n3:30 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. |  Session  \n4:30 p.m. – 5:30 p.m. |  Session  \n5:30 p.m. – 6 p.m. |  Closing/Wrap-Up  \n  \nThis schedule is productive but not too taxing on your visitors. It provides\nsix session blocks with breaks for lunch and other rest, ensuring that your\nattendees don’t go for too long without a break, which is always recommended.\n\nIf you find that you are going to require more than six sessions on one day,\nyou may want to consider multiple tracks—sessions running at the same time. As\nan example, at the last UDS there were seven concurrent tracks. Of course,\nthere is an obvious downside to this approach: people can’t be in two (or\nseven!) places at the same time. With this in mind, you need to ensure that\nthe tracks are distinct and will attract different interests.\n\nWhen having multiple tracks, you should account for a lot of time spent moving\naround.\n\n### Inside a session\n\nFor each session, ensure that the room is set up to encourage discussion.\nChairs should be in circles or around tables, not facing front, which implies\nthat only the session leader matters.\n\nEach session should have two people serving specific roles:\n\nLeader (also known as a facilitator)\n\n    \n\nThe leader is responsible for ensuring that the session is kept on-topic.\nSessions can easily get sidetracked, so the leader must be prepared to bring\ndiscussion back. The leader should also ensure that everyone gets a chance to\nspeak and that the session reaches a conclusion. Every session should result\nin a set of actions to implement the work that was discussed in the session.\n\nBe careful in your wording here. A _leader_ is often assumed to have special\nexpertise or authority. Some people prefer _facilitator_ just because they\ndon’t like the presumption that the leader tells other people what to do.\n\nNotetaker\n\n    \n\nIn the interests of referencing the session as well as transparency and\nopenness for people who can’t attend the summit, a person should take notes\nabout what was discussed and the concluded actions. Some sessions find it\nuseful to post notes on a bulletin board or easel. In any case, the session\nleader should not be the notetaker; each role requires full concentration and\na different kind of thinking.\n\nAlways be conscious of community members who can’t attend sessions. Your notes\nshould help them feel a part of the session, but you may also want to consider\noptions for remote participation. This could be as simple as a conference\nphone that people dial into or as complex as a video link. Twitter and/or\nidenti.ca could be great options for this. Physical attendees could post\nmessages of what is being discussed, and online attendees can then read and\nrespond.\n\nI have been involved with a variety of methods of remote participation. A\nconference phone to dial into is always a useful option: it is low maintenance\nand requires little conscious thought. A video link is more complex and more\nintrusive in the session because it relies on members of the session to\noperate the camera so that it points at the person who is speaking. Another\npossible option is an audio feed that streams onto the Internet. People can\nthen respond to topics via an online chat service such as IRC, or even a\nmicroblogging service such as Twitter or identi.ca. You should evaluate your\noptions and see what is doable with the resources and time that you have\navailable.\n\n### Event-specific notes\n\nHere are some additional notes that build on the topics I covered in general\nearlier:\n\nLocation/venue\n\n    \n\nSummits are typically small to medium-size events and often include multiple\nconcurrent tracks that will need separate rooms. You may also want to provide\na morning plenary presentation for all the guests, which will require a larger\nroom. Bear in mind that the summit is intended to be a working session, and\nyou may therefore need facilities such as Internet access, plenty of power\noutlets, and tables and chairs.\n\nAccommodation\n\n    \n\nThere are no special accommodation requirements for summits.\n\nEquipment\n\n    \n\nSummits are generally entirely discussion-led, but you may need to supply an\nInternet connection, data projectors, whiteboards, writing pads, and pens and\npencils.\n\nDate/time\n\n    \n\nThe length of the summit should reflect how long you can reasonably expect\npeople to be together. Do remember that people will need to book time off work\nto be there, and some may be away from their families and children. I\nrecommend that a summit range from three to five days. I do not recommend a\nsummit that lasts longer than a week.\n\nCost\n\n    \n\nTo the best of your ability, summits should be free (free events provide a\nlower barrier to participation and do not exclude those who can’t afford the\nfee to get in). You should seek to cover your costs with sponsorship if your\norganization can’t cover the funds itself.\n\nRegistering attendance\n\n    \n\nYou will want to get a firm idea of who is coming, but also make the summit\nopen so that anyone is welcome to attend. As such, it is recommended that you\nhave an attendee list but also publicize the open nature of the event.\n\nCatering\n\n    \n\nMany smaller summits either provide a buffet lunch or defer lunch to nearby\nrestaurants. You should have plenty of water and cups available, and\npreferably some sodas or coffee. Some caffeinated beverages are particularly\nimportant if you have a long summit: people will rely on them to wake up in\nthe mornings.\n\nInsurance/unions\n\n    \n\nAs always, check into the insurance and union requirements for the summit.\n\nCase Study: Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit\n\nFor some time Google has been running a program called Google Summer of Code,\nwhich provides funding for open source projects to develop new code, features,\nand initiatives. The program has been overwhelmingly successful. Hundreds of\nprojects have benefited, and millions of dollars have left Google’s ample\nwallet as part of the program.\n\nEach year Google invites two individuals from each successful project involved\nin Google Summer of Code to its annual Mentor Summit at Google HQ. Leslie\nHawthorn of Google reports:\n\n“I’m particularly proud of the feedback we’ve received on the Summits, our\nattendees repeatedly telling us that the connections they make that weekend\nlead to collaborative development between projects. It’s also an excellent\nopportunity for these seasoned Open Sourcerers to share best practices and not\njust around participating in Google Summer of Code; some of the most important\nknowledge-sharing that takes place at the Summits is when contributors finally\nget to meet face-to-face; exchange ideas; and form the social ties that cause\npatches to be reviewed and merged more quickly, requests for support answered\nrapidly, etc. The typical view of FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software)\ndevelopment is that everything takes place online, but that’s only a part of\nthe interactions that fuel Open Source; without these in-person meetings,\nestablishing a reputation and securing the trust of one’s fellow project\nmembers certainly occurs, but much more slowly. Bringing together these\nexperts from each project helps everyone to build rapport rapidly, greasing\nthe wheels of online activity through social bonds.\n\n“We primarily organize the Summits by using our mailing lists and a wiki. Each\nparticipant is encouraged to propose sessions in advance of the unconference,\nwith all suggestions collected on the wiki; the mailing list is primarily a\nvehicle for reminding folks to update our shared online resource. Once\nattendees arrive, we ask them to write out their ideas for session topics on\nlarge pieces of paper, which are then posted for all to review. Each attendee\nis given sticker dots so that she can +1 sessions, meaning adding a dot to the\ntopic’s poster signifies interest in attending a particular discussion. This\nsystem allows us to easily determine which sessions require the largest amount\nof space for participants, which is particularly handy when managing logistics\nfor an unconference, as there’s no set agenda in advance. The posters also\ngive us all the opportunity to discern which ideas are most compelling—and\nwhich challenges are most daunting—within our community. By structuring the\nmeeting as truly participant-driven, our attendees are guaranteed to get\nprecisely what they need from their participation provided they put energy\ninto the wider discussion.\n\n“During sessions, we encourage everyone to take notes on the conference wiki\nto most widely share what they’ve learned. As is typical during any\nconference, there are many more sessions that attendees would like to go to\nthan they actually are able to, so these notes allow folks to glean something\nfrom the discussions that took place and to know whom to follow up with later\nfor additional exploration or collaboration. The good folks at Oregon State\nUniversity’s Open Source Lab host this community wiki for us, which is\nglobally readable so that everyone has the benefit of our collective\nexperience. Several community members have volunteered to administer the wiki\nand are actively (re)organizing the content so it’s most useful to would-be\nGoogle Summer of Code participants and anyone else looking to run a similar\noutreach program. See <http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/Main_Page>.”\n\n## Organizing an Unconference\n\nUnconferences are a relatively new addition to the menagerie of commonly\norganized physical event types. In its goals, an unconference appears to be\nthe same as a normal conference: a group of people gather in a venue to watch\na series of talks and discussions. There is, though, one key difference: an\nunconference has its schedule created on the day of the event in an entirely\nfree-form way. One example of an unconference is the Community Leadership\nSummit, an event which I organize each year to bring community leaders,\nmanagers, and organizers together. You can find more details about the event\nat <http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com>.\n\nThe history of unconferences traces back to O’Reilly’s invitation-only geek\nevent, FooCamp (“Friends of O’Reilly” camp). The real success and growth of\nunconferences has been exhibited by the BarCamp spin-off events.\n\nBarCamp was originally a joke between Chris Messina and a couple of friends\nregarding some somewhat disgruntled people who had not been invited to\nO’Reilly’s FooCamp. Curious as to why these people were complaining, Chris and\nfriends decided to run an equivalent event, coining it BarCamp, as a nod to\nthe (ironic in this case) foobar references in O’Reilly books. Chris explained\nto me how the event came about:\n\n> We just thought it’d be fun to get a bunch of friends together and have an\n> emergent (or “open space”) event to offset FooCamp. The crazy thing is that\n> we planned the whole thing in only six days. I was on Instant Messenger and\n> email and calling people trying to get a venue: originally thinking of doing\n> real camping in the mountains! When nothing panned out, Ross Mayfield from\n> SocialText saw Andy Smith’s call for a space, realized that we were just\n> down the street, and offered up his new space down the road. Once we had a\n> venue, everything fell into place.\n\nSince these humble beginnings, there have been over 500 BarCamps in all the\nmajor inhabited continents. There have also been less-nerdy spin-off events,\nwith one such example being WineCamp, a derivative of BarCamp in which a mix\nof nonprofits and technology fans camp out at a vineyard with no water or\npower. Chris noted that not having Internet access and power was actually a\nboon:\n\n> On the second day of the camp, we went to a winery where we had WiFi and\n> power and worked on producing all the ideas we’d brainstormed offline the\n> previous day. It was seriously productive and hugely interdisciplinary. It’s\n> events like that that blur boundaries and encourage diversity that I think\n> are the most rewarding to me.\n\nUnconferences are an excellent way to host discussions that everyone has the\nopportunity to drive. They are, by definition, intrinsically open events. By\nallowing your guests to set the schedule on the same day, you are opening up\nthe event to all manner of topics, even if attendees prepare a session before\nthey arrive and volunteer it.\n\nFrom my experience with unconferences, the free-form scheduling always\nuncovers unusual and intriguing topics. There will be topics proposed that you\nor a wider scheduling body would have never thought of, and this can make for\nsome really interesting and fascinating discussion.\n\nFortunately, unconferences are devilishly simply to organize. In addition to\nthe obvious resources, such as a venue and attendees, your primary\nconsideration is a place where people can add their sessions to the agenda.\nMost unconferences feature a large whiteboard (or two whiteboards side-by-\nside) on which you write the conference grid. This is a box that shows the\nrooms along the top and the times down the side. This will result in a number\nof session slots in which people can write in their sessions. The whiteboard\nshould be in a central location that’s easy for people to check regularly.\n\n### Note\n\nNormally with an unconference there’ll be 100 or so attendees and quite a lot\nof talk tracks (say, 7), so each talk is expected to attract only 10 or 20\npeople; this means you need lots of small rooms, not one big one, and it means\na talk is less intimidating for a speaker because talks normally end up being\ndiscussions anyway when there are only 6 of you.\n\nAnother consideration is to provide a wiki and other resources to wrap around\nthe event. Even Chris Messina, one of the originators of this style of event,\nlikes to keep things simple:\n\n> [For BarCamp] we really relied on the wiki, the mailing list, blog posts,\n> and photos posted to Flickr. In the early days, I’d say that made up 98% of\n> the documentation. There was also word of mouth, of course—individuals\n> became spreading vectors in and of their own right. The rules themselves\n> were also fairly viral—I mean, we basically stated, along the lines of\n> _Fight Club_ , “If this is your first time at BarCamp, you must present!” We\n> weren’t draconian about it, but that was an important aspect of the event:\n> no spectators.\n\nGiven the slightly unusual format of an unconference, it is recommended that\nyou attend a few of these events before you organize your own.\n\n### Event-specific notes\n\nHere are some additional notes that build on the topics I covered in general\nearlier:\n\nLocation/venue\n\n    \n\nAlthough many unconferences are called camps, a campsite is not typically\nrequired as a venue. Provide a number of breakout rooms in which to have the\ndifferent sessions. These rooms will need to have tables and chairs.\n\nAccommodation\n\n    \n\nAgain, camping facilities are not typically required. If you do want the event\nto take place at a campsite, ensure that you have an area in which your\nattendees can pitch tents. Also ensure that there are toilet and washroom\nfacilities. Some unconferences that take place in offices allow people to\nsleep on the office floor. If you do this, make sure you remind people to\nbring sleeping bags.\n\nEquipment\n\n    \n\nThe main equipment that you will need includes a large whiteboard and dry-\nerase markers that your attendees can use to contribute their sessions to the\nschedule.\n\nDate/time\n\n    \n\nUnconferences are typically no longer than one or two days.\n\nCost\n\n    \n\nCosts vary between these events.\n\nRegistering attendance\n\n    \n\nAttendance registration at unconferences varies: some are open events with\nopen attendance, and some are closed, invitation-only events.\n\nCatering\n\n    \n\nMany unconferences either provide a buffet lunch or defer lunch to nearby\nrestaurants. You should have plenty of water and cups available, and\npreferably some sodas or coffee. Some caffeinated beverages are particularly\nimportant if you have a long unconference: people will rely on them to wake up\nin the mornings.\n\nInsurance/unions\n\n    \n\nAs always, check into the insurance and union requirements for the venue.\n\n# Getting Sponsorship\n\nEveryone reading this book is lucky, because community is one of the rare\nplaces in the world in which we can exist, build bridges, and reward victories\nwithout bowing to the filthy lucre. In our palm-lined oasis, money is rarely a\nconsideration. Sometimes, though, it is.\n\nThe vast majority of physical events cost money. Venues need to be booked,\nequipment needs to be rented or purchased, and other costs need to be covered.\nUnless you are charging an entrance fee that covers costs or another party you\nknow is feeling particularly generous, it is likely you are going to need to\nfind sponsorship to cover these costs. Let’s now take a little time to talk\nabout what is involved in finding sponsorship.\n\n## Understanding Your Needs\n\nSponsorship is a somewhat hit-or-miss process. Although your community does\ngood and valid work, what you are essentially doing here is asking someone for\nsome free money. It doesn’t matter if the party you are asking is a large\ncompany. Large companies still need to account for the purposes of their\nexpenditures, and particularly when the economy is facing difficult times,\njustification has never been more important.\n\nFortunately, I have a surefire way to improve your chances of getting\nsponsored. This is a theory that has been designed, refined, tested, and\nfurther refined to present a cookie-cutter concept that can be applied\nperfectly to your community—a cookie cutter built from reason, experience, and\nperfected mathematical ingenuity:\n\nThe less money you ask for, the more likely you are to get it.  \n---  \n  \nPretty stunning stuff, eh?\n\nOK, back to the point. Consider yourself in the position of Chief Checkbook\nHolder for a large organization. If one community asks for $500 and another\ncommunity asks for $5,000, which are you more likely to scrutinize? From which\nare you more likely to demand your money’s worth in associated advertising and\nfavors? Which are you more likely to say no to?\n\n### Note\n\nAlthough this theory can be applied in a general sense to most volunteer\ncommunity events, if you are organizing a large conference event (particularly\nif the audience is composed of professionals), asking for more money can\nlegitimize the event. Although true, you should tread carefully with this\napproach: get it wrong and you may get nothing.\n\nIf you are considering asking for a significant sum of money, I recommend you\nspeak to someone with event organization experience first and get that\nperson’s take before you click the Send button on your proposal to the\nsponsor.\n\nAs such, you need to perform an exercise in cost cutting. You should first\nproduce a big list of everything that is going to cost money, in either rental\nor purchase costs. This list should be accurate and complete. Everything from\npens to the venue to expensive computing equipment should be on that list.\n\nYour next step is to go through the list and turn it into a trimming exercise.\nThe goal here is not to remove things you actually need, but instead to find\nways to source those things without paying for them. I know I shouldn’t need\nto say this, but people…stealing is not an option. If I get a letter from my\nattorney telling me that a community project leader is in prison for stealing\n20 rack-mount servers and is pinning it on “the British dude who wrote _The\nArt of Community_ ,” I am not going to be particularly happy.\n\nWhat I am suggesting is that you try to source those things by borrowing,\nsharing, making, or otherwise gathering them. Follow the general theme of the\nbook here: think outside the box. Inspire yourself to get as much of what you\nneed as you can without merely going and paying for it.\n\nWhen we started organizing LugRadio Live in England, we did a lot of this. We\nborrowed projectors from some friends, and the screens from others. We got\ndonations of paper and pens from an office worker whose company had plenty of\nspare supplies to contribute; we produced the name badges, posters, and\nprograms ourselves; we asked a conference to give us spare lanyards, as they\ndidn’t need them; we provided the audio equipment ourselves; and we used a\ncut-out potato and ink to stamp the hands of attendees (really). Although some\nof this may seem a little cheap, what many of you want to achieve is not a\nlarge business conference. We are a volunteer community, and it is OK to be a\nlittle rough around the edges. Rough around the edges and endearing are close\nbedfellows (no one has ever forgotten that potato stamp).\n\nWhen you have been through your list and have a final tally of things you just\nhave to rent or buy, calculate the cost of those elements. You now have a much\nlower figure to request sponsorship for, and you are much more likely to get\nit.\n\nSweat Versus Sponsorship\n\nI hate to belabor the point, but after my previous diatribe about thinking\noutside the box to source what you need without having to ask for sponsorship,\nI know many of you will think, “Well, it’s just going to be easier to ask for\nthe sponsorship.”\n\nIt is easier. I am not denying that. But being frugal with the mighty buck is\nnot only a positive exercise in how to put together an event, but importantly,\nit is the _right thing to do_ for your sponsor.\n\nIf you treat them with respect by asking only for exactly what you need, you\nwill be sowing the seeds for a long and fruitful relationship.\n\n## Finding and Handling Sponsors\n\nBy now you have your sponsorship figure. The next step is to determine how\nmany sponsors are likely to be able to cover it. Of course, anything to do\nwith figures is difficult to provide concrete advice for, so take some of\nthese words as general guidelines only.\n\nIf you need $2,000 or less, it is likely that you can find a single sponsor\nwho can probably cover the full cost. Still, you may want to consider breaking\nthe figure in half (e.g., $1,000 per sponsor) and therefore asking each\nsponsor for less. Remember the golden rule:\n\nThe less money you ask for, the more likely you are to get it.  \n---  \n  \nWhen you have an idea of how much you want to ask from each sponsor, you can\nbegin thinking of potential sponsors.\n\nThe best bets for potential sponsors are companies that are related to your\ncommunity’s activities. As an example, if you are an open source community,\nthere is a raft of open source companies and wider IT companies with an\ninterest in open source. Naturally, another indicator toward a potential “yes”\non your sponsorship request is that the company has money. If the company is\nknown to be struggling financially, save your energy and focus only on cash-\npositive organizations.\n\nDetermining potential sponsors can be a tricky road to navigate. The best way\nto do this is to run the idea of sponsorship by some people you know well in\nexisting companies who are potential sponsors. They may be able to help you\nget up to the next rung in the ladder. Every time I have organized an event\nthat needed sponsorship, this has been my first port of call.\n\nAnother approach is to meet someone involved in an existing event that is\nsimilar to your own and ask how that person handled sponsorship. Another\nuseful technique is to look at the sponsorship lists for these other events.\nOften the primary sponsors are listed on the front page of the event website.\n\n### Setting expectations\n\nWhen asking for sponsorship, it’s important to remember that you are engaging\nin a business transaction. The organization giving you money expects something\nin return. Specifically what they expect varies tremendously between sponsors.\n\nSome sponsors will expect almost nothing. A good example of this is a company\ncalled Bytemark Hosting, which has sponsored every year of LugRadio Live since\nit began. The company has provided venue sponsorship year after year, even\nback when no one knew the event or its expectations. Bytemark not only had\nfaith in the event but was gracious in its expectations: all it wanted was an\nexhibition table.\n\nOn the other hand, some sponsors want the moon on a stick. Another (unnamed to\nprotect the innocent) sponsor I have dealt with wanted branding scattered\nacross the venue, weekly calls with its demanding marketing manager, regular\nbranding mentions in the podcast that we did, control over the size and\nlocation of its booth, and other requests. The experience with that sponsor\nwas, frankly, a huge headache that none of the event organizers needed,\nespecially with so much else going on.\n\nYou need to set your own balance of what to offer and ensure that sponsorship\nrequirements don’t impinge on the values of the event. For LugRadio Live, we\ndecided on a set of opportunities that we would present to sponsors in\nexchange for sponsorship, offers that we felt did not compromise the ethics or\natmosphere of the show. These included:\n\n  * Sponsor logo printed on the back of the program\n\n  * Small sponsor logo printed on the back of the presenter and crew t-shirts\n\n  * Sponsor logo and link presented on the event website\n\n  * Exhibitor space at the event in a location where the most traffic flowed\n\n  * A thanks to the sponsor in the LugRadio live show in front of the event audience\n\nIn addition to this, we clarified with all sponsors that no editorial content\nor changes could be mandated by a sponsor. In other words, we would always\nhave complete control of the content of the podcast, as before.\n\nWhen you want to approach sponsorship, you need to have your own list of\nbullet points indicating what you can offer the sponsor. The ones I listed are\na good starting point.\n\nWhen you put together your list like the one just shown, be sure to clarify\nhow sponsorship intersects with editorial privilege. For instance, a logo is\nobviously a form of advertising and simply indicates you made a deal for much-\nneeded financial support. In contrast, some forms of sponsorship are a bit\ninsidious. When a sponsor gets the right to deliver a keynote, you are\npretending to offer your attendees useful information when all you’re doing is\ndelivering them up as a captive audience for marketing.\n\n### The pitch\n\nNow that you have your sponsorship figure and your set of bullet points to\nindicate what you will offer, you need to put together your pitch. It should\nbe a short document that outlines the event, what you need sponsorship for,\nand what you can offer the sponsor.\n\nThe length of this pitch should reflect the amount of money you are asking for\nand the complexity of the event. If you are organizing a large conference with\n2,000 expected attendees and are asking for $50,000, you should sharpen your\npencil and prepare a comprehensive, detailed, multipage sponsorship request.\n\nI am willing to bet that 98% of you reading this are not in that position and\nare instead asking for a fraction of that amount for an event with no more\nthan a few hundred attendees. As such, your pitch can be much more\nstraightforward and can fit into a one- or two-page document or a single email\nto the sponsor.\n\nIn your pitch, you should include the following details:\n\nKey information about the event\n\n    \n\nThe name of the event, where it is located, the date(s) that it is happening,\nand the number of expected attendees. You should also do your best to describe\nyour attendees’ interests; sponsors want to know that their company logos will\nbe seen by people who could become customers.\n\nPurpose\n\n    \n\nWhy the event is important and unique.\n\nRequested figure\n\n    \n\nThe required sponsorship amount and the date by which you need it.\n\nReason for sponsorship\n\n    \n\nWhat the sponsorship money will cover. Be honest here; don’t say that $500 is\ngoing to cover way more than it can reasonably cover.\n\nWhat the event provides\n\n    \n\nThe set of bullet points indicating what you can provide in exchange for the\nmoney.\n\nContact details\n\n    \n\nYour name, email address, and a daytime and evening phone number.\n\nYour pitch should be straight to the point, respectful, frank, and complete\nwith all of the details just shown. When you have your list of sponsors and\ncontact people, you should send off your pitch and cross your fingers.\n\n### Note\n\nWhatever you do when emailing sponsors, don’t email multiple sponsors at the\nsame time. In other words, don’t send an email with a CC list as long as your\narm. It is cheap and disrespectful to your sponsors.\n\nEach potential sponsor that you send your pitch to should get an email\ndirected specifically to that contact, personally addressed to the contact\n(e.g., “Dear Alan”).\n\n## Handling the Money\n\nIf you manage to source an agreed level of sponsorship from a company or two,\ncongratulations! The next step is to know how to deal with the money.\n\nIf you are dealing with a small sponsor, the transfer of the money will likely\nbe quick and efficient. Some sponsors may just cut you a check or perform a\nbank transfer. Other sponsors may have more complex requirements and request\ninvoices, purchase orders, or other paperwork.\n\nWhen you agree to the sponsorship amount and conditions, you should ensure\nthat you are entirely clear on how this process works. The reason for this is\ntwofold. First, satisfying these requirements may take time, and you want to\nensure that this time is factored into your plans. What you don’t want to do\nis get into a situation in which you have ordered a lot of equipment and\nresources and have not yet received the sponsorship money to pay for it. That\nhappens way more than it should, so be cautious of it.\n\nThe second reason is that sponsorship can open up a rabbit warren of other\nheadaches. As an example, consider this trail of dependencies:\n\n  1. To get the sponsorship money, the sponsor requires a bank account to transfer the money to.\n\n  1. To set up a bank account, you may need to be a registered organization in your country. This will require certain community members to be signatories on the account. And this in turn may require some kind of community assessment of who takes on these responsibilities.\n\n  2. To be a registered organization, you will need to file your taxes. This will require a formal paper trail. You will also need a regular reassessment of how well the members who are representing this organization are functioning.\n\nNone of this work is enjoyable. It is a painful bureaucratic necessity for\naccepting sponsorship money. You should ensure that you are entirely clear on\nthe ramifications for accepting the money from sponsors and what is involved.\nKeep it as simple as possible.\n\nAvoid Headaches: Invoice Directly\n\nA great approach that can avoid the problems of managing money is to never\nhandle money in the first place and simply have the sponsors invoiced. As an\nexample, if you need to spend $500 to hire a venue, just ask the venue to bill\nthe sponsor. This means the money never passes through your hands.\n\nIf you would like to pursue this approach, you should obviously ask whether\nthe sponsor is happy to do this. Some sponsors are simply not set up for this\nmethod of dealing with events.\n\nYou should also ask the venue. Some venues will not invoice people other than\nthe primary contact for the event.\n\n# Case Study: The Ubuntu Developer Summit\n\nSo far we have explored a few different types of physical events and the core\norganizational elements that go into them. While many readers of the first\nedition of this book found this content useful, a lot of people asked me to\nshare more about how we organize our Ubuntu Developer Summits. For the\nuninitiated, the UDS events are uniquely focused on getting attendees into a\ncollaborative environment to discuss, debate, and plan the next version of\nUbuntu. We have run a UDS every six months since the beginning of the project\n(Ubuntu releases every six months), and with each event we have iterated and\nimproved on what went before and now have the event down to something of a\nscience.\n\nUnlike other similar events, we have worked hard to squeeze every ounce of\nproductivity out of attendees. Everything from the structure of the schedule,\nto the stewardship of the sessions, note-taking facilities, and room layout\nhas been tweaked and improved to make the event as efficient as possible.\n\nI am now going to take a detailed spin through how we put together a UDS as of\nthe time of this writing. If you are interested in organizing a face-to-face\nevent for your community to decide on plans, much of these lessons learned\nshould be useful to you. The UDS is a large and comprehensive event, but this\napproach can also apply to smaller events; just pick and choose what you feel\nwill work well for your event. Grab a coffee and a slice of pizza, and get\nready to step behind the scenes of a UDS.\n\n## The Ethos of the UDS\n\nThe UDS is the most important event in the Ubuntu calendar. It happens at the\nbeginning of a new six-month Ubuntu release cycle, and the goal of the event\nis to bring together the cream of the crop in the Ubuntu community to discuss,\ndebate, and lay down plans for what we are going to do for the next release of\nUbuntu.\n\nImportantly, the UDS is not a conference. It is very much a work summit; a\ncollection of meetings in which attendees have the luxury of being together in\nthe same room (most of us communicate and collaborate online), and there is a\nfirm expectation that the week will result in a concrete set of plans for what\nwe will do in the next release of Ubuntu.\n\nWhile the UDS has certainly grown over the years, the ethos and goals of the\nevent have not. These goals are:\n\nA get-things-done environment\n\n    \n\nWe always want the UDS to be an environment which, while hectic and\nexhausting, gives our attendees a great sense of accomplishment when the event\nis completed. We have actively built an atmosphere in which we judge success\nbased on concrete output.\n\nFirm output\n\n    \n\nHow many of you have been to a conference or event and didn’t feel like you\ngot a lot done, other than networking? At each UDS we work hard so that\neveryone leaves the event with concrete plans and goals for the next release.\nTo many attendees no output means no success in a session.\n\nOptimized for collaboration\n\n    \n\nWhile _optimized for collaboration_ sounds like a horrible buzz phrase, we\nreally have tried to ensure that every session at each UDS is fine-tuned to\nhelp people inside and outside the room participate as effectively as\npossible.\n\nOpen to all\n\n    \n\nThe UDS has always been an event. While Canonical (the commercial sponsor of\nUbuntu) has always driven the content of each UDS and sent many staff and\ncommunity members, we have always encouraged open participation from the\npublic. Importantly, a core part of this ethos is in welcoming remote\nparticipants who can take part online.\n\nAwesome work and play\n\n    \n\nWhile the UDS is an intense and hectic work environment, we have also worked\nhard to make it an inherently social event, and to help reconnect and create\nnew social bonds among our community members. Our goal is that our attendees\nleave with a strong sense of accomplishment of the work they achieved as well\nas with a full complement of new friends and colleagues.\n\nWhile we run each UDS every six months, we have never rested in assuming that\nthe current formula is perfect. Quite the opposite; we almost get close to a\n“It ain’t broke, so why are we trying to fix it?” atmosphere at times. But\nafter each event, we always conduct a survey to gather feedback on the event,\nassess how well it went, perform a stakeholder review, and make appropriate\nchanges where it makes sense.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe UDS has a fairly simple structure for attendees. The event lasts a week,\nfrom Monday to Friday, and each day is broken into a series of (approximately)\none-hour sessions. The venue has 14 meeting rooms available, and thus 14\nsessions can occur at any one time. With so many types of discussions split\nacross so many sessions, we have a series of _tracks_ that represent different\nthemes of discussion. Examples of tracks include _Desktop, Server, Community,\nKernel_ , and _Design_. Each track has a track lead who coordinates the\nsessions for her respective track.\n\nThroughout the venue, we have TV screens displaying the schedule and the\nattendees choose which session they want to attend at the beginning of each\ntime slot. Each session covers a specific topic and the attendees discuss\nplans for that topic. As an example, a session may be how to _grow the number\nof Ubuntu translators_ and the attendees will share and discuss ideas for how\nto accomplish this goal. Then, near the end of the session, the session leader\nwill jot down a set of work items that the attendees agreed to.\n\nThat is the basic gist of how a UDS works. Let’s now delve into the details of\nhow the event is put together, along with many of the subtle decisions we have\nmade over the years that have helped the event become what it is today.\nBelieve me, folks, you have no idea how much blood, sweat, and tears have gone\ninto this damn event; I hope you can all get some value from reading about how\nit has evolved.\n\n## The Organizational Team\n\nThe UDS has become a significant event with many different organizational\nattributes as well as a number of stakeholders. Over the years one of the\nimportant lessons we have learned is to make sure we have a clear idea of who\nis looking after different parts of the event and who is responsible for\ngetting input from different stakeholders who have needs that must be met at\nthe event. Before we take a look at how the organizational team is divided up,\nlet’s look at who these stakeholders are.\n\nThe UDS is almost entirely funded by Canonical, the commercial sponsor behind\nUbuntu. As such, some members of Canonical have specific requirements that we\nmust meet. In addition to this, there are other investors in the event as well\nas those who have a significant level of editorial influence and impact on the\nevent. The following list is a broad approximation of these stakeholders (in\nno particular order):\n\nCEO\n\n    \n\nMost of the requirements coming from the Canonical CEO are attuned to the\nefficiency and return on investment in the event. Fortunately, in terms of\neditorial direction, our CEO does not impose any unrealistic or unreasonable\nexpectations.\n\nFounder\n\n    \n\nSimilarly for Canonical’s founder and head of Product Strategy; his primary\ninput is in ensuring that the event is a productive and worthwhile experience.\nAgain, our founder rarely imposes any unrealistic or unreasonable\nexpectations.\n\nDirector of Ubuntu engineering\n\n    \n\nThe director of Ubuntu engineering typically has few requirements for the\nevent other than ensuring that a core set of goals and requirements for the\nforthcoming release have good airtime and focus at the event.\n\nEngineering managers\n\n    \n\nThe Ubuntu engineering managers (I am part of this team) make up the bulk of\nthe track leads at the event. Their primary requirements are to be able to\nschedule and deliver sessions effectively.\n\nCommunity\n\n    \n\nOf course, there is the wider community who have a clear set of ideas and\nrequests for how the UDS operates. While the community has no operational\nresponsibility to deliver on these requirements (unlike the needs of the CEO,\nfounder etc.), I still consider the community to be an important stakeholder\nas the event attracts many community attendees. Our community rarely has any\nspecific requirements, but often presents many great and some not-so-great\nideas.\n\nSponsors\n\n    \n\nFinally, with each UDS we have some sponsors who assume responsibility for\nspecific parts of the event. These requirements are typically localized to the\narea they are sponsoring, and the UDS sponsorship opportunities provide\nsuitable borders around what the sponsors can and can’t expect to influence.\n\nWith a clear idea of the stakeholders involved, we can also segment the\ndifferent types of organizational responsibility and assign these areas to\nspecific people. In the case of the UDS, these are the different segments of\nwork:\n\nVenue\n\n    \n\nThis is everything to do with the venue: requesting meeting space, liaising\nwith the venue staff, communicating requirements to the venue, handling the\ncaterers, ensuring that accessibility needs are met, reviewing the room\nlayout, ensuring that the right number of tables/chairs are sourced, and so\non.\n\nAssets\n\n    \n\nThese are all the materials you need to run the event. This includes\norganizing banners, badges, t-shirts, signs, sponsorship logos, and so on.\nThis work also involves liaising with designers to produce the necessary\nartwork to go on these materials, and ensuring that the art is ready in time\nso that the materials can be produced in time for the event.\n\nScheduling and content\n\n    \n\nThis involves coordinating the sessions, opening keynotes, wrap-up sessions,\nplenaries, group photos, and other schedule-related content. This job also\ninvolves ensuring that we have the schedule available for everyone to access,\nthat track leads can schedule their content, and that changes can be made to\nthe schedule.\n\nInfrastructure\n\n    \n\nThis is the networking, audio/video facilities, projection, and other\nmachinery that allows attendees to get online, provide presentations, and meet\nother needs. Importantly for the UDS, this also includes ensuring that remote\nparticipants can take part in the sessions, so this involves streaming audio\nfrom all the rooms, providing online streams that people can connect to, and\nproviding IRC channels for each room so that remote participants can\ncommunicate with the session.\n\nAttendees\n\n    \n\nThis is everything to do with getting attendees to the event and ensuring that\nthey have what they need to participate. For the UDS this involves not only\nproviding suitable travel details, but also ensuring that attendees have rooms\nand roomies, dealing with visas, handling last-minute travel snafus, and\nhandling other logistical components.\n\nSponsorship\n\n    \n\nThis involves finding companies to sponsor different parts of the UDS and\neffectively representing these sponsors at the event. This job also involves\nsetting expectations effectively and handling sponsor requirements where\nappropriate.\n\nFor each area a member of the team is assigned to deliver on that specific\narea. That person’s responsibility is to ensure that the stakeholder’s needs\nare sufficiently met and that everything is in place for the event regarding\nthat area. As an example, the person who is coordinating the infrastructure\nside of the event can reasonably assume the other areas are handled and just\nfocus on the infrastructure component.\n\nMy responsibility in this mix is to manage these different pieces. I tend to\nliaise with each person assigned to these areas and help them to unblock\nissues and ensure that everything is on track. I also provide a decision-\nmaking function when stakeholders are either not interested or have no opinion\nin a given decision point.\n\n### Organizational cadence\n\nAs you can see, with such a major event to coordinate and a comprehensive\norganizational team to manage, the potential for something going arse-up is\npretty significant. As such, we put together a regular cadence of discussions\nin the buildup to the event.\n\nIn the first month after the previous event we send out a survey to gather\ninput and feedback on the event to help us guide our next event forward. When\nthis survey is completed I review the content and formulate the results into a\nslide deck that I share with many of our key stakeholders. For each piece of\nfeedback (and particularly for areas of concern or focus), I present some\nrecommendations for improvements or changes.\n\nShortly after I send out the deck, I coordinate a call with these stakeholders\nto run through the deck and jot down requirements, decisions, or areas of\ndiscussion. The goal of this call is to swiftly gather feedback and keep the\ngroup focused on making decisions around the points raised. If this call is\nsuccessful (that can be a big “if” sometimes), I will have a bullet-point list\nof changes or areas of renewed focus. I then share these finalized conclusions\nwith the group.\n\nAt this point the venue coordinator either has picked out a new venue or is\nlooking to source a venue. During the following few months there is not a lot\nto do in terms of UDS coordination; so we reconvene with a regular set of\nstakeholder calls with people more specific to the strategic direction of the\nevent (in other words, this doesn’t usually include the CEO and founder, but\ndoes involve the director of Ubuntu engineering, venue coordinator, and me).\nThese calls happen every two weeks as we nail down further strategic changes\nto the event.\n\nIn the six weeks or so building up to the event, we start a weekly cadence of\norganizational calls. These calls typically involve most of the\nrepresentatives of the areas discussed earlier (venue, assets, infrastructure,\netc.). In these we start nailing down many of the organizational details of\nthe event.\n\nDuring this time, I work to keep an overview of the organizational process and\ntry to unblock areas, particularly unclear requirements from stakeholders.\nEven outside of the regular cadence of meetings there is a regular stream of\ncommunication within the organizational team. The UDS is genuinely a team\neffort, and the culture of being able to assume that a given organizational\nlead had her respective area covered helps to make the entire team successful.\n\n## The Venue\n\nThe UDS is an unusual event for many different reasons. First, it is a heavily\noptimized collaborative event; second, it takes place every six months (which\nis unusual for an event of this size); and third, each UDS often takes place\nin a different location.\n\nIn my time working at Canonical, the UDS has taken me around the world. I have\nbeen to Budapest, Seville, Boston, Orlando, California, Prague, Barcelona,\nBrussels, Dallas, and elsewhere. Traditionally, the UDS would alternate\nbetween the United States and Europe. Alternating between these different\ncountries was useful not only for growing my collection of souvenir\nrefrigerator magnets; because the UDS is an open event, it enabled people in\nthose regions to join us, thus diversifying the attendance at the event.\n\nAs the UDS has increased in size, though, choosing a venue has become more\ncomplex. Finding a venue that can house around 500 attendees and provide the\nfacilities we need has edged the UDS into large-conference territory, and many\nsuch facilities are booked two years in advance. In addition to this, the UDS\nhas become a far more complex event to organize with significant requirements,\nparticularly in terms of infrastructure, audio/video, and assets. Five years\nago, all we required was a projector and a few wireless access points. Today,\nwe require a huge room filled with flight cases jammed with infrastructure.\n\nBecause of these complexities, the UDS tends to take place at previously\nvisited venues these days. This allows us to book a venue before another\nconference gets in there first, and it provides a known target, which is\nparticularly useful for the infrastructure and venue relations side of the\norganizational work.\n\nI am now going to take a spin through some of the considerations we make when\nchoosing a venue. These considerations apply for pretty much all venue sizes,\nso if you are organizing a smaller community conference, these should be\nuseful pointers for you to think about.\n\n### Meeting room requirements\n\nThe UDS is a pretty big event. While around 500 attendees may not seem huge,\nthe focus of the event is to get these attendees into a regular stream of\ndiverse yet manageable sessions. Over the years part of the challenge involved\ndetermining the ideal number of concurrent sessions that we want running at\nthe event. On the one hand, we want to provide plenty of space for people to\nhave sessions, but on the other hand, we don’t want empty rooms or rooms\nfilled to overflowing.\n\nThrough trial and error, surveys, feedback, and a certain amount of alchemy,\nwe have determined that we need around 10 rooms for the event. Some UDS events\nwe have also aligned with another event (such as the Linaro Connect summit),\nand we have upgraded the concurrent room list to 14 rooms.\n\nFourteen rooms is not the end of the story, though. We also need a plenary\nroom that is large enough to hold 500 attendees, and at least 4 rooms that we\ncan use for scheduling private meetings. In addition, we typically need an\noffice room, an audio/video crew setup room, and the usual facilities that go\nwith these needs, such as restrooms, disabled access ramps, sufficient\nventilation, air conditioning, and so on.\n\nThe private meeting rooms are simple to coordinate, and so is the plenary\nroom; ensure that the latter can accommodate the number of attendees and have\nroom for a main stage, as well as projector screens halfway up the room so\nthat people at the back can see.\n\nThe meeting rooms are a little more complex, though, as some sessions will\nhave very few participants, while others will be very popular; I have seen\nsome sessions have only 2 people in them and others have over 100. As such, I\nalways recommend that we find a range of meeting room sizes and that we try to\nensure that most can seat at least 50 attendees (30–50 attendees seems to be\nthe average size of a UDS session).\n\nSocial events are another consideration. At each UDS we typically have a meet-\nand-greet buffet on the Monday evening and a closing party on the Friday\nnight. It is impractical to have these events in the plenary room as that\nwould require setup and breakdown for the usual day-to-day plenary facilities.\nAs such, our venue requirements also include a room where we can have a social\nfunction for around 500 guests.\n\nThis also gets more complex when you have sponsors who want to organize their\nown social events; typically they won’t want all social events to take place\nin the same room each night. As such, a venue with multiple social event\nlocations is a great find. Of course, you could host social events off-site,\nbut organizing buses is a pain, and buses impact the social structure of the\nevent; if the last bus leaves at 9:30 p.m. and you are having a great time,\nthe event is cut off prematurely.\n\nWhen you have an idea of your meeting room requirements you should consolidate\nthese into a document that you can send to potential venues to see if they\nmeet your needs.\n\n### Location\n\nLocation, location, location, baby! This is what toadying real estate agents\ntell us all the time, but exactly the same applies to choosing a great venue\nfor your event.\n\nLocation choice is a delicate balance. On the one hand, you want to pick a\nfun, interesting, and desirable location, but on the other hand, you don’t\nwant your attendees to spend their time out and about, soaking up the\nlocation, and not actually participating in your event.\n\nThis choice is more complex for smaller events where you have a wider set of\noptions available for venues. If you are hosting an event for 100 people and\nneed 3 or 4 rooms, you can pretty much hold that event anywhere; there are\nplenty of venues that meet your needs. For an event such as a UDS with its\nextensive meeting room and space requirements, our options are considerably\nmore limited.\n\nThe simple reality is that there just aren’t that many venues that can support\na UDS’s requirements, and as such, it makes the location list a pretty\nstraightforward choice between a limited set of options.\n\nWhile I am not actively involved in the choice of venue or location for the\nUDS, I have worked with the team that is, and these are some of the\nconsiderations they make based on location:\n\nSafety\n\n    \n\nSafety is the first and primary consideration. You should always check to see\nif there is any political or civil unrest in the area where your event will\ntake place, and check how safe the neighborhood is. The last thing you want is\nan incident occurring at the event and putting anyone in harm’s way.\n\nTravel\n\n    \n\nSome locations are just intrinsically easier to get to. The UDS attracts\npeople from all over the world, and many, many people must hop on a plane in\norder to attend. As such, good travel links, and importantly, ensuring that\npeople can get there without too many flight connections, is an important\nattribute to check. More flight connections mean more uncomfortable travel and\nmore opportunity for things to go wrong (canceled/delayed flights). You should\nalso assess how far the venue is from the local airport/train station/bus\nlink; if you are allowing people to expense their taxis to the venue, it all\nadds up.\n\nSocial opportunities\n\n    \n\nThe social opportunities in the area are important to consider. Some locations\ncan offer too few (e.g., we once had a UDS in the middle of a Belgian forest\nwith nothing to do, and things started getting a little like _Lord of the\nFlies_ after a few weeks), while others can offer too many (e.g., I am pretty\nsure there will never be a UDS in Las Vegas). From my experience, most people\nwant a few decent dinner options within walking distance, a cheap bar nearby\nwhere they can socialize, and if possible, a convenience store to buy\nforgotten toothbrushes and deodorant.\n\nDesirability\n\n    \n\nPicking an interesting location can often significantly increase the chances\nof people attending the event and tacking a few days before or after the event\nfor some vacation time. I have seen this in past years when the UDS has taken\nplace in Florida, Prague, and California.\n\nLocal opportunities\n\n    \n\nAnother consideration, particularly for commercial investors in the community,\nis to identify local opportunities that can be connected to an event. A good\nexample of this for a technology company would be to have an event near\nSilicon Valley in California; you could then use the event as a means to\nattract companies and representatives to meetings. This is something we\nsometimes consider for the UDS.\n\nOf course, an important consideration in all of this is cost. With the UDS we\nknow the venue costs will be significant due to the size of the event, and we\nalso factor in the cost of the local amenities. As an example, Las Vegas and\nthe San Francisco Bay Area are pretty expensive areas, but Eastern Europe is\nmuch cheaper.\n\nInstead of looking for a clear-cut solution in each case, try to find a\nbalance. You may find a venue that is inexpensive but in an area that doesn’t\noffer much in terms of socializing, or you might find a venue that is more\nexpensive but is convenient in terms of travel and offers lots of fun things\nto do. Try not to obsess over the small details, and instead pick the best\noption based on the attributes that are important to you.\n\n### Facilities\n\nWith the growth of the UDS, our facilities requirements have grown\nsignificantly, too. These include your requirements outside the core\nrequirements of the event.\n\nFor the UDS, we have to ensure that the location provides what we need to hold\nthe event as well as provides accommodation for our attendees. While we have\nsometimes provided bus services between area hotels and the UDS venue, this is\na logistical challenge and so we tend to prefer to hold the UDS in a hotel\nthat can also provide accommodation to attendees. This makes life a lot\nsimpler.\n\nIn terms of accommodation, we ask attendees who are sponsored or who work for\nCanonical to share a room, and we have a reasonable idea of the number of\ndouble rooms that are required. We also try to ensure that there are good\ncatering facilities at the hotel (for breakfast) and at the meeting venue (for\nlunch). In addition, we try to make sure we can offer other niceties such as\nInternet in the rooms, a gym, and a decent hotel bar that is not too expensive\nwhere people can socialize in the evenings.\n\nBe a little cautious when booking blocks of hotel rooms. Most venues will ask\nyou to block off a certain number of rooms (e.g., 100 rooms) and possibly pay\na deposit. If you have a firm idea of how many people are attending (as we do\nwith the UDS), it is safe to book that block. If you are unsure how many\npeople will attend your event, be careful when estimating the number of rooms\nto block; many folks who say they will go will not show up.\n\nWhile we have a firm idea of the required number of rooms for the UDS and we\nwork to ensure that we get a good rate on them, we also try to ensure that\npeople who are attending of their own accord can get a discounted rate. Talk\nwith the hotel to see if these attendees can get a discounted rate; the hotel\nshould be able to offer you something, particularly if you are already\nbringing a substantial chunk of business their way.\n\nIt is recommended that you produce a list of requirements that you can present\nto potential venues, particularly if you are booking both meeting space and\nhotel accommodations.\n\nCreating an Accessible Event\n\nWe have always worked hard to help the UDS to be as accessible as possible.\nMaking an event accessible often requires some trial and error so that you\nlearn which are the important accessibility requirements to put in place.\n\nOf course, an obvious requirement is that the venue is handicap-accessible.\nSubtler items that can sometimes be forgotten include ensuring that your buses\nare wheelchair-accessible, ensuring that signs are large enough for those with\nvision problems to read, not creating signs that are unreadable for those with\ncolorblindness, and ensuring that you provide other options for those with\nparticular dietary requirements.\n\nA great way to develop this experience is to reach out to attendees with\naccessibility needs and ask them for their feedback on what can be improved\nfor each event; before long you will have a clear idea of what areas you need\nto focus on.\n\n## Assets\n\nFor every UDS a large number of assets need to be produced as part of the\nevent. These assets are used to decorate the venue, provide useful information\nto attendees, and meet other needs. These assets include the following:\n\nHangable banners\n\n    \n\nWe usually hang some large Ubuntu banners outside the venue to indicate where\nthe event is, as well as in other parts of the venue (such as behind the\nregistration desk). These are usually vinyl banners that don’t include\nspecific event information on them, so they can be used at multiple events.\n\nPop-up banners\n\n    \n\nWe also have a series of pop-up banners that provide information specific to\nthe event. These include banners with event-specific details such as the\nrelease name and logo, as well as banners for social and other events. These\npop-up banners cannot be reused for future events due to their event-specific\ncontent.\n\nBadges\n\n    \n\nTraditionally we used to just print badges with the name and IRC nickname of\nthe attendee. These badges would be provided with an Ubuntu-branded lanyard to\ngo around the attendee’s neck. These days we use a more comprehensive foldable\nbadge that includes other information, such as a map of the venue, key web\naddresses, social event start times and rooms, and other content. This\nfoldable badge includes this information inside the folds, with the attendee’s\nname and nickname appearing on the outside of the badge. While they are more\nexpensive, we have found these badges to be really useful. Another, more\nrecent change is getting lanyards made for each UDS so that we can include the\nsponsor’s logo.\n\nSigns\n\n    \n\nWhile an important asset, general signage can be created on-site with a\nprinter. These are just basic signs that hang on meeting room doors and\nindicate session names and times, general information, new information, and\nmore. A ream of paper, a printer, and a branding-compliant template are all\nyou need to make the sign love happen.\n\nT-shirts\n\n    \n\nWe also produce a few different types of t-shirts for the event. First, we\ncreate a t-shirt design for each track lead. As an example, when I lead the\nCommunity track, my t-shirt has the usual event branding as well as\n“COMMUNITY” written on the back of the shirt (the other tracks have their\ntrack names on the back of their shirts). We give each track lead five\nt-shirts (one for each day). We also have a set of crew t-shirts made for\ncommunity crew volunteers, and a set of t-shirts made for general distribution\nso that all attendees get to take a t-shirt home with them. For the former two\n(track leads and crew) we can get specific size requirements, but for the\nlatter (general attendance t-shirts) we just make them available in a range of\nsizes. Be sure to get shirts that go up to XXL.\n\nWhile these may seem fairly straightforward items to put together, remember\nthat a chain of events needs to occur to produce these items. A design needs\nto be created and approved, the design needs to be sent to the producer, and\nthe items need to be produced and then shipped to the venue. My advice is to\nget the design completed and approved ASAP; design requirements often get\ndelayed and can cause headaches in terms of getting assets produced in time.\n\nThere are, of course, some other little bits and pieces you should have\ntogether for your event. These include things such as stationery for the\nregistration desk, and any assets required by sponsors for the social events\nand other areas (such as signs next to sponsored coffee or lunch breaks). I\nrecommend you create a list that you can refer to for each event so that you\nwon’t forget anything.\n\nFinally, even if you don’t need them, I recommend you place a few whiteboards\nnext to the registration desk. These boards are useful for adding late-\nbreaking information and changes to the event or sessions.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure is a critical part of each UDS. The infrastructure is a\ncollection of tools and facilities that help our attendees work effectively.\nWe can reasonably break this down into infrastructure required by on-site\nattendees as well as infrastructure required by remote participants.\n\nFor on-site attendees this includes things such as the event network\n(providing general access to the Internet), television screens displaying the\nschedule so that people can see which session to go to next, projection\nequipment in each meeting room, projection equipment in the main plenary room\n(and additional chained projectors so that people at the back can see, too),\nas well as local mirrors of some important Ubuntu archives so that the\nInternet is not getting hit constantly.\n\nAnother important piece of infrastructure that is provided are video recording\nfacilities. We don’t videotape every session (there are too many of them), but\nwe do allow track leads to select which sessions must be videotaped, and our\ncrew (which is composed of sponsored attendees who volunteer) ensures that the\ncameras are switched on and videotape these important sessions. Our A/V crew\nthen encodes these session videos and puts them on YouTube so that the wider\ncommunity can access them.\n\nThe flip side of the on-site infrastructure is the remote participation\ninfrastructure. A core value we have always held at the UDS is that we should\nmake it possible for attendees who can’t attend physically to participate in\nthe sessions. We achieve this by ensuring that every room has microphones at\nthe front. The room is laid out in a special fishbowl layout (which we will\ndiscuss shortly) that helps to ensure that the main speakers are near the\nmicrophones. These microphones stream the audio from the room live out to the\nInternet and anyone is able to listen in on the session.\n\nIn addition to this, there is a projector in every room that displays a chat\nroom that remote participants can communicate with. This provides an effective\nway to hear the conversation but to reply via a chat channel (we did try to do\na two-way chat some time ago, but it didn’t work out and just created a bunch\nof awkward silences).\n\n### Note\n\nIf you have audio/video streaming from your meeting rooms, be sure to remind\npeople to not have private conversations in there. We had a particularly\namusing case a few years back when an attendee wandered into a room during a\nbreak at a UDS and had a blazing row with his wife while it was being streamed\nonline. Fortunately, a member of the staff noticed this within a heartbeat and\ncut the feedback so that the attendee and his wife could argue in privacy.\n\n## Room Layout\n\nYou would imagine that the layout of a meeting room is pretty straightforward,\nright? Well, it can be quite complex. As an example, how many chairs to do\nwant in there? What sort of layout do you want—theater-style, classroom, or\nmeeting? Do you want tables in there, and if so, what kind of tables? What\nother facilities do you want in there? How many projectors?\n\nThe room layout of a UDS is something we have iterated on significantly over\nthe years, and I believe we have determined what is probably the most\nefficient layout possible. It looks like [Figure\n12-1](ch12.html#fishbowl_layout \"Figure 12-1. The UDS meeting room layout is\ndesigned to ensure that the primary participants are close to one another and\nto the projectors and microphones.\").\n\n![The UDS meeting room layout is designed to ensure that the primary\nparticipants are close to one another and to the projectors and\nmicrophones.](httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1159269.png)\n\nFigure 12-1. The UDS meeting room layout is designed to ensure that the\nprimary participants are close to one another and to the projectors and\nmicrophones.\n\nAt the front of the room you can see two projector screens. The one on the\nleft shows the chat room that is set up for that particular room. When remote\nparticipants look at the schedule and decide to join a session, they can join\nthe chat room for that room and then communicate with the room. We always\nencourage session leaders and attendees in general to keep an eye open for\ncontributions in the chat room, and this has generally worked pretty well.\n\nThe other projector is for general use. Many people plug their laptops into\nthis projector to show web pages, create agendas, perform demos, or just show\nthe current set of notes.\n\nBetween the projectors are two microphones (illustrated in the figure as the\nconnected circles). These microphones point to different sides of the room,\nand pick up the general discussion in the room and stream this online for the\nremote participants.\n\nEach square shown in the figure represents a chair in the room. This layout is\ncalled a _fishbowl_ and is designed to get the primary participants in the\nmeeting to sit closer together. The idea is simple: those people participating\nmost in the session are encouraged to sit closer to the front of the room, and\nthose who are mainly listening or occasionally participating are encouraged to\nsit near the back.\n\nThis format has a few distinct benefits:\n\nGood for remote participants\n\n    \n\nOne of the most frustrating experiences for a remote participant is when he\ncan’t hear people in the room speaking because they are too far away from the\nmicrophones. The fishbowl approach, by definition, asks active speakers to sit\ncloser to the front, which is closer to the microphones that stream the\ncontent to remote participants. This makes it much easier to hear what is\ngoing on.\n\nEasy access to projectors\n\n    \n\nTypically, active speakers in a session may want to use the projectors, either\nby referencing contributions from the chat room or by plugging their laptop\ninto the general projector to show content or take notes. Sitting these active\nspeakers closer to the front makes the projectors more conveniently available.\n\nLess bending and twisting\n\n    \n\nIf you don’t have a fishbowl layout and active speakers are scattered around\nthe room, attendees may have to bend and twist their bodies to see who is\nspeaking and to participate in the discussion. If these active speakers are at\nthe front of the room they are closer to one another and everyone else just\nneeds to face forward. This reduces the strain and pain that can build up when\nyou are bending and twisting all day in sessions.\n\nAn important point about using the fishbowl is that you need to enforce it; if\nsomeone is actively participating, be sure to ask her to move to the front so\nthat she can be part of the fishbowl. You should also try to keep some space\nopen near the front so that participants in wheelchairs can be closer to the\nfront of the fishbowl.\n\n## The Timetable\n\nAt the core of the UDS is the timetable; an intricate tapestry of meetings\ndesigned to debate, discuss, and disseminate information. Let’s take a quick\nlook at the different types of content that are on the schedule.\n\n### Opening keynotes\n\nThe first hour of the event, on Monday at 9 a.m., is devoted to the opening\nkeynotes. During this hour we welcome people to the UDS and explain how it\nworks, and a couple of visionary keynote speakers then take the stage to set\nthe scene for the event.\n\nI usually spend the first 15 minutes of this hour welcoming people and\nexplaining how the event works. This is always a difficult presentation for me\nbecause many folks in the audience hear this presentation every six months and\nI don’t want to bore them, but folks who are new to the UDS need the\ninformation being presented. I have found that keeping the presentation to 15\nminutes prevents returning attendees from getting bored while providing new\nattendees the information they need to make the event successful.\n\nMy presentation touches on many things that you may want to cover at your own\nevents:\n\n  * Welcome people to the event and explain how much of a thrill it is to have them there\n\n  * Briefly celebrate the new release and then focus people on the upcoming release and what we are working toward\n\n  * Revisit the ethos of Ubuntu and how we are all here to further our mission\n\n  * Introduce many of the different groups in the room by asking them to stand up and be acknowledged\n\n  * Explain the schedule, where to find it, and how it works\n\n  * Explain how a session works, how to run one, and how to get the most out of it\n\n  * Show how people take notes and jot down work items\n\n  * Cover the different social events going on throughout the week\n\n  * Remind people to keep an eye on their things and not to leave laptops in the rooms\n\n  * Ask people to not drink, eat, work, or play too much\n\nAfter these introductory points I hand things over to the individual keynote\nspeakers. At the UDS we always have at least one keynote speaker, and usually\ntwo. I typically allocate 20 minutes for each keynote speaker, but they always\nrun the risk of going over that time limit. Be sure to provide a clock and\nremind your speakers to keep their presentations to 20 minutes. You should\nalso sit in the front row and discreetly let them know when they need to wrap\nit up; you don’t want to have the keynotes eat into the first set of\ndiscussion sessions.\n\n### Plenaries\n\nThe UDS used to follow a purely session-driven schedule. We would kick things\noff at 9 a.m., start running through the sessions, and then wrap up at 6 p.m.\neach day. While this was productive, it also gave us a problem: how do we\naugment these great discussions with information regarding what is going on in\nthe community? There was always so much cool work going on, and we felt it\ncould be awesome to have a way to share this work with the wider audience.\n\nAnd thus plenaries were born. Each day at 2 p.m. we begin an hour of 15-minute\nplenary sessions that take place in the main auditorium where the kickoff\nsession took place.\n\nWe invite everyone to participate in the plenaries; as such, they often\nconsist of a mix of tech demos, summaries of in-process work, and sponsor\npresentations. Importantly, for the sponsor presentations we disallow\nmarketing pitches; they have to be of genuine interest to the audience.\n\nThese plenary sessions get booked up incredibly quickly and have been very\npopular with UDS attendees. I recommend you have similar sessions at your\nevents.\n\n### Lightning talks\n\nSomething we tried out a few years ago that has proven to be hugely popular is\nthe _lightning talk_. These are very short (usually not longer than five\nminutes) talks that provide a quick spin around a topic, a short demo, or\nsomething else. Some of the most memorable moments at the UDS have been topics\nand demos shown in the lightning talks session.\n\nWe always host the lightning talks on Friday afternoon because people are\nusually pretty burned out at that point and it is easier to keep their\nattention with a collection of short talks.\n\nThe most important thing when running lightning talks is to stick to the time\nslot for each talk. You will want an energetic moderator who is not afraid to\nboot people off when their time is up. We usually have lightning talk speakers\nline up in a row next to the stage so that they can be ushered on one by one.\n\nIf you want to allow people to use slides, make sure you provide a projector\nwith multiple inputs. This way, while someone is speaking, you can ask the\nnext person to get her laptop plugged in and ready to go. You want to avoid\nwasting time setting up equipment.\n\nLightning talks are always really popular at the UDS and other events, and I\nrecommend that you have such a session at your own events.\n\n### Sessions\n\nSessions are the meat and potatoes of a UDS. They provide a tremendous amount\nof face time for a community that is used to communicating online. Sessions\nhave a very clear focus: discuss and debate a topic, and leave the room with a\nclear set of work items to move forward on the topic.\n\nEach session has a leader who coordinates and manages the discussion in the\nroom. It is the session leader’s responsibility to ensure that the topic gets\nplenty of discussion, that everyone gets to participate (not just the loudest\npeople), and that the session remains on topic and on track.\n\nThe quality of the sessions is heavily based on the ability of the session\nleaders to meet these responsibilities, and we work hard to help session\nleaders learn how to run a session as deftly as possible.\n\nWe recommend the following approach:\n\nIntroduce the topic\n\n    \n\nIntroduce the topic of the session and explain any backstory and context\nbehind the session. Invite others to ask questions if they understand the\nfocus of the session.\n\nState the goal\n\n    \n\nWhat do you want to get out of the session? We always want a clear\narticulation of work items for next steps, but what do you want the work items\nto accomplish?\n\nDiscuss the topic\n\n    \n\nAlways be on the lookout for people who are unable to get a word in but want\nto contribute, and also look out for people rambling off-topic and cut them\nshort if required to keep the session focused. Encourage people in the room to\ntake notes.\n\nDefine work items\n\n    \n\nAbout 10 minutes before the end of the session, I always recommend that\nsession leaders cut the conversation short and focus on documenting work\nitems. This is when the session leader should explicitly ask those who\ncontributed if they will be willing to volunteer to handle work items to\nachieve different parts of the goal. Be sure to document these work items.\n\nIf session leaders stick to this formula everyone should feel like they were\nincluded in the session, and you should have some concrete work items that you\ncan focus on after the event.\n\n## Scheduling\n\nWith a good idea of how a UDS is structured, the final piece for us to discuss\nis how sessions are scheduled and put on the timetable that is displayed on\nthe screens throughout the UDS.\n\nI should warn you that the process we use is heavily customized for the UDS\nand does not use an off-the-shelf solution that you can replicate. Everything\nmentioned here does fall in the category of Free Software, though, and you can\npull these pieces together. But even if you don’t use these tools, an\nexplanation of why we do it this way could be useful when putting together\nyour own solution.\n\nWith most events, the scheduling component is separate from the project\nmanagement component. Events are organized, some kind of conference system is\nused in which you can fill in a form to add a session, but then much of the\nwork agreed on at the event is lost in a litany of notes and other random\ncontent. Often there is no implicit connection between the session and the\nwork outlined in the session.\n\nWe built a system for the UDS that helps close this gap.\n\nFor each piece of work that we want to focus on in a new release we ask our\ncommunity to file a blueprint. A blueprint (as discussed in [Structuring Your\nProjects](ch09.html#structuring-your-projects \"Structuring Your Projects\")) is\na web page that reflects the current status of a project. The blueprint also\nprovides a means for people to subscribe to it to see when the project status\nchanges.\n\nWe ask our attendees to file blueprints for all the projects they want to work\non in the next cycle. Each blueprint can be targeted to an upcoming sprint.\nOne of these sprint options is the next UDS.\n\nWhen a blueprint is targeted for a sprint it is added to a queue of blueprints\nto be reviewed for inclusion in the next UDS. Blueprints we approve are\nautomatically scheduled in a system called summit.ubuntu.com. This system is a\ncustom-built scheduling system that reads in all the blueprints and schedules\nthem on the right track based on how they were named (e.g., a blueprint that\nstarts with “community” is added to the _community_ track).\n\nWhen someone subscribes to a blueprint, summit.ubuntu.com identifies that this\nperson should be in the session. People can also mark themselves as\n_participation essential_ for a blueprint. The summit.ubuntu.com system then\nbuilds a schedule based on when everyone can attend the session, prioritizing\nthe sessions by those marked as _participation essential_ for a given session.\nThis approach ensures that we have a fully optimized schedule.\n\nThe scheduling system also includes a feature that prevents people from\ncamping out in rooms and missing out on other sessions they may want to\nattend. We used to manually schedule the UDS and assign rooms to tracks; thus\npeople who would be interested in a track would sometimes set up shop in a\nroom and not leave. This would reduce the level of cross-pollination across\ndifferent tracks. To help with this we added a feature to summit.ubuntu.com to\nnot allow two sessions of the same track to follow on from each other in the\nsame room. This means you will always need to leave the room to move to a\nsession if you want to follow the same track, and it gets people to more\nactively assess different sessions.\n\nThe UDS Sponsorship Process\n\nTo apply for sponsorship you must start by filing an application in the\nsponsorship system. Sponsorship is open to everyone. We also ask the Ubuntu\nEngineering Management team and certain developers at Canonical to make\nrecommendations in the system. The outcome of this process often nets more\nthan 120 names in the system. We usually sponsor around 60 people, so our goal\nis to whittle down the list to those who are likely to bring the most value to\nthe UDS for the goals of that specific release.\n\nThat last bit—\"that specific release”—is important. All UDS attendees bring\nvalue to the event, but given the limited number of people we can sponsor, it\nmakes sense to bring in people who can provide valuable input to the goals and\nfocus of the next release. This is not exclusive: we also prioritize some\nfolks based on recurring value (e.g., governance members, some core-devs,\netc.), but as a rule we focus on that given release, not on Ubuntu in general.\n\nIn our system we provide the ability for engineering managers and key staff\nmembers to vote on applications by assigning each one a number ranging from +3\n(the applicant is considered essential for goals related to that release, and\nbringing huge input and value to sessions) to -3 (there are significant\nconcerns or objections about that person attending, such as worries about not\nattending sessions, wasting time, being disruptive to other attendees, etc.).\n\nThen points are applied based on the following:\n\n  * We give everyone who has never been to a UDS event 1 point. This is because we want to provide an opportunity for new folks to take part in this valuable experience in the Ubuntu community. We also give 1 point to anyone who is an Ubuntu Member, a core-dev, a MOTU member, or a member of a governance board. We preseed these scores because we consider the combination of new blood and acknowledged experience to be a good combination.\n\n  * We ask the Ubuntu Engineering Management team and key staff members to vote for people. They can give candidates a number ranging from +3 to -3, and if they don’t know the candidate the score is left at 0. Rarely do people get negative scores; this typically occurs only in cases when someone is considered extremely disruptive, abusive, a time-waster, or has demonstrated wasteful or disruptive conduct at a previous UDS.\n\nThe scores are aggregated to form a final score (e.g., if two engineering\nmanagers provide a -1 and a +3 the final score will be +2). With this we then\nhave a big list of sponsored attendees in aggregated score order from high to\nlow.\n\nAt this point we have to perform some editorial input on the lower part of the\ngroup. As an example, candidates 45–55 may all have +2 scores, which gives us\n10 slots, but then we might have 20 candidates with +2 scores. At this point I\nwill assess the goals of the release and the needs of the engineering teams\nand shortlist this final 10 in the group to form the final 55 or so. I usually\napprove 55 out of the 60 at this point because there are always engineering\nmanagers who have late-breaking needs that must be satisfied, so I leave a\nbuffer of 5 slots to accommodate these needs.\n\nFinally, the list goes to Mark Shuttleworth who takes a final look and\ntypically makes a few amendments (generally, people he wants to go who are not\non the list) and then the list goes to Marianna, who sends out the\ninvitations.\n\nFor every UDS there are those who are offered sponsorship but who cannot\nattend, so we also have a backup list of people with the next highest scores\nwho we invite to take up the places of those people who can’t join us.\n\nAs you can see it is a pretty fair system. It takes multiple levels of input\nfrom a variety of staff members and favors people if they have not been to a\nUDS before or if they have achieved membership, are governors, or are approved\ndevelopers. I am sure some of you will take issue with the fact that this is\nall Canonical-driven, but remember, this is a Canonical-funded event; the UDS\nis not funded by a foundation or suchlike. In the future, however, I would\nlike to invite the perspectives of some governors on sponsorship applications\nif that makes sense.\n\n# Organizing Online Events\n\nIn recent years the growth of the Internet has produced an increasingly\ninteractive Web. Gone are the days of an Internet largely populated by static\nweb pages. Today the Internet is the same thriving and growing library it ever\nwas; it’s just that now it is a library in which you can talk to the other\nvisitors.\n\nWhen we look back at the history of communities in which people worked\ntogether on the Internet, virtually all communication was handled in two\nenvironments: email or Usenet (groups in which you send email). Both of these\nmedia have always been slow. When you discuss a topic over email, it is\nentirely expected that a conversation can last days or even weeks, with hours\nin between each message.\n\nAlthough email still dominates the world as a primary medium for general\ncommunication online, advances in real-time discussion facilities have made it\npossible to hold real-time meetings in which people converse with one another\nin the same time slot. This has raised the opportunity for online meetings in\nwhich multiple people can join and have a conversation.\n\nOnline events are something that I have used extensively throughout my work\nwith Ubuntu, but it surprises me how little other communities have made use of\nthem. In the Ubuntu community, they have been hugely useful and always netted\nupward of 300 attending each event.\n\nIf you have a geographically dispersed community, here are some of the types\nof online events that could be useful to run:\n\nTutorial weeks\n\n    \n\nThese are special weeks in which a series of teaching and best-practice\nsessions are run to educate your community in how to do things. This has been\nused extensively in the Ubuntu community.\n\nRelease parties\n\n    \n\nMany communities have online release parties to celebrate the release of a new\npiece of software, initiative, or some other project. Instead of meeting in a\nbar or restaurant, these parties happen online in a chat room, and people sit\nat their computers and have a few drinks while having a good time with one\nanother.\n\nFocused activity days\n\n    \n\nThese days are intended to bring the community together around a specific\ninitiative. In the Ubuntu community, these events come in the form of Bug Days\n(designed to focus people on fixing bugs) and Docs Days (designed to focus\npeople on improving the community documentation).\n\nI have not included team meetings in this, as they are less special events and\nmore an expected component in teams and governance bodies. Online events\nrelated to governance and conflict resolution were discussed earlier in the\nchapters devoted to those topics.\n\n## Common Attributes\n\nEarlier, when we explored some of the organizational characteristics behind\nphysical events, we discussed some common elements that apply to all events.\nThis included accommodation, date/time, equipment, and so on. We are now going\nto do the same for online events. The following are the common considerations\nthat apply to all online events.\n\n### Medium\n\nThe first and most important consideration is what medium you want to use to\nhost the event. Each medium that you use will need to be in real time: it is\nthe instant gratification of real-time communication that makes events feel\nlike events.\n\nThese are some of the attributes that you should look for in a medium:\n\nAppropriateness\n\n    \n\nWill the medium meet your needs? As an example, if you are running a training\ncourse for a few hundred people, a voice teleconference is inappropriate\nbecause only one person can talk at a time. However, you might deliver a talk\nand answer questions over a voice connection while accepting questions and\nallowing chat on a text medium.\n\nAccessibility\n\n    \n\nYou should ensure that all of your members can access the medium you choose.\nThis depends a lot on your community. With this consideration, you need to\ndetermine not only whether your community has the technical facilities (e.g.,\ncomputing power and Internet bandwidth) but also whether members are familiar\nwith or able to learn how to access the medium.\n\nValues\n\n    \n\nYou should ensure that the chosen medium meets the values of your community.\nAs an example, if you are part of an open source community that values\nsoftware freedom, you should not choose a medium that is closed source.\n\nWhatever your choice of medium, you should ensure that access to it is well\ndocumented and that your community is fully aware of where to find the\ndocumentation and how to connect.\n\n#### Internet Relay Chat (IRC)\n\nExamples include:\n\n  * [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net/)\n\n  * [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/)\n\nInternet Relay Chat is a simple and efficient medium that is popular in the\ntechnical community. IRC is also open and transparent, and there are free\nclients for all operating systems. Another benefit of IRC is that it can host\nliterally hundreds of participants at the same time, yet is low-bandwidth: it\ndoes not require a fast Internet connection. This is important if your\ncommunity members may be using dial-up Internet access.\n\nIRC has two downsides. First, it is text-only, and some may not find it quite\nso engaging. Second, it is largely unknown in nontechnical communities. As\nsuch, if you decide on IRC for a nontechnical event, you will have to tutor\nyour community on how to use it.\n\nI have found IRC to be an excellent medium for organizing events. I have used\nit for many Ubuntu-related events, such as the Ubuntu Open Week, Ubuntu\nDeveloper Week, LoCo Documentation Days, release parties, and more. While IRC\nis useful, I have always been conscious to remember that most members start\nout unfamiliar with IRC and how to use it. You should always ensure that there\nare nice, clear instructions (with screenshots) showing how to connect with\nIRC.\n\n#### Voice over IP (VoIP)\n\nExamples include:\n\n  * [Skype](http://www.skype.com/)\n\n  * [Ekiga](http://ekiga.org/)\n\nOnline telephony such as Skype or a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) client\nsuch as Ekiga is the equivalent of having a conference call. As such, the same\nbenefits and limitations apply: you can’t practically have more than 5–10\npeople in a conversation, but it does feel engaging. A downside of this medium\nis that it requires (a) a reasonably powerful Internet connection and (b)\nsound hardware and a microphone, which may not be as common as you would\nexpect.\n\nI have found VoIP to be useful for meetings, but not for general-purpose\nevents due to the scaling issues. Another blocker for VoIP is that while Skype\nworks great for many people, other clients require a significant amount of\nfiddling with firewalls and other networking mumbo jumbo to get them working.\nWhen you organize an event, the last thing you want is your attendees fighting\nwith the tools they need to connect.\n\n#### Virtual worlds\n\nOne example is:\n\n  * [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/)\n\nThese 3D environments offer an interesting possibility for events. The largest\nand most popular is Second Life, which has literally thousands of people\nonline.\n\nVirtual worlds offer an interesting physicality to an event. Second Life, for\nexample, has hosted many events inside its environment, including gatherings,\nconcerns, book readings, presentations, and more. In a virtual world, you have\na physical avatar that you can move around in the world. While there, you can\ntext or voice-chat with other in-world avatars, buy and sell items, and create\nbuildings and other things.\n\nA particularly interesting feature with the voice chat in Second Life is\nspatial sound, in which the location of the sound in the stereo field changes\nbased on where the person is. As an example, if you sit between two people in\na discussion, the person on the left will come out of the left speaker more.\n\nVirtual worlds do, however, require significant computing resources to use\n(high-powered graphics card and audio hardware, significant Internet\nbandwidth) and also a good knowledge of how to use the world, navigate, and\ncommunicate with people. Although clients such as Second Life seem like an\nexciting bridge between the real and the online world, you should ensure that\nthey don’t block accessibility for your community. If the majority of your\ncommunity can use Second Life, great, but if many struggle to meet the\nrequirements, choose a different medium.\n\n### Date/time\n\nWhen choosing an event date and time, be conscious that you are potentially\nopen to a worldwide audience. As such, you are faced with the complex task of\npicking a time that will suit most of your likely attendees.\n\nHere you need to take a reasonable survey of where most of your attendees live\nin the world and what times are going to be suitable for the majority. You are\nnever going to make everyone happy all the time, and some people will complain\nbecause they won’t be able to attend.\n\nA common approach I have used is to pick a time that is in the afternoon in\nEurope. As an example, with Ubuntu Open Week (a week of tutorial sessions), I\nensure that each day there are only four or five hours of available sessions\nbut that they are spread throughout the week during European afternoon hours.\nThis ensures that the West Coast of the United States can get online early in\nthe morning, while on the East Coast of the US it is midday, and in Asia and\nbeyond it is later at night. This approach has helped our events to hit the\nmost people within the worldwide spread of contributors that are involved in\nthe Ubuntu community.\n\nAnother complexity in picking times is communicating the time. There are many\nways of describing different times, such as Pacific Time, Central Time,\nEastern Time, Greenwich Mean Time, and Central European Time. Daylight saving\nvariations make it even more complicated. Fortunately, there is a solution to\nthis in the form of Coordinated Universal Time and its ludicrously jumbled\nacronym, UTC.\n\nWhen everyone uses UTC, people can calculate their local time zone offset\nbased on the difference between UTC and their local zone. Although many people\nare still unaware of what UTC is, I highly recommend that you use it: it is\nbecoming a more common reference as more communities have online events. When\nusing UTC, it is recommended that you still add other time zones next to the\nstatement, for example, “Our next meeting will take place at 9 p.m. UTC (10\np.m. London, 2 p.m. San Francisco, 5 p.m. New York).”\n\n### Note\n\nI highly recommend sending out a reminder two hours before the event via\nemail, your website, Twitter, identi.ca, and so on, to remind people that the\nmeeting is happening soon. This will help remind people of the time and reduce\ntime zone confusion.\n\n## Online Discussion Meetings\n\nCommunication within your community should always be your top priority. When\nthe communication channels are open and conversation flows freely, your\ncommunity gains momentum, progress is made, and your members will feel\nengaged.\n\nInternal communication should seek to satisfy a range of needs that are\ninvolved in running a successful community. These needs are oriented around\ncommunicating progress on your goals, identifying direction, regular social\nconnections, and day-to-day discussion.\n\nMeetings are a key component in ensuring that your community is running\neffectively. They provide a number of opportunities:\n\nDiscuss progress\n\n    \n\nWith your strategic plan and road map in place, you can use meetings as an\nopportunity to communicate progress on OBJECTIVES, GOALS, and ACTIONS.\n\nDiscuss solutions\n\n    \n\nMeetings are a chance to discuss the implementation of solutions and any\nproblems that your community may have.\n\nAssign tasks\n\n    \n\nMeetings are useful for identifying what needs to be done and getting people\nto volunteer to work on specific tasks.\n\nResolve conflict\n\n    \n\nEvery community has conflict, and yours will be no different. Meetings are a\nuseful place to air issues and resolve personal conflict. We discussed\nconflict resolution in detail in [Chapter 11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling\nConflict and Relationships\").\n\nWithin every community, a primary medium for regular communication should\nexist. Every community member should know they can come together with other\nmembers at an agreed place and at a regular interval to discuss and debate the\nissues that are before the community. This is the function of a regular\nmeeting.\n\nThe first step in getting regular meetings up and running is to choose a\nlocation. There are various options available, such as IRC, conference calls,\nand more. I recommend IRC, though, as these meetings will be open and\nrelatively easy to access, and the conversations can be logged. You should\nensure that wherever you choose to hold your meeting, the meeting is open to\nall and the tools required to join the meeting are freely available.\n\n### Choosing a time\n\nThe next step is choosing a regularity and a time. Regularity is how many\ntimes you want the meeting to occur. This could be weekly, biweekly, monthly,\nor otherwise. Whatever you decide, choose that regularity and stick to it.\nEnsure that your regularity is bound to a day. As an example, your meeting\ncould be “the first Monday of the month.” Regularity is largely dependent on\nyour community and how much discussion needs to occur. I recommend a minimum\nof one meeting a month and to increase the regularity if required.\n\nChoosing a time is a complex task for international online communities. You\nshould look at your primary set of contributors and where they are based, and\nensure that you have your core contributors at meetings. Try to pick times\nthat average out as suitable for the majority of contributors. This may\ninvolve some early mornings or late nights for some people to attend. If you\nhave a truly global spread of contributors, you may also want to alternate\nmeeting times so that the early mornings and late nights don’t bite the same\ncontributors every time. Some contributors will simply never be able to make\nthe meetings due to the times. You should ensure that these people can access\nmeeting notes or a log of the discussion.\n\n### Advertising the meeting\n\nWith these details in place, you should advertise the meeting clearly to your\ncommunity. The most common place to do this is on a website. Make sure you\nhave all the details clearly available. You should also specify the time zone\nof the meeting. A useful tip here is to use the UTC time zone, which is\ninternationally recognized.\n\nHere is an example of how you can make your meeting available:\n\nMyProject Monthly Meeting  \n---  \nThe MyProject Monthly Meeting is an opportunity for our community to come\ntogether to discuss progress, technical issues, problems, and other issues\nrelevant to MyProject. Everyone is welcome to attend.  \nWHEN: First Monday of every month  \nTIME: 20.00 UTC – 21.00 UTC  \nWHERE: #myproject IRC channel on irc.freenode.net  \n  \nWith the meeting text ready, it is time to ensure that your community knows\nthat the meeting exists. You should publicize your meeting in the places where\nyour existing community and prospective community are likely to find it.\n\nThe first and most obvious place is your website. Ensure that your meeting is\nprominently located: it should not be buried behind some obscure menu options.\nYou should have a link to the meeting on the front page of your website, and\nit should be common knowledge where to find the page.\n\nYou should ensure that the URL to the meeting page does not change. This is\nparticularly important if the meeting time and date are changing and if you\nare using the page as a place to put the agenda.\n\nYou also should announce and publicize the meeting in your community’s primary\ncommunication channels. This could include your mailing list, in the topic of\nyour IRC channel, and on blogs. The whole point of the meeting is to get your\ncommunity together, so you should make every effort to ensure that the\ncommunity knows about it.\n\nWhen the meeting is complete, you should also publicize the results. Many of\nyour members will be keen to see what was discussed and what the outcomes\nwere. Publicizing meeting results also indicates to your members that\nimportant things take place there. This will help them decide whether they\nwant to join the next meeting.\n\n### Note\n\nWith guerrilla marketing, not only are you marketing something, but you also\nare encouraging your community to market the same thing in their own way. An\nexample of this is asking your community to do the marketing on their websites\nor in the signature of their emails.\n\nThis is a useful technique for publicizing important community features and\nevents such as meetings. You should encourage your community to share in\ngetting the word out there.\n\n### Setting the agenda\n\nEvery regular meeting should have an agenda set. This can be set by those who\norganize the meeting, but a preferred approach is to allow your community to\nsubmit agenda items. This ensures that everyone is welcome to use the meeting\nas an opportunity to raise issues.\n\nThe method of soliciting agenda items is really up to you, but I recommend\nthat people add their items to an existing agenda so that everyone can see the\nfull agenda. This avoids duplication of agenda topics. A good method of doing\nthis, and one used in the Ubuntu community, is to use a wiki. Put your meeting\ntime and details on the wiki, and use the wiki page as a place for the\ncommunity to add agenda items.\n\n### Running the meeting\n\nIt is essential that your meeting is run well. There are few things more\nfrustrating than a well-organized community meeting with an agenda that fails\nto reach any conclusions, fails to keep to time, and fails to cover all the\ntopics in the agenda. Your goal is to keep the meeting moving along, ensure\nthat everyone gets their chance to speak, and ensure that outcomes are\ngenerated. The most important aim for any meeting is to generate _output_. At\nthe end of your meeting, you want to ensure that there is something to show\nfor it.\n\nNow I want to share some best practices for chairing these kinds of meetings\nthat will help you get the most out of your own meeting time:\n\nExplain the structure\n\n    \n\nKick off the meeting and issue a general welcome. Make it clear at the\nbeginning of the meeting that everyone is welcome to contribute to the\ndiscussion. Next, explain how the meeting works: a series of agenda items will\nbe raised and discussed, and then action items will be generated for each\ntopic.\n\nKeep your eye on the clock\n\n    \n\nAlways keep a keen eye on the clock. If the meeting has a fixed length\n(usually an hour), keep to that time. This will mean determining how much time\neach agenda item has for discussion. This may also mean stopping the\ndiscussion on an agenda item to move onto the next topic.\n\nEnsure speaking equality\n\n    \n\nSome people in your meeting will dominate the discussion, and some will be\nmore reluctant to chip in. To ensure that everyone gets a say, you may need to\nprompt the quieter people and ask if they have any comments. Naturally you\nshould do this only if they are likely to have a comment: don’t just pick on\npeople because they haven’t said much.\n\nFocus on outcomes\n\n    \n\nAlways do your best to keep the discussion focused on finding outcomes and\nactions for moving forward. Every meeting has the potential to turn into a\nlong discussion with no outcome or next steps. Always keep your mind focused\non what needs to happen next to move the topic or goal along to the next\nstage.\n\nThere are pages and pages of content written in books about how to chair\nmeetings well. Doing it effectively is very much a learning process, and it\nwill take time for you to find your feet. I highly recommend sitting in on\nother, longer-established community meetings to learn how those chairs keep\ntheir meetings ticking along.\n\n## Organizing Online Tutorials\n\nWhen I first joined Canonical as the Ubuntu community manager, I set myself a\ncareer-long goal of trying to understand how to bridge the gap between a user\nand contributor. Fundamentally, there is no difference between a user and\ncontributor. Both are big bags of flesh and bones, but some people manage to\nget up and running as a contributor and some don’t.\n\nA key driver in my mind was education. While we had oodles of documentation,\npeople really learn when they sit in the same room, sharing a computer and\npointer, gesturing, and sharing knowledge. Although I could not get our entire\ncommunity in the same room, I was keen to get as close to that educational\nnirvana as possible.\n\nWith this in mind, I developed the concept of the Ubuntu Open Week: a week of\nIRC tutorial sessions that teach attendees how to do something. The week\nincludes sessions for a wide variety of hands-on topics such as how to file a\nbug, how to triage bugs, how to create patches, how to translate the messages\ndisplayed by applications, and more. Each session is delivered by a competent\ncommunity member, and most of the sessions have included upward of 250\nattendees. I am going to use my experiences with the Ubuntu Open Week as a\nbasis to explain how to run your own online tutorial sessions.\n\n### Scheduling\n\nTo create the Ubuntu Open Week, we first decided when it should occur and how\nmany days it should last. Traditionally I have run the event from Monday to\nSaturday so that those who cannot attend midweek can join for at least one\nday. Each day usually has between three and five sessions. With this schedule\nI knew how many session leaders I needed to find. It is up to you and your\ncommunity to determine what kinds of sessions are scheduled.\n\nAnnounce the completed schedule primarily within your internal community\ncommunication channels, such as mailing lists and chat channels, and on your\nwebsite. You may also want to consider doing some external publicity to\nencourage new contributors.\n\n### Preparing for a session\n\nBefore you kick off your tutorial sessions, it is recommended that you ask\nyour session leaders to prepare for the session. Even though each session\nlasts only an hour, that can feel like an awful lot of typing in the thick of\nthings. As such, it is recommended that your session leaders prepare a script\nfor a reasonable chunk of the session, with each item of discussion on a\nseparate line. This script could look a little like this:\n\nhi everyone!  \n---  \nwelcome to my session about how to apply as an Ubuntu developer  \nin this session we are going to discuss the process of how you prepare,\ndocument and apply for approval as an Ubuntu developer  \n. . .  \n  \nGrammar fans may have noticed that the script lacks uppercase letters and\npunctuation. IRC as a medium tends to lack these attributes, and as such,\nlooks more free-flowing and conversational. You want your session leaders to\nsound this way, and so it is recommended that they deliberately keep the\nscript in lowercase letters.\n\n### Running a session\n\nThe way we have typically run the sessions in the Ubuntu Open Week is to have\ntwo IRC channels open at any one time:\n\n#ubuntu-classroom\n\n    \n\nThis is the channel where the session leader delivers the tutorial content. It\nis expected that attendees do not speak in this channel while the session is\nin progress. If you do get excessive chatter, you may need to ask a channel\nadministrator to mute the attendees.\n\n#ubuntu-classroom-chat\n\n    \n\nThis channel is where people can discuss the session while it progresses, and\nask questions.\n\nQuestions are an important part of a tutorial session, but questions could\neasily get lost in the flurry of discussion in the _#ubuntu-classroom-chat_\nchannel. So we defined and published a convention for people to ask questions.\nThe attendee simply prefixes a question with “QUESTION.” As an example:\n\nQUESTION: How do you attach a patch to the sponsorship queue?  \n---  \n  \nThis convention makes it simple for questions to leap out within the mass of\ndiscussion in the channel.\n\n### Note\n\nOne of the excellent attributes that makes IRC so suitable for tutorial\nsessions is that the session can be logged easily. You should ensure that\nevery session is logged and put somewhere on your website for people to\naccess.\n\nSession logs are a great source of content. Many of the questions that are\nfeatured in the sessions could be source material for a FAQ, or the full\ntutorial session log could be expanded into a full HOWTO document. These are\nexcellent tasks that some members in your community might be interested in\nperforming.\n\n### Event-specific notes\n\nLet's take a look at some additional notes for conducting tutorials online:\n\nMedium\n\n    \n\nIRC is the recommended medium for this type of event. IRC allows many people\nto join, is ideal for concurrently running a session and also allowing people\nto discuss it, and allows the session to be logged.\n\nDate/time\n\n    \n\nThere are no additional considerations beyond the general notes that were\ndiscussed earlier.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn this chapter we have explored many of the fundamental attributes involved\nin putting together an event. I not only explained the importance of events in\nthe wider scheme of community, but also explored the different types of events\navailable, discussed the core elements involved, and provided a few examples\nof some events that you could organize.\n\nThe topic of event organization is huge. Countless books, papers, and courses\nhave been created for it. As such, we have only scratched the surface of the\nscience of running great events, and there is still much to learn. What this\nchapter has provided, though, is a firm foundation that will get you up and\nrunning to produce some useful and effective events for your community. Use\nthis chapter as a starting point, run some events, learn from other people,\nlearn from yourself, and continue to refine and perfect your events.\n\nEvery event needs at least two or three tries before it really finds its feet.\nThis has been the case with every event that I have been involved in\norganizing. It takes time to really understand the event, the needs of your\nattendees, the organizational requirements, and the amount of time required to\nget everything ready.\n\nEvents can be the glue that connects your community together with its core\nethos and reinvigorates and reinforces the reason why people are involved. Get\nit right, and you and your community have so much to gain. Good luck!\n\n\n# Chapter 13. Hiring a Community Manager\n\n“I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.”\n\n—Jerome K. Jerome\n\nLike many folks, I have had the good fortune and opportunity to do my fair\nshare of travel to conferences as part of my work. As a result, I have been\nable to experience many of the conferences I once dreamed of attending, but\nthere were still some I never quite had a chance to get to.\n\nOne such show was Ohio Linux Fest, a midsize community-run conference devoted\nto all things Linux and open source. I had always heard great things about the\nshow from a member of my team and members of the community, but for some\nreason the Fates always conspired against me and I was busy every time the\nshow was scheduled: I was either traveling, in meetings, on vacation, or\notherwise unable to get out to Ohio.\n\nBack in early 2008, though, I received an email about the show inviting me to\nspeak. Knowing full well that something was going to get in the way at some\npoint in the future, I slam-dunked the dates into my calendar with a little\nnote next to them:\n\nMAKE IT HAPPEN THIS TIME.  \n---  \n  \nI responded to the email expressing interest, and the organizers kindly\noffered me the keynote speech. Somewhat flattered at the invitation, I happily\naccepted.\n\nAs time meandered on toward the show, I started working on the keynote and\ncreated a presentation that would eventually become the foundation for writing\n_The Art of Community_. It was that talk specifically that inspired much of\nthe thinking behind the first two chapters of this book. I wrote my slides,\ncarefully tweaking each word, and my presentation, rehearsing my endless\nstream of (often awful) jokes and ensuring that everything was as shiny and\nbuffed as it could be.\n\nThe Fates cooperated this time, and when I got to Ohio and to the conference,\nI was instantly deluged with meetings, discussions, and other work that I\nneeded to tend to. While hugely productive and useful, there was also a\nnegative aspect to this barrage of activity: I didn’t get a chance to see and\nmentally prepare for the room I was to deliver my keynote in. I knew the talk\nwas going to pull a decent audience, but I didn’t fully understand the sheer\nsize of the room until I arrived, 20 minutes before my speech. It was\nenormous, and while speaking was by no means new to me, this was a new level.\nIt was the first time I had been nervous about a speech in a long time.\n\nFortunately, the keynote went well and was well received by the audience. As I\npacked up my laptop and chatted with some of the audience members, one guy\nstood there quietly and waited for me to finish my conversations. As everyone\nleft, he walked over and said:\n\n> Nice to meet you, Mr. Bacon, thanks for the speech, but I really fucking\n> need your help.\n\nSomewhat stunned at the presence of an f-bomb in the opening line of a new\nconversation, I let the guy continue to explain that he had been tasked with\nfinding a community manager for his company (a small independent software\nvendor), but was struggling. He had flown here from Canada desperate for help.\nAlthough the seriousness and extent of this poor guy’s panic was rare, the\nconfusion surrounding community management and how it fits into an\norganization is not.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common for an organization that either has a\ncommunity or is seeking to build one to hire someone to lead this work.\nUnfortunately, in many cases they have no idea of what specifics they want or\nwho to look for. Many look to existing community managers for advice and\nguidance.\n\nThis book has focused on teaching a prospective community manager and\ncommunity leader how to build and inspire a strong and productive community.\nHowever, this book has not explored how to bring such a role into an\norganization and help get that person up and running easily. This in itself\npresents its own set of challenges and opportunities, and these are the focus\nof this chapter.\n\nAlthough this chapter may initially seem to be the stuff of managers tasked\nwith hiring staff, it can also be of real value to (a) existing community\nmanagers who want to build a team and (b) community managers who are looking\nto understand the needs and expectations of their communities.\n\n# Why Community Building Has Become a Big Business\n\nCommunity has become quite the buzzword in many business circles, particularly\nin IT. Its presence is felt more and more at conferences, in papers, on blogs,\nand across the current global sensation that is Twitter. Regardless of the\nmedium, this explosion of interest in community has happened for three closely\ninterlinked reasons.\n\n_Community_ is implicitly a positive word. It speaks of openness,\nparticipation, awareness, and an agreeable intention to engage in an\nenvironment driven by merit as well as caring for others. For open source\ncompanies, this is powerful inferred meaning that speaks well to their\naudience. As such, it makes entire sense for a company to light up its website\nlike a Christmas tree with references to “community.”\n\nSecond, for those interested in open source, community has become synonymous\nwith “engagement in the open source space.” Open source companies are fully\naware that if they don’t have an answer for their community relations\nstrategy, they simply won’t be taken seriously by a significant demographic of\npeople. Whereas five years ago this demographic of people was often seen as\nstrange, hygienically challenged, bespectacled nerds who lived in their\nmothers’ basements, it is now well known that those with buying capacity\nand/or influence are placing importance in the community attributes of open\nsource. These are _real_ customers who have developed this value expectation\ndue to the constantly reinforced open source mantra of participation,\ncommunity, and technical quality. When the industry cradles open source and\nits associated values, the big cats in the ecosystem need to adjust to reflect\nthat.\n\nFinally, irksome economic times have resulted in very real consequences for\nsmall businesses. Executives have been forced to reassess how they can achieve\ntheir goals and ambitions with a more painful awareness of the bottom line.\nMultiple marketing and engineering people can be expensive—a lot more\nexpensive than a community manager.\n\nThe accumulation of reasons for building community in a business environment\nhas created a strong commercial justification for community and for those who\ncan build it, along with a set of expectations around what these community\nbuilders can deliver.\n\nAvoiding the Hype\n\nA problem befalls (a) those who seek to understand the scope of community and\n(b) those who communicate their expectations and experiences of building\ncommunity.\n\nIn every industry, certain words that once had reasonably obvious illustrative\nattributes and consequences have subsequently become colloquial references. We\nhave seen this extensively with trademarks: aspirin, the hoover, cellophane,\nthermos, and even heroin were all once trademarked to specific companies\n(Bayer, Hoover Company, DuPont, Thermos GmbH, and Friedrich Bayer & Co.,\nrespectively). Using hoover as an example, in England many people will refer\nto any brand of vacuum cleaner as a “hoover.” At one point in time, though,\n“hoover” pointed to a very specific representation of focus, quality, and\nexpectation in a vacuum cleaner, embodied in products from the Hoover Company.\nSince then, the trademark has been somewhat genericized in different parts of\nthe world, and what some refer to as a “hoover” will often bear little\nresemblance to the virtues of Hoover Company vacuum cleaners.\n\nCommunity managers face similar risks built on misguided expectations. With\nall of the buzz, focus, and excitement around community management flowing,\nsome more public representatives of the role have been a little guilty of\nstepping over, hiding, and downplaying the very real day-to-day focus of this\nwork in favor of academically pleasing social science. When the high-level\nrepresentation of community managers overplays the very real “on the ground”\nfocus of the role, the balance becomes unset and there is a risk of\ngenericizing community management as “the theory of working with groups of\nsimilar interests” as opposed to connecting the term firmly with hands-on best\npractice in building real communities that do real, measurable work.\n\nAs you are looking to fill your community manager role, be aware of this hype\nand how it affects candidates. To avoid it, look for substance in the day-to-\nday interactions, achievements, and efforts in the candidate’s work. If there\nis an overwhelming level of theory and social science in response to direct\nquestions about this day-to-day work, alarm bells should trigger.\n\n# The Role of a Community Manager in the Corporation\n\nIn recent years the Internet has been ablaze with chatter over where community\nmanagement should fit into an organization. Is _marketing_ or _engineering_ an\napt destination for the reporting line? Do we expect our community managers\nand representatives to report to the director of marketing or the chief\ntechnical officer? More specifically, when you bring a community manager into\nyour organization, which of these two teams do you feel can most effectively\nsupport and enable a community builder to actually build a great community?\n\nI firmly believe that community management is a tale with both marketing and\nengineering story lines flowing through it. If one is missing, community can\nfeel unbalanced, misrepresented, and ineffective. We should always seek to\ncelebrate and market the opportunities and importance of community, but that\nmeans nothing if you are not willing to roll up your sleeves and build and\nreinforce the collaborative technical groundwork in your community.\n\nUltimately, your community manager should be well versed in the mechanics and\ntechnical/social foundations of collaboration in open source communities and\nshould be able to strategically structure and execute objectives that enable\nyour community on the ground to do great work. You should ensure that your\ncommunity manager has a close connection to your technical leaders, but also a\nclose connection with your marketing department to help them articulate and\nexpress your community story.\n\norm-interview-snippet: The Community Case Book\n\n> You must be open about your philosophies, your practices, and your plans.\n> You must tell the community what they can get for free and what they will\n> need to pay for.

Unlike positions with a longer history\nin companies, where roles and expectations are clear, community management\nembodies a lot of ambiguity and can confound hiring managers.\n\n## Scope of the Role\n\nBusy hiring managers who already have many other roles to fill often fail to\nrecognize the importance of understanding a community, so their job\ndescription contains unreasonable expectations around the role. A mismatched\njob description means that when a candidate is found, he resultantly has\nsomething of a bumpy road in getting a grip on the role. If you are lucky and\nget a hardy candidate who is willing to take the knocks while the role is\nbeing fleshed out, you may come out all right in the end, but the adjustment\nis stressful for most candidates and wasteful for the company.\n\nTo understand the scope of the role, you need to first understand (a) what the\nscope of the community is and (b) what your expectations are for someone to\nwork with that community to enable and extend it. Let’s break these two\nseparate points into a series of questions that you should answer before you\ncraft the job description, beginning with the scope of the community itself:\n\n  * Who is in your community?\n\n  * How big is it?\n\n  * What kinds of skills and diversity are present in your community?\n\n  * How does the community interact and work with your company?\n\n  * What kind of governance infrastructure is in place?\n\n  * Who are the contentious people, and what are the contentious topics?\n\nTo determine the expectations around managing that community, we can approach\nthe previous set of questions but assess where we see them trending in the\nfuture:\n\n  * How do you want to better understand who your community is?\n\n  * How would you like to grow the skills and diversity in your community? What are the primary skills and roles that you would like to focus on?\n\n  * How would you like to change, improve, and otherwise focus on how your community works with the company?\n\n  * What new and improved governance is required, and where should you focus your efforts first?\n\n  * How would you like to resolve and improve relations with the contentious people and topics in the community?\n\nWhen you have answers to all of these questions, you should have a set of\nbroad, high-level goals and ambitions that you would like to see your\ncommunity manager focus on. You should now run these goals and ambitions past\nsome other members of your organization to ensure that they are doable for a\ncommunity manager candidate. As you receive feedback, you can refine this set\nof goals and expectations.\n\nWhen you have hired your manager, you can use this set of goals and\nexpectations to build a full strategy for the manager. We will discuss this a\nlittle later in this chapter.\n\n## Risk\n\nOne element you should be entirely clear about is the risk associated with\nbringing a community manager on board. Fundamentally, what you are doing is\nhiring someone who will become a public face and representative of not only\nthe community, but also the company. If you get the right person with a strong\ncommitment to both, you have the potential for a long and productive\nrelationship. If you get the wrong person, your difficulties may be\nembarrassingly exposed to the world.\n\nThe primary risk here is that when someone represents your community, she acts\nas a delicate middleperson between the organization and the community. This\nperson plays a careful role in balancing expectations and making it clear that\nshe will represent the best interests of each to the other.\n\nWith this responsibility lies the risk of the community manager getting\nfrustrated with both the organization and the community. If the agitation is\nsourced from the organization, the manager may decide to leave and potentially\ndefame the organization to the community as revenge. On the other hand, if the\nsource of the frustration is from the community, the manager may get burned\nout and generate problems internally that ultimately reflect back on both the\ncommunity and the organization. We discussed the topic of burnout earlier in\n[Chapter 11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and Relationships\").\n\nIn summary, you need to be extremely careful about whom you hire into your\ncommunity management role. You and your community manager are going to need to\nbe able to understand these risks and be able to handle them in a professional\nand upstanding way. You need to find someone whom you implicitly trust and who\nis not going to put a personal agenda before the community.\n\n## Breaking Tradition\n\nAnother expectation to adopt is that community managers may well need to step\noutside the traditional boundaries of the business world. For a community\nmanager to really build a rapport with the community, he needs to\nfundamentally be a member of that community and exhibit the culture of that\ncommunity. That in itself can ruffle some feathers in the organization.\n\nMuch of this is based around seemingly unimportant elements that actually play\na key role in community management. As an example, most volunteer communities\nare very casual places. People wear casual clothes, and you should expect your\ncommunity manager to do this as well. You should expect your community manager\nto be vocal, loud, and opinionated. It is this over-the-top personality that\nwill pump up the community and get them excited. You should expect stimulating\nand vivacious presentations at conferences, laptops covered in stickers,\namusing and conversational interviews, and other elements. While I am not\nsuggesting that you should demand these attributes from your community\nmanager, don’t be surprised if you get them.\n\nIn my own experience, I have brought a huge amount of my personality to my\nwork. My communities know of my wacky sense of humor, my love of heavy metal,\nmy loud and gag-laden presentations, and my up-front and frank discussions\nwith community members. I am proud of this approach to my work, and other\ncommunities are likely to be the same. You should ensure that your hires are\nfree enough to exercise individuality in this role.\n\nDespite this, of course, there is a line. When you have the opportunity for\nvivacious and excitable representation in the role, there is an increased\npossibility of your community manager putting a foot down wrong, offending\nsomeone, stepping out of line, or otherwise embarrassing herself, the\ncommunity, and the company.\n\nExpect it. Every community manager steps over the line at some point, and you\nshould expect it to happen within her first year on the job. When it does\nhappen, use it as an opportunity to sit down with her and have a discussion\nabout where the line is drawn and how to avoid problems in the future. A frank\nand open discussion will not only make it clear that the behavior was\nunacceptable, but also will ensure that your relationship with the community\nmanager is built on a foundation of openness and frank discussion.\n\n## Control and Reporting\n\nThe final clear expectation you should have in your mind is where your\ncommunity manager sits in the company. Earlier we talked about whether the\nrole fulfills more of a marketing or engineering approach, and you should\nconsider this carefully.\n\nTo make this decision, look back at the questions we discussed when talking\nabout the scope of the role earlier in this chapter, and determine whether\nyour community manager is going to be focusing more on your message about the\ncommunity or the collaborative infrastructure, processes, and growth of the\ncommunity. In other words, are you expecting your community manager to help\ntalk about the community and company at conferences and to customers and\njournalists, or to actually help grow, build, refine, and optimize the nuts\nand bolts in the contributor community?\n\nIt is likely that the answer to this question will be “both,” but consider\nwhich is the prevalent focus. As an example, if your community manager is\nprimarily looking after a contributor community that produces an open source\nproduct, I heavily recommend that she reports to an engineering manager. If,\nhowever, you primarily expect the community manager to fly around the world to\ntalk about and represent the community at conferences and tradeshows and to\nspeak to the press, I recommend two things. First, have her report to your\nmarketing department, and second, change her title from community manager to\nsomething else: she is representing the community, not managing it, and many\npeople will expect the latter and be disappointed.\n\n### The ability to enact change\n\nHot on the heels of which part of the organization the community manager\nreports to is how much control and opportunity this person has to enact\nchange. This is a complex but unfortunately common problem with many who have\nhired community managers: they succeed in bringing information about the\ncommunity into the company, but lack the power and contacts to implement any\nof the change they recommend.\n\nAs an example, imagine your community manager recommends a series of\nimprovements to an element of your community’s technical workflow. These\nimprovements may require technical changes or refinements in other parts of\nthe organization, such as a specific engineering resource. If the community\nmanager rolls up to that person’s cubicle and plonks down a big list of\nrequired changes, it is unlikely those changes will be implemented anytime\nsoon. That engineer has her own big ol’ list of work to focus on, and any\nadditions, such as these proposed refinements, are likely to be gently shaken\ndown to the bottom of the TODO list.\n\nTo mitigate this blockage, you should ensure that your community manager has a\ndegree of control over changes and refinements to parts of the organization\nupon which the community’s work depends. While I am not expecting you to have\nengineering teams report to a community manager, make sure engineering\nmanagers make community changes and requirements a priority when gathering\nrequirements in a new strategic plan or cycle.\n\nAnother excellent approach that has worked for me is to form a small ad hoc\nteam with approval from the managers. This small team works together to solve\nproblems that involve multiple teams in the organization. As an example, if\nyou have an engineering problem that involves a source control system and a\nwebsite, have one person who represents the source control system, one who\nrepresents the website, and your community manager. Form an agreement to work\ntogether on combined problems and get approval from the manager to regularly\ndiscuss the prioritization of these problems.\n\n## The Responsibilities of Community Engagement\n\nAnother important attribute to consider is how your organization expects to\ninteract with the community after a community manager comes on board. In many,\nmany organizations, once they proudly hire someone into an explicit community\nmanagement role, other people in the organization assume that the community\nmanager will carry out interaction with the community on behalf of the teams.\nAs an example, if a software company has a department that builds a particular\nproduct, it may be assumed that any and all community growth and interaction\nwith regard to that product will be performed by the community manager.\n\nYou need to determine whether your community manager will indeed perform this\nfunction in the organization or whether he will instead act as more of a\nconsultant to help other people in the company work directly with the\ncommunity. Whatever the decision, it needs to be clearly communicated across\nthe organization and the community.\n\nMy recommendation is that your community manager should perform direct\ninteraction with the community for some teams but act as a consultant for most\ncommunity-facing teams. This way you will have a high quality of interaction\nin key places where it matters most, and can build a culture of community\ninteraction in your organization. This approach is also far more scalable:\nhaving a single person act as the community representative will always end up\nblocking on that person.\n\n## Salary\n\nSalary is a hugely complicated topic when it comes to hiring a community\nmanager. The reason is fairly simple: the role is so new and unknown for many\norganizations that it is difficult to gather fair expectations around salaries\nand a market rate.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the common resources HR departments tend to use to\ngather data provide mismatched and unrepresentative information to work from.\nAs an example, you can do a search for “community manager” and find an average\nsalary in many recruitment and job database websites, but in almost every case\nthe search returns entirely unusable data.\n\nThe reason for this is that the term _community manager_ points to all manner\nof different types of responsibilities in all manner of different types of\norganizations. I know “community managers” who work for tiny nonprofit\ncharities and organizations and who look after a community of less than 30\npeople. I know of others who look after communities of hundreds of thousands\nof people with complex collaborative frameworks, technical workflow, and\nsignificant public focus and responsibility. These are not the same types of\nrole and should not demand the same salary.\n\nAnother consideration is the “manager” part of “community manager.” Many\ncommunity managers don’t actually manage anyone: the “manager” in their title\npoints to their influence over the community. As an example, in my current\nrole I manage a team of community managers who work on many different aspects\nof a community. So while part of my role firmly involves influencing a large\nand thriving community, I also have the formalized, traditional management\nresponsibilities of a team inside an organization. This kind of management\nrole should be reflected in the salary decision.\n\nUnfortunately, I can offer limited advice on a suitable salary for your\ncommunity management role. The decision requires a firm awareness of the\nmarket (the supply and demand) and deriving a figure at that point. I have\npreviously advised companies about salaries, so feel free to contact me if you\nare unsure. Otherwise, take the pulse of your community as well as the wider\nmarketplace, come to your own figure, and run it past a few other hiring\nmanagers who have hired community managers. This should help you find a\ncompelling and fair figure for both your company and potential candidates.\n\n## Communicating Expectations to the Candidate\n\nAfter resolving in your own organization the expectations we have covered over\nthe past few pages, you should make them clear to potential candidates. Some\nof them should be expressed up front in the hiring process and as part of the\ninterviews: the primary expectations around the role, what they will be\nworking on, and what they will mainly spend their days doing. These\nexpectations are the meat and potatoes of what will constitute the role.\n\nThere are some other, subtler expectations that may be involved in the role,\nthough, and you should make these clear also. Many are rife with potential for\ncausing trouble if they are not made clear from the get-go. So take a look at\nthe following list of expectations and see whether they apply to the community\nmanagement role you are looking to fill. If so, make them clear to candidates\nin the interview process.\n\nAdjustments to the role\n\n    \n\nThe role of community manager in your organization will likely adjust, grow,\nand change on two levels. First, the expectations around how your community is\nmanaged will change as you learn more about the community, as your\norganization changes its focus, and as your company grows or shrinks. Second,\nthe specific areas of focus and strategy that are covered in each strategic\ndocument will undoubtedly change. Your community manager needs to be flexible\nin both of these areas.\n\nUnusual hours\n\n    \n\nMany communities span multiple countries, connected by the Internet. With this\nin mind, your community manager may have to keep some unusual hours. This is\ncommon when scheduling online meetings and events: to ensure that a chunk of\nthe world can attend the meeting, it can often mean your community manager\ngetting out of bed in the middle of the night to attend. You should ensure\nthat she is willing to do this.\n\nTravel\n\n    \n\nMany community roles involve extensive travel to conferences, sprints, and\nother events. Although many jump at this opportunity, others have families and\npartners to consider. Also remember that circumstances change: people get\nmarried, give birth, and want to get off the road. You should expect that\nwhile your candidate is happy to travel right now, that’s likely to change in\nthe future.\n\nPublic attention\n\n    \n\nMany community managers become public representatives of the community and the\ncompany, and you should make it clear if this is an expectation. If it is, the\ncandidate should expect to have to answer tough questions sometimes in\ninterviews, on panels, and elsewhere. If this is the case, you should make\nclear to him that he will be expected to fulfill this role, but you should\nalso support him extensively in handling these issues.\n\nConflict resolution\n\n    \n\nMany community management roles involve dealing with conflict and contentious\nsituations. Some people are uncomfortable with these expectations, and you\nshould clarify them up front. More details on the specifics of conflict can be\nfound in [Chapter 11](ch11.html \"Chapter 11. Handling Conflict and\nRelationships\").\n\nTechnical knowledge\n\n    \n\nSome communities are very technical places. These communities often require a\ncommunity manager with extensive technical experience in the workflow,\ninfrastructure, and processes of a technical collaborative community. You\nshould make these requirements clear to your candidate and set an expectation\nthat these technical requirements are likely to increase as your community\nevolves, changes, and grows. The candidate will be expected to learn these new\nconcepts and skills.\n\nPresentation skills\n\n    \n\nMany community managers get out on the conference circuit and perform\npresentations about their work. You should check whether they are happy to do\nthis. You should also research whether they are actually any good at\npresenting: sometimes no presentation is better than a horribly delivered\npresentation. As such, you may want to pass the presentation helmet to someone\nelse.\n\nYou should get these issues on the table in the first interview. The\nexpectations should be clear and up-front to avoid any uncertainty in the\nfuture, and you should preferably document them for future reference. Where\nyou document them is up to you and your department: some may feel the contract\nis the most suitable place, whereas others may consider an addendum document\nfor employment that sets clear but noncontractual requirements.\n\n# Managing Your Community Manager\n\nWhen you have recruited someone to fill the community management role in your\norganization, the next step is to ensure that you get that person settled into\nthe role easily and effectively. While there are plenty of books available for\nhiring people and having them settle in, I want to share some hints and tips\nwith specific regard to community managers.\n\nWhen I have hired people to join my team and manage a community, I have broken\ndown the process into three primary areas:\n\nInduction\n\n    \n\nThe first month is critical when someone joins your organization and, more\nspecifically, your team. These are the topics involved in this very early part\nof the community manager’s new employment in the organization.\n\nStrategy\n\n    \n\nThis is how you define and build a set of agreed-upon objectives so that you\nand your community manager are entirely clear on where to focus her efforts.\n\nManagement and communications\n\n    \n\nThese are the weekly operational elements involved in managing your community\nmanager.\n\nLet’s now take each area for a spin and explore some of the attributes\ninvolved. Let me state again that I am focusing only on elements that\nspecifically apply to community managers. You should augment these words with\nthe general best practices used when new employees enter your organization.\n\n### Note\n\nAs we work through each area, I will present the information from the\nperspective of the manager of a community manager. As such, much of this\ninformation will be of primary use either to readers who need to hire and\nmanage a community manager or to community managers who are hiring a team. As\nI mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, though, if you are a current or\nprospective community manager, this content can help illustrate some of the\nexpectations that your manager will have of you.\n\n## Induction\n\nWhen your community manager first joins your organization, you will have to\ncover the usual set of induction-related items: setting up email addresses,\naccessing company resources, creating calendars, and other such activities.\nAlthough these are important, they are not of interest to us here. More\nimportant is the way your community manager exploits the induction period to\ndefine his reputation in the organization and the community.\n\n### Internal reputation\n\nReputation is critical for all community management. From the perspective of\nthe company, a community manager is seen as an important entity who has\nknowledge, focus, and awareness of not only how the community members think\nbut also how they work. Remember: many people simply don’t understand how\ncommunity works, and the community manager acts as a translation layer to help\nother parts of the organization understand how this seemingly random entity\nfunctions.\n\nWith this in mind, you should carefully consider how your community manager\nbuilds his reputation in the organization. This is important for a few\nreasons. Your community manager is going to need to know how to work with and\ninteract with different parts of the organization, and vice versa. He will be\nfaced with many different challenges and queries within the community, and\nmany of these topics will need to be forwarded and integrated into other parts\nof the organization.\n\nAnother important reason to build these bridges is to help your organization\nunderstand what a community manager does. With the role still very new and\nunknown in the minds of many, some people will either not know what the\npurpose of the role is or misconstrue or simply hold a cynical idea of it\n(“Oh, community management—that’s just hanging out with nerds and writing blog\nentries” is one verdict I once heard!).\n\nIt is important to clarify to everyone what the role involves and build a\nsolid reputation for your community manager. It helps to schedule a set of\nintroduction meetings or calls with other departments in your organization and\nmake sure to involve your community manager in wider discussion and topics\nwhere appropriate.\n\n### Community reputation\n\nYour community manager’s reputation is critical with the community she is\nhired to work with. One of the very first tasks she should focus her efforts\non is building a strong reputation with the community.\n\nIt is possible that this reputation already exists if you hired her out of an\nexisting community. If not, you should ensure that she has the time and\nencouragement to get out there and get to know the community. This can involve\na range of approaches:\n\nParticipation in communication channels\n\n    \n\nThe community manager should participate in communication channels such as\nmailing lists, forums, and other resources. This should not just involve\nreading, but responding and participating in discussion, too.\n\nBlogging\n\n    \n\nIf the community is one that is likely to read blogs and online articles, your\ncommunity manager should be actively writing about her work. This is an\nexcellent platform on which to build a medium for writing about her efforts,\nwhere she is working, and what achievements the community has made.\n\nTravel\n\n    \n\nIf your community needs to secure a reputation with the wider community in\nwhich your specific community fits, you may want to send your community\nmanager off to some key events and encourage her to make some presentations.\nTravel is also an excellent opportunity to network and get to know important\nmembers of the community well.\n\nTo help your community manager build her reputation, I recommend you ask her\nto read other parts of the book, most specifically [Chapter 7](ch07.html\n\"Chapter 7. Building Buzz\").\n\nBe Wary of Too Much Travel\n\nI have an important tip when it comes to travel, based on a mistake made with\nmany new community managers.\n\nThe recipe is often the same when a new community manager starts. He joins,\nthere is a little bit of press and hype, and then the organization sends him\naround to every conceivable conference in the interest of building his\nreputation.\n\nAlthough this is excellent for building relations with the community and\nbeyond, it is very costly, both in terms of time and money. Aside from the\nobvious monetary costs and the effect on personal life, conference travel is\ngoing to seriously disrupt your community manager’s ability keep up with\nemail, have calls, and hold meetings. Regular and consistent participation in\nthese more mundane activities is critical to getting the basic work of the\ncommunity done.\n\nSo don’t make your community manager travel too much. His primary value is on\nthe ground working with your community: don’t compromise that in the interest\nof presenting at conferences.\n\n## Strategy\n\nFrom the very start of your community manager’s term of service with your\norganization, you should have a strong focus and strategic priorities. A\nstrategic document that outlines your community manager’s responsibilities,\nsplit into objectives, goals, and success criteria as we did in [Chapter\n2](ch02.html \"Chapter 2. Planning Your Community\"), will communicate what your\ncommunity manager should be working on and formalize your expectations.\n\nA strategic plan is valuable to guide all your employees, of course, but it’s\nparticularly important for your community managers because there is simply so\nmuch scope in their work. A community is a huge, boiling pot of activity that\ncan produce a potentially epic collection of information on which a community\nmanager can focus. It is important, therefore, for you and your community\nmanager to understand, prioritize, and focus on a selected set of objectives\nand goals.\n\nWhen your community manager comes on board, show her the strategic plan you\ndeveloped from [Chapter 2](ch02.html \"Chapter 2. Planning Your Community\"),\nagree on a set of objectives, break them down into goals, and flesh out the\nstrategic document into tasks for the community manager. The strategic plan\nwill also help you track progress on that work as it proceeds.\n\n## Management and Communications\n\nAs with any other staff member, you will need to manage and check in regularly\nwith your community manager. Although many of the common approaches for\nmanaging staff can be easily applied to a community manager as well, I’ll note\nhere a few specific considerations.\n\nThese considerations are primarily related to how your community manager works\nwith other teams inside your organization and how he brings those teams\ncommunity input. We can highlight two primary areas of focus:\n\nWeekly engagements\n\n    \n\nEach week, your community manager should work with different parts of your\norganization to determine what goals to work on and to quickly identify\nanything that stands in the way of those goals.\n\nCommunity feedback\n\n    \n\nYour community manager is an excellent funnel through which the community can\nchannel feedback and opinion to the organization. You want to ensure that this\nis factored into your community manager’s workflow.\n\nLet’s now take a look at both of these topics in more detail.\n\n### Weekly engagements\n\nAs soon as your community manager joins your organization, you should set up\nregular calls or meetings in which you cover the following:\n\nAreas of focus\n\n    \n\nDiscuss the current topic and areas where the community manager should focus\nher attention. Ask her where she feels she should be focusing her efforts,\nthen help and advise her on how to achieve these goals.\n\nStrategic review\n\n    \n\nI recommend that in each meeting you review your strategic document and the\ncommunity manager’s own goals that you drew from it, to track progress. This\nis an excellent opportunity to highlight any blocks or problems with progress\nand to ensure that you are in the loop.\n\nOpportunities\n\n    \n\nAlways explicitly discuss new opportunities and areas where you may want to\nconsider focusing your efforts, either now or in the next strategic time\nframe.\n\nProblems and concerns\n\n    \n\nYou should always ask your community manager what issues, problems, concerns,\nand blocking factors are causing difficulties for his work. In many cases,\nrelatively simple issues will be blocking work and initiatives, and you might\nbe able to help solve this.\n\nCommunity problems and concerns\n\n    \n\nYou should also check in to see whether there are any problems with\ninitiatives and work in the community itself. Are members of the community\nblocking this work? Are there concerns and problems in the community for which\nyou can offer help to your community manager?\n\nIn addition to your personal meetings, determine what other parts of the\norganization should communicate with the community manager on a weekly basis.\nYou may want to organize a team call that bridges several parts of your\norganization. By making your community manager a member of a wider team, you\ncan ensure the flow of information between your product engineering teams and\nthe community manager.\n\nFinally, you should advise your community manager on who else she should check\nin with on a weekly basis. This may include marketing, senior management,\nother specific parts of the organization, or people who are working on\nspecific projects that involve the community.\n\n### Community feedback\n\nWhen your community manager joins you, do your best to ensure that she is able\nto get feedback from the community to key members of your organization.\nCommunity managers are always seen as primary contact points in communities,\nand you should expect them to receive input, opinion, concerns, worries, and\nother useful feedback from the community. You want to ensure that this\nfeedback gets delivered to the right ears.\n\nThe easiest method of doing this is to make sure your community manager knows\nwhere feedback should go. When a new community manager joins an organization\n(particularly a large one with a complex hierarchy), this can be a complicated\ntopic. It could be useful to directly provide her with a list of contacts to\nget in touch with when different topics of feedback come up. In addition to\nthis, you should always ensure that she feels comfortable asking you to whom\nshe should forward feedback if she is unsure.\n\n# Summary\n\nThroughout this chapter we have explored many of the topics involved in hiring\na community manager. We have covered how to set reasonable expectations, how\nto merge that role into your organization, and how to build a measurable\nstrategy to keep you and your community manager on the same page. Even if you\nfaithfully carry out these steps, you should still expect a certain amount of\nthe unknown.\n\nCommunity management is still a very new profession. As community management\nbecomes a more common role in organizations, and as I hopefully put out\nfurther editions of _The Art of Community_ , I look forward to solidifying\nthis chapter with more and more advice. Fortunately, the information I have\nprovided here should get you off to a great start. If you temper this chapter\nwith your own experience and what your community manager tells you, you will\nget everyone off on the right foot.\n\n\n# Chapter 14. Community Case Book\n\n“Learning never exhausts the mind.”\n\n—Leonardo da Vinci\n\nWhen I started writing the first edition of _The Art of Community_ , my\nprimary goal was to distill and present one man’s thesis and approach to\ncommunity management and leadership. The logic was simple: I have a pretty\nfirm grasp of my own experiences, opinions, and approaches, and I could\nconfidently articulate them.\n\nAs I continued writing the book, I found myself wanting to include some of the\nknowledge I was fortunate enough to glean from others. I included this\ncontent, cited it where relevant, and provided props to those who helped me to\ndefine and grow my career. While this knowledge was useful in augmenting the\ncontent of the book, I didn’t have the space to tell the stories or feature\nthose insights in greater detail.\n\nWhen I started writing this second edition of the book I really wanted to\ninclude this additional content. There are so many inspirational and\nfascinating community stories going on right now in the world, and this\nchapter pulls together many of them.\n\nIncluded here is a collection of interviews with various friends who have been\ndoing great community work over the years. These stories are diverse and cover\ntechnology, music, business, and other areas, and I encourage you to read them\nall, even though it takes a bit of a time commitment. They tell the stories\nand perspectives of many community leaders who are at the forefront of change\nand innovation within their respective worlds.\n\n# Linus Torvalds, Linux\n\nLinus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux kernel and arguably the forefather\nof the Linux movement. He has been the chief architect of the kernel for many\nyears and today acts as the project’s primary coordinator. In the year 2000,\nLinus was voted 17th in the _TIME 100_ , TIME magazine's list of the top 100\nmost important people of the century; in 2004, TIME named him as one of the\nmost influential people in the world, and in 2006, the magazine named him as\none of the revolutionary heroes of the past 60 years.\n\nHere we discuss how Linux started, and how Linus grew his community, defined a\nclear set of values, and structured his community to be successful, all\nwrapped inside his trademark honesty and frankness.\n\n_When Linux started, how did you get people interested in participating?_\n\n> Very early on, I wasn’t even interested in people really participating; I\n> wanted comments and suggestions for features people needed. It was my\n> project, for my own use, and what I was interested in was not really so much\n> help, as keeping my project alive by having others give ideas and keep me\n> motivated.\n>\n> When people started sending patches, I initially often ended up rewriting\n> them to suit me better.\n>\n> So I really didn’t plan any of it, or work at trying to get people to\n> participate. But once they started to engage in the project, I was very open\n> to the issues they had, partly because I really had no plan of my own, so\n> people sending me patches never interfered with some “bigger plan” of mine.\n> Even when I rewrote the patches, the project was clearly pretty open.\n\n_What do you consider the important values in the Linux kernel community and\nin how people participate?_\n\n> Different people have different ideas about what’s important, and that’s OK.\n> To me, a project is only as useful as its users find it, so to me what’s\n> important is code quality, and that we don’t break users’ environments. At\n> the same time, I do it because it’s fun and interesting, and that’s the\n> “value” I appreciate.\n>\n> To others, it’s the whole “freedom” thing, and yet to others it’s about\n> making a living. And it’s all OK, and I don’t think the “important values”\n> are what matters, but that open source allows people to work together\n> despite having all these totally different ideas of what they want to do and\n> even _why_ they want to do it.\n\n_The Linux community has a very flat organizational structure and does not\nhave countless governance bodies as seen in other large projects. Why do you\nfeel Linux has not been tempted down this route?_\n\n> I really don’t know. Personally, I don’t like committees, and I absolutely\n> abhor the groups with “commit privileges.” But clearly they have worked for\n> other projects, so maybe my personal dislike of them may be a bit odd. I\n> don’t like the politics that seem to often happen in those kinds of\n> environments, and I believe that they also tend to make forks very\n> acrimonious, because they tend to turn a technical disagreement into a\n> social problem.\n>\n> The Linux model was always pretty distributed, even back before we used\n> distributed tools. That may sound odd, because in some ways the original\n> model of me doing tarballs and patches was _really_ centralized, and I was\n> the only one with “commit privileges.” But while that was true at one level,\n> at another level it was true that a lot of other people simply had their own\n> trees, and distributions all had theirs, and there was never any kind of\n> “cabal” that controlled things. We all controlled our own trees, and the\n> fact that I never paid anybody or acted in that kind of position meant that\n> I couldn’t force people to do what I wanted, and while I was in some respect\n> a central figure, I didn’t really have any power to tell people how they had\n> to work.\n>\n> And I still eschew trying to have some kind of “technical board” that\n> decides what direction development should take. Or rather, I think it’s\n> healthy that there are _many_ of those technical boards, all with their own\n> agenda, and none of them “owns” the kernel. And I am still central, but I’m\n> still central with no real power over anybody, just the trust of people that\n> I don’t do totally crazy things.\n>\n> And it seems to be working. In the kernel community, we’ve had lots of\n> forks, but they tend to be technical in nature. Not all of them work, and\n> I’m not claiming that people are _happy_ when their fork doesn’t necessarily\n> end up being used, and there is obviously always jockeying for position,\n> etc., but on the whole I think it’s still a pretty “healthy competition”\n> rather than the kinds of ugly forks that some projects have had.\n>\n> Knock wood.\n\n_You have seen Linux grow from a small project to a global contributor base.\nWhat were the main challenges in dealing with this growth?_\n\n> Oh, we’ve had several times when we’ve had some really bad growing pains.\n> It’s seldom so much about the code not working as the flow of development\n> not working, and something (often _somebody_) holding things up. And yes,\n> that somebody has sometimes been me, and we’ve had to figure out how to\n> change how we do things so that no single person ends up being that kind of\n> bottleneck.\n>\n> We seem to have succeeded pretty well, but it’s not always been pretty. We\n> change our code _all_ the time, and each release tends to have a million\n> lines of changes or so. But changing how you actually _do_ something, that\n> can be painful, and people will fight that tooth and nail. It’s how we’re\n> wired up: we all get comfy with our way of doing something, and doing things\n> another way is just irritating and inefficient.\n>\n> So we’ve had issues over tools and code flow—back with the original tarballs\n> and patches, then bitkeeper, and then it took _years_ for people to really\n> grow comfy with git.\n\n_How did you handle some of these challenges with this growth?_\n\n> Very little of it was planned. Sure, we have had transitions that were\n> actually explicitly planned and designed, but they tended to have been about\n> the details—the big stuff was all pretty organic. We started doing\n> something, it worked for a while, then it didn’t scale anymore, we got into\n> big and ugly fights, and we ended up trying some other approach. Very much a\n> “trial and error” kind of model, where the approaches that work were kept,\n> and the ones that cause friction and problems eventually get whittled away\n> and changed.\n>\n> And I really want to stress the “not a lot of planning” part. All our big\n> changes came not because we foresaw some better way of doing things, but\n> because our old ways of doing things got _so_ painful that people started\n> really disliking each other because things weren’t working smoothly.\n\n_The kernel has garnered significant commercial interest. How have you\nbalanced the interest of these companies with the values your community holds\nimportant?_\n\n> I actually think the commercial interests have been very important to make\n> sure that they balance the purely geek interests.\n>\n> In other words, I think a lot of technical projects tend to easily bog down\n> in technical issues, and only have technical users, and never become very\n> good. And I think a lot of the reasons why Linux got successful was because\n> we ended up also getting all these commercial interests (fairly small in the\n> beginning, but it was a small project, so…) that actually counteracted some\n> of the “by geeks, for geeks, nontechnical people need not apply” mentality\n> that can otherwise often happen.\n>\n> So the whole “technical versus business interests” thing I think has worked\n> really, really well, and both bring a lot to the table. A company that lets\n> _pure_ business interests say what should be done will result in a bad\n> product, but it’s equally true that having pure technical issues at heart is\n> also a bad approach.\n>\n> And no, it’s not that we actively tried to somehow “counteract” the business\n> interests. Sure, we’re technical people, and we distrust business people\n> with their two-drink minimums at a rather visceral level, but I think having\n> both has been very, very important.\n\n_What are the main lessons you have learned over the years about working with\nthe community and what advice would you offer budding community leaders?_\n\n> Don’t try to “work the community.” You can’t. It’s not about a project\n> leader trying to take advantage of all those people lining up to help,\n> because that’s not what will happen. Instead, do the best you can, and help\n> them do what they want. Then you may be able to occasionally guide them in\n> particular directions when they trust you.\n\n# Mike Shinoda, Linkin Park\n\nMike Shinoda is the principal songwriter, rapper, keyboardist, vocalist, and\nrhythm guitarist of the rock band Linkin Park. Mike has been exploring many\nfacets of community, technology, and collaboration in his work. He has been\nactively involved in growing a global Linkin Park community, coordinating\ncommunity resources and media, ensuring that the band has a close connection\nwith fans, and more.\n\nMike has also spoken extensively about social media and the role of large\nrecord companies in the modern music industry. Outside of Linkin Park, Mike\nalso formed Fort Minor as a side project, is an active artist and painter, and\nhas produced a number of albums.\n\n_How did Linkin Park grow a community of fans around the band back when you\nstarted out?_\n\n> We started the band out of our apartments in Los Angeles. We were in college\n> at the time, around 1998, and the Internet hadn’t really caught on yet, as\n> strange as that is to say. When we really started promoting our music, we\n> were handing out cassette tapes. At our shows, we always hung out by the\n> merchandise booth, to meet new fans. We would hand them our mailing list,\n> which had options for snail mail and email; more than half the people didn’t\n> fill in an email address, because most people weren’t really using it yet.\n> It was a different time.\n>\n> When we chose the name Linkin Park, we originally wanted to spell it\n> “Lincoln Park”...but we also had the foresight to know the importance of\n> getting a memorable domain. So we chose to spell it “Linkin” because\n> _www.linkinpark.com_ was available.\n>\n> After that, we got on the road and we made sure to always super-serve the\n> fans that chose to sign the mailing list. We sent them free tapes and\n> stickers. When they ran out, we sent them more. And we packaged and shipped\n> everything ourselves, right out of our drummer’s apartment.\n\n_As the band has achieved wide success, how has the relationship with your\ncommunity grown and changed?_\n\n> Today, with a fan base as big and spread out as ours, the toughest part is\n> keeping everyone informed and keeping our messages organized. We always have\n> a TON of stuff going on. Aside from the obvious things like albums, singles,\n> and tours, we have a Linkin Park documentary-style channel on YouTube, an\n> online radio station, a charity called Music For Relief, side projects, art\n> shows, clothing and merchandise...I feel like the list can go on forever.\n> Notably, we also have a fan club called the LP Underground that has a\n> nonstop universe of action going on all the time: Linkin Park “Summit”\n> convention events (think LP Comic-Con), surprise chats with band members,\n> exclusive music, and an episodic LPUTV channel which is updated a few times\n> a month.\n>\n> The key, for us, is to know what lanes to put all that information in. You\n> can’t blast all that info to the whole fan base (via Facebook or Twitter,\n> for example) because most people will feel like they’re getting spammed. And\n> on the other end, there are people who can’t get enough, no matter how much\n> we’ve got going on.\n\n_With this success, how have you as musicians handled the sheer scale and\ngrowth of your community? Have you tried to maintain a personal connection\nwith your fans despite the growth?_\n\n> Today, an honest face-to-face is the most valuable thing. Back in 1999, on\n> our first tour, we did meet-and-greets with fans before every show. We\n> thanked them for coming, we signed stuff, and we took pictures. As the band\n> grew, we constantly reminded ourselves to never let that go. On our tour\n> last month, we signed for up to 100 people every night.\n>\n> It also should be said that we know the value of a surprise. Especially one\n> that lets the fans know we’re listening. I’ll often reply directly to\n> comments on _mikeshinoda.com_ , and I love to get into Q+As and debates with\n> the fans online. We ask for suggestions on a lot of our online programs and\n> our websites. I also randomly drop into the fan chat rooms unannounced. I’ll\n> chat for a few minutes with the 20 or so people that are in there, to give\n> them special time; then I’ll tweet that I’m in the chat and hundreds of\n> other people will show up. That way, the ones who were there first get\n> special time, and I still spend time with the larger group. I think it’s\n> important to do it on “my time.” I don’t really schedule these activities,\n> because then I’ll feel like it’s “work.” I only go in when I feel like I\n> want to.\n\n_Linkin Park and Fort Minor have evolved in the digital and social networking\nage. How have you used these technologies to interact with and grow your\ncommunity?_\n\n> We were unbelievably lucky to have _Hybrid Theory_ come out just as Napster\n> and the MP3 really took off. We got to ride that last wave of big album\n> sales with a hit—not many albums will ever receive a Diamond Award again. I\n> think it taught us to be grateful for each moment, because everything can\n> change so quickly. And it also taught us to watch technology, because music\n> and tech go hand-in-hand.\n>\n> Specifically, I think our philosophy has become one of championing new sites\n> and technologies we believe in, and making ourselves available wherever the\n> people are. We poll our fan base to find out what they’re up to. We collect\n> whatever data we are allowed to. We create separate online access points—and\n> embrace all the different ways people choose to keep in touch with our\n> band—so they can connect to us via whatever thing they like to use. Facebook\n> gets the bigger updates, Twitter gets its own things, LPU gets lots of\n> exclusive ones, and so on. Right now, we know a large percentage of our fans\n> love video games, so we make a lot of efforts in that space.\n\n_Traditionally, music fans have just been shared consumers. Do you see\nopportunities for artists where fans can collaborate around content to support\nand grow awareness of the artist?_\n\n> When we announced our fourth studio album, _A Thousand Suns_ , we opened up\n> a contest where fans could remix our new single, “The Catalyst”...but the\n> catch was they hadn’t heard the single yet. It hadn’t been released. We gave\n> them random tracks of the song—a drum loop here, a guitar there, a couple\n> vocals that didn’t quite line up—and let them guess at what it would sound\n> like. And we announced that whoever we picked as the winner was going to get\n> to write with the band, and their material was going to end up on the album,\n> officially, everywhere in the world.\n>\n> This idea was a huge risk for us. Fans could decide that the song was\n> “supposed” to sound a certain way, or like a fan version more than ours! And\n> what if the person who won ended up being terrible, and we were forced to\n> put some of their awful material on our album? In the end, we decided to\n> bite the bullet and go through with the experiment for the sake of doing\n> something groundbreaking—and a little dangerous.\n>\n> There were thousands of submissions. I think we heard all of them. A third\n> of the entries actually submitted tracks where the parts didn’t start on the\n> same beat as our song; they were a quarter note early or late (on beat, but\n> shifted), which sometimes sounded bad, but occasionally sounded cool.\n>\n> Finally, we found an amazing submission by a guy from Poland named\n> _NoBrain_. We instantly knew he was a good fit. The ways he was effecting\n> the sounds in the remix felt as if he had already heard the album. His\n> winning remix was featured on the B side of the single for “The Catalyst,”\n> and he wrote with us on a song called “When They Come For Me.” Since he\n> lived in Poland, and our timeline was tight, we wrote and recorded with him\n> online, using Skype and an online recording community called Indaba.com. It\n> was a home run.\n\n_We live today in a remix and YouTube culture. How do you see this culture\nfrom the perspective of an established artist and content producer,\nparticularly in an increasingly paranoid record industry?_\n\n> I like fan participation and community. That’s all good. The main place I’d\n> like to see a change, in general, is that moment when a fan decides to buy a\n> song or album. For some reason, they still think they need to go to an\n> online store like iTunes or Amazon. For Linkin Park, we offer the fans a lot\n> of incentive to buy directly from us. We have exclusive packages that\n> include limited and unique other stuff that you can’t get anywhere else,\n> like signed skate decks, limited edition tees, posters, and art books.\n>\n> Even if someone just wants to buy the album and nothing extra, we give them\n> more, for the same price! We might give them videos, extra songs, access to\n> discounts on other merchandise, or concert ticket presales. I don’t know why\n> fans haven’t realized they get a ton more value when they buy direct from\n> us, but someday they will.\n\n_You have said in the past that you see no reason why an artist needs to sign\nto a big label. Do you feel there is an opportunity for a community of fans to\nprovide the same support that a label would produce, and if so, how so?_\n\n> An unestablished artist has very few reasons to go to a major label. I\n> always tell upstart musicians to go it alone, try to learn everything they\n> can, try to be as self-sufficient as is reasonable, and focus on building a\n> fan base artist-to-fan. You’ll get a better understanding of what you’re\n> doing, and you’ll have the chance to build a substantial base organically.\n> If you get some traction, you know you’ve got something that works. And look\n> at it this way—who would the labels want to sign: a new artist who only has\n> 100 fans online but a slick demo with a name-brand producer or manager, or a\n> new artist who can sell 10,000 copies and a proven and organic connection\n> with their fans? The latter situation will have labels beating down your\n> door with better offers, and it will be up to you to decide whether or not\n> to turn them down.\n>\n> I suppose the only time that isn’t true is when the artist simply wants to\n> be a pop star, and is happy letting the label turn them into a profitable\n> commodity in order to be famous. But in that case, I wouldn’t call them an\n> “artist,” and they may not even be a “musician.” I’m not very familiar with\n> that mindset. To me, the real excitement comes from a true artist-fan\n> connection. A movement. A culture. That’s where the magic is.\n>\n> If you work hard to improve your craft, and care deeply about the integrity\n> of your art, I think you have a good shot. I believe if you make something\n> good, success will follow. “Success” doesn’t just mean money, by the way.\n> Doing what you love to do—and being able to live a comfortable lifestyle\n> while doing it—is a great gig.\n\n# Mårten Mickos, MySQL and Eucalyptus\n\nMårten Mickos was the CEO of MySQL AB, was senior vice president of the\ndatabase group at Sun Microsystems, is a member of the board of Mozilla\nMessaging and RightScale, and Entrepreneur In Residence at Benchmark Capital.\nCurrently he is CEO of Eucalyptus Systems, the company behind the Eucalyptus\nopen source cloud infrastructure.\n\nMårten has been at the forefront of the open source business world and has\nbeen faced with the responsibility of balancing the corporate interests of an\norganization with the participatory interests of a community. This provides\nhim with unique insight into how others in a similar position can face this\nequilibrium, too.\n\n_Where do you see the opportunity for companies to harness community?_\n\n> Any company that has a broad customer or user base can harness community. I\n> am not saying it is easy, but it can be done. Today, the concept of\n> “community” stretches far beyond open source software.\n>\n> Some examples: Local Motors engages with the community to design cars,\n> BurdaStyle to design sowing patterns. _Star Wreck_ is the most popular\n> Finnish movie ever made. It was produced by a community of enthusiasts and\n> distributed through free downloads all over the world. The TED conference\n> has built up an amazing community of speakers and influencers who produce\n> and share amazing talks.\n>\n> The notion of a community and of an architecture of participation is so\n> strong that it can apply even to closed source software. Microsoft may not\n> understand the value of FOSS, but they have built an impressive developer\n> community around Visual Studio.\n\n_You have been at the forefront of how companies and community fit together.\nWhat do you feel are the ground rules for ensuring that a company and\ncommunity work well together?_\n\n> Transparency and integrity. You must be open about your philosophies, your\n> practices, and your plans. You must tell the community what they can get for\n> free and what they will need to pay for. By integrity I mean that whatever\n> business model you choose, it must be based on respect for the individual:\n> respect for users and respect for customers.\n>\n> People will accept many different models as long as they know they can trust\n> you and that you have told them all the important aspects of your thinking.\n>\n> Branding can be a sensitive topic. At MySQL, we had the same brand for the\n> community stuff and the commercial stuff. Everything was just “MySQL.”\n> Around Red Hat it is different. You have Linux the project, Fedora the\n> community distro, and Red Hat the paid-for enterprise product. Canonical\n> uses “Ubuntu” both for nonpaid community software and paid-for offerings.\n> Again, as with business models, many different approaches are OK, but you\n> must be clear to your ecosystem how you will deal with naming and branding.\n> Open source people can be quite particular with how they want software and\n> related offerings to be named.\n\n_How do you balance the needs of company stakeholders and community\nstakeholders?_\n\n> The key to this balancing act (and, I’d say, to any balancing act) is to be\n> very clear on how the model works and what the goals are. As an open source\n> software vendor, there is a reason you have a community. There is a reason\n> you have paying customers. There is a reason you have investors (if you do).\n> You need to go through the sometimes cumbersome thinking process of why\n> exactly you are dealing with some group.\n>\n> For instance, if you want a community so that you get help in finding and\n> fixing bugs, you need to make it very easy for anyone to adopt your\n> software, even at the expense of short-term revenue goals. Otherwise, you\n> won’t have a community. If you want a community so that you have a champion\n> in every organization, you may take some other actions. If you want a\n> community that may turn into paying customers (not that I personally believe\n> much in that model), you will take some other actions. Your actions in this\n> balancing act are a direct function of what your real goal is.\n>\n> My point is that when properly analyzed, the “balancing act” isn’t really a\n> balancing act other than over a timescale. You have some goals you must\n> achieve right now and other goals you will achieve later. The goals are not\n> in conflict with each other—they just have different maturity times.\n\n_How do you ensure that the community’s needs are not overlooked as a company\ngrows and scales upward?_\n\n> You need to be clear about your strategy, and you need to stick to it. There\n> could, for some companies, be a temptation to go for short-term benefits in\n> the hope that “the community won’t notice.” That won’t really work. You must\n> have a well-articulated strategy and stick to it.\n>\n> Even as I say that, it still isn’t easy. As an example, MySQL got criticism\n> in 2007 and 2008 for changes we did to our business model. If you study\n> those events closely, I think you will see that throughout this time, we\n> improved what was available free of charge to our user community. The\n> community got more than before.\n>\n> But we also added more commercial features and offerings. Some saw this as a\n> deviation from our stated business model. They felt that we had an\n> obligation to not produce anything that was only for paying customers. The\n> way we saw it, that was an extra—something we produced on top of whatever we\n> would have been doing anyhow for the community. What we did for the free and\n> open source software communities was bigger, stronger, and more valuable\n> than before. So we felt we had provided the community with a net positive.\n> We felt we were entitled to additionally build something for paying\n> customers only.\n>\n> Many agreed with us, but not all. For some, it boiled down to a difference\n> in view of what an open source business model is allowed to be. We were\n> convinced we took care of the needs of the community better than before. But\n> the fact that we _also_ produced commercial stuff became a contentious topic\n> with some. I don’t think there really is a generic solution to this dilemma.\n> As an open source business leader, you just must be ready for situations\n> where you cannot please all.\n\n_What do you look for in the perfect community manager?_\n\n> This is a difficult question to answer, because “community manager” is such\n> an elusive job title. You could say that everyone in the company needs to be\n> community-focused, so there isn’t a need for a specific community manager.\n>\n> But if you do hire one, which I recommend, what should she or he do? In my\n> view, the main role of a community manager is to ensure that the company’s\n> operations are open, community-friendly, and inviting of participation. The\n> main role is about helping manage the company’s day-to-day operations.\n>\n> The community manager does NOT have to be a blogger and [tweeter] and social\n> person in general. It doesn’t hurt if she/he is, but this is not the main\n> point. The person also doesn’t have to attend every meet-up and FOSS event.\n> The main point is turning the company inside out—making it an outward-\n> focused organization that willingly, and I think I would say charmingly,\n> engages with the world around it.\n>\n> When that basic function of enabling public participation is in place, then\n> the community manager can think of how to lead and guide the community\n> members, how to invite them to take small or large responsibilities in the\n> community, and how to communicate with the broad community.\n\n# Mike Linksvayer, Creative Commons\n\n[Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) has been a revolutionary\nforce in enabling artists and content creators to share their work easily and\neffectively. The organization has created a set of licenses that make it\nsimple to protect the content creator’s rights while building a culture of\nsharing, remixing, and creating derivative works. I am a huge fan of Creative\nCommons and this book is licensed under a Creative Commons license.\n\nMike Linksvayer serves as vice president of Creative Commons. Mike originally\njoined Creative Commons as its chief technical officer in 2003 and then became\nvice president in 2007. Previously he cofounded Bitzi, an early open\ncontent/open data service.\n\n_You have been at Creative Commons for a long time now. How did the\norganization look when you joined?_\n\n> I joined Creative Commons in April 2003, a few months after the first\n> Creative Commons licenses were released. We were in the basement of the\n> Stanford Law School, as that’s where Lawrence Lessig was. Various people had\n> been involved over the preceding year, but essentially there were three\n> staff [members] just before I joined. There was a very loose community\n> initially, based on the notoriety of Lessig and other founders and some\n> friendly coverage in the usual (for the time) geek outlets such as\n> Slashdot—more a variety of well-wishers than a community.\n\n_What kind of community did you set out to grow?_\n\n> The other person Creative Commons hired in April 2003 was our first\n> international coordinator, based in Berlin. One community that we set out to\n> grow, initially via this position, was a network of legal scholars around\n> the world, who could collectively figure out how Creative Commons licenses\n> work with copyright law in various jurisdictions around the world. This is\n> the main community that Creative Commons was and is intentional about\n> growing. We also set out to grow connections with related communities—for\n> example, open access, open education, open source—and mostly deliberately\n> stayed away from trying to create Creative Commons subcommunities within\n> these movements, and instead play a supporting role.\n>\n> There always has been a mostly latent “Creative Commons community” of people\n> who aren’t tied to a Creative Commons affiliate institution, and may or may\n> not be involved with other nearby movements, but for whatever reason see\n> Creative Commons as one of their primary passions—which is fantastic, of\n> course. Creative Commons the organization hasn’t ever really set out to\n> “organize” this largely latent community, mostly due to lack of bandwidth\n> (admittedly this could seem shortsighted), and it isn’t clear how this\n> community ought to be cultivated—it is a very diverse set of people. I and\n> some others see mobilizing this community (I’m actually more comfortable\n> thinking about it as a movement) in some form as one of the biggest\n> opportunities Creative Commons has in its next decade.\n\n_What approaches did you use to grow your community?_\n\n> Regarding the international community of legal scholars we intentionally\n> created, we gave them interesting, challenging, but highly delimited\n> work—“porting” the Creative Commons license suite to their respective\n> jurisdictions. (A “port” is usually both a linguistic translation and legal\n> “translation” to reference local laws, drafting style, etc., where\n> appropriate to hopefully make the ported licenses more understandable to the\n> legal community in a given jurisdiction, but achieve the same effects to the\n> extent possible.) This element of concrete work made it relatively easy to\n> determine what kind of team (usually composed of people from one or more\n> local institutions) could be part of the formal community—they had to bring\n> certain legal expertise, interest, and capacity—and gave community members a\n> strong sense of ownership and contribution.\n\n_How much growth have you seen in this work?_\n\n> In the past eight years Creative Commons licenses have been ported to over\n> 50 jurisdictions via this process and community. In a sense this is just\n> another instance of work occurring in chunks amenable to work being done by\n> lots of different people, but I think the subject matter and large size and\n> duration of the chunks makes it fairly interesting. Although many of the\n> affiliate projects have formed their own local communities that have given\n> feedback on license drafts, the overall process is highly controlled by\n> experts, and openness to attracting and up-leveling drive-by contributors\n> [is] not much of a factor. This arrangement has been shown to not be\n> competitive for building an encyclopedia, nor for most software and cultural\n> projects, but perhaps should be evaluated if one thinks their project\n> requires long-term commitment from a community with narrow and rare\n> expertise.\n>\n> Among the community involved in license porting, there has always been a\n> desire to also do advocacy and outreach, and sometimes art projects and\n> software development. This has occurred organically, but over the last year\n> or so we’ve also formally recognized those activities as potential\n> responsibilities of a Creative Commons affiliate. While producing\n> interesting work, a community that only really needs a few lawyers in each\n> country is self-limiting. The aforementioned activities need unlimited\n> resources, including the involvement of many more lawyers, who are crucial\n> in persuading institutions and governments to adopt Creative Commons tools\n> as policy, for example. Probably over the next few years there will be many\n> more institutions and people officially involved in the Creative Commons\n> community, with impressive outreach and projects around the world as a\n> result.\n\n_The Creative Commons philosophy, particularly a few years ago, was fairly\nalien to the normal culture of content licensing and distribution practiced by\nlarge record labels and studios. How did you communicate this message to your\ncommunity?_\n\n> Building a commons is still completely alien to “big content”; not even\n> relevant, really. Giving up the ability to legally persecute fans and users\n> is a bridge too far for those whose dominant interest is protecting and\n> milking existing revenue streams for however many quarters their horizon is.\n> If it takes destroying the Internet to do that, so be it. This has to\n> change, but the change won’t come from big content adopting Creative Commons\n> licenses wholesale (though of course we appreciate when a progressive\n> element does so for a project, and I’d be happy to be wrong), but through\n> policy change that removes their ability to persecute fans. Have we reached\n> “peak copyright” yet?\n>\n> Communicating this to the Creative Commons community is not a challenge—they\n> already knew how poorly aligned the interest and practice of big content and\n> society are, and for many people this was a motivating factor for getting\n> involved in Creative Commons.\n\n_So where do you see the primary challenge today?_\n\n> The challenge has been figuring out where the commons can make a big\n> difference, given the indifference to hostility of big content. The answer\n> has [been] arrived at fairly organically, learning both from the broader\n> community (e.g., FLOSS, Wikipedians, the Open Access movement) and from the\n> Creative Commons affiliate community’s work on institutional and government\n> policy. The summary is that Creative Commons’ sweet spots are community and\n> mass collaboration projects, where legal freedoms are necessary for a\n> project to scale, just like in FLOSS, and in publicly interested policy,\n> where the policymaker might be a funder, an institution, or a government. In\n> both of these cases, the appropriate Creative Commons license or public\n> domain tool is a standard, well-understood and recognized instrument that\n> can be made the legal basis of a project, or slotted into a broader policy\n> intended to benefit the public, instead of engaging in expensive debate and\n> reinvention—and there’s a big community of experts eager to help, wherever\n> one is in the world.\n\n_There is this passionate Creative Commons community out there, but how did\nyou build a community that takes the Creative Commons ethos, and spreads it\nfarther and advocates it to others?_\n\n> Sharing, giving credit where due, valuing the common good, using technology\n> to encourage such, not persecuting people who do those very natural\n> things—things that one might recognize as “the Creative Commons ethos”—all\n> precede Creative Commons. They’re essentially human. Creative Commons\n> created some practical tools that one can use to further those ends and a\n> brand that denotes such an ethos at our particular juncture in history.\n> People would’ve been spreading that ethos in the same contexts Creative\n> Commons is now—one can see an explosion of experiments in open content\n> licensing in the years just before Creative Commons launched. Hopefully,\n> overall, Creative Commons has made those people more effective than they\n> would’ve been without a fairly high-profile and well-resourced (but tiny in\n> the scheme of things) license steward, that is, Creative Commons.\n>\n> We did make an attempt in approximately 2005–2008 to provide a nexus for\n> open movements to meet and collaborate, a subsidiary called iCommons (now a\n> small independent charity) that ran a series of “iSummits.” These turned out\n> to be mostly useful for bringing the Creative Commons community together, so\n> our next global gathering, which did not occur until September 2011, made no\n> pretense of being anything other than a Creative Commons summit. There\n> remains a huge opportunity to, at appropriate times, work together with\n> other communities and movements with an overlapping ethos—more of that is\n> happening, but slowly, and not under an umbrella brand.\n\n_Creative Commons is now a well-established organization and community. How do\nyou keep your community passionate about Creative Commons and Free Culture?_\n\n> Regarding the Creative Commons affiliate community (copyright and other\n> experts mentioned earlier), carefully and collaboratively. Some of the core\n> work by that community is changing: we’re working on version 4.0 of the\n> Creative Commons license suite now, which has the aim of being unambiguously\n> global—porting as it has been done so far may end, or at least will be a\n> special case. We have to build the diversity of the work of this community,\n> and it has to be even more vital and challenging work; for example, Creative\n> Commons adoption as policy, leveraging Creative Commons’ reputation in\n> nearby policy debates impactful to the commons, Creative Commons as a\n> subject of legal, economic, and other research, and interfacing with WIPO\n> and other international institutions. We have to strive to make Creative\n> Commons a truly international organization itself. What this means for\n> governance, staffing, fundraising, the structure of relationships with\n> affiliates and other organizations—we don’t know yet, and [it] will probably\n> always be evolving.\n>\n> Regarding the broader community and potential movement, the flip answer is\n> that we don’t have to do anything. The passion is there, and Free Culture,\n> Creative Commons, open education, etc., provide endless good news and\n> opportunity for all interested—and occasionally we get a gift in the form of\n> a ridiculously incorrect attack on Creative Commons from a big content\n> executive—that fires everyone up. However, there’s a lot that we do, the\n> single most important one being serving as a great license steward, which\n> includes everything from explaining and answering questions to advocacy to\n> actually getting the licenses “right” so that they’re the best tools for\n> growing the commons. If our explanations of the licenses are confusing, or\n> we have licenses that don’t serve to build the commons, it puts a real\n> damper on the ability of the community to advocate and spread Creative\n> Commons, and their passion for doing so.\n>\n> The 4.0 process is also going to be crucial for engaging the broader\n> community, and be a determinant of how much passion and energy we see from\n> them over the next decade. My highest aspiration would be for the 4.0\n> licenses to have received overwhelming input and buy-in from both the\n> broadest set of “netizens” (if I may use a 1990s term) interested in the\n> common good and policymakers, forming a standard for information and\n> innovation policy and norms for a generation. Coming anywhere near that goal\n> will require lots of community organizing!\n\n_Creative Commons is funded by donations. What approaches have you used to\ngather these donations?_\n\n> So far the vast majority of our funding has come from US-based private\n> foundations. Our main effort for community support (which I consider the\n> [healthiest] form of funding, and should over time become the most important\n> pillar) has consisted of an annual fall campaign, mostly conducted\n> online—think a micro version of the Wikimedia fundraising campaigns that\n> many readers might have seen. Creative Commons has a lot of learning and\n> growth to do here. The main reason to cultivate the Creative Commons\n> community is that doing [so] will be instrumental for accomplishing our\n> mission; but it is true that we hope that a portion of the community has the\n> means and feels our work is important enough to donate each year.\n\n# Tim O’Reilly, O’Reilly Media\n\nTim O’Reilly is the founder of O’Reilly Media, a diverse company with a goal\nto spread the knowledge of innovators. O’Reilly started doing this via the\npublication of books (_The Art of Community_ is published by O’Reilly), many\nof which are the best-known books in the technology field. O’Reilly has since\ndiversified into conferences (e.g., OSCON, Strata, TOC, Velocity, and Where),\norganizing the popular FooCamp gathering of leading minds in the industry, and\nhas an investment division called O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures (OATV).\n\nTim has also been seen as a thought leader on change and innovation in\ntechnology. He was a driver in the adoption of Web 2.0 and has been a\nproponent of social media, and particularly Twitter.\n\n_What is your social media story? How did you get started, and what attracted\nyou?_\n\n> My “social media story” begins long before Facebook or Twitter. When I\n> organized my first conference, the Perl Conference, in 1997, it was because\n> I recognized that there was a community online that would benefit from\n> connecting in person. To this day, my best ever social media experience was\n> the rush of being in the same place as people, who in many cases, had worked\n> together online for years, but had never met in person, didn’t even know\n> what each other looked like, had never heard the sound of each other’s\n> voices. It’s important to remember how primitive the Internet was, and how\n> much of what we take for granted today didn’t exist yet. There was wonderful\n> community, but it was a community of code and comments, of IRC and mailing\n> lists.\n>\n> When I organized the Freeware Summit (later known as the Open Source Summit)\n> in 1998, it was because I recognized that there were multiple communities\n> like that, that their leaders had never met in person, and would benefit\n> from talking about common problems and shaping a common story. And being a\n> media company, we organized a press conference at the end of the day to get\n> that story out. And sure enough, two months later, Linus Torvalds was on the\n> cover of _Forbes_ , with full-page pictures inside of Larry Wall, Richard\n> Stallman, Brian Behlendorf, and others.\n>\n> Social media is about community, about the stories that tie those\n> communities together, and about tools to amplify the connections between\n> them. I was doing that long before I got on Twitter or Facebook.\n\n_Which social media networks really captured your interest first?_\n\n> It was Twitter that first pulled me in. I had signed up for Twitter and\n> Facebook to try them out, but didn’t stick around. But one day I checked\n> back into Twitter, and by gum, I had 5,000 followers! I was embarrassed that\n> I hadn’t been giving them anything to follow, so I started to tweet\n> actively. And because I’m an ideas guy, what I shared was links to what I\n> was reading far more than what I was doing. That’s a style of tweeting that\n> _@jayrosen_nyu_ christened “mindcasting.” At the time, it was somewhat\n> atypical, but it’s since become one of the most common forms of tweeting.\n\n_How has your usage of Twitter changed and evolved over time?_\n\n> Now that I have over 1.5 million followers, that’s a kind of publishing\n> platform. I follow about 800 people and try to pass on a lot of tweets from\n> them via retweet, as a way of amplifying not just the ideas but other people\n> who are good sources of them. I measure my tweeting success not just by how\n> many people click on my links but also by how many followers I can add to\n> someone who “gives good tweet.” I was proud when someone created a graph of\n> what they called “the @timoreilly bump” showing the spike in their\n> followers. And of course, that’s what I do as a book publisher and\n> conference producer, too: find good stuff and try to amplify it.\n>\n> But I also have a second private account that I use for what _@leisa_ called\n> “ambient intimacy.” That’s where I follow 20 or 30 people I really care\n> about, and with whom I share personal details of my life. That’s the\n> original Twitter use case, and I find it really lovely.\n>\n> But I religiously read and reply to my @ messages on my main Twitter\n> account, because it allows anyone to reach me and vastly increases\n> serendipity. And some of the folks I follow have figured out to DM me when\n> they want to bring my attention to something they’ve posted, in hopes I’ll\n> retweet it.\n>\n> Increasingly, I’m using Twitter and Google+ as a kind of one-two punch. For\n> short links, Twitter is ideal. But if I want to share more of an opinion and\n> engage with those who comment on my links, I post to G+, and then use\n> Twitter to point to that post rather than to the original story.\n\n_Many new technologies have surfaced over the years, but why do you think\nsocial media in particular has been so successful?_\n\n> The two greatest social media success stories to date, Facebook and Twitter,\n> succeeded for very different reasons, in my opinion. Facebook found a\n> natural market where people are trying to get to know other new people in a\n> compressed time frame, and built an app that “just worked” for that target\n> audience. Once it thoroughly dominated that niche, it spread from there.\n>\n> Twitter’s secret sauce was its minimal nature. And asymmetric following was\n> its really great viral hook.\n>\n> But in the end, social is everywhere. Wikipedia is social, for instance. In\n> his wonderful new book, _Reinventing Discovery_ , Michael Nielsen says\n> something like “Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia. It is an online city whose\n> principal export to the net is an online encyclopedia.” And of course, this\n> is true of open source development communities as well.\n\n_Social media has been known to be incredibly disruptive. What are the most\nmemorable and inspiring social success stories that you have seen?_\n\n> The Arab Spring is obviously the canonical example, but #ows (Occupy Wall\n> Street) is happening right now as an example of the interplay between social\n> media and real-world disruption.\n\n_How do you feel that social media has opened up opportunities for communities\nto prosper?_\n\n> I’m not convinced that the current generation of social media sites have\n> helped communities to prosper in the way that earlier technologies like\n> mailing lists or even Usenet did. They create a social graph centered on the\n> individual rather than the community. The development of tools to support\n> communities is still an untapped opportunity.\n\n_Today social media seems to largely involve the exchange of messages. How do\nyou think social media can evolve to further empower collaborative community\nbeyond that of exchanging messages?_\n\n> If you consider Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ to be the apogee of social\n> media, yes, it is mainly about the exchange of messages. But what’s really\n> more interesting is collective work, or the production of collective value.\n> And as I tried to make clear in my original advocacy about Web 2.0,\n> “collective intelligence”—which is another face of social media—has been a\n> driver of every major advance on the Web.\n>\n> This idea of collaborative value creation is obviously central to something\n> like Wikipedia, but it’s also at work in Google. It is our collective\n> activity of creating and linking to web pages that Google mines to create\n> its search engine.\n>\n> And of course, it’s central to software development tools like Github.\n>\n> I’m also fascinated by tools like Kickstarter, which allow for collaboration\n> in funding of projects, and even Storify, which allows someone to build a\n> more lasting product out of a stream of tweets.\n\n_With an increasingly social world, how do we balance visibility and privacy?_\n\n> We balance visibility and privacy in the same way we’ve always done, with\n> social norms. We don’t keep people from peering into our homes at night by\n> living in windowless buildings. We have lightweight privacy mechanisms like\n> curtains, and we stigmatize (and penalize) people who peek through them.\n>\n> Because of the breadcrumb trails we leave about ourselves online, and the\n> power of data mining to assemble those trails into full loaves of bread,\n> we’ve got to give up on the idea that privacy is based on secrecy. It’s\n> based on a society that knows when to avert its eyes.\n\n# Carolyn Mellor, X.commerce, PayPal, and eBay\n\nCarolyn Mellor (_@carolynmellor_) is senior manager of the X.commerce\ndeveloper community. She is responsible for working with the X.commerce\ncommunity team to create and build community programs that will support and\nadvocate the needs of developers and merchants working with X.commerce.\n\nCarolyn has been in technology for 20 years and has held multiple technical\nmanagement positions within eBay and PayPal; in addition to building a\nsuccessful multilevel technical support organization she led a technical\nproduct team responsible for merchant and partner experience. Prior to PayPal,\nCarolyn spent five years managing internal and external technical support\ngroups at UPS, and nine years leading an IT department and developing websites\nfor a large automotive dealer group.\n\n_What are the goals at PayPal and eBay for working with the community?_\n\n> We have several goals for working with the community. Of course, we want to\n> have new developers join our community—interact with us and use our\n> services. Our goals are around community registrations, activity on and off\n> our website, participation in our events, and using our products. Our\n> ultimate vision is to create a robust ecosystem around commerce that\n> provides the support and opportunities for developers to turn their creative\n> ideas into reality and generate revenue.\n\n_How have you structured the developer community, and how do you work with\nthem?_\n\n> Currently we are structured by business unit—we interact with the community\n> based on which of our services they use. As we evolve, I think that we may\n> change the structure as well as the interaction.\n\n_How do you manage this as a team?_\n\n> Currently we have community managers for each one of our business units\n> (e.g., eBay, PayPal, X.commerce, Magento); this allows the community\n> managers to gain some level of product and service expertise so that they\n> can engage with and support the community. We have our online communities\n> structured this way as well as our programs; this allows for easy\n> interaction between developers using the same services.\n\n_How did you structure your technology to ensure the community can use it\neasily and effectively?_\n\n> Because of our organic growth and the fact that we have merged multiple\n> communities together, we have structured our website by business unit so\n> that developers interested in the products and services of that business can\n> find everything they need. In the last few years, we have added more\n> features and utilized them throughout all of our communities. We have chosen\n> technology that can be updated quickly, has an engaged community, and is\n> scalable for our needs.\n\n_You have a team working on these goals. How did you grow the team and what do\nthey do?_\n\n> I have grown my team in order to serve our different developer communities.\n> Currently we have one community champion per service/business unit. The\n> community management organization presently develops a global community\n> engagement strategy and owns the objectives, priorities, schedules, and key\n> results. We lead the effort to design and launch new community features in\n> partnership with product management, engineering, and other cross-functional\n> stakeholders.\n\n_How do you do this work?_\n\n> We coordinate content creation through writing or facilitating blog posts,\n> articles, newsletters, communication materials, and material for social\n> media channels. In addition, we share community feedback with our internal\n> product teams, so their feedback is incorporated into current and future\n> road maps. We drive building, planning, and executing engagement programs to\n> grow community acquisition and interaction. We do this by creating,\n> managing, and growing the organization’s presence through blogs, Twitter,\n> Facebook, YouTube, and other strategically relevant online properties.\n>\n> Our community champions are also responsible for customer support—answering\n> questions however they come in (phone, email, Twitter) and\n> managing/organizing moderation of any online feedback or Q&A forums. We\n> utilize user measurement tools to provide reports on metrics, and\n> continually seek ways in which to improve on those metrics through new\n> initiatives.\n\n_How do you break down these different types of work?_\n\n> Our overall community team consists of several teams: the evangelist group\n> that educates developers on our products, the tools and docs team that\n> generates tools for developers to interact with our services, the events and\n> outreach team, which coordinates developer events, and our X.com\n> ProductD/Product team that builds and supports our website.\n\n_What resources and facilities have you put in place to help the community\ncollaborate together?_\n\n> We have put in place the ability to collaborate online with functionality\n> and recognition/rewards (via points and badging). We have also created\n> developer councils that are held quarterly to ensure interaction with our\n> product teams and the community. We have also facilitated yearly developer\n> events for approximately 10 years—beginning with eBay DevCon and now with\n> the Innovate Developer Conference.\n\n_You have organized a developer event. What were the goals with the event and\nhow did you structure it to accomplish those goals?_\n\n> We organize a large developer event yearly. This event, called the Innovate\n> Developer Conference, was initially focused on PayPal and now includes all\n> of our properties: eBay, PayPal, X.commerce, and Magento. Our goals of the\n> conference are attendance, education (measured through surveys), and, of\n> course, a stage for product/program announcements. Events also tend to\n> provide a goal for product teams to create features to launch at the event.\n\n_How have you balanced the commercial needs of PayPal and eBay with the needs\nof the community?_\n\n> We are lucky; our organization sees the value of community. We see the value\n> of connecting people together to create monetization opportunities, value,\n> and products. We believe that the more people feel a part of and participate\n> in the community, the more value they will bring to our business units. In\n> fact, we do not require any info/login to use our tools/technologies. Only\n> when you want to test/go live and participate in community features on the\n> site are you required to register. We believe that the more people we get to\n> use our products and engage with us, the better off we are as a business. We\n> are only successful if our developers/merchants are successful, and we\n> believe that the community enables both.\n\n# Ilan Rabinovitch, Southern California Linux Expo\n\nIlan Rabinovitch is a cofounder of the Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE)\nand the Texas Linux Fest, and is a frequent contributor to community-focused\nopen source events and conferences. Ilan currently serves as president at\nLinuxFests.org, where he helps open source communities launch and operate\ntheir own events by providing fiscal sponsorship, planning support, and\nadvice.\n\nWhen not planning events and participating in open source communities, Ilan is\nemployed as a system administrator usually focusing on large-scale web\noperations; recent clients include Edmunds.com and Ooyala.\n\nWith the success of these events Ilan has earned a reputation as one of the\nmost competent event organizers in the open source community.\n\n_How did you get started in event organization?_\n\n> SCALE, the Southern California Linux Expo, has its roots in the Los Angeles\n> area Linux User Group community. Prior to starting SCALE, many of us were\n> involved of a series of events known as “LUGFests” hosted by the Simi-Conejo\n> Linux User Group in 2001 and 2002.\n>\n> LUGs or Linux User Groups were very popular in Los Angeles at the time. We\n> had about a dozen different user group meetings around the Southern\n> California area that would meet weekly to discuss Linux and open source\n> software. The LUGFests were one- and two-day events we held about once every\n> six months to bring all of these user groups together.\n>\n> The LUGFests were a great deal of fun; we held them at a venue provided by\n> Nortel. One of our user group members, Orv Beach, was the IT director for\n> the facility and arranged for us to use their cafeteria and conference rooms\n> for the event. The event included presentations by local user group members,\n> with some companies sending representatives to speak. We also had an exhibit\n> in Nortel’s cafeteria, where individuals demonstrated various open source\n> applications and Linux distributions. A few of the early open source-focused\n> companies such as VA Linux and LinuxCare sent representatives as well, but\n> the focus was mostly on Linux users showing one another projects we were\n> interested or involved in.\n\n_How did the LUGFests transition into SCALE?_\n\n> Unfortunately, after four LUGFests, the dot-com bubble burst resulted in us\n> losing the venue Nortel had previously been providing. Without a home and\n> wanting to continue organizing an open source event in Southern California,\n> we teamed up with a group of students at two local universities, UCLA and\n> USC, to start SCALE.\n>\n> When starting SCALE we came to a few realizations. The first was that\n> unfortunately there were no companies in Southern California willing to\n> donate space. This meant we would need to find ways to raise money and rent\n> space. To finance the event we began allowing companies to rent exhibitor\n> space for their products, alongside the open source projects and user groups\n> who were exhibiting.\n>\n> We also realized that we wanted a more varied group of attendees. While the\n> LUGFests primarily focused on individual users and community members, we\n> felt this new event was also a great opportunity to reach a wider audience.\n> We wanted to help grow the open source community and provide educational\n> programs for both existing and new users, while also giving us, the\n> organizers, a chance to meet developers and community leaders that rarely\n> came to Southern California Linux User Group meetings.\n\n_After the buildup, how did you start the first event?_\n\n> We proudly launched our first event in November 2002, cosponsored by USC,\n> with the slogan “We are bringing businesses, academic institutions and the\n> Linux community together in a way that no other conference does!” At the end\n> of the first event we knew we had filled a need for the local community.\n> Attendees, speakers, and exhibitors alike were asking when and where we\n> would reprise the event.\n>\n> The first SCALE in November 2002 drew in 400 attendees, 6 presentation\n> sessions, and an exhibit hall made up of 30 tabletop displays. We could not\n> have had more than 10 volunteer team members planning the event, while today\n> it takes a team of well over 40 volunteers to pull off the conference.\n>\n> By our second event, we had nearly doubled in size, so we added a 2X to our\n> name as a play on words. We had “SCALE”d to twice our original size. For a\n> while we were able to hold true to our name, doubling or tripling in size\n> annually.\n\n_How big is the event these days?_\n\n> Our 10th annual event, SCALE 10x, was 10x our original size, other than\n> possibly in our budget. The name stuck, though, and we continue to “SCALE”\n> up where we can. Our February 2011 event drew over 1,800 attendees; SCALE\n> 10x had 2,000 attendees. Our expo floor has grown from 3,840 square feet at\n> our start to 16,000 square feet today. SCALE 10x had 100 exhibitors, nearly\n> 100 speaker sessions, and 4 days of activities. This year we cohosted 15\n> community events at SCALE, outside of the main SCALE program. We had never\n> planned for SCALE to be this large, but we are proud of what it has become.\n\n_How has the event changed and grown over the years?_\n\n> While our mission remains the same, the rapid growth has changed us. SCALE\n> is no longer just an event organized by a group of local volunteers; we now\n> provide a home for at least eight other conferences organized by partners in\n> the community. This has essentially allowed us to become an incubator for\n> new events as well as offer more varied content to our attendees and\n> community.\n\n_What kinds of events does this include?_\n\n> Some examples of this have included an open source health-care track, DOHCS,\n> which eventually spun off as its own separate conference; activity days for\n> distributions such as openSUSE and Fedora; Ubucon; and others. This allows\n> us to include more niche project- or community-specific content at SCALE,\n> which might not be a good fit for the wider event.\n>\n> In addition to all of the content we added, we have also lost some. For\n> example, while local user groups used to make up a large portion of our\n> exhibit hall, we now have very few that put together a presence at the\n> event. When we first started each user group would pick a topic they wanted\n> to demonstrate and staff a demo table with their members. At some point\n> along the way, the local user group members realized they wanted to attend\n> the event rather than work it, especially when the projects they previously\n> demonstrated started to join us with their own booths. We still have one or\n> two of these user groups participate on the expo floor, but it’s down from\n> the original 10 back in 2002, to around three or four depending on the year.\n\n_You all started off as new to event coordination. What were some of the early\nmistakes you made in retrospect?_\n\n> When we started SCALE, and before that, the LUGFests, most of us had never\n> organized an event before. We were mostly college or high school kids, and\n> had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. Who knew 10 years later we\n> would still be doing this?\n>\n> The biggest mistake we made at the first SCALE was not being 100%\n> transparent with the venue about our plans. As a result, we found ourselves\n> in situations where we were overloading circuits with the power draw from\n> our expo floor, or bargaining for bandwidth at the last minute. If you have\n> found the right venue to partner with, their staff is on your side. No\n> matter how unique your event is, their staff runs events year-round and\n> likely has some insight they can offer. They want your event to be\n> successful so that you will come back and work with them again, but they\n> cannot help make that happen if they do not know the details of your\n> program.\n\n_Speaking of venues, what do you look for in the perfect venue to host SCALE?_\n\n> This has changed over the years, but at the moment the two most critical\n> factors for us are location and physical space available. The SCALE team\n> likes to stay with a given venue as long as we can, but when we move it is\n> most frequently because we either found a more accessible location or need\n> more space.\n>\n> When SCALE moved close to the Los Angeles airport, the new location made it\n> quite convenient for someone from out of town to travel to our event. As a\n> result, our attendance nearly doubled and we started to draw in attendees\n> from around the country rather than just Southern California.\n>\n> Keep in mind that while having enough space is key, having too much space\n> can also be a problem. You want to find a venue that fits your program. For\n> example, in 2006 we moved from the Los Angeles Convention Center to a\n> smaller hotel because we found that we were regularly lost in a sea of empty\n> space, or crowded out by larger events. At a hotel we fit in better, and our\n> needs were taken more seriously by the venue staff as we were a sizable\n> business for them.\n\n_Aside from space, what other considerations do you have for a venue, and what\nadvice do you have for our readers?_\n\n> When we put together our annual request for proposals, other factors we keep\n> in mind are:\n>\n> Cost\n>  \n>\n> Unless your venue is donated, renting meeting space will likely be your\n> largest expenditure. Make sure the venue fits your budget, and look for\n> hidden costs. Even free venues may have associated costs, such as requiring\n> you to use their audio/visual or catering services.\n>\n> Layout\n>  \n>\n> Are your meeting rooms easy to find? How far are your meeting rooms from\n> each other? It is important that it be easy to get between all of the rooms\n> your event will use without getting lost. If flow is not right, your event\n> can either feel empty or feel overcrowded.\n>\n> Electrical power\n>  \n>\n> One lesson we learned at the first SCALE was that electrical power is a\n> requirement that needs to be communicated clearly to a venue. We learned\n> this the hard way, when one of our exhibitors turned on their rack of\n> servers and tripped all of the breakers in the exhibit hall floor. If your\n> venue is unsure of their circuit layout or how much power they can provide,\n> insist that they hire a third-party vendor to help. Most hotels and\n> conference centers know what their capabilities are, but you never know\n> until you ask.\n>\n> Bandwidth\n>  \n>\n> SCALE attendees will use as much bandwidth as we can provide. Whether it be\n> to blog about the sessions they are in, contribute to a project in a\n> hackathon/bug jam, or to download software they learn about in a session,\n> they expect Internet service that works. Unfortunately, at many hotels or\n> convention centers your attendees will likely be sharing an Internet\n> connection with less bandwidth than they have at home. Internet connectivity\n> can also be expensive. We frequently encounter venues that will charge\n> thousands of dollars to provide a single Ethernet port, charge per\n> wireless/wired device, etc. If Internet connectivity is important to your\n> program, make sure to ask about these conditions up front and consider them\n> as you plan your budgets.\n>\n> Vendor requirements\n>  \n>\n> As a volunteer-run event, SCALE prefers to do much of our own setup,\n> teardown, wiring, and other activities. Many venues have union or vendor\n> requirements that would prevent us from performing these tasks ourselves. We\n> tend to prefer venues that offer us the most flexibility in selection of\n> vendors\n\n_Let’s move on to discuss the schedule. How do you assess the submitted papers\nto ensure that you have an interesting range of presentations?_\n\n> SCALE recruits most of our content through a call for proposals. As part of\n> this call for proposals we define a range of tracks or topics we wish to see\n> covered. This provides submitters visibility into which topics are most\n> likely to be accepted, and identifies the target audiences we as a team\n> would like to cater to each year.\n>\n> At the end of our call for proposals, we have a program committee that\n> reviews the submissions to select the sessions we feel would be the best fit\n> for our conference. We work to ensure that this committee has a diverse\n> background so that we have sufficient expertise to review each proposal.\n> Some years we do better at this than others, as our team membership changes.\n\n_How do you then select the final schedule of presentations?_\n\n> The selections generally occur in two phases. First, the team votes on each\n> of the submitted sessions to identify which they would like to see part of\n> SCALE. We then meet as a team either virtually or in person to discuss the\n> top-ranking proposals for each of the audiences or topic tracks we created.\n> This gives us a chance to ensure that we do not select 100 sessions on the\n> same topic, as well as allowing individual committee members to advocate for\n> a particular session or topic they feel was overlooked.\n>\n> We believe there is room for improvement in this system, but so far it has\n> served SCALE well.\n\n_What approaches have you used to attract the big names to come and speak at\nSCALE?_\n\n> These days SCALE has built a reputation for itself that makes it\n> significantly easier to attract speakers. But even now there are speakers\n> who elude us. We tend to work with our past attendees, speakers, and\n> exhibitors to request introductions to speakers we would like to invite, or\n> to provide references if we need them.\n>\n> Earlier in our history, we did not, however, have this advantage. To build\n> our own reputation we partnered with the University of Southern California’s\n> (USC) computer science department. They allowed us to use their name in\n> association with our event, and introduced us to their contacts, which gave\n> us some credibility with both speakers and sponsors.\n>\n> We are also lucky, however, in that our event focuses on the open source\n> community, and that with few exceptions, participants in this community are\n> easily reachable and open to being approached. Since they work in the open,\n> it is often easy to know which individuals are experts in their field. Most\n> speakers were happy to help or attend your event if their schedule allows\n> them to do so.\n\n_What advice would you give an event organizer to attract some big names to\nspeak at their event?_\n\n> The short answer is, do not be shy: if you want someone to present at your\n> event, contact them. The worst thing that can happen is that they can turn\n> you down. In your communications make sure to include all of the pertinent\n> information, such as date, location, number of expected attendees, and an\n> overview of the event format or topic. This information will help them\n> evaluate the event and determine if it is a good fit for their schedule.\n\n_How do you handle the finances for SCALE? How do you predict the costs for\nthe event and cover these costs in a way that is affordable for the community\nto join?_\n\n> From the start, the SCALE team wanted to keep the event affordable; after\n> all, our roots were in free events such as the LUGFests. For this to be\n> viable we build our budgets assuming our sponsorship packages will cover all\n> of our overhead, with attendee registration fees only being intended to\n> cover the costs of the items they receive.\n>\n> At the start of the planning cycle, usually six to eight months out, we work\n> with our individual team members to generate budgets that outline\n> expenditures we either have to make or would like to make—everything from\n> venue rentals [and] printing costs to staff lunches and attendee giveaways.\n> We then use these budgets to identify rates for sponsorship packages and\n> targets for the number of sponsors at each level.\n>\n> We then check in regularly throughout the year to see if we are meeting our\n> targets or not. In some years we have found targets were not met, so we had\n> to cut perks such as attendee t-shirts; if we find ourselves leaning the\n> other way we identify additional attendee programs we can offer or find good\n> causes where we feel the funds would be helpful.\n\n_SCALE is seen as one of the best open source community events in the United\nStates. How have you maintained the “community feel” of the event?_\n\n> I believe the largest contribution to the “community feel” is that the event\n> is organized by the community. New team members join every year to help with\n> areas they feel they can improve. As a result, everyone who attends SCALE\n> feels like they helped to make the event successful.\n>\n> Another contributing factor is that we make a strong effort to avoid undue\n> influence by sponsors in our presentation selections or programming. We\n> never allow product pitches in our conference program; these are reserved\n> for our exhibit hall. And even in the exhibit hall we make an effort to\n> ensure both the community and commercial organizations are on equal footing.\n>\n> At the start of each year, we allocate 50% of our exhibit space for use by\n> nonprofit or community organizations, with the other 50% being designated\n> for commercial use. There is no nonprofit zone: all of the groups are mixed\n> in together. We then assign different team members to recruit commercial and\n> nonprofit exhibitors, ensuring that both types of exhibitor are well\n> represented.\n>\n> This equal priority on both groups is key to our success. Commercial\n> exhibitors pick up on the community vibe from their neighbors and tailor\n> their demos and messaging accordingly, and the community exhibitors get just\n> as much attention and foot traffic from attendees as our largest commercial\n> [exhibitors].\n>\n> Finally, we build our schedule to allow attendees time to mingle and\n> interact outside of formal programming. SCALE includes 30-minute breaks\n> between our sessions to allow attendees to socialize with each other, with\n> speakers, and with exhibitors. Our attendees call this the hallway track,\n> and tell us they often learn more during these breaks than they do during\n> sessions.\n\n_What are the main things you have learned over the years about putting on a\nevent the size of SCALE?_\n\n> Remember why you started your event. As a community event, your goal is most\n> likely to provide an enticing program for your contributors and/or users.\n> Focus on them. They care most about content and activities. Build a program\n> that you would personally want to attend and participate in. By focusing on\n> the attendee experience, you will ensure they enjoy themselves and find the\n> experience to be productive. They will then return year after year.\n>\n> Event planning is hard work. Do not try to do it on your own. Unlike\n> software projects, which release when ready, your event date will come\n> whether you are ready or not. It is important to build a solid team of\n> contributors with whom you can share the load and upon whom you can rely for\n> support when you find yourself underwater.\n>\n> Much like any other project, communication is key. Make sure you meet with\n> your collaborators regularly and that everyone is clear on their roles and\n> responsibilities, and then report back regularly on progress. Your\n> colleagues will not know when you need help if they never hear from you\n> about how your projects are coming and vice versa. Similarly, your venue or\n> vendors will not know what you expect of them unless you effectively\n> communicate your requirements. Meet with both groups early and often.\n>\n> Finally, read everything carefully before you sign it. Contracts in the\n> meeting and hospitality industry can be tricky and often contain hidden\n> expenses or restrictions that may not be obvious to you at first. If you do\n> not understand something, ask other meeting planners. There are many groups\n> in this space that can provide you with advice. One such group is\n> <http://www.meetingscommunity.org/>, which maintains forums and mailing\n> lists where meeting planners can exchange ideas and ask questions.\n\n# Richard Esguerra, Humble Indie Bundle\n\nThe Humble Indie Bundle has been a unique force in presenting a collection of\nfree games in which consumers are invited to contribute financially to support\nthe project. The project has been hugely successful, earned impressive\ndonations, and launched some fantastic games and the careers of their\ndevelopers.\n\nRichard works with game developers, nonprofits, and Humble Bundle customers to\npromote awesome, cross-platform video games and support vital causes. Every\nday he enjoys a healthy mix of email correspondence, social media interaction,\nand gameplay. The gaming community is notoriously tight, with creators and\nfans interacting quite closely, and every day brings an exciting new\nopportunity for Richard to develop the scene and catalyze changes in the\noverall industry.\n\nPreviously, Richard was an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation,\nadvocating for free speech, privacy, and the spread of new business models for\ncreators, where developing and interacting with online communities was of\nvital importance in the work of defending digital civil liberties.\n\n_What is the history of the Humble Indie Bundle? Where did the idea come\nfrom?_\n\n> The cofounders of the Humble Indie Bundle originally headed up an indie game\n> studio called Wolfire Games, where they learned a lot about making games and\n> the state of the industry. They had an indie game called Lugaru, and they\n> wanted to find a way to promote it alongside the games made by their friends\n> in the indie game community. They had assessed—as Cory Doctorow and others\n> have said—that an independent creator’s number one challenge is obscurity.\n>\n> As indie game developers and geeks themselves, they had observed various\n> trends through sites like Reddit, Slashdot, Ars Technica, and so on. It was\n> clear that the gaming communities didn’t like DRM. Online sales that were\n> package deals were very popular. Pay-what-you-want seemed to be somewhat\n> hit-or-miss, but was almost always newsworthy. They were inspired by these\n> various promotions and set out to combine all of the ideas into one, big,\n> blowout Internet-melting event. That’s essentially how the Humble Indie\n> Bundle was born.\n\n_What kind of community did you set out to create?_\n\n> While at Wolfire Games, the cofounders built a focused community of gamers\n> and developers passionate about creating and contributing to the dream games\n> that they’ve always wanted. When they moved forward with the Humble Indie\n> Bundle, I think that the cofounders more or less set out to create a\n> community—out of the much broader community of PC gamers—that would love and\n> appreciate indie games. Now, the broader gaming world is starting to awaken\n> to some of those ideas and take notice that indie games can be more\n> adventurous than the typical mainstream hits.\n\n_How did you encourage people to purchase and thus support the project?_\n\n> The Humble Indie Bundle was intended to be as compelling as possible by\n> giving the gaming community an almost unprecedented good deal: pay-what-you-\n> want for several awesome games, support indie game developers and worthwhile\n> charities, and have complete control over how your purchase dollars are\n> distributed. They designed the site to be easy to use, and the founders\n> focused heavily on customer service, making sure that any potential customer\n> would have few to no barriers to deciding to participate.\n\n_How did you track the success and growth of your community?_\n\n> We publish live stats during every promotion, which lets everyone know how\n> things are going. It’s easy to see what the average price is, which\n> platform’s users (Windows, Mac, or Linux) are the most generous, and so on.\n> In the past, Windows users have led the charge in terms of number of sales,\n> but Linux users have been the most generous by far.\n>\n> Customers can sign up to receive email announcements when a new bundle goes\n> live, so that’s been another way for us to know if gamers are excited about\n> what we’re doing. We also lurk and post on Reddit, which is one of our\n> favorite online communities. A lot of the posts seem genuine, and the bad\n> apples intent on derailing discussions seem to have less of an effect there.\n\n_What opportunities and challenges have you faced with your community since\nthe project started?_\n\n> Technical support is a pretty big challenge for each bundle. Games, like all\n> software, can suffer from bugs or misconfigurations that require attention\n> and know-how to fix. As our customer base has grown, so has the need to be\n> available and responsive to our customers. At the same time, our community\n> is also really instrumental for helping us do what we can to improve the\n> state of the games, especially the Linux builds. When a user reports a bug\n> and can give us good details about how to reproduce it, it gives the\n> developer the best possible chance to squash that bug.\n\n_Have you seen people abusing the Humble Indie Bundle approach?_\n\n> We’ve had to deal with individuals using the promotion in illegitimate ways:\n> namely, buying bundles in bulk for a single cent, and attempting to use them\n> in volume to win contests run by some of the folks we work with. We\n> announced a change that requires a $1 minimum in order to be able to obtain\n> the games through the Steam game distribution platform. (As a customer, you\n> can still pay less than $1 and still receive the games as a direct download\n> from us.) So far, we’re happy to report that the community seems to be\n> supporting us with this decision.\n\n_What kind of reaction have you had from the traditional gaming world to the\nproject?_\n\n> There has been a lot of enthusiasm from all corners of the PC gaming world.\n> I think that there has always [been] a unique kind of respect for indie game\n> developers, but without a coherent context, there hasn’t always been a\n> straightforward way to support and appreciate their work. Cave Story, for\n> example, came out originally as a solo passion project of a Japanese\n> developer named Pixel. It made a huge impression as a vivid throwback to\n> platforming classics, but it was kind of a happy shock—the broader gaming\n> world didn’t know what else to do with their enthusiasm. The Humble Indie\n> Bundle and other profile-raising projects run by indie developers are\n> highlighting all the interesting creative work that’s going on, and making\n> it exciting and accessible to more gamers.\n>\n> Game creators have responded strongly as well: we have productive,\n> interesting conversations with developers and small studios every day. One\n> of the most rewarding parts of doing bundles is seeing developers rewarded\n> for taking a risk, following through with their vision, and developing a\n> game independently.\n\n# Mark Bussler, Classic Game Room\n\nVeteran filmmaker and game journalist Mark Bussler is the executive producer,\ndirector, and head writer for the Classic Game Room (CGR) video game review\nshow and series of videos that debuted in 1999 and have aired on YouTube since\nFebruary 2008. Classic Game Room now boasts a family of channels with over 315\nmillion video views and hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Fans that enjoy\nBussler’s laid-back and entertaining look at modern and retro video games\nconnect with the show through the [CGR\nwebsite](http://www.ClassicGameRoom.com) and social media outlets such as\nFacebook, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nOriginally launched in 1999, Classic Game Room was the first classic video\ngame review show on the Internet and developed a cult following before its\ncancellation in late 2000 due to lack of funding. During the years between the\nshow’s original cancellation and its relaunch on YouTube, Bussler produced and\ndirected numerous feature documentaries for DVD, HDTV, and television. With\nhis background, Bussler has grown an impressive online video community and he\noffers some fantastic insight to his work here.\n\n_What is the history of Classic Game Room? How did you get started?_\n\n> Classic Game Room was started in 1999 as a low-budget TV show on the\n> Internet. While it gained a small cult following, it was cancelled in late\n> 2000 after we could not monetize it and were unable to get funding. I ended\n> up producing documentaries for several years until late 2007 when I was\n> ready for a change and the Internet was ready to monetize online video.\n> Classic Game Room returned with new episodes in February 2008 on YouTube\n> with advertisements to support the show and an audience flocking to YouTube.\n\n_Classic Game Room has developed quite a following. Was the original plan to\ncreate this fanbase?_\n\n> Yes, it’s essential to have a fan following if you plan on making a living\n> as an artist. When you build a fanbase and work with the audience to create\n> videos that they enjoy and that you enjoy making, there’s always excitement\n> about what’s coming out next. The audience has always been very supportive\n> and they’ve kept the show growing and changing.\n\n_Has the success of the show surprised you?_\n\n> It’s taken about four years of daily hard work on YouTube since 2008 and\n> more than 12 years total to get Classic Game Room where it is now. If the\n> show is considered successful then I think it’s earned it! I am very happy\n> that a lot of people enjoy it and care enough to watch every day and take\n> input from my reviews but it’s not surprising at this point. If anything, I\n> think it should be even bigger, but I have a very long-term outlook with\n> this.\n\n_What tools and facilities (e.g., forums/social media) have you used to help\nthe Classic Game Room community keep in touch?_\n\n> Up to now, YouTube has been the primary tool that allows viewers to keep up-\n> to-date with new reviews and communicate with each other. We have forums on\n> our website and have been making a stronger push into other social media\n> outlets like Facebook and Twitter over the past year. What’s amazing is the\n> amount of time it takes to coordinate all of this and respond to people.\n> Once you pass 25,000 followers it’s nearly impossible to keep up as one\n> person. It is a company effort now as several people all work to keep\n> Classic Game Room’s 200,000+ followers updated and communicating.\n\n_How can people in your community participate and contribute to Classic Game\nRoom?_\n\n> Communication through our own website at ClassicGameRoom.com is the best\n> method to send a message because it goes directly to us. However, we have\n> increased our Facebook and Twitter presence and find those to be valuable\n> tools when connecting with fans. Viewers can also comment on videos or join\n> our forums and I try to do daily Twitter updates. Sending us messages on\n> YouTube or over Xbox and PS3 is the worst way because we can’t manage or\n> filter any of those messages.\n\n_Classic Game Room has been around for quite some time. How has the community\nfor the show changed over that time?_\n\n> The audience has definitely gotten more international and younger as the\n> years have gone by, and I think this is an Internet trend in general. We’ve\n> always had a very diverse audience that ranges from parents to college\n> students and high school students who enjoy a wide variety of gaming eras.\n\n_How have you kept your community excited and interested in Classic Game Room\nover the years?_\n\n> CGR mixes it up constantly and goes with the flow. Viewers will let you know\n> what they want to see and what they’ve enjoyed or not enjoyed. That input is\n> valuable. I also review games from the ‘70s up to the newest releases and\n> try to cover a wide variety of styles that other shows might not. The basic\n> formula hasn’t changed. Classic Game Room is about having fun when playing\n> games, whether it’s for Atari 2600 or PlayStation 3. Our audience has always\n> enjoyed that viewpoint and that’s how I review. I also cover a lot of retro\n> items that collectors and hobbyists enjoy hearing about, and thanks to eBay\n> and rereleases that’s always relevant.\n\n_Classic Game Room has used YouTube extensively for delivering content. What\nadvice would you offer other communities for delivering great content and\ngetting people to watch it?_\n\n> There’s definitely an oversaturation of content on the Internet and on\n> YouTube now, so it’s harder than ever to get noticed and break out. I would\n> recommend ignoring all “overnight successes”—you can’t predict that or what\n> will go viral; there’s nothing to learn there. Growing a successful,\n> sustainable show or blog is a lot of hard work and the tools are constantly\n> changing. I’m not sure I have good advice other than networking with like-\n> minded people, producing good content, using all of the tools available, and\n> having a realistic business plan. Producing good content alone is not\n> enough, that’s for sure. You need to do it all, and that’s a lot of work.\n\n_How do you financially support the creation of the show? Is it purely Google\nAdSense?_\n\n> In order to keep the reviews free for the viewer, Classic Game Room has been\n> entirely ad-supported up to this point. Google has certainly found ways to\n> monetize videos and website traffic, but like everything on the Internet,\n> that is constantly changing and it’s up to us to keep up. Using social media\n> tools allows us to hear from fans and it’s this relationship that keeps CGR\n> growing, entertaining, and adaptable to change. If I hear of a cool new\n> trend I’ll do the exact opposite and just assume it won’t work, so it’s\n> always a nice surprise if it does!\n\n# Mary Colvig, Mozilla\n\nMary Colvig is director of Contributor Engagement at Mozilla, maker of Firefox\nand one of the most successful open source projects in the world. Mary’s focus\nis to empower and support Mozillians around the world—people who passionately\nsupport, champion, and contribute to Mozilla.\n\nMary has been involved with Mozilla since 2005 and has a lengthy background in\nPR and community marketing. She has been the driving force behind many\ncommunity marketing efforts and is known to set the odd world record. Outside\nMozilla, Mary is an active volunteer with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s\nTeam-in-Training program and a board member for Hidden Villa, a nonprofit\neducational organization.\n\n_How did you get started working for Mozilla?_\n\n> It all started with a run. In 2005, I started training for my first Ironman\n> through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society as a volunteer fundraiser and met\n> Rafael Ebron of the Mozilla Foundation. We quickly became running buddies\n> and then colleagues when Mozilla started looking to bring on a new PR team.\n> The chance to work with an organization with not only a product I love, but\n> a mission and not-for-profit focus, was too great. It combined all my\n> passions in one, and I ended up leading Mozilla’s PR team.\n>\n> I beat Rafael at Ironman Canada 2005, but it didn’t jeopardize my work with\n> Mozilla, luckily. In 2006, I joined as a paid staff member to round out the\n> marketing team of three.\n\n_Mozilla set out with a brave goal for Firefox. How did you start building\nyour community?_\n\n> Our community traces its roots back to 1998 when Netscape created the\n> Mozilla project, a free and open source project chartered to create the\n> next-generation Internet suite for Netscape. Within the first year of its\n> creation the Mozilla project drew community members from around the world\n> who helped not only to enhance functionality of the browser, but contribute\n> to planning and overall management of the project and create a variety of\n> new browsers.\n>\n> The Mozilla community started to really gain momentum around the launch of\n> Firefox 1.0.\n>\n> The first steps we took in building a Firefox community were bringing in a\n> few very talented volunteer engineers, Pierre Chanail, Mike Connor, Blake\n> Ross, and others, to help us build a great product. No matter how passionate\n> a community you have, if you don’t have a product that makes a difference in\n> users’ lives, you’re not going to achieve great success.\n>\n> But even with a great product, we were stuck if people didn’t know about it.\n> At this point in time, more people had come online after the death of\n> Netscape than had ever been online during the browser wars. However, most\n> folks didn’t know what a browser was or how to download an alternative\n> browser, presenting a challenge for us.\n\n_How did you reach out to these folks?_\n\n> In the summer of 2004, Blake Ross and Asa Dotzler started an effort to reach\n> out to bloggers who were saying good things about Firefox and ask them to\n> put up a “download Firefox” button on their site. We needed to distribute\n> the work to make an impact with this campaign, so Blake and Asa blogged,\n> asking for volunteer help in building a tool to manage this process. That\n> was the beginning of Spread Firefox.\n>\n> Spread Firefox became the engagement hub for Mozilla—the first large-scale\n> community-based marketing effort the Web had ever seen. It grew to tens of\n> thousands of members in just a few months and was the launch point for such\n> campaigns as the New York Times Project, Firefox Flicks, and the Download\n> Day campaign that set a Guinness Book record for most software downloads in\n> a single day.\n\n_Mozilla has both a contributor and end-user community. What approaches have\nyou used for growing both?_\n\n> We consider everyone that chooses to use Firefox and Mozilla products as\n> valuable members of our community. Whether or not end users realize it,\n> choosing to use Firefox and share it with friends and family is critical to\n> advancing our mission to create a thriving Web.\n>\n> From a product standpoint, we make our users stakeholders. We encourage and\n> enable users to customize Firefox and to take part in test driving and\n> providing feedback on our products. This is everything from thousands of\n> add-ons to a button built right into Firefox to provide direct feedback.\n>\n> Our marketing efforts aren’t traditional, either; we aim to build a personal\n> rapport and create programs that allow users to show their support and feel\n> a part of the overall Firefox community. This spans simple programs like our\n> Affiliates buttons (website badges used to drive downloads), to collectively\n> setting a Guinness World Record, to our Join Us membership program. We now\n> have hundreds of millions of users and over 10 million direct relationships.\n>\n> In terms of growing our contributor community, the principles are fairly\n> similar in how we approach users. We work to have a compelling mission and\n> live up to it everyday, build great products and technologies, provide\n> opportunities for people to participate, and foster relationships.\n\n_How have you kept your community excited and interested in participating?_\n\n> Foremost, it’s critical that our mission and how we fulfill it has stayed\n> relevant and compelling. We’re one of the largest and most successful open\n> source projects in the world and we’ve empowered millions of people to take\n> control of their online experience, and we’re continuing to evolve to keep\n> shaping the future of the Web for the public good. This keeps people\n> engaged.\n>\n> This means expanding our scope, including Firefox for mobile, Identity and\n> Apps, as well as initiatives around media and education. This provides\n> volunteers and paid staff alike the chance to explore new opportunities and\n> keep learning. At the same time, as Firefox adoption has grown, our\n> community has had the chance to see their hard work end up in front of\n> hundreds of millions of people. That’s pretty compelling.\n\n_What glue have you used to keep your contributors together?_\n\n> In addition to new products and initiatives, we’ve worked hard this year to\n> get programs and infrastructure in place that support Mozillians. This\n> includes creating a learning and development team that will support all\n> Mozillians, building out a community directory to allow us to easily find\n> one another, a Mozilla Reps program to better support advocacy activities\n> and provide growth opportunities, and more.\n>\n> Ultimately, we’re a people-powered organization, so taking the time to\n> foster relationships, socialize face-to-face, have fun, and see your work\n> make an impact are just as important as any volunteer management structure.\n\n_Mozilla (the company) has grown significantly over the years. How have you\nbalanced the relationship between company and community?_\n\n> Here at Mozilla we don’t see a delineation between the “company” and the\n> “community”—we’re all Mozillians. The Mozilla community comprises thousands\n> of paid staff and volunteers working in concert to put millions of people in\n> control of their online experience. This provides us a hybrid workforce of\n> incredibly invested individuals—some paid and some not—that allow us to have\n> [a] major impact on the Web. We work very hard to foster an inclusive\n> community; each and every Mozillian should consider themselves a community\n> manager. We all need to help on-ramp and support people trying to make an\n> impact in our functional or regional areas. In turn, our company is here to\n> support this overall community.\n\n_What challenges have you faced in this work?_\n\n> Obviously, our rapid growth hasn’t been without its bumps over the last\n> years. Like any rapidly growing organization, we’ve had our growing pains.\n> It’s impossible to keep track of everything that is going on and this can be\n> uncomfortable at times. As we’ve grown in number and we’ve taken on more\n> ambitious projects, many of us have found ourselves in the position of\n> having to narrow our focus, delegate, and make room for new people. This can\n> be unnerving for anyone, whether you’re a volunteer or paid staff. However,\n> the influx of so many new people, skills, and intelligence will help us meet\n> the new challenges that face us.\n\n_How have you handled the on-boarding of people who have come from outside\ntraditional open source and web development communities?_\n\n> The growing popularity and awareness of Firefox has drawn more and more\n> people interested in making a difference on the Web. At the same time, the\n> expanding scope of the Mozilla project has resulted in many more avenues for\n> involvement and lower barriers to entry. It can be a challenge for any\n> would-be contributor to make sense of all these opportunities and get\n> started. We’re finding we have a discoverability and on-boarding problem\n> across all our functional areas that impacts potential volunteers from all\n> backgrounds.\n>\n> We’re focusing efforts on identifying these contribution efforts, creating\n> clear contribution paths and matching people in literally every functional\n> area, from legal to coding to marketing to localization and more. Most of\n> this can be fairly low-touch: being rigorous about documenting contribution\n> opportunities and how-to guides, as well as revamping our main online\n> touchpoints to find easy ways to get involved. However, most of us joined\n> Mozilla based on a relationship or another Mozillian reaching out and\n> providing a helping hand.\n>\n> It’s important to not lose sight of this, but [to] explore ways to make this\n> more scalable, and it goes back to my point about each and every Mozillian\n> needing to be a community manager. To increase our reach and touch, we\n> launched our Mozilla Reps program which is essentially a field organization\n> of experienced Mozillians charged with advocating for Mozilla, bringing in\n> new contributors and mentoring them. We’re also experimenting with new\n> things like mentored first “bugs” and how we might leverage and host\n> thousands of small events and meet-ups to introduce Mozilla. It should be\n> easy for anyone to join Mozilla and make a difference!\n\n# Dries Buytaert, Drupal and Acquia\n\nDries Buytaert is the original creator and project lead for the Drupal open\nsource web publishing and collaboration platform. Dries also serves as\npresident of the Drupal Association, a nonprofit organization formed to help\nDrupal flourish.\n\nHe is also cofounder and chief technology officer of Acquia, a venture-backed\nsoftware company that offers products and services for Drupal. In addition, he\nis a cofounder of Mollom, a web service that helps you identify content\nquality and, more importantly, helps you stop website spam. A native of\nBelgium, Dries holds a Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from Ghent\nUniversity and a licentiate in computer science (MsC) from the University of\nAntwerp. In 2008, Dries was named one of the Best Young Tech Entrepreneurs by\n_BusinessWeek_ and made _Technology Review_ ’s annual list of 35 Innovators\nUnder 35.\n\n_What is the history of the Drupal project?_\n\n> I started work on Drupal in 2000. I had a need for a private message board\n> and at the same time wanted to learn PHP and MySQL, two relatively new\n> technologies at the time. Instead of using an existing message board, I\n> decided to write my own, so I could learn about PHP and MySQL.\n>\n> Back then, Drupal didn’t have a name as I was only using it on my sites;\n> first my dorm room’s intranet and later <http://drop.org>. Drop.org evolved\n> from a message board into an experimental platform where I played with new\n> technologies like RSS, RDF, “public diaries” (which later became blogs),\n> user ratings, and more. As I added functionality, my message board system\n> evolved into a content management system, or CMS.\n>\n> Furthermore, I started to use Drop.org to write and to highlight other\n> trends on the Web. Slowly, Drop.org started to attract an audience of people\n> interested in the future of the Web. Some visitors would write to ask for\n> the source code behind Drop.org. Other visitors would suggest new features\n> for Drop.org.\n\n_How did your project transition into the Drupal we know and love today?_\n\n> In January 2001, I decided to release the source code behind Drop.org as\n> open source. I named it “Drupal,” as a play on the word _druppel_ , which is\n> Dutch for “drop.” I didn’t have big plans for Drupal. I just wanted to share\n> the code because people were interested. I expected maybe a dozen people\n> would download and use it.\n>\n> In the early days I focused, completely and utterly, on the aesthetics of\n> Drupal’s code. I spent days trying to do something better, with fewer lines\n> of code, and more elegant than elsewhere. For that reason, I didn’t care to\n> maintain backward compatibility either. It felt is was the right thing to\n> do.\n\n_What kind of community did you set out to create?_\n\n> Early contributors to Drupal were developers. They fell in love with Drupal\n> because it implemented state-of-the-art web technologies, and it did so [in\n> a cleaner], more flexible, and more performant [way] than most other open\n> source CMSes. I gave them free reign to implement their ideas in the best\n> possible way, even if that negatively impacted Drupal’s usability.\n\n_How did these developers start collaborating with you and with one another?_\n\n> Initially, other developers would just email me patches. Then I set up a\n> mailing list where we would exchange patches. When that stopped scaling, we\n> decided to use CVS to exchange patches. Eventually, we built our own bug\n> tracking and code sharing tools on Drupal.org.\n>\n> Even today, the Drupal community is very developer-focused. I no longer\n> think that is best for a tool like Drupal, and so for many years many of us\n> have been actively recruiting designers, usability experts, [and]\n> information architects to Drupal. The best communities are well-rounded.\n\n_How big is the Drupal community?_\n\n> It wasn’t until Drupal was four years old that I gave my first presentation\n> about Drupal. To the best of my knowledge, that was really the first time\n> that more than 20 Drupal contributors got together in person. It was a lot\n> of fun, and made me decide to organize the first Drupal Conference in\n> Antwerp, my hometown. Five years into Drupal, about 40 people showed up in\n> Antwerp. More than 3,000 people attended DrupalCon Chicago in 2011, and each\n> conference keeps on growing.\n>\n> Our website, Drupal.org, gets more than 1 million unique visitors per month.\n> Every month, thousands of people contribute to Drupal development on\n> Drupal.org. Together, we’ve created over 12,000 modules that can be used to\n> extend Drupal. About 1,000 people got patches accepted into Drupal 7 core.\n> It is a legendary piece of work, by the community, for the community. We\n> celebrated the release with 248 parties in 88 countries.\n\n_Do you feel that open source really empowered your community to grow like\nthis?_\n\n> Open source is the best way to build and distribute software. In some but\n> not all cases, open source provides viable business models. An important\n> reason why the Drupal community is so large is that we managed to create a\n> large commercial ecosystem around Drupal. There are thousands of developers\n> making a living with Drupal, and because of that they have a vested interest\n> in helping to maintain and advance Drupal.\n>\n> I don’t see Drupal’s growth stopping soon. First of all, the Web continues\n> to expand. Second, in a world where websites become increasingly complex, it\n> becomes less and less attractive to develop a website when you can assemble\n> one by leveraging thousands of modules. Open source content management\n> systems are disrupting the traditional content management industry and\n> driving proprietary players to niche markets. All things combined, I think\n> Drupal could easily grow into a billion-dollar industry over the [coming]\n> years.\n\n_With a community as large as Drupal, how did you handle the scale as it\ngrew?_\n\n> At each step in our growth, we had to scale all aspects of the project; our\n> tools, our methodologies, our infrastructure, our conferences, etc.\n> Sometimes you can scale by automating things or by creating more\n> efficiencies in how you work, but more often you have to scale by building a\n> great team. You want to surround yourself with talented and passionate\n> people, empower them, and transfer responsibilities to them. Then encourage\n> them to do the same.\n>\n> When Drupal was small, I wrote all the code, read all the support questions,\n> and managed the infrastructure. Today, we have thousands of volunteers that\n> contribute to different aspects of Drupal. I only review other people’s code\n> and barely code myself, and I don’t think I can actually log in to our\n> servers anymore. It’s hard to let go of things that you are passionate\n> about, but you have to if you’re going to scale. This is true for everyone\n> in the Drupal project, not just for me.\n\n_How did you govern and manage the community as it scaled up?_\n\n> We govern the technical aspect from the project separately from the\n> logistical aspects.\n>\n> For the logistical aspects, I cofounded the Drupal Association. The Drupal\n> Association currently employs more than five full-time staff [members]. They\n> work with the larger Drupal community to maintain our server infrastructure,\n> to organize several Drupal conferences each year, and more. The direction\n> for the Drupal Association is set by its board of directors, of which I’m\n> president. It is not always easy, but we elect the board of directors such\n> that they represent the different aspects of our community. By doing so, we\n> make sure that the Drupal Association serves the needs of the community, and\n> not the other way around.\n>\n> What makes the Drupal Association special is that it has no influence over\n> the technical direction of Drupal. The Drupal community uses a do-ocracy\n> model, meaning people work on what they want to work on, instead of being\n> told what to work on. Decisions are usually made through consensus building\n> and based on technical merit, trust, and respect. As the project lead, and\n> with the help of my comaintainers, I help guide the community in strategic\n> directions.\n>\n> As a BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) I can veto certain decisions, or\n> more importantly, I can make decisions when the community gets stuck. This\n> happens, for example, when there are two competing implementations for a\n> particular feature and the community can’t agree on which proposed\n> architecture is better.\n\n_How have you balanced the community relationship and investment from Acquia?_\n\n> While Acquia may be the largest contributor to Drupal, it is still only one\n> of many. Only a small percentage of all code contributions come from Acquia.\n>\n> My priority is to help make sure that Drupal is successful. That happens to\n> align well with my role at Acquia. Quite simply, Drupal has to be successful\n> for Acquia to be successful. I believe this strongly enough that I would\n> make decisions that negatively impact Acquia if it is the best decision for\n> Drupal.\n>\n> Before [I started] Acquia, Drupal was a hobby project. In other words,\n> Acquia has allowed me to do more. I’m able to work on Drupal more than I\n> would have if I’d continued Drupal as a hobby project. I also believe that\n> my role at Acquia has only helped me do a better job as the project lead.\n> Acquia has enabled me to get closer to end users of all kinds. I travel to\n> more Drupal events and interact with more Drupal users and developers.\n>\n> I love that, as a company, we can do well and can do good at the same time.\n> A lot of the venture capital money we raised has flown back into the Drupal\n> project or has been used to create awareness for Drupal. Everyone benefits\n> from that.\n\n# James Spafford, Media Molecule\n\nJames started a 12-year career in the game industry as a game tester, but\npursued his passion for online communities and landed roles in community\nmanagement and content writing at MMO publisher NCsoft.\n\nJames joined MediaMolecule, creator of the hugely popular LittleBigPlanet\ngames for the PlayStation 3, PSP, Vita, and other devices. The LittleBigPlanet\nfranchise built a new community by providing gamers with the ability to create\nlevels and content collaboratively and share it in an online gaming universe.\nThis provided a fascinating and ground-breaking community case study.\n\nAfter falling in love with LittleBigPlanet, James dived into the existing\nLittleBigPlanet community, building various LittleBigPlanet websites with a\nfriend and former colleague. These grabbed the attention of some people at\nMedia Molecule, who after a bit of nudging, gave them both jobs.\n\nJames lives on the Internet, and got a taste for community management and web\ncontent creation after founding his first fan site at the age of 16, later\ngoing on to cofound the cult editorial gaming site Idle Thumbs. He’d love to\nadd that he’s into mountain climbing, kayaking, and other exciting things, but\nin reality he spends most of his time either on a train to and from work,\nliterally feeding his obsession with delicious food and drink, or on the\nInternet playing games.\n\n_When you were conceiving the LittleBigPlanet community, what goals and\nintentions did you set out to achieve?_\n\n> I joined Media Molecule (Mm) shortly after LittleBigPlanet’s launch, forming\n> a small community team with my friend, Mm Designer Tom Kiss, so the\n> community had already been conceived to a certain point. At the time, most\n> communication about the game came from Media Molecule’s own blog, as there\n> were no official LBP destinations for reaching out to the players, other\n> than some outdated marketing sites—Flash-based media-heavy sites with no\n> customer interactivity.\n>\n> As such, the community was quite spread out, and news seemed to come from\n> many different sources. Our first steps were about [ensuring that] we had\n> the basics of community covered: we reclaimed Littlebigplanet.com, and built\n> a community-focused website for people to gather around—a place to get news,\n> media, and support.\n>\n> We also needed to make sure we had a voice in various social media places,\n> like Twitter and Facebook, and also within the established fan communities,\n> so we could talk to people where they were already hanging out.\n>\n> With all this in place, we could write news, talk to players, hold contests,\n> and also we were able to start addressing a bigger and steadily growing\n> issue...\n\n_What issue was that?_\n\n> LittleBigPlanet is all about being able to create your own things and share\n> them with others. The aim was to bring creative people together, and to help\n> people find great new things to play online.\n>\n> Before the game launched, the team had little idea just how successful it\n> was going to be, if anyone would participate at all...It turned out to be\n> far more successful than they ever envisioned. Within six months over a\n> million levels had been shared online. The systems designed to help people\n> find the good stuff had only really been tested with hundreds of levels, not\n> millions, so they needed some urgent attention.\n>\n> We were able to help shape an improved set of in-game tools which we\n> steadily built on and finally completely overhauled for LittleBigPlanet 2.\n> Additionally, though, we developed another community destination to address\n> the problem: [LBP.me](http://lbp.me).\n>\n> LBP.me takes all the creations made in LittleBigPlanet and serves them onto\n> the Web. Every player and every level has a unique short URL, complete with\n> useful info like screenshots and reviews, plus the ability to queue a level\n> for play when you next turn on the game. LBP.me made sharing creations with\n> others a lot easier, and combined with friend feeds, also available online,\n> it serves as a vital tool to help you find the levels you actually want to\n> play amongst the nearly 6 million levels now available.\n\n_How did you want to differentiate the LittleBigPlanet community from other\nonline gaming communities?_\n\n> One of the main things I specifically wanted to ensure was that the\n> community had a spirit that reflected that of the game: one of collaboration\n> and sharing.\n>\n> Lots of online communities can be very competitive, especially between\n> different fan sites and groups, and I wanted to try and have the spirit of\n> sharing be the overwhelming feeling. We tried to always be as inclusive as\n> possible, and work to make people feel like they were part of one big group\n> of friends. I think we achieved that quite well; community sites hold\n> interlinking contests, share resources, link to one another, and generally\n> act friendly towards one another, so it feels like that worked for the most\n> part. Of course, there are occasional feuds, but less so than any other\n> community I’ve worked with, for sure.\n>\n> A cute way we tried to encourage this at the start was by bringing back the\n> web-ring, a forgotten feature of the Web, and something that every website\n> used to belong to. We gave it a twist, though: the widget which you had to\n> put onto your own site in order to be part of it would recommend another\n> random site for people to visit, and the index of all the sites was always\n> random. We didn’t want any elitist top-sites lists, just sharing.\n\n_With such a diverse and often very young audience, how have you kept\ncommunity conduct and the content produced clean, and how have you avoided\nporn, spam, and other inappropriate content?_\n\n> We have an easy-to-use reporting tool in-game, reflected on the Web, too,\n> that allows people to report inappropriate or offensive levels, and these\n> are then moderated by teams based within the various Sony Computer\n> Entertainment offices in each region around the world.\n>\n> This system generally keeps naughty things out of sight; largely, though,\n> we’ve found that people have a desire to contribute positively to the\n> LittleBigPlanet. I think the game’s charm works wonders on people; it’s what\n> embodies the spirit that I was so keen to have the community reflect.\n\n_What day-to-day work do you need to do as a community manager for a gaming\ncommunity?_\n\n> It can differ quite a bit depending on the game type, or if you are based at\n> a publisher or at a developer, but in general it’s probably not too\n> different from any online community management. You are the conduit between\n> the people playing and the people making the game. This means a lot of\n> scouring on forums and social media to see what the mood is or if anything\n> unusual is happening, and using those same channels of communication to let\n> people know about cool events or issues they may encounter, etc. I talk to a\n> lot of people, write content for the Web, plan events, etc.\n>\n> As I’m based within the development team, it also means that some of my day\n> can involve working on the game itself, and helping to devise the parts of\n> the game that will have [an] impact on the community, or will hook into\n> things we will build on the Web—for instance, designing the ratings and\n> review systems for levels, or designing the in-game social systems.\n>\n> I guess the main benefit of it being a [gaming] community over any other one\n> is that I get to play the game [a lot]...and as our game is about allowing\n> people to make other games, it never gets old!\n\n_Your community has scaled hugely, yet Media Molecule is a small studio. How\nhave you coped with the scale?_\n\n> Keeping Mm small has been a tough job all round, and we rely on our friends\n> at Sony for lots of things, but we also get by with a little help from our\n> friends, quite literally. In terms of development we outsource some things\n> to friendly local companies, or other cool folk we are fans of. Community is\n> no different, but our friends are key members of our community that we can\n> rely on to talk to us regularly, and notify us if things are going wrong, if\n> they have a cool thing that needs to be promoted, or if we missed something\n> we need to do something about!\n>\n> I would say that surrounding yourself with active and helpful people from\n> the community is essential for any community manager, especially one on a\n> small team. They’re often quite obvious standout people who contribute a\n> lot, or seem to post in every thread. Getting these people on your side is\n> fairly easy as they are fans to begin with, and keeping them there is very\n> beneficial. Plus, you get to make new friends, and possibly even new\n> employees.\n\n_With LittleBigPlanet you can create content that is shared publicly. What\nchallenges have you seen with how people perceive the ownership and the rights\nthey have over such content, and how have you managed these expectations and\nchallenges?_\n\n> When someone creates something, [even] if a legal agreement means they lose\n> ownership of it by uploading it to a server, they still perceive it as\n> theirs; after all, they made it!\n>\n> A real challenge we’ve faced there is in the moderation service that takes\n> down naughty levels. With the current moderation system, there is no\n> communication between a player and the moderator when their level is\n> removed.\n>\n> Whilst lots of people will know exactly why their creation is gone, because\n> they obviously broke the rules, there are still cases where people do not\n> understand what has happened to _their_ level, and sadly won’t be able to\n> find out either, which can, quite understandably, result in hurt feelings.\n>\n> Ideally, I’d much prefer a more open solution, where people can easily get\n> feedback on why their creation has been censored, and be able to talk to a\n> real person about their problems and to find out how to fix them.\n\n_What have been the main lessons learned throughout your experience of\nbuilding the LittleBigPlanet community?_\n\n> As a team we’ve learned a great deal about providing a service to people\n> versus selling a game to people. Whilst LittleBigPlanet is a video game on a\n> console, it’s also a platform for people to Play, Create, and Share their\n> own creations, and as such it needs to feature the same tools and services\n> that any similar platform, such as YouTube or Flickr, might provide.\n> LittleBigPlanet is also very similar to a massively multiplayer online (MMO)\n> game in many aspects, and in an ideal world would carry the same level of\n> ongoing support and service that is common in the MMO world: more two-way\n> support for player issues, fast bug fixing, etc.\n>\n> We’ve also learned lessons about how people relate to their creations, and\n> share them. Once someone has spent 40 hours making something, they are going\n> to be proud of it, and they will want to share it with people, and show off.\n> They will want to share it with people who might not be able to see it if it\n> just exists inside a game world. Getting these creations out of the game and\n> onto the Web allows people to share far more easily, in places where they\n> like to hang out with their non-LittleBigPlanet friends. For us, LBP.me was\n> our solution, and we very much consider it an extended part of the game\n> design itself.\n>\n> We’re always watching and learning, and iterating on our designs as the\n> community evolves, so we can build a better and more enjoyable experience,\n> and everything we have learned will be applied to our future projects.\n>\n> Personally, I’ve learned that a simple game about playing, creating, and\n> sharing can have some wonderful effects on people’s lives, and that I’m very\n> lucky to have worked with a community of lovely, creative people who seem to\n> be able to blow my mind on an almost daily basis!\n\n\n# Chapter 15. Onward and Upward\n\n“Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an\nactivity but in doing it.”\n\n—Greg Anderson\n\nAnd this, my friends, brings us to the end of the first part of our journey.\nWay back in [Chapter 1](ch01.html \"Chapter 1. The Art of Community\") we\nstarted with a bird’s-eye view of community, and we have gradually zoomed in\ncloser and closer to look at the day-to-day details. Throughout our journey,\nwe have talked through the major topics in building a strong community.\n\nWhen I conceived the content for this book, I was keen to put together a solid\nfoundation to get the new community manager, leader, or organizer up and\nrunning as quickly as possible. I wanted to cover a diverse range of topics\nwithout bogging you down with impractical details and academic hand waving.\nWith these goals in mind, I am proud of the outcome: I think _The Art of\nCommunity_ provides the springboard to help you all build great communities.\n\nThis is only the beginning, though. The French critic and poet Paul Valery\nonce said, “A poem is never finished, only abandoned,” and the same can be\nsaid of this book.\n\nCommunity management, leadership, and organization is a new and young science.\nThere is still a long road ahead and many things to learn on the way. The\nfirst edition of _The Art of Community_ was part one in an ongoing journey to\ndocument the art of building strong and effective communities. This second\nedition has brought a raft of updates and new content, but the content here is\nstill a snapshot of knowledge that is begging to be extended and augmented as\nwe explore the road ahead and discover more answers about this sometimes\nstrange but always fascinating science.\n\nAs we close this edition, I want to share some other resources that can help\nyou to continue on your journey.\n\n# Building Our Own Community\n\nSince the first edition of _The_ _Art_ _of Community_ , I have maintained a\n[website for the book](http://www.artofcommunityonline.org), with updates,\narticles, and a place for you all to share your feedback.\n\nThe goal of the website is to not only provide a place to find out about the\nbook, but also share interesting news, stories, articles, and feedback about\ntopics related to community management and leadership. The website is highly\nsocial and you can share your comments, ideas, and thoughts throughout the\ndifferent articles that are present on the site.\n\n## Social Media\n\nYou can also keep up-to-date with the community surrounding _The Art of\nCommunity_ across a range of social media resources. Each resource is\nregularly updated with news about the book, interesting articles, reviews, and\nmore. They also provide a great way to get in touch with me and discuss\ncommunity management. This includes:\n\nTwitter\n\n    \n\n<http://www.twitter.com/artofcommunity>\n\nFacebook\n\n    \n\n<http://www.facebook.com/artofcommunity>\n\nGoogle+\n\n    \n\n<https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/105128579377492328643/me/posts>\n\nIf you want to keep up-to-date with me and my work, be sure to check out these\nresources:\n\nBlog/home page\n\n    \n\n<http://www.jonobacon.org>\n\nTwitter\n\n    \n\n<http://www.twitter.com/jonobacon>\n\nFacebook\n\n    \n\n<http://www.facebook.com/jonobacon>\n\nGoogle+\n\n    \n\n<https://plus.google.com/u/0/114419073019603780828/posts>\n\nLinkedIn\n\n    \n\n<http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jono-bacon/0/32a/b61>\n\n## Videos\n\nI have also created a YouTube channel that is regularly updated with videos\nabout community management, leadership, and other topics, including many of\nthe topics covered in this book.\n\nYou can find the channel and subscribe to it at:\n\n<http://www.youtube.com/jonobacon>\n\n# The Community Leadership Summit\n\nAs discussed earlier in the book, I wanted to write _The Art of Community_ not\nonly to provide one person’s thesis on how to build and grow a productive and\ninspiring community, but also to use the book to trigger more discussion about\ncommunity management ideas, best practices, and approaches. As I settled into\nthe brutal writing schedule, I was excited about the book, but I still felt\nlike something was missing. Seemingly being someone who prefers to replace\nsleep for heartburn, I decided there was one additional thing I wanted to work\non: a central event and meeting place for community managers.\n\nLike many community managers, I had traveled around the world, trudging from\nconference to conference to talk up my communities, but I had little\nopportunity to sit down with other community managers, including those from\ncompeting companies, to discuss our craft. Back then, community management was\nstill very much in its infancy, so I assumed the attendance would be fairly\nsmall, and an intimate event could generate some really great discussion.\n\nAnd thus the Community Leadership Summit was born. From its humble beginnings\nin 2009, the event has been run each year with over 200 attendees from a\nvariety of different industries, projects, perspectives, and backgrounds\ncoming together to share ideas and best practices. The event has even inspired\nother smaller, regional Community Leadership Summit events, too.

This group photo shows many of the attendees from the 2011\nCommunity Leadership Summit event.\n\nThe event is designed to bring together people like you and me to discuss,\ndebate, and share our journey in learning how to build community.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe Community Leadership Summit is a free event that usually takes place in\nPortland, Oregon (although this may have changed by the time you read this).\nThe event is open to anyone who wants to participate, and it provides a\ncombination of an open and scheduled agenda.\n\nMost of the schedule is organized as an _unconference_ ; this means the\nschedule is open at the beginning of each day, and attendees can suggest\ntopics and volunteer to run sessions. This approach to scheduling generates a\nmuch more diverse set of topics and content, and is much more reactive to\nareas of interest in community management and leadership. As an example, here\nare some topics from the last event:\n\n  * Top 10 Tips for Growing Your Community\n\n  * Mentoring: Recruiting New Community Members\n\n  * Offline Communities to Online Tribes\n\n  * Killer Collaboration\n\n  * The Zen of Conflict\n\n  * Fostering a Community As a Company of One\n\n  * Community and the Corporate Fortress\n\n  * Giving Props: Building Incentives and Recognition\n\nImportantly, _everyone_ is welcome to organize and run a session; an important\npart of the Community Leadership Summit ethos is that the event should be open\nto all and provide an environment where everyone can contribute interesting\nideas and content.\n\nThis open schedule is also augmented with some scheduled sessions around areas\nof interest to community managers and leaders. This includes presentations and\nlightning talks; and we have even had a stand-up comedy routine in the past,\ntoo!\n\nFinally, the Community Leadership Summit is a very social event. It is a great\nopportunity to meet other community managers and leaders between sessions,\nduring breaks, and at the evening events that we organize.\n\n## Joining Us\n\nIf you would like to attend the next Community Leadership Summit, go to\n<http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/> to find out when the next event\nwill be held.

We do this just so that\nwe know approximately how many attendees are joining us at the event.\n\n# Keeping in Touch\n\nSo, without further ado, it is time to close this book and go out there and\nbuild an incredible community.

But the question is, how do you actually lead that way? How\ndoes a leader give up so much power for something that looks like chaos? How\ndo you get the leap in performance that comes from unleashing people’s passion\nand creativity? Jim Whitehurst’s interesting tale of his own reinvention as a\nleader, with lessons from other leaders in companies such as Whole Foods,\nPixar, Zappos, and others, finally provides the blueprint that leaders have\nbeen seeking.”\n\n> —CHRIS ANDERSON, cofounder and CEO, 3D Robotics; former Editor in Chief,\n> Wired magazine\n\n“Many people are wary of change.

For executives\nwho worry about Millennial employees and the power of the internet, it is\nscary indeed. Yet those same employees could offer valuable new perspectives,\nideas, and passion. The question is, how do today’s managers capture those\ndesirable attributes without setting off the perfect storm? The answers are in\nJim Whitehurst’s book The Open Organization: Igniting Passion and\nPerformance.”\n\n> —JEANIE DANIEL DUCK, former Senior Partner and Managing Director, The Boston\n> Consulting Group; author, The Change Monster\n\n“In today’s disruptive economy, only the leaders—and their organizations—who\nare open and learn to adapt to the fast-changing needs of customers and\nemployees will survive.

The human capabilities that are most critical to\nsuccess—the ones that can help your organization become more resilient, more\ncreative, and more, well, awesome—are precisely the ones that can’t be\n“managed.” While you can compel financially dependent employees to be obedient\nand diligent, and can recruit the most intellectually capable, you can’t\ncommand initiative, creativity, or passion. These human capabilities are,\nquite literally, gifts. Every day employees choose whether to bring them to\nwork or leave them at home. Suppliers and customers make similar decisions—to\nengage with your enterprise in a spirit of true collaboration or apply their\nenergies elsewhere. As a leader, how do you create an environment that\ninspires people to volunteer those “gifts”?\n\nNearly fifty years ago, Warren Bennis, the much-missed leadership guru,\npredicted that we’d soon be working in “organic-adaptive structures,”\norganizations that feel like communities, not hierarchies. In a community, the\nbasis for loyalty is a common purpose, not economic dependency. Control comes\nfrom shared norms and aspirations, not from policies and bosses. Rewards are\nmostly intrinsic rather than extrinsic. Contributions aren’t predetermined and\nindividuals are free to contribute as they may. Examples are as diverse as a\nmeeting of Alcoholics Anonymous or a team erecting a house for Habitat for\nHumanity.\n\nBennis had a compelling vision, but until recently it was hard to believe that\ncommunity-centric structures could ever scale. Then came the internet. The\ndefining characteristic of the internet is its openness. Online, human beings\nare free to connect, contribute, and create as never before, and billions of\nthem have exploited that opportunity. Consider YouTube. Every minute, more\nthan a hundred hours of content are posted to YouTube, and each month, more\nthan 6 billion hours of video are consumed by viewers from around the world.\nYouTube is open; anyone can contribute, and at present, more than a million\ncontributors make money from content they’ve uploaded to the site.\n\nI’m old enough to remember when networks were closed. Thirty years ago, if you\nwanted to add another telephone to your home, you leased it from the network\noperator—be it AT&T, BT, Bell Canada, or any other telco. Moreover, your phone\nwas a dumb device. All the intelligence resided in the giant computers that\nrouted your calls. To add a new service, like call-waiting, the operator had\nto reprogram the central switch, an expensive and risky endeavor. Screw it up\nand you could bring down the whole network. Not surprisingly, innovation\nproceeded at a snail’s pace. Today, the web hosts hundreds of web-based\ncommunication services including Apple’s iMessage, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Kakao\nTalk, Google Hangout, WeChat, and Grasshopper. On Skype alone, users spend\nmore than 2 billion minutes communicating each day.\n\nThe web has also spawned thousands of special interest groups, like\n[wrongplanet.net](http://wrongplanet.net), a site dedicated to improving the\nlives of individuals with autism. The community’s eighty thousand members have\nposted more than 1.2 million comments on the site’s general discussion board.\nIn many important respects, the web is a community of communities.\n\nUnlike your organization, the web’s architecture is end-to-end rather than\ncenter-to-end. That’s what makes it adaptable, captivating, and a platform for\ninnovation. Not surprisingly, many have been bullish about the opportunity to\nreplace bureaucracy with web-style collaboration. Thus far, though, the\nreality hasn’t matched the hype.\n\nA wiki can surface new options, but it can’t manage a global product launch. A\n“smart mob” can oust a dictator, but it can’t organize itself to collect the\ngarbage and keep the trains running. The wisdom of the crowd can predict\nelections, but it can’t run the back office of a bank. YouTube may be a mind-\nboggling jumble of content, but operationally it’s run by Google—the same\ncompany that delivers your search results in a nanosecond. Bureaucracy was\ninvented to maximize control, coordination, and consistency—things that are\nessential to reliability and efficiency but aren’t the hallmarks of online\ncommunities and open innovation projects.\n\nSo are we stuck? On one hand, we have all those optimistic boosters for social\ncollaboration who tell us we merely have to let the crowd have its say. That’s\nnaive. What’s typically underestimated is the complexity and indivisibility of\nmany large-scale coordination tasks. “Wisdom of the crowd” works when work can\nbe easily disaggregated and individuals can work in relative isolation. That’s\nwhy it’s been so well suited to software development. But it’s not easy to see\nhow you’d use it to run a Toyota automotive plant or Delta’s Atlanta\nmaintenance facility. Despite the buzz, the limits of crowdsourcing and open\ninnovation have relegated them to the margins of most organizations.\n\nWhat about the other hand? There you’ll find thousands of executives who can\nscarcely imagine an alternative to the organizational status quo, even if they\nbelieve that their bureaucratic organizations are gunking up the wheels of\nprogress and diminishing their ability to play against faster, more nimble\ncompetitors. Because it’s what they’ve learned and have succeeded at, they\nhold on to top-down, rule-driven structures that empower the few while\ndisempowering the many. And it’s because they’ve never seen something like\nGeneral Electric’s jet engine plant in Durham, North Carolina, where four\nhundred skilled technicians work in self-organizing teams with but a single\nplant manager to supervise them. They’ve never been inside a company like\nMorning Star, the world’s largest tomato processor, where hundreds of\ncolleagues coordinate their activities via peer-to-peer agreements, with nary\na boss in sight. Neither have they been up close with CEMEX, the Mexico-based\ncement company that uses hundreds of online, user-defined communities to build\nbrands, share best practices, and create strategy.\n\nSo no, we’re not stuck; we’re definitely not stuck. But getting\nunstuck—building and benefiting from communities at scale—requires us to start\nwith “openness” as a principle, rather than with some particular set of\ncollaborative tools or practices. Many companies have layered social\ntechnologies on top of their tradition-encrusted management practices—and most\nhave been disappointed with the results. Such superficial gestures can never\nchange an organization. To fully exploit the power of openness, we have to go\nmuch, much deeper. We have to get at the ethos of openness, and then see how\nit applies, in practice, in hiring employees, making decisions, running\noperations, allocating resources, and all of the other things that,\nsurprisingly enough, communities can do better than bureaucrats.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what Jim Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat, does in this practical\nand compelling book. Red Hat, with its seven thousand associates, is one of a\nsmall but growing number of companies that have transcended the old trade-offs\nbetween scale and agility, efficiency and innovation, and discipline and\nempowerment. In the pages that follow, Jim shows you how to operationalize the\nideas of transparency, collegiality, and meritocracy in your organization.\nMore importantly, he challenges you to rethink your most fundamental\nassumptions about how you get things done—not little, marginal things, but\nbig, complicated, mission-critical things.\n\nI have long believed that tomorrow’s most successful organizations will be\ndistinguished by a set of traits that are still remarkably uncommon. In\norganizations that are fit for the future . . .\n\n  * Leaders will be chosen by the led.\n  * Contribution will matter more than credentials.\n  * Influence will come from your value added, not your title.\n  * Individuals will compete to make a difference, not to climb a pyramid.\n  * Compensation will be set by peers, not bosses.\n  * Every idea will compete on an equal footing.\n  * Resources will be allocated with market-like mechanisms.\n  * Experimentation and fast prototyping will be core competencies.\n  * Communities of passion will be the basic organizational building blocks.\n  * Coordination will occur through collaboration, not centralization.\n  * Lateral communication will be more important than vertical communication.\n  * Structure will emerge only where it creates value and disappear everywhere else.\n  * Strategy making will be a dynamic, companywide conversation.\n  * Change will start in unexpected places and get rolled up, not out.\n  * Control will be achieved through transparency and peer feedback.\n  * Organizational boundaries will be porous.\n  * Everyone will think like a business owner, and be just as accountable.\n  * Decisions will be made as close to the coal face as possible.\n  * Commitments will be voluntary.\n  * “Why” will matter more than “what.”\n\nWhat makes Jim’s book so timely is that Red Hat already embodies many of these\npostbureaucratic traits, so there is a ton you can learn here—not only from\nRed Hat, but from the other organizations Jim draws on in building his case\nfor the “open organization.”\n\nLet me finish where I started. Today, most organizations waste more human\ncapacity than they use. How much longer do you think your organization will be\nable to afford that, given that more and more companies are embracing the\nprinciples that power Red Hat? My answer? Not as long as you think. So what\nare you waiting for? Dig in.\n\nGary Hamel  \nVisiting Professor, London Business School\n\n\n1\n\nWhy Opening Up Your Organization Matters\n\nWhenever I talk with leaders of companies in industries from manufacturing to\nretail, from software to consumer goods, I hear a consistent theme:\nfrustration that they can’t move fast enough, given the organizations they\nhave, to stay competitive. They know that capabilities like speed and agility\nare becoming the core of competitive advantage, and yet most of them struggle\nto keep their organizations moving as rapidly as all the changes in their\nenvironments. The typical chain of command is too slow to respond to\nopportunities. Central planning takes too long and consumes too many\nresources. Internal resources alone are too limited to address the challenges\nof today, let alone tomorrow.\n\nTo succeed, these leaders know they must build organizations capable of\nsuccessfully navigating the challenges of a fast-paced environment, but they\ndon’t know where to start. That’s because the classic rules of the game—which\nused to define who won or lost in business—are being swept away. Old standby\nstrategies that everyone learned in business school—like scale, scarcity, and\npositional advantage—no longer seem to apply. Continuing to do what they’ve\ndone before—and just pedaling harder—doesn’t seem to work anymore. What is the\nnew organizational model for success? And how do you build it?\n\nIf you lead or aspire to lead an organization of any kind, then you face these\nsame challenges. You can’t keep doing things the way you’ve always done them.\nYou need to tap the knowledge, creativity, ideas, energy, and power of your\nemployees. At the same time, you know that needed talent, ideas, and resources\nlie outside your company—and that your organization’s success depends on\nsuccessfully tapping into those sources of knowledge, too. That means you must\nfurther knock down the walls of your organization in ways that allow you to\ncollaborate with your customers, vendors, and partners—to open up your\norganization in a way that keeps you on the cutting edge of change.\n\nAn “open organization”—which I define as an organization that engages\nparticipative communities both inside and out—responds to opportunities more\nquickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and\ninspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act with\naccountability. The beauty of an open organization is that it is not about\npedaling harder, but about tapping into new sources of power both inside and\noutside to keep pace with all the fast-moving changes in your environment.\n\nBut how do you make this kind of organizational model work? How do you harness\nthe power of the crowd inside (your employees) as well as outside (everyone\nelse)—especially at scale?\n\nThis book reveals the secrets of how an open organization really works by\ntaking an insider’s in-depth look into one of the premier open organizations\nin the world, Red Hat (a software company with a value of more than $10\nbillion where I am the CEO), along with illustrative examples of other\ncompanies operating this way too, such as Whole Foods, Pixar, Zappos,\nStarbucks, W. L. Gore, and others. This book will show leaders and aspiring\nleaders—in companies large and small, and in established companies as well as\nstart-ups struggling to grow—how to develop a new, open organizational model\nthat uniquely matches the speed and complexity that businesses must master\ntoday.\n\nFrom Crowdsourcing to Open Sourcing\n\nMuch has been written recently about a new way of working called\n“crowdsourcing,” which is the power of mass participation to generate\nphenomenal ideas, solve complex problems, and organize broad movements. We’ve\nseen examples, such as Wikipedia or the Linux operating system (which played a\nkey role in Red Hat’s start), where communities of people spontaneously self-\norganize around a problem or activity. Work is distributed in a network-like\nfashion and people are held accountable, all without a formal hierarchy. A\ngrowing number of organizations have learned to successfully tap the “wisdom\nof the crowd” (as documented by James Surowiecki in his book of the same name)\nin order to drive innovation and gain a competitive advantage through\ncollaboration. The power of these networks has been well documented and\nexplored in books like Wikinomics and Macrowikinomics by Don Tapscott and\nAnthony D. Williams; Clay Shirky’s Here Comes Everybody; Crowdsourcing by Jeff\nHowe; and the numerous books and articles by open innovation evangelist Henry\nChesbrough.\n\nMany big-name companies, ranging from General Electric and Dell to IBM and\nStarbucks, have turned to the crowd as a way to generate new product ideas and\nturn customer feedback into the seeds of innovation. Consumer product giant\nProcter & Gamble does all that and more; it has developed a program through\nwhich it collaborates with smaller entrepreneurial companies to bring new\ngame-changing products to market. In the program’s first two years alone, it\nreportedly generated two thousand new ideas, one hundred of which were turned\ninto new product lines. Or consider [Threadless.com](http://Threadless.com), a\ncompany that uses its community of consumers and artists to make and sell\nclever T-shirts, both through its own site and more recently through a\npartnership with The Gap. There’s even a company called InnoCentive that firms\ncan hire to help them use the power of the crowd.\n\nThere are also competitions like the Ansari XPRIZE, which awarded $10 million\nto the first nongovernment organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft\ninto space twice within two weeks, or Kaggle, which crowdsources solutions to\nbig data–type analytical challenges, that get a multitude of participants to\ndeliver a bunch of ideas or solutions, where the single best of the bunch wins\nand receives an award.\n\nThe Limitations of Crowdsourcing\n\nAs effective as these “tapping the wisdom of the crowd” approaches are at\nproviding companies with new ideas and solutions to problems, they are often\nlimited in that they are either timebound, say, for the duration of a\ncompetition, or are narrowly focused on a single, specific goal, such as\ngenerating an idea for a new product. It’s a one-and-done kind of result and\nnot the basis for any kind of sustainable competitive advantage. So, while\nmany companies have tapped the power of participation in targeted ways, few\nhave leveraged its power more broadly within their own organizations. What if\nyou could make this kind of engagement standard, not just one-and-done, for\nhow work gets done in your organization, so that you’re engaging at this level\nevery single day?\n\nAnother problem with crowdsourcing is that it’s a one-way transaction.\nCrowdsourcing approaches typically depend on the contributions of\nvolunteers—people who contribute to the product primarily for the reputational\nadvantage, not necessarily for a monetary one. And, too often, it seems that\ncompanies approach these volunteers with the goal of extracting value, with\nwhat has been called a “Tom Sawyer” model of\ncollaboration.[1](index_split_019.html#filepos408950) As you might recall from\nyour childhood reading, Tom was a bit of a manipulator, someone who was always\ntrying to get out of doing chores. One time in particular, he was tasked with\nwhitewashing his Aunt Polly’s fence as a punishment. So Tom reached out to his\ncommunity and tricked his friends into doing the work for him by pretending\nthat it was a whole lot of fun to do the job. He even got them to exchange\ntrinkets for the privilege of doing the work.\n\nWhile this approach worked for Tom once, it certainly wouldn’t happen again.\nSimilarly, when today’s organizations reach out to the crowd—both inside and\noutside their walls—they’re thinking the way Tom Sawyer did by asking for help\nwithout giving much in return. This is rarely sustainable. What if there were\na way to treat both those outside your company and those within your company\ndifferently, in a way that truly inspires, motivates, and rewards top\nperformance?\n\nThe Promise of Open Source\n\nOne model that successfully harnesses the power and commitment of talent and\nengages that talent in an ongoing way over time is open source. The term “open\nsource” is traditionally used in the software arena and designates a process\nin which anyone can contribute to or access code, unlike traditional software\ndevelopment, which is proprietary and owned by the company that produces it\nand governed by intellectual property law. In open source, those who do the\nwork volunteer their time and effort, and these volunteer, participative\ncommunities are both long running and capable of tackling multiple problems\nand opportunities simultaneously.\n\nFor examples of open source communities, think about the phenomenal\ninnovations that continue to come out of Silicon Valley—far more than any one\ncompany could generate on its own—or how scientists worldwide worked together\nto unravel the human genome. The US legal system is another great example of\nthe innovative power of an open community. Can you imagine any single person\nor even team of lawyers sitting down to create a set of rules vast and\nflexible enough to encapsulate a legal system that has, in fact, grown\norganically on a case-by-case basis? It’s an extraordinarily complex system in\nwhich attorneys’ individual arguments and judges’ opinions ripple out and have\nan impact on the lives of millions of people. And it’s a system that depends\non the deep engagement of many diverse individuals playing different roles,\nbuilding on the work of each other, in this case, over centuries.\n\nOpen source communities operate on a level beyond crowdsourcing, going beyond\nthe one-way and one-time-only arrangements in which a lot of people give their\nideas or answers but don’t engage with each other over time. Instead, the way\nthey operate is better described as open sourcing, where contributors work\ntogether as a community, building on each other’s work, to arrive at the best\nsolution to a complicated problem. These communities involve many people\nworking toward a similar outcome. They usually involve a diverse community of\npeople who opt in as a way to work for a common cause about which they are\npassionate. And they produce results: they are more responsive to fast-\nchanging environments and better at accomplishing “big, hairy, audacious\ngoals” than any one single firm or\norganization.[2](index_split_019.html#filepos409559)\n\nNow imagine the impact of applying that kind of power within your own\nbusiness, where talent from a diverse range of organizations and\nbackgrounds—external volunteers from the crowd as well as your own employees\nand in-house teams—all come together to work toward something your customers\ncan benefit from. But can a single organization catalyze or influence\ndisparate groups on its own? How do you get people fired up and passionate\nabout volunteering their efforts, whether they are outside or inside the\norganization, toward something your organization will gain from?\n\nClearly, it’s not enough to just employ the strategy of “build it and they\nwill come.” They won’t. Or if they do, without a set of guidelines in place,\nyou could wind up generating more ill will than value by asking for help.\nAsking people to contribute their time and energy can be the competitive edge\nthat propels an organization forward—or an anchor that pulls it down.\n\nBut when it’s done well—wow! Imagine how innovative and responsive your\norganization would be if it could constantly generate new ideas and deliver on\nthem without any top-down interference? That’s the promise of open sourcing.\n\nTo do this, you must transition into thinking of people as members of a\ncommunity, moving from a transactional mind-set to one built on commitment.\nPerhaps more importantly, you need to apply the same principles to your\nemployees—the folks you pay—as to people who might volunteer their efforts for\nfree. Just because someone is on your payroll doesn’t ensure that you are\ngetting the best of his or her abilities. Or that another organization won’t\nlure your superstars away. You need something more to hook them in a way that\ninspires them to truly opt in and bring their passion and energy to their work\nevery day. What you need, in short, is to build a culture that truly embraces\nthe notion of being open in every sense of that word. When you can accomplish\nthat, the results are astounding.\n\nThis book explains how to lead and manage the open way.\n\nThe Open Organization\n\nOne company that not only gets the idea of open source, but was born out of\nthe open source movement, is Red Hat, the world’s leading provider of open\nsource software solutions. It’s perhaps no surprise that a company that has\nbuilt a business running and operating open source systems—where openness,\ntransparency, participation, and collaboration are the very basis for how the\ncompany makes money—espouses those same principles when managing it. Red Hat\nhas been managed using open source principles for more than twenty years.\nManaging and leading an open organization could not be more different from\nleading a more conventional one.\n\nI know because I’m the company’s president and chief executive officer. Red\nHat was an open organization long before I ever came on board in 2007. Long\nbefore I joined Red Hat, I made my mark as a quintessential top-down kind of\nleader. This company changed me and taught me how to be a better leader; this\nbook is largely about the lessons I’ve learned on why an open organization is\nso much better than a traditional one, and how to lead one.\n\nRed Hat’s Success\n\nRed Hat is recognized for reliability, profitability, and growth: its stock is\npublicly traded with a market value of more than $10 billion. One of very few\nsoftware companies with annual revenues of nearly $2 billion and certainly the\nonly open source one, it’s been lauded by publications like Forbes, Bloomberg\nBusinessweek, and others for cutting-edge innovation and for being a great\nplace to work.[3](index_split_019.html#filepos409841) It’s part of the\nStandard & Poor’s 500 and has more than seven thousand associates. You may not\nhave heard of Red Hat, but you’re likely using its technology every day. Its\nproducts power airline systems, banking networks, and underlie the majority of\nstock market equity trades. It counts more than 90 percent of the Fortune 500\nas customers, as well as influential organizations such as DreamWorks, Sprint,\nand the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIts success comes from the open organization model.\n\nA New Management Paradigm\n\nRed Hat’s open organization operates using unusual management principles that\nleverage the power of participation—both internally and externally—to generate\nconsistent financial results. It uses open sourcing to tap a massive,\ndisparate community of people, all with different skills and motivations, to\nmake super-high-performing products capable of running some of the most secure\nand mission-critical computer systems in the world. We’ve learned that to\nsuccessfully reap the rewards from open sourcing something, we have to engage\nand support the community as we work together on shared goals. We don’t just\nlook to a crowd for ideas. We innovate in, with, and through communities. By\nembracing participation from contributors within and outside the walls of the\norganization, Red Hat has created a competitive advantage that enables it to\ncompete against—and beat—far larger rivals. Red Hat operates in a really fast-\npaced environment, and the organizational structure, an open one, is the best\nway for it to keep pace with the flurry of changes it faces every single day.\nWe have harnessed the power of what economists call the “network effect” that\nresults when you connect people and ideas. The more people you connect, the\nmore value they create, which in turn attracts more people, and so on. Red\nHat’s management system encompasses principles such as:\n\n  * People join us because they want to.\n  * Contribution is critical, but it’s not a quid pro quo.\n  * The best ideas win regardless of who they come from.\n  * We encourage and expect open, frank, and passionate debate.\n  * We welcome feedback and make changes in the spirit of “release early—release often.”\n\nIn short, we’ve found that the best practices in creating open source software\nalso translate well into managing the entire company.\n\nWe have leveraged these components to create a new sort of company—an open\norganization—a rebooted, redesigned, reinvented organization suitable for the\ndecentralized, empowered digital age. By opening up the business and\nencouraging participation at every level, from both within and outside the\norganization, we’ve obtained the incredible results I’ve described.\n\nRed Hat is the only company that can say it emerged out of a pure bottom-up\nculture—namely, the open source ethos—and learned how to execute it at scale.\nIt has gone beyond the theories and developed a leadership system that works,\none that everyone from CEOs to departmental managers and aspiring leaders need\nto pay attention to because it emerged specifically to address the new rules\nof business and a socially connected and conscious workforce. Red Hat is the\nepicenter for a new management paradigm. The purpose of this book is to show\nyou how to create this kind of open, community-driven culture and how to lead\nit in a way that allows your organization to get more done, faster, and with\nmore innovative results.\n\nLeading the Open Organization\n\nBefore I arrived at Red Hat, I had spent most of my professional career\ndevoted to studying businesses. As a partner with The Boston Consulting Group\n(BCG), where I worked for ten years (with a two-year stint attending Harvard\nBusiness School), I saw the inner workings of literally hundreds of companies.\nMy job was simple: identify and solve problems. I was there to help companies\nrecognize their limitations and figure out ways to overcome them. Similarly,\nas chief operating officer at Delta Air Lines, I was chief problem solver and\ntook a lead role in Delta’s restructuring. I learned a lot over my six years\nthere, as well as during my time at BCG. I thought I knew how well-performing\norganizations should operate. I thought I knew what it took to manage people\nand get work done. But the techniques I had learned, the traditional beliefs I\nheld for management and how people are taught to run companies and lead\norganizations, were to be challenged when I entered the world of Red Hat and\nopen source.\n\nRed Hat has shown me alternatives to the traditional approach to leadership\nand management—ones better suited to the fast-paced environment of business.\nThe conventional approach to business management was not designed to foster\ninnovation, address the needs and expectations of the current workforce that\ndemands more of jobs (hello, Millennials), or operate at the accelerated speed\nof business. I came to realize, in other words, that the conventional way of\nrunning companies had major limitations that are now becoming more acute.\n\nMy change in thinking began in 2007. I had just left Delta after helping the\ncompany through a successful turnaround. A new CEO had come in and I felt it\nwas the right time for me to move on and find my next opportunity. Because\nDelta was such a high-profile company and the turnaround was considered\nsuccessful, I received dozens of calls from recruiters offering\nopportunities—especially more chances to turn around companies—at a wide\nvariety of companies, from private equity firms to Fortune 500 giants. I’ll\nadmit that, after years of hard work, it was nice to be wined and dined and\ncourted by such big names.\n\nThen I received a call from a recruiter for Red Hat. Being somewhat of a\ncomputer person myself—my undergraduate degree at Rice University was in\ncomputer science—I knew about Red Hat’s core Linux product and had been using\nthe desktop version for some time. But I didn’t know much about the company\nitself or the true extent of how pervasive open source development had become.\nAfter doing some research, I was intrigued. Part of the appeal came from the\nfact that I was wary of taking on any other turnaround opportunities after my\ntime at Delta. I had been in charge of laying off tens of thousands of people.\nAs someone who cared deeply about the people with whom I worked, I found the\nprocess extremely painful for my associates and myself. Many of the other\ncompanies courting me wanted more of the same. I just couldn’t do it. I hated\nlaying people off. Red Hat, on the other hand, offered something very\ndifferent. It was growing. It offered me a chance to help create something new\nwhile also getting back to my tech roots. I found it extraordinary how a\ncompany could make so much money selling software that, in theory, anyone\ncould download off the internet for\nfree.[4](index_split_019.html#filepos410695)\n\nAfter telling the recruiter I was interested in the interview, he asked if I\nwould mind flying to Red Hat’s headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, on a\nSunday. I thought to myself that Sunday was a strange day to schedule a\nmeeting. But I was headed up to New York on Monday anyway, so I could stop on\nthe way, and I agreed to the interview. I hopped a plane from Atlanta to the\nRaleigh-Durham airport. My cab dropped me off in front of the Red Hat\nbuilding, then on the campus of North Carolina State University. It was 9:30\na.m. on Sunday, and there was no one in sight. The lights were off, and, after\na check, I found the doors were locked. Was this a gag? I wondered. As I\nturned to get back in the cab, I noticed the driver had already pulled away.\nJust about that same time, it started raining. I had no umbrella.\n\nAs I started to walk somewhere to hail a cab, Matthew Szulik, then Red Hat’s\nchairman and CEO, rolled up in his car. “Hi there,” he said. “Want to go grab\nsome coffee?” While this seemed like a strange start to an interview, I knew I\ncould certainly use some coffee. At the very least, I figured I’d be closer to\ngetting a cab back to the airport.\n\nIn North Carolina, Sunday mornings are pretty quiet. It took us a while to\neven find a coffee shop that was open before noon. The shop wasn’t the best in\ntown or the cleanest, but it was open and had freshly brewed coffee. We\ngrabbed a booth and began to chat.\n\nAfter thirty minutes or so, I was feeling good about the way things were\ngoing. The interview wasn’t traditional, but the conversation was great.\nRather than dig into the nuts and bolts of Red Hat’s corporate strategy or its\nimage on Wall Street—things I had done homework on—Szulik asked me more about\nmy hopes, dreams, and aspirations. It seems clear to me now that Szulik was\ngauging whether I was going to be a good fit for Red Hat’s unique culture and\nmanagement style.\n\nAfter we finished, Szulik mentioned he wanted me to meet Michael Cunningham,\nthe company’s general counsel, and suggested maybe that I could have an early\nlunch with him. I agreed, so we started to get up to leave. As he grabbed for\nhis wallet, Szulik realized he didn’t have it. “Oops,” he said. “I don’t have\nany money. Do you?” This kind of caught me off guard, but I told him I had\nsome money and didn’t mind springing for the coffee.\n\nA few minutes later, Szulik dropped me off at a little Mexican eatery where I\nmet up with Cunningham. Again, this was not a traditional interview or setting\nby any means, but another great conversation. As Cunningham and I were getting\nready to settle the bill, we were informed that the restaurant’s credit card\nmachine was broken. They could only take cash. Cunningham turned to me and\nasked if I could cover it because he had no cash. Since I was on my way to New\nYork City, I had a good amount of cash so I paid for lunch.\n\nCunningham offered to give me a lift to the airport and we headed off in his\ncar. Within minutes, he asked, “Do you mind if I stop and get some gas? We’re\nrunning on fumes.” “No problem,” I replied. As soon as I heard the rhythmic\nthump of the pump begin, there was a tapping on my window. It was Cunningham.\n“Hey, they don’t take credit cards here,” he said. “Could I borrow some cash?”\nI was starting to wonder whether this was really an interview or some kind of\nscam.\n\nWhile in New York the next day, I was talking to my wife about the interview\nwith Red Hat. I told her the conversation had been great, but I wasn’t sure\nwhether they were serious about hiring me or if they just wanted some free\nfood and gas. When I look back at that meeting now, I realize that Szulik and\nCunningham were just being open and treating me like any other person they may\nhave had coffee or lunch with or got gas with. Yes, it was ironic and funny\nthat they both had no cash. But, for them, it wasn’t about the money. They,\nlike the open source world, didn’t believe in rolling out red carpets for\nanyone or trying to make sure everything was perfect. They just wanted to get\nto know me rather than try to impress or court me. They wanted to know who I\nwas.\n\nThat first interview with Red Hat showed me that working here would be\ndifferent. There wasn’t a traditional hierarchy and special treatment for\nleaders, at least not the kind that you might find at most other companies. In\ntime, I also learned that Red Hat believed in the open source principle of\nmeritocracy; that the best idea wins regardless of whether the idea comes from\nthe top executive or a summer intern. Put another way, my early experiences\nwith Red Hat introduced me to what the future of leadership looks like.\n\nHow I Learned to Lead the Open Organization\n\nYou can’t lead an open organization in the traditional top-down fashion—what I\nwas used to and, frankly, quite good at. I learned this the hard way.\n\nMy first instinct when I took the job was to recoil at what felt like chaos.\n“I need to get this company ordered and structured so that it performs\nbetter,” I thought to myself. Over time, though, I’ve come to appreciate that\nRed Hat is the product of a complex, subtle, and powerful organizing system\nthat truly frees people to be more creative, take initiative, and get more\nstuff done. Working here is inspiring and motivating, and it results in things\ngetting done quickly. As a direct result, I’ve learned to change my own style\nof leadership to fit in rather than the other way around.\n\nWhen I was at Delta, for example, I was incredibly detail oriented. I would\nreceive daily fifteen-page reports, in the smallest font you can imagine, that\nwould contain everything from yields per route to flight performance by\nairport and by fleet. In meetings I would ask why the Cincinnati–St. Louis\nroute was underperforming and call out individuals if their numbers weren’t up\nto par. I thought that leading meant making sure people were executing and\nholding them accountable for metrics. Eventually, I became known as the guy\nwith the “binders” because of all that data I carried around with me.\n\nMy job at Red Hat couldn’t be more different. Sure, I still care about\nnumbers—we are a public company after all—but I have an impact on them\nindirectly by working through our people and culture. I spend the majority of\nmy time thinking about our strategic direction and culture and talking to\ncustomers rather than worrying if things are being done precisely as I would\nchoose. A huge part of that means trusting other people to do the right\nthing—to be hands-off enough to allow the people in the organization to direct\nthemselves and make their own decisions.\n\nThat might sound a bit crazy to many, especially those who came up through\nconventionally run organizations as I did. I’ve written this book to help\nconvince you that there is, in fact, a better way to run a company—an open and\ncollaborative way. But, one thing I can personally vouch for is that shifting\nyour mind-set isn’t always easy. I thought by joining Red Hat I could change\nthe company and help it grow up. After all, why had it hired me if not to\nchange things in some way? But the truth is that Red Hat quickly changed me,\nespecially my views on how companies can and should be run. Given today’s\nrealities, Red Hat has taught me that there is a better way.\n\nI’ve also learned that the skills required to lead a company that relies\nheavily on the principles of open innovation are vastly different from those\nneeded to run a business based on the hierarchical structure of a conventional\norganization. Changing the way you might be used to leading will be painful,\nbut it will also be critical for every twenty-first century leader to\nunderstand and embrace.\n\nTop-down decision making simply doesn’t work at a company like Red Hat whose\nbusiness model depends on collaboration and shared ideas, rather than control\nof assets. A person with positional authority can try to impose this kind of\ncommand-and-control model—after all, conventional organizations have been run\nthat way for generations—but we’ve come to learn that it simply won’t work\nhere at Red Hat. Our people expect—actually, they demand—to have a voice in\nhow we run the company, ranging from the mission statement to the travel\npolicy. As CEO, I can’t simply send orders down the ranks and expect everyone\nto jump on board. In order to drive engagement and collaboration to the roots\nof an organization, you need to get people involved in the decision-making\nprocess. And you know what? It works. Red Hat is a faster, leaner, and more\ninnovative company as a result.\n\nAt Delta, for example, I led a massive organization of men and women who grew\nup in a world of hierarchy and who reliably followed the chain of command. So\nI was surprised to realize that at Red Hat, I had to build credibility and\ninfluence with the whole team before I could truly make an impact. Early on, I\nissued what I thought was an order to create a research report. A few days\nlater, I asked the people assigned to the task how things were going. “Oh, we\ndecided it was a bad idea, so we scrapped it,” they told me in good cheer.\n\nThat’s a difficult concept for many of my peers in other companies to embrace.\nOther CEOs to whom I’ve told this story have gasped, “What do you mean they\ndidn’t do what you asked them to? That’s insubordination! You should have\nfired them.” At first, I felt that way, too. But, the truth is that my team\nwas right to turn down the job—it either wasn’t a great idea or, just as\nimportantly, I hadn’t done a good enough job selling them on why they should\njump into it. A leader’s effectiveness is no longer measured by his or her\nability to simply issue orders.\n\nPeople need a thick skin to deal with the extensive and often relentless\nfeedback involved in working the way we do at Red Hat. It takes time, effort,\nand a good dose of humility—especially if you’re the CEO—in order to build\nsuch a culture. (If you don’t openly allow and encourage your employees to\ntell you you’re wrong, you’ll never build an organization that can innovate\nbetter than your competitors.) That means, of course, that we operate on the\nbleeding edge, as we continue to move forward, making plenty of mistakes and\nlearning from them as we go.\n\nMy job is not about conjuring up brilliant strategies and making people work\nharder. What I need to do is create the context for Red Hat associates so they\ncan do their best work. My goal is to get people to believe in the mission and\nthen create the right structures that empower them to achieve what once might\nhave been impossible.\n\nIt’s a bit like living in the Old West. We have the opportunity to do\nsomething new. While that’s exciting, it’s also unsettling to think that\neverything you learned in business school or in running a conventional\norganization may be outdated or obsolete. Managing this kind of structure\nintroduces a great deal of complexity and often makes decision making far\nharder. But the end result is nothing short of magic, something that Red Hat’s\nshareholders, who have seen a quadrupling in the value of their stock over the\npast four years, can attest to.\n\nWhat You Will Get from This Book\n\nAs word has leaked out about Red Hat’s success and the collaborative nature of\nits culture, bellwether organizations like GE have asked, “How do you create\nsuch magic?” This book is the answer to that question. The principles,\ninsights, and tips throughout will help you turn your organization into a more\nopen one and will help you transform your own leadership style, as I’ve\ntransformed mine. But the lessons don’t apply to just big companies. For too\nlong, entrepreneurs have been told that eventually their organizations need to\nmature by embracing the conventional hierarchical systems that big companies\nuse. The open organization offers an alternative to that kind of stale\nthinking. Small companies have much to gain by keeping the same participatory\ndynamics on which they now thrive to grow into the future.\n\nOrganizations of all shapes and sizes and in all kinds of industries can\nbenefit from the open organization model in this book. Though I feature my own\nlessons as CEO of Red Hat and the voices of other Red Hat associates\nthroughout, I’ll also describe how companies such as Whole Foods, Pixar,\nZappos, Starbucks, W. L. Gore, and others are applying and succeeding with\nthese ideas, too.\n\nYour New Playbook for Leading and Managing\n\nIn the following pages, I’ll show you how to rewrite the rules for getting\nwork done by tapping the power of the crowd inside and outside your\norganization’s walls.\n\nI will describe how an open organization management system—visually depicted\nin figure 1-1—functions differently from conventional management thinking in\ncore areas like motivating and inspiring people, getting things done day-to-\nday, and setting direction. The book is organized into six key areas in three\nsections—the why, the how, and the what—and describes how we as a team run the\ncompany based on the best practices we’ve culled from building open source\nsoftware. Some of these concepts will be familiar to readers; others will open\nup new areas of discussion. But the key point is that all these components\ncomplement each other and function together as a cutting-edge management\nsystem that is the foundation for building participative communities. This is\na blueprint for the kind of environment you as a leader need to create in\norder to get people to opt in to your community.\n\nFIGURE 1-1\n\nThe conventional organization versus the open organization\n\n![](images/00004.jpg)\n\nI’ll focus on best practices, such as how to stoke employees’ passion\n([chapter 2](index_split_009.html#filepos64768)), how to engage the workforce\n([chapter 3](index_split_010.html#filepos124058)), and why everyone in an open\norganization like Red Hat, including the CEO, has to earn a level of influence\nthrough merit ([chapter 4](index_split_012.html#filepos184468)). I’ll also\ntalk about how opening yourself up means that you need to find ways to\nencourage collaboration ([chapter 5](index_split_013.html#filepos231124)) and\nhow decision making is a lengthy process, but once it is done, execution\nbecomes much more effective ([chapter 6](index_split_015.html#filepos279794)).\nI’ll wrap up by talking about the changing nature of leadership within a\ncommunity ([chapter 7](index_split_016.html#filepos334418)) before discussing\nin the epilogue what the future of open source organizations looks like and\nwhat might be possible because of them. Throughout, I’ll offer you some hands-\non tips for adopting these best practices in your own organization, no matter\nhow open it currently is.\n\nWhat follows isn’t management theory. Rather, it is an empirical observation\nabout how Red Hat and other companies on the cutting edge of management\noperate and lead. I’ll share the lessons we continue to learn so that you,\ntoo, can thrive in an economy where all the old rules about how to lead the\norganizations of the future are changing. I’ll also share stories about other\ncompanies and organizations, so you can also learn valuable lessons when\nthinking about building a passionate and engaged workforce. Over time, I hope\nthese and other practices are ultimately codified into a new management\nparadigm. But I’ll leave that to the academics. Perhaps these lessons can\nbecome a part of what business schools teach in the years to come.\n\nI turn first to where it all starts—with igniting passion.\n\n\nPART ONE\n\nWHY\n\nMotivating and Inspiring\n\n\n2\n\nIgniting Passion\n\nWhen Red Hat first approached me about taking the job as president and CEO,\nthe recruiter leading the search tried to describe the company’s culture. He\nwaxed on about the company’s vision and its motivated workforce. Then he\npaused and said, “Do you remember the scene in Blues Brothers where Dan\nAykroyd says, ‘We’re on a mission from God?’ Red Hat kind of feels like that.\nThese folks really believe they’re on a mission to change the world.” I nodded\nmy head, figuring I knew what he meant. After all, I had been helping lead\nDelta Air Lines through its bankruptcy, which was one of the most difficult\nthings I had ever done. I assumed that in that process, in which the entire\nworkforce banded together to turn the airline around, I had experienced\nfirsthand how having a purpose and passion can become a powerful force for\nchange.\n\nFor generations, Delta has been an institution in the South—especially in the\nAtlanta area where it is now based. Everyone, including me, has always had a\nsense of pride working for the company. Even my mom was proud of me for\nworking at Delta. Generations of families have worked there. That’s why, when\nthe company faced financial problems in the wake of 9/11 and spiking oil\nprices, we all embraced a shared purpose that we weren’t going to let the\ncompany fail on our generation’s watch. We spent a lot of time driving home to\neveryone in the organization that we were in this together and that the\nsacrifices we were making through cuts to benefits and salaries were a\nnecessary part of reaching our shared goal. The powerful purpose helped drive\na deeper commitment to what we were working on as we fought through the\nbankruptcy.\n\nBut it wasn’t until a rival airline swooped in with the intent to buy Delta\nafter we had made all of those sacrifices to turn the company around that I\nsaw something different in the eyes of my peers and coworkers. It was passion,\npure and simple. Somehow the threat of being taken over by a rival lit a fire\nthroughout the workforce. Employees, all on their own, began making and\nwearing T-shirts and buttons emblazoned with the slogan, “Keep Delta, My\nDelta.” They were standing up and saying no. After all that we had been\nthrough, we weren’t going to give up now. It was as if a match had been lit\nand the entire company rallied together to meet the shared threat of a\ntakeover.\n\nThe remarkable thing was, it worked: in the face of the passion we all showed,\nthe rival stopped pursuing the acquisition. The CEO of the other company\ncredited Delta employees’ massive outpouring of support as one of the main\nreasons he walked away from the deal. He said he was worried about the\npotential backlash to his own airline if he completed the deal. That moment\nconcluded what was, for many of us, a deeply emotional experience and showed\nme the power of passion ignited in a workforce—a key lesson I brought with me\nwhen I joined Red Hat.\n\nIt Starts with a Purpose\n\nOver the past few years, many authors have written about “intrinsic\nmotivation”—things inside a person that motivate him or her, as opposed to\nexternal incentives like money or power. In their best-selling book, Conscious\nCapitalism, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey and Babson College professor Raj\nSisodia write:\n\n> > Business has a much broader positive impact on the world when it is based\n> on a higher purpose that goes beyond only generating profits and creating\n> shareholder value. Purpose is the reason a company exists. A compelling\n> sense of higher purpose creates an extraordinary degree of engagement among\n> all stakeholders and catalyzes creativity, innovation, and organizational\n> commitment . . . Higher purpose and shared core values unify the enterprise\n> and elevate it to higher degrees of motivation, performance, and ethical\n> commitment at the same time.[1](index_split_019.html#filepos410967)\n\nOr, as the authors of the excellent book Collective Genius so aptly put it:\n“Purpose is often misunderstood. It’s not what a group does but why it does\nwhat it does. It’s not a goal but a reason—the reason it exists, the need it\nfulfills, and the assistance it bestows. It is the answer to the question\nevery group should ask itself: if we disappeared today, how would the world be\ndifferent tomorrow?”[2](index_split_019.html#filepos411274)\n\nThat’s a message more and more companies are giving weight to. Having a\npurpose is not something just for tech companies or newfangled start-ups. For\ninstance, the J.M. Smucker Company in Orrville, Ohio, which makes and markets\neverything from jams and jellies to coffee and peanut butter, has a stated\npurpose of “Bringing Families Together to Share Memorable Meals and\nMoments.”[3](index_split_019.html#filepos411606) Or, consider the following\ndiverse list of organizations and their stated purpose:\n\n> > Disney—“To use our imagination to bring happiness to millions.”\n\n> > Johnson & Johnson—“To alleviate pain and suffering.”\n\n> > Southwest Airlines—“To give people the freedom to fly.”\n\n> > Pivot Leadership—“Better Leaders = Better World.”\n\n> > Charles Schwab—“A relentless ally for the individual investor.”\n\n> > BMW—“To enable people to experience the joy of driving.”\n\n> > Humane Society—“Celebrating animals, confronting cruelty.”\n\n> > American Red Cross—“Enabling Americans to perform extraordinary acts in\n> the face of emergencies.”[4](index_split_019.html#filepos411958)\n\nMackey and Sisodia also write:\n\n> > People are most fulfilled and happiest when their work is aligned with\n> their own inner passions. Personal passion, corporate purpose, and business\n> performance all go together. For a passionate foodie, working for Wegmans or\n> Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods Market can be truly fulfilling. For outdoors\n> enthusiasts, Patagonia, REI, and L.L.Bean are wonderful places to work. In\n> such settings, work becomes so much more than a job. It even goes beyond\n> having a satisfying career. It becomes a calling—something we were born to\n> do.[5](index_split_019.html#filepos412200)\n\nFor Mackey and Whole Foods, their purpose is nothing less than to change the\nkind of food and beverages each of us consumes so that we become healthier and\nlive fuller lives as a result.\n\nIn Red Hat’s case, its purpose and calling—To be the catalyst in communities\nof customers, contributors, and partners creating better technology the open\nsource way—is built upon open source software (more on that later). But\nadditional examples of how the dynamics of passion and purpose are changing\nthe way work gets done come from other people and companies, as with Mackey\nand Whole Foods. Do you think a grocery chain could become as successful if\nthe people who work and shop there didn’t believe in the purpose of growing\nand eating healthy, ethically sourced food?\n\nThe same can be said of the open source community. Participants in open source\ndecided they wanted a hand in the technology being created—that was their\npurpose for investing their time in creating better software. They didn’t want\nto trust all of the work to the engineers sitting behind the walls of\nproprietary software companies.\n\nFor example, I send out personal e-mails to any Red Hatter who is celebrating\na longtime anniversary—ten-year, fifteen-year, and so on—working with us. When\nI sent one to one of our top engineers, Mark McLoughlin, to celebrate his ten-\nyear anniversary, he replied:\n\n> > I think what’s most gratifying is that after 10 years and the tremendous\n> growth we’ve had, I’m still here for the same reason I joined in the first\n> place—that Red Hat is a pure-play open source company.\n\n> > Thanks again!\n\n> > Mark.\n\nMaking the code free and open was why top engineers like McLoughlin decided to\nwork with us; they saw a job at Red Hat as a way to do good for the world.\nIt’s how Red Hat is able to attract the most talented people and engage them\nto the best of their abilities; we have a mission they believe in. Some\ncompanies dabble in offering some open source products, but Red Hat people are\nabsolutely passionate about the fact that the only products we sell are 100\npercent open source, which is something we all believe is fundamentally good\nfor the world.\n\nFor context, software has long been a domain in which companies have tried to\n“control the code” and then charge customers to use that code. But Red Hatters\nare products of the “maker movement”: people who embrace the decentralization\nof production. We see massive benefits to making the code free for everyone to\nuse and benefit from. That helps explain why politicians and statesmen like\nthe presidents of Brazil, Poland, and India attend Red Hat events. They see\nopen source software like Linux as good public policy because they aren’t\nforced to pay companies for the intellectual property associated with the\ncode. That’s why Linux programmers say, “Open source is not a matter of life\nor death; it’s much more important than that.”\n\nBut whether your business is to provide wholesome food or to write software\nthat runs nuclear submarines, if you can create a compelling reason for people\nto participate, they will. The ultimate benefits of having a purpose, then,\nare that people work harder and turnover is lower than the industry average.\nAs the authors of Collective Genius put it: “Purpose—not the leader, authority\nor power—is what creates and animates a community. It is what makes people\nwilling to do the hard tasks of innovation together and work through the\ninevitable conflict and tension.”[6](index_split_019.html#filepos412361)\n\nMore and more, executives and entrepreneurs are beginning to understand the\nimportance of having a purpose in business—you need to have a goal in mind\nthat transcends the profit motive. That’s the only way you’ll be able to\nattract the best and brightest talent. Think about the success that Tony Hsieh\nand his company, Zappos, have had, for example, by focusing on delivering\nhappiness to their customers.\n\nBut what’s less clear is that to truly perform at a peak level, simply\ndefining a purpose is not enough. It’s just a first step, the table stakes for\ncompeting in the twenty-first-century economy. What sets open organizations\napart, and what gives them a true competitive advantage, is that they also\nhave embraced the idea that they need to activate the emotional passions and\ndesires among their workers to actually reach that ultimate destination as\ndefined by their purpose. Today’s workers want their work to mean something;\nthey want to be part of something that makes a difference. If having a purpose\ngets people to do the right things, then passion motivates them to\nextraordinary performance—to go the extra mile—as they try to fulfill their\ngoal.\n\nPurpose is a baseline. But when you add passion, it’s like pouring gasoline on\nthe fire. That’s what can take your organization to the next level of\nperformance and achievement. As management expert Gary Hamel says, “To put it\nbluntly, the most important task for any manager today is to create a work\nenvironment that inspires exceptional contribution and that merits an\noutpouring of passion, imagination and\ninitiative.”[7](index_split_019.html#filepos412522)\n\nAt Red Hat, we realize that people invest their valuable time by choosing to\nwork with us (versus the myriad other alternatives they have) because they\nwant to feel as if they are changing the world for the better. Unlike my\nexperience at Delta during the takeover attempt, Red Hat maintains an\nextremely high level of passion every day. It’s not episodic or periodic: it’s\nconsistently there, bubbling, simmering, and sometimes exploding.\n\nAt Zappos, the idea of delivering happiness to its customers begins by\nfocusing on first building a team that believes in the company’s purpose. As\nMig Pascual, a content developer for Zappos Insights, part of the Zappos\nFamily of Companies, puts it, “Zappos hires talent whose personal values align\nwith the company’s core values, our employees have a genuine interest in\nhelping others. They’re inspired to be a part of something bigger than they\nare, and are able to fulfill their personal higher purpose at work by living\nout their own values every day.”[8](index_split_019.html#filepos412799)\n\nRed Hat associates passionately live our purpose every day, so it becomes the\nnorm. I sometimes forget how different and special it is until someone new\nsees it. At a conference for Red Hat’s European partners, the chief\ninformation officer (CIO) of a large industrial giant gave a keynote speech.\nDuring a dinner at the conference, the CIO leaned over to me and said, almost\nin amazement, “I have never seen a company of this size where the people are\nso passionate. Look at how much energy they have and how much they care, and\nthis is just an internal event. You need to figure out how to bottle this!”\nThat was not just gratifying to hear, but also eye opening because it helped\nframe for me how passion can be contagious and how it infects others around\nyou so that they want to work and collaborate with you. That’s why open\norganization leaders should look for ways to spur passion not just in response\nto threats, but also in repeatable and sustainable ways that create a\ncompetitive advantage for their organizations.\n\nRethinking the Role of Emotion in the Workplace\n\nWe often use the word “emotional” as if it’s a bad word, especially in the\nworkplace. You could argue that much of what we’re taught about conventional\nmanagement theory and practice is all about making the business world as\ndispassionate as possible. When people cry at their desks or explode in\nlaughter in a meeting, they’re often immediately written off as being\n“unprofessional.” Why? Because emotions aren’t clear-cut, they make things\nseem messy. Think back to the birth of social sciences like microeconomics,\nwhen economists used supply-and-demand curves to map out how people and\nmarkets operate. In science, we often make simplifying assumptions. In\nmanagement science, the simplifying assumption is that people are rational,\nvalue-maximizing, unemotional cogs.\n\nThink back to the Economics 101 class you might have taken in school. Your\nprofessor might have explained how certain simplifying assumptions are made to\nmake the math work—assumptions that people are rational and that everyone has\naccess to the same information. But toward the end of the semester, after you\nthought you understood what was going on, your professor confessed that the\nmarkets aren’t really ever in equilibrium, there is no perfect information,\nand people are clearly not always rational. How else could bubbles and busts\noccur?\n\nConventional management theory makes similar (but inconsistent) simplifying\nassumptions because they are both social sciences that developed at a similar\ntime in history. Management theorists had to make certain simplifying\nassumptions in which they stripped any kind of emotion or irrationality from\nthe equation in order to make their models work. They needed people to act\nlike cogs in a wheel, simply as inputs to a system that would create outputs.\nBut, as we know, people don’t easily fit such models, mostly because we don’t\nact in the rational ways economists or management theorists think we should. A\nwhole field of study, behavioral economics, has emerged to tackle this issue\nin the field of economics. We need the same in business.\n\nInspiration, enthusiasm, motivation, excitement—those are emotions, too.\nAren’t they generally considered to be positive things? Don’t you want your\nworkers to be inspired and engaged in what they’re doing? The question\nbecomes, then, do you really want employees to check their emotions at the\ndoor? The short answer is no. As a leader, you should be working very\nintentionally to spark as much emotion and passion as you can among your team\nrather than worrying about running the kinds of conventional management\nstudies that try to measure how hard or fast people are working. While that\nform of management style may have worked well when workers tackled rote tasks\nlike turning screwdrivers and working on assembly lines, it’s completely\nirrelevant to modern workers. Today, we can use robots to complete mundane\ntasks. What sets the best companies apart from their competition is their\nability to attract the kinds of innovative, intelligent, and, yes, emotional\nworkers, who want to do far more than just show up and punch a clock. What\nopen organization leaders need to do, then, is to challenge their people to\ntake initiative, find ways to innovate, and gain an edge on the competition by\ngetting them to all work together in pursuing a common goal.\n\nTapping into passion is especially important in building the kinds of\nparticipative communities that drive open organizations. The open source\ncommunities like Linux in which we at Red Hat work rarely emerge when there is\nno passion for the community’s purpose. For Red Hat, that sense of purpose is\ndriven by our passion to change the world by wholeheartedly embracing the\nprinciples of open source development.\n\nThe Leader’s Role: Leading a Passionate Organization\n\nThe challenge for leaders is that—unlike financial planning, capital\nbudgeting, or organization structure—there really is no formal management\ntheory created to build, leverage, and measure passion among workers and other\nmembers of the participative community. Maybe the closest measurement is the\nlevel of engagement or even morale among workers, which companies typically\ngauge through employee surveys. While you can learn quite a lot from these\nmeasures—and we do use them at Red Hat—they can’t easily capture exactly what\nI’m talking about. Unfortunately, it essentially falls into that ambiguous\ncategory of “You’ll know it when you see it.”\n\nWhen I first got to Red Hat, it took me some time to adjust to and even make\nsense of the level of passion. I vividly recall, for example, conducting my\nfirst company meeting where I stood up in front of a group of Red Hat\nassociates to answer their questions. But rather than pepper me with questions\nabout the company’s marketing strategy or the potential of the stock price,\nthey asked things like, “What kind of operating system do you run your\ncomputers at home on?” “Have you ever used Linux or Fedora before?” “Do you\nhave your RHCE?” (RHCE is a Red Hat Certified Engineer.) What these folks were\ntrying to assess was not whether I had a handle on Red Hat’s business model.\nThey wanted to see how committed I was to the cause. Their hard-driving\nquestions were designed to see if I was as passionate about it as they were,\nbecause they wanted to know if I would fit into the culture they had all built\ntogether.\n\nAfter my first day of interviews at Red Hat, my wife knew something was\ndifferent about me. She told me it was the first time my face actually lit up\nwhen I talked about my experience. I came to realize that I was excited about\nthe potential of going to work for a disruptive company, one that was creating\npositive change in the world. That was something that, while I didn’t know the\nnitty-gritty details about the technology yet, I could truly get passionate\nabout.\n\nA powerful awakening for me, I realized how motivating it is when a company\ntruly has a positive mission and a purpose behind it. If you watch football on\nSundays as I do, you’ll notice commercials in which big-name companies talk\nabout all the good they are doing in the world—regardless of what their\nbusiness models might actually involve. As a result, the message falls flat;\nit feels false. As the old adage says, you can’t put lipstick on a pig. That’s\nespecially true in our social media era, where it’s just about impossible to\nfake authenticity. But when your organization really does have the kind of\npurpose that fuels a true sense of passion among your workers, it’s\nelectrifying—and that’s something people even outside your company’s walls\ncan’t help but notice.\n\nAs Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic, said: “Authenticity is not a\ncharacteristic; it is who you are. It means knowing who you are and what your\npurpose is. Your True North is what you believe at the deepest level, what\ntruly defines you—your beliefs, your values, your passions, and the principles\nyou live by.”[9](index_split_019.html#filepos413129) That the company\nconsistently makes the various “best companies to work at” lists is no\nsurprise: it earns positive reviews from its employees for everything from its\n“small business atmosphere” to its exceptional work-life balance and delivers\nexception financial performance as\nwell.[10](index_split_019.html#filepos413316)\n\nSimilar to Delta, our company has had moments when Red Hatters’ passion\nexploded in the wake of threats from competitors and rivals. One great example\npredates me. Red Hat was blindsided by a longtime strategic partner that\nrepositioned itself as a formidable competitor. At that competitor’s annual\nindustry event in San Francisco, where Red Hat had a booth and a sizable\npresence, the industry giant announced that it would begin offering a new\nLinux distribution, which was essentially the source code for Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux, stripped of trademarks and rebranded as its own\n“unbreakable” Linux product and sold at half the price.\n\nThat kind of news wasn’t welcome on Wall Street, where Red Hat’s stock took an\nimmediate hit. Rumors even began to fly that its rival was about to acquire\nRed Hat as a way to take control of Linux as a whole. Overall, the situation\nlooked grim. As Leigh Day, now vice president of corporate marketing and a\nlongtime Red Hatter, remembers: “The whole company was just stunned, and there\nwas a palpable sense of fear. Everyone was posting on memo-list [one of the\ninternal e-mail lists], lots of speculation about what this meant for us as a\ncompany, and the question that kept coming up was, how was Red Hat going to\nrespond?”\n\nThat’s when a Red Hat engineer, Rik van Riel, jokingly posted that the company\nshould trademark the term “Unfakeable Linux.” In the conference rooms where\nthe marketing and public relations folks were huddled, debating various\nresponses, it was as if a light bulb went on. “It was so typically Red Hat,”\nDay told me. “In came this great idea, the perfect response, from this\npassionate young engineer up in Westford, [Massachusetts], and we just ran\nwith it.”\n\nKnowing that so many Red Hatters were on site at the event booth in San\nFrancisco, a group from across different departments worked late into the\nnight from the Raleigh headquarters to pull together a coordinated response.\nThe next morning, visitors to our company’s website saw “Unfakeable Linux”\nprominently featured on the home page. There were FAQs for the media and\ncustomers. At the competitor’s event, Red Hatters proudly manned their booth,\nwearing red “Unfakeable Linux” T-shirts, ready to answer questions from\ncustomers and partners. Back in Raleigh, the design team had called T-shirt\nshops all over California until they found one open late that agreed to print\nand deliver the T-shirts to the events manager in a nearby parking lot that\nmorning.\n\n“It is one of my favorite Red Hat memories, because we had all felt so crushed\nby the announcement,” Day told me. “We then pulled together, galvanized by\nthis attack on our company and the open source way, and responded in an\nincredibly cheeky, coordinated, bold way that our competitor never could.\nEveryone, from our engineers to our designers to our sales people, were so\nproud to be Red Hatters at that moment.”\n\nWhat’s remarkable is that this wasn’t an isolated moment in Red Hat history.\nEvery day, the passion of the people who work at Red Hat bubbles up to the\nsurface. Take, for example, Jon Masters, a technology architect, who once gave\na keynote speech at the industrywide Red Hat Summit while riding a bike that\nwas powering the computer server he was using to give his presentation.\n“Working at Red Hat is one of the most rewarding and challenging jobs I have\never had or seen any of my friends have,” Masters has said. “The unstructured\nenvironment is daunting at first, but over time it becomes exhilarating to\nhave that kind of dynamic environment. The thing that really excites me is\nthat there are always new challenges and opportunities.” The passion is\ncontagious. It’s impossible to be around people like Masters and not be\ninfected by the passion that pervades this place.\n\nMake It Personal\n\nDescribing the value of a passionate organization is one thing; trying to\nbuild and maintain one is another set of lessons entirely. That’s why a key\npart of my job is to help stoke that level of passion through my own actions.\nThat means that when a new version of Fedora—a free community distribution of\nLinux—comes out, I try to be one of the first to download it and comment on\nits new features on our message boards. Sometimes my job means embracing the\nfun-loving and irreverent side of the business—like dressing up for our\ncompanywide Halloween party. A leader of a twenty-first-century organization\nis, in part, a “cheerleader-in-chief.” Passion is an emotion, and it’s tough\nto convey emotion in an e-mail or a company newsletter. Passion is, almost by\nits very nature, personal.\n\nW. L. Gore & Associates, which has brought us breakthrough products like Gore-\nTex, also credits breaking down the traditional corporate walls for helping\nthe company continue to grow (it now has more than nine thousand associates in\nmore than thirty countries and annual sales of more than $3 billion), more\nthan fifty years after its founding. One of the company’s associates once\nsaid, “The things we accomplish in business are very personal for a lot of us.\nIt’s not just that I’ve accomplished a business goal with a team, and then I\ncan just go home and shut my brain off and go about life as usual. A lot of\nthe other folks we work with become our friends and our family in a lot of\nways, and when something good happens, we’re going to celebrate the fact that\nwe accomplished something. Sometimes, it’s not just the destination; it’s the\njourney.”[11](index_split_019.html#filepos413595)\n\nWhile all of this might seem somewhat silly to seasoned executives, it’s all\nabout breaking down barriers and showing everyone that we want them to let\ndown their guard and let their passion rip. If purpose is about innate desire,\nthen passion is adrenaline—the rocket fuel that propels people to walk through\nwalls to make the place successful.\n\nWhile I had tinkered with Linux before taking the job at Red Hat, I didn’t\nhave the deep appreciation for the power of open source that the people there\nalready had, some of whom had laid the groundwork for the company’s growth at\nthe very beginning when it was essentially a bunch of developers working\ntogether. But what I could demonstrate was that I cared about what we could\naccomplish through open source, and that’s something every Red Hatter takes to\nheart.\n\nMost companies have a stated corporate purpose or mission statement.\nUnfortunately, these are rarely used words that do little to drive purpose or\npassion within the company. This is often because leaders do not feel that\ndriving a connection to the corporate mission is part of their daily job. In\nopen organizations, the connection is critical and can create substantially\nbetter performance in any company. A key job of every leader is to\ncontinuously create the context required for passion to emerge by connecting\nassociates’ job functions to the organization’s broader mission. The good news\nis that it doesn’t require a companywide mandate to get started. Any leader,\nin any company and in any function, has the opportunity to drive that\nconnection. Connecting to the mission and showing personal passion can take\nany organization to a new level of performance.\n\nHire Passionate People\n\nThe level of passion in your organization is obviously correlated with how\ndeeply your people connect with its purpose. As Simon Sinek, author of Start\nwith Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action, stated in a TED\nTalk he gave in 2009, there has to be a reason, a purpose, for today’s workers\nto commit and give their best effort for an organization. He continued:\n\n> > Great companies don’t hire skilled people and motivate them, they hire\n> already motivated people and inspire them. People are either motivated or\n> they are not. Unless you give motivated people something to believe in,\n> something bigger than their job to work toward, they will motivate\n> themselves to find a new job and you’ll be stuck with whoever is left. If\n> you hire people just because they can do a job, they’ll work for your money.\n> But if you hire people who believe what you believe, they’ll work for you\n> with blood and sweat and tears.[12](index_split_019.html#filepos413810)\n\nFor example, at Red Hat, we have at least three associates who are so\npassionate about the company’s role in changing the world through open source\ntechnology that they have gotten tattoos of Shadowman, the elusive icon\nwearing the red fedora in our company logo. (Here’s a bit of trivia: the red\nhat is an homage to our cofounder, Marc Ewing, who was known as “the guy in\nthe red hat” during his time at Carnegie Mellon University, where he often\nwore his grandfather’s red lacrosse cap. It’s also a nod to several historical\nrevolutionaries who wore red hats during uprisings.) How many companies can\nsay the same? That’s a level of permanence and sense of mission that no\neconomist could ever have predicted with a chart. One owner of a tattoo,\nThomas Cameron, a chief architect based in Austin, Texas, told me, “Regardless\nof what happens to Red Hat, whether it gets bought or even if I leave someday,\nit doesn’t change my history. Yes, I have ink and it’s because I am proud and\nhumbled to be part of all this. I have come to realize how life-changing and\nbeneficial to society this software we work on is. The mind-set and technology\nbehind it is a way of life. There is a spiritual aspect to it. I hope and\nbelieve that the work and collaboration I have done has had an impact. I\nconsider myself the luckiest guy because I get paid to make the world a better\nplace.”\n\nAnother powerful example is Adam Miller, who also has a Shadowman tattoo,\nwhich he got to mark his ten-year anniversary as part of the greater Red Hat\nopen source community. Only Miller didn’t work for Red Hat at the time! He\nactually worked for a big computer company with a household name. As you might\nimagine, his coworkers had a hard time understanding why he would do something\nas radical as getting a tattoo of another company’s logo. “Red Hat, Linux, and\nopen source in general really changed the course of my life in so many ways.\nIt’s something I’ve been passionate about for a long time,” says Miller, who\nwisely got his wife’s approval before he made his final decision.\n\nWhile it would be wonderful if everyone in your organization and every new\nhire brought that same level of motivation and passion with them into work\nevery day, that’s not always possible. So how does an organization like Red\nHat find people who believe in the same mission as it does?\n\nFirst off, we have observed that the conventional interview process does a\nmediocre job of identifying if someone is truly a fit with our culture. While\nwe can ask lots of questions to determine someone’s skills and experience, it\ncan be difficult to assess if they are truly passionate about the organization\nand our mission or just excited about the prospect of landing a job, any job.\nCulture fit is a hard thing to tease out in an interview. When it’s core to\nyour company, you must find ways to ensure that you’re hiring the right\npeople. When W. L. Gore makes its hiring decisions, for example, it looks for\ncandidates who are driven, but not just by their desire to climb the corporate\nladder. To help assess that kind of cultural fit, Gore relies on teams of its\nassociates during its hiring process.[13](index_split_019.html#filepos414304)\n\nRed Hat also finds passionate people by relying on Red Hatters themselves. The\nRed Hat Ambassadors program—an associate referral initiative—was started\nbecause we recognized that good people know other good people in terms of both\ntheir skills and their potential fit for an organization’s culture. As the\ntagline for the program says, “No one can spot a potential Red Hatter better\nthan a current Red Hatter.” While Red Hat always had an informal referral\nprogram, it wasn’t until we formalized the process by creating the Ambassadors\nprogram two years ago that we began to see internal referrals skyrocket from\nabout 29 percent of all new hires to more than half.\n\nOnce again, the details of the plan did not come down from on high; a cross-\nfunctional advisory board assembled to lead the program’s implementation. That\nhelps explain why we went beyond the typical corporate approach of simply\nhanding out cash rewards. What we have in place now is a structured program,\nsimilar to a tiered airline program in which you can achieve a different\nstatus based on how much you fly. In our case, we wanted to create an\naspirational incentive plan that would reward associates for how many\nreferrals they made that led to new hires. We asked associates what kind of\nrewards they wanted.\n\nAt the first level, a Red Hatter becomes a “Super Ambassador,” earning a\nT-shirt and sticker for his or her first successful referral. It takes three\nsuccessful referrals to reach the second level, where associates earn an extra\n25 percent cash referral bonus, a sticker, and a coveted hoodie emblazoned\nwith the words, “Mega Ambassador.” Refer five people, and they attain\n“Ultimate Ambassador” status, which includes a onetime, 100 percent bonus\nmatch (effectively doubling the referral bonus), and the choice of either a\ncape or a jacket conveying that they are a Red Hat Ultimate Ambassador. In an\nannual drawing among Ultimate Ambassadors, they can earn prizes like a new\nbicycle; perhaps just as importantly, they are invited to join the program’s\nadvisory board. As a whole, the program has been a tremendous success in terms\nof both getting talent inside the company and feeding the collaborative energy\nwe continue to stoke.\n\nWe haven’t been able to completely eliminate interviewing people. But when I\nassess a candidate, I have changed the kinds of questions I ask. If you stick\nto only asking traditional questions during an interview—“Tell me about a\nsituation where you failed?” or “Tell me about a situation where you were\nparticularly collaborative?”—most people have scripted answers.\n\nInstead, I focus more on asking about candidates’ views on where their\nprevious company is going and what they see as its future. How is the company\npositioned? I want to know if they have enough innate curiosity and analytical\nand conceptual skills to be able to frame strategically where they stand. A\nlot is about discovering if they are curious enough to care and want to know.\nI don’t want somebody working for me who doesn’t care. To me, curiosity also\nsignals that the person isn’t in it just for him- or herself.\n\nBy asking more macro-level questions, I can see where a candidate perceives\nthe company as a whole moving, beyond just his or her individual role in that\nshift. If you’re really trying to understand the whole business and clearly\nhave opinions about it, that says you’re not spending 100 percent of your time\njust making sure you nail your own job. It means you’ve clearly built\nrelationships and talk to other people within the company. When someone brings\nthat kind of perspective to an interview, that’s a telltale sign that he or\nshe has the potential to be a great team player.\n\nLike connecting with a company’s mission, this does not require a top-down\ncorporate mandate. Almost all leaders have an opportunity to shape who is on\ntheir team—either by hiring or deciding who can transfer in or out.\nRecognizing that passion is a key criterion for a high-performing team and\nscreening for that in your personnel decisions can bring tremendous value to\nyour own team.\n\nRecognize and Reinforce Passion\n\nAnother key aspect of building a passionate organization is finding ways to\nreinforce the kinds of behaviors you want to seed throughout the entire\nculture. One way that happens at Red Hat is through active internal message\nlists and e-mails, where the community goes out of its way to celebrate people\ndoing great things.\n\nAn example of Red Hatters’ passion comes from an e-mail by a principal\nsoftware engineer, Stephen Gallagher, posted for the entire company in the\nmidst of a busy—and stressful—time:\n\n> > I just want to call out something I’ve seen today that makes me proud to\n> be a Red Hatter. As most of the people reading this know, today has been a\n> major crunch day in engineering. We’re racing to land our final changes to\n> prepare for the RHEL 7.0 beta and there have been many issues. Brew is\n> overworked and taking hours to process builds; Bugzilla is slow, we’re\n> discovering new and fun bugs in errata tool . . .\n\n> > And yet, as I watch this happening, I notice something interesting. While\n> there’s plenty of opportunity to be complaining about the situation, that’s\n> not really occurring. Development and Release Engineering are talking,\n> helping each other out and looking for solutions to move forward. I see no\n> accusations, no infighting and no snark.\n\n> > This right here is exactly what Red Hat’s culture of contribution and\n> meritocracy is meant to inspire, and I just want to say “Thank You” to\n> everyone that is living this ideal. You continue to make Red Hat one of the\n> greatest companies to work for.\n\nIn turn, Paul Frields, the manager of Fedora Engineering, replied:\n\n> > I couldn’t agree more with this. When push comes to shove, Red Hat culture\n> says we should go out of our way to help co-workers. That’s precisely what I\n> see going on, and I’m overjoyed by that. “When the times get tough, the\n> tough get going” is a well-used cliché, but it’s really appropriate today.\n> Red Hatters rock!\n\nAssociates’ willingness to share their passions so openly completely changes\nwhat it means to be their leader. I don’t have to instruct everyone to “play\nnice” to make sure we meet our deadlines, because everyone already knows we\nare working together to accomplish something that is fundamentally good.\nDuring my first few months at Red Hat, I thought it was strange that I was\nbeing copied on many “thank you!” or “great job!” notes that the management\nteam sent. This rarely happened at Delta or at BCG. But this behavior is\nembedded deep into Red Hat’s DNA, where everyone tends to err on the side of\nover-thanking people and going out of his or her way to acknowledge the good\nwork others are doing. When you have passion inside your organization as Red\nHat does, a leader and manager’s role becomes more about creating context and\nreinforcing what purpose and end goal the organization is working toward.\n\nHaving boundless passion for the mission is common in start-ups. You might\neven argue that it’s a prerequisite to getting a business off the ground. But\none of the challenges any organization has is how to keep the level of passion\nhigh even as it continues to grow and add new people in different locations.\nThere are more than seven thousand Red Hatters, for example, spread among more\nthan eighty offices and working remotely worldwide. To help stoke the flames\nof passion in every location, we have an internal employment branding team\nthat celebrates the people and activities that drive company culture forward\nand then takes that culture external to attract like-minded candidates to our\ngrowing company.\n\nA key project for the team is a quarterly video, “The Show,” which captures\nthe essence of some of the most interesting things, people, and happenings\ninside Red Hat worldwide. For example, “The Show” might highlight one Red\nHatter who makes his own Iron Man Halloween costume using open source designs\nhe pulled from the internet. Or, it might feature a profile of someone like\nMichael Tiemann, vice president of open source affairs, who, besides being one\nof the preeminent thinkers in the open source community, is also a music\naficionado who built his own recording studio, Manifold Recording, using open\nsource designs and software. We might also have a segment about the different\nways groups of Red Hatters have given back to the community. “The Show” also\nhighlights different Red Hat offices worldwide as a way to celebrate our\ninternational and cultural diversity.\n\nVideo is a much more powerful way to make these connections than just a\ncorporate newsletter sent to everyone. It’s a better medium for capturing the\nvisceral nature of passion. And passion tends to rise when people are\ntogether. So, we work hard to make sure “The Show” is not just a link on the\nintranet that nobody clicks on. We promote it by holding a viewing party in\nevery Red Hat office, where Red Hatters can meet people from other teams,\nconnect with old friends, and laugh together at the video, while also enjoying\nfood and perhaps an adult beverage or two. “The Show” even highlights some of\nthe more creative parties that different Red Hat offices throw to watch the\nvideo.\n\nIn addition, we now set aside an entire week each year to celebrate our\npeople, culture, and brand—“We Are Red Hat Week.” While possibly sounding\narrogant, it’s really a purpose-driven exercise to reinforce what the company\nstands for and what we believe in—all of which got its start on Halloween in\n1994 when Marc Ewing first released Red Hat Linux. We’ve continued that\ntradition by making Halloween more than just about costumes and candy; we now\ncelebrate the culture of Red Hat. I dress up at the annual Halloween party\nduring “We Are Red Hat Week” and perform a skit with other senior executives.\nIt’s like a team-building event or even like Homecoming Week at your alma\nmater; it’s a chance to bond over shared experiences and to build anticipation\nfor creating even more reasons to celebrate in the future.\n\nThe practice is fairly common at organizations that foster the passion of\ntheir workforces. Zappos, for example, holds a companywide meeting every\nquarter that is “like a high school play mixed with presentations about\ncompany updates. At this meeting, employees have an opportunity to showcase\ntheir talents on stage, whether playing an instrument, dancing, or singing. It\nmay be perceived as all fun and games, but this production also has a huge\nteam-building component that requires employees from all departments to\ncollaborate and organize.”[14](index_split_019.html#filepos414519)\n\nBy bringing associates together once a year to celebrate our identity as a\ncompany, we increase engagement, loyalty, and a healthy sense of pride, which\nwill contribute to increased corporate revenue and growth for Red Hat as a\nwhole. To accomplish that, we use an open source methodology and collaborative\napproach to build the content and the activities of the week, which range from\ngames and volunteer events to the sharing of important company topics, such as\ncorporate strategy, definitions of a brand, and product and technology\ninsights. It’s far more than just “spirit week” or a coffee mug for associates\none day of the year. It’s harnessing the essence of the company—our people,\nculture, and brand—and spending a whole week exploring it, connecting with\neach other, and becoming more in tune with who we are and what we stand for.\n\nEach year, we focus on a theme based on where the company is. In 2013, for\ninstance, the theme was unification among our more than eighty offices. In\n2014, the focus was on moving forward together. Whatever the next twenty years\nthrows at us, we can proceed with confidence, knowing that the best way to\nmove forward is to move together.\n\nRed Hat even leans on its community when deciding which charitable or\nnonprofit organizations to support. Donating money becomes another way to\nengage associates in the efforts they are most passionate about and meld their\npersonal passions to what we do within the workplace. “We do it a little\ndifferently here, and the way the program came about and has grown is a pretty\ngood illustration of our culture and values,” said Melanie Chernoff,\ngovernment and community affairs manager at Red Hat, who joined the company\nnearly eight years ago as an intern. Chernoff now chairs the corporate\ncitizenship committee, which oversees Red Hat’s worldwide charitable\ndonations, associate matching-gift program, volunteer activities, and local\ncommunity relations efforts.\n\nChernoff says that when she joined Red Hat after working for several years in\nthe nonprofit sector, there was one committee in the headquarters office\ncharged with charitable donations but no real strategy to determine which\norganizations would receive financial support. After she asked to join a\nmeeting of that committee, her persistent questions and suggestions encouraged\nthe other committee members to name her their new chair. “At Red Hat, if you\nhave good background knowledge and have enthusiasm for something,” says\nChernoff about our meritocracy, “eventually someone will say, ‘Congrats! This\nis now yours.’ This is definitely a culture that allows you to follow your own\npersonal passion.”\n\nIn her new role, Chernoff headed up efforts to transform how Red Hat would\ngive back, including sponsoring an anonymous survey issued to every associate\nabout what kinds of organizations they supported personally and which they\nthought Red Hat should support. What Chernoff found was that Red Hat’s\nassociates made clear distinctions between the two. Where individuals might be\npassionate about the environment or art, for example, they felt the company\nshould support organizations in four key areas: basic needs, health,\neducation, and technology.\n\nWith those priorities identified, Chernoff again turned to the Red Hat\ncommunity to best determine which organizations in those categories would\nreceive the Red Hat’s support. While there is admittedly executive involvement\nin the process in setting budgets, there is a strong commitment to let the\nassociates run it from there.\n\n“We are unusual in that we don’t have a vice president of corporate\ncitizenship or a foundation like many companies our size do,” Chernoff says.\n“It is really about engaging our people, which is why we rely on associates\naround the world who volunteer their time to serve on committees.” Red Hat\nestablishes committees in the different geographic areas in which we operate.\nWe give each a pot of money to distribute every year to best engage their\nassociates in that area. The overarching corporate citizenship committee\nprovides advice and support to the local committees as needed, as well as\nimplementing matching-gift and volunteer programs that also rely on the power\nof the community, not just an executive team, to decide where to apply our\nefforts.\n\nOnce you give power to the community to make decisions, its members begin to\napply that responsibility in interesting and powerful ways. For example, in\n2008, when the economic recession hit and the holidays approached, it was\nimpossible to turn on the TV or read a news story that didn’t mention massive\nlayoffs and the number of people who would soon be unemployed. While we were\nfortunate at Red Hat not to have to do anything that drastic, the notion of\nholding a large holiday party struck a sour note with many US associates whose\nfamily, friends, and neighbors were out of work.\n\nThat groundswell of support led to a change. Rather than throw a large gala\nevent in Raleigh as we had done in the past, we instead held a modest party in\nour office. We donated the difference in what we would have spent on the party\nto a national charity chosen by associates. The US associates nominated thirty\ndifferent organizations, and the North America committee vetted the\nnominations, selected five finalists, and put them up for a vote. That first\nyear, the associates voted for America’s Second Harvest, a national network of\nfood banks; the program has continued in similar fashion with organizations\nlike the Wounded Warrior Project, charity: water, Meals On Wheels, and\nCommunities In Schools receiving our support during the holidays. The annual\nholiday donation is now one of the most popular company traditions with our\nassociates.\n\nKeep the Fires in Check\n\nA leader’s role can also involve keeping a passionate organization\nconstructively focused when things begin to run amok, which they undoubtedly\nwill. For some leaders, that could be considered a significant downside of\nintroducing and stoking the emotions of the workforce. We have had disruptive\nbattles flare up inside the organization when the “freedom fighters” face off\nagainst the “capitalists” over key decisions related to the kinds of\ntechnology we use at an enterprise level all the way down to the desktop. For\nRed Hat, these valuable debates impact our culture, but they are also times\nwhen our emotions can get the best of us. Sometimes, emotions make us lose\nsight of the facts in a situation—we tune out the merits of something we don’t\nagree with. But, the upside outweighs any potential downside. We have worked\nhard to find ways to keep our emotions from overwhelming us. We have learned\nthe value of hitting the pause button and having a difficult conversation\nabout why we did what we did (something I’ll cover in more detail in [chapter\n5](index_split_013.html#filepos231124)). The point is that as an organization,\nwe have had to learn how to best balance our passions so that they don’t\nbecome destructive.\n\nIf you look through the right lens, every organization has the potential for\nworld-changing impact. The role of a leader is to foster passion around that\nimpact and to keep that passion alive by reinforcing it every day. In Red\nHat’s case that means advocating for the power of open source or championing\nits role in bringing positive change to the world. Our organization continues\nto pursue that purpose by making investments in open source beyond those\nrequired for our business, such as supporting free and open fonts anyone can\nuse without the encumbrance of copyrights that would force payment for them.\nRed Hat’s legal team tirelessly works to defend software freedom in the\ncourts. We also support other organizations like the Software Freedom Law\nCenter, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Creative Commons to show that\nwe truly believe in the power of open source principles.\n\nIf your workers believe that what they are doing in their daily roles means\nfar more than simply padding the company’s bottom line, that they truly have\nan impact on the world in some way, what they can accomplish will be amazing.\n\nJim’s Leadership Tips\n\n> 1.Passion is contagious. Begin to personally display emotion, and others\n> will follow.\n\n> 2.Most companies have a stated purpose or mission. If yours doesn’t,\n> advocate to develop one. If it does, make sure you integrate it into your\n> dialogue with others. It needs to be part of everyday discourse.\n\n> 3.Add passionate words to your vocabulary at work, like “love,” “hate,”\n> “excited,” or “upset.” It should be easy—you already use them at home.\n> Others will start to use them if you do.\n\n> 4.Add questions to tease out passion when you interview. Ask “what are you\n> passionate about?” or “what inspires you?”\n\n> 5.Create vehicles for people to show their unvarnished selves. Company\n> outings or team-building events need to allow for some silliness.\n\n\n3\n\nBuilding Engagement\n\nLeaders at large, conventional organizations often ask me how it feels to lead\nan engaged, participative organization. That’s a critical issue, especially\nbecause Gallup research shows that only 13 percent of employees worldwide are\nactively engaged at work, and more than twice that number are so disengaged\nthey are likely to spread negativity to\nothers.[1](index_split_019.html#filepos414783) Many executives see companies\nlike Google, which gives away food and other perks, and think that building an\nengaged workforce is about lavishing things on your employees. Certainly perks\nlike great sushi may get people to stick around the office longer, but they\naren’t in themselves tools that engage.\n\nTrue engagement comes from, well, engaging. It’s about leaders making\nthemselves available for constant dialogue with employees. When I bring up\nthis point in conversations with peers in the executive ranks, I often get\nblank stares and questions like, “That sounds like a massive time sink. It\ncan’t be worth it, right?” Or, “We’ve invested heavily in internal\ncommunications capabilities to discuss what’s happening at the company.” Or\neven, “Employees are welcome and encouraged to listen to our earnings call.”\nI, too, used to struggle with how best to describe what we do at Red Hat as\nfundamentally different from simply proactively pushing out information to\nemployees.\n\nBut I have come to appreciate that, as technology has automated rote tasks and\nas business strategies rely more on employees’ initiative and innovative\nabilities, there is greater need for them to deeply understand and support the\ndirection of the company. It’s not just the changing nature of business\nstrategies that are driving the need for engagement. It’s the next generation\nof our workforce as well. Millennial workers have far greater expectations\nthan their parents for being heard in the workplace. If you want to recruit\nthe best and brightest talent and then keep them engaged in their jobs, you’ll\nneed to become far more accountable to them in terms of explaining why you\nmade certain decisions, and own the results as well.\n\nIn their book, Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve Extraordinary Results\nwith Ordinary People, Stanford professors Charles O’Reilly III and Jeffrey\nPfeffer conclude that if companies create a culture in which employees take\npsychological ownership, even average employees can perform at high\nlevels.[2](index_split_019.html#filepos415222) If employees feel that they are\nlistened to and appreciated—that is, when they are engaged—great things can\nresult.\n\nConsider the Rochester, New York–based grocery chain, Wegmans Food Markets,\nwhich is renowned for its workplace culture, exceptional product range, and\nsuperlative customer service. As one employee noted during the company’s\napplication to a “best places to work” list, “I contribute something really\nmeaningful. This company takes pride in empowering its people to a point where\nthey do not feel like they are just ‘doing a job,’ they are actually playing a\npivotal role in the company.”[3](index_split_019.html#filepos415598)\n\nI described the importance of purpose and passion in [chapter\n2](index_split_009.html#filepos64768); there is a tendency for managers to\nconfuse these concepts with engagement. But purpose and passion are about\ncreating meaning and excitement in one’s work, while engagement is more about\nchanneling that energy toward the specific areas that drive a company’s\nsuccess. It’s about attention to the whats and hows of the company’s\nstrategies and tactics. It’s about proactively being involved, curious, and\nquestioning what the company is doing and each individual’s role in making it\nsuccessful. Put another way, if you want to build engagement, you need to stop\nthinking in a conventional organizational manner.\n\nPurpose and passion go a long way to creating the motivation for being\nengaged, but neither creates engagement per se. There are obviously people who\nare very excited about the overarching mission or purpose of a company but\nfail to understand its strategy for achieving that purpose. Most people at Red\nHat are passionate about open source, but that doesn’t mean they are\nautomatically engaged with the company and buy into the ways we are working to\nachieve our purpose. The leadership team and I must ensure that happens.\n\nMany executives with whom I speak also confuse engagement with happiness or\nemployee morale. Engagement isn’t about being happy. Happy people may or may\nnot be engaged in the business. According to Sue Moynihan, a director on the\nPeople team at Red Hat, companies tend to confuse “job satisfaction” levels\namong their associates with engagement. So rather than ask associates about\nhow they feel about their compensation or benefits package—which are more\nclosely tied to satisfaction—Moynihan’s team measures associate engagement\nlevels by tracking how many people react affirmatively to statements such as:\n\n  1. The people I work with are passionate about Red Hat’s mission.\n  2. Associates at Red Hat take accountability for their work.\n  3. I believe Red Hat has a culture that allows me to learn and grow.\n\nWe also use a tool, Net Promoter Score (NPS), which has gained prominence\nthroughout the business world as a way companies can ask customers if they\nwould recommend their products or services to friends and family. At Red Hat,\nwe’ve turned NPS into an internal tool and ask associates how willing they are\nto recommend working at Red Hat to their acquaintances, with the idea that\nonly engaged associates would pass along an enthusiastic\nendorsement.[4](index_split_019.html#filepos415845)\n\nNone of the questions we ask attempt to measure morale or how happy people\nare. They measure knowledge of the business, how that applies to individual\njobs, and perceptions of whether the rest of the organization is equally\nengaged. “If you’re engaged, you’re happier with your job, more interested in\ncreating quality work, more productive, and more likely to recommend Red Hat\nas a great place to work,” Moynihan told me.\n\nAt Delta, someone asked me, “What are you going to do about our morale?” My\nanswer was, “Nothing.” Morale is an output of many things. If employees\nbelieve in and are passionate about their purpose, have the tools they need to\ndo their work well, and are engaged in what they are trying to accomplish,\nthen they’ll most likely have high morale. But the answer to low morale is to\nfocus on purpose, tools, and engagement, not directly on trying to make people\nhappy in and of itself. That’s treating the symptoms, not the cause. People\nneed to believe that the company and its leaders care about them. We see this\ntheme in our survey results—Red Hat cares about its people, their workspace,\ntheir health, their needs. We are a community in that sense, and that’s a big\npart of building morale.\n\nIf a key goal of the open organization is to build the capability for members\nto make their own decisions, act quickly, take initiative, and creatively\nsolve problems, then engagement is critical. I’ve heard many times—and\ncorrectly, I believe—that a leader’s primary job is to create context for his\nor her organization. As Howard Behar, former president of Starbucks, once\nsaid: “The person who sweeps the floor should choose the broom … We need to\nget rid of rules—real and imagined—and encourage independent\nthinking.”[5](index_split_019.html#filepos416241) That is a powerful statement\nfor an organization with more than twenty-three thousand locations worldwide,\nwhere thousands of its employees deal one-on-one with its customers. Having\nthat kind of trust in an employee is a powerful statement that will, in most\ncases, bring out the best in that employee.\n\nThe department store Nordstrom is renowned for its exceptional customer\nservice. When new hires join, they are given a one-page employee manual that\nstates: “Welcome to Nordstrom. We’re glad to have you with our Company. Our\nnumber one goal is to provide outstanding customer service. Set both your\npersonal and professional goals high. We have great confidence in your ability\nto achieve them. Nordstrom Rules: Rule #1: Use good judgment in all\nsituations. There will be no additional rules. Please feel free to ask your\ndepartment manager, store manager, or division general manager any question at\nany time.”[6](index_split_019.html#filepos416489)\n\nThat statement applies to leaders at every level of an open organization. It\nis dramatically easier and more effective when the people you are leading are\nproactively seeking that context. Similarly, initiatives aimed at offering\ngreater transparency, information, and so on to all associates can be\npowerful, but if people aren’t fundamentally engaged—if they don’t care—then\nthey really won’t believe it anyway.\n\nThe Power of Engagement\n\nMy ah-ha moment about the importance of building engagement by communicating\nboth the good news and the bad with your employees—and my conviction that this\ncan be replicated at virtually any company—came when I was still working at\nDelta. Specifically, it was the day Delta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nprotection. I was the chief operating officer at the time and responsible for\ndeveloping and driving the turnaround plan. I had spent an exhausting several\nmonths either locked up with a small group of advisers working on the plan or\nin a New York conference room pitching our plan to raise financing from\nlenders.\n\nThe day the company filed for bankruptcy was horrible for every member of the\nDelta family. For me, it was also a crazy day of press interviews, calls, and\nmeetings. At some point, I was asked if I would be willing to stop by the\nbreak room at the airport that night to meet with the night-shift line\nmechanics. Our turnaround plan included significant changes to maintenance in\naddition to pay and benefit cuts, so all of those employees would be\nnegatively affected. I was running from one thing to another and, without much\nthought, I said, “Sure.” I didn’t realize at the time that the suggestion to\ngo meet with those mechanics would become the best advice I’ve ever gotten.\n\nBy the time I arrived at the break room, I was exhausted. This wasn’t a\npreplanned, prescripted event. As I walked in, I realized I had no idea what I\nwas going to say, but there were a couple hundred people staring at me and\nwaiting for me to speak. I decided that the best thing to do was to tell them\nthe truth. I said that I was sorry and that the turnaround would require real\nsacrifices, but I also let them know that they were part of our holistic plan\nto revive the airline. I then launched into the same forty-five-minute speech\nabout our plan that I had been giving to the bankers in New York for the prior\nfew weeks. At the end, I apologized again, letting them know that management\nhad failed them, but we had a plan to fix the problems. There was a lot of\ndetail about arcane network and fleet concepts, but I thought it was important\nfor everyone to understand how his or her sacrifices fit into the whole plan.\n\nWhen I finished, I think everyone was a little stunned; at first, they just\nlooked at me. Then they started asking questions—lots of them. Most\nimpressively, the questions weren’t about the pay cuts and benefits changes.\nInstead, people asked insightful and detailed questions about the plan itself.\nThey were truly interested in how it would work and what they could do to make\nthe plan successful.\n\nI finally made it home and got some sleep, but word quickly spread about my\ntrip to the break room. Suddenly, I had requests from areas across the company\nthat wanted to hear the same speech. Those requests led to a more formal\nprogram that we called the “Velvet Rope Tour,” where I joined other Delta\nleaders and spent time with groups of several hundred employees at a time,\ncandidly sharing our plan and answering questions. Employees were pleased that\nthe company respected them enough to share a high level of detail about our\nvision for Delta’s future and how we came to the decisions we’d made. In turn,\nwe saw a substantial jump in engagement, despite the fact that our employees’\njobs were at risk.\n\nSkipping ahead a few years, I was walking through the international terminal\nin Atlanta when two Delta mechanics approached me. They mentioned the speech I\nhad given and thanked me again for laying out the plan, notably the details I\nshared about our intent to expand Delta’s international presence. They had\nboth taken that plan to heart and transferred to the international concourse,\nknowing they would be a big part of the company’s turnaround. That was\nincredibly gratifying for me, and I had tears in my eyes as I thanked those\ntwo gentlemen and went on my way.\n\nIn the end, I garnered many great lessons from those experiences, such as:\n\n  * Bad or tough news is much better accepted when delivered in person. Be open and honest. Don’t sugar-coat bad news.\n  * People thirst for context; they want to know the whats and whys of their company’s direction, and they want to be part of making it successful.\n  * Being accessible, answering questions, admitting mistakes, and saying you’re sorry builds your credibility and authority to lead.\n\nAll employees want a sense that their work is making a difference. They want\nto know how what they do is important to the whole. My Delta experience\ndemonstrates that people are willing to make substantial personal sacrifices\nif they believe they are part of a broader plan for success. Leaders often\nunderestimate the importance of creating that context and overestimate how\nmuch people know about the strategic direction of their organizations.\n\nEngagement Is the Foundation\n\nOf course, many companies and leaders understand the value of having an\nengaged workforce. What’s different in an open organization is that it’s not a\n“nice to have” overlay. It’s actually a key component of the management\nsystem, especially as it applies to getting work done effectively. To put that\nanother way, if you have an engaged workforce, it actually changes where and\nhow you make decisions regarding what needs to get done. When you consider\nthat thousands, if not millions, of decisions can be made within an\norganization every day, your ability to make faster and better decisions can\nhave a massive impact on the competitiveness of your organization.\n\nOne major function of any management system is to effectively identify and\nreact to changes in the marketplace. To me, the best articulation of this\nprocess comes from John Boyd, a US Air Force colonel and military strategist,\nwho created the OODA loop. He originally conceived of OODA (observe, orient,\ndecide, act) to describe the process a fighter pilot must go through to win a\ndogfight (see figure 3-1).\n\nFigure 3-1\n\nThe OODA loop\n\n![](images/00006.jpg)\n\nThe idea is that we are constantly processing information that we\nobserve—whether the location of enemy combatants or the actions of our\ncompetitors—before choosing to act on those observations. Therefore, the\nfaster you can close the loop between new observations and take action, the\nmore effective those actions will be. Consider the example of a fighter pilot\nflying a routine scouting mission. Out of the blue, he runs into enemy forces\nintent on shooting him down. That pilot might be required to report his\nsituation to his commanding officers before he’s allowed to fight back, which\nobviously puts his life in danger. If he’s given more leeway to act on his own\nobservations, he should be able to more effectively deal with the situation,\nbased on those observations.\n\nIn conventional organizations, the OODA loop functions within a hierarchy that\nis similar to a pilot waiting for orders. Standardized management reports and\ncommunications working their way up the hierarchy through the chain of command\nare the “observe and orient” functions. Decisions are then made somewhere in\nthat chain, and directions are subsequently passed back down for action. One\nrisk of this system is that useful information is filtered or lost, and\ntherefore important signals are missed. Another is the amount of time it can\ntake for information to flow up, decisions to be made, and directives for\naction sent back. As the pace of business accelerates, those flaws are\nexacerbated.\n\nBut an open organization management system can be much more effective because,\nfor the most part, it empowers the people making the observations to act on\nthat information rather than pushing it up the ladder and waiting for orders.\nThis obviously assumes that people observing the situation have enough context\nand knowledge to know what observations require changes. For the most part,\npilots have the leeway they need to decide on their own actions, but they have\nbeen well trained for this.\n\nAn obvious question is, how do employees know when the barrage of information\ncoming at them represents an opportunity or a threat? Empowering your workers\nto act unilaterally to changes they observe requires that they have the\nknowledge and context of the strategy so that they act appropriately.\nEngagement, therefore, is a critical element to the distributed management\nsystem we have at Red Hat.\n\nEven so, isn’t there a risk that workers will make poor decisions? Yes, but\nthat’s mitigated by the adoption of the open source principle of “release\nearly; release often”—or “fail fast”—that entails tightening that feedback\nloop (I’ll cover this in more detail in [chapter\n7](index_split_016.html#filepos334418)). Here at Red Hat, people managers play\na critical role in this process. They must determine the appropriate amount of\nlatitude that each individual is capable of handling, plus develop, coach, and\nstretch their capabilities along the way. To make this work, everyone in the\norganization must have a sense of the strategy, why it will be successful, and\nhow his or her individual actions can contribute toward those goals. But\nthat’s the definition of engagement, which is why having engaged employees is\nso important to the operation of an open organization.\n\nEngagement also greatly improves another key management function—control. Not\nonly are engaged organizations quicker to act, but they also require far fewer\ntop-down controls. In many ways, the more engaged an organization is, the more\nself-policing it will be. If you no longer rely on conventional top-down\nmanagement hierarchies to solve problems, you need to encourage and empower\nthe members of your organization to solve their own issues. Consider how open\nsource communities operate when there is no leader or group of leaders\nofficially in charge. Rather, there are people who are charged with making\ndecisions based on the input they receive from the group. When someone goes\nastray, the community itself resolves the issue. That’s not to say that people\ncan’t be trusted. It’s just that the more you are accountable to your peers,\nthe more aware you’ll be of the impact of your decisions and actions. That\nmeans employees and contributors are expected to work out issues among\nthemselves, rather than bumping them up through the hierarchy for resolution,\nas in so many conventional corporate cultures. An open organization is focused\non driving innovation and keeping ahead of market trends, not devoting scarce\npeople power to missteps better left for peers to solve. Too many\norganizations tend to get sucked down into creating policies and procedures\naimed at quelling misbehavior, which is truly a waste of a talented person’s\ntime and energy.\n\nFor example, if someone uses memo-list, our companywide e-mail list that\nreaches every Red Hatter, or any of our other internal communication tools in\nways that contradict the values of the Red Hat community, he or she will pay a\nprice. Managers at Red Hat coach their direct reports to work out their own\nissues, rather than immediately jumping in to act as mediator. “If you’re a\njerk and misbehave, you get frozen out and rendered ineffective and miserable,\nso there’s a much higher penalty than a manager could ever induce for not\nbeing cooperative,” said Máirín Duffy, a user-interface designer based in the\nWestford, Massachusetts office.\n\nSimilarly, Red Hat management trusts its community of associates to create\nground rules when they’re necessary. Sometimes, self-enforcement manifests\nitself in unexpected ways. An infamous story lovingly remembered as the “Bagel\nTouching Incident” involved an associate who took a bagel from a plate in the\nkitchen of the Raleigh office, then apparently decided to eat only half of it\nbefore returning the rest to the plate. When other associates noticed what had\nhappened, they took to the Raleigh office e-mail list, which we call rdu-list,\nto decry the anonymous person’s behavior. Someone also taped up a sign in the\nkitchen that said, “No bagel touching.”\n\nA similar incident occurred when one associate parked his or her car in a\nspace reserved for a motorcycle. Within hours, pictures of the offending car\nfound their way onto the rdu-list, along with associate-rendered ASCII-art\ndiagrams and suggestions for painting better lines in the Raleigh parking\ngarage.\n\nClearly, self-enforcement is not all about high-minded debate and grim\npunishment; it often involves humor and lightheartedness. But peer-to-peer\nmanagement isn’t just about enforcement; it’s also a critical form of\ncelebration and support. That means that every associate relies on his or her\npeers for the praise and acknowledgment that most companies give only their\nmanagers the power to bestow. “One of the things I appreciate the most about\nRed Hat is that we don’t just call each other on our B.S.,” Thomas Cameron, a\nchief architect, told me. “I am constantly impressed how often people point\nout when things go right. And it’s not fake cheerleader stuff either. People\nwill tell you, ‘Thanks for kicking ass,’ and really mean it.”\n\nLeveraging 360-Degree Accountability\n\nIn the conventional industrial model of labor management, managers managed and\nlaborers worked. There was very little expectation that management would be\naccountable to labor. It would rarely have crossed a manager’s mind to explain\nthe rationale for decisions or directives. The mind-set was that workers would\nbe equally efficient regardless of how much they understood about the company.\nIn fact, they might be less efficient if they thought too much, slowing\nproduction lines and asking why. They were largely considered to be\nreplaceable cogs rather than valuable intellectual assets.\n\nEverybody knows what accountability is. In conventional organizations,\naccountabilities are clear, and they only go in one direction: up. Each person\nis accountable to his boss. That person is accountable to her boss. And so on.\nThat’s why accountability is neatly distributed and clearly rolls up. It’s\nsimple and scientific, and anyone who has ever had a boss knows what it is.\nBut being accountable doesn’t mean you have to ask for permission before you\nmake every decision. It’s not about saying, “May I?” all the time. Rather,\nit’s about being accountable for a set of outputs after the fact.\n\nSo the simplest way I can describe the role of a leader in building,\nfostering, and enhancing an engaged workforce is to say, “You are accountable\nto everybody.” That truly sets the appropriate bar for a leader’s actions to\ndriving deep engagement. For Chris Van Gorder of Scripps Health in San Diego,\nwhich employs more than thirteen thousand people in twenty-nine locations,\nmanagers are held accountable for quality, safety, and financial metrics, but\nalso for people metrics: “I always teach at the new manager orientation that\nyour biggest job in life is to take care of people. That is your job. If you\ntake care of people, they will take care of you. But I also talk about\nresponsibility and accountability. I am pretty harsh on accountability. My\ndefinition of accountability is, you can miss your targets once. You won’t be\nhere to miss them twice. Pretty\nsimple.”[7](index_split_019.html#filepos416651)\n\nI and all of Red Hat’s managers are accountable to everyone in the\norganization for:\n\n  * Knowing our strategy.\n  * Listening.\n  * Engaging.\n\nTo put that another way, my job is to explain not just what we’re doing as an\norganization, but also why we’re doing it. It’s to inform and give context for\nour collective actions. My job is also to take questions and feedback and\nengage associates in a conversation about the decisions we’re making as a\nteam.\n\nBut the truth, it seems, is that most leaders and managers find it difficult\nto make themselves accountable at work for a couple of reasons. First off, it\ntakes a lot of time to listen. You have to believe that it’s part of your job\ndescription to invest your time that way. As soon as you think that’s\nunproductive time, then it becomes brutally painful.\n\nEarly in my career, a senior partner in BCG’s change management practice told\nme that, if you really want people to understand something, you have to tell\nthem five times. I think she might have been conservative. Engaging with\npeople takes a ton of time. You can’t staff it out; you can’t delegate it. You\ncan use electronic tools to help facilitate communication, but you can’t\nautomate it either. It requires personal commitment. In the scope of the\nmyriad other things that today’s fragmented executives have on their plates,\nit’s an easy one to let go. There’s no immediate payback. The fruits of an\nengaged workforce come over time. You truly have to believe in the value, or\nyou won’t do it.\n\nYou won’t hear employees if you’ve delegated the task of listening. I make the\neffort to personally answer every e-mail I receive from Red Hat associates,\nthough I warn folks that it could take me a couple of days to respond. As a\nleader, your role isn’t to tell people what to do but to tell people how they\nare important and how they fit in.\n\nUnfortunately, few conventionally run organizations think about how they can\nuse the tools they have in place, including e-mail, to create the kinds of\ntwo-way conversations needed to build accountability. At Delta, for example, I\nwas the only executive who voluntarily gave out my e-mail address to every\nemployee (and I did the same thing when I joined Red Hat). I made it clear\nthat anyone could e-mail me anytime and that I would get back to him or her,\nif not immediately, in a reasonable amount of time. The result? It was as if I\nhad unleashed the floodgates of pent-up demand.\n\nI decided to share my e-mail address because, as I was walking through a\nmaintenance hangar one day, one of the mechanics stopped me and complained\nthat he had been using the company suggestion box, but clearly nobody was\nlistening. Knowing that was probably the truth, I told the mechanic he could\njust e-mail me directly instead. But after doing this for one employee, I\nrealized that I would probably get a lot of valuable feedback if I opened it\nup to everyone. It’s next to impossible for a frontline employee to send a\ndirect e-mail to top executives at any big, conventional organization. Which\nbegs the question, why? In my opinion, feedback is a gift. I want and need to\nhear from folks throughout the company.\n\nI once received an e-mail from a member of the airline maintenance department.\nThe question required a somewhat delicate answer, so I tried to answer as best\nI could. I then received a response asking if I would be willing to discuss\nthe issue further at a barbecue lunch the department was hosting the following\nweek. As soon as I got that, I was intrigued. So I just picked up the phone\nand called up my new pen pal to tell him I would be excited to attend. After I\nexplained who I was, there was a moment or two of silence on the other end of\nthe line. “A few of my colleagues bet me that it wasn’t really you answering\nyour e-mail,” he told me. That’s exactly why it does matter that you, as a\nleader, open yourself up to everyone you work with.\n\nWhile that’s not always easy to do, there are systems you can put in place to\nhelp. Starbucks, for instance, has a program called “Mission Review,” which\nencourages anyone in the organization to voice concerns about whether the\ncompany has strayed from its mission statement or guiding principles. The\nprogram has been a great success in that it generates thousands of comments\nfrom within the organization. Someone with knowledge of the issue or a member\nof the mission review team follows up on each\ncomment.[8](index_split_019.html#filepos416898)\n\nAt Red Hat, I’ve needed to take my own level of responsiveness to a new level.\nNow, in addition to answering e-mails and occasionally responding to an\nimportant tweet, I hold informal town hall meetings in our offices worldwide\nto answer associates’ questions. Yes, you can risk being overwhelmed at times,\nmaybe even criticized or taken aback by questions about problems you thought\nhad been solved. In my mind, that’s how progress occurs.\n\nMost leaders are wary of receiving lots of complaints. A number of Red Hat\nexecs, especially when wanting to make a significant change, will groan\nbecause they know that they will have to confront the inevitable complaints,\nquestions, and so on that come with working through changes. As one senior\nleader has said to me, “Everyone at Red Hat believes that it’s their God-given\nright to complain about anything and everything.” And frankly, they’re right.\nIt’s part of what engagement is all about. It’s painful and time consuming to\nhear a barrage of complaints, but the ultimate result makes it worthwhile. I’m\nfond of using the “it’s like eating your broccoli” analogy. Going through the\nprocess isn’t necessarily the most pleasurable experience, but it’s actually\ngood for you, and you’ll feel better in the end. At Red Hat, we’ve all seen\nthe results of the power of engagement. We all know it works and makes the\neffort worthwhile.\n\nBut it can be frustrating. Often, as a leader, you get excited to engage your\npeople in the things you want them to focus on. You set up town halls, chat\nsessions, and so on, only to find out that your people want to discuss other\nthings—things that you may not think are important or you simply don’t want to\nspend time on. It’s easy to feel as if those are a waste of time relative to\nthe key issues you’re trying to resolve. However, if these are the issues on\npeople’s minds, you need to address them proactively before they’ll engage on\nthe issues you want them to. It’s a give-and-take, and ultimately you end up\nwith better engagement.\n\nThe final barrier—and for many leaders, the most significant—is that it’s\nnever fun to admit your own mistakes. A painful experience for many of us,\nwe’d rather avoid it. A study of a thousand leaders and employees conducted by\nForum Corporation, a global consulting firm, found that only 19 percent of the\nemployees it surveyed said their bosses were willing to apologize if they made\na mistake.[9](index_split_019.html#filepos417059)\n\nWhy? The results showed that these conventional-style bosses were afraid of\nappearing incompetent or weak. Amazingly, 7 percent said they simply “didn’t\nhave to” apologize for making a mistake. I guess that makes sense if you fully\nbuy into the conventional hierarchical organization as the only way to\nmaintain order and get things done.\n\nA good example of how I learned to be accountable to my team at Red Hat came\nin the wake of our acquisition of Qumranet. The decision was a bold step\nforward for the company into a white-hot sector called “virtualization,” a\ntechnical term for describing how you can get a computer to run multiple\noperating systems at the same time. Buying the company gave us a leadership\nposition in a key strategic area that underlies cloud computing. But while\nmuch of its technology was open source, key components had been written in\nanother proprietary language and were anything but open. Our internal tech\nestimated that it would take about six months to a year to rewrite those\npieces of code.\n\nThat left me in a dilemma. We had just spent more than $100 million to buy a\ncompany in a sector that was moving fast, and we would have to wait almost a\nyear before deploying it. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to go to\nmarket with what we had, with the idea that we would work in parallel to\nrewrite the code.\n\nThe end result was a giant dud. Not only did our associates hate using the\nproduct, they couldn’t support it well because they weren’t familiar with the\ncode. Worse, our customers—who choose us because we are open source—didn’t\nlike it either. It quickly became obvious that I had made a mistake and that\nwe would need to pull back the product and rewrite the code before we released\nit again. All in all, that mistake added up to about a year-and-a-half delay\ninstead of a six-month one. But I owned it. I admitted to the company and\nboard of directors that I was wrong and then hatched a plan to launch the\nproduct in a way that was true to Red Hat.\n\nThis example shows how essential it is to remain accountable to those affected\nby your decisions. Of course, there was quite a bit of anger and frustration\namong Red Hatters who wondered why the company was falling behind in the\nvirtualization market. I realized that our associates deserved to hear the\nstory of why we made the decision as much as the board did. When you don’t\nexplain your decision, people will often assume the worst: that you’re\ndetached, are dumb, or don’t care. But when I explained the rationale—that my\nmanagement team and I had, in fact, put a lot of thought into it—people\nfinally understood. Red Hat associates appreciated that I owned my mistake; I\nearned their trust by explaining my decision—which also makes you a stronger\nleader. If you want to have engaged employees, in other words, you need to\nexplain your decisions.\n\nThe key point for any leader is that you can build an enormous sense of trust\nand loyalty among employees when you actually take responsibility for your\nmistakes. For example, the Forum Corporation study also noted: “There can be\nno doubt that trust in leadership has a massive impact on workplace culture\nand business results. Employees that trust their leadership team are more\nloyal and efficient in their jobs. In fact, a solid foundation of trust can\nlead to increased productivity, profitability, and lower\nturnover.”[10](index_split_019.html#filepos417443)\n\nBeing accountable to your employees is so much more than simply apologizing\nfor your mistakes; it’s about sharing the rationale for why you made any\nsignificant decision if the members of your organization weren’t directly\ninvolved in making it (how to arrive at decisions is something I dig deeper\ninto in [chapter 6](index_split_015.html#filepos279794)). As a leader, your\nresponsibility is to create the context, framing, and explanation for why you\nchose a particular path. That means you’ll be explaining yourself a lot, which\ncan be really hard. Many CEOs complain about all the different “bosses” they\nhave—from board members to analysts on Wall Street. You potentially have\nthousands of bosses in the guise of your associates and community members.\nBeing accountable to all those folks is time consuming and emotionally\ndraining. But when you do it, the payoff is enormous.\n\nGenerally, there has been an increase in the acceptance and importance of the\nnotion of “corporate responsibility,” where companies have become accountable\nto more than just their shareholders and the bottom line. For instance,\ncompanies have become more involved with the communities they work in—either\nliterally, as in a town, city, or the environment, or virtually, as in the\ncase of the Linux community. To do this, leaders have had to adjust their\nmind-set about who and what they are accountable for.\n\nTo do this well, and at the scale we have at Red Hat, you’ll need to work hard\non how you communicate.\n\nThe Leader’s Role: Scaling Up Engagement\n\nSome CEOs believe in the power of proximity, where they want all their\nemployees working in the corporate headquarters as a way to facilitate\nconversations (and likely to keep an eye on employees as well). At Red Hat, we\nthink differently about how we connect thousands of associates, many of whom\nlive all over the world. There are obstacles to connecting so many people\nvirtually. More importantly, though, we have developed communications channels\nin a way that allows us to scale so we aren’t hampered by the fact that our\nassociates aren’t with us physically. As Richard W. M. Jones, a principal\nsoftware engineer at Red Hat, put it, “I don’t think it makes that much\ndifference, now that we’re a company of more than seven thousand people,\nwhether you’re remote or in an office. The chances of me working physically\nnear to people that I collaborate with is not high.” In other words, just\nbecause a person sits next to someone doesn’t solve the issue of how we can\nenable that same associate to communicate with an individual on the other side\nof the world.\n\nIn setting up employee communication systems, many companies make the mistake\nof thinking this problem can be solved simply by throwing technology at it.\nExecutives who still think conventionally might tell human resources or IT to\ngo out and buy collaboration tools. But, unless the company has the structure\nin place to let employees honestly talk to each other and their bosses, the\ntools won’t help. So managers should first listen and then find the right\ncommunication tools. The grocery chain Wegmans, for example, has come up with\na relatively low-tech solution it calls “Meeting in a Box,” a template of\ntalking points, videos, FAQs, and feedback-gathering tools that managers can\nuse to facilitate conversations about everything from health benefits to the\nfinancial state of the company.\n\nLow-tech “huddling” is also a common practice at any of the growing number of\ncompanies in the SRC Holdings family, an organization with more than twelve\nhundred employees and $400 million in sales, which originally spun out of a\nfailed International Harvester plant in 1982. Much of what SRC does is\nconnected to remanufacturing, or rebuilding everything from engine parts to\nelectronics used in farm combines. It’s the kind of work that requires you to\nget your hands dirty. But you can walk into any SRC factory on a given day and\nsee hundreds of associates gathered around an easel or a whiteboard showing\ntheir daily or weekly huddles. The company’s associates actively participate\nin understanding the health of the business by writing financial results on\nthe whiteboards. That practice is part of SRC’s famed open-book management\nsystem that uses transparency and financial literacy—along with low-tech tools\nlike whiteboards—to deeply engage associates. “The meetings are, in fact, just\none link in a chain of communication that is constantly moving information up\nand down the organization,” writes Jack Stack, SRC’s CEO, adding that when\npeople are given information, they begin to see the big picture as it relates\nto meeting their targets, earning a bonus, increasing the value of the\ncompany’s stock, and protecting their jobs. “One way or another, they are\nmoving in the right direction and in the same direction,” Stack said. “We are\nall working together to make those fractional improvements that determine\nwhether or not we succeed as a\nbusiness.”[11](index_split_019.html#filepos417570)\n\nSimilarly, at Red Hat, despite being a cutting-edge technology company, we\nprimarily rely on good old-fashioned, low-tech e-mail lists to help facilitate\nour conversations. We understand that participation is based on building that\nculture of accountability, not a set of tools. To help keep conversations on\npoint, people can use separate channels. Over time, new associates naturally\nfigure out what type of content belongs where. Here are a few examples of\ncommunication vehicles at Red Hat:\n\n  * Announce-list—An e-mail list for broadcasting information that probably won’t need or require conversation. If a post generates more than one response, it will typically move onto memo-list.\n  * Memo-list—An e-mail list where we post informal things that will likely have a companywide impact and where we expect significant debate to occur. It’s not atypical to have dozens or hundreds of messages on particularly important topics.\n  * A topic-specific list, such as Cloud-Strategy-List—Where associates most interested in cloud computing can discuss and debate topics in this area.\n  * Blogs—When someone has something really substantial and thoughtful to share, they blog about it. They know not everyone will read it, but it allows for much deeper exploration of narrower subjects.\n  * Wikis—When someone wants a more structured dialogue and more thoughtful feedback, the final weapon of choice is to use a wiki.\n\nConversations in these different channels can sometimes seem chaotic or even\nout of control. That’s okay. As a leader, you need to learn to not police the\nchatter too much. If you do, you risk dampening its power. I learned this\nthrough experience. At one point, memo-list had become almost too polluted\nwith nonbusiness-related items that many thought had simply gone too far. Some\nwere sending out funny pictures of cats, and consequently people were starting\nto tune out the important items we wanted to share around the company. My\ninitial instinct was to implement a set of rules to fix the problem.\nFortunately, before my conventional organization top-down instincts kicked in,\nI got some advice from other veteran Red Hatters who suggested that I reach\nout to the most active memo-list users and posters and ask them to come up\nwith the solution. And they did: they developed a set of guidelines and self-\nmonitored the list, coaching people who were posting material that did not fit\nthe role of the memo-list. They created another list for humorous material,\nbecause they recognized that associates, especially remote Red Hatters, wanted\nan outlet for sharing nonwork-related things with like-minded people. That was\na key lesson for me in terms of learning how to foster participation without\nsetting the rigid ground rules that tend to push associates away from\ncontributing.\n\nAs a global company, Red Hat also had to turn to other solutions that help all\nof us stay connected as a whole and as parts of smaller working teams. Since\neven scheduling a room for an in-person meeting or arranging a global\nconference call can be complicated in an organization like ours, one of the\ninternal teams put together a series of “connection tips” that highlight\nmethods and approaches people use to connect and collaborate, combined with\nsome perspective from the folks who actually put the tools to use:\n\n  1. IRC (or instant messaging). By far the most popular of all the tools, IRC is seen as a quick, casual, easy way to connect when you need to solve a problem or just stay in touch. “Instant Messaging (IM) is my lifeline. Sometimes just a quick answer is all that is needed and you don’t want the e-mail to get buried. So having the ability for the fast connection is the best. I love that our team is all on IM and we use it constantly,” commented Joan Richards, senior principal program marketing manager. According to Jennifer Scalf, technical account manager, “IRC lets me communicate with Red Hatters across the globe quickly. There are very few barriers; you can be anywhere chatting with someone else who is anywhere. Most of the time, whether it is in a channel or one-on-one with a person, the speed and effectiveness of using IRC to solve technical issues is amazing.”\n  2. E-mail. Although some felt it wasn’t always used effectively, e-mail has its place in collaboration efforts. “We use this as a fallback for when we can’t get a hold of someone. It’s really the slowest and least responsive of the technologies we use. But it’s persisted across days/weeks/etc.,” said Jason Connor, senior software engineer. Stephen J. Smoogen, Fedora team, added, “Always default to e-mail. It is a recorded media, it can be kept as a local copy, and it can hold a lot of data which might not be easily communicated in IRC or other things.”\n  3. Elluminate. The web-conferencing program is a great tool for sharing presentations and keeping a recorded copy. “I love to use phone and Elluminate (and recording for replays). I’ll share desktop/browser and slide deck to discuss topic of training session and allow real-time Q&A and demo of new feature/function in product releases,” commented Cliff Perry, manager of software engineering.\n  4. Etherpad/social intranet. These tools, which include one called Mojo, provide a lot of interaction and online collaboration on documents and notes. According to Peter Larsen, solution architect, “I use Mojo [our social intranet platform] to allow collaboration in regards to official documentation, presentations, etc., that I share with my peers (or they with me). We’ll communicate on e-mail/IM/IRC and share links to information on Mojo that we then work on.”\n  5. Video conferencing. Although sometimes the hardest to use, video conferencing helps generate a feeling of being there when face-to-face isn’t possible. “We have once-a-week meetings on video chat. It helps to see people’s faces and facial expressions . . . even though the same information could be communicated on IRC or e-mail. It takes a bit longer, but it is worth it,” said Michael Foley, quality engineering supervisor.\n\nThe good news about using simple technologies is that you don’t have to wait\nfor a corporate mandate or major program to implement a collaboration suite.\nAny group, department, or function can leverage existing tools to engage.\nCreating a departmental mailing list is generally easy to do. It’s not the\ntechnology that drives engagement. It’s the commitment of the leader to truly\nengage.\n\nScaling Engagement\n\nRed Hat also works to scale engagement beyond its walls and beyond the\nsoftware sector itself. To that end, we launched a site,\n[opensource.com](http://opensource.com), in 2010 (we had owned the URL for\nmany years) because we knew there were many inspiring stories about how the\nprinciples of open source—collaboration, transparency, meritocracy, and so\non—were being leveraged beyond the software industry. Our hope was to create a\nplace where anyone could learn about and share stories of the growing open\nsource movement.\n\nWe call [opensource.com](http://opensource.com) a “Red Hat community service”\nbecause we provide the hosting and editing for the site. But the\ncontent—articles about how the open source way has woven into areas such as\ngovernment, education, health, law, and life—comes from our extended\ncommunity, which includes Red Hatters. Over the years, the most popular\narticles have covered a range of technical topics, such as a discussion about\nthe top open source project management tools. But the site has also tackled\neverything from how open source helps libraries to how it might provide a\nsolution to the problem of bee colony collapse.\n\nSince launching the site, we have shared thousands of diverse open source\nstories and have gathered an impressive following. We’ve published thousands\nof articles and generated millions of page views. On social media, we have\ntens of thousands of Twitter followers and Facebook fans. We’re also growing\nour Google+ community and LinkedIn professionals group.\n\nJason Hibbets, who spearheads the effort for Red Hat, has worked to build a\ndiverse and growing community that already numbers hundreds of authors, some\nRed Hatters but many who are not. Additionally, the most engaged community\nmembers have taken on the role of community moderators and are leading the\ncontinued evolution of the site. These volunteer moderators don’t work for Red\nHat, but have a personal interest in the open source way. They contribute\ntheir time to write articles, engage with commenters, and spread the word\nabout content on social media. “[Opensource.com](http://Opensource.com) is a\ngreat example of the open principles of catalyzing a community and building a\nplatform that engages other people,” says Jeff Mackanic, Red Hat’s senior\ndirector of global awareness, who was instrumental in launching the site.\n\nWhile this community has helped plant the seeds of open source awareness,\nthere is much left to do. The door is open for the open source way to bring\nsuccess to nontechnology companies, schools, universities, governments—to the\nworld. I eagerly await the day when the open source way becomes the\nexpectation rather than the exception. [Opensource.com](http://Opensource.com)\nis a place where we can shine a light on the progress along the way, thanks to\nour active participative community.\n\nGo All the Way . . . or Don’t Start\n\nWhen collecting feedback from employees and customers, many companies still\nrely on an age-old standard: the suggestion box. Usually it’s some kind of\nlocked box stationed somewhere in the break room or similar area where\nmanagement encourages people to tell it how the business could do better. The\nidea, of course, is that management collects the ideas and complaints\nregularly and then addresses the most pressing issues or even the best ideas.\n\nBut we know what really happens with the suggestion box. Nothing. I recall\nwatching a television program on one of the food channels that features\nrestaurant turnarounds. I’m sure you know the format: a famous restaurateur\nparachutes in to save a struggling business. In this particular episode, the\nstruggling business owner pointed to a suggestion box as proof that he was\nlistening to his employees and customers. Not only had the restaurant owner\nnot bothered to check the contents of the box in some time, he had actually\nlost the key to it. The consultant used a sledgehammer to open the box as the\ncamera zoomed in and dozens of ignored suggestions floated to the floor.\n\nThe worst possible thing is if employees contribute their best ideas and\nnothing happens. Listening is simply not enough. Or the HR department runs the\neffort without any other senior leadership involvement. That tells your people\nnot to bother. Soliciting feedback and ignoring it is worse than not\nsoliciting it at all. But it takes time to do things the right way—a lot of\ntime.\n\nAccountability plays a huge role in building a collaborative and innovative\nworkplace. While you might go through the motions of putting out a suggestion\nbox so your employees and customers can speak up and connect with you, it\nwon’t mean a thing unless you’re serious about it. Ignoring your suggestion\nbox will only push your employees further away, creating the kind of cynicism\nthat becomes difficult to reverse. Employees simply won’t trust that you’re\nreally listening.\n\nWhile much of the feedback might not have any intrinsic value in isolation,\nthe overall benefits are huge. Not only do you get a few good ideas, but, more\nimportantly, you also get deep engagement from your employees. They will feel\nas if they are part of a living, breathing system, not mere cogs in the wheel.\n\nJim’s Leadership Tips\n\n> 1.Enter every interaction with people in your organization believing that\n> each person is equally accountable for his or her contributions and\n> performance to everyone else, regardless of reporting relationship.\n\n> 2.If your boss is not providing the appropriate context, ask for it.

You don’t have\nto know the specific people in the organization. All you have to see is the\norganization chart. In general, the higher on the chart, the more say a person\nhas. If an issue cannot be resolved at one level of the hierarchy, it moves up\nuntil there’s just one decision maker. It’s neat and orderly. But what happens\nwhen you work in an organization that isn’t a top-down hierarchy? Who makes\nwhat decisions? How are disagreements adjudicated?\n\nRed Hat still has organization charts, but how we make decisions doesn’t\nnecessarily follow that structure. We have modeled ourselves less on the\nfamiliar, traditional corporate hierarchy model and more on what the ancient\nAthenians, the founders of democracy, called politeia, a term they used to\ndescribe their society. To be a member of the Athenian politeia, according to\nthe authors of A Company of Citizens, meant that you thought, argued, and\nacted with your fellow citizens, and that you learned through the practice of\ncivic life. Each person was actively engaged in learning and seeking a common\npurpose. In other words, the Athenians lived in what they called “a community\nof citizens,” which was built upon a\nmeritocracy.[1](index_split_019.html#filepos417962) That system, when applied\nwithin a company of citizens, would be based on this recognition:\n\n> > Merit means that decisions are based on the best case put forward;\n> excellence, not position, prejudice, or privilege, is the criterion for\n> choice. In a company of citizens, the best case for action is that which\n> carries the day after the open, sufficient, and informed debate. Merit means\n> that every thoughtful and knowledgeable individual, with good ideas based on\n> real understanding, will get a hearing. The incompetent blowhard will not.\n> The practice of merit gives lie to the idea that participatory democracy\n> must devolve to the lowest common\n> denominator.[2](index_split_019.html#filepos418268)\n\nSimilarly, the primary responsibility for leaders at Red Hat is to build and\nsupport our meritocracy by making sure the right people are working together\non the right things. The people who are closest to the issue, rather than\nthose responsible for the overall direction of the organization or team, tend\nto make the decisions. This requires collaboration and mutual respect between\nassociates and their managers, in a complementary relationship. We try to have\nthe right people in charge of the right decisions and hope they have the\nhumility and organizational understanding to be open to influence and outside\nperspectives.\n\nFor example, at Stew Leonard’s, a chain of food stores in New York and\nConnecticut that is famed for its exceptional customer service, literally\nevery employee can do whatever he or she needs to—from answering questions to\nrejecting faulty merchandise—to ensure customer satisfaction without having to\nfirst get approval from management.[3](index_split_019.html#filepos418436)\nSimilarly, at Red Hat, we strive to ensure that the people most capable of\nmaking the decisions, regardless of their title, make the vast majority of our\ndecisions. But that raises two questions: Who is empowered to make a decision?\nWho decides who is empowered to make a decision?\n\nIt’s Not a Democracy\n\nMany people assume that if an organization is not top-down, then it must be\nsome flavor of democracy—a place where everyone gets a vote. In both\nhierarchies and democracies, decision making is clear and precise. It’s\nproscribed and can be easily codified. In most participative organizations,\nhowever, leaders and decision making don’t necessarily follow such clear\nrules, just as it was in ancient Athens, where literally every citizen had the\nsame opportunities to lead or follow others. Some people have more influence\nthan others. Some people state an opinion and quickly get others to fall in\nline. It’s not because they have positional authority. There is something else\nat work in these organizations. We’ve all seen it elsewhere, whether it’s a\nteenage daughter coping with the “queen bee” phenomenon or a social group in\nwhich there are one or two people who clearly run the show.\n\nExactly how leaders emerge and get others to follow in voluntary organizations\nhas been the subject of much research and writing, which is far beyond the\nscope of this book (though I do recommend reading A Company of Citizens for\nmore details on ancient Greek society). But it’s important to recognize that\ninformal leaders do emerge. And in less structured, less hierarchical\norganizations, they are a key part of the overall management system.\n\nAt Red Hat, some of the seven thousand voices inside the company have far more\nsway than others. In most cases, decisions aren’t made by executive fiat, nor\nare they arrived at through consensus. Rather, those people who have earned\ntheir peers’ respect over time drive decisions. Associates who make a positive\nimpact on the business and on the culture find that they gain more influence\nthan those who do not. That’s why we call our culture a “meritocracy,” which,\nif you use Wikipedia’s definition, means:\n\n> > A system of government or other administration (such as business\n> administration) wherein appointments and responsibilities are objectively\n> assigned to individuals based upon their “merits,” namely intelligence,\n> credentials, and education.[4](index_split_019.html#filepos418682)\n\nMichael Young coined the term in 1958 in his book, The Rise of the\nMeritocracy. Strangely enough, Young used the term satirically as he described\na dystopian future where a person’s place in society would be linked to his or\nher scores on standardized tests. But the term has evolved to take on a\ndeeper, more positive meaning. For example, when Liz Elting, cofounder of\nTransPerfect (the parent company of\n[Translations.com](http://Translations.com)), was asked how her business has\ngrown into a $350 million company with two thousand employees, she credited\nthe culture of meritocracy they have created:\n\n> > We did not know from day one how this meritocracy would develop or what\n> the best practices would be. What we did know was that a meritocracy was the\n> only model we felt we could truly believe in and fully support. We created a\n> foundation of accountability that not only gave our employees the motivation\n> to succeed, but also presented management with clear opportunities to\n> unequivocally note an employee’s success. By holding each individual\n> responsible for their goals and role within the company, we have been able\n> to empower each member of TransPerfect to take ownership of their\n> contributions and truly demonstrate their value. This core idea helped drive\n> our very first employees; 2,000 people later, it continues to drive our\n> business today.[5](index_split_019.html#filepos419092)\n\nWithin the meritocracy we have built at Red Hat, everyone has the right to\nspeak and access the kinds of tools that will help ensure that his or her\nvoice is heard. But to appreciate how a meritocracy works, you need to first\nrecognize that not everyone is listened to equally. That is to say, everyone\nhas an equal chance to be heard, but the meritocracy functions so that the\ncollective helps empower and choose the leaders and influencers.\n\nAt most companies, everyone knows who the “A-players” or “superstars” are,\neven if their title doesn’t necessarily convey how much influence they have\nwithin the company. When I worked at BCG, we used the terms “thermometers” and\n“thermostats” to categorize people in an organization. Thermometers are people\nwho reflect the temperature (hot, cold, or lukewarm) of the organization; the\nthermostats are the ones who set it. When it came time to create change in an\norganization, we knew we needed to get the thermostats on board to help drive\nthose changes by setting a new temperature that would be quickly reflected by\nthe thermometers.\n\nThe challenge for most companies, though, is that while everyone knows who the\nthermostats are, it’s very rare that anyone takes real advantage of his or her\npotential influence. The challenge and the opportunity for companies and\norganizations, therefore, are to find ways to not just openly recognize the\nthought leaders, but also to leverage the thermostats to drive innovation and\ndecision making forward. When it’s time to make big decisions or get people on\nboard with new initiatives, you need to find ways to get the thermostats\ninvolved in the action as early as possible. That’s how you can help ensure\nyour best chances at success.\n\nAn example of how we leverage our thermostats at Red Hat is Máirín Duffy, a\nuser-interface designer. Duffy started working at Red Hat as an intern and\nlater joined full-time in 2004 after she graduated from college. While Duffy\nhas made exceptional contributions to the core Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nproduct, she has also earned a stellar reputation throughout the company for\nher reasoned and intelligent contributions to memo-list conversations on\neverything from the creation of the mission statement to the adoption of\ncertain controversial proprietary software programs. In a case involving the\nlatter, DeLisa Alexander, executive vice president and chief people officer at\nRed Hat, approached Duffy to talk about such a proposed project. “DeLisa\napproached me in person—I had never met her in person before—because she knew\nfrom memo-list how vocally I was against Red Hat using proprietary software,”\nDuffy said. “She had caught wind of such a project and let me know about it,\nasked me what I thought, and supported my efforts to have it reconsidered. It\neventually was and didn’t move forward then as planned. The people who take\nthe initiative to make sure the right thing happens are the ones who end up\nwinning the influence.”\n\nThis is an example in which a senior leader in the company went directly to\nsomeone working close to the frontlines to gather feedback on a fairly major\ncorporatewide decision simply because Alexander, the executive, knew that\nDuffy, the designer, could help make or break the success of the final\ndecision, based on her level of influence throughout the company. That’s how a\nmeritocracy functions.\n\nThe Open Source Way: Leadership Is Earned\n\nThe first questions in building a meritocratic system are: How do you decide\nwhose ideas get more time and attention? How do you assign merit in a modern\ncorporation? Why would the opinion of someone like Máirín Duffy merit the\nattention of a high-level executive? Or, how does a fifty-year-old company\nlike W. L. Gore continue to be successful despite the fact that it has a\nuniquely egalitarian culture in which there are very few traditional job\ntitles and even fewer people considered to be bosses in any traditional\nsense?”[6](index_split_019.html#filepos419703) The answer is surprisingly\nsimple. To become a leader in a meritocracy, you need to attract followers\nfirst, not the other way around, as is typical in most conventional\norganization structures. Your peers actually have to select you as their\nleader based on how effective they think you are, not just because you have a\nmore impressive title or résumé.\n\nFor newcomers to Gore’s culture, especially those accustomed to a more\nconventional corporate environment, joining the company can be a somewhat\ndaunting experience:\n\n> > “When I arrived at Gore, I didn’t know who did what. I wondered how\n> anything got done here. It was driving me crazy.” She also didn’t know how\n> to work without someone telling her what to do, and kept asking “Who’s my\n> boss?” “Stop using the B-word,” she was told. She also saw that people\n> didn’t fit into pre-defined job slots; they had team commitments that often\n> combined roles traditionally done by different departments. It took a long\n> time to get to know people and what they did, and to earn the credibility\n> and trust required to be given responsibilities. But she did, and eventually\n> went on to become what she calls a “category champion.” Her experience is\n> the norm. Another associate with 20 years of experience on multiple teams,\n> observed: “You join a team and you’re an idiot . . . It takes 18 months to\n> build credibility. Early on, it’s really frustrating. In hindsight, it makes\n> sense.”[7](index_split_019.html#filepos420033)\n\nRed Hat’s culture and management system, which relies heavily on open source\nprinciples, is similar. A common saying in open source is, “The code talks.”\nIn other words, the folks who earn the most influence in any open source\nengineering project tend to be those individuals who contribute the best code\nor new ideas, or even have a gift for spotting bugs. There really is an\nobjective beauty to this principle because titles, experience, and politics\nbegin to matter far less than insight and sound reasoning. That’s how the best\nideas get acted on rather than the most popular ones, which is a subtle but\nextremely important difference.\n\nRed Hat has built upon this concept as well. Sure, our engineers earn\ninfluence with each other based on their contributions to the code. But the\nsame principle applies to all associates in the organization, regardless of\nwhat department they work in or what their day-to-day job entails. Everyone\nhas the ability to earn influence and to get his or her ideas heard. It simply\nrelates to how effective you are at presenting and getting people behind your\nideas, throughout the organization.\n\nRed Hatters like Máirín Duffy build their reputations and influence through\nsustained contribution. That means doing a great job, but also helping others\nand contributing to the multitude of internal discussion threads that are\nongoing at any one time. Some associates post a lot of their opinions, while\nothers are more judicious in the number of discussions they weigh in on. But\nthe path to building influence really is about quality over quantity. Frequent\nposters may find that they lose influence if their peers begin to treat their\ncontributions as mere noise. It’s like living in a small town where, no matter\nhow much you try to hide, everyone knows quite a bit about you based on how\nyou live your life.\n\nSuccessful open source software projects—and, by extension, open\norganizations—are those in which the most influence over the direction of the\nproject lies with the people who contribute the most meaningful work. In other\nwords, projects and organizations work best in the context of a meritocracy.\nHow, then, does this principle manifest itself at Red Hat? Who decides who\nleads and who follows? To answer these questions, we’ve taken a page from the\nopen source manual and allowed a meritocracy to grow.\n\nBuilding a Culture of Thought Leaders\n\nWhile most company hierarchies dictate who gets heard, the most influential\nvoices at Red Hat aren’t necessarily tied to someone’s title or even his or\nher longevity within the company. Instead, the most respected individuals tend\nto be those who have a track record of being consistent and selfless. You\ncan’t assume that your job title gives you credibility, any more than it does\nin a real community. People might watch you a little more closely because of\nit, but they’re looking for their own clues and assessing your importance by\ntheir own criteria.\n\nAt Red Hat, you also can’t gain influence or followers by gaming the system,\nas we often see in conventionally run organizations. We’re all familiar with\nthe folks who get labeled brownnoses or similar as they climb the ranks of\npolitical and bureaucratic hierarchies. They are the political animals in the\norganization. They make friends and allies mostly to help advance their own\ncareers. Yet, while everyone knows who they are, they still seem to get their\nway, because conventional bosses respond to that kind of sycophantic behavior.\n\nIt’s much harder to manipulate an open organization community like Red Hat’s.\nThere are too many people who will flag you for being insincere, and your\nreputation will suffer. Those people who are the most committed to the mission\nand purpose of the organization, on the other hand, and who work hard to\nfulfill its goals are those whose voices become the most predominant. So when\nI run into Thomas Cameron from time to time, I listen to him because I respect\nthe brand and reputation he has built within the company, not because he’s\ntrying to butter me up. At Red Hat, we revere our influencers wherever they\nwork. That’s the essence of a meritocracy.\n\nA meritocracy also means that you don’t need people reporting to you to create\nchange and get yourself heard—a notion that many organizations struggle with.\nRebecca Fernandez, a senior employment branding specialist at Red Hat,\nexplained it in her article “Building a positive meritocracy: It’s harder than\nit sounds”:\n\n> > Most people have experienced the Peter Principle in action: In a hierarchy\n> every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence. In other words,\n> people are promoted so long as they excel. When they are promoted to a\n> position where they lack competence, they stay there, unable to gain further\n> promotion and unlikely to be demoted. This happens because upward mobility\n> generally involves a move into management. The brilliant engineer becomes\n> the bumbling manager . . . To create a positive meritocracy, we must re-\n> envision management as a career track parallel to others (e.g., engineering\n> or marketing), with overlap for some dual-skilled\n> candidates.[8](index_split_019.html#filepos420608)\n\nAt Red Hat, we address the dangers of the Peter Principle by offering ways for\nan individual to grow his or her scope and influence without having to change\njobs. The people who are listened to have earned the respect of their peers,\nregardless of their position or role in the company. Because of that,\nassociates can grow their role tremendously without being promoted up the\nhierarchy, by simply continuing to build their own credibility and leadership\nbrand. Jan Wildeboer, a Red Hat veteran whose official title includes the word\n“evangelist,” is an example of a nondeveloper who is a key influencer.\nWildeboer, who is fond of wearing a red fedora (given to every new hire) just\nabout everywhere he goes, has substantial influence not just within Red Hat,\nbut also within the greater software community. His passion and energy for\nopen source earned him his title, which is a great gig if you can get it.\n\nRed Hat works to enable careers of achievement as well as careers of\nadvancement. In conventional organizations, though, it’s all about\nadvancement—how far you can climb the corporate ladder in order to gain the\nkind of power and influence you crave. But what often happens is that some of\nthe best people may not want to advance in that way. If you are a top software\ndeveloper, for example, the only way you can get promotions, raises, and\nincrease your influence in a conventional organization is to get promoted into\na management role, even if you happen to hate the idea of managing other\npeople and regardless of whether you are even good at it.\n\nThat notion is turned on its head in open organizations like Red Hat by\npromoting the idea that people can excel and achieve what they are best at and\nstill build influence, without necessarily having to do a job that they may\nnot like as much or be as good at doing. The people with the most influence in\nour organization are not necessarily those who hold fancy titles or have\npeople working for them.\n\nFor example, Wildeboer’s role—along with others like him, such as Michael\nTiemann, vice president of open source affairs—is really to serve as an\neducator about what open source software is, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux specifically, and how it can help transform everything we know about\nsoftware. These aren’t necessarily the roles these folks were hired for; more\noften, this kind of job is earned. The core open source programmers and\ndevelopers worldwide would never accept some charlatan or slick salesperson\nadvocating for their cause. Wildeboer and Tiemann earned their reputations and\ninfluence and, hence, have pivotal roles in steering the future of open\nsource. In this way, they also add immense value to Red Hat, helping build the\ncompany’s reputation in the open source community.\n\nIn the conventional organization, recognition and rewards are just another\ntop-down process that managers initiate. But at Red Hat, we have long\nappreciated the power of peer recognition to fuel meritocracy. For many years,\nthe Red Hat Reward Zone program has enabled associates to recognize and reward\npeers who go beyond what’s expected. Each quarter, regardless of rank or\nseniority, every Red Hatter—myself included—is granted an equal number of\npoints to use for rewarding fellow associates, who can redeem the points for\ngift cards and other merchandise. Sometimes we use Reward Zone awards to\nrecognize peers for extraordinary efforts, such as working late at night to\nhelp someone else find a solution for a customer. Associates also reward peers\nfor living our values and doing things the Red Hat way, such as inviting other\nteams to contribute their ideas and feedback on a project. One of the most\npopular reasons for giving and receiving a Red Hat Reward is collaboration—a\npowerful reminder of how essential that ingredient is to company culture.\n\nAnother example of how we work hard to recognize those Red Hatters who best\nexemplify company values and culture is the Chairman’s Award. Started several\nyears ago by former chairman and CEO Matthew Szulik as a way to drive a\nculture of peer recognition, the Chairman’s Award is the highest honor you can\nearn at Red Hat. It’s also very difficult to win, since you need to be\nnominated by at least two of your peers (not your manager). Only about\nseventeen people earn the honor each year. When someone wins, we celebrate by\ntreating him or her like an all-star at our annual Red Hat Summit and by\ncreating a video in which that person’s peers talk about all the reasons he or\nshe deserves the award. When you add all that up, it’s easy to recognize why\nit’s a powerful force that works from the bottom up and reinforces everything\nthe open organization is built on—connection, trust, transparency,\ncollaboration, and meritocracy.\n\nThe Leader’s Role: Empower Your Rock Stars to Follow Their Passions\n\nFreeing up the thought leaders and rock stars can jumpstart innovation,\nsomething every company and business is trying to bottle. Companies try many\nthings to drive innovation. One example is Google’s approach. Ever since\nGoogle became more of a household name starting around 2004, business leaders\nand thinkers have been digging to find out the company’s secret sauce in an\neffort to replicate its spectacular success. One of its best-known, though now\ndefunct, programs was one in which all Google employees were encouraged to\nspend 20 percent of their time on just about anything they wanted to. The\nidea, of course, is that by empowering employees to pursue projects and ideas\nthey are passionate about beyond the day-to-day duties of their real job,\nbreakthrough innovation will follow. The company can even tout how, before it\nended the program, successful side projects like Google Suggest, AdSense for\nContent, and Orkut all emerged from these 20 percent efforts—an impressive\nlist, to be sure.[9](index_split_019.html#filepos421192) I applaud Google for\ntaking such a far-reaching approach. Given Google’s phenomenal track record of\ninnovation, it’s no surprise that companies of all shapes and sizes have tried\nto duplicate this model in attempts to drive innovation throughout their\norganizations.\n\nAt Red Hat, however, we have taken a less structured approach. We don’t have\nany official policy for how much time each of our associates should spend\n“innovating.” Rather, when deciding how to allocate resources for trying new\nthings, we promote the idea that different people have earned different\ndegrees of latitude to spend their time innovating. Many people frankly get\nlittle or none, while others, at the extreme, may get 100 percent of their\ntime free to innovate. The most typical way is when someone works on a side\nproject (maybe on Red Hat’s time because they’ve been able to show their\nmanagers the value, or maybe on their own time until its value is evident),\nbut later grows it into a full-time gig.\n\nWe encourage this kind of approach for a specific reason: we want the people\nwho have proven to be great innovators to spend all of their time innovating,\nnot just 20 percent of it. For example, consider how one top developer, Gavin\nKing, essentially went off on his own, without any direction from above, to\ndevelop a new programming language called Ceylon. King, who joined Red Hat\nwhen his former employer, JBoss, was acquired in 2006, had grown frustrated\nwith the limitations of Java, a programming language released by Sun\nMicrosystems in 1995 that made it possible for internet software programs to\nrun on just about any kind of computer operating system. While Java remains\nextremely popular and useful, King saw a need to update its capabilities,\nespecially in developing new user interfaces. That’s exactly what he and a\ncommunity of other developers he recruited to help him accomplished. Ceylon is\njust one example of the innovative and game-changing products that have come\nfrom the R&D efforts of our top programmers. While we don’t know how\ncommercially successful Ceylon will be down the road, the key point is, as we\nlike to put it, we don’t sedate our rock stars.\n\nSimilarly, the associates at W. L. Gore also have the freedom to pursue\nprojects that match up with their skills and passion. As the authors of The\nGreat Workplace put it, “Gore associates have the freedom and the\nresponsibility to increase their contributions while building their expertise.\nWhile formal classes and performance discussions are held, associates are free\nto innovate in their career paths at Gore as much as they innovate in product\ndevelopment.”[10](index_split_019.html#filepos421629) According to Gary Hamel,\nat Gore, “the focus is on giving product champions time to experiment and\nlearn, and taking small risks rather than betting the ranch too early. It’s a\nway to organize for innovation, rather than plan for innovation, with a long-\nterm view.”[11](index_split_019.html#filepos421853)\n\nAt Red Hat, we encourage associates to work on what interests them and then\nwatch what happens when they put their energy and talent into their work,\nwhatever their role. “In any job, there are those projects that look like some\nsmall, boring things to check the box on,” says Rebecca Fernandez. “But at Red\nHat, there are so many opportunities for you to rethink those kinds of\nprojects and say, ‘No, this is bigger than what you’re suggesting, there’s an\nopportunity here to do something more valuable,’ and maybe take that project\nin an entirely different and better direction.” That kind of meritocratic\nfreedom to run with your ideas is where some of our best work happens, and is\nsome of the most gratifying.\n\nRather than impose a strategic or operational direction from above, Red Hat\nallows star associates to determine the best route forward. That helps explain\nwhy the adage, “Ask for forgiveness, not permission,” is often repeated,\nwhether it applies to an unofficial skunk works project or not.\n\nThe flip side of this approach would be a more democratic culture, where\neveryone is entitled to the same rights and opportunities. While this might\nsound good on paper, the results simply don’t add up. Given the competitive\nnature of our market, for instance, we as a company simply cannot afford to\nhave one-fifth of our associates’ time spent on efforts that might not have\nany positive return on that massive investment. Sure, we’d be successful now\nand again, assuming we had done our job in hiring talented and motivated\nindividuals. But we’ve found that it’s far more fruitful to let folks like\nGavin King do what they do best with their time—to run with many ideas even as\nthey do their regular work—and that’s something they earn by delivering great\nresults.\n\nThere are many great examples beyond the work Red Hat does on software. One is\nthe contact strategy and customer reference team, which works with our\ncustomers to provide everything from case studies and speakers at a user\nconference, to references, quotes, and testimonials for the media and sales\nprospects (among other contributions). The contact strategy and customer\nreference team evolved from an idea hatched by Red Hatter Kathryn Poole.\n\nA few years ago, Poole, who was working on the Red Hat public relations team,\nfound that she was fielding more and more requests from the sales team or the\nmedia to talk to customers. This was creating confusion for customers, who\nsometimes had multiple requests from different Red Hat associates to deal\nwith, and creating internal conflict among Red Hatters, who wanted to protect\nthose relationships.\n\nPoole saw an opportunity to simplify those dynamics. She suggested to her\nmanager at the time, Leigh Day, that she could create a new position for\nherself where she would serve both the company and the customers by becoming a\nliaison. “I thought it would be great to have a program that created a more\nformalized approach to how we dealt with our customers and made sure we\nhonored them for their contributions,” Poole told me. “We wanted to make them\nIT heroes.”\n\nIn the true spirit of the open organization, Day told Poole to go for it. She\nhas since grown the program to include three other full-time associates and\nbecome an integral component of how Red Hat interacts with customers\nworldwide. “One of the cool things about working for Red Hat is that we give\npeople enough leeway to go out and find your own role,” says Poole. “You get\nto design your own destiny. Nobody is going to create your career path for\nyou, which makes some people uncomfortable. But if you can prove that you’re\nproviding value, then people want to help you achieve success with it rather\nthan seeing it as some kind of a land grab.”\n\nExamples like this aren’t “nice to haves” at Red Hat. We rely on this type of\nself-direction as a key component of the management system. We use individual\ninitiative and freedom to replace many of the typical management processes\nthat would have identified this need, built the business case, justified it in\nthe planning and budget processes, and ultimately implemented it. Yes, we do\nsometimes create business cases and we certainly have a budgeting process, but\nthose are less onerous than is typical at companies of similar size and are\ndesigned to complement, not replace, the natural innovation coming from\nassociates.\n\nThis example also illustrates the important role that leaders play in this\nsystem. Managers help foster an environment where associates feel comfortable\nasking to build something new. They create the space for people to operate.\nThose are the traits that leaders must exhibit to successfully lead open\norganizations.\n\nOrganizing for Success\n\nYou might infer that managers are less important in a meritocracy than in a\nhierarchical organization because they make fewer direct decisions. Nothing\ncould be further from the truth. Our managers play a vital role in building,\nsupporting, and moderating the meritocracy. Finding that balance between\nsupporting it and, at the same time, leaving things alone is critical. To\nsupport the growth of a meritocracy, for example, you’ll need tools like memo-\nlist that give a voice to all employees, so they can begin to build influence\namong their peers. As a leader or manager, you’ll also need to keep your ears\nopen to not simply the loudest voices, but the ones that carry the most sway.\n\nWhat you don’t want to do, however, is try to squash the organic nature of how\nthe meritocracy might self-organize. All too often, companies, especially\nfast-growth or larger organizations, buy into the idea that they have to\nsystematize and sanitize their organizational culture to help gain control.\nBut, by doing so, they also begin to make excuses and create shortcuts for\ntheir underachievers—an idea that runs counter to everything a meritocracy\nstands for.\n\nAs the president and CEO of a fast-growing, publicly traded company, I\nunderstand the difficulty of this pull to control things. I’ve realized though\nthat I have had to establish my own reputation as well, which has pushed me to\nbe a better listener and leader. I know that I don’t have all the answers for\nwhere the company or its technology needs to head into the future. But I also\nknow that I will do my best to empower the most innovative associates to help\nme map that road ahead. Again, it’s not always a neat, pretty, or efficient\nprocess, but it works.\n\nWhile we’ve taken the notion of a meritocracy to an extreme at Red Hat, it’s\nnot rocket science. Any leader at any company can improve his or her\norganization’s performance by simply engaging the thermostats. Most people\nknow who the thought leaders are. Ask around your own organization, and just\nabout anyone can tell you who the thermostats are. The key for you as a leader\nand an organization, however, is to think about how to best use these people,\nregardless of their role in the company, to help drive innovation forward.\nSometimes that can mean creating a physical atmosphere to promote that kind of\nmind-set.\n\nFor example, the financial services firm Edward Jones, which has more than\neleven thousand locations and some 7 million clients, ditched its system of\nformal job descriptions in favor of what it calls “responsibility statements”\nthat the company’s associates write themselves. The associates define their\nown jobs. While I think some readers might be saying that’s akin to turning\nthe zoo over to the animals, it’s actually an effective strategy in which the\nassociates define their goals and how to measure the results they will attain\nto reach those goals. It’s not about describing daily activities as much as\ngiving the associates control over their own career paths. “We don’t tell\nassociates exactly what they have to do, when they have to do it, or how they\nhave to do it,” said Jim Weddle, the firm’s managing partner. “With\nresponsibility-based management, decisions are made by the people who are the\nexperts because they are the ones doing the work. It makes us more nimble,\nmore able to make good decisions quickly. We take more satisfaction for our\nwork because we’ve assumed responsibility for\nit.”[12](index_split_019.html#filepos422009)\n\nSimilarly, I recently spoke with a senior executive at a large insurance\ncompany. In order to foster innovation, he had selected teams to innovate on\nspecific areas of the business. One team member he chose was a security guard\nat one of the company’s facilities. While he might seem an odd choice, that\nsecurity guard is one of the company’s largest patent holders. Thermostats are\neverywhere in your organization: ignore them at your peril.\n\nThe Path to Earning Respect as a Leader\n\nHow would you be perceived in your own organization’s meritocracy? Ask\nyourself if you command respect because people have to respect you or, rather,\nbecause you’ve truly earned respect. Many people aspire to titles because that\nforces others to respect them. But, to me, this is the lowest form of respect,\nespecially if the person you’re receiving respect from is more junior than you\nor works at a lower rung in the bureaucracy. Respect has to be earned. It’s\nnot about a title.\n\nWhen people respect you only because of your authority, they will give you the\nminimum effort. Some incredibly brilliant people have earned respect because\nthey are so smart, but most people aren’t incredibly brilliant. So how do you\ngo about it? There are three ways:\n\n  1. Show passion for the purpose of your organization and constantly drive interest in it. People are drawn to and generally want to follow passionate people. At Red Hat, that means being passionate about open source.\n  2. Demonstrate confidence. Many people in positions of authority don’t show confidence well, especially with their team. It’s one thing to convey confidence to your own boss, but it’s just as important to share that same confidence with those who report to you.\n  3. Engage your people. Trust has to be earned, and it’s not enough to call a meeting and tell people what to do and then retreat behind your own closed door. You also need to be open about your weaknesses and ask the team to help you address them. Nobody expects perfection, so don’t hold your cards too close; get your team to work with you.\n\nAs a leader, it’s so easy to surround yourself with people who think exactly\nthe same way that you do, or at least who tell you what you want to hear.\nThose people are everywhere, and they’re often the first to speak up. But if\nyou really want to learn, seek out those people who present a divergent\nviewpoint and who will tell you what you need to hear, even when it’s not\neasy.\n\nCertainly, joining Red Hat posed a challenge for me. While I had a degree in\ncomputer science, I had no background in enterprise IT. In a very open,\ninteractive culture like Red Hat’s, there was no way for me to fake it.\nHowever, I found that being very open about the things I did not know actually\nhad the opposite effect than I would have thought. It helped me build\ncredibility. My team learned that I wouldn’t feign knowledge where I did not\nhave it and therefore was more likely to give me the benefit of the doubt when\nI did talk confidently. No one expects leaders to know everything all the\ntime, but we do expect our leaders to be truthful and forthright.\n\nStill a Work in Progress\n\nAt Red Hat, one of the greatest insults or blows to your ego comes when you\nput something on one of the internal discussion threads and receive nothing\nback—neither positive nor negative. “That’s the worst outcome, truly,” Kim\nJokisch, director of Red Hat’s employment branding and communications team,\ntold me. “That means they’re likely ignoring it, which means you’ve failed in\nsome way.”\n\nEven so, the goal is not simply to generate posts and responses. That’s not\nwhat builds your credibility. Rather, it’s all about your true purpose.\n“People smell out intention around here,” says Emily Stancil Martinez, a\nmember of Red Hat’s corporate communications team. “If your intention is just\nto stick your nose into every little thing so you can be front and center,\npeople see it and will take note. But if you are thoughtful when you weigh in,\nin order to make a real contribution for the greater good, that’s what truly\nbuilds your credibility and raises your profile.”\n\nBut having the patience to build up that level of credibility can be\nfrustrating to someone who joins the team. A new hire—especially someone who\nhasn’t already built a reputation in the open source community—simply won’t\nhave the same level of influence as, say, Máirín Duffy or Thomas Cameron. It\ndoesn’t always seem fair, and some good ideas are likely never heard as a\nresult. An enthusiastic new hire may join the company with the thought that\nhis ideas will be heard equally, only to fall into a rut when he feels as if\nhis good ideas are ignored. That can quickly lead to a disengaged employee who\neither leaves the company or, worse, becomes a cultural naysayer. Part of the\nsolution is to set expectations so people know that earning a reputation takes\ntime and hard work. It’s as if you want to sell something on a site like eBay:\nwithout any history or reputation score, you can find it far harder to locate\nbuyers interested in what you’re selling. That takes time, patience, and a\ncommitment to working at building your reputation, which isn’t something\neveryone enjoys doing. The upside of this kind of culture far outweighs any\ndownside. The system is a work in progress, but is still a system that is\nlight years ahead of the conventional organization approach.\n\nJim’s Leadership Tips\n\n> 1.Don’t use phrases like “the boss wants it this way” or rely on\n> hierarchical name dropping. While that may get things done in the short\n> term, it can curtail discussion that’s core to building a meritocracy.\n\n> 2.Publicly recognize a great effort or contribution.

I had a phone meeting with Paul Cormier, Red Hat’s\npresident of products and technologies. Cormier and I discussed a variety of\nissues, as we always do, and then eventually wrapped up our talk. My wife, who\nwas at home during the call, came over and asked, “Oh my gosh, what’s wrong?\nIt sounds like you just had a huge fight!” This caught me by surprise. I said,\n“No, we didn’t. We were just debating something and trying to find a\nsolution.”\n\nWhat I realized then was that many of our discussions at Red Hat involve\nheated and passionate debate, something that rarely happened in my earlier\njobs. Certainly, most interactions are not as heated as my discussion with\nCormier was that day—he and I have developed our own norms over the years—but\nRed Hat associates’ passion for the business and comfort with speaking our\nminds make the average interaction much more frank than I’ve seen at\nconventional organizations. In my experience, if someone disagreed with\nsomething you said in a meeting, he would rarely confront you about it, and\ncertainly not in Red Hat’s open and unvarnished way, especially to dare\nquestioning someone higher up on the corporate hierarchy.\n\nLuckily, I started my career in what I would characterize as an intellectual\nmeritocracy. At BCG, a professional services firm with many bright, motivated\npeople where the product was our thoughts and ideas, we had many spirited,\nfree-flowing debates. While the partners were clearly in charge, there was a\ndeep cultural ethos of seeking truth and give-and-take. Case teams at BCG were\nencouraged to have healthy debates, which often lasted late into the night. I\nloved it. But I also knew that when I left to join the corporate world, I\nwould have to leave this behind. That type of debate is rare across levels in\na conventional organization.\n\nWhen I got to Red Hat, though, I quickly learned that you can’t get the best\ncreativity, initiative, or effort from the members of an open organization by\nsaying, “Go do this.” The best ideas happen when teams hash things out.\nEngineers at Red Hat have publicly challenged my decisions. That would never\nhave happened at Delta. These challenges are typically quite respectful and\nwell thought out, and rarely cross the line. But public, open disagreement is\npart of how Red Hat works; I’m convinced that we get better answers as a\nresult. I love working, debating, and sometimes arguing with people to solve\nhard, complex issues. I love to argue—not maliciously—but in a healthy way in\nwhich both sides are heard. I love to stir up a good debate and sometimes\nthink of myself as Red Hat’s head debater. When you start a conversation,\nyou’re more likely to find better solutions. I didn’t bring this component of\nour culture to Red Hat; it was already there, but I do feel right at home with\nit. As the legendary management guru Peter Drucker so aptly put it, “The only\nway to discover your strengths is through feedback\nanalysis.”[1](index_split_019.html#filepos422349)\n\nAt Red Hat, even our values—freedom, courage, commitment, and\naccountability—intentionally create a degree of tension (see figure 5-1).\nThese four values, which the company chose in 2002, well before I joined the\nteam in 2008, still resonate with everything we do today. This is true in\nlarge part because they weren’t handed down from executives after returning\nfrom a weekend retreat. Red Hatters themselves chose them and have since\nembedded them into the fabric of the corporate culture. And those values\nrequire thought. Most companies’ values are decidedly noncontroversial. Our\nvalues, on the other hand, address our aspirations—what we believe in. And we\naccept that those things can, at times, be in conflict. They therefore require\nconstant balance.\n\nFigure 5-1\n\nRed Hat’s four values\n\n![](images/00001.jpg)\n\nOur values, usually represented as balls on a scale to show that balance, also\nillustrate how the debates in a highly collaborative culture can, in fact, be\nquite productive, despite “letting the sparks fly.” Think about how freedom,\nfor example, can directly oppose accountability or commitment. People might\nask, if freedom is a value, what’s to stop someone from declaring he has the\nfreedom to not show up for work? But freedom is balanced out by another\nvalue—accountability. People do have a great deal of freedom at Red Hat, but\nwhen we are at our best, this freedom is kept in check by accountability—to\neach other, to our partners and customers, and to our shareholders.\n\nAs an organization, we’re like a ship that rights itself when we lean too\nheavily in the direction of any one of the four values. People who naturally\ngravitate toward freedom or courage don’t find it easy to work with those who\nlean more heavily toward accountability or commitment. That inherent tension\nand conflict between our values is part of why they’re so compelling to our\nassociates. Red Hatters continually experience this push and pull within the\ncompany. The willingness to address tension is built deep into our corporate\nDNA.\n\nAt Red Hat, solving problems head-on is a big part of the culture. We’re in\nthe business of working with communities, customers, and partners to solve\ncomplex IT challenges (think of the cloud and big data). While we don’t\nnecessarily argue for argument’s sake, we can be really passionate about\ngetting things right. Many see a highly collaborative culture as a supportive,\npositive environment where people encourage each other with positive\nreinforcement. Actually, Red Hat is anything but that. It is very supportive\nand collaborative, but in a very different way. We debate, we argue, and we\ncomplain. In many ways, it can seem harsh. But iron sharpens iron, and we’ve\ncome to embrace the notion of letting the sparks fly.\n\nBeyond Brainstorming\n\nWhen people envision what good collaboration looks like, most picture classic\nbrainstorming techniques in which positive reinforcement is used to encourage\nparticipation. Brainstorming was originally conceived by famed ad man Alex\nOsborn, founder of the advertising agency BBDO; the idea behind it was to use\npositive reinforcement and feedback to stimulate people’s creativity—“there is\nno such thing as a bad idea”—a technique that has been widely employed since\nOsborn laid out the ground rules in his 1948 book, Your Creative Power.\n\nOsborn’s technique has been challenged in recent years. For instance, in a\n2003 study, Charlan Nemeth, a professor of psychology at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, found that emphasizing the “debate condition,” in which\npeople are encouraged to challenge and debate each other’s ideas, actually\ngenerates substantially more new ideas than Osborn’s approach. As recounted in\na New Yorker article titled, “Groupthink: The Brainstorming Myth,” Nemeth\nsaid:\n\n> > While the instruction “Do not criticize” is often cited as the important\n> instruction in brainstorming, this appears to be a counterproductive\n> strategy. Our findings show that debate and criticism do not inhibit ideas\n> but, rather, stimulate them relative to every other condition … There’s this\n> Pollyannaish notion that the most important thing to do when working\n> together is stay positive and get along, to not hurt anyone’s feelings.\n> Well, that’s just wrong. Maybe debate is going to be less pleasant, but it\n> will always be more productive. True creativity requires some trade-\n> offs.[2](index_split_019.html#filepos422780)\n\nSimilarly, in his book, 59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot, psychologist\nRichard Wiseman reached the conclusion that simply gathering a group of people\ntogether does not ensure that they’ll reach creative conclusions. He writes:\n“When strong-willed people lead group discussion, they can pressure others\ninto conforming, can encourage self-censorship, and can create an illusion of\nunanimity. Two heads are not necessarily better than one. More than fifty\nyears of research suggest that irrational thinking occurs when people try to\nreach decisions in groups, and this can lead to a polarization of opinions and\na highly biased assessment of a\nsituation.”[3](index_split_019.html#filepos423071)\n\nOne term we often hear is groupthink, coined by William H. Whyte, author of\nThe Organization Man, in a 1952 issue of Fortune. The idea is that when a\ngroup of people work together, they tend to want to reach some kind of harmony\nand to minimize conflict, which so often leads to terrible and even tragic\nresults. James Surowiecki tackles this subject in his now famous book, The\nWisdom of Crowds, in which he discusses the research done by the Yale\nUniversity psychologist Irving Janis to understand how groupthink was\nresponsible for the poor decision making leading up to events like the attack\non Pearl Harbor and the Bay of Pigs invasion. Surowiecki writes: “Homogeneous\ngroups become more cohesive more easily than diverse groups, and as they\nbecome more cohesive they become more dependent on the group, more isolated\nfrom outside opinions, and therefore more convinced that the group’s judgment\non important issues must be right. These kinds of groups, Janis suggested,\nshare an illusion of invulnerability, a willingness to rationalize away\ncounterarguments to the group’s position, and a conviction that dissent is not\nuseful.”[4](index_split_019.html#filepos423373) In other words, there’s almost\na constant bias for us to go along with the will of the crowd—to please others\nand fit in, regardless of whether we truly agree with the consensus.\n\nThat’s where the power of what the authors of Collective Genius call “creative\nabrasion,” which they define as something that involves some level of\nconflict—a disagreement, contention, or argument—that works best when it’s\npracticed within a community that has a shared purpose, shared values, and\nrules of engagement that help keep the conflict productive rather than\ndestructive.[5](index_split_019.html#filepos423643) The film studio Pixar is a\nbig believer in the power of such creative abrasion, and its executives credit\nopen debates within the ranks of their creative people for pushing the\nboundaries of what was possible for animated movies such as Toy Story, A Bug’s\nLife, Cars, and Up. “There is no doubt that our decision-making is better if\nwe are able to draw on the collective knowledge and unvarnished opinions of\nthe group,” said Ed Catmull, one of Pixar’s cofounders, who strongly believes\nin the value of “candor”—meaning forthrightness or frankness—when working\nthrough opportunities and challenges. Pixar has even created an organizational\ngroup called the “Brain Trust” whose function is to get candid feedback on\nwhatever movies the studio happens to be working on. “A hallmark of a healthy\ncreative culture is that its people feel free to share ideas, opinions, and\ncriticisms,” Catmull said. “Lack of candor, if unchecked, ultimately leads to\ndysfunctional environments.”[6](index_split_019.html#filepos423881)\n\nSimilarly, John Seely Brown, the former head of Xerox PARC, once said,\n“Breakthroughs often appear in the white space between crafts. These crafts\nstart to collide, and in that collision radically new things start to\nhappen.”[7](index_split_019.html#filepos424190) Bill Coughran, a former senior\nvice president of engineering, infrastructure group at Google, was quoted as\nsaying: “Managing tensions in the organization is an ongoing issue … You don’t\nwant an organization that just salutes and does what you say. You want an\norganization that argues with you. And so you want to nurture the bottoms up,\nbut you’ve got to be careful that you don’t degenerate into\nchaos.”[8](index_split_019.html#filepos424428)\n\nAn interesting characteristic of open source software communities is that, as\na whole, they tend to embrace the approach championed by Nemeth and others who\nsee the value in stirring the pot and dissenting from the crowd. Online forums\nand chat rooms are often filled with spirited and sometimes caustic back-and-\nforth debates about everything from how best to fix a software bug to what new\nfeatures to consider in a subsequent release. Usually, there is a first phase\nof discussions in which new ideas are posited and collected, but there is\nalways a subsequent round of critical analysis. While anyone may have the\nability to wade into these debates, in doing so, they should be prepared to\ndefend their position with every ounce of their ability. Unpopular ideas will\nbe, at best, shot down and, at worst, ridiculed.\n\nFor example, even Linus Torvalds, founder of the Linux operating system,\nvoices his disagreement with proposed changes to the code on message boards.\nIn one case, he and David Howells, one of Red Hat’s lead developers, got into\na heated discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List about the merit of a\nchange in the code Red Hat was asking for, which would help our clients with\nsecurity. In response to a request from Howells, Torvalds wrote back:\n\n> > Quite frankly, this is [bleeping] moronic.

And this\n> makes the idiotic complicated interfaces, and now it goes up to 11.\n> Linus[9](index_split_019.html#filepos424589)\n\nTechnical details aside, Torvalds went on to say a few more choice things in a\nsubsequent note that I won’t get into here. That conversation got so loud that\neven the Wall Street Journal covered it. “An argument between software\nengineers working for open source distributor Red Hat Inc. and Linux founder\nLinus Torvalds embodies the tension between pragmatists and idealists that\nexists in almost every business, and underlies many decisions made not only in\nbuilding software, but involving just about any product that’s brought to\nmarket,” wrote Michael Hickins in an article with the headline: “Linux Throw-\nDown Sheds Light on ‘Moronic’ Software\nProcesses.”[10](index_split_019.html#filepos424830)\n\nHickins frames the argument by showing how, in most proprietary software\ncompanies, there is no public debate about what new features or changes the\ncompany might be working on. When the product is ready, the company simply\nships it out to customers and moves on. With Linux, however, there is an\nalmost constant debate about what changes might be needed and—most\nimportantly—why they’re needed. That, of course, makes the whole process a lot\nmessier and more time consuming. As Hickins writes: “Keeping those arguments\nbehind closed doors allows vendors of proprietary software to ship products\nmore quickly than purists might like, even if it means having to patch or\nupgrade the software later. Hashing out arguments out in the open helps ensure\nsoftware purists have their say and, in many cases, their\nway.”[11](index_split_019.html#filepos425127)\n\nMy point is that this is the culture that Red Hat has grown out of. At the\nbeginning, the company was really just a bunch of developers and hackers who\nembraced the whole idea of working in the spirit of open source. That meant\nengaging in heated debates about, well, just about everything. But as the\ncompany has grown, it has become much more than just a group of coders. People\nwork in everything from marketing and human resources to finance. Yet, as\nwe’ve grown up, we’ve kept that spirit of collaboration and debate alive so\nthat it affects just about every decision we make as a company.\n\nI am certainly not advocating that the Linux community’s brash style is\ngenerally appropriate. It has taken the model to an extreme. In fact, Red Hat\nactively works to ensure that open source communities welcome diverse people\nand thoughts. We need to navigate a tightrope between providing honest and\nunvarnished feedback without crossing the line to be offensive. Most people\nare naturally nice. We would much rather compliment than criticize. Others\neven avoid conflict. But a key theme throughout this book is that leaders must\noften foster and encourage debate. If you don’t debate things and solicit\nfeedback, that’s a problem. If you like top-down order and structure in\ndiscussions, the kind of chaotic culture we have built at Red Hat won’t appeal\nto you.\n\nIt takes time to get used to our open, frank style of debate. But for some of\nour developers—in particular, those who have spent years in their open source\ncommunities—we’ve actually had to work to find a compromise. We’ve learned to\nembrace the phrase, “You aren’t your code,” which is used in the open source\nworld to emphasize that just because someone is criticizing what you’ve done,\nit doesn’t mean they are criticizing you personally. We have worked hard so\npeople don’t let their feelings get hurt when someone disagrees with their\nidea; those are two separate things. They need to be able to remove themselves\nfrom their work to look at it objectively. But it’s a work in progress. We\nwant to make sure that we keep our edge without alienating others who join our\nmission.\n\nAdopting a New Mind-Set\n\nDuring Delta’s bankruptcy restructuring, I worked with a number of people\nwhose full-time jobs are to help distressed companies. These bankers and\nlawyers specialize in bankruptcies and out of court debt restructurings. I\nlearned that they often use the expression “terminally nice” to describe\nclients. They often see companies with cultures that avoid conflict, so they\nnever have frank, unpleasant conversations that are needed. These companies\nend up in real trouble because the cultures never initiate the difficult\nconversations that drive superior performance.\n\nEveryone knows the expression “the elephant in the room” (or some variant of\nit). In other words, everyone knows what the real issue is, but no one wants\nto raise and discuss it, because it’s personally painful and full of conflict.\nOne of the biggest threats any executive faces is the notion that he or she is\nonly hearing the good stuff about the business. People generally want to\nplease, so it can be a challenge to encourage them to deliver the bad along\nwith the good. Open organizations adopt an open mind-set so they can encourage\neveryone to speak up and share insights. While most companies fortunately\ndon’t reach the point of being “terminally nice,” many never reach their full\npotential because they don’t address the hard issues. In most conventional\norganizations, the biggest clue that there is disagreement among the team is\nthat nobody says anything at all. That’s why encouraging dissenting opinions\nis so critical to success in making the culture in an open organization come\ntogether.\n\nThe team at W. L. Gore apparently agrees with this as well. The company’s CEO,\nTerri Kelly, has said that a big part of her job is getting out and talking to\nher associates in person, sometimes as many as a hundred to two hundred at a\ntime. As part of those town hall–style talks, Kelly encourages her team to\ntell her how to truly stoke two-way communications throughout the\norganization. As one associate says, it’s an important part of their culture:\n“I can sit in a room with Terri Kelly and really battle out a difference of\nopinion and feel no fear of repercussion as a result of that kind of behavior.\nIn fact, it’s the expected behavior. We have the opportunity to connect\nwhenever we need to connect to take on whatever might be the issue or the\nopportunity of the day.”[12](index_split_019.html#filepos425254)\n\nAt Red Hat meetings, people might actually go out of their way to argue a\npoint. Our meetings have more words spoken per minute than in any other\ncompany out there, not because people are trying to be difficult, but because\nthey are so passionate. They like to push the discussion further than it might\ngo to take another side of the argument.\n\nFor example, soon after I joined Red Hat, we made a very important (and\nstrategic) technology decision in our virtualization business when we\npurchased Qumranet—a story I told in [chapter\n3](index_split_010.html#filepos124058). In the same spirit of trying to build\nengagement from the beginning, a number of our top technical people\nparticipated in an evaluation process to help us make the best possible choice\nwhen we made that acquisition.\n\nBut even after we made our decision, one of the engineers called me out in\nfront of the group—which included his boss, his boss’s boss, and more—letting\nme know that he thought we were making the wrong choice. He also went to great\nlengths to explain why. While I thanked him for his input—he did make many\nvalid arguments—I continued to believe we were on the right path. Meanwhile,\nas he was talking, I kept looking at his boss and his boss’s boss to see how\nthey were reacting to this engineer speaking up as he was. This kind of thing\nnever happened at Delta. If it had, people would have been turning purple with\nrage. An unwritten workplace rule was you didn’t call out your boss—let alone\nyour boss’s boss—in front of their boss. The whole scene only added to my\nsense that this company was chaotic.\n\nBut that engineer’s words never left me. It also soon became clear that he was\nright—the decision we made just wasn’t the best one for Red Hat. So we made a\nmajor about-face when it came to the technology. It was costly and time\nconsuming, but it was the better decision. I share this story not to be\ncavalier about the significant financial investments we made. Rather, I’d like\nto stress that I couldn’t let my ego—or the fact that we had been wrong—get in\nthe way of making the best possible decisions for the company. Building an\nopen organization with a participatory culture like Red Hat’s is all about\nencouraging debate and celebrating the best ideas, regardless of who or where\nthey come from. It’s not an easy thing to do, but it’s the right thing if you\nwant to build a more engaged, collaborative, and innovative workforce.\n\nWhat can seem harsh at times is that no matter what you bring up, you can\nexpect someone to challenge you. The beauty of this approach is that you will\nalways have multiple views from different people to use as you form your own\nopinions. If, by contrast, the goal is for everyone in a meeting to be nice to\neach other and every idea is treated as a good one, you can end up with\nresults nobody is pleased with. A famous quote from Sir Alec Issigonis frames\nit: “A camel is a horse designed by committee.” In other words, when you try\nto please everyone, you often wind up incorporating elements that nobody wants\nor needs. When you weave healthy debate and honesty into a conversation,\nthough, your results can be fundamentally different.\n\nFor instance, when I go on sales calls with reps from Red Hat and ask them,\n“How are things?” I rarely get a response like, “Everything is fine.” What I\nhear instead is a litany of issues about what the reps think we could be doing\nbetter or what problems they are facing and what they think they need to do in\norder to overcome them. They unload on me. That’s the kind of interaction that\nis the opposite of being terminally nice, and it means I’m hearing what’s\nreally going on in the business. While it would certainly be easier to hear\n“everything is great,” I know ultimately we perform better as a company\nbecause we don’t take the easy way out.\n\nGoogle relies on something called “Google Ideas,” a web-based forum where\nemployees regularly submit ideas on everything from product improvements to\nmaking the company a better place to work. The rest of the Google team can\nthen weigh in with opinions on those ideas using a zero- to five-point scale.\nGoogle’s management team pays close attention to the activity on the ideas\nsite to see which ones are trending and should perhaps be escalated to other\ncommunication levels in the company, say, by including it in a companywide\ne-mail discussion. What makes this kind of forum so valuable is that every\nemployee at Google has a way to collect feedback—both objective and admittedly\nsubjective—from peers with the ultimate goal of having the best ideas bubble\nup to the top.[13](index_split_019.html#filepos425471)\n\nAt Red Hat, as I mentioned earlier, we rely heavily on forums like memo-list\nto facilitate conversations on everything from opinions on new technology to\ndiscussing the latest scuttlebutt on our competitors. To make our system of\nletting the sparks fly work, though, as a leader in the organization, I can’t\nmoderate such discussions by deleting or reprimanding or setting rules. That\nwould squash the conversation. I encourage people to constructively criticize,\nbecause most people won’t. Now and then, there’s a post that says something\nobnoxious, but those get quickly shouted down. The real problem is getting\npeople who are genuinely nice to say something that might be harsh. I have to\nask people, “What did you mean by that?” Sometimes people on a mailing list\nmight say an idea is stupid, even pointing out everything that’s wrong with\none of my ideas. But that’s OK. It’s how you get to the best ideas, and it\nfrees your organization from the dangers of terminal niceness.\n\nFor example, Vineet Nayar, the CEO who helped lead a dramatic turnaround at\nHCL Technologies, an information technology consulting company based in India,\nstarted an internal blog he calls “My Problems,” in which he posts the\nstrategic problems he’s working on to collect feedback and ideas from anyone\nin the company willing to share thoughts. As the authors of Conscious\nCapitalism write, this forum gives Nayar “access to a huge amount of fresh\nthinking about such questions, and it also encourages more people to think\nmore broadly and strategically about the\nbusiness.”[14](index_split_019.html#filepos425603)\n\nThe key is to strive to find the balance between shutting down debate when\nposts become caustic, while also continuing to push people to give you the\nkind of frank feedback you’re looking for. This is where we rely heavily on\nour culture of 360-degree accountability and peer-to-peer management. The\nworst thing we could do as an organization is make it seem as if the CEO and\nmanagement team are somehow trying to shut people up, even if they might be\nout of line. The job for the crowd is to help self-police our e-mail lists. At\nthe same time, we have to encourage people to participate, but we can’t then\nsay every idea is great. That’s what can be difficult for some people to adapt\nto.\n\nGrowing a Thick Skin\n\nThe feedback from sharing new ideas at Red Hat can sometimes feel blunt and\nbrutally honest, regardless of who originated the idea. “People are passionate\nabout the company and what we do,” Máirín Duffy, a user-interface designer,\ntold me. “When people interpret something as going against the company’s core\nvalues, they feel threatened, and that is when the sparks really fly.” That\nmeans that memo-list can be a somewhat dangerous place if Red Hatters don’t\ntake the time to think before they write. To work in such an environment,\ntherefore, people need a pretty thick skin. Given that the back-and-forth can\nbe challenging, many newcomers to the company are left to wonder, “You call\nthis collaboration?” This approach to generating and sharing new ideas may be\ndifficult—it certainly requires lots of effort—but it works. And that’s why we\nmake letting the sparks fly such a clear component of our corporate culture,\nwhile also recognizing that it takes some time to adjust to.\n\nFor example, Kim Jokisch, director of Red Hat’s employment branding team, left\na job at The Body Shop to join Red Hat back in 2002. The Body Shop, founded by\nAnita Roddick, was one of the pioneering companies in creating natural\ncosmetic products. It was, as Jokisch puts it, a “good news kind of business,”\nand the people who worked there felt as if they were making a difference in\nthe world. But it was still a conventional organization. When Jokisch got to\nRed Hat, she felt the difference in culture immediately. While there was a\nsimilar passion for making the world a better place, there was also an edge\nshe wasn’t used to, something that was driven home when she began rolling out\nnew programs such as a performance management system and a more formalized\napproach to interviewing candidates.\n\n“We were starting to hire a lot more people, and we needed to formalize our\nprocesses,” Jokisch told me. “We wanted to institute behavioral-based systems,\nrather than something that was more ad hoc. So, I researched the best programs\nwe could put in place, got certified, and then traveled around the globe,\ntraining our managers and people on how to use them.”\n\nThat’s just about when the sparks began to fly. “I was really surprised by the\namount of pushback I got, where people all over the company said things like,\n‘This will take too much time,’ or ‘What do you mean I can’t ask that?’” said\nJokisch, who had been doing such training for about ten years before she got\nto Red Hat. “I began thinking, ‘What have I done? I left this great job where\nthere was always positive feedback on everything you did. Now I am being\nchallenged every step of the way. It often felt like I had to justify\neverything I did.”\n\nTo her credit, Jokisch recognized that feedback of any kind should be\nconsidered a gift, even if it’s painful at first. She realized that she needed\nto engage people in the process and collaborate to find the best solution,\nrather than going off on her own and forcing a particular solution.\n\nThe open communication channels at Red Hat can sometimes seem like, according\nto one Red Hatter, “a pool full of piranhas.” But the sharing of feelings and\nopinions is ultimately a positive thing because it reinforces that anyone can\nhave a say, which leads to increased engagement. “What I quickly realized was\nthat even harsh feedback makes you smarter and better at your job because it\nhelps you think of things from different angles,” Jokisch told me. “To be\nsuccessful, then, you really have to check your ego at the door and recognize\nthat there are a lot of other smart people working here and that by getting\ntheir feedback and point of view, you’re going to be better at what you do.”\n\nWhile developing a thick skin is a prerequisite for success at Red Hat,\neveryone also needs to recognize, respect, and have flexibility in\nunderstanding and engaging with the different cultures within the company. As\nthings have changed over time, not all areas of the company are the same. The\nengineers, for example, who work more closely with open source communities,\ntend to be much harsher in sharing their feedback than are other teams. We’ve\ndiscussed internally how best to handle those kinds of differences and\nconcluded that we don’t want to have a single overriding culture. It can be OK\nto have differences in cultural areas as long as everyone believes we are all\nworking for better outcomes throughout the organization. People have different\npersonalities and priorities; they think and speak out in different ways.\nThese differences can make letting the sparks fly even more challenging. But\nyou don’t want to strip away differences in trying to get to consensus,\nbecause that can lead to groupthink, poor decisions, and stalled innovation.\nPeople must be encouraged to speak up, in their own distinct ways, and\nrewarded when they do.\n\n“It’s not just debate though—it’s action, too,” Duffy told me. “Talk without\naction isn’t regarded very highly. For example, if you complain about a piece\nof software we make not doing something you think it should, you’re going to\nbe regarded as noise unless you step up and actually write some code to\nprototype the idea. Or, if you complain that the company uses some piece of\nsoftware that isn’t good, you better back up your complaint with some\nsuggestions for better things, or you will be regarded as just adding noise.”\n\nThe Leader’s Role: Knocking Down Barriers to Collaboration\n\nTechnology companies are known for casual dress. You can walk the streets of\nPalo Alto past the cafés and restaurants for hours and never see a tie. But\nmany of the same technology companies that employ these folks have rigid\nhierarchies that would match anything a military academy can muster. Steve\nJobs dressed casually, but there was no question who was in charge at Apple.\nAt Red Hat, we embrace informality in myriad ways, not because we like to be\ncomfortable in what we wear or that we wouldn’t like couches in the executive\nsuite, but because we’ve learned that to truly encourage dialogue and debate\nacross the company, we have to break down any semblance of an “us and them”\nculture.\n\nIn conventional hierarchical organizations, the trappings of power can\nactually play a constructive role. They are visual cues for people’s positions\nin the organization. Since decision rights correlate to level, having visible\nways to show differences in position can be helpful. When I worked at Delta,\nwearing a suit and tie was a measure of rank in the corporate hierarchy. As\nsoon as you were promoted to vice president, you received a sticker for your\ncar that corresponded with your own personal parking space with your name on\nit. Every day when I drove in, the guards at the gate would salute me and call\nme “sir.”\n\nThat helps explain why it took me a few months working at Red Hat before I\nnoticed that I looked different from everyone, that the button-down shirt and\npressed khakis I wore somehow set me apart, just as a suit and tie did at\nDelta. I was creating an invisible hierarchy without realizing it. The very\nnext day, I came in wearing jeans and a casual shirt. It finally dawned on me\nthat formality and visual cues could become barriers to collaboration. What I\nlearned was that the people at Red Hat express themselves through their\npersonalities, not their clothes or their rank. There are plenty of fancy cars\nin the Red Hat parking lot, but no one has an assigned space. Our associates\nrecognize that promotions are more about validation of their value and hard\nwork, not parking spaces and corner offices.\n\nSomething as simple as a T-shirt can break down barriers at Red Hat. Early on\nin my experience at Red Hat, my wife and kids were still living in Atlanta, so\nI was commuting back and forth on the weekends until we settled in Raleigh.\nFUDCon, the Fedora Users and Developers Conference, a major open source\nsoftware event, was being held on Saturday at the end of my first week. Kim\nJokisch suggested that I stay the weekend so I could attend, since it would be\na chance for me to connect with Red Hatters who had assembled for the event\nfrom all over. While I was clearly looking forward to seeing my family, I\nthought it was a great idea. I asked if I could get a Fedora T-shirt to wear\nto the event. The last thing I wanted was to show up looking like the typical\ncorporate executive on a casual Friday. I didn’t really have a grand motive\nfor wearing the T-shirt. I just wanted to blend in. It took people a while to\nrealize that this guy walking around in the Fedora T-shirt was the new CEO of\nRed Hat. I was surprised that people actually noticed. I heard about it\nseveral times in the weeks and months that followed and was later told that\nwearing the T-shirt bought me some added geek cred. The little symbolic things\ncan truly make a real difference.\n\nHow we dress seems like a little thing, and many companies have adopted\n“business casual” policies. But to truly break down the barriers and get ideas\nfreely flowing, things like how you dress need to reflect and reinforce your\nculture, not be at odds with it. The lesson, therefore, is about not just\ngoing through the motions but truly working to break down barriers. In other\nwords, it’s not really about the clothes.\n\nSimilarly, when I look back at my interview at Red Hat, which I talked about\nin [chapter 1](index_split_007.html#filepos23202), when I wondered why I was\nthe only one with cash in my wallet, I now realize that it never occurred to\nMatthew Szulik or Michael Cunningham to treat me any other way or to evaluate\nme based on my clothes. I wasn’t special or privileged just because of my\nbackground or the job I was interviewing for (I would later learn that Szulik\nran more than a few other recruits through a similar gauntlet). It was simply\npart of the company’s culture in which meritocracy, not hierarchy, reigns\nsupreme. If you like the accoutrements of power, Red Hat is most certainly not\nfor you.\n\nBreaking down hierarchies also includes removing all the forms of special\ntreatments today’s executives seem so entitled to, including titles. People at\nRed Hat care less about the outward signs of achievement and ladder climbing\nthan in most conventional organizations. They keep their eyes on what they\nbelieve is truly important.\n\nOn my first full day on the job, I was directed to a cubicle that was just\nlike everyone else’s. Now, at the time of this writing, things have changed.\nRed Hat has moved its headquarters to a building in downtown Raleigh, where I\nhave an office with a door. It’s similar to the offices dozens of other people\nhave—maybe I have a better view than some—but it’s still far more mundane than\nthe standard, conventional executive suites of the past.\n\nThis meritocratic mind-set pervades the entire company, which now has sales,\ndevelopment, and support offices worldwide. Part of Red Hat lore, for\ninstance, is a picture that shows Brian Stevens, Red Hat’s former executive\nvice president and chief technology officer (CTO), with a bathroom plunger in\nhis hand. As the story goes, Stevens—who had been with Red Hat for years and\nworked at the engineering office in Westford, Massachusetts—was famous for his\nhands-on attitude in tackling everything from cleaning the office toilets to\nlugging huge computer servers to trade shows across the country.\n\nOf course, as CTO, Stevens could have ordered any number of people to tackle\nthose tasks. And certainly, as CTO of a company with some seven thousand\nassociates, he wouldn’t technically have to. But Stevens understood what the\nRed Hat culture is really built on: merit, not titles. Just as any\nentrepreneur can’t be too proud to tackle a job that needs to be done, so too\ndo executives like Stevens and me have to be willing to roll up our sleeves\nand join the fight on the frontlines rather than sitting back to direct the\nbattle from our posh corner offices.\n\nMarco Bill-Peter, vice president of customer experience and engagement who\nheads up the global support organization, says that what enables people to\nthrive in Red Hat’s culture is an informal personality. “The fact that we wear\njeans isn’t what makes us different from other companies out there,” says\nBill-Peter, who worked at tech giant Hewlett-Packard for thirteen years before\njoining Red Hat six years ago. “It’s really about a willingness to put aside\nyour ego while embracing openness and transparency. Titles don’t mean a thing.\nThat’s why, for example, I don’t print my title on any of my internal e-mails.\nEven when I introduce myself to other people in the company, I don’t talk\nabout how I’m a vice president. I usually just say, ‘I’m the support dude.’”\n\nRemember that someone wearing jeans and flip-flops can convey that she is\nstill the boss. Just look at a company like Apple, where Steve Jobs was\nnotorious for his casual dress, dating back to the company’s earliest days.\nBut, by most accounts, that didn’t really make him more approachable; he was\nstill at the center of Apple’s “Cult of the CEO” kind of culture where every\nimportant decision went through him. In other words, the simple act of wearing\njeans is not how you build engagement and break down hierarchies. It’s the\nattitude adjustments that need to go along with it.\n\nWhy Healthy Debates Matter\n\nThe lack of frank dialogue is the single biggest controllable weakness that\nmost companies impose upon themselves. Being nice and letting things slide add\nup over time to an organization that knows its core problems but is unable to\nact. While conflict avoidance isn’t a direct outcome of a conventional\norganizational structure, hierarchies clearly tend to soften bad news when\nit’s going up the chain. All but the brashest have difficulty asking questions\nin a rigid hierarchy. Finding ways to foster frank, productive feedback and\ndebate can improve the performance of any organization. For a meritocracy,\nit’s critical. As Ed Catmull of Pixar puts it:\n\n> > It isn’t enough merely to be open to ideas from others. Engaging the\n> collective brainpower of the people you work with is an active, ongoing\n> process. As a manager, you must coax ideas out of your staff and constantly\n> push them to contribute.

If there is more truth in the hallways than in meetings, you\n> have a problem.[15](index_split_019.html#filepos425822)\n\nNot every organization is prepared to change its culture in a way that allows\nsparks to fly. As I’ve described, it’s still a work in progress at Red Hat.\nSome people worry that my senior team is not functioning properly because of\nour open debates. I see it as the opposite. We have the open and frank debates\nwe need. We continue to foster this attitude throughout the company, while\nalso trying to find a balance between delivering good feedback and creating\narguments just for the sake of having an argument. Some people say that\nthey’ve waited to tackle new initiatives precisely because they weren’t\nmentally ready to deal with the feedback and challenges they would inevitably\nendure, no matter how valuable that information might be. We’re still\nlearning.\n\nJim’s Leadership Tips\n\n> 1.Proactively invite feedback and then thank those who give it to you.\n> Feedback is a gift. As a leader or manager, if you react defensively, you\n> are unlikely to get that gift again.\n\n> 2.Start a debate. If your organization isn’t used to open, frank debate,\n> start with easy topics.

If\n> so, think about what role you can play to initiate those discussions.\n\n\nPART THREE\n\nWHAT\n\nSetting Direction\n\n\n6\n\nMaking Inclusive Decisions\n\nThe conventional approach to decision making centers around equipping the\nresponsible person with the information needed to make an informed decision.\nIt’s about gathering facts and analysis and convening the appropriate team to\ngive input. Companies often have entire strategic planning departments\nanalyze, apply frameworks, and communicate recommendations. But in the end,\nbased on that information and feedback, the responsible executive makes the\ndecision.\n\nThe specific act of making a decision in a hierarchy can be very efficient.\nOnly a single individual is needed to make the call. That can be a real\nbenefit. However, as I described in [chapter\n3](index_split_010.html#filepos124058), there are myriad issues with this\nstyle of decision making. Appropriate information must flow unfiltered up the\nchain of command to the appropriate person in a timely way for him or her to\nmake the right decision. The decision maker must have the appropriate context\nin which to best make the decision. That’s a tall order. In this chapter, I\ndescribe the other major issue with the conventional decision-making approach,\nnamely, as a missed opportunity to build understanding, trust, and buy-in.\n\nMaking an executive decision by fiat is fast, but that’s when the real hard\nwork starts. Once a decision is made, it’s now time to execute and bring about\nwhatever changes were prescribed by that decision. Most major change projects\nfail. In an IBM study in 2008, researchers surveyed fifteen hundred executives\nin fifteen countries and found that some 60 percent of major projects fail to\nachieve their objectives.[1](index_split_019.html#filepos426133) Another\nstudy, conducted by the Standish Group, found that only 37 percent of projects\nare successfully implemented, with 21 percent of those failing completely,\nwhich leads to billions of dollars of lost resources and\nproductivity.[2](index_split_019.html#filepos426552) Those sobering statistics\nare probably only going to get worse. The speed of business is accelerating,\nwhich means organizations can’t afford to fail nearly 70 percent of the time.\n\nIn conventional organizations, frustrated executives—many of whom grumble that\ntheir people “don’t want to change”—turn to consulting firms that have built\nentire practices around something known as “change management.” Change\nmanagement is the common name for the efforts required to get an organization\nto implement an initiative that requires people to change their behavior.\nBigger decisions, ones that require significant change in what or how people\nwork, are particularly difficult to bring about. The company needs to\ncommunicate the decision, convince people, and so on. In short, change\nmanagement is hard.\n\nThese efforts, therefore, generally take a long time—possibly years—and are\nexpensive in terms of resources required. Almost certainly, more time, energy,\nand money are spent on change management efforts than are spent on making the\ndecision in the first place. Executives believe these massive efforts are\nrequired to overcome their organization’s unwillingness to change. Instead,\nthey should dig more deeply into how their own decision-making process may be\ncausing the problem.\n\nFirms like the clothing retailer Eileen Fisher, a global brand that emphasizes\norganically-grown fabrics for its clothes, have come to realize that the more\npeople they include from their organization in their decisions, the more buy-\nin they’ll receive as a result. Eileen Fisher created something it calls a\n“Leadership Forum,” which originally consisted of twenty-one key leaders from\nacross the company who met every three weeks or so to share information and\nmake decisions and recommendations. The Eileen Fisher team evolved that system\nstarting in 2007 when it began inviting people from nonsenior leadership\npositions to join the meetings as full participants, which helped both build\nrelationships within the company and also reinforce the two-way culture it was\ntrying to grow.[3](index_split_019.html#filepos427177)\n\nAfter a few years at Red Hat, I also found that if you include the very people\nwho will be affected in your decision-making process, change management\nbecomes unimportant. You won’t need to convince people, because they are\ninvolved in coming up with the answer. You’ll be amazed at how the results\ndiffer.\n\nThe Power of Including Others\n\nMarriott International, which began as a root beer stand in 1927 and now has\nmore than thirty-seven hundred hotels in seventy-four countries, credits its\ncore values—“Putting people first, pursuing excellence, embracing change,\nacting with integrity, and serving our world”—for driving that kind of\nsustaining growth and for extensive recognition for its culture and treatment\nof employees.[4](index_split_019.html#filepos427423) In an interview, J. W.\nMarriott Jr., former CEO of the company, discussed witnessing firsthand how\nformer president Dwight Eisenhower seemed to thrive on including the opinions\nof others in making decisions. Marriott said that affected how he made\ndecisions in his own company: “I tried to adopt that style of management as I\nprogressed in life, by asking my people, ‘What do you think?’ Now, I didn’t\nalways go with what they thought. But I felt that if I included them in the\ndecision-making process, and asked them what they thought, and I listened to\nwhat they had to say and considered it, they usually got on board because they\nknew they’d been respected and heard, even if I went in a different direction\nthan what they were recommending.”[5](index_split_019.html#filepos427666)\n\nSimilarly, Red Hat has taught me the power of inclusiveness to the extreme. I\nhave learned the value of getting associates involved in creating the\nsolutions rather than just sharing the decisions with them afterward. Go out\nand talk to the people with whom you work. By using technology as an ally, you\ncan reach out to far more people in the organization that can fit in any one\nmeeting room. When you do, be open, honest, and frank. One of the worst sins I\ncan commit, as a leader at Red Hat, is to surprise the organization with a\ndecision I make. People at Red Hat are generally happy—morale scores are very\nhigh—precisely because we make sure everyone who works here knows his or her\nrole in tackling the mission.\n\nMillennials, folks born between 1980 and 2000, have been discussed ad nauseam\nin the mainstream business literature. The general conclusion is that this\ngeneration is less trustful of established hierarchies and expects to have a\ngreater voice, especially in the workplace. They have grown up in a socially\nnetworked, information-rich environment where transparency and a free flow of\nideas are the norm. So, while innovative and highly creative, today’s workers\noften don’t see eye to eye with management—they may have opinions of their own\nabout the direction of the organization—and thus relish participation in just\nabout everything they do, whether across social networks or in the office in\ngeneral. This culture shift is forcing many organizations to rethink their\nstrategies for managing the modern workforce.\n\nAn example of this kind of change in action comes from the banking industry,\nwhich isn’t necessarily known for its cutting-edge management practices. But\nwhen Tim Elkins, executive vice president and chief information officer of\nPrimeLending, a mortgage provider with about 2,500 associates with more than\n250 branches across the United States, joined the company six years ago, it\ntook him about six months to acknowledge that something was different about\nthe company’s culture. After working in the mortgage lending industry for his\nentire career, he was used to organizations that relied on traditional top-\ndown hierarchical decision making.\n\nAt PrimeLending, Elkins was blown away by how Todd Salmans, the company’s CEO,\nwould huddle with his executive team twice a week to share updates from around\nthe company and to solicit ideas, rather than issue top-down directives of his\nown. “He says things like, ‘This is what I’m thinking, what do you think?’”\nsaid Elkins. “Ultimately he is the decision maker, but he’s actively seeking\nthe input of his direct reports. And that’s something that trickles down\nthroughout the organization.”[6](index_split_019.html#filepos428222)\n\nSimilarly, Scott Bristol, PrimeLending’s president, regularly sends out an\ne-mail to all employees asking for ideas about how the company could be run\nbetter or be a better place. “We’ve had quite a few wins come through that\nway,” said Elkins. “It proves that people can make a difference at whatever\nlevel they work on. Scott responds to every e-mail and it’s a great\nopportunity to get the ear of the president.”\n\nAs another example of the collaborative nature of PrimeLending’s culture,\nElkins pointed to the fact that he and his executive vice president peers meet\ntwice a week to talk through not just the good news, but also the challenges\neach faces on the job. In that way, they work together to solve the company’s\nbiggest issues rather than trying to defend their own turf. “One of the\nmantras we use around here is, ‘I’ve got your back,’” said Elkins. “I’ve never\nseen a group of managers at any level that are so open about their struggles\nbecause they know we will help each other rather than use it as an opportunity\nto help themselves.”\n\nElkins said he has applied those same principles to the one-on-one meetings he\nhas with his direct reports, where he allows his team members to set the\nagenda for what they want to talk about rather than making assumptions about\nwhat’s most important for them. By rethinking how to interact and collaborate\nin the workplace, PrimeLending not only has fostered a family-style\ncollaborative culture, but has also produced results: the company has now\ngrown into the fourth-largest purchase mortgage lender for home loans in the\nUnited States.\n\nRed Hat’s decision-making process also looks fundamentally different from how\nmost conventional organizations approach the process. We have embraced the\nvalue of participation, and we expect to involve broad groups of associates in\ndecisions. The best way that I can describe it is that we move most of the\nchange management activities into the decision-making process itself. It often\ntakes longer to reach a decision. The process can be slow and painful. Red Hat\nleaders sometimes moan when they know they must make a significant change,\nbecause they know they’re in for a lot of time, debate, and pushback. But the\nresult is that we end up making much better decisions, and perhaps more\nimportantly, we execute on those decisions with speed and efficiency.\n\nEven when Red Hat is dealing with a decision involving confidential\ninformation like an acquisition—laws prevent us from sharing that kind of\ninsider information with the investment community—it remains a priority for us\nto share and communicate what we can with our associates simultaneously or,\nwhere possible, even before we reach out to the company’s shareholders or the\npress. In other words, when Red Hat buys another company, we’re limited in\nwhat we can tell associates and when. But, beyond watching CNBC or reading a\npress release, Red Hatters also get the news from leadership in a way that\nstimulates a conversation about why we made the decision and what the company\nas a whole plans to do next. That means that sometimes you have to make\ndecisions that can be unpopular despite all the work you put in to listen and\nengage the team. But what you need to do is explain why you think the change\nis needed. Then, you need to prepare to defend your rationale.\n\nMost conventional organizations aren’t well structured to handle this kind of\nfeedback cycle with their employees. It’s not enough to simply communicate the\nresults of a decision after the fact. Our solution is to open things up by\nbreaking down conventional organization hierarchies. Specifically, we’ve\nembraced the idea of open organization such that the majority of our decisions\nand management procedures are transparent to our teams. At the same time, we\nuse input and feedback from associates to make decisions. Getting people to\nengage in the decision-making process doesn’t have to be at just the corporate\nlevel. It’s a mind-set that leaders throughout the organization should\nwholeheartedly embrace. That’s something the creative teams at Pixar practice\nin what I might call their “open movie-making process.” During the making of a\nmovie, everyone involved has the chance to add his or her input to the\ndirection of the project. But, in the end, it’s the director who makes the\nfinal decisions; like Red Hat, Pixar doesn’t operate a democracy where\neverything is put to a vote. But, as the authors of Collective Genius state,\n“the best directors were those open to a wide diversity of ideas, willing to\nlet people try different approaches, and able to keep possibilities open in\ntheir minds.”[7](index_split_019.html#filepos428432)\n\nConsider the story that Lance Phillips, Red Hat’s senior director of support\nfor the Americas, told us at an organizational meeting we were attending in\nMiami in the winter of 2012. Phillips had joined the Red Hat family in 2007\nwhen his prior employer, MetaMatrix, a data integration company based in St.\nLouis, was acquired so Red Hat could improve its position in the middleware\nmarket. Red Hat was interested in improving the way the customer support\ndepartment operated as well, which is why Phillips was “drafted,” as he puts\nit, into heading up global support for the Americas. “Red Hat liked the fact\nthat all of us at MetaMatrix had a lot of experience,” Phillips said. “We were\ntold they were excited to bring in senior managers like me to add value to the\norganization.” In other words, Phillips felt he was expected to bring about\nserious change.\n\nAfter commuting from his home in St. Louis to Raleigh for a few months (the\noriginal MetaMatrix team remained in St. Louis), Phillips—after long\nconversations with his wife—eventually settled permanently in North Carolina.\nSimilar to how a consultant might evaluate a new client’s challenges, Phillips\nused his first few months to study and think through the strengths and\nweaknesses of how the support team was structured. His boss, a vice president,\nhad given him the latitude to drive the change necessary to bolster the\nsupport team’s effectiveness. When he moved in for good, therefore, he thought\nhe was ready to put his well-thought-out plan in place. “I felt like I had\nbeen given the keys to the place and was ready to solve the world’s problems,”\nPhillips told me.\n\nSoon thereafter, at one of his leadership team’s weekly staff meetings,\nPhillips unveiled an action plan intended to, as he put it, “turn the ship\naround and get it pointed in the right direction.” The more he talked about\nhis visions for how the support team could be reorganized to best help Red\nHat’s clients, the more Phillips noticed people shutting down. “Pretty soon I\nwas looking at rows of stone faces,” he said.\n\nUnnerved by the experience, Phillips pulled his chief lieutenant, Maria\nDiMaio, aside to ask her why the meeting had gone so poorly. “We immediately\ngot into a passionate debate where she told me my ideas would never work at\nRed Hat,” Phillips recalled. “I just didn’t understand what was happening. I\nremember going home that night and complaining to my wife that the people at\nwork just didn’t understand change management.”\n\nFor her part, DiMaio, who had been working in the open source software\ncommunity for years before joining Red Hat, felt that she needed to fight\nback, because she thought that Phillips was putting the company’s culture at\nrisk with his approach to implementing change. “I was going home and telling\nmy husband that I felt like I was arguing myself out of a job,” DiMaio said.\n“But I felt like I had an obligation to represent the tenets of our culture:\ncourage, freedom, and open source. I wasn’t telling Lance we couldn’t do what\nhe was asking as much as I was telling him we had to go about doing it in a\ndifferent way.”\n\nOf course, it’s easy to sympathize with Phillips. After all, he had been hired\nspecifically to bring about change in the support organization. He even had a\nmandate from a vice president to do what he thought he needed to do. In most\norganizations, people would simply fall in line and follow their boss’s\norders. Why, then, wasn’t anyone, including DiMaio, his direct report,\nlistening to him and his ideas?\n\nPhillips was particularly frustrated by the fact that the team wasn’t buying\ninto his idea of changing where they were seated. Phillips wanted to shift\nworkstations around so that senior team members would sit next to younger and\nless experienced associates, who served as the first line of defense in\nanswering support calls from customers. That way, when questions and problems\ncame in from customers, the less experienced associates could simply turn\naround to get help rather than having to send an e-mail or pick up the phone.\n“I knew that we could share and transfer knowledge very quickly this way,”\nPhillips said.\n\nBut senior team members rejected the idea precisely because they didn’t want\nto have to sit next to where the phones rang the most. Facing a stalemate,\nPhillips quickly realized that he needed to change his entire approach. “If we\nhad simply issued an edict, there would have been a mutiny,” he admitted.\n\nTo his credit, though, Phillips didn’t give up. After realizing that he wasn’t\ngoing to bring about change simply by issuing orders or by sending out a memo,\nhe brought his team together and struck a bargain: he told them his reasons\nfor why the restructuring made sense and that if they would trust him enough\nto try it for a while, he would also commit to changing everything back if it\nwasn’t working.\n\n“Lance recognized that solving the problem was not about holding endless\ndiscussions or answering every concern before we took action,” DiMaio said.\n“It was more about acknowledging people’s concerns and then putting an exit\nplan in place if things didn’t work out. you’re always going to have\nstragglers to deal with, but they’re usually a small minority.”\n\nAs it turned out, everything worked out better than Phillips had dared to\nhope. Not only is the new structure still in place, but even the most vocal\nholdouts have admitted to him that working next to the phones “isn’t too bad.”\n“I think everyone came to understand that the benefits of the new plan\noutweighed most of the concerns people had been bringing up,” DiMaio said.\n\nThe entire experience taught Phillips that in order to bring about change, he\nhad to first explain why change was needed. He also had to listen to\neveryone’s concerns and make alterations to the plan based on that feedback.\n“Not having power is a scary thing for managers,” Phillips admitted. “But if\nyou truly engage individuals by giving that up and embracing an open source\nprocess, you actually get real power back because people will follow you\nbecause they trust you, not because you ordered them to.”\n\nPhillips calls his first encounter with the Red Hat culture the single most\nfrustrating and rewarding experience of his career. “I learned that at Red\nHat, almost nothing happens top down,” he said. “If you want to change\nsomething here, you need to socialize it, pull feedback, and build a movement\naround that change. The painful part of that process is that, for managers, it\ntakes much longer to get any change effort moving. The benefit, on the other\nhand, is that the adoption phase of change management is significantly\nshortened as you theoretically already have the buy-in. This is the key\nreason, in my opinion, we are so good at change and can keep pace with\ninnovation. It is part of our organizational DNA that we build momentum around\nchange from the bottom up.”\n\nAnother lesson to learn from Phillips’s story is that as a leader, you are the\nultimate decision maker. Remember, the company isn’t a democracy where\neveryone has an equal vote. You will sometimes have to make decisions that are\ndecidedly unpopular, despite all the work you put in to listen and engage your\nteam. But, as Phillips demonstrated, what you need to do is explain why you\nthink the change is needed. Then, you need to prepare to defend your\nrationale.\n\nIn choosing a software vendor to run our internal operations like payroll,\naccounting, and accounts payable, I had a similar experience. Because Red Hat\nis a publicly traded company with global operations and all kinds of reporting\ncomplications, few vendors actually make a system that suits our needs. After\nconducting an in-depth analysis of our needs, we eventually realized that\nthere was only one vendor who could give us what we needed. But there were two\nmajor catches: one, the software wasn’t open source, and two, the vendor was\none of our biggest competitors. It was quite a dilemma.\n\nIn most conventional organizations facing similar circumstances, the CEO would\nsimply make the choice and push that decision down through the organization.\nBut that wasn’t going to work at Red Hat. The team members making the decision\nknew that if we didn’t take the time to explain it, we would face an internal\npublic relations disaster. So the team went to memo-list to explain why we\nneeded this system and that, unfortunately, there were no open source\nalternatives to turn to.\n\nThe reaction to the post, despite our hopes, was decidedly negative. As the\ndiscussion threads grew, people wondered why we just didn’t build our own open\nsource product. The reason, I explained, was because of all the complex\nbusiness rules that go into building such a system and that we didn’t have the\nresources to manage such a system. The equation was simple: we needed the\nsystem’s capability immediately, and we didn’t have time to invest in building\nour own.\n\nWhile that eased the grumbling somewhat, it wasn’t until a member of the team\ncharged with the decision took to memo-list himself to explain in great detail\nhow he came to make the decision, along with a promise that we would\neventually move off our competitor’s product as soon as it was feasible. While\nthere are certainly people in the company who will never be satisfied with\nthat decision, the huge positive response that post received—where dozens of\npeople thanked him for explaining his rationale—proved that when you take the\ntime to make your decision-making process transparent, you can still drive\nprogress and get things done, even when your decision is an unpopular one.\n\nThere’s another lesson for leaders here as well: keep an open mind. While you\nmay be able to push forward unpopular decisions, you should continue to listen\nto the feedback you’re receiving while also constantly evaluating whether your\ndecision was, in the end, the best it could be.\n\nAnother example of how open collaboration leads to great decisions involved\nwhat we now call the “Billion Dollar Celebration,” a coordinated series of\nevents held at Red Hat locations worldwide to mark the year when the company\nfirst earned more than $1 billion in annual revenue. The roots of that\ncelebration were planted about a year and half earlier when, at a companywide\nmeeting, I was laying out my vision for how Red Hat would become a billion-\ndollar company. Someone in the audience then asked how we would celebrate that\nmoment when it arrived. I laughed off the comment and asked DeLisa Alexander,\nchief people officer, to come up with an answer.\n\nWhat happened next truly illustrates how things get done at Red Hat. Kim\nJokisch, director of the employment branding team that eventually pulled\neverything together, created a cross-functional team to spearhead the effort.\nShe recruited people from all over the company—including departments like\nemployment branding, corporate events, community affairs, public relations,\nand facilities management—to work on the project, which would involve time and\neffort well beyond their day jobs.\n\n“We used design thinking and included different people along the way,” says\nJokisch, whose team met weekly. Eventually, the team decided to announce the\nidea for celebration via “The Show,” a quarterly internal video program, in\nwhich everyone in the company was asked for input. Jokisch also recruited me\nas part of that effort: picture me in a pointed party hat, asking the\naudience, with a straight face and a serious voice, to submit their ideas—only\nto have Jokisch dump a bucket of confetti on my head. The clip ends as I blow\na note on a party horn—toot!\n\nWell, either because of—or in spite of—the skit, we got hundreds of responses\nfrom Red Hatters all over the world. The team then categorized the ideas and\nidentified several key themes. One common response was that people wanted to\ngive back to the open source communities that had helped Red Hat reach this\nlatest milestone. They also wanted to party and get Red Hat swag of some kind.\nThe fourth key theme was that they wanted us to recognize Red Hat as a truly\nglobal company.\n\nTo cover all those bases, the team again reached out to members of the Red Hat\ncommunity for help. First off, we asked Melanie Chernoff, who heads up Red\nHat’s charitable contribution efforts, to put together a short list of four\norganizations that Red Hat might want to acknowledge. We then took the list\nthat Chernoff and the community relations committee identified and asked\neveryone in the company to vote on a favorite. Each organization would then\nreceive a percentage of the money budgeted for the pot based on how many\nresponses it received (that is, if an organization got 30 percent of the\nvotes, it would receive 30 percent of the money). Everyone in the company had\na sense of ownership in the process and a chance to vote for the organization\nthey were most passionate about.\n\nThe committee also turned to the community for help in planning the party—or,\nmore accurately—the dozens of parties that were going to be held\nsimultaneously worldwide. The team worked with the finance department and\noffice managers around the globe to set budgets and then let every office\ndecide how it wanted to celebrate in its own unique way. In Australia, Red\nHatters went swimming with dolphins. In England, they took country-western\nline-dancing lessons. In Raleigh, we rented out a convention center and held a\ncarnival that included inflatable bounce houses and laser tag. Jokisch’s team,\nalong with several executives, fanned out and captured many of the\ncelebrations on video, which were subsequently shared via “The Show” so\neveryone could connect and see how their fellow Red Hatters liked to\ncelebrate.\n\nWhen it came to the swag, every Red Hat associate received a branded champagne\nflute that we all used to hoist a beverage of choice as I made my toast, which\nwas webcast around the world to every Red Hat office. The event was a massive\nsuccess that is talked about reverently, even today.\n\nAs Jokisch told me, “We didn’t go into this in any prescribed way. We let the\nbest ideas win and worked collaboratively and transparently to bring it all\ntogether. It’s really a great example of how we get things done the Red Hat\nway.”\n\nLeader’s Role: Making Transparent Decisions\n\nHere’s another example that illustrates how Red Hatters collect feedback as\nthey work through their decision-making processes. Not long after I became\nCEO, I realized that the organization’s vision statement did not provide a\ndirect link to our associates’ day-to-day actions:\n\n> > To be the defining technology company of the 21st century, and through our\n> actions strengthen the social fabric by continually democratizing content\n> and technology.\n\nWhile this statement showed the scale of our ambition—to be the defining\ntechnology company of the twenty-first century—I got the distinct impression\nthat many people didn’t understand what it meant or what it was telling them\nto do. As the company was entering new markets and experiencing tremendous\ngrowth, we clearly needed to refocus and refine our mission to serve as a\nunifying direction.\n\nIn most conventional organizations, like Delta Air Lines, the solution would\nhave been easy: I, as CEO, would convene a small group of senior executives\nwho, along with the help of an eloquent consultant, would craft the company’s\nmission statement during a weekend retreat. Once complete, it would simply be\ndistributed to the rest of the company. Shazam! Job done.\n\nWhat really happens in these cases is that, no matter how many copies of the\nmission statement you print out and hang by the coffee pot or near the soda\nmachine, the result is always the same: nobody remembers it. One executive I\nknew, when he visited other companies, carried a $50 bill with him to use as a\nchallenge. He would give that $50 to anyone who could recite the company’s\nmission statement. Guess what? He still has his $50.\n\nLuckily for me, my team knew the conventional top-down approach wouldn’t work\nat Red Hat. Our mission needed to emerge from within. For the mission to truly\nresonate with associates, they needed to be the ones to create it. So we\ndecided to do our best to ensure that everyone in the company would have a\nchance to participate.\n\nEven as I began discussing the mission statement, a passionate group of folks\nhad already come together and had begun thinking about how to solve the\nproblem. These people had joined forces to ensure that Red Hat’s corporate\nmission wasn’t just words on paper, but instead was deeply embedded within the\norganization. They had quickly come to the conclusion Red Hat needed something\nmore directional than the phrase “defining technology company” to connect the\noverall vision to the strategic plan.\n\nBy the time they approached me, the team had already crafted some sample\nmission statements for me to look at. We gathered around and looked at all of\nthe things they had come up with, debating the merits of each. In a few short\nhours of work, we developed a statement that felt pretty comfortable to all of\nus. But then we did something most companies wouldn’t dream of doing. Rather\nthan going straight to the senior executives to get their opinions first or\ncontinuing to muck around with the words for weeks or months to get them just\nperfect, we employed an open source technique our engineers sometimes refer to\nas “release early, release often.”\n\nInstead of crafting the company mission behind closed doors, we showed it to\nthe whole company via memo-list and my blog. In draft form. Before it was\nperfect. And we asked everyone what they thought of it. We asked which parts\nresonated most. We asked them what we should change. We asked for suggestions\nto make it better. Anyone could give feedback, and many did. There was\nthoughtful discussion, some fantastic suggestions for changing wording, even\nsome argument and disagreement about whether this truly reflected what the\ncompany was trying to achieve. This was a conversation the company needed to\nhave.\n\nOne key benefit of this approach was that it engaged many thoughtful\nassociates in a discussion about why they were doing their jobs. Rarely during\na hectic day (especially in a growing technology company) do people take the\ntime to think about the forest and not just the trees. Opening up the process\nof defining the Red Hat mission gave them an excuse to do exactly that. But\nperhaps the biggest benefit was that, by asking associates to become a part of\nthe process, and then taking some of their best feedback and using it to\nimprove the mission itself, we gave them ownership of the mission.\n\nIn the open source world, we believe the best ideas should win, no matter\nwhere they come from. Yet in many organizations, it is not possible for the\nbest ideas to win, because they are hidden in the brains of people who sit\nmany layers deep in the organization. The best ideas get lost as they make\ntheir way up through the hierarchy. We cut through the hierarchy and took our\ndraft of the mission statement right to the people to whom it mattered most.\nWe were able to get the best ideas, unfiltered by management, and apply them\nright away.\n\nUsing a fully transparent process to create our mission statement was a huge\nsuccess. It resonates with our people because it is a statement about not only\nwhat we do, but also how we do it. But you can judge for yourself:\n\n> > To be the catalyst in communities of customers, contributors, and partners\n> creating better technology the open source way.\n\nAllowing ideas to come from anywhere, opening up the creation of the mission\nso that anyone could contribute early in the process, promoting discussion and\ndialogue, and then finally allowing the best ideas to win—this is how we\ncreated our mission the open source way. The result is a great example of how\nour associates drove a much better answer than a few executives (no matter how\ntalented) could have done on their own. Associates were engaged and pleased\nwith the output. In the end, not only did we create a meaningful mission\nstatement, I would also wager that most, if not all, Red Hatters could cite it\nby heart.\n\nSlower Decisions Lead to Faster Results\n\nWhy would anyone go through all this work? It clearly slows decision making\ndown. It sucks up massive amounts of time for everyone. It’s frustrating. At\ntimes, it’s even infuriating. As a leader, it challenges your ego; having\npeople question, question, and question every decision you make is not fun. So\nwhy do it? The simple answer is because it leads to better decisions, better\nengagement, better execution, and ultimately better results.\n\nMaking decisions is easy compared to actually putting the ideas involved in\nthe decision into action, especially when your goal is to change something.\nThe rub, though, according to a 2004 study called “Boosting Business\nPerformance through Programme and Project Management” by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), is that a majority of companies, 59 percent,\nrealize a negative ROI when they undergo a major business improvement\nprogram.[8](index_split_019.html#filepos428669) That means that companies\ndon’t get much (if anything) for the money they invest in big decisions.\n\nThe PwC study found that the three biggest reasons projects failed to achieve\ntheir desired payoffs were due to:\n\n  * A lack of commitment and follow-through by senior executives.\n  * Defective project management skills among middle managers.\n  * Lack of training of and confusion among frontline employees.\n\nThe companies that achieved the best results, on the other hand, could boast\nthat:\n\n  * Senior and middle managers and frontline employees were all involved.\n  * Everyone’s responsibilities were clear.\n  * Reasons for the project were understood and accepted throughout the organization.\n\nThis study highlights some of the big reasons why the field of change\nmanagement has blossomed throughout the corporate world in recent years, where\ncompanies like my former employer, BCG, help shepherd such projects. For\ninstance, to save money, a large publishing company might decide to change how\nit prints and distributes its books. To help ensure that the changes needed in\npeople and technology go smoothly, it hires a firm like BCG to help drive\nparticipation and engagement throughout the organization to bring about the\ndesired changes.\n\nAt Red Hat, we do things differently. We strive for change management to\nhappen during the decision process, not during execution. We’ve learned that\nto bring about changes, it’s not enough to simply sell our associates on a\ndecision after it has been made. Rather, as in the example of our mission\nstatement, associates feel more ownership in the changes needed when they are\ninvolved in making the decision behind them.\n\nConsider the power of the practice that the manufacturer SRC Holdings calls\n“high-involvement planning,” a semiannual process in which department heads\nlay out their vision for where their part of the organization is headed in\nboth short and long terms—as far as five to ten years out. In combination,\nthey then explain the strategies and contingency plans that will help them\nmove closer to their goal. Anyone in the organization can then respond to\nthose strategies—asking questions or offering suggestions—before weighing in\nwith how confident they are in the plan. In other words, before a plan is put\ninto action, leaders get the opportunity to create buy-in among their\nassociates about where they are headed together. Since everyone has a chance\nto weigh in on the plans, it greatly reduces the finger-pointing and blaming\nthat is so common, especially when unexpected hurdles pop up. “We have\nstrength in numbers in contributing toward the direction of the organization,”\nsaid CEO Jack Stack. “With our different viewpoints, we can come up with the\nbest solutions and course of action.”[9](index_split_019.html#filepos429212)\n\nOther recent examples at Red Hat in which we have employed a similar inclusive\napproach to major companywide decisions include the development of the overall\nstrategy and branding plans, both projects that are led by my longtime\ncolleague Jackie Yeaney, who now heads up strategy and marketing at Red Hat\nand also worked with me at BCG and Delta. In most companies, senior leaders\nand consultants forge corporate strategy and marketing plans—like mission\nstatements—and then unveil them to the rest of the company. Just as often,\nthose strategy documents usually end up gathering dust on a bookshelf, unused\nand ignored despite the money and time that went into creating them.\n\nThat’s not the case at Red Hat. In 2008, we embarked on our first formal\nstrategic planning process. I was new to the company and felt we needed to\nmore formally articulate our medium-term goals (three to five years) and the\nkey initiatives required across the company to get there. That’s when I asked\nYeaney to help. Traditionally, this process is very top down. A small\nstrategic planning group works with senior leaders to develop the plan. But,\nas you know by now, that would never fly at Red Hat. Yeaney immediately set to\nwork involving the company in building a road map for where our strategy was\nheaded. By engaging an initial roster of leaders who would then connect with\ntheir teams, she put in motion a series of concentric circles like ripples on\na lake that eventually touched everyone. But instead of ripples that moved\nonly outward from her, they continued back and forth as they carried\ninformation and ideas throughout the company. The result was that rather than\nsenior leaders like Yeaney and me brainstorming where we thought the company\nshould head, we got feedback from the people closest to the frontline action\nwith the latest information that could help drive the process effectively.\n\nAs Yeaney wrote in a paper about the entire process titled, “Democratizing the\nCorporate Strategy Process at Red Hat,” “Red Hat is truly a meritocracy of\nideas—where the best ideas can come from anywhere in the organization. Many of\nRed Hat’s most successful products and services were built upon the hard work,\npassion, and commitment of one or more brilliant people inside (or even\noutside) the organization, not a top-down mandate. With this all in mind we\nknew we would have to make sure our process was democratized; less top-down,\nmore all-around.”\n\nThere is a saying at BCG that discovered logic is more powerful than delivered\nlogic. In the BCG context, this described why we liked having our clients\ninvolved in projects. When clients helped reach the conclusions about where\nthey were headed (in building a strategy document, acquiring a new business,\nor simply plotting their future course), they were much more likely to buy\ninto it. And guess what? The likelihood of our recommendations being\nsuccessfully implemented rose dramatically. The same principles apply to\nmaking decisions in your own company and involving your own people. The more\ntransparent you make the decision-making process, the more effectively you can\nturn those decisions into real action that everyone can engage in.\n\nYeaney said in her paper: “From the beginning, we put engaging with our\nassociates ahead of communicating to them. The entire company needed to own\nthe strategy if we wanted to see it implemented. Associates needed to be an\nintegral part of developing and implementing it.” Building engagement with all\nyour associates is a challenge that gets bigger relative to the size of your\npayroll. you’re likely going to have to invest more time and effort than you\nwould by simply delegating to a small team of consultants. But as the PwC\nstudy reminds us, you’re not going to get the kind of results you’re looking\nfor. At Red Hat, for example, it took Yeaney five months just to gather\ninformation from our associates.\n\nThe result, however, has been that Yeaney and I have never seen an\norganization follow through on its plan over a four-year period as Red Hat\nhas. Yes, it took a sizable commitment of resources to get everyone to buy\ninto the plan. But, by doing so, we’ve experienced tremendous success. As\nYeaney summarized it: “Since we started this process in 2008, Red Hat has been\nexecuting more efficiently on its best opportunities, and it shows. Red Hat\nhas grown from $400 million in revenue to more than $1.5 billion and the stock\nprice has quadrupled.”\n\nDeciding Inside Out\n\nWe’ve been able to apply these same principles and processes of decision\nmaking in involving not just Red Hatters, but our customers and partners as\nwell. That’s something other organizations have also begun to embrace. For\nexample, every five years Whole Foods brings together representatives of its\nprimary stakeholder groups to collaborate in designing the next five-year\nstrategic vision through a process it calls “Future Search,” in which\ncustomers and vendors participate alongside other company stakeholder groups\nto shape plans for Whole Foods’\nfuture.[10](index_split_019.html#filepos429484)\n\nAt Red Hat, we do something along these lines that we call the Red Hat Summit.\nIt’s a nearly weeklong event where we bring customers, partners, community\nenthusiasts, and Red Hatters—from across the globe—together in person. In\n2014, for example, we held the summit in San Francisco and attracted thousands\nof attendees who participated in a series of nearly two hundred different\nsessions, panel discussions, hands-on labs, and more.\n\nThe summit has become a way for associates to connect in deep and meaningful\nways with customers, which makes it an incredibly vital part of Red Hat’s\nfuture success. “The summit allows us to create more opportunities to have\nface-to-face conversations with our customers and community enthusiasts about\nwhat’s important to them and how we can help,” said Leigh Blaylock, who, as\nRed Hat’s manager of content marketing, plays an integral role in successfully\norchestrating the coordination of the summit content.\n\nMost companies hold similar customer-focused events, but what makes the Red\nHat Summit unique is how we go about setting the agenda. In most companies,\nthe speakers, classes, and breakout sessions for their events are established\nin an efficient, top-down manner. But at Red Hat, we do it differently and we\nhave for a long time.\n\nIn the open source world, many conferences are organized in a free-form and\ninformal manner, where the participants themselves set the agenda. An example\nis BarCamp, an international network of user-generated “unconferences” where,\nat the start of the conference, people who want to make a presentation tape\nthe name of the session they propose on a board along with all other\nsuggestions. Once complete, participants then vote on which sessions they want\nto attend, which results in the agenda for the conference.\n\nWhile that kind of decentralized planning works well with small groups, we\ncan’t employ the exact same method for planning the summit for thousands of\npeople. But we also don’t want to lose what makes the BarCamp approach so\nspecial by implementing a conventional top-down process. Instead we start out\nwith a ten-person screening committee from different departments that taps our\ninternal communities and works from the bottom up to identify the different\ntracks to cover at the event, like IT efficiency or business and strategy\nalignment. We then issue a request for proposals from all\ncommunities—including customers and partners—for specific session, panel, and\nlab ideas. In 2014, we received a total of 686 proposals. Obviously, that’s a\nlot to choose from.\n\nBut, again, rather than make the pruning decision top down or marketing\ndriven, we create a cross-functional selection subcommittee composed of nearly\n150 Red Hatters who represent several departments and all regions, to make the\nagenda decisions. Subcommittee members are nominated by an eighteen-person\nmain selection committee, which includes representatives who know IT needs\nbest, like our own IT team, and those who know customers best, like\nengineering, support, and sales. Members from both committees tend to be Red\nHatters who have strong reputations within the company.\n\nSubcommittee members rate and comment on sessions via an online tool, which\nthe main selection committee uses to discuss and debate the various proposals\nvia Etherpad, an open source document collaboration tool that records\neveryone’s contributions in real time. “Each person’s contributions are\ntracked with a different color, and those documents get pretty colorful, as\nyou can imagine,” said Blaylock. Members of the committee also rely on past\nspeaker ratings and session feedback notes, which have been kept since the\n2009 summit, as a way to ensure that the best ideas win—and the best speakers\nreturn—as objectively as possible. Once the debate concludes, the agenda has\nbeen set.\n\nThe key point, clearly, is that by applying the notion of a meritocracy to the\nprocess of choosing summit sessions, we wind up with a compelling and wide-\nranging agenda that delivers incredible value and learning to all those who\nattend, particularly because customers and partners are active participants in\nthe entire event. Partners and customers frequently say that the Red Hat\nSummit has more authenticity and passion than a typical IT conference. I\nfirmly believe that the difference is in our decision-making process.\n\nGetting Started\n\nThe good news about inclusive decision making is that it’s easy to start. You\ncan simply ask a few others (or two or ten) for their thoughts on a decision\nyou are making. Unlike engagement, which I argue in [chapter\n3](index_split_010.html#filepos124058) is an all-or-nothing proposition,\ninclusive decision making is a continuum. As a leader, you can experiment with\nhow broadly to include others.\n\nThe bad news is that you will find that many people do not want to\nparticipate. Not everyone wants to be a leader or make decisions that affect\nothers. It also takes time for groups to rewire themselves to make decisions.\nIncluding broader parts of your organization in decision making is something\nto approach incrementally.\n\nJim’s Leadership Tips\n\n> 1.When you make your next decision, reflect on whether it was influenced by\n> others’ points of view. If so, did their influence change your decision?

An open organization encourages and fosters\ninitiative and creativity among its members rather than, as Andrew McAfee of\nthe MIT Center for Digital Business puts it, running operations based on\n“HiPPO—the highest-paid person’s\nopinion.”[1](index_split_019.html#filepos429821) The new model that is\nevolving also appeals to a new generation of employees whose expectations are\nvastly different from those of people who preceded them in the workplace.\n\nA core function of management systems that I’ve yet to discuss is setting\ndirection. Traditionally, direction is set at the top. The typical structural\nsolution at most companies includes a strategy or strategic planning\ndepartment. These organizations typically have a handful of bright MBAs with\nskills and training in strategic frameworks, planning, and the like. Working\nwith senior management and perhaps a few consultants, they help craft the core\nstrategies that the organization ultimately follows. Strategic directives are\nthen handed down for execution throughout the company. It’s simply assumed at\nmost companies that the senior executive team and the board of directors set\nstrategy.\n\nObviously, top-down directives don’t do well in open organizations. So, given\nthis new type of organization, if you have all these engaged and passionate\npeople ready to take on the world, how do you, as a leader, set the direction\nin which the company is going? If you can’t just issue an order and say,\n“We’re going to take that hill!” then how do you get the organization to do\ndifferent things, or do things differently? How do you as a leader get\neveryone in a participative company to change or to move together in the same\ndirection?\n\nIntroducing the Catalyst in Chief\n\nAfter my first year at Red Hat, I began to wonder what my role as the\npresident and CEO truly was. By that point I’d begun to understand and\nappreciate both the power and the subtlety of Red Hat’s culture and\nparticipative management model. Clearly, continuing to drive and reinforce the\nsystem was job one. But what was less clear to me was the role I needed to\nplay in driving changes in strategic direction. I’m sure many other Red Hat\nleaders have asked themselves that same question.\n\nThe answer came to me as I reflected on our mission statement. As you might\nremember from [chapter 6](index_split_015.html#filepos279794), it reads: “To\nbe the catalyst in communities of customers, contributors, and partners\ncreating better technology the open source way.” The more I thought about\nthis, the more I realized that the answer was right in front of me. My role as\na leader was to be the catalyst for the organization itself.\n\nOne of the most difficult and subtle parts of fine-tuning that statement was\nsettling on the right word (or words) to describe the role Red Hat aspires to\nplay in the open source communities in which we operate. In early drafts, we\nused the word “leader.” But many people involved in the process quickly\npointed out that this word wasn’t entirely accurate. Leadership, in their\nview, implies a level of control that we at Red Hat do not have, nor aspire to\nhave, within our communities. We treasure the concept of meritocracy, and\ncalling Red Hat the leader seemed to imply that somehow the rules didn’t apply\nto us.\n\nWe next tried substituting the phrase “active participant.” That was softer\nand more accurately described how we contribute to the communities in which\nwe’re involved, but again, it wasn’t quite right. We aspire to do more than\njust contribute; we want to influence the direction of these communities, yet\nnot control them either.\n\nUltimately, we arrived at the word “catalyst”—“an agent that provokes or\nspeeds significant change or action”—and I think it best describes how Red Hat\nprovides leadership in the communities in which we operate. We contribute to\nour communities, doing what we believe is in their best long-term interest, by\nbuilding up positions of thought leadership within. In that way, Red Hat\nserves as an agent that provokes or speeds change or action in the open source\ncommunities in which we operate. The more I thought about it, the more I\nrealized that this concept also provides a good model for the role of leaders\nin the twenty-first century.\n\nLeaders have many opportunities to act as an “agent.” We have the ability to\ncall meetings and talk about what we think is important, to ask questions and\nget answers, and to structure areas of work. All are opportunities to catalyze\ndirection. I’m not a chemist, so a good mental image for me is to think about\na dock piling at an ocean shore. Look at any piling and you’ll see an\nabundance of sea life attached to it. Barnacles attach to the piling and then\nattract additional sea life, which feeds on the barnacles and might also make\na home there. Before you know it, there’s an entire mini-ecosystem around that\npiling. But if the piling were not there, none of that sea life would have\nchosen to grow at that exact spot. The piling created the context and vehicle\nfor life to congregate. Simply by being there, it fosters a new community,\nwhich is a key dynamic of catalyzing an open organization.\n\nBut there are also moves—some subtle, others more overt—that you can take to\nsway the kind of actions that your participative community undertakes.\n\nThe Leader’s Role: Leverage Your Soap Box\n\nOne of the benefits of being a leader is that you have the power to create\nvenues for bringing people together, and you have the power to set the agenda\nfor a range of conversations throughout the organization. After being at Red\nHat for several years, I hope that I have personally earned the right to be\nheard in our meritocracy. But even in our culture, my title certainly helps.\nGenerally, because of my role, people will make the time to listen to me, and\nthey will seriously consider what I’ve said. I get their attention. When and\nhow I, as a leader, use those venues can be a powerful way for me to influence\nthe direction of the company.\n\nWhen I address the company either in a formal way, say, at a quarterly company\nmeeting, or in more informal settings, like the ad hoc town hall–style Q&As I\nhold in our global offices, what I talk about, the questions I ask, and the\nissues I raise foster discussion and debate throughout the entire company. I\nhave the opportunity to light little sparks and see what passionate fires\nerupt from there. But because I am only offering a spark, it’s the subsequent\nconversations people have with their peers throughout the organization that\ntruly result in things happening.\n\nI am not talking about announcing formal initiatives that have already been\nfully vetted and decided upon. That’s nothing more than personally delivering\na top-down decision. Rather, I use these opportunities to poke and prod on\nissues that I believe are important to Red Hat. The subsequent conversations\nand activities around the company will ultimately coalesce into the\nappropriate initiatives. My job as catalyst is to stir the debate and ignite\nthe conversations. From there, our associates, through their own conversations\nand debate, will drive the ultimate actions.\n\nFor instance, Red Hat has emerged as a leader in the field of cloud computing.\nWe are the leading contributors to and sellers of the infrastructure software\nused to run public and private clouds. The specific initiatives to establish\nthat position didn’t emerge from a top-down strategy process. They came from\nthe senior team at Red Hat describing how important it was for Red Hat and\nopen source to emerge as the default choice for next-generation IT\ninfrastructure. That’s as directive as we needed to be. Myriad debates have\nsubsequently raged within the company over specific technologies, markets, and\nbusiness models. Those debates have and are leading to much better execution\nthan we could ever have prescribed from the top down. Frankly, the market\nchanges so rapidly that any structured plan would be obsolete in months.\nInstead, the people closer to the facts and activities in the marketplace are\nmaking the decisions on the specifics. And they are empowered to react\nquickly, which keeps our strategies from getting stale.\n\nWhole Foods operates in a similar way. Since the company continues to expand\nrapidly, it now has four hundred stores but has a goal of eventually operating\ntwelve hundred.[2](index_split_019.html#filepos430142) It couldn’t possibly\nhope to keep up with all the trends and tastes of those local markets through\na centralized command system. Rather, CEO John Mackey has made it clear that\nregions and stores have the freedom to experiment with a mix of non–Whole\nFoods–branded products as they see fit. That’s especially true when it comes\nto how those stores support the burgeoning local foods movement, says Mackey,\n“which allows a constant supply of new and innovative products to bubble up\nfrom local sources, with the most successful ones eventually spreading across\nthe company.”[3](index_split_019.html#filepos430602) To put that another way,\nMackey allows his leaders at the regional and store levels to essentially\nchart the future mix of products for the entire company as a whole because he\ntrusts that they know and care about the company’s purpose and mission. That’s\npowerful stuff.\n\nObviously, leveraging a soapbox requires that venues exist where leaders are\ninteracting with their employees. Having a regular cadence of opportunities\nfor these types of interactions is critical. At Red Hat, we have quarterly\ncompany meetings, though because of our size and global spread, most\nassociates dial in by phone or via their computer to access them. We do,\nhowever, have vehicles for associates to e-mail questions or ask during\nconference calls. I still find face-to-face interactions are most productive.\nTime zones and distance can be barriers, so the senior team and I try to\nschedule town hall meetings when we visit locations worldwide. Within Red Hat,\nI’m not alone. Many Red Hat managers and leaders create similar forums within\ntheir own organizations. Every company is different, but regardless, ensuring\nthat venues for interaction exist should be a priority.\n\nSelling Half-Baked Thoughts\n\nOften leaders have a general sense of where they want to lead the company, but\nhave not yet nailed down the specifics. Unfortunately, too often leaders are\nuncomfortable sharing plans that aren’t complete. They worry that they are not\nsetting clear goals or that ambiguity will cause more harm than good. In a\nparticipative organization, this is a great time to engage. It often means\narticulating aspirational goals (as long as they are consistent with the\npurpose and values) without specifics on how to get there. Particularly when\nthe specific implementation steps aren’t yet clear, involving associates early\nis a great way to help identify priorities and create alignment throughout the\norganization. The goal, in short, is to make the most of the knowledge and\nskills of the broader organization to fill in the details. As Daniel Goleman,\nauthor of the influential book Emotional Intelligence, describes in his\ndefinition of “primal leadership,” there is an emotional dimension to\nleadership where a leader’s primary task is to “articulate a message that\nresonates with their followers’ emotional reality, with their sense of\npurpose—and so to move people in a positive direction. Leadership, after all,\nis the art of getting work done through other\npeople.”[4](index_split_019.html#filepos430850)\n\nFor example, as I’ve described throughout the book, Red Hat has built an\nextremely successful business by catalyzing open source communities. It’s deep\nin our DNA and is our source of competitive advantage. It allows the company\nto deliver cutting-edge technology at dramatically lower prices than our\ncompetitors can provide. In short, our competitive advantage is built around a\ncapability to leverage open source. Since we do deliver such a great value\nproposition, customers generally like us. Surveys suggest that we have very\nhigh levels of customer satisfaction, and we receive very high Net Promoter\nscores—a high percentage of our customers say they will recommend Red Hat to\nfriends or other potential customers.\n\nHowever, as Red Hat has grown and the customer base has expanded beyond the\nearly adopters who are technology savvy and value the technical merits of our\nsolutions, I’ve worried about whether the company is truly focused on the\nneeds of our mainstream customers. While organizations like the New York Stock\nExchange Euronext and DreamWorks care about the performance of our products,\nmost mainstream IT customers care more about issues like ease of use and\nquality of documentation. In addition, as Red Hat has become a larger part of\nour customers’ IT infrastructure, and as they begin to use more of our\nproducts, they expect us to understand their businesses. They expect us to\noffer solutions to their problems, not just offer great technology.\n\nSo clearly Red Hat needs to become more customer focused as it grows. The\nquestion is where to start. Some areas are clearly apparent, like making\nproducts easier to install. No one would disagree with that. Other areas are\nsubtler. For instance, we need to ensure that our product road maps meet the\nneeds of customers, such as by including ease-of-use features. But that’s not\nnecessarily what open source focuses on. Open source is known for driving\ngreat technical solutions, and developers pride themselves on offering\ntremendous flexibility to the user. But they frankly don’t worry as much about\nwhether the resulting products are simple to use. It’s almost a badge of honor\nto “drop to the command line,” which is techno-speak for using a text-based,\nterminal window that looks like it’s from circa 1970. So while I clearly want\nRed Hat to listen to customer needs and be responsive, I also recognize our\ncore source of competitive advantage is built on using the power of open\nsource.\n\nIn a conventional organization, the answer to my desire to improve customer\nfocus would be to form a team to develop recommendations on a plan. The team\nwould analyze products and processes and would develop a set of\nrecommendations for where to improve customer focus. The team would also look\nat areas of potential conflict, like customers’ desire for ease of use. It\nwould recommend specific initiatives and actions. I would then announce a\n“focus on the customer” initiative that would be rolled out across the\ncompany.\n\nAt Red Hat, I can effect the same result by simply talking about it. Using my\nstage, I “sold” the idea that this is an important thing for us all to\naddress. I explained how, by listening to and working more closely with our\ncustomers, we might make the technology even more powerful and the company\nmore successful as a whole. I also explained my concerns about the trade-offs\nof staying on the bleeding edge of technology and also being responsive to\nmainstream customers. But that was it. I didn’t lay out any specifics about\nhow we could go about making ourselves more customer focused. I didn’t charter\na team. Rather, I laid out the context that helped illustrate how critical\nmoving in that direction could be for the future of the company. In that way,\nwhat I was selling was a “half-baked” idea.\n\nWhat happened was that people throughout the organization began to do things\nto improve engagement with customers. Multiple initiatives emerged across the\ncompany. For instance, Marco Bill-Peter, who heads Red Hat’s global support\norganization, took up the challenge in his own way. Without any direct orders\nissued from me, he created a unique approach to solving customers’ problems.\nRather than the conventional approach in which a customer calling with a\ncomplex problem would be bounced around before he or she would finally connect\nwith the expert who could actually solve the issue, Bill-Peter and his team\ncame up with the concept of a “swarm,” which comprised cross-departmental\nteams of service reps and engineers with different levels of knowledge capable\nof handling just about any kind of issue. That meant that any time a customer\ncalled in, he or she was connected with a team that was motivated to find a\nsolution rather than just punting the ball farther down the line.\n\nJust as importantly, the introduction of the swarm doubled the number of\ncustomers who engaged with us, while simultaneously cutting the cost of\nsupport as a percentage of the company’s overall revenue. The results earned\nBill-Peter and his team accolades from around the industry and from\npublications like The Economist, which wrote a case study about Red Hat’s\ninnovative solution to delivering enhanced customer service. The swarm\napproach to connecting and engaging with customers has become so effective\nthat teams across the business—from product documentation to legal—are\nstarting to form and join swarms. “As a company, we see this collaborative\nmodel going into other fields,” Bill-Peter told The Economist. “It leads to\ninnovation across the business and makes people think about how they do\nthings.”[5](index_split_019.html#filepos431163)\n\nMore to my point in this chapter, Bill-Peter heard me and went about\nconnecting the dots in his own way to tie Red Hat more closely to customers,\nwhich is something he admits he would not have had the freedom to do at his\nformer employer, the tech giant Hewlett-Packard. That’s a great thing, because\nI’m not sure I would have been able to think of doing such a thing myself and\nthen trying to get someone else to implement it. Again, Bill-Peter wasn’t\nfollowing an order; he made up his own mind that it was an important task to\nundertake, and he and his team came up with their own unique way to implement\na solution.\n\nI am convinced that the resulting activities that we’ve undertaken are better\nthan we would have identified with a formal team. I’m comfortable admitting\nthat I just don’t have all the answers, and that no ad hoc team can fully\nspecify all the appropriate activities. By having capable, engaged people\nrecognize the importance of the goal and then expecting them to solve it in\ntheir own way, thousands of small tweaks can be made across the company.\nThat’s much richer and subtler than the handful of big initiatives that a top-\ndown planning process would generate. And things happen much, much faster\nthroughout the organization than if I wanted to control every decision that\nwas made on a regular basis.\n\nEstablishing the Right Amount of Structure\n\nPart of the art of leading a self-directing, engaged organization is to spark\nthe organization to action. The specificity of those goals and targets can\nvary along a spectrum from ultra-specific numeric targets against discrete\nobjectives to very macro-level, subjective notions like “We need to improve.”\nIf your aim is too precise, you might turn people off or send them in the\nwrong direction by giving them too much direction. At the same time, if you\nmake the goals too broad, you might not inspire any action whatsoever or be\nleft with utter chaos as people run off in multiple directions at the same\ntime. So the goal is to try and create enough structure around the\norganization’s actions without creating too much. Finding the balance is a\nreal art.\n\nW. L. Gore is noted for its complete lack of hierarchy, despite having nine\nthousand associates spread among thirty countries. The company intentionally\nkeeps its teams small, two hundred people or fewer, as a way to foster\ncreativity and innovation. Gary Hamel has written extensively about the\ncompany and about its founder Bill Gore, who wanted his company to have a\n“lattice” as its base for a corporate structure where there were “no layers of\nmanagement, information would flow freely in all directions, and personal\ncommunications would be the norm. And individuals and self-managed teams would\ngo directly to anyone in the organization to get what they needed to be\nsuccessful.”[6](index_split_019.html#filepos431615) In a conversation with\nHamel, Terri Kelly, Gore’s CEO, talked about how its teams, not the leaders at\nthe top, make the decisions that drive the company forward because they are\ntrusted to act in the best interests of the company:\n\n> > First of all, there are norms of behavior and guidelines we follow . . .\n> Every associate understands how important these values are, so when leaders\n> make decisions, people want to understand the “why.” They know they have the\n> right to challenge, they have the right to know why this decision is the\n> right one for the company . . . [O]ur leaders have to do an incredible job\n> of internal selling to get the organization to move. The process is\n> sometimes frustrating, but we believe that if you spend more time up front,\n> you’ll have associates who are not only fully bought-in, but committed to\n> achieving the outcome. Along the way, they’ll also help to refine the idea\n> and make the decision better.[7](index_split_019.html#filepos431805)\n\nIn the example I shared about Red Hat’s increased customer focus, we as a\nmanagement team were intentionally broad when introducing the concept.\nEveryone should have a sense for how his or her role ultimately translates to\ncustomer value, so it should resonate with everyone. In addition, I had no\nspecific areas that I wanted to ensure were addressed. So we simply stated the\nproblem and asked the organization to respond. There are other times when\nadding a bit of structure can be helpful. Take, for example, efforts to\nincrease the share of users who opt to pay for Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\nversus choosing another paid or free Linux distribution. This was a key\nopportunity that we identified in our strategic planning process. We believe\nthat we add tremendous value in our paid-for subscription version. Since Linux\nis free, however, there are obviously many alternatives in the marketplace for\nwhich users don’t have to buy a subscription.\n\nFrom research, we knew that there were three major areas of opportunity:\npeople using our product but without an active subscription, people who had\nused to subscribe but let their subscriptions lapse, and people using free,\ncommunity versions of Linux. Maybe the organization could address all three\nareas from a simple high-level challenge to address “free to paid,” but I\nworried that some areas might not realize their importance in solving the\nproblem. Without a doubt, engineering and sales would jump in and begin\nworking to better communicate our value proposition and improve usability, but\nmy team and I realized that much of the work required to address unpaid usage\nof the product and renewals would come from other areas of the business. So\nthe team worried that, without a bit more direction, a broad statement of\n“free to paid” would send some groups scurrying, while others would feel it\nwas not relevant to their area.\n\nRenewals are a great example. Obviously, for a subscription business, renewals\nare a key value driver. Much of what drives renewals is hard-core operational\nwork. Because our products are often sold preloaded on a manufacturer’s\nhardware or sold in less developed areas through multiple distribution levels,\nwe often do not know who the end customer is. Improving renewals entails\nworking on myriad operational and legal issues. It involves substantial IT\nwork to improve internal data. We have to work with partners to encourage and\nmotivate them to drive renewals and write tighter contracts with distribution\npartners to share end-user information where appropriate. Without providing a\nspecific initiative—around which to catalyze this work—many of our operations\nassociates would not have recognized the vital role that they play every day\nin ensuring customers continue to enjoy the benefits of Red Hat subscriptions.\n\nA similar dynamic of people and activities exists in addressing customers who\nwere using subscriptions without paying for them. So the solution we came up\nwith—to ensure that we addressed all the major areas of “free to fee”—was to\nbreak the larger issue down into three more manageable ones:\n\n> > Subscription education: Developing programs to identify and educate\n> organizations that are using subscriptions but not paying us for them.\n\n> > Renewals: Focusing on many operational, technical, and process issues to\n> ensure that we know what subscriptions are about to expire and that someone\n> at Red Hat or a partner is asking that customer to renew.\n\n> > Community-to-enterprise: Improving products and better communicating the\n> value of a relationship with Red Hat relative to other alternatives.\n\nOnce we identified these groups, internal teams tackled the specifics of how\nto solve them, and they did an amazing job. The results have been fantastic.\nAgain, the goal was to find that sweet spot at which we could create enough\nstructure so that people knew where we wanted to make progress, while also\nhaving the freedom to come up with their own ideas for meeting their goals.\n\nAvoiding the Big Mistakes\n\nMany people who read about this distributed—and let’s face it,\nchaotic—approach to driving strategy might think that it sounds like a recipe\nfor disaster. Obviously, all of the various initiatives that emerge haven’t\nbeen fully analyzed and vetted in the way that top-down initiatives typically\nare. Isn’t that risky? Won’t many fail? The simple answer is yes. Some of the\nthings we try fail, though I’m not sure the failure rate is higher than with\ntop-down initiatives. I feel pretty certain that it’s lower. Still, without\nproper top-down vetting, how do we know if we are taking undue levels of risk?\nHow do we identify efforts that aren’t working before we squander large\namounts of resources on them?\n\nOpen source development communities solve this problem by focusing on making\nmany small, incremental changes rather than a few large ones in what’s\ntypically referred to as “release early, release often.” A key issue in any\nsoftware project is the risk of errors, or bugs, in the code. Obviously, the\nmore changes are lumped together in one release of software, the greater the\nlikelihood that the release will also introduce bugs. So open source\ndevelopers have found that by releasing early and often, they can reduce the\nrisk that any release has major problems. Over time, we’ve observed that this\nmethodology not only reduces the risk of bugs, but also leads to greater\ninnovation. It turns out that making many small improvements continuously\nultimately creates more innovation. Perhaps this shouldn’t be surprising. One\nkey tenet of modern manufacturing process methodologies, like kaizen or lean,\nis to continually focus on small, iterative improvements.\n\nAs Clay Shirky, author of Here Comes Everybody, comments about open source:\n“Because anyone can try anything, the projects that fail, fail quickly, but\nthe people working on those projects can migrate just as quickly to the things\nthat are visibly working. Unlike the business landscape, where companies have\nan incentive to hide both successes (for reasons of competitive advantage) and\nfailures (to forestall any perception of weakness), open source projects\nadvertise their successes and get failure for\nfree.”[8](index_split_019.html#filepos431961)\n\nLike so many other aspects of its management system, Red Hat has adopted this\nsame principle for internal initiatives. We call our internal corollary to\nrelease early, release often “failing fast.” Failing fast recognizes that many\nthings we try may not work. But rather than spending tons of time trying to\nanalyze which will work and which will not, we allow many small experiments.\nThose that gain momentum continue to grow, while those that don’t are allowed\nto wither away. In this way, we can try many things without any single one\ncreating too much risk for the company.\n\nThis is a powerful way to allocate resources. For example, people often ask me\nhow we decide which open source projects to commercialize. Though we sometimes\ninitiate projects, most often we simply become involved in existing ones. A\nsmall group of engineers—sometimes a single person—begins contributing as an\nopen source community. If the community begins to thrive and our customers\nbegin to get involved, we increase our effort. If not, the engineers move to a\nnew project. By the time we decide to commercialize an offering, the project\nhas grown to the point where the decision is obvious. Projects of all kinds,\nbeyond just software, naturally emerge throughout Red Hat until it’s obvious\nto everyone that someone needs to work on it full-time.\n\nThe concept of making small, incremental advances and failing fast aren’t\nunique to open source and Red Hat. Scott Cook, founder of software company\nIntuit, which makes Quicken and TurboTax, among other products, once said,\n“When the bosses make the decisions, decisions are made by politics,\npersuasion, and PowerPoint. When you make decisions through experiment, the\nbest idea can prove itself.” I was so taken with that notion that I searched\nand found more about his philosophy. “I believe the new skill in leadership is\nleadership by experiment,” Cook once told an audience. “In other words,\ndecisions made by having a hypothesis that you then\ntest.”[9](index_split_019.html#filepos432234)\n\nThat concept is also related to what electronics giant National Instruments\n(NI) calls “ooch by ooch.” “To “ooch” things means to sort of inch them along,\ntaking small, incremental steps, while avoiding unnecessary risks,” NI CEO\nJames Truchard has commented. “You don’t need a home run, just\npersistence.”[10](index_split_019.html#filepos432648)\n\nUnanswered Questions Remain\n\nWhile Red Hat’s leadership and management system evolved organically out of\nthe open source software movement, it remains a work in progress. We continue\nto seek ways to tweak and improve it to meet the demands of running, in our\ncase, a twenty-first-century public company. An area of particular interest\nfor me is how to be the best leader possible in this new environment. As we\nhave begun to think of leaders more as catalysts than dictators or generals,\nI’ve learned firsthand how leaders—including CEOs—need to adapt to the new\ndynamics involved in leading participative communities if they want to reap\nthe benefits of speed and innovation from them.\n\nFor example, in my role as catalyst, I strive to encourage debate and\ndiscussion about the direction in which we want to move as an organization.\nBut a key question then becomes, “How long do you let debates rage?” Or even,\n“How decisive should a leader be?” Those questions are tough to answer,\nespecially at Red Hat where debates can last literally for months on end,\nmaybe even years if they involve anything related to open source versus\nproprietary software.\n\nBut while it might seem clear that a debate that goes on for too long becomes\nunproductive and a drain on time and resources, it’s a constant struggle not\nto step in too soon and create serious engagement issues as a result. The\ntruth is that I’m not sure there is a right or wrong answer to the question of\nhow long you allow debates to continue. It almost comes down to a gut feeling,\nan intuitive sense that the time has come to finally make a decision. Debates\nusually resolve themselves, though. Typically, after a few days, people run\nout of things to say on memo-list or others start saying, “Enough already!”\n\nEven then, once there is a resolution, challenges arise that involve getting\non board with support for that decision and implementing it even if people\nstill personally disagree with it. In my early days at Red Hat, I struggled\nwhen I heard how people continued to voice their disagreement with a decision\nwe made, even after many of us had already moved on. I still struggle with it.\nThat kind of dynamic is unfathomable in a more conventional organization. Most\npeople would rather say, “I’m on board” with the decision, even if they\naren’t. That doesn’t happen at Red Hat—people tell you what they think—which\ncan really cut in two directions when you’re trying to get something\naccomplished.\n\nWhen you add up challenges like these, you can see how difficult it is to not\njust throw up your hands occasionally and say, “Just do it. I am the CEO and\nI’m telling you that I want this order followed.” Admittedly, this kind of\nthing still happens sometimes, especially with time-sensitive decisions\ninvolving regulations, budgets, or some such where we don’t have time to let\nthe debate flame out before we act. In 2008, as the Great Recession hit us, we\nneeded to reduce budgets without soliciting much input on how to do it. But\nwhen this does happen, most of our leaders do a pretty good job of saying, “I\nhear what you’re saying, and I agree, that aspect isn’t ideal. But for Red Hat\nright now, these other factors are outweighing that issue, and although I know\nthis isn’t the direction you want us to go in, it is what we’re going to do.\nAnd you might be right—I might be making a mistake here—but I’m the one who\nneeds to make this call, and if I’m wrong, we’ll circle back and figure out\nhow to correct it.”\n\nWe also understand that whenever we operate outside the lines in this way, it\ndamages our culture by some degree. It’s like walking through a bed of\nperennial flowers: you don’t always know what kind of subtle damage or change\nyou can bring about with just a single footstep. So while it might seem as if\nyou’re opening yourself up to more problems by working inclusively, at Red\nHat, we truly believe the benefits of facing challenges like these far\noutweigh the costs. It’s a balancing act that requires constant care and\nattention.\n\nIt remains important for us to embrace the notion of “on our best day,” where\nwe strive to operate on the key principles we espouse in running an open\norganization, while also knowing we aren’t perfect. We will stumble from time\nto time. But, in the end, Red Hat is a stronger organization as a result.\n\nJim’s Leadership Tips\n\n> 1.Find or create a venue in which to discuss areas where you would like to\n> see your team make progress.\n\n> 2.Tell your team members about a problem you are trying to solve.

I don’t\npretend to have developed a new management system, though I hope I have\ndescribed why a new one is needed. The only proof I can offer that the\nleadership culture we’ve built at Red Hat is effective and worth\nemulating—regardless of what kind of company you run—is our results. But I\nalso admit that since Red Hat operates on the bleeding edge of this new and\nbetter way to lead, we cut ourselves quite often as well.\n\nIn short, we’re still on a journey to find newer and better ways to build on\nthe lessons we’ve learned about what works, and what doesn’t, in building and\nleading participative communities.\n\nThe Boundaries of Participative Organizations\n\nWe know participative communities can build software. We see participative\ncommunities like Silicon Valley yield tremendous innovation, and efforts like\nWikipedia can collect vast amounts of disparate information. Few would doubt\nthe power of crowdsourcing to drive unique and elegant solutions to specific\nproblems. Conversely, it’s generally accepted that conventional hierarchies\nare typically miserable at driving innovation or sparking creativity. But\nthose same hierarchies do excel at maintaining control and coordinating\ndisparate activities like those involved in building complex machinery. Can\nparticipative organizations excel in these areas too? Put simply, could a\nloosely organized participative community build something as complicated as a\njetliner?\n\nThis question first arose in a conversation I had with Gary Hamel, who was one\nof the first people to recognize the need for an entirely new management\nsystem to meet the needs of the twenty-first century. We were discussing the\npower of participation as a management model. While we both agree that this\nnew system offers great potential in unlocking creativity and innovation, we\nwere debating whether it could match and replace conventional management for\npurposes of coordination and, if so, what its limits might be. We ended up\nusing the analogy of building a jetliner as our best example of a situation in\nwhich very tight coordination across literally millions of various systems and\nparts—the hallmark of a hierarchical system—is required. That question has\nbeen nagging me ever since.\n\nAirplanes are truly modern marvels of coordination on a massive scale. A well-\ndesigned airplane is the result of tens of thousands of small design trade-\noffs that are perfectly balanced and tightly managed. Hundreds of thousands of\ncomponents must come together with minute tolerances. A slight change to the\nwing design, intended to reduce wind drag just a bit, might require hundreds\nof additional changes, from the avionics to the landing gear. Every design\nchoice and change must be analyzed across the many thousands of interconnected\ncomponents. The end product is an engineering marvel of startling reliability.\nIndeed, the design and manufacture of an airplane represents the pinnacle of\nwhat modern coordination can produce.\n\nWhich brings me back to the question, can a bottom-up, participative system\ndevelop something as complex as a jetliner, considering the requirement for\nsuch close coordination among the various parts? When Hamel originally posed\nthis question to me, my knee-jerk answer was no. Building a plane is not what\nparticipative systems are good at. Upon further reflection, I would more\nclearly say, “In the very short term and in the strictest sense of the\nquestion, my answer is no.” While participative communities have shown an\namazing ability to develop highly complex systems, their power lies in the\ndistributed nature of the innovation process.\n\nThink about how Linux is created. Those closest to individual components are\nable to drive optimized solutions to those problems. In these self-emergent\nsystems, the underlying detail and complexity of the components can be far\nbeyond anything a top-down, centrally planned system can muster. However, if\nthose components must be tightly coordinated to work together, I’m not sure\nparticipative systems have a way to do that.\n\nBut the more I thought about the problem, the more I realized that it’s the\nwrong question. It is asking whether a participative system stuck into the\nmiddle of a conventional command-and-control ecosystem can outperform it. The\nright question to ask is, “Could an open ecosystem in aviation produce a\nsuperior aircraft over time?” And to that question, my answer is yes.\n\nThe power of participative systems and bottom-up innovation comes from having\nthose closest to the problems involved in solving them. Linux is successful\nnot because Linus Torvalds specified his requirements for each component, but\nrather because he did not. He allowed others with different skills and\nexpertise to drive the various components of the system, and ultimately the\nwhole has benefited. If the various parties involved in the myriad components\nof aviation—from the electronic navigation system to the landing gear—were\nallowed to drive their own designs forward, would the benefits of the superior\nindividual components offset the fact that they are not as tightly optimized\nto work together?\n\nFor many years, tightly coupled RISC/Unix systems represented the ultimate in\ncomputing performance. The idea was that, by producing both the hardware and\nthe software together, a vendor could produce the fastest computers. These\nsystems dominated high-end computing for years. Today, however, Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux, which is not designed for any particular hardware platform,\nruns over half the world’s equity trading volume—and those are systems bought\nfor performance, not price. Why?\n\nSimply, no single engineered process can keep up with the pace of change\ncapable in an open system, which can innovate faster because it is not\nencumbered with the need to coordinate across an entire system. Intel can run\nat its own pace, delivering the promise of Moore’s Law with chips of ever-\ngrowing complexity and performance. It can do this without worrying about the\nsoftware. Others are working globally to ensure the software continues to get\nfaster and more reliable. The fact that virtually all the top supercomputers\nworldwide are running a combination of Intel chips and Linux demonstrates the\npower of allowing specialized groups to focus on optimizing in their own\nsphere to create a better whole. An open system could not create the tightly\ncoupled, highly coordinated system that is a RISC/Unix computer. Instead, it\ncreated something better, faster, and cheaper.\n\nBut it did not happen overnight. A perennial garden takes years to reach\nmaturity; the same can be said for a participative ecosystem. It took over a\ndecade for the combination of x86 chips and Linux to surpass the power of\ntightly coordinated engineered systems. There are already open source projects\ntrying to build an airplane. They are starting small, but who knows where they\nmay be in a decade.\n\nI’m not yet advocating the complete demolition of the conventional\norganizational structure. At Red Hat, we continue to experiment with the\nboundaries of applying this new model to a public company. We use our\nparticipative culture to drive innovation and make decisions quickly, and we\nstill have people managers and senior leaders who play critical roles in\ncatalyzing the company’s direction, fostering participation, and driving its\npurpose and passion.\n\nWe are on a journey. I doubt anyone at Intel in the early days of the\nmicroprocessor would have imagined that its chips would run the world’s\nfastest computers. Nor did Linus Torvalds ever dream of the same. I firmly\nbelieve we are on a path toward a new, superior management paradigm. Red Hat\nis one of the companies on the bleeding edge of that journey, and I hope our\nlessons learned—both positive and negative—about driving the principles of an\nopen organization can help to catalyze the discussion.\n\nA Shared Challenge\n\nA key takeaway from this book is the notion that the Red Hat system—the way we\ngo about getting work done—is a crucial source of our competitive advantage.\nOur management system and organizational culture generate unique capabilities\nthat others simply cannot duplicate. In other words, our open organization is\nour competitive advantage. It’s how we have fended off much bigger rivals in\nthe past and how we plan to defend against them into the future.\n\nCapabilities like speed and agility, rather than physical assets, will become\neven more important components of every company’s competitive advantage in the\nfuture. But to capitalize on that advantage, you’ll need an open organization\nmanagement system capable of fueling those fires. We at Red Hat beat our\ncompetitors to market and react more quickly to threats and opportunities not\nbecause we pedal faster, but because the organization taps into powerful\nenergy sources like purpose, passion, and community that make it move faster.\n\nIt would have been easy for me to rely exclusively on examples from Red Hat\nfor this book. However, I purposely included a number of examples from Delta\nand other organizations like Whole Foods, W. L. Gore, and Zappos to\ndemonstrate that any kind of organization can benefit from these principles.\nMany conventional competitors will face an onslaught of new entrants into\ntheir markets; just look at how Amazon continues to expand into retail or how\nAirbnb has disrupted the hospitality industry. These new players are likely to\nhave a different, more modern organizational model driving their success.\nCompeting against them isn’t just about matching up your products in a market-\nbased chess game. It’s more about pitting organizational capabilities against\neach other. I hope this idea serves as food for thought for executives at both\nemerging businesses and established ones. To leaders at emerging companies,\nplease don’t assume that getting big means getting rigid and bureaucratic. To\nleaders in established companies, recognize that your organization’s\ncapabilities may become more important than your physical assets.\n\nThere’s No Going Back\n\nI have had the unique privilege to observe and learn this new management\nsystem up close. When I first joined Red Hat, I had my “conventional\norganization” filter on. I thought what I was seeing was simply chaos—the\nresult of not adopting the tried-and-true management practices used\nuniversally by conventional organizations. Over time, however, I began to\nappreciate the subtleties of what I now realize is a different management\nparadigm. I’ve had a chance to poke and prod and experiment. I’ve seen how the\nprinciples we rely on at Red Hat operate in the extreme within open source\ncommunities like Linux. There is still much to learn, and I am sure there is\nmuch to tweak in terms of perfecting how open organizations operate. But there\nis one certainty in my mind: I could never go back.\n\nEvery leader who takes on a new job must undergo his or her own personal\njourney. I have had the unique opportunity to join a company that was already\npracticing the principles of open organization. That’s been transformative for\nhow I think about what makes companies successful. Every company must have a\nhigher purpose, for example, and an enterprise can only exist and be\nprofitable if it is creating value for someone. An organization’s leaders have\nthe job of sharpening and clarifying that purpose in a way that ignites the\npassion of its members.\n\nTo fulfill that role, I’ve learned that the leaders of tomorrow must possess\ntraits that have largely been overlooked in conventional organizations. To\neffectively lead an open organization, a leader must possess the following\ntraits:\n\n> > Personal strength and confidence. Leaders in the conventional world\n> leverage their positional power—their titles—to get things done. But when\n> working in a meritocracy, leaders need to earn respect. They can only do\n> that if they have the confidence to admit they don’t have all the answers.\n> They must have a willingness to talk through problems and think on their\n> feet in order to reach the best conclusions with the help of their teams.\n\n> > Patience. The media rarely tell stories about how “patient” a leader is.\n> But they should. When you are working to get the best effort and results\n> from your team, to engage in dialogue for hours on end, and to do things\n> again and again until they’re done right, you need to have patience.\n\n> > High “EQ.” Too often we tout the intellectual capabilities of leaders by\n> focusing on their IQ, when we should really be valuing their emotional\n> intelligence quotient or EQ score. Being the smartest person in the room is\n> not enough if you don’t have the capacity to work with the people who are in\n> that room with you. When you work with and through communities of\n> contributors as Red Hat does, where you can’t order anyone to do anything\n> for you, your ability to listen, process, and not take everything personally\n> becomes incredibly valuable.\n\n> > A different mind-set. Leaders who have come up through conventional\n> organizations have been indoctrinated in a quid pro quo mind-set—one that’s\n> been influenced by math and hard science that says every action should\n> receive an appropriate response. But when you take a longer-term outlook to\n> investing in something like building a community, you need to think\n> differently. It’s like trying to build a delicately balanced ecosystem in\n> which any misstep you make can create imbalance and lead to long-term damage\n> that you may not see right away. Leaders must divest themselves of the mind-\n> set that requires them to achieve results today at all costs to one in which\n> the big payoffs come from delaying their sense of gratification and making\n> those investments in the future.\n\nOf course, making these kinds of changes won’t appeal to everyone. There are\ntimes when issuing a top-down edict, for instance, would be far easier than\nallowing the meritocracy to reach a solution on its own time. Why would you\nwant to open yourself up to criticism from your own troops? Wouldn’t your\nworkplace seem less chaotic and in control if you stuck with doing the things\nthe way you always have? To make this kind of culture work requires that\nleaders make an enormous investment in terms of time and energy, which can\nseem both daunting and wasteful. It’s almost like taking a leap of faith into\nthe unknown. How will you know that you and your organization will be able to\nreap positive rewards by going down the path I’ve described?\n\nThe answer comes back to the kind of competitive environment your organization\nfaces. If you feel extreme pressure to keep up with the rapid pace of your\nmarket and competitors, as we do at Red Hat, then I believe the investments\nyou make toward building an open organization will be paid back in spades.\nOnce you see the power of unlocking the full potential of the people you work\nwith, you simply can’t imagine going back. I am gratified to be part of a\nsystem that helps enable people to achieve their potential. It’s fun and\nexciting. Passion is contagious. I work to kindle it, but I am also consumed\nby the passion of others.\n\nAnother key lesson of this book is that the sense of pride I feel in what Red\nHat has accomplished actually has little to do with anything I have personally\naccomplished. Rather, I feel proud for what the people of Red Hat have done as\na direct result of my support for the system that enables them to achieve\ngreat things. This feeling is similar to how most people feel when their child\ngraduates from college; they feel prouder than they ever felt about their own\ngraduation. There is just something about seeing someone you care about and\nsupport step up and take the initiative to achieve something remarkable that\nis very powerful and, ultimately, gratifying. Watching the people around you\nblossom and reach their potential is so potent. When you allow everyone to do\nhis or her best, and are wise enough not to stick yourself in the middle and\nmuck things up, everybody wins.\n\nThis journey has been extraordinary for me. I’ve written this book about how\nthe new type of organization, the open organization, is more effective and\nmore capable. It’s also a story about my own deeply satisfying and gratifying\nexperience in learning how to lead such a workforce—something I couldn’t have\ndone without the help and feedback from everyone who works at Red Hat.\nStarting with my first interview up to today’s billion-dollar company, it’s\nbeen quite a ride—one I am thrilled to continue into the future. When I add\neverything up, it’s easy for me to reflect on the true pleasure of working at\nRed Hat.\n\nJoin Us on Our Journey\n\nGreat conversations are happening on [opensource.com](http://opensource.com),\nthe website we created to spark discussions about what is possible when you\nopen yourself to the possibilities of working in an open source way.\n\nThere is a case study on the site that specifically discusses how people are\nbuilding their versions of “makerplanes” by tapping into the collective wisdom\nand expertise of the community. No, they aren’t making jetliners . . . yet.\nBut I wouldn’t bet against them. This then raises the question, what else is\npossible when we put aside our conventional organizations and begin to tap\ninto the power of participative communities in all aspects of our lives and\nbusinesses? The potential is limitless, which is why I invite you to join us\non our journey by engaging in the discussions on\n[opensource.com](http://opensource.com).\n\nThere is a special page related to the themes of this book, and we encourage\nyou, in the spirit of letting the sparks fly, to share your thoughts and\nopinions with us on how you think we can all lead and work better in the\nfuture. We look forward to hearing from you there.\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nHow Does Red Hat Make Billions of Dollars Selling Free Software?\n\nPeople frequently ask me, “How does Red Hat make money selling free software?”\nThis question comes up so often that I can’t imagine not addressing it in this\nbook, even if it’s in an appendix. Let’s start with an analogy: why do people\nchoose to buy a bottle of water, when the same substance is freely available\nin most of the world? All you need to do is open a tap to get it, just as you\ncan go online and download, say, open source software code. Yet many people\nfind good reasons to pay several dollars for that bottle of water or sign up\nfor a delivery service: the convenience and portability of the bottle, the\nperceived safety of the water’s source, or even because people prefer the\ntaste compared to tap water. The buying decision comes down to choice and\nwhether the vendor is providing something of value to you.\n\nSimilarly, although it might appear that Red Hat’s business model is to sell\nsomething that is supposed to be free, our company actually is in the business\nof adding value to free code. Red Hat is an ever-growing collaboration of both\ninternal and external communities of contributors who update and improve\nsoftware by working together. While Red Hat first made its name in the\nsoftware world by working with the Linux operating system, which may be the\nmost widely used software technology in the entire computer industry, we now\ncollaborate with a multitude of other open source communities such as\nOpenStack, JBoss, GlusterFS, and Apache Camel in ways that provide value for\nour customers.\n\nFor our flagship product, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, for instance, we take the\nlatest version of Linux and dissect it so that we can test and document every\nmodification or bug-fix that has occurred since the last release. We certify\nit against the thousands of hardware and software programs that enterprises\ntypically use, so they can confidently implement Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nwithout worrying about if or how it will work with the myriad other components\nof their data center. In addition, we have a dedicated security response team\nto identify, patch, and distribute fixes for malware. Unfortunately, the\ninternet is making the “pipes and sewers” of computing as risky as drinking\nfrom a pool of water in the middle of a swamp. Our “bottled open source”\nsolutions provide security that simply cannot be achieved otherwise. In short,\nwe sell our customers peace of mind that their entire system is the most\nstable and secure system possible on the planet. That’s something they’re\nwilling to pay us for.\n\nLearning from Linux\n\nWe alone don’t do all the work that our customers benefit from. We work as\npart of an open source community, which is much more powerful at delivering\nresults than any one single siloed organization can.\n\nConsider how the dynamics of the Linux community, of which Red Hat is part,\noperates. Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 (he famously kicked off with a\nlistserv note that read: “Hello everybody out there . . . I’m doing a [free]\noperating system . . . just a hobby, nothing professional . . .”), Linux now\nruns everything from the most extreme scientific computers to web servers,\nnetwork devices, point of sale systems, military systems, cameras,\nautomobiles, and mobile devices. If you’re using an Android phone, you’re\nusing Linux.\n\nThe Linux story is fascinating from an organizational management perspective\nprecisely because it involves a system in which literally thousands of people,\nincluding many Red Hatters, self-organize and take direction from informal\nleaders who emerge based on the quality of contributions they have made over\ntime—which some community members have come to refer to as a “mega-self-\norganizing collective.” The Linux source code itself, some 30 million lines of\nprogramming instructions, is accessible to just about everyone out there;\nhence, the term “open source.” To create this code, community members came\ntogether in a decentralized manner, rather than working through a conventional\ntop-down hierarchy, where higher-ups issued orders that were fulfilled by\nprogrammers at the lower rungs.\n\nI am constantly amazed at the effectiveness of this self-organizing, opt-in,\nglobal community that we contribute to. This virtual army fixes bugs, heads\noff malevolent hackers, and collaborates on making Linux a stronger product\nthan it would be if just a single entity tried to control it, which many\npeople once thought was the only way to build software. Linux is modular\nenough to run things as diverse as refrigerators to smart phones to mainframe\ncomputers. It’s precise enough to run some of the most mission-critical\nsystems in the world, including stock exchanges and nuclear submarines. And\nit’s scalable enough to run Google’s infrastructure. The Linux community also\nreacts at amazing speed. Everything from security issues, when they arise, to\nbreakthrough enhancements are typically addressed within hours or minutes.\n\nFor example, the US Navy, one of our customers, came to us with a major\nproblem. Events in recent conflicts had proven that smaller boats armed with\nmissiles posed a serious threat to the larger ships like aircraft carriers.\nThe navy wanted to develop antimissile systems that could react in real time\nto those kinds of threats. The problem is that most operating systems don’t\nwork in real time. Think about the last time you were typing a document or\nworking on a spreadsheet and your computer paused or experienced some kind of\ndelay. That was because your operating system was working on other things in\nthe background. While that’s fine for most of us, the navy clearly needed\nsomething better.\n\nBut rather than trying to come up with its own solution, the navy came to Red\nHat and the Linux community for help in building a “real-time kernel” that\nwouldn’t experience those kinds of delays. We then helped catalyze the various\nLinux communities to tackle the project as something that everyone could\nbenefit from. What happened over the next eighteen months was that the\ncommunity worked together to create what the navy needed. But that same\ntechnology now used to help shoot down missiles is also used by stock\nexchanges to help ensure there is never any lag during the trading day. That’s\nbecause our community includes members from organizations like JPMorgan Chase\nand Goldman Sachs, which saw the value in this effort, and led to a way to\nsolve their problems. In other words, an open source community like Linux\nworks because its members both directly and indirectly benefit from the work\nthat they contribute.\n\nPeople invest their time in making Linux a better operating system because, by\nvirtue of making computing safer, faster, and more open, they feel as if they\nmake the world a better place. It’s that compelling purpose that brings so\nmany people together to work on Linux and other open source projects. Not just\nprogrammers, but also writers, testers, marketers, designers, and\nadministrators contribute their combined efforts to create something no one\ntraditional organization could do on its own. One study estimated, for\ninstance, that if you started from scratch, it would take about eight thousand\nyears of development time to recreate Linux, at a reported cost of more than\n$10 billion.[1](index_split_019.html#filepos433148) That’s powerful stuff.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Community\n\nThe Linux story helps explain why we at Red Hat have come to appreciate that\nthe open source development model is incredibly powerful at delivering\ninnovation at a faster and less costly rate than the traditional software\ndevelopment model. And as Linux has evolved, so, too, has Red Hat.\n\nIn 1998, Red Hat had seventy-five associates and was earning $10 million in\nyearly sales, mostly from shipping Linux on CD-ROMs and selling T-shirts.\nPeople paid Red Hat for a version of Linux so they could get access to\ndocumentation and support. While Red Hat experienced a highly successful\ninitial public offering in August 1999 using that business model, the dot-com\ncrash almost brought the company down with it. The company’s stock, which\ntraded as high as $286 a share in December 1999 (leading to an eye-popping\nvaluation of about $19.7 billion), had cratered to about $3.50 by 2001 as the\ncompany continued to hemorrhage cash and struggled to grow revenue. That meant\nthat if Red Hat was going to survive, it needed to evolve its business model\nto become profitable—fast. That was especially true because Red Hat competed\nagainst some of the mightiest tech companies around, a few of whom were\nextremely vocal in their derision of a business model they called “communist.”\nAs Bill Gates, former CEO of Microsoft, told the press back in 2001, “We think\nof Linux as a competitor in the student and hobbyist market but I really don’t\nthink in the commercial market we’ll see it in any significant\nway.”[2](index_split_019.html#filepos433666)\n\nUnlike other business stories, which involve heroic CEOs riding to the rescue,\nRed Hat’s turnaround came from within. A collection of engineers,\nbusinesspeople, and lawyers identified as “the smartest people in the\ncompany,” according to Mike Evans, Red Hat’s vice president of business\ndevelopment, helped the fledgling company pivot its early business model.\nAfter debating several options, including some that would make Red Hat’s\nsoftware proprietary, the team came up with the idea to completely shift focus\nfrom the desktop to the enterprise server—a key turning point in Red Hat\nhistory, though not a popular decision at the time. In fact, Paul Cormier (now\nRed Hat’s president of products and technologies), a key architect of the now\npowerful “enterprise open source” business model, received a “does not meet\nexpectations” for his performance review in the year that he developed the\nbusiness model. (He’s obviously more than met expectations in the subsequent\ndecade.)\n\nBut when Red Hat shifted its focus to the enterprise IT market, it dawned on\nfolks like Cormier that as powerful as open source is at solving problems, it\ncan also create quite a few issues for companies as well. For example, open\nsource development breaks down problems into smaller chunks that groups work\non, which results in the frequent and early release of software that can be\nproblematic for companies needing stability perhaps more than rapid change.\nAnd unlike traditional software with long release cycles, developers don’t fix\nbugs in older versions of code. They simply fix those problems in their next\nrelease, which again creates issues that affect applications for many years.\nThe fast-moving, modular approach to writing software has many advantages over\nthe traditional software development model, but it does not make it easy to\nuse for running large, mission-critical applications liking billing systems or\ntrading platforms that require absolute stability and as little change as\npossible.\n\nIf you’re running, say, a stock exchange, you need to know that any updates to\nyour software won’t crash the entire system. Or, if you run several kinds of\nhardware in your business, you need to know for certain that the latest\nsoftware update will run equally well on all of your machines or it simply\nwon’t be valuable to your business. Red Hat steps in to stabilize the software\nwhile providing support and documentation. When we “freeze the spec,” as it’s\ncalled, Red Hat is actually making a significant investment in that we\ndedicate several hundred engineers to supporting each version of Linux for the\nnext ten years. As changes occur upstream in the Linux community, our team\nwill be working to create patches to the older versions of the code that our\ncustomers are running in a way that keeps their business running smoothly. Put\nanother way, we generate our revenues by making open source software\nconsumable, and safe, for enterprises to adopt.\n\nBy investing in tech labs of our own, not to mention the kind of top talent\nneeded to run that kind of support backbone, Red Hat is able to provide value\nto our customers through services they pay for on a subscription basis. One of\nthe real values that Red Hat delivers through its subscription model is that\nwe don’t have any built-in incentives to deliver software to our customers\nthat they don’t want or need. When you buy a Red Hat product, you are buying\nthe support and value-added infrastructure for whatever product you buy\nwithout any hidden incentives to add new code and features—known as software\nbloat—that you didn’t ask for.\n\nIn short, by providing these services to our customers, and actively\ncontributing and giving back to the open source communities that make\neverything possible, we’re able to make billions of dollars selling free\nsoftware. We’re proud of that because we feel that our customers are receiving\nan incredible value compared to proprietary alternatives. Since the code\nitself is free, our customers pay only for the added value we provide. That\nmeans that customers not only reap the benefits of the innovative capabilities\nof the code created by open source communities, but also get the stability and\nsecurity they need, all for about one-tenth the price of what our competitors\noffer. That’s why it’s easy to see that the future of software is all about\nthe open source way.\n\n\nNOTES\n\nChapter 1\n\n[1](index_split_007.html#filepos31197).

I wrote this book to describe the amazing management system that they,\nnot I, have created at Red Hat. This book is a tribute to all of their hard\nwork and risk taking in bucking the traditional rules of business and creating\na new way to organize and get work done that I continue to learn and grow from\nevery day.\n\nI have also had the benefit of standing on the shoulders of giants. I have\nlearned so much in following what Red Hat’s founders, Bob Young and Marc\nEwing, put in motion. That’s also true of the leadership of Matthew Szulik, my\npredecessor, who drove the company forward and continued to scale our culture.\nI owe a deep debt of gratitude as well to my senior management team—Charlie\nPeters, executive vice president and CFO; DeLisa Alexander, executive vice\npresident and chief people officer; Jackie Yeaney, executive vice president,\nstrategy and corporate marketing; Michael Cunningham, executive vice president\nand general counsel; Arun Oberoi, executive vice president, global sales and\nservices; and Paul Cormier, executive vice president and president, products\nand technologies—which has remained remarkably intact since the day I started.\nBut that’s not to diminish the great work done by Brian Stevens and Alex\nPinchev in their time with Red Hat as well. Most of my team has been together\nat Red Hat for more than a decade, and they have been instrumental in shaping\nour company’s strategy, business model, and culture.\n\nWriting a book is truly a team effort. Many Red Hatters worked to make this\nbook a reality. In particular, I want to thank Leigh Day, Stephanie\nWonderlick, and Emily Stancil Martinez, who first had the idea for a book on\nRed Hat’s unique model for getting things done. I also want to thank Rebecca\nFernandez, Máirín Duffy, Thomas Cameron, Jeff Mackanic, Kim Jokisch, and Laura\nHamlyn for their time, perspective, and keen memory of many great Red Hat\nstories. Without your support and encouragement, and in the case of Emily,\ncontinuous prodding, this book would literally never have been written. Much\ncredit must go to my assistant Andrea Ferrara, who has been with me since my\ndays at The Boston Consulting Group. Without her stern management of my\ncalendar, this book would never have happened.\n\nI want to thank Darren Dahl, who collaborated with me on this effort. He feels\nmore and more like a Red Hatter every day and continuously pushed my own\nthinking and understanding of what makes Red Hat such a great place. It’s been\na great partnership, and I will miss the many hours we spent together crafting\nthe stories and messages in this book. Thanks also to our agent, Esmond\nHarmsworth, who has one of the best names in the literary world, and Melinda\nMerino, our editor at Harvard Business Review Press, and the entire HBR team\nfor believing in our message and helping us share it with the world.\n\nI would like to thank Gary Hamel for his thought leadership on this topic. His\nbook The Future of Management remains the best articulation of the need for a\nnew management paradigm. He has been a great thought partner for me, and I\nalso thank him for his excellent and provocative foreword to this book.\n\nMost importantly, I’d like to thank my wife, Lauren, and our fantastic twins,\nJack and Emma, for their support and understanding. Lauren has been my thought\npartner not only for this book, but in all aspects of my business career and\nlife for more than two decades. I would not be where I am without her. I\nespecially thank my family for understanding when, even after I’ve been away\non a long business trip overseas, I’ve had to lock myself away with the\ncomputer to work on the words within these pages. And finally my mother, who\nmay have been my harshest copy editor, but also the person who has enabled all\nof my successes in life.\n\nIt’s truly been a team effort, and this book, like the work we do every day,\nwas the product of an open and collaborative effort that is far stronger than\nanything I could have done on my own.\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJIM WHITEHURST is president and chief executive officer of Red Hat, the\nworld’s leading provider of open source enterprise IT products and services.\nWith a background in business development, finance, and global operations,\nWhitehurst has proven expertise in helping companies flourish—even in the most\nchallenging economic and business environments. Since joining Red Hat in 2008,\nWhitehurst has grown the company, and its influence in a variety of\nindustries, by reaching key milestones—the most notable in 2012 when Red Hat\nbecame the first $1 billion revenue open source software company.\n\nUnder Whitehurst’s leadership, Red Hat has been recognized on Forbes’s\n“Fastest-Growing Technology Companies” list in 2011, ranked seventh on\nInvestor’s Business Daily’s “Top 10 New American Companies” list in 2011, and\nranked on Forbes’s list of “The World’s Most Innovative Companies” in 2012 and\n2014. Red Hat was selected for inclusion in the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500\nstock index in 2009, and named by Glassdoor in 2014 as one of the best places\nto work.\n\nRed Hat’s product portfolio has expanded through several strategic\nacquisitions since Whitehurst joined the company, including Qumranet, Inc.\n(virtualization), Makara (Platform-as-a-Service [PaaS]), Gluster (storage),\nFuseSource (middleware), Polymita (middleware), ManageIQ (cloud management),\nInktank (storage), eNovance (OpenStack), and FeedHenry (middleware). By\nincorporating these technologies, Red Hat has become the only open source\ncompany that can offer an open source cloud stack that includes an operating\nsystem, middleware, and virtualization. The company also revealed its open\nhybrid cloud technology vision for the future of IT, including plans for\nbuilding and managing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and PaaS public and\nprivate clouds.\n\nAs its portfolio grows, Red Hat continues to influence the future of\ntechnology by supporting open source projects like OpenStack, Fedora, and\nGlusterFS, and by defending patent law legislation, including amicus\nsubmissions to the US Supreme Court. Open Source for America, a coalition\nadvocating for open source software in government, also launched in 2009, with\nRed Hat as a founding member. In 2010, Red Hat unveiled\n[opensource.com](http://opensource.com), a website that explores the role of\nopen source in business, government, law, and life, and brings the open source\nmessage to a much broader audience.\n\nWhitehurst continues to advocate for open, nonproprietary data and technology.\nHe speaks at conferences throughout the world and at top research\nuniversities, including Harvard Business School, Duke University, and the\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Whitehurst is often asked to\nappear as a guest on CNBC, Bloomberg, and Fox Business.\n\nWhitehurst began his career in 1989 at The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in\nChicago and held several corporate development leadership roles at the firm.\nOver the next decade, he worked in BCG’s Chicago, Hong Kong, and Shanghai\noffices and as a partner in the Atlanta office, with numerous clients across a\nwide range of industries. He was named partner at BCG in 2000.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, the Delta Air Lines leadership team asked Whitehurst to\nserve as its acting treasurer. That same week, he led the company’s secured\ndebt offering, winning the Thomson-IVR “Deal of the Year” for reopening the\ncapital markets. In 2002, he joined Delta Air Lines full-time as senior vice\npresident–finance, treasury, and business development. He was promoted again\nin 2004 to chief network and planning officer, a position from which he drove\nsignificant international expansion. He was named chief operating officer in\n2005, overseeing all aspects of airline operations, including sales,\nmarketing, operations, and strategy.\n\nWhitehurst graduated from Rice University in Houston, Texas, in 1989 with a\nbachelor of arts degree in economics and computer science. He also attended\nFredrick Alexander University in Erlangen, Germany, and holds a general course\ndegree from the London School of Economics. He earned his MBA from Harvard in\n1994. In 2007, while COO of Delta Air Lines, Whitehurst was nominated as a\nYoung Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. In March 2014, he was honored\nwith the William C. Friday Award, an annual award presented by the senior\nclass of Park Scholars, North Carolina State University’s merit scholarship\nprogram, honoring Friday’s dedication and excellence in leadership,\nscholarship, service, and character.\n\nWhitehurst lives in Durham, North Carolina, with his wife and twins. He is a\nmember of the board of directors of DigitalGlobe, Inc., Duke University Health\nSystem, and The Conservation Fund. He also sits on the executive committee of\nthe North Carolina Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n[Title Page](index_split_002.html#filepos4427)\n\n[Copyright Page](index_split_003.html#filepos5082)\n\n[Dedication](index_split_004.html#filepos8204)\n\n[Contents](index_split_005.html#filepos8467)\n\n[Foreword](index_split_006.html#filepos11461)\n\n> > [1\\.
