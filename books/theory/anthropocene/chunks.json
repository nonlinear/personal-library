Franklin, _The Real World of Technology_\n\n\n# One\n\n# Behind the Lights\n\nOn a rainy Mother’s Day in 2002, along with two hundred thousand other people,\nI went for a walk on a brand-new bridge.\n\nThe Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge in Boston is brilliant white,\nall soaring towers and parallel lines, echoing a nearby obelisk and evoking a\nship under full sail. It’s one of the world’s widest cable-stayed bridges, and\nits roadbed carries ten lanes of Interstate 93 traffic over the Charles River\nbefore diving under the peninsula of the downtown core. A few weeks before it\nwas opened to cars, local residents were invited to cross it on foot. And we\ncame, five times as many visitors as were expected, despite the weather. My\nfriend and I waited for hours, huddled under our umbrellas, before we finally\nmade it onto the bridge. We craned our necks to drink it all in, knowing it\nwas almost certainly the one and only time we would get to traverse it at our\nown speed and under our own power.\n\nIn retrospect, the organizers probably shouldn’t have been quite so surprised\nat the demand. In 1987, when the Golden Gate Bridge was fully opened to\npedestrians to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary, nearly three hundred\nthousand people were on the deck—more weight than bumper-to-bumper traffic—and\nthe organizers had to turn away another half a million. Conservation\nbiologists sometimes refer to animals like pandas, elephants, and polar bears\nas “charismatic megafauna.” Large, easily recognizable, and beloved, they make\nexcellent spokescreatures for wildlife and for their homes. All over the\nworld, charismatic megastructures are the public faces of our collective\ninfrastructural systems. Bridges, of course, but also the soaring spaces of\nrailway stations, from Grand Central Terminal in New York City to the\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in Mumbai. In my hometown of Toronto, the\nCN Tower, built to be a communications hub, makes the skyline instantly\nrecognizable. The Hoover Dam, in the desert outside Las Vegas, hosts seven\nmillion visitors every year. We _love_ our charismatic megastructures. Their\nsize and complexity might inspire awe, but I think it also has to do with the\nway that we feel like they belong to all of us, not individually but together,\nin much the same way as cathedrals and other sacred spaces. Not for nothing\ndid Joan Didion describe driving on Los Angeles highways as a “secular\ncommunion.”\n\nYears after I dragged my friend out in the rain with me to walk on the Zakim\nBridge, my nephews came to visit and we took an amphibious boat tour of the\ncity. The guide told us about that one, now-legendary day in May when the\nbridge was open to pedestrians. I remember, I told them. I was there. My\nfamily was unsurprised, because they know I’ve been fascinated by science and\nengineering my entire life. The first thing I ever remember wanting to be as a\nkid was an astronaut—it was the 1970s, the cultural peak of space exploration.\nBy the time I was ten, I wanted to be a nuclear physicist, and this took me\nall the way through to a degree in engineering physics. Like many women of my\ngeneration who went into the field, I had a role model close by, my father.\nHe’d grown up and earned a degree in electrical engineering in a newly\nindependent India before deciding he wanted to see more of the world. In the\nlate 1960s, Canada, like the U.S., was opening its doors to non-European\nimmigrants. My father enrolled in an MBA program at the University of Alberta\nand when he graduated, he took a job with Ontario Hydro, the public electrical\nutility for the province. His young family moved to the outskirts of Toronto\nand he started work at the place where he would eventually spend his entire\nprofessional career. A few months later, I was born. And a few months after\nthat, in the next town over, one of the first large-scale nuclear power\nstations in Canada came online. I grew up on a street that ran down to a sandy\nbeach on Lake Ontario, and when we picnicked and played in the water, the\nplant was easily visible, eight imposing gray concrete domes and a single\nmassive cylindrical structure on the shoreline. Behind the facility, rows of\nelectrical transmission towers marched along a wide, green right-of-way, first\nthrough the nearby suburban housing and then all over the city and region.\nBest of all, for my tech-obsessed childhood self, they had a visitor center\nwith a nuclear power–themed interactive science museum. In my memory, it’s all\nbuttons and flashing lights, with cutaway models explaining the different\nsystems and a walk-through mock-up of the reactor core. The Pickering Nuclear\nGenerating Station was my local, personal charismatic megastructure. When I\nhad to give a five-minute speech to my sixth-grade class at school, my topic\nwas obvious: my fellow students got a lecture about the CANDU (CANadian\nDeuterium Uranium) reactors at our local power station, illustrated with a set\nof overhead transparencies my dad had brought home from work.\n\nScientists and engineers have a concept of _elegance_ , which is among the\nhighest praise that can be given to a theory, a proof, or a device. It’s hard\nto explain exactly what it is, but it incorporates ideas of efficiency or\nparsimony—accomplishing something with a minimum of effort, energy, or\nmaterials. Elegance in engineering often encompasses the surprising and very\nparticular use of the specific resources that are available. Beauty might be\npart of it, but mostly as something inherent in the design, and the skill and\ncare of its manufacture is part of it too. For example, the graceful curves of\nsuspension bridges, like the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate, derive from\nthe way that cables are shaped by gravity as they bear the weight of the\nroadbed below. My local power station probably wouldn’t be described as\nbeautiful, but what was going on inside possessed undeniable engineering\nelegance. The reactor systems are carefully designed to produce and control\nthe nuclear reactions that create heat, turning water into the pressurized\nsteam which spins turbines and generates electricity. The CANDU design uses\ndeuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, in the form of naturally occurring heavy\nwater that’s been purified out from ordinary water. It plays a safety-\nconscious dual role: the heavy water bathes the reactor core, supporting the\nnuclear reactions and also serving as a coolant. Because the reactor needs the\ndeuterium to remain critical, a leak means that the core will fizzle out\ninstead of overheating. What’s more, the deuterium is so effective at\nsustaining nuclear fission that the uranium fuel only needs to be lightly\nenriched. That makes it easier and less dangerous to produce than other\nreactor fuels, and it’s also much less amenable to being repurposed to make\nnuclear weapons.\n\nOf course, as a kid I didn’t think about any of the larger issues like\nlimiting the risk of nuclear isotopes falling into the wrong hands or ways to\ndeal with the long-term storage of radioactive waste. But even then, years\nbefore I took my first physics or engineering course, I could recognize the\nelegance and utility of the reactor design and how it made the most of what\nwas available, whether that was locally mined uranium in the reactor core or\nfrigid water from the depths of Lake Ontario for cooling. Today, I recognize\nthis same elegance all over the world and across infrastructural systems, in a\ngiant battery in Wales that’s constructed from two lakes and the mountain\nbetween them and in the modular design of a solar plant outside Hyderabad,\nIndia. That elegance is a hallmark of infrastructure because these systems are\nalmost always designed around the effective use of resources—above all, the\nuse of energy. For most of human history, access to energy has enabled or\nlimited what’s possible. Harnessing and delivering energy, efficiently and at\nscale, has long been one of the main drivers for why and how societies have\nbuilt out collective infrastructural systems.\n\nThe Zakim Bridge became an iconic part of the Boston skyline as soon as it was\nconstructed. There are practical reasons for it to be such a dramatic\nstructure—instead of being built on piers, it’s a cable-stayed design, which\nlimits its impact on the Charles River below—but surely it was also so that a\nmonumental effort to make something _less_ visible would be recognized and\nvalued. The bridge was built as part of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project,\nbetter known as the Big Dig, the decades-long, multibillion-dollar project in\nwhich the elevated expressway that carried Interstate 93 across downtown\nBoston was torn down and the highway was buried underground. Elephants,\nwhales, and other charismatic megafauna help us to see and appreciate entire\necosystems, including all of the unregarded but critically important species,\nlike tiny insects and nondescript flora. Charismatic megastructures can\nsimilarly help us see and appreciate whole infrastructural systems, even the\nparts that are buried or hidden. And while I might have started with my\nmassive local nuclear power plant, I began to realize that I could see and\nlearn from the tiniest parts of these networks too.\n\n## Seeing Beneath the Surface\n\nThe Old State House in downtown Boston was built in 1713, making it one of the\noldest public buildings in the city. I must have walked past it dozens of\ntimes before my eye was caught by the bronze glint of a benchmark sunk into\nthe granite steps of a side door. It’s a medallion, a few inches in diameter,\nwith markings that indicate that it was placed by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic\nSurvey to serve as a reference point for mapping. I had to kneel and look\ncarefully at its worn face in order to make out the date: 1936. Similar survey\nmarkers can be found all over the world—I once startled a friend by spotting a\ntiny red marker, labeled cadastre, as I was stepping off a curb in Lausanne,\nSwitzerland (it would have been used to create a cadastral map, an\nadministrative record of all the real estate in the country). A few years ago,\nI went to the southern end of Central Park to find a small, anonymous steel\nrod sunk into a granite boulder. It was a Randel bolt, one of the markers that\nwere used to lay out the original grid pattern of Manhattan streets at the\nstart of the nineteenth century. On the modern suburban campus where I teach\nengineering, there’s a small, bright blue metal pin embedded into a pathway to\nmark where a nineteenth-century aqueduct passes under the athletic fields. In\nurban centers, cryptic symbols spray-painted onto the pavement tell utility\nworkers where to dig and what they’ll find when they do, in much the same way\ndoctors use surgical markers to make notations on patients before making the\nfirst incision in an operation. Boston is one of a number of cities that uses\nrepair tags, plastic disks that are labeled with the name of the utility\ncompany and a reference number. They’re embedded into asphalt repair patch\nafter work is complete in order to let the next work crew know that something\nhas changed. On unpaved ground, I’ve spotted flags or feathery bundles of\ncolored plastic fiber used to mark where gas and water lines lie below the\ndirt. The bright colors aren’t just for visibility. They’re a code: in most of\nthe U.S., blue is used for potable water, green for sewage and runoff, red for\nelectricity, orange for communications, and yellow for natural gas, with hot\npink used for temporary markings.\n\nAt any given moment, there is almost certainly some element of some\ninfrastructural system in my field of view. Indoors, I can look around to see\nelectrical lights and outlets, and usually there’s a heating vent, and maybe a\nfaucet or a drain. A few tiny curved lines in the corner of my laptop screen\nor straight lines on my phone tell me I’m on a global telecommunications\nnetwork. Outdoors, there’s almost certainly a nearby road, or at least a\nfootpath that connects to one. But seeing isn’t perceiving—just because\nsomething is in our field of view doesn’t mean that we consciously register\nit, much less understand what we’re looking at. Humans are disturbingly good\nat filtering out anything in our vision that we’re either accustomed to seeing\nor which doesn’t appear meaningful. Charismatic megastructures\nnotwithstanding, many of the visible parts of infrastructural systems fall\ninto this perceptual chasm. Between their familiarity and their unannounced,\nunexplained presence, infrastructural systems are easy to see but just as easy\nto ignore, unless we bring our conscious attention to bear on them.\n\nOnce we do, we begin to see that we are surrounded by networks, made visible\nnot just by colorful squiggles but by sewer grates, telephone poles,\nmailboxes, access covers, transformer boxes, fire hydrants, railway lines, and\non and on and on. The contrail of a jet airplane makes the invisible air\ntravel corridors in the sky above us temporarily visible, just as spray paint\ndoes for underground ducts. Survey markers and street signs remind us that all\nof these networks were made possible by the centuries-long project of\nmeasuring the world, first with maps, then with clocks, and now with modern\nsatellite mapping, which entangles the two. Even if the networks themselves\nare buried or intangible, we can visualize them by connecting the traces that\nwe can see, knitting together people, buildings, and the world around us, in\nour home neighborhood or across the planet.\n\nThese visible markers show us not only the extent of these networks in space\nbut also how they extend through _time_. Every marker, whether it’s an\nimposing monument or a scrap of fabric, is there to send a message from the\npast to the future. Infrastructural networks are enduring, and that endurance\nshapes the way that new systems build on top of—or underneath, or\nalongside—the older ones. Water mains and gas pipes run along and beneath\nroads. Train tracks often followed watercourses as a path of least resistance\nthrough the terrain, telegraph lines were sent alongside the rails, and then\nroads were built along the same path, and electrical wires strung, and\ntelephone cables. Because these networks are so important to the ways we do\nthings, they have unparalleled continuity. We almost never rip them out and\nstart over from scratch. Instead, infrastructural systems are repaired or\nrebuilt in modular increments, like steadily working through the replacement\nof water mains in a neighborhood or fixing potholes every spring. But that\ncontinuity has a flip side: it locks us into these ways of doing things. The\nQWERTY keyboard layout was designed to keep fast typists from jamming the keys\non manual typewriters, but it’s still in use on smartphone touchscreens.\nDecisions made decades or even centuries ago—how we treat wastewater, the use\nof alternating current instead of direct current for electricity grids,\npipelines laid for fossil fuels—all of these shape not just the technologies\nand systems in use today but those that haven’t yet been built. That\ncontinuity means there’s a path dependence—that the kinds of systems we have\ntoday depend on the characteristics of the systems that came before—in\naddition to growth and accumulation, as these systems build on each other. We\nnow live surrounded by technological systems of nearly unimaginable scale,\nextent, and complexity.\n\n## Landscapes and Cloudscapes\n\nMy family’s immigration story is intertwined with the rise of global civil\naviation, and so my childhood was one of transcontinental flights to India to\nvisit extended family. Even after a lifetime of flying, it’s still a thrill\nfor me to get on a plane, to feel the press of acceleration during takeoff and\nthe lift as the wheels release their contact with the ground, and to gaze out\nof the window for hours, at the sky or the landscape or the ocean below. Air\ntravel has never become mundane to me, not least because once I think about\nwhat’s happening, it’s a _lot_. First of all, there’s the sheer improbability\nof being in a vehicle that weighs hundreds of tons and is somehow still miles\nabove the ground, airborne only by virtue of its tremendous forward speed.\nAlong with this is understanding that it’s because of the expertise of the\npilots and the continued functioning of the massive jet engines, along with\nthe systems that connect them to the control surfaces of the plane, to say\nnothing of the ones that keep the cabin comfortable in the face of the killing\ncold and the suffocating absence of air just on the other side of the\nporthole, a few inches from my face.\n\nThose are just the most obvious, visible parts. When we’re over the middle of\nthe Atlantic, quietly seated, or asleep or watching a movie, we’re all\ncomfortable and the engines continue to roar quietly because of everything\nthat happened before we boarded: the inspection, maintenance, and repair of\nthe plane, and its provisioning with supplies, from aviation kerosene to\ntoilet paper. And behind that, all of the standards, regulations, and\ncertifications, everything from the fire resistance of seat fabric to the\nrules around how many hours the flight crew can work, from how and when to\nfile a flight plan to the pictographs in the toilet. Then beyond _that_ , an\nentire international system of atomic clocks and satellites so that all the\nplanes in flight can agree on exactly what time it is and where they are, as\nwell as the global network of weather sensors and prediction. Very few of\nthese technologies and systems even existed a century ago, and now they’re far\ntoo complex for a single mind to grasp.\n\nCarl Sagan famously said, “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch,\nfirst you must invent the universe.” Ever since I was a kid, whenever I find\nmyself someplace far from city lights on a clear night, I take some time and\nstare up at the stars. It reminds me that we’re all whirling through space,\nand that everything I can see in the sky will continue to move along its own\npath regardless of anything that happens on our planet. Sometimes it can feel\nlike cosmic vertigo, but I mostly find the vastness and indifference of the\nuniverse strangely reassuring. Because if you wish to drink a Bloody Mary and\nwatch a movie as you fly somewhere for a vacation, first you must invent an\nunutterably and increasingly complex international system that’s not just\ntechnological but social and political and regulatory, in order to make an\nintercontinental flight safe and even mundane. When I think too hard about air\ntravel, I can give myself the same vertiginous feeling I get when I stare up\ninto a starry sky, but I find being enfolded in these global systems similarly\nreassuring. It’s helped by the ordinary human reassurance that comes from\nobserving or interacting with professionals working with competence and care.\nIt’s part of why I like it when planes have an in-flight channel for the radio\nchatter from the cockpit.\n\nBut here’s the kicker—or rather, two kickers. One is that, unlike the stars,\nthe systems that enable my transatlantic flights are _human_ systems, created\nand sustained by and for humans. They were designed and built to get at a\ncertain set of outcomes—safe air travel, for sure, but also profits for\nairlines, or to bolster national pride, or to provide mobility options for\nresidents of that country, or other reasons. The other kicker is that even if\nyou’re firmly on the ground, if you’re reading these words, you are almost\ncertainly still enmeshed in modern globe-spanning technological systems that\nhave at least as much scale and complexity as civil aviation. The last half\ncentury or so has seen the rise of planetary networks not just for the\nmovement of people but also of goods, in the form of supply chains enabled by\nthe standardized shipping container, and of information, enabled by modern\ntelecommunications. The growth in scale and extent of these systems have been\nin parallel with a steady increase in technological complexity, present not\nonly in the obvious examples like computers but also in seemingly simple\nartifacts, like flimsy disposable plastic shopping bags. Whether it’s a\ntelephone or a T-shirt, most modern goods are made possible by cooperation and\nstandards, the products of humans working together to make use of technologies\nthat no one person can understand in their entirety. Every light switch\nconnects to a system that’s just as complicated as civil aviation and just as\nmuch a human creation full of human actors, as dependent on schedules, maps,\nstandards, and regulations. The electrical grid, municipal water supplies,\nwaste treatment facilities, motorized transport, food production systems,\nfossil fuel distribution, telecommunications—these technologies and networks\nunderpin every aspect of the lives of a large fraction of the humans on the\nplanet, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n## The Systems of the World\n\nI’ve referred to a number of different systems, individually and collectively,\nas infrastructure. We can certainly intuit that they have something in common,\nso that it makes sense to group them together, but it’s hard to articulate\nexactly what that is. What makes infrastructure, infrastructure?\n\n“All of the stuff that you don’t think about” turns out to be a surprisingly\ngood starting point. For something to be considered infrastructure, its\npresence and characteristics are taken as a given. My bedside lamp needs\nelectricity to function, and it plugs into an outlet, but I don’t have to\nthink much about the specific characteristics of the electricity: the voltage,\nthe current, the frequency. The washing machine I use for my clothes needs not\nonly electricity but also a supply of clean water. Some of that water comes\nfrom a hot-water heater, which itself relies on a piped-in supply of natural\ngas, and the dirty water drains into a sewage line. Four different\ninfrastructural systems converge when I do my laundry. My ability to take\nthese infrastructural systems for granted implies that there are underlying\nsocial agreements about what systems will be present and how they will\nfunction. They’re not the only systems like this in our lives. A monetary\nsystem is a social agreement that money has value and can be traded for useful\ngoods and services. A well-functioning legal system is a collective system\nthat, among other characteristics, allows strangers to enter into contracts\nwith confidence because all parties know that there are consequences for\nbreaking them.\n\nWhat electricity, water and sewage, telecommunications, and\ntransportation—these familiar infrastructural systems—also have in common with\neach other is that they’re technological systems. They’re rooted in physical\nphenomena—the characteristics and behavior of matter and energy—and so require\nsome kind of engineering to harness those phenomena. It might be as simple as\ndigging a ditch to channel water flowing downhill into a slightly different\ndirection, or it might be as complex as all the multitudinous technologies,\nfrom metallurgy to meteorology, that go into building a commercial jet plane\nand keeping it safely in the air. As an engineering professor, especially\ngiven my background in materials science, I have a deep awareness of how\ntechnologies are embedded in the physical world and how this makes\ninfrastructure different from legal or monetary systems. Buying a cup of\ncoffee might incorporate all sorts of technologies, from papermaking to RFID\nreaders, but money itself doesn’t require technology, much less any specific\ntechnology, to work. All it requires is that social agreement.\n\nWhile infrastructural systems do involve social agreements around\ntechnologies, they share another important element. It’s not just that\neveryone does things the same way. It’s that there’s a reason to do things the\nsame way, together.\n\nMost of the technological systems that we consider to be infrastructure are\nnetworks, connections between different places in the world. This is most\nobvious for transportation, ways to get from point A to point B: roads, rail\nnetworks, air travel, shipping, or transmodal combinations. Faucets and drains\nare points on our water and sewage systems that are connected by water mains,\nsewage pipes, reservoirs, and treatment plants; the oven in my kitchen is a\nnode on the municipal network of natural gas pipes, as is the furnace of the\nbuilding where I live. We’re also embedded in electrical networks that light\nup and power our homes and workplaces, and telecommunications networks that\nconnect us to others, once by dots and dashes, then by analog signals, and now\nincreasingly by digital data, in all its varied permutations.\n\nWhat makes networks special is not just that they’re collective but that they\ncan also be synergistic: the more people who use them, the more valuable they\nbecome for everyone. The larger the population of a settlement, for example,\nthe more incentive there is to make the substantive upfront investment in\nbuilding out a shared water supply. Every community, home, or business that is\nconnected to a road or a telephone network makes the whole network more\nvaluable for everyone else on it. The more people in your neighborhood who use\nelectricity, the cheaper it becomes to deliver it. What’s more,\ninfrastructural systems often have benefits that go beyond the individual.\nAccess to clean water reduces the risk of contagious waterborne disease for\neveryone, and electric lighting reduces the risk of fires. This\nintersection—technology, networks, and the value of universal access—is the\nkey to why infrastructure is often considered a public good, in both the\neconomic and everyday sense. And it’s not static: the development and adoption\nof new networked technologies leads to new ideas of what’s considered to be a\nuniversal need. We’ve been seeing this evolution happen in real time over the\npast decade or so as home broadband Internet access went from being useful but\nnonessential to being a primary means of interacting with systems and public\nservices, including education.\n\nAs a child, I was most impressed by the technological elegance of\ninfrastructure, and I still think that these systems are fascinating. As an\nadult, though, I’ve begun to see the networked, technological systems that are\nthe focus of this book in a much different way. We might interact with them as\nindividuals but they’re inherently collective, social, and spatial. Because\nthey bring resources to where they’re used, they create enduring relationships\nnot just between the people who share the network but also between those\npeople and _place_ , where they are in the world and the landscape the network\ntraverses. These systems make manifest our ability to cooperate to meet\nuniversal needs and care for each other. We need those skills and behaviors,\nmaybe more than ever before in human history. But that cooperation and care is\nby no means the whole story, because these systems also fail many people and\neven cause harm. Our infrastructural systems tell a story of who we are as a\nsociety or even a civilization, one that’s about the relationships we have\nwith one another and the planet that’s our home. Hearing that story is part of\nlearning how we can do better, and why it matters to all of us.\n\n## Situated Perspectives\n\nWhen I was nine, my family lived in Bhopal, India, in my father’s family home,\nfor six months.\n\nIf culture is everything that you do without thinking much about why you’re\ndoing it, then our infrastructural systems, and the ways of life they make\npossible, are unquestionably an important part of culture. Even as a child,\nthe differences between Canada and India—language, social norms, the deep\npoverty and the unignorable inequality, having strict Catholic nuns as\nteachers—required serious adjustment. There was also a culture shock\nassociated with the infrastructural systems. The municipal water provision\nwhere we lived was on a rotating schedule, so we only had running water for an\nhour or so in the morning and again in the evening, and we collected it in\nbuckets to use for bathing and flushing toilets all the rest of the time. My\nmother boiled and filtered the water to make it potable to digestive and\nimmune systems that were accustomed to clean, cold, carefully treated water\nfrom Lake Ontario. We quickly learned to expect brownouts and power cuts as\nthe growing city’s electrical grid struggled to cope with the fans and\nevaporative coolers that were brought to bear against the summer heat.\n\nMy family moved back to Toronto in late autumn that year, and then I spent\nanother six or so months in India when I was sixteen. That time in India made\nme unavoidably aware of the systems that were all working, quietly and\ncontinuously and reliably, to meet my basic needs as I was growing up. I doubt\nI would have noticed or thought anywhere near as much about infrastructure had\nI not lived in these two different places. By moving to Canada, my parents had\ngiven me a new citizenship in a country with a different set of educational\nand economic opportunities, alongside of which was the infrastructural\nbirthright that underpinned my ability to access them.\n\nCollective infrastructures are a good candidate for the most complex systems\ncreated by humans. They are planetary in scale, build on their own histories,\nare entangled with each other, and have impacts that extend far into the\nfuture. Their design, construction, and operation require a wide range of\ntechnical disciplines—civil engineering, obviously, but also electrical\nengineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering, and the\nscience of systems and of networks. All of these fields incorporate not just\ntechnologies but practices, ways of thinking, doing, and building. The\ndecision-making and funding around these systems, particularly public systems,\nis the province of policy, finance, and economics. Finally, as systems that\nrequire land and resources, it’s impossible to extricate infrastructure from a\nlarger history of conquest, colonialism, and capitalism and, particularly but\nby no means exclusively in the U.S., from racism and white supremacy. The\ntheorist Timothy Morton coined the word “hyperobject” for just these sorts of\nsystems that span multiple time scales, length scales, and social settings.\n\nMy friend Helen Macdonald’s writing about the natural environment has\ninfluenced how I think about infrastructural systems. A forest is home to\ntrees, plants, fungi, and lichen, as well as to birds, insects, reptiles,\namphibians, small and large mammals, and more, each of which is in an ongoing\necological relationship with the others. Every forest is a hyperobject, an\nenormously complex environment that’s shaped not just by its location,\nlandscape, and climate but also by the history of humans in that place. If you\ngo on a walk in the woods, what you see depends on the season and the\nparticular path you take through it. More than anything, though, what you see\nin the woods depends on the eyes that you are seeing it through. A birder, a\nhunter, an entomologist, a soil ecologist, a real estate developer, and an\nartist will all see different things. Helen introduced me to Richard Mabey’s\nidea that the natural world can only be understood and appreciated as a result\nof careful, knowledgeable attention. Without the ability to describe the\ndifferences with detail and specificity, a meadow of native grasses and the\npesticide-soaked monoculture of a golf course that replaces it are effectively\nindistinguishable. Helen borrowed Mabey’s phrase for this in an interview,\ncalling it a “green blur.” We’ll be taking a closer look at the “gray blur” of\nour infrastructural landscape as we go on a walk through it, in the hope of\nresolving some of the details. But, as with a forest, it’s just one trail with\na particular guide, and what we see depends a lot on who’s doing the looking.\n\nInfrastructure is inextricable from culture, woven as it is into our daily\nlife as well as our history, politics, civic life, and our visions of the\nfuture for our families and our communities. My path through infrastructural\nsystems, and therefore what I see when I look at them, is deeply rooted in my\nown experiences. I’ve lived most of my life in cities in four countries:\nCanada, the United States, India, and the United Kingdom. I joke that as a\ndual U.S.-Canadian citizen of Indian descent, I’m a colonial three times over.\nWhile that gives me a very specific perspective on the British Empire and its\ninfrastructural projects, growing up in anglophone North America means that\nEngland has, in turn, shaped my perspective on the world. I also spent most of\nmy adolescence and young adulthood training as an engineer and a scientist\nbefore becoming an engineering professor. It’s how I came to the world of\ninfrastructure, and it’s a big part of how I think about and describe it: as\nnetworks and systems, energy and material flows, standards and technologies,\nefficiency and elegance, with a similar vocabulary and perspective as the\nengineers who built these systems out.\n\nBut it’s at least as important to my perspective on infrastructural systems\nthat I’m the daughter of immigrants who came from a postcolonial country in\nthe Global South and settled in a rich, industrialized country. I recognize\nthat I’m a historical anomaly, and something of an anomaly even today. All\nover the planet, the responsibility for hygiene and food preparation most\noften falls to women. The highly gendered nature of this labor means that\nfetching clean drinking water or obtaining fuel to burn for cooking are daily\nactivities for billions of women globally, especially ones who look like me,\nbrown-skinned and middle-aged. They trade their time and the energy of their\nown bodies to ensure that the most basic needs of their families are met. My\nlife, as I know it, has mostly been made possible because I had the sheer\nblind luck of being born into a time and place where my survival needs were\nmet and continue to be met every day by shared infrastructure. What might our\nworld be like if access to these systems were universal?\n\n## Cracks in the Technological Foundations\n\nLike most living creatures, humans habituate to whatever’s unchanging in our\nenvironments. The more robust and reliable our infrastructural systems are,\nthe less we think about them, and the more time and attention we put into\nother things. When I get up in the morning, I don’t think about the water\ncoming out of the bathroom tap in the same way that I don’t think about the\nsun rising. But unlike the sun rising, our infrastructural systems are built\nby humans, for humans, and all technological systems need care and\nmaintenance. Infrastructural systems are famously boring because the best\npossible outcome is nothing happening, or at least nothing unexpected or\nuntoward. But nothing happens, and nothing continues to happen, as a result of\nsufficient attention, specialized care, and unceasing oversight. “Nothing\nhappening” is usually the result of careful inspection schedules, preventive\nmaintenance, and planned replacement, all of which require resources to be\ndevoted to what will be, at best, a null outcome. Across the U.S., decades of\nunderinvestment in infrastructure mean that systems like transportation and\nthe electrical grid are failing more frequently, whether small failures like\ndelayed subway trains, potholes, or a local power outage, or catastrophic ones\nlike a bridge collapse or a multiday blackout. Even systems that might have\nbeen adequate when they were built are failing to keep pace with changes in\nthe larger world, whether predictable ones like population growth or new\nchallenges like contaminants in water supplies.\n\nFailure is relative to expectations, of course. Access to a suite of reliable,\nmodern infrastructural systems is the global exception, not the rule.\nCommunities all over the world, including in the U.S., have unreliable or\nlimited access to electricity, to clean water or improved sanitation, to\nenergy for cooking, or to reliable telecommunications. Many decades after they\nwere first built, we have a much more widespread understanding of the\ninjustices that can be encoded in these systems—where they are built and for\nwhom, where they draw resources from, and who’s most impacted by negative\nconsequences, from air pollution to flooding to noise and congestion.\n\nBut the biggest threats to infrastructural systems don’t come from neglect or\nunderfunding. They are inherent. Infrastructural networks are built to move\nresources from place to place—atoms and bits, electrons and photons, people\nand things—and to do so reliably and continuously. The substrate that they are\nembedded in and traverse is the landscape. Reliability and continuity\npresuppose a certain stability, but the climate is no longer stable. Rather\nthan being something that we’re headed toward, anthropogenic climate change is\nnow something that we are living through. Globally, every year since 2015 has\nbeen among the warmest years ever recorded, and we are beginning to see the\neffects everywhere. The western U.S. has now seen years of record-setting\ndrought, followed by years of intense rainfall and flooding, followed by years\nof deadly wildfires. In the eastern U.S., there was Hurricane Sandy and dark,\nflooded lower Manhattan. In Puerto Rico, communities were left without power\nfor nearly a year after Hurricane Maria. In 2020, there were so many named\nhurricanes that we went through the entire Roman alphabet and started in with\nGreek letters, with Hurricane Zeta making landfall in the U.S. in late\nOctober. Every natural disaster is the result of an interaction between a\nnatural event and human systems, and an important measure of the severity is\nthe degree to which infrastructural systems are affected or how quickly they\ncan be repaired. Functional infrastructure is resilient infrastructure.\n\nAll technological systems require energy to function, and the vast majority of\nthat energy still comes from fossil fuels. Infrastructure is also a major\n_contributor_ to climate change. In the U.S., electricity generation accounts\nfor more than a quarter of all greenhouse gases. Transportation accounts for\nanother 30 percent or so, and another few percent come directly from household\nuse, like the natural gas that’s burned to warm my home and cook my dinner. In\ntotal, energy use that’s mediated by infrastructural systems accounts for\nclose to two thirds of emissions.\n\nWhat all of this means is that there is no more taking our infrastructural\nsystems for granted, anywhere. In the Bugs Bunny cartoons, Wile E. Coyote\nraces off the edge of a cliff, looks around for a moment, realizes there is\nnothing below him but thin air, and _then_ he falls. If infrastructure becomes\nmost visible when it fails, we are at the exact moment when, like Coyote, we\nare looking around and seeing where our societal decisions have led us. But\nunlike Coyote’s fall, there’s nothing inevitable about what happens next.\n\n## Our Fractured Past and Our Shared Future\n\nThe hyperobjects that are our collective infrastructural systems shape not\njust what we actually do, day after day, as individuals and as communities,\nbut even the possibilities for what we can consider doing. The cost of not\nbeing able to rely on previously reliable systems is unthinkably high: to have\nhad well-functioning infrastructural systems and then to lose them is\nrecognizably dystopian, the stuff of postapocalyptic science fiction. Which\nmeans that we can’t live without them and we can’t keep them as they are.\nWhat’s more, we can only change them together.\n\nBut here’s the thing: we have everything we need to create a different world,\nfor everyone. We have myriad ways to harness renewable energy. It’s possible\nto transform and rebuild our collective infrastructural systems to be\nfunctional and also resilient and sustainable. This gives us an unprecedented\nopportunity to rethink them for the coming century, instead of being defined\nby the previous one. That includes recognizing the fundamental injustices\nbuilt into these systems, from the neighborhood to the planetary level, and\nredressing them. Fifty years ago, transforming these systems would have been\nan intractable engineering problem. No longer—today, the challenges we face\nare largely social and mostly boil down to this: How do we work together to\ntransform these collective systems? Because the one thing we do know is that\nthese shared systems that shape our lives, both affording and constraining the\nways in which we do things, can’t be changed appreciably by individual action\nalone.\n\nMy own relationship with infrastructure started when I was a young girl\nfascinated by huge engineering facilities, and I came to see and appreciate\nthem as among the most compelling of human creations. Over the past decade or\nso, I went to stand at the edge of reservoirs, in a power station inside a\nmountain, on the crest of one massive dam in the desert, and on the ruins of\nanother. I toured sewage treatment plants, walked a road that humans have\nfollowed for five millennia, stood between rows of tilted solar panels and\namong majestically spinning wind turbines, and walked the channel of a river\nthrough a city and down to the sea. These systems are how we care for our\nbodies wherever they are on the planet, and so I took my body to the systems\nto try to understand them. The more I learned, the more I saw how deeply our\ninfrastructural systems were shaped by our cultures—often the best aspects of\nourselves, as we committed to take care of each other, but also the very\nworst, literally building institutionalized racism into our highways, dams,\nand power systems, creating a world of haves and have-nots. I gradually began\nto apprehend all the ways our infrastructural systems don’t serve us well—and\nto think more deeply about who counts as “us.” I started to recognize the\ndegree to which they are under threat, and I learned that we have the\ntechnologies to respond to these threats, but also that doing so lends itself\nto a very different way of organizing our communities and our society.\n\nIt might be a truism that you can’t solve a problem with the same mindset that\ncreated it, but you do still have to first recognize and understand the\nproblem and, however you approach it, the solutions need to be on the same\n_scale_ as the problem. Our infrastructural systems make our individual daily\nlives possible, but they are vast and collective, and so they can only be\nseen, understood, and transformed collectively. This book is intended to be a\nstepping stone to that transformation, but it’s not a how-to manual. It’s a\n_why-to_ , and a _where-to_ , manual.\n\n\n# Two\n\n# Infrastructure as Agency\n\nOn a typical evening, I might drive or take the subway home to my apartment. I\nlet myself in, turn on the lights, put down my bags, and take off my coat and\nshoes. I turn the stereo on and set it to play music streamed from my phone,\nand I head into the kitchen to make dinner. If I’m cooking something like\nnoodles for dinner, I can get a pot from the cupboard, fill it from the tap,\nand set it on the stovetop to boil, and then take some vegetables out of the\nfridge to prepare. After years of practice, I can usually be sitting down to a\nhot meal in less than half an hour. Once I’ve eaten, I take a few minutes more\nto clean up, putting the waste in the trash and washing the dishes in a sink\nof hot water.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my parents had a small Hindu altar set up in our home,\nwith mounted posters of several multiarmed gods and goddesses in the\nheightened-realism illustration style that’s common for these icons. As a\nchild, I was fascinated by the warrior-goddess Durga, who was depicted with\nweapons in many of her hands and riding a tiger that’s trampling a demon under\nits paws. Despite what those terrifying attributes would suggest, Durga isn’t\nassociated with only war and destruction—she’s also a goddess of protection.\nThat’s why she’s almost always portrayed with a gentle, peaceful smile on her\nface. Durga Mata (“Mother Durga”) fights not out of hatred or fear or even\nself-defense, but on behalf of those who depend on her, for their safety and\nliberation.\n\nI described myself making dinner because it might be the quietest and most\ndomestic part of my day. Let’s get real: it’s boring. But that very\nordinariness is utterly extraordinary. Hiding in plain sight in this scene are\nmany of the different ways in which our infrastructural systems augment what’s\npossible for me to do with my body alone. Common infrastructural\nsystems—water, sewage, electricity, natural gas, transportation, and\ncommunications—are amazing in that they make it possible for me to live the\nkind of life that I want to live, a life of comfort, agency, diversion, and\nconnection to others. Some of them deliver useful matter, such as clean water,\nfuel to burn for useful heat, or physical goods. Another provides versatile\nenergy, in the form of electricity. Infrastructural systems make it possible\nfor my own body to move around the world so I can be with others, in other\nplaces. I can command fire with the flick of a wrist, even if I’m just going\nto use it to soft-boil an egg. On the coldest winter mornings, I wake up in a\nhome that’s warm and comfortable. Global telecommunications mean that I can\nstay in instantaneous connection with colleagues, friends, and family all over\nthe planet. Riding my bike on paved roads takes me farther and faster than I\ncould go on foot, or I could get into my car, or catch a train. And I can fly,\ncrossing an ocean in hours. But even alone in my kitchen, I’m an\ninfrastructure-goddess Durga, far seeing, with a host of tools and abilities\nat my fingertips. Above all, I’m _powerful_.\n\nSince they’re always there for my use, at any moment of the day, these\ninfrastructural systems are all but part of me—they extend my capabilities\nbeyond my biological limitations in a way that I almost never have to think\nabout. I can’t see in the dark, but abundant artificial light means that I\nmight as well be able to. The interfaces to these systems are even scaled and\nshaped to my body: the intensity and color temperature of the lightbulbs,\ncomfortably heated water for washing and bathing, and the ambient temperature\nof my apartment; the width of a sidewalk, the turnstiles at the subway\nstation; the placement of power outlets; the size and shape of all the\nswitches and knobs in my home; everything from my smartphone to the toilet.\n\nThe most direct example of this is my car, which essentially makes me into a\n_cyborg_ , an actual, exoskeleton-wearing, Sigourney-Weaver-in-a-power-loader-\nfighting-off-the-xenomorph-queen cyborg. When I’m in the driver’s seat, I’m\nwearing a metal shell that protects me, gives me equipment that doesn’t\nexactly come standard on a human body (like wheels, sure, but also a stereo!)\nand, most importantly, gives me direct control over an enormous store of\nenergy that is exogenous to my body itself. The car I’ve been driving has an\ninternal combustion engine that produces about 150 horsepower, which makes it\nmodestly powered by American vehicle standards but is still a considerable\namount of energy for one person to be in charge of. On a full tank of gas, I\ncan transport myself, four passengers, and a trunkful of gear about 350 miles\n(more than 550 kilometers) in about five hours. The utility of cars—their\nappeal—is exactly that they make us more powerful and capable as\n_individuals_. It’s why the selling point of private vehicles, as featured in\ncountless advertisements, has always been freedom: that you can choose when to\nleave and where to go, and your car will take you there. Cars serve as a\npersonal interface to an infrastructural system of personal mobility: not just\nthe network of roads, but also the fueling stations that are located alongside\n(there’s somewhere upward of a hundred thousand gas stations in the U.S.\nalone), and the entire supply chain for extracting, refining, and delivering\ngasoline to all of them.\n\nBut here’s the thing: when I flip a light switch, I’m just as much a human-\nmachine hybrid as when I’m driving. The difference is that I’m standing in my\nkitchen, and the “machine” is the entire electrical grid—giant turbines\nspinning up to power huge generators, thousands of miles of power lines, the\nlocal substations, neighborhood transformers, plus the enormous amount of\nhuman expertise necessary to design, build, operate, and maintain these\nsystems. Alone at home I am a continent-spanning colossus, reaching out for my\ntiny share of these communal systems, whether it’s a few drops of water from\nmy local reservoir via the municipal treatment plant or a few electrons\ngetting a push from a dam in northern Quebec, thousands of miles away. If\ndriving my car makes me a cyborg because it augments my individual body with a\nmore powerful machine, then these systems make me part of, in the words of\ninfrastructure researcher Paul Graham Raven, a “cyborg collective.”\n\n## A Brighter World\n\nFor many years, I’ve lived in an apartment in a four-story mixed-use building\nin central Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was originally built in the late\nnineteenth century, constructed in an ornate Richardsonian Romanesque style,\ncomplete with arched windows, a tower, and elaborate carvings over the\nentrances. I occasionally think about what the lives of the people who were in\nthe space before me were like, but I also think about the converse: What if\nthe original occupants of my building came a century and a half forward in\ntime to my home in the present day—what would surprise them the most?\n\nMy personal library (an admittedly somewhat genteel way to say that my home is\nfull of books) would certainly be impressive as well as unexpectedly colorful,\nthanks to modern printing technology. What I think of as a relatively modest\npersonal wardrobe would come across as anything but to someone visiting from\nthe early days of industrialization. It’s almost all black and in plain cuts,\nwhich even nineteenth-century Bostonians might find oddly puritanical and old-\nfashioned if it weren’t for the wide diversity of textures, with wool and\ncotton hanging alongside modern synthetics and technical materials. Although\nmy visitors would be familiar with mechanized textile production—it was a\nmajor driver of the Industrial Revolution—the contents of my closets still\nrepresent an absolutely astounding amount of effort in spinning, weaving or\nknitting, and sewing. More generally, the sheer amount of _stuff_ in my\napartment might be overwhelming, especially in light of its precision and\ndetail since almost everything I own is mass-produced by machinery rather than\nbeing made by hand. The refrigerator and freezer would be impressive but not\nastonishing, I suspect. The last decades of the nineteenth century were the\npeak of the natural ice trade, which employed tens of thousands of people in\nNew England to cut, store, and ship winter ice, and artificial refrigeration\ntechnologies had already started to come into use for industrial applications.\nSo my nomination for the most startlingly futuristic aspect of my home,\nespecially on a winter’s evening, would be just how _bright_ it is, and how\nall of the light is cool and white, flameless and odorless, with no apparent\nfuel source and lit or extinguished with a flick of a switch.\n\nIt’s easy to take artificial light for granted and never think about what an\nenabling technology it is to be able to see equally well whether it’s day or\nnight or, for that matter, in any closed interior space. It’s not a survival\nneed, but seeing in the dark is effectively a superpower. While light has been\nscarce and expensive for almost all of human history, the past two centuries\nor so saw the cost of light (the price per lumen-hour) drop by a factor of ten\nthousand. As Bostonians from the late nineteenth century, my hypothetical\nvisitors would likely have been familiar with two important contributors to\nthis dramatic change: the rise of coal-derived “town gas,” distributed to\nbuildings via municipal pipes; and the decline of the whaling industry and\nwith it the use of whale oil for lighting, as kerosene from the rapidly\nexpanding fossil fuel industry became the dominant liquid fuel for lamps. But\neven if they had heard about Thomas Edison in Menlo Park and his ongoing\nexperiments with electricity and incandescent lightbulbs, they would probably\nstill be unprepared for the brightly lit world that would result. Economic\nhistorians estimated that the total consumption of light in the UK today is\nabout a _hundred thousand_ times greater than it was in 1700. Winter days\naren’t quite as short here, but assuming a similar trajectory, modern New\nEngland uses about a hundred times more light now than in 1888. I can barely\nimagine what it would be like to live in that world, where it was mostly just\ndark, for months on end. In fact, access to more resources leads so\nuniversally and predictably to an increase in artificial light that\nresearchers have even used it as a proxy for economic growth, observing how\nnighttime satellite images of a particular region glow more brightly over\ntime. Developed regions are brighter than comparable regions in less developed\nareas. South Korea, for example, blazes from coast to coast, with a clear\nshoreline. But after years of sanctions and scarcity, North Korea is nearly\ninvisible in nighttime images except for a faint cobweb of light reaching out\nfrom the capital of Pyongyang. Besides energy itself, barrierless access to\nartificial light might be the closest thing we have to pure agency, literally\nproviding more hours in the day.\n\n## Warm Homes and Hot Dinners\n\nJust as artificial light makes it possible for me to do what I’d like well\ninto the night, living in a home with adequate heating means that I don’t\nspend the winter huddled under blankets for warmth, or my days managing a\nstove. Like most urban buildings in the northeast corner of the United States,\nmine is heated by the combustion of natural gas, which is mostly methane with\na few percent of ethane. The local distribution system started as the pipes\nthat were originally built to deliver the town gas that my time travelers\nwould recognize from streetlights (it’s the gas in “gaslight”). The longer-\nrange transmission network started as pipelines that were crash-built by a\nconsortium of oil companies during World War II to bring Texas crude and oil\nproducts to New York and Pennsylvania for refining and transshipment to the\nEuropean front. The construction of fifteen hundred miles of pipeline—the\nlongest and biggest of its kind at the time—was mandated by the U.S.\ngovernment and funded as a war measure because the sea routes were no longer\nsafe or viable: barges loaded with oil and headed up the Atlantic coast were a\nsoft target for German U-boats. Once the war ended, the pipelines were sold\noff as surplus, then retrofitted to carry natural gas and connected to the\nmunicipal networks. At the oilfields in the Southwest, large quantities of\nnatural gas were an undesirable by-product of extraction, often just flared\noff at the wellhead. By getting it to buildings in the energy-hungry\nNortheast, oil companies could arbitrage and profit from the difference in\nvalue to the two regions. Once the pipelines made it possible to deliver\nnatural gas efficiently (and therefore inexpensively), it quickly became the\ndominant fuel for heating in the region.\n\nBesides powering the furnace and the hot-water heater in my building, some of\nthat natural gas is delivered to the stove in my kitchen. Whenever I want to\ncook, I just turn a knob and the blue flame instantly whooshes out. Hot meals\naren’t a luxury; while individuals can survive without hot food, there are no\nknown human cultures that don’t cook their food. Raising the temperature of\nraw plant or animal matter causes chemical changes that makes the nutrients\nmuch more bioavailable—in other words, more nutritional value out of less\nfoodstuffs. The species-wide uptake of this strategy speaks to its\neffectiveness, but it’s also why obtaining fuel is a daily preoccupation for\nmuch of the world’s population. For humans, eating means cooking. That’s the\nglobal context for what it means for me to have all of the fuel I could ever\nneed for food preparation at my fingertips. The local context, including the\npresence of a municipal distribution network and transmission pipelines and\nthe federal and state policies that caused them to be built, means that the\nfuel that I use for food preparation costs me shockingly little in labor\nterms. My gas bill for a month of food preparation corresponds to only about\nan hour or so of work at the state minimum wage. Nearly as much as artificial\nlight and potable water. Only needing to work a few minutes a day in order to\nhave sufficient energy to cook all my food makes my life different from that\nof most women worldwide.\n\n## Mechanical Work and Physical Labor\n\nAfter I’ve eaten, it’s time to clean up and do other housekeeping. I don’t\nhave a dishwasher, so I wash my dishes by hand with the on-tap hot water that\nmakes it fast and easy. In a rare and pleasing example of not needing to put\nenergy into the system to get a desired outcome, if I set my dishes in the\nrack and leave them alone, they’ll spontaneously dry themselves. I do use an\nelectric washing machine for my laundry, a standard American-style top-loader,\nwith a rotating perforated drum and a central agitator. There’s no designated\nlaundry day in my home—it gets started when I have a pile of dirty clothes and\na spare ten minutes, and then I go do other things until the clothes are ready\nto go into the dryer, be hung up to air dry, or be folded and put away. I\ndon’t need to use my own physical labor to scrub sodden, heavy clothing to\nloosen dirt, nor to rinse it, nor to wring out the excess water. My washing\nmachine runs on electricity, of course, but here that power is doing a very\ndifferent job than it does in lightbulbs or in heating elements. It’s being\ntransformed into motion by means of a motor, producing the forces needed to\nspin the washer drum and to agitate my clothes inside it. Like a waterwheel,\nan electric motor produces rotary motion by default, but clever mechanical\nengineering can then get many other movements. Motors make it possible for\nelectricity to replace all sorts of human physical effort—when we talk about\nlabor-saving devices, this is usually what we’re thinking about.\n\nIn the domestic sphere, much of this work would be performed with our own\nbodies, whether individually or in concert with others. This is ordinary human\nlabor—moving ourselves around, moving things around—but our bodies are limited\nin important ways. The first is time. We can do things, sure, but there are\nonly so many hours in a day and so many days in our lives, and the time spent\nin this labor is time _not_ spent doing other things. Fetching water to drink\nor acquiring fuel for cooking are tasks that meet survival needs, and as such\nthey take precedence over other activities. The second limiting factor in\nusing the energy of our bodies to do work is that it results in fatigue. We\nget tired! Depending on the work we’re doing, we might not have the physical\nstamina to do much else. Finally, powered machinery makes it possible to do\nthings in ways that humans are otherwise incapable of, like vacuuming carpets\ninstead of beating them to remove dust.\n\nEverything I’ve described—the kinds of domestic labor I do, how I do it, and\nhow often—is obviously very middle-class, early twenty-first century, and\nU.S.-centric. The nature of household work has varied enormously by time and\nplace, and it’s heavily shaped and constrained by social norms. In her\ngroundbreaking 1985 work, _More Work for Mother_ , the historian Ruth Schwartz\nCowan argued that, despite the Industrial Revolution, the build-out of\nnetworks for fuel, clean water, and electricity, and the spread of household\nappliances, middle-class women were spending as much time on domestic labor in\n1950 as a century earlier. Their work was industrialized, and they began to be\nheld to higher standards like cleaning and doing laundry more often, or making\nmore complicated meals. But even if they didn’t replace work, what appliances\ndid generally replace was _drudgery_ —no more lugging water or coal, and a\nwashing machine makes doing laundry a very different proposition from\nhandwashing clothes. But even more saliently: in 1950, a housewife could\nsingle-handedly produce a middle-class standard of living for her family while\nher 1850 counterpart would likely have had one or many servants—“hired\nhelp”—to do the same. Those middle-class standards of hygiene and comfort (and\nthe markedly reduced rates of illness that went with them) became widely\navailable to many more people, not just to a small fraction of a population\nsupported by the labor of the remainder.\n\nIn all of human history, only the smallest handful of people have been able to\nlive the kind of life that I get to take for granted, and they’ve only been\nable to do so because others were doing all of the caregiving work that they\nneeded. When we say that someone is “supported” by a partner, we usually mean\nthat they’re supported financially. We tend to lose sight of how domestic\nlabor—doing work to make sure the people around you are warm, fed, clean, and\nhealthy—supports survival. It’s work that needs to happen every day, without\nfail. Globally, this is gendered labor, largely performed by women. But in my\nhousehold, this work is eased by access to shared infrastructural networks\nthat deliver the fuel whose combustion warms my home and cooks my food, clean\nwater, and electricity that provides light and the mechanical energy to\nreplace the physical labor of my body.\n\n## To Be with Others, in Many Ways\n\nHumans move through the world. Our bipedal stance means that our dominant gait\nis walking—we swing our long legs like alternating pendulums, letting gravity\ndo most of the work and catching ourselves at the end of each step. If we want\nto go faster, we can run, but running requires much more power since at every\nstep we propel ourselves off the ground and forward. To go farther, faster, or\nmove more weight, humans have used a range of strategies. One is to modify the\nsurface and the path—even the narrowest trail means less resistance to forward\nmovement. Devices like the wheel make motion more efficient so we can make the\nmost of our limited bodily energy. Humans have also harnessed energy found in\nour environment, like flowing water or blowing wind, or even just an incline.\nIf you’ve ever ridden a bicycle down a hill on a smooth road, you’ve used all\nthree of these strategies put together. But the real step up in facilitating\nmobility is to bring more energy to bear. For many thousands of years, it was\nthe power of other living creatures, from boisterous sled dogs to enormous\ndraft horses. Now, of course, most of the energy for movement comes from\ntechnological sources, in the form of motorized transportation powered by\nelectricity or by combustion. Personal cars might make us individual cyborgs,\nbut motorized mass transit—buses, trains, ships, and above all aviation—puts\nenergy to work to provide new and unprecedented access to personal mobility.\nHumans move around for the same reasons we’ve always moved around: to get to\nwhere we need to be to do work, to obtain something we need or desire, to\nexplore our environment, and to move for the sheer joy of moving. But above\nall, we move around to be with other people, because sociality is another\nhuman universal. As transportation systems have grown in size, speed, and\nextent, so too have our communities, in both senses: the built environments in\nwhich we live, but also the local and extended groups of people with whom we\nhave relationships. Personal mobility is enhanced by motorized transportation\ninfrastructure with its continuing access to energy outside of our bodies. Our\nability to be with the people around us has grown to encompass greater and\ngreater distances, whether it’s a daily twenty-mile commute or getting on a\ncommercial airliner to fly to the other side of the planet in less than a day.\nThese transportation systems are what allow me to be with my colleagues and my\nstudents on most days, and with my friends and family around the world.\n\nWhile being physically copresent with others might be the oldest form of human\nconnection, the newest infrastructural systems make it possible for us to stay\nconnected with each other in ways that otherwise simply wouldn’t exist. I live\nalone, and so my home is mostly about my not being in it. It’s right at a\nsubway station in a dense, walkable neighborhood; I drive a car and ride my\nbike; and I have quick, easy access to a train station, an airport, and even\nferries. But for fifteen months or so—by far the longest stretch of my life—I\nmostly didn’t access any of these transportation systems. I didn’t take the T\ndowntown, or the train to New York or Washington, nor did I get on a plane to\nvisit my family in Los Angeles or outside Toronto. While the COVID-19 pandemic\nwas a global public health crisis that touched the lives of everyone on the\nplanet, the nature of its impact was widely variable. I was in the class of\npeople who were largely able to shelter in place, because I have stable\nhousing and a stable income and was able to depend on infrastructure, food,\nand other systems that were kept running by essential workers. But one thing\nthat almost everyone, including me, had in common was that we limited the\namount of time we spent with people outside our households in order to keep\nour communities safe. That meant that we collectively used transportation much\nless. It also meant that many of us used telecommunications—an entirely\ndifferent way of staying connected—much more.\n\nIn February 2020, a few weeks before the college where I teach closed its\ndoors and sent our students away, I was on the phone with my local cable\ncompany arranging to upgrade the minimal, janky Internet service that had\nalways been all I needed because I spent so little time at home, and it had\nalready become clear that I would soon be leaning hard on copresence via\ntelecommunications. In a very real sense, my Internet connection replaced my\ntransportation infrastructure for the duration. I taught my classes over Zoom;\nI stayed in touch with my friends and family through FaceTime and social\nmedia; I distracted myself with streaming video and tried to keep in shape\nwith online workouts; and I did most of my personal administrative tasks, like\nbanking and civic engagement, through websites. And honestly, it saved me. Not\njust in the practical sense of being able to fulfill my responsibilities as a\ncollege professor and pay my taxes, but because having a high-bandwidth\nInternet connection is what ameliorated the wrenching loneliness of getting\nthrough fifteen months of almost no physical contact with other human beings.\n\nGlobal telecommunications enabled me to be, as anthropologist Caitrin Lynch\nput it, “physically distant but socially close” to her and my other\ncolleagues, our students, and to the people in my life that I love. I’m old\nenough to not take the Internet, never mind videoconferencing, for granted.\nFor most of my youth, the main way that my parents in Canada kept in touch\nwith their families back home in India was by sending written letters through\nthe post. There was the occasional card for birthdays or Diwali, but mostly\nthe letters were envelope-less aerograms—single sheets of flimsy blue paper,\nfolded into thirds, glued shut, and addressed and stamped on the outside. For\nimportant news, there were telegrams—I’m just old enough to remember receiving\ntelegrams from my extended family on my birthday. (The state telecom service\nin India was a long holdout, continuing to send general-purpose telegrams\nuntil 2013.) Long-distance voice calls—unreliable, expensive, and laggy—were\nreserved for the most urgent communications. I remember the long, sleepless\nnight before my father succeeded in making contact with his brother and\nsisters in Bhopal as news of the Union Carbide industrial disaster began to\ntrickle out.\n\nAs I was writing this, the periodic buzzing of my phone let me know that my\nsiblings are posting to our family WhatsApp group, sharing photos of my niece\nand nephews and other snippets of their daily lives, and that my friends were\nsending messages ranging from cute cat photos to travel scheduling to\npolitical commentary. When my aging smartphone died unexpectedly on New Year’s\nEve a few years ago, getting a replacement suddenly became the top item on my\nto-do list for that day. My Internet connection was fine and so was the mobile\nphone network, but not having a working phone was a reminder that much of the\nvalue of infrastructural networks depends on being able to interface with the\nsystems. Live electrical outlets in your home aren’t useful without appliances\nthat run on electricity, or ones with the wrong kind of plug. In that sense,\nmy smartphone is like an astoundingly complicated multifunctional Internet-\npowered toaster. It’s an appliance that makes it possible for me to interface\nwith a network to do something useful, except that instead of making my bread\ncrispy, it lets me use modern telecommunications to engage with online social\ninfrastructure like the World Wide Web, messaging, and photosharing.\n\nTelecommunications networks run, of course, on electricity. It powers all of\nthe storage and computation behind every website and streaming service—large\ndata centers have been sited near hydroelectricity plants to take advantage of\ninexpensive power—and also all of the connectivity and communication, the\ntransmission towers, switching stations, and more. Wireless communication, for\nexample, is possible because electrical signals lend themselves to being\nconverted to electromagnetic waves that can be sent through the air and then\ntransformed back into electrical signals in wires, and that data can convey\ninformation in a wide variety of ways. If mechanized transportation is a way\nto use unprecedented amounts of energy to connect with each other in a way as\nold as humanity—by physically being with each other—then telecommunications is\nabout using energy to connect with each other in entirely unprecedented ways.\n\nTelecommunications systems illustrate another point, which is that we can be\ndirectly responsible for energy usage even if we never directly observe or\ncontrol it. When I watch a movie on a streaming service, the electricity that\npowers the display and my Internet router—the electricity usage that shows up\non my utility bill—is only part of the energy consumption story. It also\nrequires data centers full of servers running twenty-four hours a day to store\nand serve up movies on demand, and the transmission of that data to my home.\nIt’s easy to never think about the energy usage of data centers that might be\nhundreds or thousands of miles away. But there’s another way in which we are\nthe end users of energy, one that’s at least as important and ubiquitous yet\neven less obvious.\n\n## The Embodied Energy of Objects\n\nFor the past few years, I’ve been learning how to blow glass. About once a\nweek, I head over to a glassblowing studio in an industrial building that sits\non the railway tracks in north Cambridge. When you walk in, the first thing\nyou notice are the furnaces. There’s a large one with a door that slides open\nto reveal a reservoir of yellow-hot molten glass, and there are several “glory\nholes,” the smaller furnaces used to reheat the glass on the end of a pipe or\nrod while it’s being shaped (the name caught on because of the way the\ncircular openings would glow brightly in dim, smoky workshops). The bank of\nannealing ovens against the wall, in which the freshly formed glass pieces are\nslowly cooled down to room temperature, look something like industrial\nrefrigerators but have a working temperature of over 900 degrees Fahrenheit.\nNot for nothing is the space called a “hot shop.” Being in a glassblowing\nstudio makes it obvious just how much energy can go into creating objects.\n\nThe infrastructural networks that touch my daily life—electricity, natural\ngas, transportation, computation and telecommunications, water and sewage\ntreatment—all require energy to function. Natural gas and electricity networks\nprovide energy to be consumed at the point of use, in the form of heat and the\npower for appliances and devices. But the other important way in which we use\nenergy is in the form of physical objects, all of which require energy to be\nmanufactured and then transported to their destination. The panes of glass in\nthe window beside me don’t use any energy as they let the sunshine in, but\nglassblowing has made me aware of just how much energy went into creating\nthem. There’s the energy needed to power the furnaces that heat the glass so\nit can be shaped into useful objects, and upstream of that is all the energy\nthat was needed to mine the sand and other minerals and process them into the\nraw glass. At the other end of the manufacturing process, every object has its\nshare of the energy to move the finished goods through transportation and\ndistribution networks to where they’re used. Glassmaking might use energy in\nan especially glamorous way, but a similar calculus applies to the fabrication\nof _every_ object, as flimsy and disposable as a tissue or as immovable and\npermanent as a highway interchange.\n\nMy colleague Benjamin Linder works in sustainable design, and he introduced me\nto this idea of embodied energy by running a workshop for students in my\nundergraduate materials engineering course. Ben brought in a variety of\nsingle-serving drinks sold in packages made of different materials, including\nCoca-Cola in curvy plastic, Red Bull in a slender aluminum can, and Perrier\nmineral water in its pear-shaped green glass bottle. The students carried out\na simplified life cycle analysis for the drinks by calculating the\nenvironmental impact for each beverage container. It incorporated a number of\nfactors, including the impact of obtaining the raw materials, shaping them\ninto a bottle or can, and, once filled, shipping them to campus. (One of the\nimportant things that our students learn from the workshop is that\nunderstanding and quantifying the full impact of a product or process gets\nmore challenging as more elements are considered, and that accounting for the\nholistic impact is likely impossible.)\n\nGoing through this exercise made me really think about what it took to\nfabricate the containers themselves. For example, the process of refining the\naluminum for the Red Bull can—separating the metal atoms from the oxygen atoms\nto which they’re tightly bound—requires electricity in such enormous amounts\nthat researchers who work in sustainable design describe the material as\n“solid energy.” The ore is shipped from wherever it’s mined to aluminum\nsmelters which, like data centers, are typically located to take advantage of\nabundant and inexpensive electricity. This is also why recycled aluminum has\nonly a small fraction of the embodied energy of first-use aluminum—the energy\ninput required to refine the metal in the first place is so high that the\nprocess of forming it into new shapes requires a proportionally much smaller\namount of energy.\n\nWhen we ran the analysis, I came to understand that the environmental impact\nof manufacturing the containers was only one element of the total impact of\neach single-serving drink. The label on the glass bottle of Perrier proudly\nnotes that the water is bottled near the source in France, which means that\nthe filled container crossed several thousand miles of ocean on a container\nship before being put on a truck and driven to the store where Ben bought it\nto bring to our lab. The transportation of the heavy beverage, nearly all of\nwhich was powered by the combustion of diesel, turned out to be the biggest\ncontributor to its total environmental impact. (Realizing this permanently\ntipped my drinking habits in favor of sparkling water bottled closer to where\nI live!) Infrastructural systems make it easier for us to consume energy in\nthis subtle way, as embodied energy over the entire life cycle of a product:\nin the extraction and distribution of the raw materials, in the manufacturing\nand distribution of the product, and in its disposal—whether landfilled,\nrecycled, or upcycled—at the end of its useful lifetime.\n\n## Infrastructure Is Power\n\nAs a many-armed infrastructure goddess, then, my hands reach out and touch a\nnumber of different systems: electricity, water and wastewater, fuel,\ntransportation, telecommunications, supply chains for goods, and systems for\nthe removal of solid waste. I described myself as powerful, but it’s not in\nthe sense of the magical, much less the divine. It’s in the extremely\ntechnical engineering sense of using power, a _lot_ of power, defined as\nenergy consumption per unit time.\n\nAccess to grid electricity, in particular, is remarkably close to having power\nin that most abstract, scientific sense. While combustion has long been the\nprimary energy source for infrastructural systems, electricity has\nincreasingly become the way in which we distribute and use that energy.\nTransmission lines make it possible to use electricity hundreds or thousands\nof miles away from where it’s generated, and once electrons are moving through\nthe electrical grid, they are perfectly fungible. To the end user, it doesn’t\nmatter if the power came from a coal-fired generating station, a nuclear\nplant, a hydroelectric dam, or solar panels on the roof of a house. That\nflexibility makes it possible to evolve the energy mixture on the grid over\ntime, as by phasing out fossil fuels and bringing in new sources, including\nrenewables. But it’s the specific characteristics of electricity, especially\nafter two centuries of unrelenting innovation and development, that make it so\nastonishingly versatile. Electricity can be used at virtually any scale, from\nthe microscopic to the huge, and it can be converted into many different kinds\nof energy to be used in different ways. That means that it can be used to\npower everything from the raw mechanical forces of giant container cranes to\nthe tiniest glimmers of light from microscopic diodes, to produce both blazing\nheat and frigid cold, the sound effects in children’s toys, and the sensors in\nlife-saving medical equipment. It’s revealing that we say things like “the\npower went out.” Access to adequate, reliable electricity is having\nunrestricted power on tap.\n\nEven if we’re not using it in as direct a form as electricity, our power\nconsumption is largely mediated by infrastructural systems because they’re the\nmain way in which we access a share of the energy generated and harnessed for\nhuman use. All physical systems are in some way or another about energy—how\nit’s sourced, transformed, distributed, and consumed. The “developed” world,\nin contrast with the “developing world,” are the places where technological\nsystems powered by energy sources have largely replaced (and often vastly\naugmented) human labor.\n\nLike all living creatures, people need energy to live, and we get that energy\nfrom the chemical energy stored in the food we eat. While it’s a messy,\nimperfect conversion, we can estimate our power consumption from daily caloric\nintake, since calories are a unit of energy and days are a unit of time, and\nit works out to roughly the same as a modern television, 100 watts or so. Most\nof that energy goes to power all the biological processes that keep us alive\nand healthy, and some of it is used to move our bodies around. That power\nconsumption also defines our maximum output, because we can’t put more energy\nback into the world than we can get from our food except over short\nperiods—this is why you need to eat more if you exercise regularly or\nintensely. So we can think of that baseline human energy usage as about the\nequivalent of having a television on for twenty-four hours a day.\n\nBut of course, most residents of industrially developed countries can look\naround and see that we use a lot more than a TV’s worth of power every day. We\nuse power inside our homes, in our schools and workplaces, as a share of all\nthe energy used in the different spaces we pass through, as the power needed\nto move between them, and more. It’s this largely unrestricted personal access\nto energy—whether directly or via various systems—that frees us from spending\nthe bulk of our time on providing for the material survival needs of ourselves\nand the people around us. It defines what it means to live in the modern\nworld, where it’s possible to do routinely what would have been unthinkable a\ncentury ago or even just a generation ago.\n\nToday, the per capita power usage of U.S. residents is somewhere around 9 kW\n(a bit over 12 horsepower)—about a hundred times the power consumption, and\nhence output, of our bodies alone. It’s among the highest in the world,\ncomparable to Canada, Australia, Norway, and a handful of other countries.\nSome of that energy, like the embodied energy in manufactured objects, we\nmight never directly observe. Some of it we only ever use collectively, like\nthe electricity that powers telecommunication networks or mass transit. An\nastounding amount of it is under our direct control, in our homes or our\nprivate vehicles. And all of the energy that’s needed to make infrastructural\nsystems function has to come from _somewhere_.\n\nIn the U.S., as for the world as a whole, about 80 percent of that energy is\nprovided by the combustion of fossil fuels. Over the past two centuries, human\nsocieties have built out global systems to extract, distribute, and consume\nenergy (and materials) on a fully industrial scale. Like all technologies,\nthese systems incorporate the values of their builders. Many infrastructural\nsystems, like municipal water supplies, include ideals like serving the public\ngood and universal provision, or meeting the basic needs of everyone in a\ncommunity. But some of the values are far less laudable: the social and\nenvironmental costs of high-quality infrastructural systems for one group are\noften borne by others who are not in that group. Above all, the quality of\nlife that’s made possible by a high per capita energy footprint comes with a\nprofound disconnect between those who benefit the most and those who bear the\ncosts. The short-term geopolitical implications of this encompass the violence\nand suffering associated with protecting access to coal, oil, and gas\nsupplies. But we’ve also known for a hundred years that the combustion\nproducts of fossil fuel contribute to anthropogenic climate change, with\neverything that means for land use, food production, and more. And while the\neffects of greenhouse gases are global—we share the atmosphere and oceans\nafter all—neither the level of energy consumption that led to them nor the\nimpacts that will result are uniformly distributed. The per capita power\nconsumption of Bangladesh, for example, is among the lowest in the world at\n0.3 kilowatts, about one thirtieth of the U.S. As a low-lying coastal area in\nthe tropics, the country is among the most at risk from sea level rise,\ntyphoons, and flooding. And because of the close relationship between wealth,\nenergy usage, and infrastructural systems, countries like Bangladesh have the\nfewest resources to mitigate or respond to the destructive consequences of\nclimate change caused by the use of energy that they didn’t even benefit from.\n\nEnergy usage has come at tremendous cost, with impacts that are still\nunfolding. But at the same time, infrastructural systems have provided access\nto energy and so enabled historically unprecedented levels of agency to more\npeople, especially women. What might our world look like if, no matter where\nyou happen to have been born, you had enough energy at your disposal to meet\nbasic needs—light, fuel for cooking, energy to warm or cool your home, clean\nwater—as well as for transportation and communications? What kinds of\ninfrastructural systems—not just environmentally sustainable, but resilient\nand globally equitable—would make this world possible?\n\nEnergy is the currency of the material world. The cost of doing, making, and\nmoving might be paid for with money, but it’s priced in energy, and energy has\nhistorically been scarce and expensive. Infrastructural systems have been\nbuilt to reduce the amount of energy needed to accomplish a goal (like getting\nclean drinking water to everyone in a city), to reduce the cost of that energy\n(like building pipelines to deliver oil or natural gas), or because access to\nenergy made new ways of using it possible (like telecommunications). In other\nwords, infrastructure often effectively makes energy more abundant, or\ncheaper, or both. Networks are a powerful tool for these kinds of\nefficiencies, which is one reason why they are so closely associated with\ninfrastructure and, conversely, a big part of why infrastructural systems are\nintrinsically collective. Before we can answer the two questions posed above,\nthen, we need to dive more deeply into understanding how and why\ninfrastructural networks function the way they do.\n\n\n# Three\n\n# Living in the Networks\n\nThe flounder is a funny-looking fish.\n\nFlounder look like they’ve been squashed flat, and in a way, they have\nbeen—like many of their fellow flatfish, they’re born with the familiar\nsymmetrical fish shape. But as they grow, they change shape in preparation for\ntheir bottom-dwelling lifestyle. They become lopsided. Their bodies flatten\nout. One side pales, and speckles appear on the other to match their sandy\nseafloor home. The eye that would otherwise be on the underside migrates to\nthe upper side, leaving the fish noticeably cockeyed. All of which means that\na flounder is instantly recognizable, even when it’s cast into steel on a\nstorm drain cover at the curb of a street in downtown Boston, alongside the\nwords:\n\n> DON’T DUMP\n>\n> DRAINS TO\n>\n> BOSTON HARBOR\n\nFor much of the twentieth century, Boston Harbor (and the Charles River that\ndrains into it) was famously noisome, as immortalized in the Standells’ 1965\nhit “Dirty Water,” which Boston sports fans still sing when their team wins.\nFifty years later though, the water is surprisingly clean—clean enough for\nabundant wildlife, including night herons in the river and seals in the\nharbor. Swimming in the Charles is still not a great idea, but when I was\nlearning to kayak in Boston Harbor a few years ago, I mostly just had to worry\nabout getting upright again every time I capsized and not about what a\nmouthful of seawater might do to me.\n\nSea kayaking in the crowded and busy harbor means learning to use landmarks to\nnavigate, and one of the most recognizable sits across a narrow channel from\nthe flat expanse of Boston Logan International Airport, looking for all the\nworld like giant eggs in a carton. This is the Deer Island Wastewater\nTreatment Plant, and it’s an important facility to those flounder, who have\nbreeding grounds just offshore and who were in dire straits for a long time.\nThe plant opened in 1968 to treat sewage from the whole region, and then was\nupgraded a number of times to meet increasingly higher standards for the\nwastewater it discharged to the harbor. Over the decades, the flounder have\nmade a comeback.\n\nWhy do flounder have such a place in my heart? Besides being delightfully\nweird in their own right, the flounder on storm drains are a whimsical but\neffective reminder that we’re embedded in infrastructural networks. Standing\nin downtown Boston, surrounded by skyscrapers and office workers, the very\nspecificity of the fish tells us that we’re part of a larger system. It’s an\narrow of causality, telling us that if we dump paint down the drain _here_ ,\nit will end up with the flounder (and the sea kayakers) _there_. Water, and\nsewage, flows downhill.\n\nMathematicians describe networks, in their simplest and most abstract forms,\nas a set of connections between nodes. Infrastructural networks bring us what\nwe need to survive and thrive: water, of course, and energy in the form of\nelectricity and fuel. They take away what’s unsafe or unpleasant, like sewage.\nAnd they connect us to each other, through transportation and communication,\nlinking people and places together into a single whole. The completion of a\ntranscontinental rail link, thousands of miles long, is one of the founding\nmyths of both the United States and Canada, and the telegraph wires strung\nalongside the tracks provided the earliest near-instantaneous communication\nacross each country.\n\nThe physical connections that make up many infrastructural networks—the\npipelines and cables, the sewers and ducts—are largely invisible, especially\nin urban areas, where they’re often buried. Even when elements of the networks\nare in plain sight, they have a combination of ubiquity and banality that\nmakes it easy to not really see them for what they are. The only mobile phone\ntowers that I reliably notice are the ones that are disguised as trees. But\nwhile we mostly don’t see the networks themselves, what we can easily see are\nthe nodes, the points where we tap into them. When I’m standing in my kitchen,\nthe faucet and drain are nodes on the municipal water network and on the\nsanitary sewage system, respectively; the nodes on the electricity grid are in\nthe form of power outlets and light sockets, the blue flame on my stove is my\nnode on the network of utility gas pipelines, and my phone jack and cable\noutlet are nodes on a global telecommunications system.\n\nAll infrastructural networks rely on energy to function, because _everything_\nneeds energy to function, but not all of them use energy in the same way.\nUnderstanding networks—how they function, what they have in common and what’s\ndifferent between them, how they relate to energy—is a key part of\nunderstanding why infrastructural systems were built out the way they were and\nwhy they work the way they do. The networks are more than the nodes, and to\nstart seeing them, and seeing them as a whole, I had to get out of my kitchen.\n\n## The Power of Flow\n\nOver the course of the last few years, I’ve traced out most of my local\nmunicipal water network from end to end. For the water I drink at home, it’s\nonly about ten miles from the source to my tap, and then a few miles farther\nfrom the drain to the ocean—a scale that makes it pretty straightforward to\ngrasp the system as a whole. I’ve taken my students to visit the town pump\nthat provides water to our suburban college and gone to one of the regular\nopen nights at my local water treatment plant at Fresh Pond in Cambridge. My\nfriend Matt and I spent a day mountain biking along an aqueduct that was built\nto bring water into Boston from the reservoirs west of the city. My local\nstorm drains don’t all have flounder on them, it turns out, just the ones that\ndrain to Boston Harbor. Others are labeled as draining to local rivers, like\nthe Charles or the Neponset, and they show _different_ fish, each a local\nfreshwater species that make their home in that specific river. And, after\nseeing it from the harbor and from the air all those times, I went to visit\nthe Deer Island Wastewater Treatment plant.\n\nWhen I arrived at the facility, at the very start of our tour, our guide\nhanded around a small, sealed glass jar. Inside it was a sample of the\neffluent that was flowing beneath our feet and into the plant. I had kind of\nexpected sewage to be runny brown sludge, for obvious reasons, but at first\nglance, it just looked like plain water. I had to look carefully to see a\nfaint yellowish tinge. Deer Island—technically no longer an island, since it\nwas expanded with landfill and connected to the mainland—is almost at sea\nlevel, the lowest point around. If we dilute the waste enough (as we do each\ntime we flush a toilet), the sewage will flow steadily downhill to the plant.\nA few well-placed pumping stations help it along, but gravity does most of the\nwork.\n\nTo find the source of my drinking water, then, I head inland and uphill.\nCambridge sends its sewage to the regional facility, but the city has its own\ndrinking water supply. The reservoir is about seven miles northwest, visible\nfrom Interstate 95, the highway that circles around metropolitan Boston. I\nalways notice when I’m going past because it’s where signs warn winter drivers\nthat it’s a low-salt stretch of highway; minimizing the salt in the runoff\nthat goes into the reservoir keeps it out of my drinking water. Cambridge’s\nwater supply is also part of a redundant system: it’s connected (via an\nunderground valve near my home) to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority\nnetwork, the larger water system that serves Boston proper and many of the\nsurrounding communities (and which also manages the downstream sewage side,\nincluding the Deer Island plant). The water for the regional system comes from\ntwo reservoirs, one about forty miles due west of the city and a larger one\nabout twice as far west again, in the Berkshire Mountains. Whenever possible,\nwater sources tend to be uphill of cities in order to make the most of\ngravity. San Francisco’s water comes from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, high in\nthe Sierra Nevada Mountains, inside Yosemite National Park. The billion\ngallons that New York City uses every day come from a dozen or so reservoirs\nupstate, mostly west of the Hudson River, in the Catskills.\n\nOn a muggy May afternoon, I went to visit the oldest of New York’s reservoirs,\nin Croton-on-Hudson, just twenty or so miles upriver of the city. It was the\nSunday of a holiday weekend, and the long, narrow picnic area of Croton Gorge\nPark was full of family groups enjoying the day. As I walked past them in\nturn, I heard chatter in Spanish, Hindi, and other languages that I didn’t\nimmediately recognize, and I couldn’t resist looking at the tables to see the\nspreads of food from different cultures. The “back” of the park is a massive\nwall, the New Croton Dam itself. Built of buttressed blocks of stone, it looks\nfor all the world like the ramparts of a castle except that instead of a moat,\nwater cascades down the spillway at one end, where the regular curving\nterraces of the structure gradually merge into the jumbled rocks of the river.\nI followed a steep, narrow path to the top of the wall, where its true\nidentity as a dam became clear. In front of me, a narrow stream of water\ndanced and played on its way down the picturesque waterfall. To my left, the\nwall of the dam dropped precipitously to where, far below, tiny figures\ncontinued to enjoy their outings. To my right, its surface just a dozen or so\nfeet below where I stood, was a small lake. It was conspicuously serene—no\nmotorboats, no kayaks, not even swimmers. I looked back and forth from the\nwater next to me to the ground hundreds of feet down and started to feel a bit\ndizzy. My vertigo was compounded by the realization that the dam, however\nsolid and sturdy, was all that kept the placid lake next to me from becoming a\ncrushing tsunami and overwhelming the happy picnicking families below. I shook\nmyself a little, and reminded myself that the dam had already stood for a\ncentury and a half. Also, since it’s still part of the New York City water\nsupply, it would be regularly inspected and maintained. The undisturbed water\nwas no accident, of course. Even though the reservoir now provides only a tiny\nfraction of the city’s needs, access is prohibited.\n\nMy childhood was full of family picnics that closely resembled the ones I saw\nthat day in Croton, and once, probably while my father was barbecuing tandoori\nchicken and my mother was managing the rest of our meal, I decided to see what\nwould happen if I blocked up a nearby small stream. I took off my shoes and\nsocks and stood ankle-deep in the water, happily selecting rocks from the\nstreambed and lining them up across the current. Then I looked up, and was\nstartled to see that the water upstream of my little “dam” was already knee-\ndeep, getting higher and wider right in front of my eyes. I hastily pushed the\nbiggest of the rocks away before the flooding got any worse. That was my\nearliest real lesson in hydrology: not only does water flow downhill, but you\nreally can’t _stop_ it from flowing downhill. The best you can usually manage\nis to change the direction. But the flip side of this is that’s also all you\nhave to do to get the water to go where you want, and it doesn’t take much.\nIt’s like a judo move for energy—you can redirect its own power.\n\nAlong with drainage, the intentional channeling of water is therefore among\nthe earliest of human activities that we would recognize as infrastructure,\nwhether it’s irrigation along the Nile, aqueducts in Rome, or the cascading\nnetwork of storage tanks across South India. Properly constructed and\nmaintained aqueducts don’t need any additional energy to function. Before AD\n1300, the Hohokam people built an extensive irrigation system in which\nnetworks of canals diverted river water for agricultural use over an estimated\n110,000 acres and supported the largest pre-Columbian population in the desert\nSouthwest, in the area that’s now the cities of Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa in\nArizona. Three millennia later, 97 percent of New York City’s water flow is\npowered by gravity as it heads downriver from the Catskills all the way to the\nmouth of the Hudson. Once the reservoirs and aqueducts were designed, built,\nand opened, water from upriver began to deliver _itself_ to the metropolis. To\nan engineer and a scientist, this is such a satisfyingly elegant solution!\nWhether as small as a single-serving bottle or as big as a tanker truck,\ndelivering water in discrete quantities is expensive and inconvenient. It\nrequires so much more energy than simply leveraging landscapes, gravity, and\nthe way that water will flow merrily along whether it’s in rivers or in pipes.\n\nThe flow of water through a network can move more than the water itself, and\nthat energy—hydropower—can be turned into useful work. The heart of the city\nof Lowell, about twenty-five miles north of Boston, sits inside the triangle\nformed by a sharp bend in the Merrimack River and a canal that cuts across it.\nIt was planned and built as an industrial center and is crisscrossed by canals\nlined with textile mills. Today, parts of that downtown core are a national\nhistoric site, and I took the train up one morning to walk along the canals\nand visit some of the old mills, now museums. One of the mill floors is set up\nas it would have been during Lowell’s heyday in the 1850s, when it was the\nlargest industrial complex in the U.S. Raw cotton, grown by enslaved people,\nwas sent north and transformed into fabric (including “Lowell,” the name for a\ncoarse weave that was shipped back south to clothe those same people). The\ndemonstration floor was loud, loud enough that I was glad I had picked up a\npair of foam earplugs from the dispenser at the entrance. Between the noise\nand the long, closely packed rows of equipment, it took me a moment to realize\nthat only a small fraction of the machines were in motion. In the middle of\nthe nineteenth century, the operators were mill girls, young women drawn in\nfrom the surrounding countryside by the opportunities of independent\nemployment. The power for the factory floors full of looms, carders for raw\ncotton, and the other machinery necessary to manufacture textiles at scale\ncame from waterwheels spinning in the current of the canals, with the motion\ntransmitted and distributed to each apparatus by complicated systems of shafts\nand belts.\n\nThe river flows and the waterwheels spin 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The\nwater could be channeled to where it would be used but the mills, and the\nentire town of Lowell for that matter, were built exactly where they were as a\nmeans of bringing together the energy of the flowing water and the machinery\nto use it. In the early nineteenth century, that energy could only be\nharnessed and moved around the mill via a physical connection, those shafts\nand belts. Turning a machine “off” meant detaching it from the motive source.\nIf municipal water supplies don’t require much energy to deliver water once\nthey’re built out, this went one step further: the flowing water delivered\nenergy right to the factory and then to the factory floor. What’s more, it was\nfree. And then, at the end of that century it became feasible to convert\nhydropower into a form of energy that flows even more readily through a\nnetwork: a spinning turbine connected to a generator produces electricity.\n\nWater can divide and subdivide itself as it flows, distributing itself over a\nregion. We see this in natural watersheds, where tiny rivulets and majestic\nrivers all find their own paths downhill, diverging and converging as they go.\nMunicipal water and sewage networks are an artificial watershed overlaid on\ntop of—and under—the city. Water mains and pipes subdivide the flow of clean\nwater to buildings, and sanitary sewers carry wastewater away, often combining\nthe flow with the runoff from the gutters, drains, and stormwater sewers. But\nelectricity flows so well that it moves readily through transmission networks,\npower lines, and house wiring. It can also be divided and subdivided on much\nsmaller scales, delivering power to the point of use inside buildings, inside\nmachinery, and even inside computer chips. Every electrical circuit, whether\nvisible from space or only under a microscope, is a network.\n\nThis gets us to the first reason why networks are so important when we think\nabout infrastructural systems. If it can flow, whether poorly like crude oil,\nincredibly well like electrons, or even intangibly like data, a well-designed\nnetwork is an efficient way to move it around, almost always requiring less\nenergy than delivering the resource in discrete units, whether those are\nbatteries charged with electricity or carboys full of water. Once you’ve gone\nto the (not inconsiderable!) trouble of building the pipes, getting ten quarts\nof water is just about as easy as getting one quart, and even having ten\nbuildings connected to the network isn’t much different from connecting just\none.\n\nThat issue of flow also differentiates between concrete infrastructural\nnetworks, like water, the electrical grid, and telecommunications, and\ndistribution networks in the form of supply chains, like the ones that bring\nfood to the city. Fresh produce grown at a farm would typically be trucked to\na packing plant to be sorted and packed and then sent on to distribution\ncenters to be packaged into discrete units, whether punnets or pallets. These\nare then transported by truck, rail, or even air to a local distribution\nhub—the New England Produce Center is about five miles from where I live,\nacross the Mystic River in Chelsea, in an area of Boston that’s dominated by\ntransportation links and logistics—and then out to local supermarkets. If a\nstore puts in an order for ten boxes of cantaloupes instead of one, it will\ntake more space in a truck, more fuel, and more labor to get them to the\nproduce aisle. There are economies of scale to be had, and certainly having\nthe well-defined pathway of a supply chain makes everything simpler and\nsomewhat more efficient, but the energy costs of transportation still\ncorrespond closely to how much gets moved around and how far it goes.\nCantaloupes might roll, but they don’t _flow_.\n\n## Networks, Density, and the Power of the Collective\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, New York’s demand for water was outgrowing\nthe local reservoirs and wells, and the city began to build a public system to\nbring in clean drinking water. I think of municipal water as the\nquintessential infrastructural system: it needs a large upfront investment of\nresources to build out a transmission and distribution network, which then\ndrastically reduces the amount of energy required to deliver water and so\nreduces the cost of provision. It’s a human survival need, so every household\non the network benefits from easy access to water but also, because waterborne\ndiseases like cholera are contagious, from the _universal_ provision of clean\nwater. In late nineteenth-century Boston, this public health argument—that\ntheir own families would be safer and healthier because fewer people around\nthem would be sick—was what convinced the wealthier residents to use their\ntaxes to pay for a municipal water system and, new for the time, a sewage\nsystem to take the polluted wastewater away. It’s also when the growing city\nbegan requiring all new housing developments to have water and sewage lines.\nToday, it’s why improved water sources and sanitation facilities, including\npiped water on the premises, are considered to be the most basic of municipal\nservices worldwide. Informal settlements in cities are defined, in part, by\nnot having full access to these services, with the term “slums” reserved for\nthe most deprived and excluded households.\n\nThere’s nothing magical or inevitable about municipal water supplies, but the\nlogic is clear: when people live in proximity to each other, the most energy-\nefficient thing we can do, and thus the lowest cost for everyone, is to source\nwater in quantity and to build a network of pipes to channel it as it runs\ndownhill, with offshoots that deliver it where it’s needed. We can also build\nits mirror image, like veins to arteries: pipes that collect the wastewater\nfrom every household and channel the sewage downhill to where it’s discharged.\nAs drinking water and pollution standards were raised, centralized water and\nwastewater treatment plants were brought online. The significant—often\nimmense—initial commitment of resources required by these systems implies two\nthings. First, that the community that is building them has those resources\nand the capacity to work together to marshal and apply them. And second, that\nit’s willing to make an investment in the present in order to better meet the\nneeds of the community into the future. Not for nothing is “indoor plumbing” a\nmetonym for civilization.\n\nThe same thing that makes it a challenge to get clean drinking water in a\ncity—lots of people living close together—transforms into a virtue once you\nhave a network. Bigger networks—that is, ones with more nodes—amortize the\ncost of building out the network and any centralized facilities over a greater\nnumber of users (which was likely part of the motivation for building a single\ngiant wastewater treatment plant for the entire Boston area). And the denser\nthe settlement, the closer the nodes are to each other, making it easier to\nconnect them up. Together, these two features are more than just economy of\nscale. They characterize an economy of networks, and help explain why\ninfrastructure is so closely associated with cities. When population centers\nlike New York City began to bring in water from outlying reservoirs, those\naqueducts were the beginning of a network and those economies began to kick\nin.\n\nConversely, however, if the potential users of a service are far away from\neach other, it becomes more challenging and expensive to connect them. Solving\nthis “last-mile problem” was part of the impetus for the Rural Electrification\nAct of 1936. Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal included a program for nationwide\nelectrification by building out dams, power plants, and transmission lines,\nwhich also provided employment to workers left jobless by the Great\nDepression. Federal loans for local power distribution were made available,\nbut widely spaced farms weren’t seen as a viable market by the mostly city-\nbased utility companies. Instead, farmers banded together to create local\nelectricity cooperatives. By 1959, 90 percent of farms were connected, up from\njust a few percent at the start of the program. To this day, most rural\nelectricity in the U.S. is supplied by not-for-profit co-ops that got off the\nground with this federal funding. In 1949, the act was extended to cover phone\nlines and then, half a century later (2008 and 2014) provisions for broadband\nInternet access for rural areas were added. The last-mile problem means that\nthese regions were (and many still remain) underserved by investor-owned\nproviders.\n\nFlow, size, and density all contribute to making networks a highly effective\nway to move resources around, from both an energy and an economic perspective.\nBut the connections between nodes can matter too—where they go, how far, and\nwhat happens when they’re disrupted.\n\n## Bottlenecks and Interconnections\n\nAcross the ocean from my home, on a glorious spring day, I took the train\nnorth out of London to the town of Tring, in the Chiltern Hills, to walk in\nthe footsteps of our Bronze Age ancestors.\n\nRoads are perhaps the oldest systems that we would recognize as\ninfrastructure. Humans have created paths for their entire existence as a\nspecies, just as other animals do, and for the same reason: as anyone who’s\never gone for a hike appreciates, it takes less energy to follow an existing\ntrail than it does to create a new one. The act of following it often makes\nthe trail wider or more distinct, and easier still to follow—to borrow the\nwords of Paulo Freire, we make the road by walking. That morning I was on the\nRidgeway, a trackway that humans have been using for five thousand years. The\nfields and villages of southern England stretched out below me, a patterned\ngreen carpet under a blue sky. Besides yielding breathtaking views of the\ncountryside, the high ground made it easier to travel without getting bogged\ndown in mud. On the western side of the Atlantic Ocean, the Natchez Trace\ntraverses Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi and is among the oldest\nsurviving routes in North America, estimated to date back ten millennia. Roads\nare a staple of postapocalyptic futures, too. Even in fictional settings where\ncivilization has collapsed and cars rust in heaps, networks of roadways still\nprovide routes across the landscape.\n\nIf we think about infrastructural systems as moving resources to where we want\nto use them, then they are inextricably about location on the landscape,\nspecific points on the planet. At a minimum, those points are _us_ —for all\nthat we talk about being online and in the digital sphere, each of us has a\nbody that is located in a particular place in the world. In other words, we\nare all nodes. And even the simplest connections between nodes forms a\nnetwork. That’s the kind of connectivity that roads enable.\n\nIn the United States, one of the largest countries in the world by land area,\nit’s almost hard to appreciate the value of these connections. It’s not just\nthat good roads and highways reduce the time and cost required to move goods\nand people around. At an even more basic level, it’s mostly taken for granted\nthat almost any point in the country is on the road network. When I moved to\nSeattle for a year, I didn’t think about _whether_ my new apartment, three\nthousand miles away, was reachable by car from the street that I could see out\nmy window in Cambridge. I just had to figure out what route to take. In\nnetwork science terms, that means that the American road network is mostly\nconnected. There are a few exceptions, of course, like islands. When I left\nthe Honolulu airport after the long flight over the Pacific from Los Angeles,\nI couldn’t help but laugh at road signs that were the familiar blue-and-red\nshields of an _interstate_ highway. It’s when I first learned that these\nhighways are defined by federal funding and adherence to a set of design\nstandards, not whether they cross a state line, and also that they’re\nofficially “interstate and defense highways”—which might help explain their\npresence in Hawaii, home to military bases, including Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe less obvious exceptions to the general connectedness are “practical\nexclaves,” places that aren’t directly reachable from the rest of the country.\nAlaska is a practical exclave, but so is the tiny town of Point Roberts in the\nstate of Washington—like Alaska, it’s only accessible by sea or by going\nthrough Canada, and it’s long been rumored to be a popular place for Americans\nin the Federal Witness Protection Program to settle because getting to it by\ncar from elsewhere in the U.S. means going through two border crossings.\n\nEven if it’s not on an island or in an exclave, each point in the network of\nroads is not as well connected as every other. East of Seattle, Interstate 90\nclimbs up through the Cascade Range at Snoqualmie Pass. As one of only two\ninterstate highways into the region, it’s a critical link, carrying nearly\nthirty thousand vehicles every day. I’ve lived in places with snowy winters\nfor nearly my entire life. But it was only during that year in Seattle that I\nlearned how to put chains on my tires. If I wanted to go snowboarding when it\nwas snowing, I’d have to go through a checkpoint where state police officers\nconfirmed that every vehicle headed toward the pass had good traction. My\nfamiliar Boston end of I-90 is embedded in a network of surface roads, so\ntraffic can be routed around accidents on the highway. At the Seattle end,\nwhere the mountains limit the city’s connections, anything that obstructs the\nhighway is a much bigger logistical headache. It made sense to ensure that\ndrivers headed up from the rainy coast were prepared for the snowy conditions.\n\nHeaded north from Seattle, the U.S. road network merges seamlessly with\nCanadian roads at the border. I’ve taken the train between Seattle and\nVancouver, British Columbia. It’s a stunningly gorgeous route, with high\nmountain peaks on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other. The western\nrail lines were built with the same kind of tracks (standard gauge, with rails\n4 feet, 8½ inches apart), so railcars have always been able to move freely\nbetween the two countries—for all that it crosses a national border, it’s a\nsingle network. In contrast, before the U.S. Civil War, trains in the American\nSouth mostly ran on a broad gauge, with rails five feet apart. Some cities\nlike Montgomery, Alabama, were served by two different rail companies, with\nseparate stations on different gauges. That meant that transshipping goods\nbetween the two networks involved the time-consuming and expensive process of\nunloading everything from the first train, transporting it across town in\ncarts, and then reloading it into railcars on the other line. On top of this,\nmany of the rail lines in the South were isolated railway spurs dedicated to\ntaking cotton from the fields to the ports, rather than the much more\nconnected network of the North. This lack of connectivity had a severe impact\non the ability of the Confederate States to move soldiers and supplies during\nthe Civil War. After the war ended, trade between the North and South\nincreased and the hassle and cost of the break of gauge became increasingly\nuntenable. In 1886, after months of planning and preparation, all of the broad\ngauge southern track was changed to standard gauge in just thirty-six hours:\ntens of thousands of workers pulled up one rail of the track, moved it a few\ninches closer to the other, and spiked it into its new position. Railcars got\nnew undercarriages, and the two separate smaller networks became a single,\nfully interconnected, national network.\n\nWhen the networks that allow people and goods to move around easily are\ndisrupted, as by a natural disaster, this process is reversed and communities\ncan find themselves as tiny, isolated networks. In September 2017, the main\nbridge for the rural community of Rio Abajo in the Utuado region of central\nPuerto Rico was washed out by Hurricane Maria. In the immediate aftermath of\nthe storm, residents ran a line across the river, and suspended an open wooden\nbox from it by pulleys, just large enough for one person. It was the most\ntenuous thread of connection to the networks, systems, and supply chains of\nthe larger world. Without power, young locals took turns pulling the box\nacross, hand over hand, to carry residents across the river to the main road,\nand to bring food and other basic supplies to the residents of Rio Abajo.\nIncluding, of course, cases of bottled water.\n\n## Networks and Directionality\n\nInfrastructural networks are effective ways to move resources around because\nthey allow for flow (and the energy efficiencies that result), and they\nbenefit from density. But the directionality of the flow in networks also\naffects the kinds of value that it can provide to each user.\n\nThe gas stove in my kitchen is the old-fashioned kind, which means that every\nonce in a while, I come home to the faint but unmistakable rotten-egg smell of\nmercaptan, the chemical compound that’s added to natural gas for just this\npurpose: it makes even tiny gas leaks, as when a pilot light has blown out,\ndetectable. (Large, dangerous leaks are unignorable, the olfactory equivalent\nof a blasting alarm.) Utility gas goes on a one-way trip. It’s carried through\ngas mains to local lines to the building I live in, then to my stove, and then\nto the burner where it meets its fiery end under a saucepan. The molecules of\ngas are then transformed, producing the heat that I need to cook my food in\nthe process of being converted into (mostly) carbon dioxide and water vapor\nand released into the air. Grid electricity works this way as well. It needs a\nclosed circuit for current, but the actual energy goes on a one-way trip, from\nthe power station where it’s generated to the point of use where it’s turned\ninto a different, useful form of energy—like light, heat, sound, mechanical\nmovement, or something else—and dissipated.\n\nWater doesn’t evaporate when it arrives at my apartment, but it still makes a\none-way trip that ends in a transformation. It might even happen in a split-\nsecond of freefall: what comes out of my faucet is potable water, but when it\nreaches the drain just below, it’s wastewater. The water started its journey\nat the reservoir and arrived at my home via a network of water mains and\npipes. As sanitary sewage, it continues to flow downhill, converging on ever-\nlarger pipes until it arrives at Deer Island to be treated and returned to the\noutside world via diffusers that look like giant salt shakers sitting on the\nbottom of Boston Harbor, nine miles away from shore. The whole way, it’s all\ntraveling in one direction. Natural gas, water and sewage, cable TV, and the\ncirculatory system for blood in our bodies—which functions in almost exactly\nthe same way as water and sewage—are all examples of one-way networks. While\none-directional networks can have many nodes that are close together, those\nnodes aren’t connected to each other: the sewage that goes down my drain never\ntouches other homes, at least not unless something has gone very badly wrong.\n\nBut other kinds of networks allow for connections _between_ nodes, and that’s\nwhat makes them useful. Back when they first came out, it only made sense to\nbuy a fax machine if you already knew at least one other person who had one so\nyou could send messages back and forth, if only to that person. But as the\nnumber of people with fax machines—the nodes in this network—increased, the\nnumber of connections between them increased rapidly: with two fax machines,\nonly one connection is possible, but with three fax machines, there are three\npossible connections; with four machines, six. With only five machines, there\nare ten different connections possible; by the time you get up to ten\nmachines, there are 45 different ways to connect them. The numerical\nrelationship between the nodes and the ever-increasing connections between\nthem (on the order of the square of the number of nodes) was codified as part\nof Metcalfe’s law, named after Robert Metcalfe, one of the inventors of the\nEthernet communication protocol for computers. Metcalfe argued that the value\nof a network to its users—whether fax machines, phones, or computers—increased\nproportionately with the number of connections to each node. The more possible\nconnections there are, the more valuable it is to _each_ user.\n\nNodes on one-way networks are like leaves on the spreading branches of a tree,\nbut two-way connections create something more like, well, a net. When all the\nnodes are connected to each other, the possibilities quickly explode. Roads\nand other transportation networks work like this, as do communications\nnetworks, including postal mail, telephones, and the Internet. Not only do\nusers benefit from being connected to the network themselves but also, broadly\nspeaking, individuals benefit from having more users on the network: more\npeople and places that they can connect with, talk to, visit, send goods to,\nand so on. So the more people who have access to the system, the better off\neveryone is individually. This is also true for potable water and sanitation,\nbut for a different reason: because waterborne diseases are contagious, each\nindividual person is safer if fewer people around them are sick. We’re now\nstarting to edge into why infrastructural systems are often considered public\ngoods. The value of connectedness is a driver for networks to be as large and\nas widely adopted as possible, whether by making them available to more users\n(more nodes) or by making them interoperable and so forming a larger network\n(as when railways moved to a single gauge).\n\n## Scaling Up Networks\n\nThe water and sanitation systems where I live are charmingly small, almost\nquaint. From the reservoir where my drinking water comes from to the point\nwhere the treated wastewater is discharged into the ocean is about the same\ndistance as the Boston Marathon. Much of the network was designed and built a\ncentury or more ago, so it’s largely gravity fed, not needing much additional\nenergy to function. It’s a human-scale system, which is part of what made it\nso easy and fun to explore, by car and bike and subway and sea kayak. But it’s\nalso something of an anomaly. Most infrastructural systems don’t lend\nthemselves to being apprehended so easily or completely, not even ones as\nseemingly straightforward as water provision.\n\nA few years ago, I spent a May weekend driving around California with my\nfriend Charlie Loyd, an expert in satellite imaging, to explore different\nparts of the state water system, including a visit to the San Luis Reservoir,\nthe fifth-largest in the state. It’s in the mountains above Interstate 5 due\neast of Santa Cruz. We parked at the side of the adjacent road and walked down\nto the water’s edge, listening to the low drone of wind turbines on the ridge\nblending with the susurration of the drought-yellowed grass all around us,\nintermittently enlivened by birdsong. We were standing in an interlocking\nsystem of rivers, dams, reservoirs, pumps, aqueducts, and canals that spans\nmany states—seven in the Colorado River consortium alone—and thousands of\nmiles, reaching south to the border with Mexico. Household usage only makes up\na small part of it; the system also delivers water for agricultural\nirrigation, including the thirsty but enormously productive Central Valley in\nCalifornia, and produces hydroelectric power, as at the seventeen generating\nturbines at the Hoover Dam in adjacent Nevada. The water doesn’t just flow\ndownhill: the California Aqueduct, for example, goes up and over the Tehachapi\nMountains, thanks to the Edmonston pumping station. Fourteen six-story-high\npumps can push two million gallons of water per minute up two thousand feet at\nthe highest single-lift plant in the world, helping to make the California\nState Water Project the single largest consumer of energy in the state.\n\nThe year after visiting the reservoir, some other friends and I walked the\nfull fifty-mile length of the Los Angeles River over the course of a long\nweekend, from the western San Fernando Valley south to the Port of Long Beach.\nOn our first day, we stopped at the William Mulholland Memorial Fountain and\npoured some Los Angeles tap water on the marker for the man who was the\nprimary architect of the city’s water supply but whose legacy is complicated,\nto put it mildly. As chief engineer of the city water system, he oversaw the\nconstruction of the Los Angeles and the Colorado River Aqueducts that bring\nwater to the city from hundreds of miles away. Mulholland was also responsible\nfor the St. Francis Dam, which failed catastrophically in March 1928, sweeping\nhundreds of people to their death.\n\nWe were walking the length of the river in part because it’s a tiny piece of\nthe California water system that _is_ on the scale of our bodies, something\nthat we _could_ encompass. While a few stretches of the riverbed are\naccessible and safe, people have generally been discouraged from entering the\nriver, and definitely from following it on foot for three days straight. The\nwaterway is lined with concrete for most of its length and serves as a storm\ndrain for the city, collecting rainwater that runs off many square miles of\npaved-over urban landscape and carrying it out to the Pacific Ocean. That\nsprawling urban watershed makes the channelized river susceptible to flash\nfloods. Late in the afternoon of our second day of walking the river, it\nstarted to rain—nothing serious, just a gentle patter. We were in a stretch\nwhere the channel was narrow and the walls on either side of us were vertical,\na human-made slot canyon. The water was deeper than our hiking boots, and we\ncouldn’t know if there was more coming from behind us. If there was, it could\narrive fast and hard, and the steep walls meant we wouldn’t be able to get out\nof its way.\n\nAt the San Luis Reservoir, as Charlie and I walked down to the shoreline, the\nground beneath us abruptly became mostly bare rock and soil, with a few small,\nfast-growing plants, lost fishing lures, and patches of mineral salt. We were\nthere in the spring of 2015, and that last fifty paces or so to the water’s\nedge was an ongoing drought made visible. It was what the absence of nearly 40\npercent of the reservoir’s capacity looked like. But that water wasn’t missing\nbecause of the weather conditions per se. It was missing because the reservoir\nis part of a much, much larger system. As networks become physically larger\nand technologically more complex, with greater energy demands, the social\ncontext can similarly become more and more complicated. Understanding even\njust the legal issues around water in California itself is a lifetime’s study.\nWhile talking through what we had seen over the course of that weekend,\nCharlie and I landed on the term “ultrastructure” to describe this web of\nsocial structures, all of the cultural, political, regulatory, and other\nsystems that shape and govern infrastructure. In this case, that would include\nwhere the water gets delivered, and how it’s used, and by whom. Drought or\nnot, filling the reservoir or not, what made it “missing” water was that it\nwas part of the human system of ultrastructure, promised to someone for their\nuse. Networks are inherently collective, not individual. They are about doing\nthings together, which means that they are necessarily shaped by social\nsystems. But the converse is also true: technologies develop into\ninfrastructural systems because of the evolving roles they play in our lives.\n\nEight months later, my friends and I in the Los Angeles River were\nfortunate—we shouldered our packs, put our heads down against the rain, and\nkept moving at a brisk pace until the river channel again widened out into\ngentle sloping banks. When it finally did, we only needed to walk a few feet\nout of the water before we could breathe a sigh of relief that we hadn’t wound\nup on the wrong side of a system whose behavior we only understood\nimperfectly. Larger, more complex systems are harder to understand, in part\nbecause they can behave in counterintuitive ways, especially when they\ninteract with human systems and preferences. What’s more, infrastructural\nsystems aren’t isolated from each other. They often depend on other\ninfrastructure to function, at least road access and power from the electrical\ngrid, but they can also be deeply entangled with each other. Researchers talk\nabout the “food-water-energy nexus” because of the close relationship between\nthe three, especially in places like California, where agricultural production\nis linked to the electricity grid: the same water irrigates fields, generates\nelectricity, and consumes energy as it moves through the system.\n\nFor all of its uniqueness, water in California is also typical of many of the\ninfrastructural networks that we are embedded in. They are huge in extent,\nspanning multiple jurisdictions, and incorporate elements that are physically\nenormous and that require significant amounts of energy to function. They’re\nalso fiendishly complex, often under continuous oversight in order to balance\nmultiple competing needs. One story of infrastructure in the twentieth century\nis how these systems went from small-scale networks—conceived and overseen by\narchitects like Mulholland and largely comprehensible in their entirety by\nindividuals—to the ones that surround us today. Thinking of infrastructure as\nphysical systems of networks and energy is only part of what we need to\nunderstand them as they exist today, much less the directions they’ll be\ntaking in the future. They are also human systems that incorporate particular\nways of seeing, organizing, and acting in the world.\n\n\n# Four\n\n# Cooperation on a Global Scale\n\nOne of my very favorite sounds in the world is made by split-flap displays,\nalso known as Solari boards after a well-known manufacturer. The “screen”\nshuffles to show each of the letters and numbers in a row of text, pauses to\nshow the information, and then shuffles again— _clickety-clickety-clickety—_\nto reflect updates. When I was growing up, these were the standard displays\nfor arrival and departure information at train stations and airports, but\nthey’ve become rare. While bright digital screens are more flexible, they\nupdate silently, without providing that environmental cue to waiting\npassengers to look up and see what’s changed.\n\nAmong the few remaining Solari boards that I know of is the one in the\ngorgeously rebuilt San Francisco Ferry Terminal on the Embarcadero, and\nwhenever I find myself in the city, I try to go across the bay from there to\nOakland. I buy my ticket and listen to the sound of the ferry times and\ndestinations updating while I wait to board. No matter what the weather is\nlike during the trip—cold and wet or sunny and warm or, seeing as it’s San\nFrancisco, all of the above—I stand on the deck so I can take in the Pacific\nOcean, the Marin Headlands, and the beauty of the city in its setting. As the\nferry steams away from shore, a neon sign catches my eye, glowing red and\nspelling out the words hills brothers coffee on a large brick building at the\nwater’s edge. It’s a ghost sign, a holdover from the city’s heyday as a port,\nwhen ships loaded with sacks of beans would arrive and the coffee would be\nunloaded and roasted before being sent onward to the rest of the U.S.\n\nMany similar late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century buildings located\nnear the shoreline in San Francisco, with their high ceilings, exposed brick,\nand large windows, were once warehouses. The area is recognizably kin to\ndistricts found in other cities in North America, not just on the seacoasts\nbut also in Chicago, Toronto, and Minneapolis on the Great Lakes. Ships\narrived and tied up at the docks, and stevedores would unload the break-bulk\ncargo, the barrels, boxes, bags, and bundles stowed in the hold to send them\non further by land. In the other direction, goods arriving at the port by\ntruck or rail were loaded onto ships for the next stage of their journey. All\nof this required time and coordination. Goods needed to be sorted and stored\nwhile waiting to be loaded for transshipment, which is where the warehouses\ncame in. As shipping traffic grew during the first half of the twentieth\ncentury, the docks and warehouses became busier and busier, hives of activity\ntwenty-four hours a day. But then, in the late 1960s and early 1970s,\nwarehouse districts began to hollow out. In the U.S. and Canada, as elsewhere\nin the world, they stood empty or were informally occupied for decades, by\nsquatters or as live/work spaces by artists. The resurgence and growth of\nurban centers and the attendant rise in property prices incentivized the\nzoning and redevelopment of warehouses for residential or commercial use. In\nSan Francisco, that meant loft spaces for galleries and tech startups, and\nalso tech giants—the former Hills Brothers Coffee roasting plant is now home\nto Google offices.\n\nThe explanation for why all of these warehouses emptied out half a century ago\nis more clearly apparent at the other end of that ride from San Francisco.\nAfter sailing under the Bay Bridge, the ferry enters a narrow channel lined\nwith shipping cranes that look for all the world like giant spindly steel\nbeasts at the water’s edge, necks extended to drink. For the last ten minutes\nor so of the ride we glide past the docks of the Port of Oakland. I always\ngawk at the huge ships with their multicolored boxes.\n\nThe invention, refinement, and uptake of the intermodal shipping\ncontainer—those standardized, stackable steel boxes—changed nearly everything\nabout transporting goods. Containers could be filled and sealed at the factory\nand transported to the docks by truck or train, then loaded by crane onto\ncargo ships, stacked on the deck and locked into position for the voyage. On\narrival, the same process happens in reverse: cranes lift the containers from\nthe ship and place them directly onto truckbeds or on trains, so the cargo can\ncontinue overland to its destination. Containerization meant that the labor-\nintensive, time-consuming, and sometimes “leaky” (it was easy for loose cargo\nto go missing) process of unloading or loading ships at the docks became much\nfaster and required fewer workers. Instead of manual labor, the energy for\nmoving the cargo is provided by the container crane, occasionally from diesel\ngenerators but usually as shore power, from the electrical grid. Despite\nstrong resistance by labor unions, within about twenty years almost all cargo\nin the world was containerized.\n\nIntermodal containers made it possible to seamlessly connect two wildly\ndifferent worlds, maritime shipping and ground transportation. The move to\ncontainerization reshaped cities as shipping traffic relocated to ports that\nwere more compatible with these new modes and those ports grew larger in turn.\nThe inconvenience of transporting cargo overland out of peninsular San\nFrancisco made the mainland more attractive, which led to those vacant\nwarehouses on the west side of the bay and container cranes in Oakland. That\nease of transferring containerized goods between ships and trains or\ntrucks—needing less time, labor, and warehouse storage—meant that maritime and\noverland transport networks effectively merged into a single, transmodal\nnetwork. Containers didn’t just lower the cost of shipping—they all but\neliminated it. Transportation costs became negligible, no longer a barrier to\nworldwide distribution. Suddenly, it didn’t really matter where a product was\nmade, or how far away the factories were. Once the process of transferring\ncontainers from ships to ground transport was swift and reliable, long-\ndistance supply chains suddenly became feasible. International trade\nagreements soon followed and global trade exploded.\n\nStandardized shipping containers created a low-friction planetary-scale\nnetwork for physical goods. This would turn out to be a key element of\nglobalization, including the idea of “offshoring,” eventually reshaping\ncommunities worldwide. We’re still sorting through the consequences of this.\n\n## Standards as Enabling Global Cooperation\n\nIf we’re embedded in networks that span the globe, that means there must be\nsome way to coordinate across them so that people can cooperate on their\nfunction despite living in different places, speaking different languages, and\nhaving different cultural backgrounds. Much of this coordination happens via\nstandards, which are carefully defined and agreed-upon ways of interacting\nwith, well, everything, but especially technological devices and the material\nworld.\n\nIt’s a movie cliché that when someone wakes from unconsciousness, their first\nquestion is “Where am I?” and the second is “What time is it?” Global mapping\nand standardized time are so deeply foundational to how we think about time\nand space that it’s easy to forget that they aren’t inherent to the world.\nThey’re standards, and they came out of the growth and spread of\ntransportation and communication networks.\n\nThe clocks at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich have served as reference\nstandards for navigation since the late seventeenth century, when the first\nchronometers made it possible for sailors to calculate their longitude\nrelative to the prime meridian. Despite this, every place in Great Britain\nstill set its time independently. Local noon was based on the highest point of\nthe sun in the sky, which varied by tens of minutes across the island. As\ncities began to be connected by rail—swifter, serving more people, and on\nfixed lines—the increased risks of collision meant that the time differences\nbecame dangerous as well as cumbersome. Beginning in 1840, railway companies\nbegan to run their operations on a standardized time. Initially, staff hand-\ncarried synchronized portable chronometers on the trains to disseminate\n“railway time” to stations, but within fifteen years, timekeeping signals were\nsent out from Greenwich by telegraph. Over the course of the next half century\nor so, the growth of rail networks across Great Britain drove the adoption of\na single time across the island. The modern system of time zones gained\ntraction worldwide as undersea telegraph cables and then radio transmissions\ncemented near-instantaneous communications channels across the far-flung\nBritish Empire. By 1929, universal standard time had gone global:\nsynchronization within each time zone, with a fixed offset based on the\nlongitude relative to the prime meridian.\n\nIn parallel with the spread of a coordinated time system, the nineteenth\ncentury also saw the rise of mapping. Beginning in 1747, the British Army was\ncommissioned to make its first maps, initially to aid in finding dissenters\nand quelling military uprisings in the Scottish Highlands. (To this day, the\nUK mapping agency is known as the Ordnance Survey.) Through the middle of the\nnineteenth century, all of Ireland, England, and Wales were surveyed and\nmapped, largely for taxation but including higher-resolution maps of urban\nareas to support the construction of municipal water and sewage systems. The\ncommercial possibilities of maps were quickly recognized. Railways and other\ncompanies pressed the government to create more and better maps, and to make\nthem broadly available. Across the ocean, the American Revolution ended with\nthe Treaty of Paris in 1783. Nearly the first thing the new government did to\nassert control over the newly ceded territory was to commission a cadastral\nsurvey—a map that showed how the land was to be divided up into discrete\nparcels, a shared system in which to describe and sell it. The surveying\nprocess continued alongside U.S. territorial acquisition, first the Louisiana\nPurchase of 1803, followed by western expansion through the nineteenth\ncentury. The rectangular grid that the survey produced, each square a mile on\na side, was used as the basis for the colonization of the western half of the\ncontinent by European-descended settlers, and it still literally shapes how\nthe land is used today. At night, from the air, the work of the surveyors is\nvisible as a sparse, orthogonal grid of lights. I can always tell when I’m\ngetting close to home on a cross-country flight, because the orderly squares\nof the western U.S. begin to transition into the dense, irregular network of\nroads and streetlights of the northeast. On the other side of the planet, the\nGreat Trigonometrical Survey of India was begun in 1802 and would also\ncontinue through most of the century. British surveyors lugged half-ton\ntheodolites from the southernmost tip of India, Kanniyakumari (then known as\nCape Comorin), all the way up the spine of the subcontinent to the Himalayas\nand Mount Everest, measured as part of the survey and named after an earlier\nSurveyor General of India. Defining this “Great Arc” was part of a scientific\nquest to determine the exact shape of the planet, but mapping the subcontinent\nwas primarily a commercial and a military imperative for the East India\nCompany and then for the British Raj. On all three continents, mapping was a\nmeans of increasing legibility—knowing what was on the ground, and where—as a\nway of increasing control and access to resources.\n\nThe glowing blue dot on my phone that tells me where I am today is the product\nof a later iteration of the same story. The Global Positioning System (GPS)\nrelies on a constellation of satellites that can triangulate the position of a\nspot on the earth in order to locate it precisely. To do this, it depends\nequally on the exquisitely accurate geodesic model of the planet that evolved\nfrom those nineteenth-century trigonometrical surveys and on fantastically\nprecise clocks, in satellites and their ground stations, that are the\ndescendants of those Greenwich-synchronized railway chronometers. Developed by\nthe U.S. military, GPS was first opened to civilian use in the late 1980s\nafter a commercial Boeing 747, Korean Airlines Flight 007, drifted off course\nand into prohibited airspace over what was then the USSR, where it was\nmisidentified as military reconnaissance and shot down with no survivors.\nInitially, only a degraded version of GPS was made publicly available, with\n“fuzzed” data that reduced the precision to a few hundred feet. But, as with\nhigh-resolution maps in England two centuries earlier, the commercial value of\nGPS became clear and in 2000, the full precision of less than a foot, and even\ndown to a fraction of an inch under some circumstances, was made available to\nall users.\n\nI think of these two systems, time and mapping, as the infrastructure for\ninfrastructure. Their growth in extent and precision has paralleled and\nenabled the infrastructural networks that rely on them. Today, they make up a\nunified, precise, global system for locating points in time and space that\nunderpins virtually all other forms of technological and social coordination.\n\nShipping containers are a physical instantiation of a standard: they are the\nright size and shape and have the right fixtures to be lifted by a crane and\nsecured in place on a container ship, a truck, or a train. As long as the box\nitself has the right physical properties, including its dimensions, mass, and\nrigidity, the actual contents are largely (and usefully) immaterial. Standards\nare what make it possible for different systems to connect with each other and\nwork together. Time and mapping are the keystones, but standards of every sort\ncan be found everywhere, quite literally. Within arm’s reach of where I’m\nworking, I have a desk calendar with dates, clocks showing the time, and a\nlamp with a lightbulb, power plug, and USB outlets. My papers are a standard\nU.S. size, 8½ inches by 11 inches, and the sheets fit in the printer I have at\nhome and in those I use on campus. There are hundreds of different technical\nstandards implemented in my laptop, and I’d imagine at least as many in my\nsmartphone. Even the butter on my toast is governed by a standard: I wondered\nwhy butter in the UK and Europe tasted better than at home in the U.S. and\nlearned that the minimum allowable milkfat percentage is higher. The\nInternational Standards Organization, a nonprofit oversight body, has defined\nmore than _twenty thousand_ standards, which means there’s almost certainly a\nstandard that’s relevant to anything anyone might want to do, including one\nfor my cup of tea (ISO 3103).\n\nSince standards are used to make systems work together smoothly, we mostly\nonly notice them when there’s a mismatch. When I moved from Canada to the\nU.S., and then from Boston to Seattle, I brought household appliances with me\nwith no concerns about whether they’d work in their new location or, worse,\nthat they’d be dangerous. When I moved to London, though, I left them all at\nhome. Besides using differently shaped plugs, wall outlets in the UK are at\ntwice the North American voltage and deliver correspondingly higher power. I’m\nreminded of this every time I’m visiting and put an electric kettle on,\nbecause it comes to a boil startlingly faster than I’m used to. Unlike\nhousehold appliances, though, electronic devices like my computer and phone\nare on a global standard. It’s why they usually come with swappable chunky\nadapters that transform the high voltage and alternating current of local wall\npower to the lower voltage and steady direct current that they run on.\n\nPayment systems, including credit and debit cards, adhere to international\nstandards so that they function in many different places as long as there’s\naccess to a telecommunications network and the electricity to power it. Cash\nitself is rarely interoperable across national borders: regional currencies\nlike the euro are among the few notable exceptions. The closest thing to a\nglobal currency standard is still the U.S. dollar, so much so that hundred-\ndollar bills are reportedly the most counterfeited in the world. But it’s the\n_idea_ of money—that you can exchange money in some form, however concrete or\nabstruse, wherever in the world you are, for whatever goods or services you\nneed or desire—that might be the most important international “standard.” It’s\nthe default structure of cooperation that’s used on a global scale and it’s\nwhat makes it possible to operate networks that cross almost every sort of\npolitical boundary.\n\nA unified global system lets a passenger plane land in Chicago or Lagos or\nBeijing and safely take off again. Standards provide a way to hide, and\ntherefore manage, the complexity of systems. At least in principle, and mostly\nin practice, as long as the relevant element adheres to a mutually agreed-upon\nset of rules, the specifics of just _how_ those rules are met doesn’t have to\nbe taken into account.\n\nStandards are also a key element of infrastructural systems because the\ndecision to do things the same way, or at least interoperably, is often what\nmakes it possible to scale networks up. It’s how the standardization of rail\ngauge made the northern and southern networks in the U.S. into a single,\nnational railway network. Standards are why the U.S. and Canada can share a\nroadway network and an electric grid across state, provincial, and national\nborders, and standards are how shipping containers unified maritime and\noverland transportation networks globally.\n\nBut there’s a third, more subtle way in which standards underpin\ninfrastructural systems. Over the past century or so, infrastructural networks\nhave grown in spatial extent, from localized systems to ones that now span the\nglobe. The growth of these networks has been accompanied by a change in\nscale—nearly every element of these systems is bigger and consumes more\nenergy—and by a corresponding increase in technological complexity. Standards\nmake this complexity possible.\n\n## Higher and Higher: The Trajectory of Technology\n\nOne February morning, I woke up before dawn to go watch the arrival of the\nship CMA CGM _Benjamin Franklin_ at the Port of Oakland. It had launched just\na few months earlier, in December 2015, and was making a round of visits to\ndeepwater ports on the U.S. west coast. The _Benjamin Franklin_ is among the\nlargest container ships in the world—at just shy of four hundred meters from\nbow to stern, it has a carrying capacity of 18,000 twenty-foot equivalent\nunits (TEUs), the standard unit of measure for intermodal containers. As the\nsun rose, the ship’s quarter-mile length came down the channel and a pair of\ntugboats snugged the vessel up to its berth beneath the container cranes of\nthe port, ready to be unloaded.\n\nWhat makes this ship different from the cargo ships that once tied up across\nthe bay in San Francisco is not just the stacks of shipping containers on its\ndeck. There’s an important hint in the scale. Everything about it is vastly\nlarger than the ships of a century before, with the exception of its human\ncomplement—the _Benjamin Franklin_ carries just twenty-six crewmembers. If\nwe’re trying to understand the world of networked technological infrastructure\nin which we live, the networks are only part of the story. The other part is\nthe _technology_ itself—the physical systems, not just of the networks\nthemselves but all of the technological devices and facilities necessary for\ntheir operation and use, whether they’re container ships or electrical\nsubstations or cellphone towers or wastewater plants. Over the course of the\ntwentieth century, there was a profound shift in our material technologies. In\norder to recognize that shift and what it means, we need to think about what\ntechnology is and how technologies evolve over time.\n\nI enjoy knitting by hand, and my preferred needles are smooth bamboo, machine-\nmade and imported from Japan. But I don’t actually need specialized knitting\nneedles. It would be more challenging and less pleasant, but I could still\nknit if all I had was two straightish sticks. Similarly, I usually knit soft,\nbrightly colored machine-made wool, but I could instead use wool that’s been\ncarded and spun by hand and left undyed. I can imagine harvesting long grasses\nand braiding the fiber into “yarn,” or I could go lower tech still. Because\nhere’s the thing: even if all I had was two sticks and a length of vine,\npulled off a tree and stripped of leaves, I could still do something that is\nrecognizably _knitting_ , however messy and imperfect the result.\n\nIn _The Nature of Technology_ , W. Brian Arthur makes the case that all\ntechnology has three elements. The first is that there must be some physical\nphenomenon at its root. Money, for example, is _not_ a technology. It might\ntake the form of a string of seashells, or of printed pieces of paper, or of\nbits inscribed in a computer database, but the actual idea and function of\nmoney is independent of any specific physical phenomenon. Legal or educational\nor political systems might be enabling structures, but they are _social_\nsystems. Knitting, on the other hand, _is_ a technology because it relies on\nparticular physical phenomena. In order for me to knit, the needles and the\nyarn need to have specific material properties, so that I can use the stiff\nneedles to pass the long, flexible yarn over and around itself. The knitted\npiece that results is a large, flat knot, with physical properties (like\nstretchiness) that come along with that topological structure.\n\nThe second characteristic of technologies is that they are combined and\nassembled out of other technologies. Instead of knitting with two sticks and a\nlength of vine, I go to my local crafting store and choose what kind of\nknitting needles I want to use: steel or bamboo or plastic, small or large,\nstraight, double-pointed or circular. I can select from many different yarns,\nnot just wool but cotton, linen, silk, and a wide array of synthetic fibers\nlike polyester. If I wanted to crochet instead of knit, I would recombine\nthese technologies to create a new technology. I might use the same yarn, but\nI’d use a different tool: instead of straight needles, a crochet hook that\ncatches and pulls. I’d also use a different process, which would produce a\ndifferent kind of three-dimensional knot.\n\nThe third characteristic is, to my mind, the most interesting and subtle:\ntechnologies are _recursive_. If you look closely at any given technological\nartifact or process, you can observe that it’s created out of other\ntechnologies, and the same is true if you look more carefully at _that_\ntechnology, all the way down to some basic physical phenomenon. Even something\nas simple as a knitting needle can incorporate an extraordinary range of\ntechnologies in its manufacture. That might include growing the bamboo, or\npumping the crude oil and chemically transforming it into smooth inert\nplastic, or mining iron ore, refining it, and making steel, followed by the\ndifferent fabrication processes used to shape and finish the needles. We can\ntell similar stories about the yarn: different fibers might incorporate\ndifferent processes. For wool, they include raising and shearing sheep,\ncarding and spinning the wool before coloring it in a range of bright hues\nwith synthetic dyes, then gathering and packaging the yarn into the soft skein\nI pick out at the store. And if we look closely at any of these component\ntechnologies—from sheep husbandry to dye chemistry, even the hand-powered\nwinder I use at the store to turn the skein into a compact ball of wool—we can\nsee that each subtechnology is itself composed of further subtechnologies.\n\nThis becomes even more obvious when we go _higher_ tech. Industrially\nmanufactured knitted clothing is ubiquitous; I doubt there’s been a single day\nin the last year, maybe the last decade, that I didn’t wear something machine-\nknit, like a T-shirt or socks or leggings. A few years ago, I had the\nopportunity to visit a local textile mill, and even the relatively simple\nindustrial knitting machines on their factory floor were the size of a car,\ncost thousands of dollars, and required skilled operators and specialized\nmaintenance. But at their root they still relied on the same basic physical\nphenomena as hand knitting, of needles entangling yarn with itself into a\ncontinuous fabric.\n\nOnce we think of technology in this way, as combined and recursively assembled\nout of existing technologies, we can see why we can usually tell if a given\npiece of technology is older or newer. Technological development has a\ndirection, because complexity tends to increase, not decrease. Elements can be\ncombined in new and different ways: a shaft and gears can connect a waterwheel\nin a river to a roomful of looms in a textile factory instead of grindstones\nin a flour mill. A familiar physical principle can be used in a new way: even\nthough it’s been known since antiquity that steam could push on something to\nmake it move, it wasn’t until the steam engine that this behavior was\nharnessed to spin a turbine. A newly discovered physical phenomena can be\nharnessed, to new ends. In 1831, at the Royal Institution of Great Britain,\nMichael Faraday demonstrated that moving a magnet in a coil of wire creates an\nelectrical current. He went on to use this principle to build a dynamo, the\nearliest electrical generator. Put new discoveries together with the old, and\na new technology emerges. Burning coal to produce steam to turn a turbine that\nmoves inside a generator makes a rudimentary thermal power station. Or attach\nthe generator directly to a waterwheel, spinning in the\ncurrent—hydroelectricity.\n\nNewly discovered physical phenomena can also lead to completely novel\ntechnologies. Solar panels are made of materials that produce electricity when\nthey’re exposed to light, an entirely different process from Faraday’s\nelectrical generators. But new technologies also need to build on what’s\nalready in use. The photoelectric effect was first observed and described in\n1839, and the first rooftop solar panels in New York City were installed in\n1883, but the widespread adoption of solar panels in their current familiar\nform had to wait decades until all the associated technologies, like advanced\nmethods for refining high-purity silicon, were developed. This demonstrates\nthat the particular set of technologies available at any moment is\n_contingent_ —a different set of technologies in the past, or different\nscientific discoveries, or even the same discoveries in a different order,\nwould mean different technologies in use. It’s the premise of a lot of\nalternate history science fiction. At the same time, new technologies are\nbuilt to interface with existing systems, especially infrastructural\nsystems—to run on AC wall power, for example—which also shapes how they\ndevelop. There’s contingency but there’s also _continuity_. This path\ndependence means the infrastructural systems that are in use shape the\ntechnologies that are developed, and vice versa.\n\nI own a handknit wool shawl that I bought while visiting the Faroe Islands,\nmade of undyed wool from the hardy local sheep. The technology of hand\nknitting requires not just the yarn and needles themselves but also a\ntechnological practice, the knowledge of how to use the yarn and the needles\nto produce a knitted garment. My mother taught me the basics of how to knit\nwhen I was a child, and then I learned more from patterns, instructional\nbooks, and the occasional online video tutorial. In _The Real World of\nTechnology,_ Ursula Franklin describes such a practice as a “holistic\ntechnology,” one in which a single person understands and has the skills and\nautonomy to carry out every step of the process, closely related to the idea\nof artisanal labor. Even today, there are people who raise sheep, turn their\nfleece into wool, and knit the wool into garments.\n\nBut at the edge of my Faroese shawl is a row of buttons made of matte black\nplastic. There is no single human on the planet who can fabricate one of those\nbuttons from scratch, or who even fully understands all of the processes and\ntechniques involved: extracting the oil, refining it, overseeing the chemical\nprocesses required to transform it into a polymer, deciding on additives like\npigment and opacifiers to make up the final formulation of the plastic,\ndesigning the shape of the button, setting up the injection molding process .\n. . just a small subset of the skills and knowledge needed to create a plain\nplastic button. Over the course of the past century or so, most of the\ntechnologies behind the material realities of modern life in industrially\ndeveloped regions became far too complex for an individual to encompass,\nwhether as tiny and commonplace as a plastic button or as huge and complicated\nas a data center or a nuclear power plant. These artifacts and technological\nsystems are a product of social and organizational structures that enable\npeople with specialized skills to work together. Standards, in particular,\nmodularize and black-box all the different technologies and subtechnologies,\nmaking them manageable and interchangeable even without a complete\nunderstanding of their internal details, which in turn enables the advanced\ncooperation that makes larger technological systems possible. This is a\nsocietal shift that’s hiding in plain sight: most technological systems,\nincluding mass-produced material goods, are now products of collective, rather\nthan individual, intelligence. As a general rule, if it didn’t already exist\nabout a hundred years ago, it’s not something that a single person could fully\nunderstand or create today. The fabric of daily life is created from\ntechnologies that have outpaced our ability as individuals to fully understand\nor recreate them. And that includes the technologies that are the interfaces\nto infrastructural networks.\n\n## Size, Scale, Extent, and Complexity\n\nMy car is considerably more technologically complex than my bicycle,\nincorporating a much wider set of subtechnologies in its function. Pretty much\nevery element of my bike (the frame, the wheels, the brakes, the gearing and\ntransmission, even the bell) has an analogous system in my car, but the\nconverse isn’t true: my bike doesn’t have an internal combustion engine, or a\ncatalytic converter, or an air conditioner, or a stereo. Cars can go farther\nand faster than bikes because they generate more motive power than bikes do,\nmade possible by consuming gasoline as a source of energy, rather than relying\non the limited capacity of my leg muscles. More energy to move them means that\ncars can be bigger and heavier than bikes, which in turn means they require\nfar more energy to manufacture. This gives us a hint as to one of the drivers\nof increasing technological complexity: access to energy.\n\nA graph of the total exogenous energy usage of humanity (that is, energy from\nall sources outside our own bodies) over time is flat until about 1800, after\nwhich it becomes roughly exponential, starting slowly and then rising more and\nmore steeply. The largest share of that growth comes from the increasing\nextraction and combustion of fossil fuels. The very earliest commercial steam\nengines were used to pump water out of coal mines, which made it possible to\ndig out more coal. My colleague Ben Linder pointed out that it was a physical\nmechanism for exponential growth: these mechanical pumps could reliably turn a\nsmall investment of energy (from the coal burned to produce the steam that\npowered them) into a much larger amount of available energy (produced from the\nincreased amount of coal that was mined). As more energy became available, it\nwas used to create and power more, bigger mining equipment, first to extract\nyet more coal, then oil and natural gas. The energy produced was in turn\ninvested into building dams for hydroelectric power, into nuclear reactors,\ninto solar panels and wind turbines, resulting in the continuing exponential\ngrowth of total energy production and use. A system where much more energy\ncomes out at each step than was put in is behaving more like the runaway chain\nreaction of a nuclear bomb than the controlled simmer of a reactor core.\n\nThis exponential growth in energy usage both motivated and literally powered\nthe increase in technological complexity, not just in energy infrastructure\nbut everywhere. It used to take whole crews of longshoremen to unload and\nreload ships; now that work is done by a small handful of crane operators,\nmediated by a technological system that makes it possible to manage the energy\nrequired to move and stack ten-ton shipping containers. This technological\ncomplexity, energy usage, and network growth is self-reinforcing, resulting in\nsystems that function in ways that are not only, in the words of the song by\nDaft Punk, harder, better, faster, stronger, but also bigger, farther, and\nserving more people. And more functional, more reliable, and more\nspecialized—but also more centralized and more extractive.\n\n## Moving Bodies and Bits\n\nShipping containers created large-scale global networks for the transportation\nof goods, but the second half of the twentieth century also saw the rise of\ntwo other global networks: civil aviation for people and telecommunications\nfor information.\n\nMy parents emigrated from India to Canada in the late 1960s, and their arrival\ncoincided with a time of rapid (and continuing) expansion of air travel.\nImmigration was no longer a one-way trip. They could take their young family\nhome to visit extended family in Bhopal and New Delhi on a fairly regular\nbasis, and they did. I don’t even remember the first time I was on a plane,\nbecause I was too young. I do remember that, before I learned that the earth\nwas round, I had already deduced from my travels that all the different places\nin the world were stacked on top of each other, separated by clouds like\nlayers in a cake. This meant that you had to go up or down to get to them,\nwhich explained (to five-year-old me, at least) why you had to fly.\n\nChildish explanations aside, the growth in civil aviation—the jet age—was\nkicked off by and takes its name from the development of robust, reliable jet\nengines, which could be made larger and more powerful than their piston-engine\npredecessors. Half a century or so later, a modern passenger jet plane, like\nan Airbus A380, exemplifies the trajectory of technologies toward larger\nscale, more complexity, and more energy usage. It’s a staggeringly complex\nartifact in its own right; the design, manufacture, operation, and maintenance\nof a plane like this is only possible because of organizational structures in\nwhich hundreds or thousands of people with vastly different skills and\nknowledge collaborate and assemble technologies into something that reliably\nstays up in the air. As with container ships, modern passenger jets are bigger\nand can go farther than their predecessors: an Airbus A380 holds 525\npassengers and has a range of just over nine thousand miles, which means it\ncan fly nonstop between Hong Kong and New York City. This is made possible by\naccess to energy in the form of fossil fuels. In the case of a fully fueled\nA380, that means more than 250 metric tons of aviation kerosene, or somewhere\nnorth of 80,000 gallons. On a per-person, per-mile basis, though, an Airbus\nA380 gets better gas mileage than I do on my daily commute in a compact\nhatchback. A bigger plane with a longer range that carries more passengers can\ndo so more efficiently, and when fuel is a large chunk of operating costs,\nthat can mean more cheaply and more profitably.\n\nThe cost of passenger travel fell and the global middle class continued to\ngrow, resulting in a roughly fifteenfold increase in the number of air\npassengers worldwide since 1970, to about 4.5 billion passengers and something\nlike 40 billion commercial flights in 2019. Planes don’t exist in isolation,\nand this growth in air travel meant the commensurate growth and development of\neverything else that makes it possible for them to move safely around the\nworld. Commercial aviation leverages all the systems that I’ve\ndescribed—global navigation, coordinated and precise timing, standards, and\ninternational cooperation around every element of travel. This increase in the\naccessibility of personal mobility in the last part of the twentieth century\nand into the twenty-first—not just the proportion of people who travel, but\nhow often and where to—is part of what we mean when we talk about living in a\nglobally connected world, with perspectives informed by visiting other places,\nby being or living alongside immigrants, and by international trade.\n\nCompleting the trifecta of planetary-scale infrastructural networks is\ntelecommunications. Throughout history, the transmission of information over\nlong distances largely required the transportation of atoms: messages were\nnecessarily physical, like letters. The international mail system for global\ncommunications—reciprocal agreements to deliver mail regardless of which\ncountry’s post office was paid for the stamp—dates back to 1874. The advent of\ntelegraphy made it possible for communications to be pure signal, mediated by\nelectrons transmitted along wires and undersea cables. This was followed by\ntelephony, and then radio communications, first as telegraphy and now, a\ncentury later, as wireless networks. The final few decades of the twentieth\ncentury saw the rise of high-capacity long-distance telecommunications cables\nfor voice and for data. With these connections in place, the decentralized,\npacket-based routing protocols of the Internet facilitated global\ncommunications. In many places that were previously poorly served by telephone\nservice, wireless telecommunications have entirely leapfrogged landlines, with\nnear-complete penetration of cellular telephony and rapidly rising access to\nmobile data. The rise of digital telecommunications has made it possible to\nlargely decouple sharing information from sending physical materials in the\nform of letters or other documents. This was recently driven home to me when a\ncolleague was talking to our undergraduate engineering design class about a\nproject for bicycle couriers, and one of our first-year students put up their\nhand to ask, “What’s a bike courier?” Despite—or maybe because of—the way that\nthe vast majority of my communications are now digital and ephemeral, I’ll\nprobably always have a place in my heart for material, enduring postal mail.\nIt still remains remarkable to me that we have a publicly administered,\nglobally distributed, fully reciprocal supply chain for the one-to-one\ndelivery of physical objects.\n\n## Learning to See the Sublime\n\nHelen Macdonald, the naturalist and historian who talked about the “green\nblur,” also wrote about the times when their “attention has unaccountably\nsnagged on something small and transitory” in the natural environment and how\nthese elements serve as tiny portals, as long as the observer possesses a\n“sufficient quality of attention to see them at all. When they occur, and they\ndo not occur often, these moments open up a giddying glimpse into the inhuman\nsystems of the world that operate on scales too small and too large and too\ncomplex for us to apprehend.” The moment of noticing sparks Helen’s\nremembrance and awareness that they are surrounded by and embedded in the\nnatural world, of the sea and sky and the land and the ecological systems that\nconnect them through time, revealing the “numinous ordinary.”\n\nTheir account comes strikingly close to how I feel when I look at the three-\nletter airport code on a boarding pass and consider how a bar code grants me\npassage to the entire world. Or when I press a switch and think about how one\nwire goes to the lightbulb in my bedside lamp and the other wire goes hundreds\nand hundreds of miles, to a dam in northern Quebec or to a nuclear plant or to\na solar farm. Or when I look at the blue dot on my phone and realize that it’s\nlistening for signals from satellites and unimaginably precise clocks while\nI’m standing on the ground. The writer Tim Carmody has called this the\n“systemic sublime”—a parallel to Helen Macdonald’s numinous ordinary for\nhuman-created systems instead of the natural world.\n\nAll of these systems interact and are entangled with one another, not just in\ntechnical ways, like how a washing machine uses both electricity and water,\nbut in ways that are mediated by enormously complex social, legal, and\nregulatory systems. Many books have been written about water in the western\nUnited States, and many professional lives spent understanding the legal\nframeworks that have accreted over the course of half a millennium since\nEuropean colonizers began to settle the region. The food-water-energy nexus\nmeans that it’s not possible to consider any of these systems in isolation.\nThey are entirely situated in a sociotechnical context that includes the\ntechnical and environmental considerations and these human decision-making\nsystems.\n\nIn many ways, this is what we think of as being “modern,” particularly as\nresidents of a wealthy, economically advanced country. It means that our way\nof life isn’t constrained by the resources that are found in the immediate\nenvironment, and that everything we do is embedded in and enabled by global\nsystems of energy, trade, communications, migration, food production, and\nsupply chains. Because the existence and nature of these systems shape the\nkinds of things we can do and how we do them, the possibilities that are\navailable to us on a daily basis, how we feed ourselves and stay warm or cool\nor move around or have water for drinking and hygiene, that means that _we\nliterally don’t know how to live without them_. If you’re reading this book,\nyou’ve almost certainly had the feeling of glimpsing the systemic sublime, the\n_human_ systems of the world that, in Helen’s words, operate on scales too\nsmall and too large and too complex for us to apprehend, vast and seemingly\nunknowable. The brain-exploding insight, the one that we all live with whether\nwe acknowledge it or not, is this: for a large fraction of humanity, the ways\nwe meet our most basic needs, the ways we carry out the most routine and\nquotidian activities of our daily lives, and the material culture in which we\nare embedded are all _beyond our capacity to understand, or even fully\napprehend._\n\nBut this isn’t where we stop.\n\nIt’s easy to feel like we have no control or agency over these systems, that\nif we can’t comprehend how they work then we can’t predict their behavior,\nmuch less change them. But unlike the “numinous ordinary,” which describes the\nnatural world that has been evolving for many millions of years, the systemic\nsublime is about human-created systems. There is nothing natural or inevitable\nabout the way they work.\n\n## Shaping the Systems\n\nOther than roads and water systems, most of the networked infrastructural\nsystems that we interact with every day have only existed in recognizable form\nfor about two centuries, since the Industrial Revolution, because their\noperation depends on abundant and reliable sources of energy, harnessed by\nincreasingly complex technologies. The truly global nature of supply chains,\nmobility, and telecommunications has been in place for less than a human\nlifetime.\n\nFirst of all, this is remarkable: as a species, we’ve learned to cooperate\nwell enough that we marshal the resources to provide for the daily needs of a\nsubstantive chunk of the world’s population, in the billions, and we do it\nwell enough that many of those people don’t even have to think about how it\nhappens. But just like it’s easy to never think about a specific\ninfrastructural system until it fails, it’s easy to never think about\ninfrastructural systems _as a whole_ unless we are in a position to recognize\nthe ways they restrict what we can do or to observe the ways in which they\ncause harm. What’s _also_ changed within a human lifetime is that even the\nmost privileged users of these systems—I’m absolutely one of them, of\ncourse—are now unavoidably bumping up against these negative effects,\nespecially the understanding that the combustion products of fossil fuels are\ndriving anthropogenic climate change. It’s this realization—that we want to\ninteract with these systems differently—that immediately leads to that\ncreeping or even overwhelming feeling that we do not understand them and that\nthey are too big and complicated and entangled for us to have any control or\nagency over how they work.\n\nBecause these infrastructural systems are about moving resources through a\nnetwork, changing with time and incorporating feedback loops, they can behave\nin ways that aren’t immediately clear, or that are even counterintuitive. But\nthat also means that human choices shape these systems every day, day after\nday—they change and respond over time as people interact with them. Roads are\na familiar example. We might think of them as inert and passive, channeling\nthe flow of traffic like aqueducts carrying water. A bigger aqueduct can move\nmore water, but if the same logic is applied to highways—adding extra lanes in\na bid to reduce traffic congestion—it doesn’t work. Instead, the number of\nvehicles quickly increases to match the carrying capacity of the new road—a\nphenomenon known as induced demand—until the congestion is just as bad as\nbefore. Flowing water molecules are channeled blindly, governed by the\nmathematical equations of fluid dynamics, but traffic is the result of\nthousands or tens of thousands of individual drivers making decisions every\nday about how smooth or aggravating or long their commute will be, and\ndecisions over the course of years about where they live and work.\n\nHumans aren’t really great at understanding and interacting with these kinds\nof systems, largely because they can behave in ways that are far more\ncomplicated than simple cause and effect, even if it’s just water molecules. A\nfive-year-old understands that if you put a stopper in the drain and turn on\nthe faucet, a bathtub will first fill and eventually overflow—it’s a\nstraightforward, one-way network (it’s also why sinks and tubs commonly have\noverflow drains). But connect together a bunch of bathtubs with a bunch of\npipes—each with its own faucet and drain, all connected so that the water that\nleaves one bathtub might go to a different one—and the system is not only more\ncomplicated but also its behavior becomes much harder to predict, especially\nin response to changing circumstances like turning off specific faucets or\nstopping up particular drains. Where will the water go? Which bathtubs will\ndrain entirely, and which will overflow?\n\nJust because the ways in which they behave aren’t obvious doesn’t mean that\nthey aren’t knowable. In her essay “Holy Water,” Joan Didion described her\nvisit to the Operations Control Center for the California State Water Project\nin Sacramento. It’s one of several agencies that move water around the region,\nbetween reservoirs, through dams, and along aqueducts, and the operators have\na nuanced understanding of the system, a huge, complicated, constantly\nchanging, high-stakes set of networked bathtubs. Grid operators do the same\nkind of work with electricity, matching production and distribution to demand\non a moment-by-moment basis. Induced demand has been carefully studied by\ntransportation researchers, who’ve demonstrated that however counterintuitive\nit seems, the correlation between more and wider roads and increased traffic\nis predictable and quantifiable.\n\nThe researcher Donella Meadows pioneered the field of studying these types of\nnetworked, time-dependent systems, which describes much of our infrastructure.\nShe points out that deterministic, analytical tools can’t necessarily capture\ntheir behavior. Rather, like complex ecological systems, they reward long,\ncareful observation. Sometimes that understanding comes just from paying\nattention as we go about our daily lives. I’ve driven the easternmost stretch\nof the Massachusetts Turnpike—Interstate 90, between the city of Boston and\nthe ring road of Interstate 95—most days of the year for the better part of\ntwo decades now. I know the behavior of traffic on that highway like a\nriverboat captain would have known the Mississippi—I know where the current\nruns fast, where it runs slow, and the dangerous spots where it changes from\none to the other. I know how that flow changes in the summer, in the winter,\nin rainstorms and Red Sox games, and during a global pandemic. Observational\nunderstanding over time is a powerful tool to get a handle on how these\nsystems work.\n\nDidion wrote that visiting the operations center made her want to be, herself,\nthe one who opened the valves and closed the gates to move water all around\nthe state. Humans are really, really oriented toward storytelling. Given that\nwe live inside our own heads, walking around, doing things, and having things\nhappen to us—a narrative, in other words—it’s not surprising that stories that\ninvolve individuals progressing through time and moving through space would be\npart of the basic human tool kit for making sense of the world. We are\nsolipsistic narrative-generating machines. But when you’re interacting with\ninfrastructural systems, individual considerations often don’t count for much.\nMy friends joke about how I have “good airline karma” because of how\nconsistently lucky I’ve been at avoiding flight delays and cancellations. A\ngood chunk of it is improbable and random, for sure, but it’s also rooted in\nthat deeply internalized understanding that civil aviation is a set of giant\ninterlocking systems, and I’m only the tiniest part of it. Having some\nunderstanding of how airlines work has served me in good stead, but the first\nstep is learning to see collective systems as, well, _collective_ systems. I’m\npart of it as a passenger, but so are the staff, whose behavior and\nflexibility within the system is likely even more constrained since their\nlivelihood depends on it. I’ve only witnessed a “Do you know who I am?”–style\nmeltdown at a gate a couple of times. They’re rare because most adult humans,\neven when they’re upset, do understand that their needs or desires don’t\noutweigh those of a passenger jet full of people. It’s the same idea as\n“You’re not stuck in traffic, you _are_ the traffic.” We can consciously\nsidestep the narrative solipsism of thinking we must be the hero of the story\n(or that _anyone_ is) and the attendant fallacy that the systems are there to\nserve us individually or specifically, rather than as part of a collective.\nIt’s even more evident when they fail in some way—weather, mechanical issues,\nscheduling glitch—because it affects that entire passenger jet full of people\nand cascades onward from there.\n\nAlongside the idea that individual decisions result in collective outcomes (as\nwith traffic) or that individuals have relatively little power in collective\nsystems (like when they’re late for a flight), is the idea that individuals\ncan indeed act collectively, and that we can use new tools to do so. One of\nthe most powerful examples I’ve seen of this came on September 6, 2022,\nseveral days into a heat wave in California. As predicted, demand for\nelectricity had set an all-time record for the state, early in the late-\nafternoon peak, and was still rising. Just before 5:30 p.m., the power grid\nwent to the highest emergency level: nearly every scrap of reserve capacity\navailable in the system was spoken for. If demand exceeded supply, it would\nmean rolling blackouts. I was keeping an eye on the grid operator’s page and\nsomething odd happened. Just before 6 p.m. local time, the demand suddenly\n_fell_ sharply. What I hadn’t realized, from my desk on the other side of the\ncountry, was that an emergency text message had gone out to Californians,\nasking them to take action: to turn off anything nonessential and to turn down\ntheir air-conditioning. And they did. Within minutes, demand had dropped by\nthe equivalent of nearly a million homes’ worth of electricity and the crisis\nwas averted.\n\n## The Human Systems behind the Networks\n\nEnergy, networks, standards, scale, time: these are the building blocks of\ninfrastructural systems, as systems. Not just each individual type of system,\nor the elements of it that we can see and interact with, the power outlets and\nhighway overpasses and bridges and cellphone towers. Rather, we now have a\nconception of how these systems are complex technologies in their own right,\nrooted in specific features of the material and technological world, that they\nare part of global networks resulting from global cooperation, that they use\nenergy to move resources to where our bodies are, and that they are dynamic\nand interconnected.\n\nThe systemic sublime is about more than just technology—or rather, technology\nis more than just the physical systems. These are human systems, created by\nand for humans to serve particular needs and desires, and to meet them in\nparticular ways. They are intrinsically collective systems, which call for the\nultrastructure of collective decision-making; this includes governance and\nregulation, agreements and policies and treaties. Why do our systems of\ninfrastructural provision function the way they do? Why were they built out\nthe way they were? Economic imperatives, political structures, and social\nnorms all had a part in shaping them.\n\n\n# Five\n\n# The Social Context of Infrastructure\n\nI have a deep affection for a lot— _a lot—_ of charismatic infrastructural\nmegastructures. When I transit through Chicago O’Hare or London’s Heathrow\nAirport, it feels like I’m in the beating heart of the world, at the nexus of\nworldwide systems and thousands and thousands of human stories. I still feel\nwarmly toward the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station where I spent so much\ntime at as a child. The combination of the vast scale and ornate detailing of\nthe Hoover Dam, set amidst its arid, austere desert surroundings, is brain-\nmelting. I adore the appealingly calm quiet of the paired hydroelectric power\nplants set inside green and forested Niagara Gorge, several miles downstream\nof the thunderous falling water and throngs of tourists at Niagara Falls. But\nif I did have to name a favorite, one infrastructural installation does stand\nout. It’s simultaneously enormous and almost entirely hidden, an elegant\nengineering project that serves what at first seems to be an almost whimsical\nhuman purpose.\n\nSnowdonia National Park, in north Wales, is idyllic, all green hills\nsurrounding blue glacial lakes. Long-standing farmhouses, ruined castles, and\nmodern buildings alike show off the gorgeous locally quarried slate, the\nmining of which grew into an important industry in the nineteenth century (the\nregion recently became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of the historic\nmining facilities). A Victorian-era railway carries tourists to the top of\nMount Snowdon to take in the view. If you’re lucky enough to be there in May,\nlike I was, the charm of the landscape is further enhanced by absolutely\nadorable gamboling baby lambs _everywhere_. But I was there to see something\nthat had been made deliberately, carefully, and beautifully invisible,\nconcealed inside a giant cavern carved out of a mountain. Like a supervillain\nin their lair, it gathers power to itself, usually under cover of darkness.\nIt’s just that the power, in this case, mostly lets people watch TV and make\ntea.\n\nSnowdonia is the home of Dinorwig Power Station, popularly known as Electric\nMountain. Together with some friends who live in Northern England, I had made\nmy way to the visitor center next to the train station to join a guided tour.\nIt began with an introductory video describing the facility, filled with\nclaims about its size: “the largest cavern in Europe!” “two Empire State\nBuildings high!” and “three Blackpool Towers high!” (Without the implied\nconversion factor, that last comparison would have been opaque, but my accent\nfrom the other side of the North Atlantic made it clear that I was an\noutlier.) We were all made to stow our phones and cameras in lockers before\nboarding a minibus that trundled through the Welsh countryside for a few\nminutes, passed through several security gates, and then went down a tunnel\ndeep into the mountain itself, Elidir Fawr.\n\nConventional electrical grids largely operate with just-in-time energy\nproduction, where the exact demand is estimated on a minute-by-minute basis,\nand electricity is generated and allocated accordingly. The whole system is\ncontinuously and carefully monitored because failing to match the demand with\nadequate supply leads to brownouts or even blackouts. Most of the demand is\npredictable. There’s a daily cycle of electricity usage, commonly known as the\n“duck curve,” tracing the profile of a duck’s back and neck over the course of\nthe day. The duck’s tail is the low morning peak, as people wake up and start\ntheir day, the steady demand through to the late afternoon traces its back,\nand then a sharp rise in demand corresponds to the back of the duck’s neck,\npeaking at the top of its head in the evening, as everyone turns on lights,\nmakes dinner, does chores, or has the TV on. Finally, there’s an overnight low\nin aggregate demand while most people are sleeping. The exact pattern and\namount of electricity usage on a given day can be affected by other factors,\nlike holidays and the weather. For unusually high loads, electricity is often\nsupplied from “peaker plants,” designed to be brought online as needed and\nwhich run on fossil fuels, usually natural gas. While expensive to operate,\nthe electricity they produce commands a premium price because of the high\ndemand. A typical use case for peaker plants here in the northeast U.S. is\nduring hot summer afternoons on workdays, when air conditioners are running\nfull tilt. Electric Mountain is a kind of peaker plant, but part of what makes\nit special is that it can go from idle to producing power in minutes, or in as\nlittle as _fifteen seconds_ from standby mode.\n\nConstruction at Dinorwig started in 1974 and the facility came online ten\nyears later. In the control room, operators ensure an adequate supply of\nelectricity in the grid by carefully monitoring their inputs, ready to act\nwhen needed. One of those inputs is watching television. Electric Mountain was\nconceived and designed in the late 1960s, and that period through the 1990s\nwas the heyday of synchronous, broadcast television, where nearly everyone in\nthe UK might be watching the same TV series finale or sporting event at the\nsame time. And then, when the show was over, a substantial fraction of the\nviewing populace did the same thing, in a phenomenon known as “TV pickup”:\nthey reliably and immediately plugged in a power-hungry electric kettle to\nmake tea. Alert operators could open a set of valves the instant the\ntelevision broadcast ended, sending a spike of power into the grid in less\nthan the time it took for viewers to get up from the sofa, stretch, and walk\ninto the kitchen.\n\nThis rapid response is possible because Electric Mountain is a pumped-storage\nhydroelectric station. From the outside, the installation consists of Elidir\nFawr and two placid, slate-bottomed lakes: Marchlyn Mawr, high on the flank of\nthe mountain, and Llyn Peris, nestled in the valley between Elidir Fawr and\nMount Snowdon near the visitor center. Inside the mountain, they’re connected\nby a vertical shaft. The half a kilometer or so of altitude between the two\nlakes allows them to serve as upper and lower reservoirs. When an operator\nopens the valves at the top, water from Marchlyn Mawr flows in and falls\nstraight down onto the turbines of six generators lined up in “the concert\nhall,” the cavern in the mountain that’s big enough to comfortably house St.\nPaul’s Cathedral, and then out to Llyn Peris. At full flow, enough water to\nfill a twenty-five-meter swimming pool passes through the turbines every\nsecond (appropriately enough, the tour guide described this as “1.5 million\ncups of tea”) but even at this rate, the artificial waterfall inside the\nmountain can generate electricity continuously for six hours before Marchlyn\nMawr is depleted.\n\nAll of this is impressive enough—by being able to produce this power at a\nmoment’s notice, Dinorwig dramatically increases the reliability of the UK\nelectrical grid. But the real elegance, to my mind, is what happens next. When\ndemand is low, there’s surplus capacity available because of baseload power\ngenerators, like nuclear plants, that supply a near-constant amount of\nelectricity. After all those television-watching Brits go to bed, the\ngenerators are run _backward_. Instead of the falling water spinning the\nturbines to generate electricity, power is fed _into_ the generators, causing\nthe blades to rotate. Now it’s an electrical motor, and the turbine works as a\npump, lifting water from the valley all the way back up the shaft to the\nhigher reservoir and so resetting the system. It isn’t perfectly\nefficient—that would violate one of the laws of thermodynamics, which mandates\nthat something has to be lost in the process—but it’s pretty good, with about\n75 percent of the energy available for reuse. Electric Mountain makes\nengineering sense as a way to deal with unpredictable spikes in demand, but it\nalso makes economic sense because it can time-shift energy usage from\nexpensive high-demand times to cheaper low-demand periods, arbitraging the\nprice difference. What’s more, power from pumped-storage hydro has a much\nlower carbon footprint than conventional peaker plants.\n\nDinorwig sets my engineering heart aflutter not just for its scale, although\nsize does indeed matter, but because of its undeniable elegance, the way it\nsolves a problem by using the available resources—mountain lakes! low\novernight demand!—cleverly and parsimoniously. And I admit that I do find the\nidea of a power station that was built, even in part, so that an _entire\ncountry_ could turn off the telly and all go make themselves a nice cuppa to\nbe kind of hilarious. Since the advent of first video recording and then\nstreaming, television viewing has become much less coordinated, and so TV\npickup is now much less pronounced. But Dinorwig is becoming more useful and\nvaluable, not less. As renewable electricity generation increases, the\ninherent variability of sources like solar and wind means that more grid-scale\nenergy storage is necessary in order to make sure that there’s always\nelectricity available to meet demand. A pumped-storage hydroelectric power\nstation like Dinorwig is effectively a giant rechargeable battery.\n\nBut impressive though Electric Mountain is as an engineering accomplishment,\nthat’s not what I think is the most astonishing thing about it. It cost nearly\nhalf a billion pounds to excavate the inside of Elidir Fawr and construct the\nfacility, making it the largest civil engineering contract ever awarded by the\nUK government at the time, and it required all the cooperation around\ntechnical expertise and standards that we discussed in the last chapter. But\nin a larger sense, what really makes Dinorwig and similar megafacilities\nremarkable is the level of social, political, and economic organization that\nunderpins the decision to build them at all.\n\nTen thousand years ago, give or take, _Homo sapiens_ began to produce food via\nagriculture, which led to permanent settlements. About five thousand years\nago, the urban revolution began. Many people living in proximity to each other\nmade more complex forms of social organization possible, and the rise and\nspread of cities led to the generation of surplus beyond mere subsistence,\nwhich in turn enabled new modes of human activity. Then, from about five\nhundred years ago, humans suddenly began to get a lot richer. How suddenly?\nEconomic historians have quantified it by estimating the per capita gross\ndomestic product in constant dollars. It’s basically a flat line for fifty\nthousand years and then, starting in Europe around 1600, it starts to rise,\ngetting steeper and steeper. Economist Deirdre McCloskey gave it a name: the\nGreat Enrichment.\n\nThe _what_ of the Great Enrichment can be stated simply: humans started to get\nmuch, much better at cooperating in ways that led to the creation of economic\nsurplus. People learned and were incentivized to work together to produce more\nand more wealth, far beyond what we had ever been able to do as individuals,\nor neighbors, or kinship groups, and this became part of what led to systems\nof standards, networks, and technological cooperation. As we’ve seen, these\ncooperative structures have grown and grown until they span the globe. The\nGreat Enrichment is why my daily life isn’t focused on caregiving and\nsubsistence farming.\n\nThe _why_ (or rather, the _Why then?_ and _Why there?)_ of the Great\nEnrichment remains a contentious area of debate among social scientists,\neconomists, and historians. One argument is that there was something special\nabout Western Europe: some way of thinking that fostered collaboration between\npeers that was coupled with the idea that no matter where one stood in\nsociety, having more wealth was desirable and possible, with the Scientific\nRevolution and the Enlightenment as likely contributors. The growth in wealth\nis almost certainly linked to private ownership of resources, particularly the\nidea of enclosure, which was the creation and extension of property rights\nover open fields and common land which allowed for the exclusion of non-\nowners. The invention of the corporation, a way for unrelated individuals to\ncollectively invest, might also have been a factor. No matter how the Great\nEnrichment got started or where, it enabled the exponential growth of\naccumulation of capital, the reinvestment of wealth to rapidly produce more\nwealth. Just like cultures in a petri dish are often quickly dominated by\nwhichever microorganism can replicate and divide the fastest, it seems likely\nthat the first society that got traction on this process, regardless of the\ninitial impetus, would have a significant economic advantage. But there’s no\nquestion that the uneven geographic distribution of this rapid growth in\nwealth—a distribution that’s still apparent today—was extended and accelerated\nby European colonialism.\n\nEven if we can’t isolate the initial cause of this sharp increase in economic\ngrowth, we are all living in a world shaped by its effects. It’s especially\napparent at facilities like the Dinorwig Power Station, because they’re a\nmanifestation of a collective economic surplus being put to work. There’s a\nfamiliar pattern for infrastructural systems: they often require a significant\ninvestment in the form of capital costs, paid up front, before the system can\nbe used for the very first time. Think about New York City building out its\ndams, reservoirs, and aqueducts, all of which had to be in place before the\nfirst drop of water came out of a Manhattan tap.\n\nThe economic argument for building systems like Dinorwig or a municipal water\nsupply is that the large initial investment pays off: once the system is\nbuilt, it makes provision cheaper for a long time afterward. Public\ninfrastructure is often funded with bonds because the large upfront cost can\nbe balanced against their steady payout rate over time. This seems mundane,\nbut it’s actually remarkable. First, the construction of systems like these is\npredicated on the belief that there will be a stable community in place to\nbenefit from them, typically for decades to come. They’re an investment into a\nvision of a _shared_ future. They are, by their nature, about continuity and\ntime. Next, the economic argument for their value is strengthened by universal\nprovision because the capital and operating costs can be amortized over more\nusers. Finally, membership in that social collective is primarily based on\n_where_ you are, not on kinship or social class or anything else. One\ndefinition of politics is just that it’s what you get when a group of people\nhave an ongoing relationship with one another that they can’t easily walk away\nfrom, so they need to figure out ways to work together. One of the most\nprofound and sustained ways in which we are in a relationship with other\npeople is just by living near them and sharing the physical systems we use to\nmeet our needs. A focus on the engineering and technical considerations of\ninfrastructural systems can tell you that the most efficient thing to do is to\nbuild a centralized water treatment plant and a network to distribute it. But\nthis can only be achieved—planned, designed, and paid for—collectively. A\npumped-storage hydroelectric plant or a municipal water system is a physical\ninstantiation of an ongoing relationship between the people who share it.\n\nInfrastructural systems become part of the way that communities generate a\ngrowing wealth surplus through economic growth, engendered by cooperation.\nBuilding out a municipal water supply or a public power utility is a way to\nleverage economic surplus by reinvesting it into even more cooperation and\nsurplus, over the course of decades to come. This sustained, mutually\nbeneficial relationship between people who are near each other, mediated in\npart through infrastructural systems, can itself become a factor in the uneven\ngeographical distribution of wealth.\n\n## Infrastructure as Agency, Revisited\n\nWhen a pandemic shut down his college, a twenty-three-year-old student\nreturned to his family home and found productive ways to occupy his time for\nthe better part of two years. The college was Trinity, at Cambridge\nUniversity, the student was Isaac Newton, and the independent research in\noptics, gravitation, and calculus that he carried out at Woolsthorpe Manor\nduring the enforced leave from his coursework would result in 1666 being known\nas his “year of wonders.”\n\nThe residential engineering college where I teach was similarly shut down in\n2020, as we sent our students off to their own homes to help keep them safe\nduring the height of the global coronavirus pandemic (although their\ncoursework continued, in modified form, thanks to modern telecommunications).\nWorking at home in another Cambridge, four centuries and three thousand miles\nremoved from Newton’s, I remember hearing about his _annus mirabilis_ during\nthe Black Death, occasionally presented as an “inspiring” example of being\nproductive during a global health crisis. It’s rarely mentioned in the popular\naccounts of his year, but young Isaac Newton had a cohort of servants in his\nhome to keep him warm and fed and who made sure there were tapers or lamps for\nhim to see his experiments and equations by. It occurred to me that most of\nthese day-to-day needs were also met for me, not by a household staff but by\ninfrastructural utilities.\n\nI did not, of course, revolutionize our understanding of physics from my home\nduring the pandemic because I’m not an Isaac Newton, and I probably don’t know\none personally. But on a planet of eight billion people, there are Newtons out\nthere, and Beethovens, and Cervanteses, and da Vincis. Most of them haven’t\nbeen able to live up to that potential. And while I name-check Newton and\nBeethoven and Cervantes and da Vinci, they all surely had female peers who\nnever had the opportunity to go to Cambridge, much less spend their time\ndrawing, carrying out experiments, or composing music. By and large, those\nwomen would have been kept busy making sure the needs of the people around\nthem were met, whether it was what they wanted to do or not. That remains just\nas true today for the large fraction of the world that doesn’t have secure\nfood, water, sanitation, or housing. It’s often framed as humanity “losing” a\npotentially brilliant scientist or composer, but it’s about _everyone_ having\nmore agency in their own lives, and the possibility to develop their\nindividual potential. In his book _Development as Freedom_ , the Nobel\nPrize–winning economist Amartya Sen wrote that we “generally have excellent\nreasons for wanting more income or wealth. This is not because income and\nwealth are desirable for their own sake, but because, typically, they are\nadmirable general-purpose means for having more freedom to lead the kind of\nlives we have reason to value. The usefulness of wealth lies in the things\nthat it allows us to do—the substantive freedoms it helps us to achieve.”\n\nIf, as Jean-Paul Sartre wrote, “Hunger is precisely in itself the demand to be\nsomething other than a belly,” then the most basic freedoms result from having\nyour bodily needs met: to not remain hungry, or thirsty, or too hot or too\ncold or too fatigued or too sleepy, and not to be sick or in pain. Sen’s\nresearch on the world’s poorest people considered how they might get those\nbasic needs met: freedom _from_ having those needs. But as more resources\nbecome available, that opens up freedoms as a space of possibility, the\nfreedom _to_ lead the lives we value. Artificial light provides a good\nexample. Being able to function after the sun goes down or in an enclosed\nspace is an immediate extension to one’s personal agency. If money is a\ngeneral-purpose tool to achieve freedom, then using it to buy more lumen-hours\nof light is among the most direct paths there.\n\nThis is the role that infrastructural systems play in my own life, and how\nthey provide me with agency—they are a means of freeing up my time, energy,\nand attention. I could probably marshal the skills and resources to build out\na home that mostly stands apart from at least some of these systems—off the\ngrid, with its own water supply, a septic system, solar panels, maybe a high-\nefficiency stove. But then I’d have to operate and maintain these systems, and\nthat means that I would have notably _less_ freedom in my life, not more—in a\nvery real way, it’d just be a higher-tech version of what my female ancestors\nhad to do every day. I also know enough about the systems that serve my home,\nand the specialized skills of the people who keep them running, to know that\nnothing I could do myself would ever result in anywhere near the level of\nquality and reliability that allows me to mostly not think about them. On a\nday-to-day basis, my personal agency doesn’t come from money _per se—_ it\nmostly comes from living in a place that’s served by high-quality\ninfrastructural systems. But the bigger point is that access to energy and\nresources through shared infrastructural systems frees up not just my own life\nbut those of everyone around me. The real difference between me and Isaac\nNewton isn’t our own lives, which in some ways are actually remarkably\nsimilar. It’s the difference between our lives and those of the other people\nin his home, a class of subservient humans, economically or even forcibly\ncoerced to household labor. Were I in Woolsthorpe in 1666, my gender would\nalmost certainly have put me in with the servants, not with the scholars.\n\nIf you’re privileged enough that you normally have access to this full-stack\ninfrastructure, you’re likely accustomed to these systems only ever increasing\nyour agency. From the perspective of the richest people on the planet—of whom\nI certainly am one, as part of the global 10 percent—the relationship between\ninfrastructural systems and freedom always becomes most clear when something\nfails: the power goes out, a water main breaks, a global pandemic means we\ndon’t travel or even commute. Our baseline shifts and our lives are suddenly\nmuch more constrained because our attention and efforts are necessarily\nfocused on how to see when it’s dark, how to stay warm, what we’ll drink, how\nwe’ll dispose of our waste, how we’ll cook our food, or how we’ll stay\nconnected to others.\n\n## Market Goods and Network Monopolies\n\nNear the beginning of _Mad Max: Fury Road_ (one of my all-time favorite\nmovies), the warlord Immortan Joe, whose citadel is built on top of an\nunderground spring in the postapocalyptic Australian desert, opens a valve and\nwater gushes out onto a desperately thirsty crowd below. “Do not, my friends,”\nhe roars over a loudspeaker, “become addicted to water. It will take hold of\nyou and you will resent its absence.”\n\nWater, sewage, electricity, mobility, communications—infrastructural networks\nprovide resources that don’t behave like consumer products or services. They\naren’t market goods that you can elect to purchase or not, now or later, from\nyour choice of sellers. Buying a car is different from having access to a\nhighway. Having electricity service is not like getting a haircut.\n\nFor a start, infrastructural systems are often used to provide survival needs.\nThere’s a reason why control over access to water, whether physical or\neconomic, is a staple of dystopian science fiction. Water isn’t a consumer\ngood, and potable water for drinking, as well as for sanitation and hygiene,\nis simply not subject to the usual laws of supply and demand. You can’t choose\nnot to drink water if it’s too expensive. You can’t even put it off in the\nhope that the price will drop a week or a month from now. In the depths of a\nNew England winter, the means to heat one’s home is a necessity, not a choice.\nEven though it’s not directly required for survival in the way that water and\nheat are, we use electricity—raw, versatile energy delivered directly to where\nwe need it—to provide for a wide range of needs. It’s part of why blackouts\nare so dangerous: lives are lost as a direct result of power outages in homes,\nsuch as when people have medical conditions that require the use of at-home\nrespiratory assistance. A power failure during a winter ice storm or one that\nknocks out air conditioners during a heat wave can exacerbate medical issues.\nThese indirect effects can be revealed by excess-death analyses, in which the\ndeaths during and immediately after a power failure are compared to a baseline\nrate. Some of the lethal risks of blackouts result from attempts to cope with\nthe lack of grid power—in recent years, more people in the U.S. have died of\ncarbon monoxide poisoning from emergency generators in the aftermath of major\nhurricanes than from the storm surges and flooding themselves.\n\nEven if the services provided by infrastructure networks aren’t survival\nneeds, they can still be nondiscretionary and non-fungible—it’s difficult or\nimpossible to substitute something else. Communications is a good example:\nit’s not going to do me any good to send you a fax over a phone line if you’re\nexpecting me to fill out an online form. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nshift to online education meant that reliable access to the Internet suddenly\nbecame a nonnegotiable requirement for classwork. If you need a car to get\naround your neighborhood, you can’t choose to fill up the gas tank of your car\nnext week if it’s empty today. If you commute by public transit, you can’t\n“buy less” of a subway fare if the price goes up. Because our use of shared\ninfrastructural networks is rarely at our individual discretion, the usual\neconomic rules of supply and demand mostly go out the window.\n\nWe also usually don’t have much choice in _which_ infrastructural systems we\nuse. This might be because of limited access, as exploited by Immortan Joe,\nwhose citadel was the only source of water for the people living nearby.\nUsually, however, it’s because of the way that networks function. Their\nefficiency comes with some drawbacks.\n\nIt’s a cliché in the U.S. that everyone hates their local cable company, which\nis now often their Internet provider. In many cases, there’s only one provider\nin a given region, because that sort of “natural monopoly” is a consequence of\nthe way that networks work. They’re often cost-effective because, while they\nmight have a large upfront cost to build out, the cost to add nodes is\nrelatively low. But building out a new network doesn’t make economic sense\nunless the provider can recruit enough customers to pay for their service. The\nproblem is that a second network in the same area, much less a third or a\nfourth, might cost nearly as much to build out as the first but it could, at\nmost, only get a fraction of the total paying customers. The network provider\nhas a significant first-mover advantage—as they build out their user base,\nthey are also creating a barrier to entry for new competitors. The usual end\nresult of this is just a single provider of the service in a given area: a\nmonopoly that arises “naturally” from the characteristics of networks,\nespecially physical ones. That means that one of the most commonly extolled\nvirtues of a free market—that companies compete with each other to offer the\nmost appealing service at the most reasonable price—isn’t in effect.\n\nPrivate companies that have a monopoly on a necessary service behave in pretty\nmuch the way that you’d expect they would. In the best-case scenario, customer\nservice is terrible, which leads to endless griping and jokes about avoiding\ninteracting with cable companies at all costs. But what’s worse, investor-\nowned providers can decide to increase their profit by raising prices or\ndowngrading service, secure in the knowledge that their customers can neither\nchoose a different provider nor do without—the classic reason why monopolies\nare considered to be at odds with the best interests of consumers. One\nresponse to this is oversight: utilities, whether private or public, tend to\nbe heavily and carefully regulated at all levels. Where I live, for example,\nprivate companies that provide natural gas for home heating are forbidden from\nshutting off service to any household, for any reason, in the wintertime. But\nthis also means that consumers are at the mercy of those regulations and\nwhether they have teeth. Oversight and enforcement vary widely with the local\nregulatory environment because there’s always a tension between private\nproviders and regulators.\n\nA major strategy for avoiding the moral hazards of network monopolies in\nprivate hands has been for them to be publicly owned or nonprofits from the\nstart, like the electrical and Internet cooperatives that are common in rural\nareas of the U.S., or else to consolidate private networks and make them\npublic. For example, my hometown of Toronto has one of the world’s oldest\nmunicipal power utilities, Toronto Hydro, originally the Toronto Hydro-\nElectric System. By 1921, all of the various power companies that had sprung\nup to deliver electricity to the city from the generating stations at Niagara\nFalls had been purchased by the city and consolidated into a single larger\nnetwork. It was more efficient and allowed for coordinated decision-making,\nand the incentive to profit from the network monopoly was replaced with a\nmandate to provide the service at the lowest cost to the users.\n\n## Collective Infrastructural Systems and Public Goods\n\nIf the resources delivered by infrastructural networks, like water or energy,\naren’t governed by the logic of the marketplace, neither are the networks\nthemselves. Buying a car and “buying” the roads to drive on are completely\ndifferent concepts because the economics of collective systems are\nfundamentally different from individually purchased consumer goods.\n\nMy car is a private good. The title is in my name—it belongs to me—and since I\nown it and use it, it’s not available for others to use. Even when it’s parked\non a public street, I can keep other people from using it by locking the doors\nand taking the key with me. Physical objects lend themselves to being private\ngoods, because atoms exist in discrete assemblages in time and space. Most of\nour personal belongings are private goods.\n\nThe roads that I drive on, on the other hand, are a public good. To an\neconomist, that has a very specific and distinct meaning: in contrast to a\nprivate good, a public good is nonrivalrous and nonexcludable. “Nonrivalrous”\nmeans that one person having access to or enjoying a good does not preclude\nother people from doing the same. “Nonexcludable” means that people can’t be\nprevented from using and benefiting from it. Public goods tend to be\nintangible. Even though the roads themselves are physical, what really matters\nis access to and use of it as a network, not the strip of asphalt itself. I\ncan enjoy sitting in the Boston Common (established in 1634) on a warm summer\nday, and so can many other people. The city park is open to the sidewalk and\nthe street on every side. Fences and gates around private parks are a way of\nphysically enforcing exclusion, or at least signifying that they are\nexcludable spaces.\n\nPrivate goods have an obvious business model: make the thing, sell the thing.\nThere’s generally much less incentive for the private sector to produce\nnonexcludable goods, because if you can’t prevent people from receiving a\nbenefit and they no longer have a reason to pay for it, they presumably\nwon’t—the “free rider” problem. Too many free riders and too few paying\ncustomers means that the provider won’t be able to make a profit if their\nbusiness model is based on selling access to that benefit. With apologies to\nall my friends who work in digital media for the way I’m about to simplify a\ncomplex transition, I’m going to use journalism to illustrate.\n\nFor most of its existence, print journalism was able to limit the fraction of\nfree riders and to fund reporting by selling a good that was _both_ rivalrous\nand excludable, like a newspaper. I picture those scenes in old movies of a\ntrain full of businessmen on their morning commute, each reading his own copy\nof the morning paper. Because the articles and the information they contained\nwere only available in print, the business model included selling the physical\nnewspapers. The revenue from the purchase price (as well as from advertising)\npaid for the production and distribution of the papers themselves and for the\njournalism that filled their pages.\n\nIntangibles, however, don’t lend themselves to being private goods in the same\nway. Broadcast radio and television function almost exactly like streetlights:\nonce those electromagnetic waves are released into the world, anyone in the\nservice area who has a receiver can listen or watch. No one is excluded, and\nany number of people can listen, so it fits the economist’s definition of a\npublic good. That means that commercial broadcasters have always needed a\nbusiness model for their news reporting that didn’t depend on consumers paying\nfor access, and it’s typically been on-air advertising.\n\nDigital communications upended media in part because of this shift from\nphysical goods to intangible services. Any number of people can read the\nonline version of an article simultaneously, but newspapers can still make\ntheir journalism excludable by putting it behind an online paywall. A\nsubscription to the online version of _The New York Times_ is what economists\ncall a “club good”—it’s excludable but nonrivalrous because, while only\nsubscribers have access to the articles, anyone with access can read articles\nwithout diminishing the experience of others in any way. Online advertising is\nthe analog to on-air commercials for broadcast and it remains, in all its\nincreasingly creepy and intrusive forms, the default business model for “free”\ncontent on the Internet.\n\nBut noncommercial and publicly funded media, whether broadcast or online, turn\nthe free rider problem on its head. If you believe that journalism and other\nprogramming have a value to their consumers and society at large that isn’t\nabout being as profitable as possible, then more people reading, listening, or\nwatching is a free rider _win_ , not a free rider problem. It means that, for\na fixed investment of resources, more people can benefit. This is the logic\nthat lies behind the public funding of radio and television all over the\nworld, including systems like the British Broadcasting Corporation and the\nCanadian and Australian counterparts that it inspired.\n\nThis also gets us to why the economic definition and the everyday definition\nof “public good” are frequently confused or conflated. To an economist, the\n“good” in “public good” is in the sense of “goods and services,” physical\nitems that satisfy human needs or desires. Nonrivalrous and nonexcludable\npublic goods often have large upfront costs but low or minimal incremental\ncosts. For example, radio broadcasting requires the resources to build out a\nstation and transmitter, and the funding to do reporting, produce programs,\nrun a studio, and so forth. But once you’ve done all of this, it doesn’t cost\nanything to have more listeners—they just need to turn on their radio (or,\nthese days, to tune in online). But the flip side of this is that having more\nconsumers isn’t directly linked to more income or to reduced costs. For\nsomething to be a public good in the economics sense, therefore, there\ngenerally needs to be some impetus for making it available that goes beyond\nthe profit motive. In the everyday sense of “public good,” “good” suggests the\nopposite of harm, because in practice, public goods (in the economic sense)\nmostly provide broad, social benefits—that’s why they exist at all.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound familiar, it’s because it’s also how many\ninfrastructural systems behave. A network of roads is largely nonrivalrous—my\ntaking the highway to work doesn’t preclude other people from doing the\nsame—and they are relatively nonexcludable. A municipal water system takes a\nlot of resources to get up and running—to deliver that first glassful of\npotable water—but once it’s up, the incremental cost of delivering more water\nor adding households is quite small. A well-designed municipal system with\nsufficient capacity can be effectively nonrivalrous, where everyone gets the\nwater they need.\n\nEconomic models aren’t reality, of course, and there are few systems that are\n“pure” public goods. Roads and water supplies are rarely perfectly\nnonrivalrous. Traffic congestion slows travel on roads. In much of the world,\ndrought can and often does limit the amount of available water, for household\nuse and for agriculture. Parks get crowded. Few of these systems are also\nperfectly nonexcludable. A radio or a television broadcast still requires\naccess to a radio or a TV. As individuals, our primary interface to\ninfrastructural systems—electricity for artificial light, water for drinking\nand hygiene, fuel for cooking, and telecommunications—is where we live.\nWithout a home, as in the significant unhoused communities in many major\nAmerican cities, the ability to use and benefit from these infrastructure\nsystems is limited or compromised. But the most common way of making\ninfrastructural provision into an excludable good or service is simply through\ncharging for its use—a water, electricity, heating, or telephone bill.\n\nServices that do meet the strict economics definition of a public good often\ndon’t make business sense if the provider’s primary motive is maximizing\nprofit for its investors. But in many cases, it makes sense to build and\nmaintain a system because it’s in the best economic interest of its _users._\nIt can be financially worthwhile for them even (or especially) if there isn’t\na profit. This is how retail cooperatives work, for example—they increase the\npurchasing power of their members. It’s not an accident that most of the\nsystems that we consider to be infrastructure behave this way, because users\nbenefit _individually_ as a result of acting collectively with others. For\nexample, about 85 percent of U.S. households have access to a public water\nsupply and sewage treatment. (Because they’re concentrated in cities, just 8\npercent of water systems serve about 70 percent of the U.S. population.) The\nremaining households, which typically rely on wells for drinking water and\nseptic systems for waste, almost always do so because there is no public\nsystem available to them, not because the private systems are considered to be\na superior alternative. Network effects mean that universal provision has the\npotential to be both cheaper and better for _each_ of its users; the fact that\neveryone has access to it is almost a side effect. This also helps explain why\nthe provision of other basic human needs, like food and housing, isn’t\nconsidered to be infrastructure: if your neighbors aren’t adequately housed,\nit doesn’t negatively affect your household in the same way as it does if they\ndon’t have adequate sanitation. And unlike your electricity or\ntelecommunications provision, your groceries generally don’t get cheaper if\nyour neighbors eat too. Even though food and housing security for all is a\npublic good, it’s “only” in the sense of having social value, not in the\neconomic sense. I found this to be something of a grim realization because of\nhow far it went toward explaining how Americans can take universal water\nprovision, electricity, and roads mostly for granted while ensuring that\neveryone in their community is fed and housed remains an ongoing political and\nsocial challenge.\n\nCompared to the familiar physical objects of our world, then, which are\nrivalrous and excludable by default, networks and systems can behave in\nunusual or even counterintuitive ways. That makes calculating their cost,\nbenefit, and value less straightforward, not least because they can enable\nother kinds of benefits that are less easily captured on a balance sheet.\nThese systems are often public, because building and maintaining them is\ndefinitionally in the public interest. Public control and operation allow for\nexpanded access and unified networks while sidestepping the risks to consumers\nof network monopolies in private hands. Electricity, water, and transportation\nsystems worldwide all followed this pattern as well, merging fragmented\nprivate networks into unified public systems. This includes public transit in\ncities such as Boston, New York, and London—it made a lot more sense that the\nUnderground map is a tangled mess once I learned that a patchwork of private\ncompanies was providing subway services, largely as a way to avoid the\ncongested surface roads, before they were brought under public ownership and\nconsolidated into the Transport for London network.\n\nIf infrastructural systems substantially reduce the cost of provision for\nusers, and they behave very much like public goods in the strict economic\nsense, and they provide basic necessities or survival needs, then it becomes\nclear why the term “public good” is confusing. Provision of these services is\na public good in the _moral_ sense, as in the opposite of evil. The imperative\nto offer aid to others, including strangers—to provide food, water, and\nshelter—is part of religions and cultures the world over. Especially when\ninfrastructural systems provide for survival needs, like water or heat, their\nprovision intersects with these social values. That moral element is thrown\ninto especially sharp relief when services are shut off, because usually the\npresence of a network means that the resources it provides will be available\nin any case. Not allowing access because someone is unable to pay their bills\nis then actively _withholding_ basic human necessities, rather than neglect or\nlack of capacity. It’s why denying water to those who needed it was a way of\nconveying, in just a few moments of screen time, that Immortan Joe was\nmonstrous.\n\nBeyond the shared and moral benefits of access, infrastructural systems offer\nbenefits that are so integral to the way we live our lives that they are hard\nto even value. In economics terms, these are externalities—benefits (or costs)\nthat are not fully accounted for in the pricing of a transaction.\n\n## Infrastructure as Externalities\n\nThe best honey I’ve ever tasted comes from my friend John Pittman’s bees,\nwhich live in hives in the backyard of his home in New Hampshire. On a sunny\nsummer afternoon, they leave and return to the hive in a steady stream, a\nsoftly buzzing flight path that reminds me of how closely spaced planes take\noff and land at busy airports during peak times. The honeybees collect nectar\nfrom the wildflowers and fruit trees that grow on neighboring yards, bring it\nback to their hive, and turn it into extravagantly floral-scented golden\nsweetness. From a strictly economic point of view, his neighbors could argue\nthat John is getting positive benefits from their properties without paying\nfor the privilege of accessing them. Of course, it’s also possible that\nthey’re the ones who benefit from the bees, which pollinate flowers as they\ncollect nectar. Most honeybees in the U.S., in fact, get driven on trucks\nacross the country to fields and orchards, following the seasonal blossoms, on\na “pay for pollination” basis. John’s neighbors may be making a fruitful\n(ahem) exchange which they are simply unaware of.\n\nExternalities, to economists, are values or costs that aren’t accounted for by\nthe market, because they accrue to someone who isn’t part of the transaction\nand therefore often has no choice in whether it happens or not. If a company\npollutes the watershed where a facility is located, but doesn’t pay to either\nremediate the water source or to cover the costs associated with the impacts\non local residents, it’s a _negative_ externality that affects people other\nthan the customers who paid the company. From secondhand smoke to “forever”\nchemicals, this particular externality is ubiquitous and is the major driver\nfor environmental regulation, which typically accounts for the costs by\nrequiring companies either to mitigate the impact (like installing scrubbers\nto remove the acid rain-causing sulfur oxides from coal-burning power plants)\nor to remediate the effects. The costs for these interventions then show up on\nbalance sheets and profit forecasts.\n\nConversely, a positive externality is when good things happen to people who\nhaven’t paid for them directly, like when John’s honeybees collect nectar from\nhis neighbor’s land. In much the same way that Schrödinger’s cat is both alive\nand dead until someone looks in the box and observes which, the cost of\nsomething only becomes real the moment a buyer trades money for it. Positive\nexternalities are hard to value in dollar terms _because_ they’re not paid\nfor.\n\nWhen we try to determine the economic value of collective systems that are so\nimportant and ubiquitous that we build other systems on top of them, the\ndollar estimates can quickly become astronomically high, almost impossible to\nconceptualize. The 2021 budget of the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) was\nabout $1.2 billion dollars. The commercial weather business in the country,\nmost of which is built on the data provided by the NWS, is a _seven_ billion\ndollar industry, and the direct economic benefit of weather forecasting is\nestimated at $13 billion. Location services are an even more striking example.\nIt costs the U.S. government about a billion dollars a year to maintain GPS\nsatellites and systems. In 2016, Greg Milner estimated the direct value of the\nglobal GPS market to be around $30 billion, having tripled from five years\nearlier. But when Milner asked for an estimate of the dollar value of the\n_entire_ GPS market—the chips that are in receivers, the products and services\nbuilt on top of it—an industry expert declined to answer, saying only that it\nwas in the trillions, “meaningless for anyone but a scholar.” As a scholar, I\ncan say it _does_ carry meaning for me, not as data but as a signal, a\nflashing yellow light—if the dollar estimates seem laughably, incomprehensibly\nhigh, it means that using money as a metric is, if not precisely _wrong_ , at\nleast desperately incomplete. Weather forecasting or satellite mapping, as\nservices that cost a lot to provide but which then have very low incremental\ncosts to access and use, are close to being true public goods even in the pure\neconomic sense, since they’re nearly nonrivalrous. The more they’re used, the\nmore valuable they are, in ways that go far beyond the economic value of the\nindustries built on this data. Like the industry expert, I agree that the true\nvalue of these systems is literally incalculable, but it’s because they enable\nsystems and behaviors that wouldn’t be possible without them, and they help us\nto protect the irreplaceable. Collective infrastructural systems, especially\npublic utilities, are giant masses of positive externalities. Location\nservices help us navigate with confidence no matter where we are or what\ntransportation mode we’re using, to meet up with family and friends, to track\nobjects from a teddy bear to a freight train, and to go on adventures. Weather\nforecasting helps us decide if we want to go for a walk or if we need to\nevacuate a major city. And these aren’t even the critical utilities, like\nclean water, electricity, or transportation. How could you even begin to put a\ndollar value on the benefits that access to electricity brings to our lives?\n\n## Infrastructure as Economic Driver, and More\n\nIt’s a staple of news reporting around major sporting events like the Olympics\nor the World Cup—a spate of articles about the “lost productivity” that\nresults from people watching or discussing sports during their working hours.\nIt’s a familiar example of how we’ve gotten accustomed to putting everything\nin dollar terms. While economic analysis is undeniably useful, it’s also\nwoefully inadequate, especially when we’re talking about infrastructural\nsystems. In the same way that most calculations of lost productivity due to\nsports fail to account for any positive effects, even ones that might directly\nbenefit the employer, like employee cohesion and morale, any discussion of\nmonetary costs and benefits only captures a small part of the value of what\ninfrastructure is for.\n\nThe value of infrastructure is often framed as a form of cooperation that\nunderpins the economy. Infrastructural systems make it possible for\nindividuals to participate in the workforce and to be economic actors,\ncontributing to the economy and creating wealth. The universal provision of\nservices and facilities (like electricity or roads) means that they are both\nbetter and cheaper than what individuals or smaller groups could provide for\nthemselves, and the time and labor that’s freed up can be used in support of\nindustry. This kind of argument was made to taxpaying residents of 1890s\nBoston: by funding municipal improvements like water mains, sewage treatment,\nand graded roads, more people could be gainfully employed, to the benefit of\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Because much of the survival labor they\nreplace (like obtaining clean water or fuel for cooking) is highly gendered,\nthe role of these systems in underpinning agency, including economic agency,\ncan be especially profound for women. I think it’s probably not a coincidence\nthat the women’s suffrage movements in the UK, U.S., and Canada all grew\nalongside water, sewage, utility gas, and electrical systems in the late 1800s\nand early 1900s, a distribution of power in more ways than one.\n\nFreeing up the labor of workers is only the most basic economic utility of\ninfrastructure. Private companies also benefit directly from infrastructural\nsystems, and this has long been the primary economic argument for public\ninvestment—that it underpins economic development and growth. Corporations\ntake advantage of transportation systems and shipping to move goods around,\nalong with postal mail and telephony and its successors to coordinate their\nbusinesses. They can sell washing machines because water and electricity are\nutilities, and cars because there are public roads to drive them on. Companies\nsell computers (and tablets, and phones, and online advertising) because\ncommunities enjoy widespread Internet access. Infrastructural systems, public\nor not, also take advantage of public resources, from hydroelectric dams built\non rivers to the limited electromagnetic spectrum that’s parceled out for\ntelecommunications providers. How do we figure out the benefit to corporations\nof the existence of infrastructural systems? How do we figure out the value to\na company like Amazon, and by extension its shareholders, of not just the\nUnited States Postal Service last-mile delivery service that they might pay\nfor directly, but all the public roads and municipal transit for employees,\nGPS services, weather forecasting, transportation for workers—all the services\nthat are necessary for businesses to function and for customers to purchase\ntheir products? The economic benefits might be calculable—barely—for services\nlike GPS and weather forecasting, but they are almost impossible to encompass\nfor roads or electricity or even clean water.\n\nWhen a company puts something in the world that someone benefits from without\npaying for directly, it’s a “positive externality.” But when corporations and\ntheir shareholders benefit from common-pool resources, everything from the\nnatural environment to infrastructural systems built with public money, that’s\noften just considered to be the natural order of things—it’s what they’re for.\nThere almost isn’t a word for it, besides phrases like “public investment for\neconomic development.” But there’s an implicit deal here, which is that at\nleast some of the economic benefits that these systems make possible will be\nreinvested into these systems to keep them operational. Without corporate\ntaxes that adequately reflect the enormous subsidies that companies receive in\nthe form of public infrastructural systems, public investment in\ninfrastructure becomes a massive transfer of wealth from individual taxpayers\nto corporations and to their investors and shareholders. This is extractive\ncapitalism, where wealth is extracted from workers, communities, and common-\npool resources and the negative impacts and externalities are left\nunaddressed.\n\nThis matters for a lot of reasons, of course, but the one I want to focus on\nfor a moment is that economic agency is just one slice, in Amartya Sen’s\nformulation, of living the kinds of lives we have reason to value. Sen\ndescribes money as a general-purpose means of providing freedom. The\ndifference between money and collective systems like infrastructural provision\nis that while both provide agency and freedom to individuals, money does it at\nthe level of individuals, in an atomized way. Infrastructural networks, by\ntheir nature, increase individual freedoms _collectively_.\n\nIt’s been argued that the Great Enrichment invokes a virtuous circle: an\nexpansion of social rights led to more peer-to-peer cooperation between\nindividuals and hence more economic surplus, which in turn leads to more\nsocial rights. A similar argument holds for networked systems, particularly\npublic infrastructure with universal provision: any decision to build them out\nin the first place presupposes some social rights, but they also underpin the\ncontinuing development and recognition of such rights. In whichever direction\nthe causality lies, there’s a relationship between increased social, civic,\nand economic participation and the universal provision of infrastructural\nservices, which is why we associate these infrastructural systems not just\nwith economic development but also with equity and increasing enfranchisement.\nWhat that entails, precisely, changes with time and place. Sen, writing about\npeople and communities with little access to either wealth or infrastructure,\nsummed it up:\n\n> Economic growth cannot sensibly be treated as an end in itself. Development\n> has to be more concerned with enhancing the lives we lead and the freedoms\n> we enjoy. Expanding the freedoms that we have reason to value not only makes\n> our lives richer and more unfettered, but also allows us to be fuller social\n> persons, exercising our own volitions and interacting with—and\n> influencing—the world in which we live.\n\nWe can observe this expansion of freedoms over the course of the twentieth\ncentury, and into the twenty-first. Over the course of my adult life, I’ve had\nthe opportunity to observe this expansion with new infrastructural systems\nfirsthand.\n\n## The Infrastructural Pathway\n\nDuring the time I lived in the city, Shoreditch—a hip neighborhood in East\nLondon, filled with bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and tech companies—was\nhome to a venue that took its name from the letters spelled out in lightbulbs\nover the doors: electricity showroom. A few years later, I was in a cab in\nMumbai, India, heading up the Colaba Causeway, and I spotted a period building\nwhose original signage read electric house. I knew exactly what I was looking\nat and why it was there, halfway around the world.\n\nWhen electricity first began to be commercially available for domestic use, it\nwas largely as a luxury in the homes of the wealthy. A typical early setup\nwould have involved the installation of a small generator along with the\nwiring necessary to replace gas lighting with incandescent lightbulbs, which\nwere cleaner, brighter, safer, and which required less labor to operate and\nmaintain. As electricity began to be more widely available, initially from\ncoal-fired generating stations in urban areas, network effects gave local\nproviders an incentive to grow and densify their customer base. More users\nwired into their circuits lowered the per-customer cost of provision and\ncemented their network monopoly. Providers needed to persuade local households\nof the value of residential electricity, so the Electricity Showroom in\nShoreditch and the Electric House in Mumbai were built to display the wide\nvariety of novel labor-saving electrical appliances, like clothes irons and\ntoasters. They were the electricity equivalent of the storefronts of wireless\nphone service providers with their displays of mobile handsets, showcasing the\nlatest high-tech devices not so much for their own sake but as a means of\nconvincing customers to sign up for the service.\n\nShowrooms like these were initially part of the expansion of electricity\nprovision from a luxury into a service which many more people could afford.\nThe Electric House in Mumbai was built as the showroom of a private concern,\nthe Bombay Electric Supply and Tramway Company (the seed of what would become\nthe city’s municipal electrical utility and public transport system). But the\none in Shoreditch was built by the local council to hasten the adoption of\nelectric lighting by making it easy to sign up for electricity: the council\nwould send someone out to install the wiring and lamps for you for free, and\nyou could even pick out a lampshade that matched your sofa. For households,\nthere was the value proposition of more and brighter illumination, but there\nwas also a positive, significant, nonmonetary externality: electric lighting\nmeant a reduced risk of fires, which was especially important in the poorer,\ndensely built and occupied areas of East London. Widespread electricity\nprovision was understood to be a social good. One major reason why the early\nprivate electric companies were taken over by cities to become municipal\nproviders was to transform the risks of privately held network monopolies into\na self-propelled virtuous circle, where reduced costs of provision could be\npassed on to customers as more and more buildings and households were wired\ninto the electrical grid. Electricity went from being a service (in the market\nsense of “goods and services,” something you could pay for or not, depending\non how much you valued it) to a utility. One way of thinking about a utility,\nespecially a public utility, is that it’s not just a service that’s valuable\nin its own right. It’s one that’s so necessary that, by default, everyone has\naccess to it, all of the time. Utilities provide the foundational layers on\ntop of which additional systems are built, including the goods and services\nthat take advantage of them.\n\nHaving recognized this directional pattern of niche or luxury, to service, to\nutility, we can observe it elsewhere. Once upon a time, GPS receivers were a\nniche or a luxury, the province of boaters and adventurers. Then these kinds\nof real-time location services found their way into personal vehicles as a\nnice-to-have service, like in a rental car in an unfamiliar city. But once\nlocational information became widespread, as on mobile phones, systems could\nbe built that used it continuously—not just mapping or infrastructural\nservices like delivery tracking or transportation, but everything from\nhyperlocal real-time weather forecasting to social services that enable users\nto find nearby friends (and not-yet-friends) to location-based games like\nPokémon Go to location tracking for ad targeting or other, less benign, forms\nof surveillance.\n\nHaving become a utility, where its presence is taken for granted as a\nsubstrate layer for other systems, the next step is to become a political\nright. That might be because the system meets a basic survival need, like\npotable water, or because it enables agency, as artificial light and access to\nenergy generally, or it might be directly political, in the way that civic\nsystems, including public education, access to social services, and democratic\nparticipation, are increasingly or even exclusively accessed online. As\ninfrastructural systems progress from utilities into political rights, we are\neffectively recognizing and codifying new forms of agency, or at least ways of\nproviding that agency; in Sen’s terms, it’s an expansion of freedoms that we\nhave reason to value. This transition occurs, in part, because the spread of\nthese new systems and the new forms of agency that they allow is a double-\nedged sword. Since they make resources cheaper and easier to access, it\nbecomes increasingly difficult to opt out in favor of alternatives; in Neil\nGaiman’s succinct phrasing, tools can be the subtlest of traps. What’s more,\nas a system becomes widespread, lack of access to it, for whatever reason,\nbecomes increasingly disenfranchising because its presence starts to be just\ntaken for granted and alternatives become less and less available. It’s no\nlonger about your individual decisions: if access is assumed, then _not_\nhaving access limits your ability to fully participate in society. It’s\nanalogous to the commitment to public education and the rise of universal\nliteracy over the past two centuries, from a 15 percent global literacy rate\nin 1800 to about 85 percent now. Part of why utilities become political rights\nis precisely in response to (or to avoid) that inadvertent disenfranchisement.\n\nThe transition from a utility to a political right is a general progression,\nnot a clean, stepwise process. It results from the commitment and work of\npolitical activists. Access to sufficient clean water, regardless of whether\nit’s provided through collective provision or not, is explicitly enshrined in\nthe constitution of South Africa as an explicit political right. Political\nrights to infrastructural systems are often expressed in the form of policy,\nas with universal service mandates that guarantee access to communities that\nmight otherwise be underserved, including low-income households or rural areas\nwhich fall on the wrong side of network effects. In the twentieth century,\nthat meant access to grid electricity and to telephones. In the twenty-first\ncentury, countries have begun to put universal service mandates for broadband\naccess into place. Finland was the first, in 2009, and Canada mandated it in\n2016. There’s a paradox here that helps explain why these countries were out\nof the gate early: the bigger or the more thinly populated a country is, the\nmore of a challenge it is to build out broadband networks, but also the more\nvaluable it’s likely to be to its residents. The peak of the global COVID-19\npandemic in 2020 and 2021, with the associated movement of many public\nservices online, is likely to be a driver for more such mandates.\n\nFinally, access to infrastructural networks is often _implicitly_ a political\nright. After Hurricane Maria, when parts of Puerto Rico lost electricity for\nas long as a year, I often heard people say something like “these are\n_Americans_.” Since then, I’ve heard it again and again after different\ninfrastructural failures and crises. Stressing that point is a clear\nindication that access to public utilities like electricity and clean water is\nseen as a political right, because if it weren’t, nationality would be\nirrelevant.\n\nThe Dinorwig Power Station is among my very favorite infrastructural\ninstallations not just because of the eyewatering scale—Electric Mountain!—or\nthe way that it uses natural features in the landscape to elegantly accomplish\na goal. Dinorwig tugs at my heart, not just my head, because of how it\nincorporates other values besides efficiency. It was built out as the local\nslate quarrying industry was in decline, and the workers on the project\nincluded retrained former miners. When Marchlyn Mawr and Llyn Peris were\nturned into reservoirs, the arctic char living in the lakes were relocated.\n(This seemed like a lot of effort to go to for some fish—arctic char are\nwidespread and commercially fished across northern Canada—until I learned that\nthey are locally endangered in the UK, just small populations that had managed\nto hang on in a handful of Welsh lakes since the end of the last ice age and\nwhich probably wouldn’t survive their homes being regularly drained and\nrefilled.) The entire power station and its facilities were designed to blend\ninto the scenic landscape. There are no marching rows of electricity pylons,\nsince the transmission lines are buried underground.\n\nInfrastructural systems, by their nature, are more than just technical—they’re\ninextricably social and political because they are intrinsically collective.\nThis is especially true for networks, which are shaped by the sustained\nrelationships of the people who live in the places they connect and,\nconversely, the infrastructural systems that are embedded in the landscape\nform part of that sustained relationship. Because they incorporate nonmonetary\nexternalities, both positive and negative, they can’t easily be valued or\nassessed like a consumer good, where it’s “worth it” to buy something or not.\nSo they don’t lend themselves to decision-making that focuses solely on the\ncosts or the returns on investment. An infrastructural network can encode and\npromulgate a set of values: _everyone should have access to clean water,_ or\n_electricity is a necessity_ , or _personal mobility is a human right_ , or _a\nhealthy population is important_ , or _broadband access is required to fully\nparticipate in civic society_ , or even _endangered fish should be protected_.\nIf infrastructural systems meet basic human needs, providing agency and\nfreedom, the form they take depends on cultural norms and expectations; in\nturn, the systems set and define those norms and expectations. Pumped-storage\nhydroelectric stations are used globally but I love Dinorwig in particular\nbecause it really foregrounds how infrastructural systems are built to fulfill\nhuman desires, and how specific, contingent, and culturally situated these\ndesires can be. What do people want? How can these desires be fulfilled? How\nare the desires of different communities balanced? How are the necessary\nresources distributed? These are political questions, not engineering\nquestions. But in infrastructure, the political and the engineering questions\nare inextricably linked.\n\nThe most radically important promise of infrastructural systems is not just\nthat they underpin our individual agency but that they can do so in a way that\nis democratic and universal. Most technologies are sold on the premise of\nbeing liberatory, but infrastructural systems have genuinely demonstrated that\nthey are, and they have at least the potential to provide that freedom in an\nequitable way. Over and over again, as new technological systems have been\ninvented and the networks have begun to be built out, their efficiency, their\nvalue, and the way they enable personal, civic, and economic agency have been\nrecognized, along with technical, social, and economic incentives to move\ntoward universal provision—to treat the services they provide as a public\ngood, in all senses of the phrase. It’s why good infrastructure is strongly\ncorrelated with not only access to resources, but with equitable, stable\npolitical systems. As infrastructural networks become more widespread and\nreliable, we begin to build other systems on top of them; this provides a\npowerful incentive to make them even more widespread, reliable, and enduring.\nAround the world they have been both the roots and the fruits of sustained\neconomic and political cooperation: enabling groups to use and steward\nresources that are held in common for collective benefit, and to make\ndecisions that are in the best interests of the community. Shared systems are\nused to meet basic needs, to provide services, to foster social connections,\nand to provide access to physical goods. Infrastructural systems are how we\ntake care of each other and plan for a future of long-term investment and\ncooperation.\n\nFor a long, long time, this is how I understood infrastructural systems to\nwork. And all of this is true. But slowly I began to realize that I had only\nunderstood half of the story.\n\n\n# Six\n\n# The Political Context of Infrastructure\n\nGrowing up I had the chance to see Niagara Falls in every season because, like\nmany South Asian immigrants living in Toronto, it’s where we went whenever\nfriends and family came to visit. In the teeth of a cold snap in the depths of\nwinter, Niagara Falls are an icy wonderland. Every surface is wreathed in\nfrost from the spray and the river is a mass of ice. But even in the grip of\nthe deepest, longest freeze, the water never stops flowing. The cataracts\nremain an awe-inspiring sight for visitors from around the world, every day of\nthe year. Niagara Falls might be a natural wonder, but they’re shaped by\npaired hydroelectric power stations and an international treaty.\n\nA few miles upstream of the Falls, next to the scenic parkway that runs\nalongside the Niagara River, are two large, windowless buildings. They house\nthe controls and equipment for the intake valves that divert water from the\nriver into huge tunnels that carry it around Niagara Falls and its rainbows,\nwhirlpool, and sightseeing boats, and under the tourist-filled city center, to\nbe delivered a few miles further downstream where the two hydroelectric\ngenerating stations face each other across the Niagara River and so across a\nnational border. Despite being in different countries, the power plants are\npart of the same electrical grid, coordinating energy usage across much of the\neastern half of North America. Both utilities have agreed to limit the amount\nof water they divert around Niagara Falls, and therefore the amount of power\nthey can produce, to ensure there is always at least a curtain of water\nflowing over the edge for visitors to appreciate. That’s especially important\non hot summer days when the river is low, energy demand is high, and it’s high\nseason for tourists, as on the day I visited the New York Power Authority’s\nhydroelectric power station. I found it surprisingly welcoming and fun,\nalthough I’m pretty sure it’s mostly geared toward schoolchildren, with\nplayful interactive exhibits on how the electrical grid works, models and\ndisplays about hydroelectric power generation, and even a movie theater\nequipped with vibrating seats, flashing lights, and sprays of water, all to\ncreate an immersive experience as we learn about how flowing droplets of water\nare transformed into zooming electrons. From the plant’s observation deck, I\nstood and looked out over the Niagara Gorge, across the turquoise-blue river\nto the Ontario Power Generation facility on the other side and downstream to a\nbridge that serves as a border crossing. As someone with close ties to both\ncountries, this physical evidence of careful, ongoing international\ncooperation means a lot to me.\n\nIn the visitor center, historical exhibits tell the story of how, in 1956, the\nhydroelectric generating station at the site collapsed in a landslide caused\nby water seeping into the riverbank behind it. Robert Moses, the urban planner\nbest known for his role in reshaping the roads and bridges of New York City,\nhad recently become the first chairman of the New York Power Authority. Moses\ntook charge of the Niagara Power Project and rebuilt the plant, now named\nafter him, as a secure power source for his city. The project was approved in\n1957 and opened just four years later in 1961.\n\nIt can’t be seen from the visitor center, but the design of the plant\nincorporates a reservoir. On maps and in aerial photos, it’s visible as a\npolygonal lake behind the plant, away from the river, and it serves the same\npurpose as the high mountain lake at Dinorwig, storing water that can be used\nto generate electricity during times of high demand and then refilled when\ndemand is low. On the other side of the ruler-straight eastern edge of the\nreservoir are Tuscarora Nation Reserve lands. Having decided on the land they\nwanted for the reservoir, Moses and the Federal Power Commission went to the\nU.S. Supreme Court for the right to break a treaty obligation and seize the\nsite for the reservoir by eminent domain. In 1960, the ruling came down in\ntheir favor. In the dissenting opinion, Justice Hugo Black wrote, “Some things\nare worth more than money and the costs of a new enterprise . . . I regret\nthat this Court is to be the governmental agency that breaks faith with this\ndependent people. Great nations, like great men, should keep their word.”\n\n## Who Are These Systems For?\n\nThe nature of people acting collectively is that they form, well, a\ncollective. Collective norms around infrastructural systems can manifest as\nuniversal provision, a commitment to provide an acceptable standard of service\nto everyone. South Africa, for example, which has access to water in its\nconstitution as a basic human right, operationalizes it with specific\nprovisions, including a free monthly allowance for every household. If\ninfrastructural systems are a physical manifestation of social cooperation,\nthat also means they’re a physical manifestation of the values and norms for\nthe group. So as part of the transition from a service to a utility, this idea\nof what’s “normal” also undergoes a transition.\n\nFlush toilets had already begun to catch on in London in the middle of the\nnineteenth century, so when Joseph Bazalgette designed and oversaw the\nconstruction of London’s sewage system, he made the decision to base it on the\nstrategy of using water to dilute waste and rinse it into sewers, to flow\ndownhill and downstream, into the estuary of the Thames River to be washed out\nto sea. Wastewater is now usually treated before being released, and this\nsystem of flush toilets, sewers, centralized treatment, and outflow into a\nbody of water is considered the “gold standard” for managing sanitary sewage.\nIt’s efficient in the way it leverages flow through a network, but it also\nencodes a set of social norms which were initially local but which are now\nglobal. To begin with, Bazalgette’s approach made perfect sense in densely\npopulated and rainy London, but it makes much less sense in places where water\nisn’t so plentiful, which is a large fraction of the planet. Remember how\nsurprised I was at my local wastewater treatment plant that the sewage was\nclear and nearly colorless? The way we deal with our smelly, disgust-inducing,\npathogen-laden waste is by contaminating large quantities of otherwise clean,\npotable water. But there’s a second issue, which is that discharging the\neffluent into waterways means that our food systems and sewer systems can\ntogether form a one-way trip for the nutrients in soil: from the ground, into\nfood, into us, and out into the water through our sewers. In industrial\nagriculture, those nutrients are mostly replaced with nitrate fertilizers\nderived from petroleum using the Haber process, which enables food production\nat scale but which is also a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas\nemissions. Other types of systems for managing waste, like individual or\ncommunity-scale septic systems, are often seen as stepping stones to sewer\nlines and waste treatment. Composting toilets, in which waste is converted to\nfertilizer which can then be returned to the soil, have been generally\nregarded as the province of weird hippies in North America, and are seen as\nsubpar, second-class systems by much of the rest of the world.\n\nIf we say that infrastructural systems are built in response to social norms\nand also shape social norms, that leads to an obvious question: Whose norms?\nWhat is the “social” in question? The technologies and systems that are\navailable shape expectations: not just the way that we live our lives, but the\nway that we believe that lives should be led. Across a community, this is the\ndomain of politics. As new technologies become available and are adopted, they\nenter this realm, leading to policy like the Rural Electrification\nAdministration in the U.S. (and its counterparts worldwide): the cultural norm\nthat everyone should have access to electricity, no matter where they live.\nInfrastructural systems have been an important means of empowering groups to\nhave full civic and economic participation, so they’re not just the result of\npolitics—they embody and enable politics. That also means that they’re not\njust about benign or nearly benign norms about tea and flush toilets. They are\nmanifestations of power, of structural inequities, and of systemic biases\naround who deserves access and agency, and who does not.\n\nThe group that controls the social norms around building infrastructural\nsystems is very likely to be the group with the power to make the decision\nabout what systems get built and where, about who benefits from them, and who\nbears the costs. Dinorwig is striking for the care that was taken to mitigate\nits negative impact. It’s a sharp contrast to the impact of the New York Power\nAuthority plant at Niagara Falls, where the construction had already been\napproved and begun before the Supreme Court decided the case. Robert Moses\nexpected to win the legal challenges over Tuscarora Nation land. He had good\nreason to: across the U.S. and Canada, dams and reservoirs for\nhydroelectricity had displaced Indigenous communities before and would\ncontinue to do so after Niagara. The cultural history and norms of those\npeoples were considered secondary because norms are set and decisions are made\nby those who hold the power to do so. In this light, infrastructural systems\ncan be seen, above all, as physical manifestations of the same kinds of\ncooperation that led to the Great Enrichment. They are networks that enable an\nexponential growth of wealth, power, and agency, made possible by energy use\nand resource extraction. Seeing them this way leads to obvious questions:\nWealth, power, and agency for whom? Energy and resources from where?\n\n## Recontextualizing Mapping and Networks\n\nOn August 14, 1947, when my father was twelve, he woke up in Pakistan. The day\nbefore, his family, his home, and his bed had all been in India, but at\nmidnight, Pakistan had become independent both from Britain and from the rest\nof India, which gained its own independence twenty-four hours later. With the\nend of British rule, the two countries were divided along what became known as\nthe Radcliffe Line. The Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten, had tapped Sir\nCyril Radcliffe, a lawyer without any training in geography or cartography and\nwho had, infamously, never been to India before, to lead the team to draw up\nthe new borders. Deciding on where to place the boundaries would have been a\ncomplex and thankless effort even without the backdrop of open sectarian\nconflict, much less the impossibly tight deadline: Radcliffe spent just five\nweeks on a task whose consequences have echoed down the decades. Partition, as\nit’s known, became one of the largest migrations in human history. Millions\nfled communities convulsed with ethnic and religious violence taking what\nbelongings they could carry, preyed on by opportunistic armed gangs. My father\nand his family were among them, leaving their home a few months after\nPartition and living in a refugee camp for months before eventually settling\nin Bhopal.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, mapping was a significant scientific preoccupation\nand a source of national pride. The sustained, even heroic, efforts to\ndescribe the exact geometry of our planet which were undertaken at that time\ncontinue to underpin all modern maps, including satellite systems. But you can\nalmost infer the imperatives for mapping in India—scientific, sure, but mostly\ncommercial and military—just from the dates. The Great Trigonometrical Survey\nof India was started in 1802, when the East India Company had taken over the\nentire subcontinent, and just a decade after the triangulation of Great\nBritain itself. In 1858, the East India Company was nationalized, bringing\nIndia fully into the British Empire, and then in 1947, those maps were used to\ndefine the boundaries of the newly independent states. In the century and a\nhalf in between, the maps were used to make the subcontinent legible to its\nimperial overseers, enabling Britain to cement its lucrative control,\ntaxation, and development of the subcontinent. Mapping also served as the\nunderlayer to the infrastructural networks built to facilitate the movement of\nresources around India, but especially _out_ of it. The Suez Canal, which\nopened in 1869 with primarily French investment and under French control, was\ntaken over by the British in 1882, first by buying out the local investor and\nthen by invading the region in order to impose military control. Control of\nthe Suez made it easier—faster and thus cheaper—to ship goods and resources\nfrom India and other eastern colonies for the benefit of the people living in\nthe UK. The new submarine and overland telegraph cables that were laid by 1870\nmeant that political control of India from Britain could be tighter than ever\nbefore. Even the passenger rail network in India, often considered a positive\nlegacy of the British Raj, was largely built to facilitate the movement of\ngoods and of British soldiers. It was paid for by guaranteeing private\ninvestors in the UK a 5 percent return on their investment, making it a net\ntransfer of wealth from the people of the subcontinent to middle-class\ninvestors in the UK.\n\nDuring the half a year or so that I lived in London, I regularly walked past\nIndia House, built after World War I to house the administrative offices for\nthe subcontinent as part of the political devolution of India in advance of\nthe region gaining independence (it now houses the Indian High Commission).\nThe building is decorated with emblems representing each of the provinces,\nincluding an elephant for New Delhi and a moon over a gateway to represent the\nNorth-West Frontier Province, where my parents were born. But the real\nmonument to British control of India was a block or so south, on the\nembankment of the Thames River. It was under my feet, and it was in the\nrailway stations, lines, and bridges all around me. Not for nothing does the\ngolden age of Victorian public works coincide with the peak of the British\nEmpire. Over the course of the Raj, the infrastructural systems—first mapping,\nthen railways, canals, and early telecommunications—that were built out across\nIndia facilitated political control and extraction of resources. These new\ntechnologies were powered by new sources of energy, like coal, and much of the\nnew wealth that was produced was sent to the UK. Historians have estimated\nIndia’s share of the world’s economy to have been 25 percent before British\ncontrol, dropping to just 4 percent or so by the time the country gained its\nindependence. Meanwhile, of course, the wealth flowing into the metropole was\navailable to be invested in collective infrastructural projects for its own\nbenefit, like Bazalgette’s sewer system and the cleaner river that was the\nresult.\n\nEvery story of infrastructure, trade, and European colonialism is uniquely\ncomplex, and I’ve just sketched the smallest part of one of those histories\nhere. I’m not going to commit the fallacy of thinking that human societies can\nbe explained by scientific and engineering principles. But framing this\nhistory in terms of exponential growth—investment, generation of output,\nreinvestment of that output to generate even more output—is a useful way of\nthinking about cooperative behavior in societies in general and\ninfrastructural systems in particular. Investment into these collective\nsystems can yield outsized returns, both monetary and nonmonetary. Growing up\nin Canada meant that I had an infrastructural birthright, the beneficiary of\ntwo centuries of unprecedented social, economic, and technological\ncooperation, with the snowballing wealth, power (in both the political and the\nengineering sense), and agency that resulted from it. That birthright set me\nup for my life of continuing freedom and security, including being positioned\nto benefit from new infrastructural systems as they were developed and made\navailable, like GPS and the Internet.\n\nWhile collective infrastructural systems can be used to benefit everyone in a\ncommunity, they are also used to funnel resources away from a larger area to\nthat community. I’m focusing on India because it ties into my family’s\nhistory, but the sun never set on the British Empire. The “Scramble for\nAfrica” in the decades around the turn of the twentieth century, during which\ndirect European control of the continent grew from about 10 to about 90\npercent, was largely made possible by new technologies of communication and\ntransportation, like the coal-powered steamship. When I walk around central\nLondon, all of the Victorian-era civil engineering around me serves as an\ninescapable physical reminder of the bodies and labor of people around the\nworld, including colonized and enslaved peoples. Infrastructural systems are\ndesigned to efficiently concentrate energy and resources to particular people\nin particular places. More money, more energy, more technological complexity,\nand more cooperation mean that these networks can get bigger and bigger,\ntransporting resources for the benefit of whoever controls the networks, which\nmeans they get more power and wealth and they can continue to grow out these\nsystems, and to build new systems on top of them. This isn’t a side effect of\ninfrastructure. It’s what they are.\n\n## Centralize the Benefits, Displace the Harms\n\nIn my home, clean water comes out of a tap, and sewage disappears into a\ndrain. Parcels arrive in my mailbox, and I put the waste packaging in the\nrecycling or the garbage to be taken far away. The electricity I use comes\nfrom generating plants on an electrical grid that spans a good chunk of North\nAmerica (and no longer from coal-fired plants in my neighborhood—I can still\nsee where several of them were once located, even if the buildings have since\nbeen repurposed). The natural gas that heats my apartment and hot water and\nwhich I use to cook my dinner is extracted thousands of miles away. It’s\nburned to water and carbon dioxide, and those combustion products don’t stay\nin my home—they’re vented into the atmosphere, along with the gases from my\ncar’s exhaust pipe and the jet engines from planes when I travel.\n\nThe infrastructure I rely on requires energy to function and is built out on\nphysical networks. All of that energy and all of those materials have to come\nfrom somewhere. Without careful mitigation, every stage of this\nprocess—extraction, fabrication, transportation, consumption, and use—has\nnegative effects: pollution and waste, noise and congestion, and more. All of\nthose harms end up somewhere. There might be environmental degradation\nassociated with the extraction of raw materials, like mining sites. There\nmight be toxic by-products of chemical processing. Thermal electricity\ngeneration produces a range of waste products, including the air pollution\nfrom coal- and gas-fired electrical generating stations and the solid\nradioactive waste from nuclear power plants. There’s noise and pollution\nassociated with transportation, largely produced by vehicles themselves.\nThere’s solid waste, whatever is left over when physical goods reach the end\nof their useful life, from microplastics to e-waste. There’s the effluent from\na sewage plant or septic systems, or residual brine from desalinating seawater\nfor drinking. How are these harms managed?\n\nThe possible answers to that question are closely linked to others: Who are\ninfrastructural systems _for_? Who benefits, who pays the costs, and where are\nthe resources coming from? As Langdon Winner put it, all artifacts have\npolitics: they embody and encode certain social structures, ways of doing\nthings, and what interests are served. That’s literally true in the case of\ninfrastructural systems. A federal interstate highway system that makes it\neasy to move goods around the country says something about how commerce is\nvalued; a modern and well-maintained passenger rail network says something\nabout human mobility as a policy priority. If a water treatment plant embodies\npolitics, so too does the storage reservoir at a hydroelectric station that\ndisplaces an Indigenous community.\n\nOne of the reasons why I appreciate the Dinorwig Power Station so much is\nbecause of the decisions made to minimize harms, like rehoming the local fish\nor burying the transmission lines so as not to spoil the view. What this\nreveals is that the beneficiaries of Electric Mountain and the community that\nwould be negatively affected were considered to be largely the same people:\nthe British public, plugging their kettles in and spending bank holiday\nweekends at Snowdonia National Park. This overlap provides an incentive to\nmitigate the negative effects of the project, just like there is for the\ncooperation between Ontario and New York State that ensures enough water flows\nover Niagara Falls to preserve its appeal to tourists on both sides of the\nborder.\n\nThis kind of alignment is rare. In Boston, the rail lines that head southwest\nout of the city were originally intended to be sunk below grade but in an open\ntrench, a much cheaper approach than covering it over to form a tunnel.\nActivists from the predominantly African American neighborhoods along the\ntracks came to planning meetings for the Southwest Corridor and interrupted\nthem by playing recordings at a volume that matched the expected decibel\nlevels of uncovered trains, thereby demonstrating exactly how disruptive the\nnoise would be. They got the point across, and the tracks now run in a fully\nunderground tunnel. There are literally thousands of oil derricks across Los\nAngeles, including both orphaned wells and active sites (which were finally\nbanned in January 2022) but the degree to which any potential health impacts\nhave been mitigated depends on where they are and who’s most affected. These\nare just two examples of how all decisions about location and mitigation are\nintrinsically political and can be used to systematically advantage or\ndisadvantage groups, even within a single city.\n\nThe more resources that are consumed, the higher the cost that needs to be\npaid. Wealth makes it possible to pay people and communities to deal with the\nharms; conversely, the less wealth that the recipients have, the more likely\nthey are to accept the terms. At the national level, coal mining or natural\ngas extraction in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia powers electrical\ngeneration all over the U.S., but the costs of that extraction are locally\nborne. And just as many of the benefits of infrastructure are in the form of\nnonmonetary positive externalities, the costs are largely in the form of\nnonmonetary negative externalities, hard to account for. How do you put a\ndollar value on mountaintop removal mining? Or polluting a region’s water\nsources? And who decides what that value is? For whose benefit? Wealth might\nmake it possible to pay people and communities to accept harms; conversely,\nthe less wealth that the recipients have, the more likely they are to accept\nthe terms. But that doesn’t mean the terms are fair. Worse, it means that\nexisting inequalities are compounded. If infrastructure is a way to provide\nthe comfort, safety, and freedom from basic needs that underpin agency,\nincluding economic agency, then these sorts of harms do the opposite, further\neroding access to opportunity of all kinds.\n\nInfrastructural systems that make it easy to bring resources and benefits to a\ngroup almost always make it just as easy and efficient to displace the harms\nassociated with extraction, consumption, and waste onto _different_ groups of\npeople, whether nearby or on the other side of the world. As these\ninfrastructural systems have grown in size, population reach, and geographic\nextent, the magnitude of harms—the negative impacts associated with vastly\nincreased usage of energy and consumption of raw materials—has grown\ncommensurately. It’s become possible to displace the harms of these systems\nfarther and farther away, creating a severe moral hazard: any incentive to\nmitigate harms is reduced by the ability to retain the benefits while\noffloading the costs onto, bluntly, someone else. Or, in the case of\npollutants in the oceans or the atmosphere, _everyone_ else. Whether you see\nnetworked infrastructure as collective systems that serve the common good or\nas systems that are designed to extract resources and deliver them to specific\ncommunities at the expense of others very much depends on your perspective, if\nit’s your home that’s been destroyed or your neighborhood that’s making you\nsick. In Stafford Beer’s resonant phrasing, the purpose of a system is what it\ndoes. Infrastructural networks could be fairly described as vast constructions\nwhose purpose is to centralize resources and agency to a small fraction of\nextremely privileged humans and to displace the harms to many others.\n\n## Infrastructure and Borders\n\nIn 2013, astronaut Chris Hadfield took a photo of Berlin, at night, from the\nInternational Space Station. Nearly a quarter of a century after the fall of\nthe Berlin Wall, East and West Germany could still be distinguished. In\nformerly communist East Berlin, the streetlights glowed the pale orange of\nsodium-vapor lamps, while the rest of the city was lit with whiter\nfluorescents. Borders, especially national borders, are the political\ndeterminants of where our physical bodies may be located. To the extent that\ninfrastructural systems embody sustained relationships, borders set the terms\nof who gets to be in them.\n\nA century and a half or more ago, most people would live and die relatively\nclose to where they were born. But for the small proportion who migrated,\nborders were effectively open and immigration was unrestricted, with some\nsignificant exceptions, like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the U.S. It\nwasn’t until after World War I that passports—and with them, nearly\nimmediately, restrictions on where in the world one might live—came into\ncommon use. A key implies the presence of a lock. As a child of immigrants,\nI’ve had a passport for as long as I can remember, certainly since before I\nwas old enough to have my own key to our family house. And as an immigrant\nnow, I always know exactly where the keys to my home are—if they’re not on my\nperson, the metal ones are hanging on a hook by the front door, and the ones\nthat are paper booklets are in the top drawer of my filing cabinet.\n\nJoseph Carens, a political science professor at the University of Toronto,\nargues that this social order—of relatively closed borders, where citizenship\nis an inherited privilege—has much in common with the feudalism of the Middle\nAges. Being born a citizen of a wealthy, industrially developed country like\nCanada is analogous to being a child of the nobility: regardless of your exact\nrank or wealth, you are likely to have a life of greater prospects and agency\nthan if you were a peasant. And like feudalism, this seems like an entirely\nreasonable way of ordering society to most of those who are to the manor born.\nCarens points out, however, that there is nothing that you can say to the serf\nin the field that could justify why they have a different lot in life from the\nnobles. My parents, born and raised outside of the moat, found their way\nacross the drawbridge so I could be born and raised within the castle walls.\n\nThe middle of the twentieth century largely saw the end of European\ncolonialism, at least nominally, with the establishment of independent states,\nincluding India and Pakistan. Colonies were no longer subject to control by\nthe military strength of the colonizers. (It’s not quite a joke that sixty-odd\ncountries celebrating their independence from the British every year likely\nmakes it the most widely observed secular national holiday in the world.) But\nwidely disparate levels of wealth and development mean that it’s still\npossible to displace harms onto groups that can be paid to take them on,\nespecially those that will do so most cheaply, like workers in regions with\nweak environmental regulations. This is especially effective if the people in\nthe communities to which the harms are displaced don’t have the option of\nmoving from one place to another. People in areas that are more affected by\nthe harms and negative externalities might want to relocate to the areas that\nhave suffered fewer harms and localized more benefits. Or they may even be\nforced to move, as is the case for most refugees, including climate refugees.\nThe migration itself is often challenging, even dangerous, but it’s the\nrestrictive borders that make it difficult or impossible to lawfully and\nsafely stay when you arrive.\n\nLike the majority of Canadians, I grew up close to the U.S. border, and while\nI live on the other side now, I’m still within a few hours’ drive. Over the\ncourse of my lifetime, the U.S.–Canada border has hardened, in part as a\nresponse to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It’s also because\ntravel and citizenship documents have become entries in electronic databases\nrather than physical objects, creating a fuller record of cross-border\nmovements and history and allowing for tighter control of passages across it.\n\nThe line between the U.S. and Canada is simultaneously invisible and directly\nobservable; on the ground, there is a six-meter (twenty-foot) “no touching”\nzone, kept cleared of trees and other cover for its entire four-thousand-mile\nlength. From the air, differences in land use are visible, since the\nnorthernmost part of the continental U.S. is adjacent to the southernmost\nparts of Canada. But at the same time, the border is permeable in important\nways. It’s nearly imperceptible in satellite photographs taken at night, for\nexample—the lights of southern Canada merge smoothly with those of the\nnorthern U.S., with Montreal and Toronto blending into the Eastern Seaboard,\nor Vancouver and Seattle in the west. Electrical grids have interconnections\nthat cross the forty-ninth parallel, and the freshwater Great Lakes straddle\nthe border and are managed jointly by both countries. Roads and train tracks\nmerge smoothly at the border into one network. We focus on the borders between\nindividual countries, but the most important border lies between wealthy\nstates with their robust infrastructure and energy systems, and ones with less\ncollective access to money and energy. The border between the United States\nand Canada, like those within Europe, is just a national border. But the\nsouthern U.S. border is more than a line between two countries. It’s part of\nan invisible ring fence around the wealthier nations of the world.\n\nThe most important example of displacing harms to communities other than the\nbeneficiaries is perhaps the one that appears the most ephemeral: carbon\ndioxide and other greenhouse gases that are produced as a by-product of\nburning hydrocarbons. These emissions disproportionately come from countries\nwith larger energy footprints and commensurate fossil fuel consumption. But we\nall share our one planetary atmosphere, which means the burden of managing the\nimpact of greenhouse gas emissions will fall on everyone, in some way,\nincluding the residents of countries who received few, if any, benefits from\nthat energy usage. With less access to wealth and the agency that it can\nprovide—including infrastructural systems—those communities will likely be\nmore affected by climate change while also having fewer resources to draw on.\nEven when it’s a matter of survival, borders constrain the ability of\nindividuals to move to places that are less affected or better equipped to\ndeal with famines, drought, heat, more powerful storms, or other climate\neffects. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is allowed to go everywhere, but\npeople are not. And as the impacts of climate change increasingly take hold\n(to say nothing of other phenomena, like pandemics), one response will likely\nbe increased political pressure to “secure the borders,” to make the fencing\neven higher and more deadly, a continuation of what’s already happening at the\nsouthern border of the United States or in the responses to migrant ships\ncrossing the Mediterranean, where nationality becomes a life sentence.\n\n## Mea Maxima Culpa\n\nFor most of my life, I thought of infrastructural systems just as these\nincredible technological and collective social achievements. It took me a\nshockingly, embarrassingly long time to recognize the inequity that is baked\ninto nearly every one of these facilities and systems. Why on earth did it\ntake me so long?\n\nPart of the answer is that these infrastructural systems hide themselves from\nour awareness by their steady presence, their taken-for-grantedness, which\nmeans these systems of power do as well. Infrastructure isn’t literally\ninvisible—as I noted at the start of this book, some aspect of these systems\nis in our field of view in all but the most natural or controlled\nenvironments—but it has become so inextricable from daily life that it is only\nrarely _perceived_ , nor does it admit any other way of living. It’s just the\nway that the world is constituted. How could you live without running water\nand toilets? Or electricity? And why would you want to? I spent all of my\nformative years in urban Canada, in a city that was long known, a little\nmockingly, as Toronto the Good, and a country that aspires to “peace, order,\nand good government.” My infrastructural birthright was extensive, and nearly\nall of it was public, a collective investment for collective benefit.\nMunicipal water and sewage, electricity from Niagara Falls and my local\nnuclear power plants, and Bell Canada for telecommunications. It included\ntransportation at all scales: the Toronto Transit Commission for city buses,\nsubways, and trams; GO Transit for regional buses and trains; VIA Rail and\nCanadian National for passenger and freight rail; even Air Canada for civil\naviation; and extensive and well-maintained highways. It’s barely an\nexaggeration to say that these systems were built _for me_. They were largely\nplanned and brought online or greatly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s, as the\ntechnological foundation for postwar economic growth. The human foundation for\nthat expansion was a policy commitment to immigration, including the non-\nEuropean immigration that my parents were part of. All of these\ninfrastructural systems worked more or less in the way that they were designed\nto and enabled what they were intended to enable, from an economic and policy\npoint of view. It’s not that I didn’t see the social norms embedded in the\nsystems and so I presumed them to be benign. It’s that since my only\nexperience of these systems was benign, it made it hard to see them as social\nnorms at all.\n\nInfrastructural systems don’t just hide themselves in plain sight. They can\nhide what came before them, like the way that highway interchanges can erase\nthriving communities with barely a trace. And the act of displacement is also\none of hiding from awareness. I might never see the communities where the coal\nfor power plants was mined, much less the Indigenous communities that were\ndisplaced by, well, everything—roads, railways, reservoirs, settlers, farms,\nsubdivisions. The more expansive the networks, the farther away the harms\ncould be. Large-scale electrical grids, for example, allow for stability,\nreliability, and coordinated oversight. But they also make it possible to move\ngenerating stations, and therefore the pollution they produce, far away from\nthe consumers.\n\nBecause I was in the metropole—the in-group to which the benefits flowed—what\nI saw around me for much of my life was steady progress. My world was becoming\nsafer, cleaner, and brighter, including a fair bit of harm mitigation, rather\nthan displacement. The generating station near where I lived as a child, for\nall the risks inherent in nuclear power, has mostly been a steady presence on\nthe lakeshore. Growing up, I saw the threat of acid rain recognized and\naddressed by the widespread use of scrubbers to remove sulfur compounds from\nburning coal, the rise of renewable energy, and finally the complete phase-out\nof coal-fired electricity plants from my home province. The hole in the ozone\nlayer was observed, the cause was identified, and the signatories of the\nMontreal Protocol of 1987 agreed to eliminate the use of CFC compounds in\nrefrigeration. It’s now healing steadily, the hole getting smaller every year.\nStronger environmental regulations around sewage treatment meant that Toronto\nbeaches and the Boston Harbor have become noticeably less polluted. And I have\naccess to entire infrastructural systems, in the form of wireless\ncommunications and the Internet, that didn’t exist when I was growing up. It\nwas perhaps inevitable that I’d only see the positive side of these systems.\nThey’re efficient! They’re for everyone! These systems bring us the resources\nwe need to survive and thrive together! That’s what they’re all about, right?\n\nSpending time in India as a child certainly helped me see and be aware of\ninfrastructure, since living in different places is a good way to realize that\nwhat’s familiar is by no means universal. But it wasn’t until I started\nactively learning more about these systems that I began to wrap my head around\nthe implications of building out massive, worldwide networks to bring\nresources to specific communities. When I began to look closely at the\ninfrastructural networks that I interact with, what I saw, over and over\nagain, was that almost every one of them reified social injustices in some\nway. I slowly began to understand what would have been obvious to anyone who’s\never been a member of any group that wasn’t as socially central as I was,\nwhether by income or geography or race: that you could look at these exact\nsame systems, and understand how they function, and conclude that they exist\nnot just to concentrate resources in a particular group in a particular place,\nbut to do so at the expense of other people, in other places. In this light,\nthen, all the ways of limiting where people can live, whether it’s redlining\nor national borders or even just neighborhoods that are only navigable if you\nhave a car, are about controlling who gets to benefit.\n\n## The Politics of Infrastructure\n\nThe collective and networked nature of infrastructural utilities can obscure\npower imbalances because there is often a clear benefit to scaling them to as\nmany users as possible. Not only are water and sewage treatment plants cheaper\nfor individual users if everyone is using the same system, but they also\nprovide everyone with increased protection from waterborne disease. Electrical\nsystems similarly benefit from the economic efficiencies of centralization and\nuniversal provision within a region. And transportation and communications\nnetworks become exponentially more valuable with the number of nodes. A\nnineteenth-century Boston landowner, even one who didn’t care about the lot in\nlife of poor people, knew that his family would be less likely to fall ill if\neveryone in the city had access to clean water. A twentieth-century Chicago\nmerchant benefited from more people being connected to railway networks, to\nsell and ship goods to. Twenty-first-century Silicon Valley startups stand to\nbenefit from more people with faster Internet access.\n\nBut even networked infrastructural systems are still only going to be as\ndemocratic and equitable as the societies that build and operate them. We can\ndeduce something about the power imbalances in a society by looking at what\nwas built and considering who benefits and who bears the harms. In more\nequitable communities, more effort is put into balancing, distributing, or\nmitigating the harms, in lieu of simply displacing them. We can also interpret\nit the other way around: the less effort that’s made to address harms, the\nbigger the expression of power imbalance.\n\nIn the U.S., urban highways are a well-known example of this imbalance. The\nFederal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 resulted in the establishment of a federal\nhighway trust which would cover 90 percent of the cost of new construction.\nIts initial authorization of $25 billion made it the biggest public works\nproject until that time. The postwar explosion of the suburbs, the growth in\ncar ownership, and this federal funding kicked off a countrywide highway\nbuilding boom. Across the U.S., interstate highways were intended to\nfacilitate trade, hence the federal money. But within cities, the main goal of\nhighway planning was to ease commuting by private automobile from the rapidly\ngrowing suburbs into the central business district. This might sound\nuncontroversial, but in the 1950s and 1960s, when the new highways were being\nsited, planned, and constructed, women were mostly excluded from the workforce\nand Black residents were largely unable to purchase homes in suburbs because\nof the practice of redlining, in which banks would refuse to give mortgages to\nBlack households except in a small number of “acceptable” neighborhoods. The\nend result was that highways in American cities were planned and designed by\nWhite men, largely for the benefit of White men, the group that benefited most\nfrom being able to drive between the suburbs and downtown. To this day, many\nU.S. cities still have a hub-and-spoke commuter model in local transportation\nnetworks, including public transit. Here in Boston, rather than cardinal\ndirections, subways and commuter trains head “inbound” or “outbound”—and, as\nin many cities, it’s notably easier to go down a “spoke” to the hub than it is\nto travel between spokes. The commute-centric model has long been at odds with\nresearch that shows that caregivers, still mostly women, are more likely to\nchain together segments than to make a regular in-and-out trip or, more\ngenerally, that residents need to be able to get around their own\nneighborhoods. Half a century after these highways were built, with the advent\nof the Internet and a pandemic that normalized working from home, the whole\nidea of a daily commute from the suburbs into the downtown core is being\nreconsidered.\n\nBuilding out new highways meant demolishing and dividing communities, and\nbringing noise and air pollution to nearby residents. In the U.S., this\npattern of urban highways being built through African American neighborhoods,\nas well as through neighborhoods that had large immigrant populations, is\nnationwide. It was considered sensible and justifiable by the planners and\nengineers because those were usually the neighborhoods with the lowest\nproperty values, requiring the least amount of compensation to be paid to\nexpropriate the land for public use. In many cities, these neighborhoods were\neven considered an urban “blight” of unsuitable or undesirable housing stock,\nwhich meant that planners considered it better for the residents to live\nelsewhere, regardless of what the residents themselves thought of their own\nhomes or where they could move. In both Canada and the U.S., similar arguments\nwere made for displacing Native American communities in order to construct\ndams and reservoirs—it was “low-quality” land, so it required only minimal\ncompensation to be taken by eminent domain, and the inhabitants should be\ngrateful for the opportunity to relocate to “better” places.\n\nThe Southwest Corridor in Boston, with the noisy trains, was intended to be\nthe Southwest Expressway but its construction was canceled in 1970, largely as\na result of resistance in the local community. They worked with local planners\nwho had observed what had happened with other new highways in Boston.\nInterstate 93 downtown was built through Chinatown, and Interstate 90, just\neast of the city proper, displaced a predominantly Italian neighborhood. By\nthen, there had been other successful freeway revolts all across the U.S. and\nCanada. The cancellation of the expressway in Boston was a stepping stone to\ngetting the entire Federal-Aid Highway Act amended so that it could be used to\npay for transportation modes besides just highways, including the Orange Line\nsubway that was eventually built in the Southwest Corridor.\n\nInfrastructural systems make it possible to accrue resources and agency.\nSimultaneously, and not coincidentally, over the course of the twentieth and\ntwenty-first centuries politically marginalized groups have fought for and\ngained power, and used their increased civic agency to advocate for equitable\naccess to the benefits of public infrastructure and to resist being forced to\nbear the brunt of harms. The fight over the Southwest Corridor in Boston was\nan outgrowth of the U.S. civil rights movement. Globally, we see it in the\nrecognition of women’s rights and the political independence of former\ncolonies. Democracies moved toward pluralistic, multicultural, multiracial\nsocieties (although not monotonically, nor without resistance). The\nglobalization of infrastructure in the twentieth century—containerization,\naviation, and telecommunications—means there is no longer an invisible other\nonto whom the harms can be displaced: the voices of affected communities can\nbe and are heard. The Janus-faced nature of infrastructural systems—of both\ncentralizing benefits and displacing harms—is increasingly visible, understood\nand, rightly, challenged.\n\n## Where Does This Leave Us?\n\nThe power, utility, and value of infrastructural systems are largely due to\ntheir collective nature. They are the most effective way that humans have ever\ndevised to empower people in their daily lives. It’s why systems like water,\nsewage, electricity, and communications are developmental priorities in\ncommunities that don’t have them, wherever in the world they might be, and why\ninfrastructural systems often follow trajectories that lead to their becoming\npolitical rights. They span the globe and are marvels of cooperation and\ntechnology, allowing a large fraction of the world’s population to live lives\nthat would be unthinkable to our ancestors, as recently as our great-\ngrandparents.\n\nThat also means that those of us with good, consistent access to these basic\nutilities are completely dependent on these systems to live our lives which\nmakes us extraordinarily vulnerable to their failure. We should be seeing\nthem, celebrating them, and protecting them. Instead, these systems have been\ninvisible and taken for granted.\n\nThis is in part because infrastructure hides itself. “Infra” literally means\n“below”—these systems are not just metaphorically but often literally\ninvisible, in our walls and floors, under our roads, in a restricted area, or\nsurrounded by a level of inattention that the science fiction author Douglas\nAdams satirically described as a “Somebody Else’s Problem field.” They’re\ncognitively hidden from us, because well-functioning systems are just always\nthere, to be taken for granted, calling for very little of our conscious\nattention. And the harms associated with these systems are even more hidden,\ndisplaced by means of networks and energy. The ever-increasing power of\ninfrastructural systems to facilitate that displacement means that there are\nfew incentives to even attempt to mitigate harms, except the most egregious,\nwhen it’s long been an option simply to find another place or community that\ncan take on those harms, either by payment or through force (or both). Seeing\nand understanding infrastructural systems is not just about recognizing their\nvalue. It also means squarely facing these entrenched inequalities.\n\nThe prison abolition scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore uses the term “organized\nabandonment” to describe the systematic removal (or lack of provision) of\nstate-provided services from marginalized racial groups. The consequence of\nthat lack of support is reduced civic agency: the inability to fully\nparticipate in civil society, including being denied educational and economic\nopportunity. I think of well-maintained infrastructural systems, particularly\npublic ones, as the opposite of Gilmore’s organized abandonment—universal\nprovision of systematized, physically instantiated state support. Inequalities\nin provision matter, and a failure to provide these services, or the failure\nof these services, is a form of organized abandonment. Without infrastructural\nsystems, we can’t fully function as individuals or as communities. And we are\n_all_ vulnerable to their disruption.\n\nI’ve been living in the U.S. for two decades now, and I’ve observed the\norganized abandonment in the wake of major hurricanes, particularly New\nOrleans after Katrina in 2005 and again in 2017 in Puerto Rico after Maria.\nEven after Hurricane Sandy in New York, there were differential responses\nbetween downtown Manhattan and less wealthy neighborhoods. Maybe one of the\nsaddest observations that I’ve made as an immigrant to the U.S. is that what\nhappens to the most marginalized groups in the country has often been a\nharbinger of what less marginalized, more socially central groups would soon\nbe facing. I thought about this in February 2021 when a winter storm resulted\nin a multiday blackout across Texas, leading to days of freezing misery and\nhundreds of deaths.\n\nWhether gradual or catastrophic, localized or widespread, the failure of\ninfrastructural systems is a particular type of organized abandonment. Any\nsignificant loss of these systems from our lives is recognizably dystopian\nand, to borrow from the science fiction author William Gibson, that future is\nalready here, it’s just not very evenly distributed. A failure of\ninfrastructural provision might be caused by something as mundane as\nundermaintenance, as out-of-the-blue as a solar storm, as infuriating as poor\ngovernmental oversight, and as all-encompassing as climate change. And none of\nthese threats are specific to the U.S. or any other single country. If we want\nto protect our infrastructural systems, we need to recognize and begin to come\nto terms with these threats.\n\n\n# Seven\n\n# How Infrastructure Fails\n\nThreats to infrastructural installations are a staple of thrillers, whether in\nblockbuster movies or cozy mystery novels—even one of Louise Penny’s Inspector\nGamache novels, mostly set among the quirky residents of the tiny, fictional\nvillage of Three Pines, outside Montreal, involved a subplot in which\nattackers plan to drive trucks loaded with fertilizer bombs to La Grande, the\nmassive hydroelectric dam complex in northern Quebec. Unsurprisingly,\ninfrastructural facilities have long been targets in warfare, but that became\nespecially true in the twentieth century as these systems grew in importance.\nDuring World War II, the British sent a specialized air squadron, later known\nas the Dam Busters, to carry out a coordinated attack on the industrially\nimportant Ruhr valley of Germany, breaching the dams and destroying\nhydroelectric power stations. A decade or so later, late in the Korean War,\nsimilar attacks by American bombers in North Korea destroyed 90 percent of its\npower generating capacity and caused a countrywide blackout that lasted two\nweeks.\n\nThese kinds of attacks—intentionally depriving civilians of survival\nnecessities, including food and electricity, as well as targeting dams,\nnuclear power plants, and other systems that can release dangerous amounts of\nenergy if damaged—are now violations of the Geneva Convention and so\nconsidered to be war crimes. Infrastructural systems continue to be targets of\nphysical attacks, of course, because those same characteristics make them\nhigh-value targets, especially for terrorists and other nonstate actors. A\n2013 attack just outside San Jose, California, in which multiple coordinated\nattackers fired high-powered rounds into the transformer banks of the Metcalfe\nTransmission Substation, focused attention on the risk to the U.S. electrical\ngrid. Those attackers were never identified and so their motivation remains\nunknown, but in recent years, particularly since 2020, the electrical grid has\nbeen specifically highlighted as a potential target by far-right extremists\nwith anti-government, white supremacist ideologies, and there is some evidence\nthat these attacks have been increasing in frequency. In general, these sorts\nof attacks result in relatively little disruption because power can be quickly\nrouted around the damage. But that’s not always possible, and a December 2022\nattack led to a multiday blackout for tens of thousands of people in North\nCarolina. What keeps these systems safe isn’t that they’re rare, hidden, or\nprotected—it’s that they’re either just taken for granted or considered\nbenign. But if extremist groups decide that infrastructural facilities are\nillegitimate and target them, they constitute what computer security\nresearchers call a large “attack surface,” with many points where they can be\nthreatened.\n\nDeliberately and maliciously disrupting the electrical grid on a medium to\nlarge scale is surprisingly challenging. Paradoxically, the same thing that\nmakes the electrical grid and other infrastructural systems vulnerable—that\nthey are distributed across and embedded into the landscape—also means that\nthey are generally designed for oversight and redundancy. This can limit the\neffect of bad actors, and failures cause downstream and localized effects.\nWidespread disruptions are most often caused by widely distributed events, as\nwhen severe weather downs power lines over a large region. Somewhere around 15\npercent of all power outages in the United States are caused by notably small\nbut widely distributed actors, although it would be unfair to call them\nmalicious, since they’re mostly squirrels, as well as raccoons, birds, and\nother animals who picked the wrong wire to perch or chew on. It’s been\nestimated that bringing down the whole U.S. electrical grid (which includes\nnearly ten thousand generation sites and two hundred thousand miles of power\nlines) would require simultaneously disabling nine of the thirty or so largest\nhigh-voltage transformer stations that are the critical links between\ndifferent regions across the country. Each station is about the size of a\nsmall house, but they’re like the Death Star—vulnerable to targeted damage\nfrom someone who has a basic idea of how they function. Nevertheless, taking\nout all of them would require a large-scale, coordinated attack.\n\nEspecially in the last two decades, the idea that critical infrastructure\nneeds to be protected, by force if necessary, has become well established. One\nbright midsummer morning a few years ago, I returned to the nuclear plant in\nPickering where I spent so much time as a child. I first went to the visitor\ncenter, and then for what turned out to be quite a short walk around the\noutside of the installation, because I was quickly intercepted by two\nconspicuously armed guards, presumably after being spotted on surveillance\ncameras. They asked me what I was doing, insisted on taking my phone and\ndeleting the few photos I had taken from outside the fence, and then politely\nbut unceremoniously put me into their car, drove me back to the parking lot,\nand stood watch to make sure I got into my own car and left. It was a bit of a\nnovelty for me—as a nice, middle-aged lady and an overly enthusiastic\nengineering professor, I’m not usually treated as a security threat—but it\ncertainly also gave me some uncomfortable insight into the degree to which the\nfacility was expecting and was prepared to respond to physical intruders.\n\nVirtual intruders and other network-based cyberattacks present a much more\namorphous and evolving risk to infrastructural systems. Colonial Pipeline\noperates one of the major pipelines for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel between\nTexas and the southeastern U.S., and in May 2021, its billing systems were\ntargeted by the hacker group DarkSide in a ransomware attack. Even though the\nhack nominally only affected administrative functions, Colonial shut down fuel\nprovision entirely because they couldn’t be sure the operational software for\nthe pipeline wasn’t also compromised. (It’s probably not incidental that,\nwithout a working billing system, they had no way of charging customers.) The\nresult was severe supply disruptions and fuel shortages for a week, affecting\ngas stations, trucking, and flights across the region.\n\nOperational control of infrastructural systems is always the primary concern.\nMy students and I visited our local water treatment plant in Needham,\nMassachusetts. The tiny facility has only a handful of staffers, and they\nshowed us how they can monitor the water treatment process remotely, from\nwherever they are, and can address issues without being physically at the\nplant. While it makes sense to connect infrastructure facilities to the\nInternet to help operators maintain continuous oversight and respond to\nemergencies, anything that can be controlled from the larger world can, almost\ndefinitionally, also be compromised remotely. I thought about the Needham\nplant when I heard about an intrusion into the control software for water\ntreatment in the town of Oldsmar, Florida (population 15,000), in February\n2021. The plant operator on duty noticed a cursor moving around the screen,\nand then saw a number on the display jump suddenly from 100 to 11,100. It was\nthe desired concentration in parts per million of sodium hydroxide, used to\nbalance the pH of water as part of the treatment process. Commonly known as\nlye, sodium hydroxide is a poisonous alkali that can burn skin, and someone\nhad just tried to make the concentration in Oldsmar drinking water a hundred\ntimes higher. The alert operator immediately locked the intruder out and\nreverted the system to the correct concentration, although fail-safes would’ve\nprevented the doctored water supply from leaving the plant in any case. As\nwith the Metcalfe attack, the intruder was never identified and their\nmotivation is unknown, but tampering with a public water supply in any way,\nfor any reason, and to any degree would never be considered unimportant or\nbenign. The attack was widely seen as a wake-up call to address the\ncybersecurity of water utilities, including the question of whether they\nshould be connected to the Internet at all.\n\nPhysical threats to critical infrastructure, especially charismatic\nmegastructures, get all the screen time; cyberthreats, with their inherent\nuncertainty and rapid speed of change, keep security researchers up at night.\nIt’s headline news when infrastructural systems fail. Their ubiquity makes\nthem vulnerable because it’s challenging if not outright impossible to protect\nthem as a whole. A reservoir for drinking water, for example, is usually also\npart of a local watershed, so it can’t be physically isolated, much less\nrelocated, and it needs to be protected from mundane threats like accidental\nspills as well as from deliberate attempts to taint it. But the flip side of\nthat ubiquity and distribution is that the most significant threats to these\nsystems as a whole aren’t coming from individual bad actors, terrorists,\ndisgruntled former employees, or script kiddies out for lulz and bragging\nrights. I don’t want to downplay the effects that an attack on a single\nfacility, like a drinking water source, might have. But the most dangerous\nthreats—the ones that keep me up at night—are those that function on the same\nscale as the systems. Physical and military threats—active human intent to\ncause harm—are only some of the possibilities. There are also large-scale\nthreats to infrastructure that are _unintentional_ effects of human actions,\nand ones that are the result of human _inaction_. And there is also a class of\nthreats that aren’t a result of human intent or action at all.\n\n## Gray Swans and Blackouts\n\nFictional threats aside, the dam at La Grande in northern Quebec has never\nbeen breached, but one cold March morning in 1989, a cascading failure\ndisabled the hydroelectric power station of the massive system in less than a\nminute, taking half of the province’s power supply down with it. The resultant\nnine-hour blackout included the city of Montreal and had ripple effects\nextending into New York and New England. It was the most recent and severe\nreturn of a phenomenon that had been observed more than a century earlier, but\nthis time it had very different effects.\n\nAn hour or two after midnight on September 2, 1859, gold miners in the Rocky\nMountains were woken by a sky so bright that they started eating breakfast and\ngetting on with their day. They were witnessing what became known as the\nCarrington Event, an enormous geomagnetic storm caused by the interaction of a\nmassive solar flare with the earth’s atmosphere, which produced striking\nauroras visible as far south as the Caribbean. But the powerful magnetic\nfields of a solar storm can also induce electrical current in wires; during\nthe Carrington Event, telegraph operators reported receiving shocks from their\nequipment, and subsequent strong storms have even started fires.\n\nA storm like this, in the middle of the nineteenth century, is a historical\ncuriosity. Now, in the twenty-first, it could be a catastrophe. Power lines\ncrisscross the continents, and the planet is enmeshed in a web of\ntelecommunications networks and surrounded by a fleet of satellites that\ntransportation systems, especially aviation and shipping, depend on for\nnavigation. All these infrastructural systems would be vulnerable to the\nfluctuating and powerful magnetic fields of another Carrington Event. A strong\nstorm like this caused that 1989 blackout in Quebec: the induced currents\ntripped a breaker in a substation, leading to a rapid cascade of failures and\nthe loss of control over nearly ten thousand megawatts of electrical power.\n\nSimilar but milder events are frequent and are part of what’s known as “space\nweather,” but a severe solar storm would be a “gray swan” event. Nassim\nNicholas Taleb popularized the terms “black swan” for a high-impact event that\ncan’t be predicted ahead of time and “gray swan” for an event that’s extremely\nrare and whose exact timing is unpredictable, but which can nevertheless be\nexpected to occur and to have a tremendous impact when it does, like a global\npandemic. The next Carrington Event would have the potential to knock out the\ngrid for millions of people, disable satellites, and cripple\ntelecommunications, with a financial cost that would be likely to reach into\nthe trillions of dollars for the U.S. alone.\n\nQuebec got a heads-up in the 1989 blackout, as its system is particularly\nsensitive to solar storms due to the geography of the province. It’s closer to\nmagnetic north, and long power lines running over the nearly exposed granite\nof the Canadian Shield (rather than over deeper soil) are especially\nvulnerable to the kinds of induced currents that destabilize the electrical\ngrid. But Hydro-Quebec is also unusually well positioned to respond to and\nprepare for this threat, and has already begun work on hardening its\nfacilities and building out systems to minimize the disruption caused by a\nsevere storm. It generates a tidy profit (more than 3.5 billion Canadian\ndollars in 2021 and in 2022, some of which came via my own utility bill, in\nMassachusetts) and, as a publicly owned power utility, it has a mandate to\nserve the residents of the province into the indefinite future. That means\nthat Hydro-Quebec has both the resources and the responsibility to protect\nagainst gray swans—it’s enough to know that one will arrive even without\nknowing exactly when.\n\nThe U.S. response is predictably slower and more piecemeal, given that its\ninfrastructural systems are a patchwork of public and private providers.\nStill, the consequences of the next Carrington Event are well understood and\nthere is federal funding and industry-specific guidance to make facilities and\nsystems less susceptible to disruption when it does arrive. The Space Weather\nPrediction Center, part of the National Weather Service, monitors solar\nflares, and makes predictions, providing daily forecasts to the affected\nindustries.\n\nWill Durant is credited with the adage that “civilization exists by geological\nconsent, subject to change without notice.” Major earthquakes are gray swan\nevents, and so are volcanic eruptions. Mount Rainier, whose majestic cone is\neasily visible from Seattle, is an active volcano. Any such event is likely to\nhave a huge impact on the region. Emergency preparedness is in large part\nabout planning for survival in the face of significantly damaged or otherwise\ninaccessible or unusable infrastructural provision. The impacts of natural\ndisasters, like a major earthquake or a volcanic eruption, depend heavily on\nthe way that basic services have been designed, built, and maintained. More\nthan anything else, poorly maintained infrastructure is much more likely to\nfail, and to be much more difficult to repair, under the stress of a major\ndisaster.\n\nThat brings us to another way infrastructural systems fail: via chronic, slow\nerosion, the kind that might be almost imperceptible—until it’s suddenly not.\nThese failures are less a result of human action than human inaction.\n\n## Under Our Feet\n\nOn their first day of college, I take my engineering students for a walk into\nthe past.\n\nThe college is currently only a few years older than our undergraduates—the\ncampus was mostly built in 2002 and is very modern with pale brick, high-\nceilinged atria and sheer glass walls. Our class walks out of the main\nacademic building, down the driveway that leads to the main road, and onto an\nunassuming grassy berm alongside a patch of wetlands. As we continue, it\nbecomes increasingly clear that we are walking on _something_ —a low, linear\nmound, far too regular to be natural. We follow it to the main road and\njaywalk across (sorry, parents) as the suburban drivers politely pause for the\nsmall crowd of students. On the other side, there’s a well-defined trail, and\nwe keep going as it crosses the access road to the municipal solid waste\nfacility. By now it’s evident that we are walking at the apex of an arch, and\na few minutes later we arrive at a small brick and stone building, set athwart\nthe path with its door padlocked shut and looking distinctly unmodern. My\ncurious students circle it, noting the stream crossing below, and if they\nhaven’t already, this is the moment when they clock that we’ve been walking on\ntop of an underground tunnel. It’s the Sudbury Aqueduct, built during the\n1870s to carry water from the western suburb of Framingham into Boston’s\nChestnut Hill reservoir, and is part of the Massachusetts Water Resources\nAuthority (MWRA), which supplies the region with much of its drinking water as\nwell as managing wastewater, including the Deer Island plant that I visited.\n\nI take my students out to the aqueduct for a few reasons. The first is to help\nthem learn to _see_ the infrastructure in the world around them—that cutting\nacross our contemporary campus is a century-old water tunnel, but that it’s\nonly apparent if you know what you’re looking at. At the end of class, I point\nthem toward the informational display about the Sudbury Aqueduct that’s tucked\ninto a corner of campus behind their dorm and I send them on a treasure hunt\nto find the nondescript blue-painted pin that marks where the buried channel\nfor potable water crosses under the road, sidewalk, and playing fields. I\nreceive a lot of selfies from my students, pointing at the pin and usually\nlooking delighted. They’ve only been on campus for a week or so and have\nalready found something that many of their classmates won’t notice in four\nyears of college.\n\nLearning about the Sudbury Aqueduct also helps them begin to get a sense of\nthe longevity of infrastructure, the way that older structures form an\nunderlayer for even the newest facilities. This particular aqueduct isn’t even\nin regular service. It’s kept in good repair so it’s available in\nemergencies—just a few years ago, it was brought into service when a pipe\nbroke in the next town over. I also want my students to begin to realize that\nthis aqueduct, with its charming signs and careful maintenance, is something\nof an anomaly, at least in the U.S. Unlike my enthusiastic and high-achieving\nfirst-year engineering students, the infrastructural systems around them\nmostly get failing grades.\n\nEvery four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the\ngoverning body for the profession, does a complete review of the state of U.S.\ninfrastructure. It covers all fifty states, and they consider transportation\nsystems, including aviation, bridges, roads, transit, rail, ports, and inland\nwaterways; dams and levees; drinking water, wastewater, solid waste, and\nhazardous waste; the energy sector; schools; and public parks. Each system\nreceives a score, and then the ASCE distills all their findings down to a\nsingle overall letter grade. In 2021, the most recent report as of this\nwriting, they gave U.S. infrastructure a C minus, up slightly from the D plus\nin 2017. It’s a grade that would be unimpressive for a student, but it’s\ndownright dismal for these systems on which we depend for our lives and\nlivelihoods. In their scheme, a C means that “some elements exhibit\nsignificant deficiencies in conditions and functionality, with increasing\nvulnerability to risk,” while a D is used for systems in “in poor to fair\ncondition and mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of\ntheir service life. A large portion of the system exhibits significant\ndeterioration. Condition and capacity are of serious concern with strong risk\nof failure.”\n\nVulnerability to risk. Strong risk of failure. This isn’t due to hostile\nactions or a cataclysmic natural event. It’s largely due to neglect—lack of\ninvestment, care, and maintenance, and all that follows from that. If a solar\nstorm is a gray swan event, then chronic lack of maintenance is like “red\ntermites”—a risk from a threat that is continuous but mostly invisible or\nignored, in the same way that insects chewing on wooden supports can go\nunnoticed until the floor collapses.\n\n## Things Fall Apart\n\nMid-morning on the Saturday of a holiday weekend in August 2018, in the\npouring rain, the cables along one side of a span of the Morandi Bridge in\nGenoa, Italy, snapped and set off a tragic sequence. No longer held suspended,\nthat side of the roadbed began to tilt, putting even more load on the\nremaining stays on the other side, which gave out in turn. The roadbed,\ncarrying dozens of cars and several trucks, dropped fifty meters into the\nriver and the industrial area below the bridge. Moments later, the central\ntower collapsed. Forty-three people were killed.\n\nThe bridge was designed and built in the 1960s, and was considered at the time\nto be the masterwork of its namesake, the Italian civil engineer Riccardo\nMorandi. He pioneered a technique of encasing the support cables in concrete,\nwhich he believed would serve as an inert barrier and protect the steel from\nthe elements. The Pantheon in Rome, after all, was built two thousand years\nago and is still standing, the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the\nworld. But just a decade after the bridge opened to traffic, Morandi realized\nhis mistake: the concrete was already deteriorating and, what’s worse, the\nembedded cables were beginning to show signs of corrosion. Bridge inspections\nover the next three decades revealed increasing amounts of damage and\nadditional cables were installed on several pillars (but not, crucially, the\nones that collapsed). In the spring of 2018, just after the bridge’s fiftieth\nbirthday, the private company that administered it put out a call for tender\nfor a €20 million structural upgrade. A few months after that, the Morandi\nBridge collapsed.\n\nI’ve broken an arm three—three!—times. Once when I wiped out on my bike, once\nwhen I fell over while ice skating, and once while I was on roller skates, at\nan introductory roller derby session (needless to say, that was the end of my\nderby-girl dreams). My penchant for breaking bones is particularly funny, to\nme at least, because I spent most of my twenties in graduate school\nresearching how the mechanical properties of bone tissue change with age,\nstress, and disease—in fact, when I fell on the ice, I went straight from the\nrink to the hospital that housed the lab where I worked, and was seen by an\northopedic surgeon I was collaborating with. My graduate work was mostly in\nmaterials science and engineering, where you learn that very few things fail\ncatastrophically because they are suddenly overloaded past what they are\ndesigned for, the way my radius and ulna were. The kinds of gradual failures\nthat I was studying are much more common, both in the body and in engineering\nstructures. Structures frequently fail in fatigue, where low levels of stress\nlead to creeping damage that accumulates over time. Without careful\nmonitoring, that damage goes unobserved and therefore unrepaired. In bones,\nfatigue failures show up as stress fractures, which are common in athletes and\nmilitary recruits. As we walk, run, and jump around, our bone tissue\naccumulates microscopic cracks, which are quietly repaired by specialized\ncells when we’re at rest. Overtraining, like repeated long marches while\ncarrying a heavy pack—more damage, with less recovery time—can overwhelm these\ncellular mechanisms. The previously unnoticed microcracks merge to become a\npainful stress fracture.\n\nAnother common mode of failure is the opposite of fatigue: rather than low\nloads resulting in damage accumulation, gradual degradation of the material\nmeans that it eventually can no longer sustain even normal design loads. In\nbones, this process begins in early adulthood, after our skeletons finish\ngrowing, and continues as we age. We gradually lose bone tissue over time and\nif enough of the material is lost, we become susceptible to osteoporosis and\nfractures, typically of the hip or in the spine.\n\nIn engineering structures, a gradual loss of structural integrity is often due\nto corrosion. The material of the structure degrades as a result of exposure\nto its environment, usually air and water, but also salt and sometimes even\nother metals. The best known example of corrosion is the friable brown rust of\niron and steel, but that’s just one member of a large and diverse family. Good\ndesign can minimize or control corrosion, and the exact approach depends on\nthe use case and the cost—we use surgical steel for medical implants and\nstainless steel for cutlery, for example, while housing nails are plain steel\nthat’s coated or oxidized. But corrosion is rarely eliminated entirely. Left\nunchecked, the end result is the same as fatigue failure: the structure fails\nunexpectedly during normal use.\n\nFor well-designed engineering artifacts, from bridges to locomotives to soda\ncans, failures are most likely to result from these sorts of gradual, low-\nlevel damage that occurs under “normal” conditions and accumulates over time.\nEngineers know that this kind of mundane failure is usually the biggest risk.\nBut there’s a real cognitive shift here, a gut-level professional\nunderstanding that just because something looks and functions like it should,\nit doesn’t mean that you can assume that everything is fine and will stay that\nway.\n\nThere is no getting around maintenance. Things fall apart. Fatigue\naccumulates, cracks grow, steel corrodes, and squirrels chew through wires.\nThe universe tends toward disorder, inexorably, unless we put energy in to\nhold the line. The first and the third laws of thermodynamics tell us that\nenergy can’t be created or destroyed, and that all energy eventually ends up\nas heat, but this is the second law of thermodynamics: that entropy increases.\nIn real, complex, material systems, the continued functioning of all\nengineering systems, including infrastructure, depends on routine inspection\nand maintenance.\n\nThe good news is that gradual failure is, well, gradual. The aluminum alloy of\nairplanes, for example, accumulates damage in a way that’s similar to bone\ntissue, with cracks forming and then growing longer and longer because of low-\nlevel but ongoing stresses, like pressure differences and vibration during\nflight. In a well-designed system, any cracks in the structure of the plane\ncan be identified, observed, monitored, and repaired before they become\ncritical failure points, which is part of why there are rigorous and carefully\nlogged maintenance schedules in aviation, and similar strategies are used for\nall sorts of critical systems.\n\nBut without careful attention to repair, systems degrade. It seems like this\nkind of gradual, accumulated damage should lead to chronic low-level failures,\nand it absolutely does. In the U.S., after decades of neglect, water pipes are\nnow being replaced at the rate of 1 to 5 percent per year on average, but even\nthis means it might take a century to replace a whole system. The pipes are\ndesigned to last decades but not centuries. Many water transmission and\ndistribution systems in the U.S. are getting up there in age—those that came\nonline in the middle of the twentieth century are now pushing a century of\nuse, and some, like the Sudbury Aqueduct, were built the century before that.\nOne consequence of these aging pipes is that around 15 percent of all clean\ndrinking water in the U.S. is lost to leaks.\n\nInadequate maintenance can also lead to acute failures, where systems and\nstructures can work fine until they suddenly don’t. Often this is because\nthere is a redundancy or a safety margin that is gradually eroded over time.\nBridges, overpasses, and other civil engineering structures, for example, are\ndesigned with significant safety factors, which means it often takes a lot\ngoing wrong before they fail catastrophically (and is why those failures are\nstill, thankfully, a rare and newsworthy event). Routine inspections and\nmaintenance are what help to ensure that the safety margin remains intact,\nincluding by revealing issues with the design or construction. The Morandi\nBridge, for example, failed because of a design issue related to corrosion—it\nwas underdesigned for the load it carried, with limited redundancies, because\nof a misguided belief that the cables would be protected from the salt air and\nindustrial pollution of Genoa. Routine maintenance led to the recognition that\nthis was an issue, although part of why it wasn’t addressed in time was\nbecause encasing the cables in concrete made it a challenge to get a clear\nunderstanding of the degree to which they were weakened. The Interstate 35W\nbridge, which collapsed over the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis\nduring evening rush hour in August 2007, was revealed by post-failure\ninvestigation to have had a more conventional design flaw—a gusset plate\nconnecting the beams of the bridge to its support columns was too thin for the\nload it carried, and it failed by ripping across a line of rivets. But it was\nalready known that the bridge wasn’t in great shape—it had been rated as\n“structurally deficient” in 2005 due to corrosion issues, putting it among the\nbottom few percent of the 100,000 or so most heavily used bridges in the U.S.\nFollow-up inspections the next year found problems related to cracking and\nfatigue, but remediation of the forty-year-old bridge was planned and shelved\nbecause of concerns that the plan for retrofitting would weaken it further,\nwhich meant that it instead had to be replaced. It’s painfully ironic that a\ncontributing factor to its collapse was maintenance work on the roadbed—four\nlanes were closed for resurfacing, and there were around 250 tons of\nconstruction equipment on the bridge.\n\nExamples like these help explain why I think of undermaintenance of\ninfrastructural systems, usually as a result of underfunding, as an actual\nthreat: a “red termite” risk. Like termites, these issues can be widely\ndistributed but still easy to miss or to ignore, especially in the early\nstages of infestation. But, as with termites, that lack of vigilance and\noversight can result in not just chronic or low-level failures but also\ncatastrophic failures of physical systems. Bringing down infrastructural\nsystems doesn’t require hackers or munitions. It just takes failing to provide\nthe expertise, care, and investment that keeps them running continuously and\nsafely. This was the case with the failure of the Edenville Dam in Michigan in\nMay 2020, which led to the evacuation of ten thousand people at the height of\nthe coronavirus pandemic and an estimated $200 million in damages. As a\nprivately owned “cash register dam,” the costs of maintenance were meant to be\ncovered by sales of the hydroelectricity generated, but for a decade and a\nhalf, its operators refused to make the mandated repairs and upgrades to a\nspillway that had been found to be inadequate. While this had eventually led\nto the loss of its electricity generation license (and hence, income) and a\ncommunity-based plan to purchase and operate the dam, the struggles over\nregulation and ownership meant that the repairs weren’t completed before that\nsodden spring. Neglect a system badly enough, or long enough, or incautiously\nenough, and it will be at risk of failure. Any sufficiently advanced\nnegligence is indistinguishable from malice.\n\nThis runs in the other direction too: the neglect of infrastructural systems\ncan be weaponized. In 2018, there were reports of outbreaks of waterborne\ndiseases, including typhoid, hepatitis A, and dysentery, in areas of Syria\nwhere the population was considered to be hostile to the rule of President\nBashar al-Assad. Assad’s military strategy for this region included not just\nconventional warfare but also arresting water treatment plant engineers and\nmaintenance staff, as well as withholding the chlorine needed to treat water\nsupplies—biological warfare by the expedient of making sure that the quiet,\ndaily work of operations and maintenance didn’t take place.\n\n## The Challenges of Maintaining Networks\n\nThere’s a line that’s become a bit of a cliché in the technology world, often\nused by start-ups that are in the process of defining what they’re making and\nwhat their business model is: “We’re building the plane while flying it.” The\nmetaphor is vivid precisely because of how impossible it is; even routine\nmaintenance of airplanes is something that we’d all prefer to have happen on\nthe ground, thank you very much. But because we depend on and use\ninfrastructural utilities around the clock, all the time, there is no time\nwhen they are “off the clock.” And without a clear understanding and\nappreciation of the value of maintenance and the work being done, even planned\ndowntime for maintenance is a disruption and can seem like a mini-failure to\nusers. (My friends who worry that I don’t get enough rest or relaxation have\ntaken the opportunity to point me to an industrial safety sign that reads, “If\nyou don’t schedule time for maintenance, your equipment will schedule it for\nyou.”)\n\nNot only do we take well-functioning, long-lived systems for granted, they are\noften _actually_ hidden from view, with a degree of accessibility that’s in\nproportion to how frequently we expect to interact with them. In buildings,\nthat means that light switches and outlets are conveniently positioned for\nuse, fuse boxes or circuit breakers are out of the way but accessible, and the\nactual wiring is mostly embedded in the walls. At the municipal level, the\n“infra-” in “infrastructure” is frequently literal, with pipes, ducts, and\nwires buried below street level. New infrastructural networks tend to be\nrouted along existing networks when possible. Telegraph wires were strung\nalong train tracks and phone lines were installed alongside power. Today,\nwater and sewage pipes, electrical lines, natural gas, and telecommunications\nsystems are typically run alongside or under existing roads, in part because\nthey’re a clear public right-of-way. But this multiplexing of infrastructural\nnetworks has a number of consequences for maintenance. For a start, any kind\nof utility work is likely to disrupt other systems—if nothing else, the road\nabove it. Especially in cities, it can even be hard to find the relevant bits,\nafter decades of accumulation and incremental changes. These systems are dug\nup and exposed when they need repair, and the repaired version isn’t\nnecessarily the same, or in the same position, as the original. Locating\nburied infrastructure is such a clearly recognized skill that there’s even an\nInternational Utility Locate Rodeo, where workers compete to demonstrate their\nskill at finding belowground pipes and conduits.\n\nShutting down services or roadways for scheduled repairs or upgrades is\nannoying and disruptive, but avoiding it is a bad idea, since the disruption\nof planned maintenance is usually rather less than that of unscheduled\nrepairs, if only because systems rarely fail at convenient times. It’s the\nbiggest argument for getting them right in the first place and then\nmaintaining the hell out of them, so they can be kept hidden away and then\nbuilt on or extended as needed, on a planned timeline, without having to rip\nthem up and start over.\n\nRedundancy is a hallmark of infrastructural systems in part because it\nprovides for maintenance and downtime, but it typically requires both an\nupfront and an ongoing commitment of resources. The Cambridge water treatment\nplant has _three_ parallel lines through it, each one capable of treating the\nentire city’s water supply—that means that even when one line is offline for\nplanned work, there’s a backup system if one of the two remaining lines fails\nunexpectedly, as well as an interconnect with the larger MWRA system, in case\nof a major disruption with either. The San Francisco ferry system that I love\nis relatively lightly used in comparison to either the roadways or the BART\ntrain system, but in the case of a major earthquake that could damage or close\nbridges and tunnels that cross the bay, a scheduled ferry service ensures that\nthere will still be a nonterrestrial route from the city proper to the East\nBay region.\n\nNetwork redundancy is valuable in more mundane emergencies too. Multiple\ntransit routes in cities, for example, provide flexibility to commuters. When\nI was living in London, I often took the Overground for my commute into the\ncity center from my flat in the northern part of the city. I liked taking the\ntrain because it was fast and comfortable, but it was also relatively\ninfrequent. One morning I arrived at the station to realize that I’d forgotten\nmy transit card. On my short walk home to get it, I pulled out my phone,\nlaunched a transit app, and figured out an alternate routing, via buses and\nthe Tube, arriving at my destination only slightly later than I had planned.\nParticularly as someone who’s spent a lot of time in U.S. cities where so\noften there are few good alternatives to driving, this kind of deep transit\nredundancy felt like the transportation equivalent of having three lines\nthrough the water treatment plant.\n\n## Sustaining Infrastructure Is Sustaining Relationships\n\nDeep in the Andean mountains, about a hundred miles from Cuzco, the\nQ’eswachaka Bridge is suspended high above the Apurímac River, spanning a gap\nof 38 meters (about 120 feet) between stone abutments. Once part of a network\nof routes that knitted the Incan empire together through the rugged landscape,\nthe footbridge still serves as an important local connector. It’s been in use\nfor nearly seven centuries, despite being constructed of a humble material:\ngrass. Every year, four neighboring Quechua communities come together at the\nbridge for a three-day festival, bringing with them the materials and\nexpertise needed to rebuild it. Long grasses are woven into bundles, then\ncables, and then braids of cable. They cut the previous years’ bridge free\nfrom its moorings, letting it fall into the river below. Under the supervision\nof a bridge master, teams weave the new bridge into place, starting at\nopposite sides of the canyon: first the cables, then the deck, and finally the\nside panels that serve as railings.\n\nThere’s a philosophical puzzle known as the Ship of Theseus. Following his\nreturn to Athens after slaying the Minotaur, Theseus’ ship was preserved as a\nmemorial, reportedly for centuries. But once a year, it was sailed to Delos,\non a pilgrimage to honor Apollo. The conundrum is this: if the ship is\nrepaired over and over again to keep it seaworthy, to the point where every\nindividual element of the vessel, every timber and line and sail, has been\nreplaced by a new equivalent, is it still the same ship? Infrastructural\nsystems can be real-life examples of the Ship of Theseus. We don’t have much\ndifficulty in saying it’s the “same thing,” whether it’s a suspension bridge\nthat is replaced in its entirety every year or a network of underground pipes\nthat’s been gradually but completely replaced over decades. One way of\nthinking about this is that infrastructural systems are defined not by what\nthey are or what they are made from, but rather by _relationships:_ between\nthe various parts, and how they interact with other elements of the network,\nand how we interact with them. When the routers that provide wireless Internet\nservice at a workplace are replaced with updated ones, many users wouldn’t\neven notice—from their perspective, all that matters is the relationship\nbetween computing devices, wherever they are in the building, and the outside\nworld, and the way they can continue to take it for granted.\n\nOn a drizzly gray London morning in 2017, I put on a hi-viz tabard—a\nfluorescent green vest—and a hardhat, and went through the gates of London\nBridge Station, on the south bank of the Thames, while it was in the middle of\na massive renovation project. It stayed open to passengers throughout, which\nmeant that the construction work had to be scheduled around the trains and the\ntrains had to be routed around the construction. Two at a time, tracks were\ntaken out of service, everything around them was removed and replaced, the\nrails were rebuilt, and then the crews moved on to the next pair. What it\nreally highlighted for me is that with infrastructural systems, there isn’t\nreally a bright shining line between maintaining existing systems and building\nthem anew. While bridges might be carefully maintained and inspected up to the\npoint where they are replaced, in many cases, maintenance is neither just\nrepairing what’s already there nor is it wholesale replacement. Instead, it’s\nrenewal, replacement in an incremental, planned way, much like the way that\naccumulated damage in bone is repaired by the body with new tissue. The London\nBridge Station, a newly rebuilt Q’eswachaka Bridge, or even something like the\nnew Zakim Bridge, all have largely the same set of relationships to both the\npeople who use them and the area around them, whether they’re train passengers\nsouth of London, foot traffic in the Andes, or drivers coming in and out of\nBoston on Interstate 93.\n\nInfrastructural systems require a sustained investment of resources. That\ninvestment can be built into the upfront cost (like building a water treatment\nplant in triplicate), into operational and maintenance costs, and into\nscheduled disruptions. And it’s built into renewal and replacement. In most\ncases, the cost of having systems that we depend on and _not_ paying for them\nto be robust and well maintained is even higher, in part because it’s measured\nnot just in money but in the societal costs associated with their failures.\nThe longevity of infrastructure and the sustained relationships that depend on\nits presence mandate that there is a smooth segue from planning and design,\nthrough operations, to maintenance during use, to renewal, to rebuilding, to a\ntotal replacement.\n\nBut there is one final piece to this, which is that these systems can’t be\nstatic. Even if they’re thoughtfully designed, carefully built, and\nconscientiously maintained, that wouldn’t be enough, because the world that\nthey are embedded in, and our understanding of it, changes with time.\n\n## Responding to a Changing World\n\nLike Lewis Carroll’s Red Queen in _Through the Looking-Glass_ , maintenance\nand repair of our infrastructural systems can be about running continuously to\nstay in place, perpetually fighting the good fight against the forces of\nentropy. But we don’t always want to stay in the same place. Sometimes we\nrealize that we’re in the wrong place. And sometimes we need to move because\nthe world moves around us.\n\nIf you live in a major North American city on a lake or the ocean, there’s a\ngood chance that you’ve heard warnings that some beaches are closed or unsafe\nfor higher-risk visitors because of high bacteria levels, typically after a\nmajor storm passes through. I grew up with these sorts of warnings for Lake\nOntario. They’re the result of a historic accident of timing more than a\ncentury ago.\n\nBack in the middle of the nineteenth century, when Joseph Bazalgette and his\nteam of civil engineers came up with a plan to build out a sewer system under\nLondon, buildings commonly had cesspits to collect waste. They were emptied\nwhen they threatened to overflow and the waste could be put to good use as\nfertilizer or used in industrial processes, but sometimes it just ended up in\nthe Thames. Whether it was in the streets and gutters or dumped in smaller\ntributaries, waste from the city eventually drained down to the marshy\nforeshore and then into the river, helped along by the rainy weather. Not\nsurprisingly, disease was rampant, with cholera outbreaks a regular\noccurrence. But the widespread understanding at the time was that disease was\nlinked not to the waste itself but to the foul smell that came along with it.\nSickness was a result of breathing “bad air” (this idea lives on in the name\nfor mosquito-borne “mal aria”). Avoiding disease meant avoiding this air by\nbeing on high ground or away from the densely populated city entirely.\n\nBazalgette’s proposal incorporated a series of sewers to collect wastewater\nfrom the streets and cesspools of London, channeling everything downriver to\nthe Thames estuary where the incoming and outgoing tide could sweep the waste\noff to sea. It was (please pardon the anachronism) a shovel ready project.\nThen, for a few weeks in 1858, weather conditions meant that the reek of the\npolluted river was so much worse than usual that the event became known as the\nGreat Stink. At the Houses of Parliament, right on the riverbank in the center\nof the city, it was intolerable. Legislators signed off on Bazalgette’s\nfunding and construction started almost immediately, with London’s first\nmunicipal sewer system largely complete by 1870.\n\nJust a few years prior to the Great Stink, in 1854, Dr. John Snow was treating\npatients in the Soho neighborhood during a cholera outbreak. By carefully\nmapping the locations of homes in which deaths occurred, he was able to show\nthat they were clustered around specific water pumps—strong evidence that the\ncause of the disease was contaminated water, not miasmic air, and incidentally\nbirthing the science of epidemiology. The evidence was compelling enough that\nSnow famously carried out a public health intervention by arranging for the\nhandle of the contaminated pump to be removed so local residents couldn’t\ndrink from it. But it wasn’t until after an 1866 cholera outbreak that the\nmain proponents of the miasma theory were fully convinced that the disease was\nwaterborne. Today, of course, managing waterborne pathogens is an important\nelement of sanitation systems. Cholera has never gone away. It’s merely held\nin abeyance, and when these systems fail, it can come back with a vengeance.\nThat’s what happened in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake that\nkilled over two hundred thousand people. The lack of adequate water and sewage\ntreatment in the aftermath made it possible for the pathogen to spread widely\nand become one of the worst cholera outbreaks in modern history, with more\nthan half a million cases and over eight thousand deaths.\n\nThere’s a sarcastic phrase among civil and chemical engineers—“the solution to\npollution is dilution.” Once a catchy summation of an engineering strategy,\nit’s become a bleak joke because, in the twenty-first century, we know it’s\nmanifestly untrue. We have a better scientific understanding of the impacts of\neven low levels of pollution, and we’re dealing with the accumulated waste\nmatter from several centuries of industrial-scale production. (Most obviously,\ngreenhouse gases that are diluted into the entire atmosphere of the planet\nhave become the _problem_.) The solution to pollution is remediation or,\npreferably, redesign to avoid the pollution in the first place. But when\nBazalgette was designing London’s sewers, the conception of how disease was\nspread by invisible pathogens wasn’t yet settled science, and dilution was\nwelcomed as a way to manage the stink. By the time the germ theory of disease\nwas fully established, Bazalgette’s sewers and embankments had been under\nconstruction for most of a decade, with just a few years of work left before\nthey were complete.\n\nMid-nineteenth-century London produced all sorts of wet waste—human waste,\nhorse manure, slaughterhouse remnants, industrial waste—much of which ended up\nin the gutters. Rain, particularly heavy rain, was welcomed for the way it\nsluiced the streets clean of filth, diluting it in the process. There was no\nreal reason to separate out what we now call sanitary sewers, which carry\nwaste from our homes, and the stormwater sewers that carry runoff from the\nstreet. Other cities, including major cities in North America, followed the\nBritish example and built out combined sewage systems.\n\nWith a new understanding of disease came a new strategy: rather than just\ndilution, wastewater could be treated to destroy disease-causing bacteria. But\nwhen there’s heavy rain, the volume of combined sewage can overwhelm the\ncapacity of treatment plants. Even though the stormwater dilutes the sanitary\nsewage to the point where it seems clean to our nose and eyes, it can still be\ncontaminated with dangerous levels of pathogens like _E. coli_. It’s why\nbeaches are closed for a day or so after a rainstorm, until the bacteria have\nhad a chance to dilute further or degrade in the open water. The sewer systems\nof many major North American cities still echo these decisions that were made\nthree thousand or more miles away and a century and a half earlier, before the\ngerm theory of disease was fully understood. Sewage separation projects are\nnow underway in many cities. Toronto recently built out a system to carry\nrunoff from the downtown core through a stormwater-specific remediation system\nand then out to Lake Ontario. In other cities, the work is piecemeal: as the\nsewage lines come up for maintenance and repair, the combined sewers are being\nseparated into sanitary and storm sewers.\n\nSewage systems around the world “locked in” a specific engineering approach to\nwastewater management and treatment, but new scientific understandings of\ninfectious disease coupled with higher standards for what’s considered\nacceptable meant that this approach has continued to evolve. The Deer Island\nWastewater Treatment Plant that I visited had a whole new system added to it\nnot long after it was built to meet the new, higher standards that resulted\nfrom the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and the\npassage and amendment of the Clean Water Act in 1972. There has never been\nsuch a thing as an absolute definition of “clean” water. We redefine what\n“clean” means on a regular basis as our ability to both measure contaminants\nand understand their health effects grows. The modern understanding among\ncivil engineers is that, no matter what advertisements for bottled water might\nsay, there is _no_ water on earth that is pure or untouched. As my colleague\nAlison Wood, who researches wastewater systems, puts it: “all water is reused\nwater.”\n\nBut even without changing our standards for what constitutes clean water,\ntreatment systems can become inadequate if they are allowed to degrade or if\nthe quality of the source water is changed. There are thousands of American\ncommunities with water supplies that aren’t considered to be fully safe to\ndrink, most of them because their water sources have become contaminated,\ntypically by local industry, and the municipality has neither the resources to\nbring the water treatment system up to standard nor the leverage to pressure\ncompanies to remediate the water sources. In Canada, dozens of First Nations\ncommunities have had drinking water advisories and boil-water orders in place\nfor a year or longer, for a range of reasons: heavy metal contamination from\nindustry, reactions with treatment chemicals that create unsafe water, or\nsimply because their treatment plants weren’t upgraded or replaced as they\nreached the end of their planned lifetimes or as the population they served\ngrew. None of these are the result of physical threats, or technical threats,\nor anything that would be part of an action movie. It’s just the result of\nregulations, funding, and oversight (or lack of oversight). But the end\nresult—a community that doesn’t have drinkable water—is functionally\nindistinguishable.\n\nFinally, some contaminants are new in the world. On that field trip to our\nlocal water treatment plant in Needham, we asked the staffers what concerns\nwere on their radar. Their response: “PFAS.” Per- and polyfluoroalkyl\nsubstances are a group of a thousand or more synthetic chemicals that first\nbegan to be used in industrial and consumer products in the 1940s but whose\necological and biological effects became a matter of widespread concern in the\nearly 2000s. PFAS are sometimes known as “forever chemicals” because they are\nstable and long-lasting—Teflon is an example—which means it’s likely that they\ncan accumulate in the environment and in body tissue. PFAS have mostly been\nmanufactured and sold by only two companies, first DuPont and now 3M, but they\nare widely used and now found in drinking water and other sources. New\nregulations are coming into place and—for communities that have the resources\nto do so—new systems are already being retrofitted into water treatment plants\nto minimize any potential long-term health impacts.\n\nThe risks associated with maintenance and operation might be the hardest to\naddress, but they might also be the most important. When people say that\ninfrastructure is boring, this is what I think they mean. The effects of\nmaintenance and renewal are invisible—if it’s done right, nothing happens. But\nit’s always a line item on a budget somewhere as an expense, and it’s a\ntempting target to cut back. Like the effect of hungry termites, the effects\nof inadequate maintenance are invisible until they aren’t. But the problem is\nnot even that underinvestment in maintenance is what causes the failure. It’s\nthat undermaintained systems become more vulnerable to anything else going\nwrong—they fail when the predictable degradation over time meets an atypical\nchallenge. Many of the biggest infrastructural failures that have happened in\nthe United States in the past decades have been closely related to\nunderinvestment in routine maintenance, including the California wildfires,\nthe blackouts in Puerto Rico, and the multiday Texas winter blackout. And the\nundermaintenance of infrastructure doesn’t occur in a vacuum, because it can’t\nbe isolated from design and planning, nor from renewal, rebuilding, and\nreplacement. Insufficient maintenance can really be seen as a symptom of\nsystematic underinvestment of societal resources in infrastructure.\n\n## The More Critical, the Less Appreciated\n\nFor those of us fortunate enough to have access to well-designed, well-\nmaintained public utilities that mostly _just work—_ they’re there when we\nneed them, twenty-four hours a day, making all the systems that we build on\ntop of them function without fail—then it means that, by design, we can take\nthem for granted. There’s a human cognitive bias that the less something\nfails, the less we notice, appreciate, or value it, no matter how important it\nis to our lives. No matter who you are or where you live, anywhere on the\nplanet, your daily life is either mostly about engaging in caregiving labor or\nmade possible by caregiving labor, or both—by cooking, cleaning, hygiene,\nchildcare, eldercare. As with infrastructural systems, it’s when that labor is\nabsent that it becomes most visible. During the peak of the coronavirus\npandemic, in 2020 and early 2021, the U.S. (together with much of the world)\nwas under a safer-at-home advisory, which meant that households were largely\nresponsible for taking care of their own daily needs, including childcare,\ncleaning, and meal preparation, with little outside assistance. It brought\nthis caregiving work into sharp focus for households, especially for those who\nhad previously been able to outsource these daily labors. Alongside this,\nthere was a new understanding of who the “essential workers” in our society\nare, including those in health care, food production and distribution, and\nutilities operation and maintenance.\n\nWhat defines infrastructure is precisely that we don’t have to think about it.\nIt’s not invisible so much as it’s transparent—we see through it to the tasks\nthat it enables. The idea of infrastructure as public utilities, and as a\npolitical right, implies that it’s available to everyone in ways that are\nlargely independent of economic status or geography—that everyone should be\nequally well served by water and electricity and telecommunications. And as\nlong as these systems are running well, we can mostly ignore them, even as we\ndepend on them. Being part of a community that’s embedded in and enabled by\ninfrastructural networks, particularly ones that meet survival needs like\nwater and energy, means that we can outsource their operations and oversight\nto a relatively small number of specialized professionals. We might all need\nthese systems, but working to meet these needs is no longer daily survival\nlabor for _anyone_ , much less everyone. In _Walden_ , Henry David Thoreau\nwrote, “A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can let alone.”\nNot thinking about infrastructure, ever, is an indication that it’s doing its\njob of invisibly supporting the rest of our lives. Infrastructural systems\nthemselves are a form of care, made possible both by technologies and by the\ndaily work of humans. But just as we still want to recognize, appreciate, and\nvalue the human caregiving labor that makes our lives possible, we need to do\nthat for infrastructural systems too, including the people whose skill and\nlabor keeps them functioning.\n\nThe journalist Michael Lewis described something that he calls “the fifth\nrisk” in his book of the same name: it’s the risk a society runs when it falls\ninto the habit of responding to long-term risks with short-term solutions.\nWhat I’ve been describing here—the sort of underinvestment in infrastructure\nthat leads to poor grades on an infrastructure report card—is part of that\nfifth risk. What societies need instead, argues Lewis, is “effective program\nmanagement”: all the actual boring work that needs to happen in the\ntechnologically complex world we live in. Building new facilities, with the\nexciting ribbon-cutting ceremonies that come with them, is a part of this\nwork, but mostly it’s having a checklist and a schedule and a cohort of\ntrained staff who can carry out routine inspections and maintenance of all the\nbridges in a region, with all of the funding and policy that entails, in a\nprogram that’s stable over a span of decades or longer. It also means careful\nregulation and adequate oversight of infrastructure providers.\n\nLike many other smart, technically minded, and not terribly socially well-\nadjusted adolescents, I read Ayn Rand’s novels _The Fountainhead_ and _Atlas\nShrugged_. The protagonists include an architect, an engineer, and a railway\nmagnate, and the novels are an extended dramatization of Rand’s philosophy of\nobjectivism, a sort of libertarianism that valorizes making new things and\nalso money, with a corresponding deprecation of any work that has to happen\nagain and again, every day. I read them while I was in engineering school, and\nI remember deciding at the time that it was pointless to make my bed and so I\nwasn’t going to bother, because I was going to be an _engineer_ and a\n_scientist_ and I was going to bring new things into the world. By the time I\nwas in my early twenties, my adolescent infatuation with the books had passed,\nhelped along by a few things: by how anti-feminist they were (I wanted to be\nthe male protagonists, not the female characters who were largely subservient\nto them); by going to graduate school to investigate biological materials and\nlearning firsthand the reality that much of science progresses by careful,\nrepetitive daily work; by having been responsible for my own household and its\ndaily chores for some years—cooking and cleaning and brushing my teeth, and\neven making my bed some days—but mostly just by growing up enough to start to\nfully _see_ all the people around me, and the roles that we play in each\nother’s lives. But it’s still really clear to me that many of Rand’s ideas are\nprevalent in culture, especially American culture, and especially in\nengineering and technology: they prioritize making things over caregiving and\nmaintenance, the new and novel over what’s sustained, ideas and artifacts that\ncan deliver a profit over activities that need an ongoing commitment of money\nand other resources, and individualism over acting collectively. As an\nengineering professor, I see examples of this nearly every day. It’s all about\n“Design new things and change the world!” Don’t get me wrong—I like new\nthings, all the fruits of the technological development that built the world\nwe live in, as much as the next person. But our sustained and sustaining\nsystems are widely considered unglamorous and boring.\n\nThere is no efficiency in childcare. There is very little scalability in\nnursing. Dental cleaning or cardiac surgery or pulling espresso shots or\nreplacing tires takes about the same amount of a skilled worker’s time, year\non year. In the classic example, the time it takes for a string quartet to\nprepare for a recital hasn’t gotten any shorter in the past century, even as\nnew technologies and modes of production have increased productivity and\nlowered costs in the world around them. Economists call this discrepancy\n“Baumol’s cost disease,” and even the name itself is a tell, since calling it\na disease categorizes it as pathological, something to be cured. But these\nkinds of skilled human labor, especially caregiving, can’t be made to happen\nfaster, or at scale, and so they do not get cheaper with time. Nor should\nthey. A former student of mine, Mikell Taylor, is a roboticist, and she tells\nthe story of hearing one of her professors, my former colleague Gill Pratt,\nrespond to a reporter who asked him about designing robots to take care of his\nchildren so he could concentrate on his work. Gill responded that the reporter\nhad it exactly backward—that he wanted to design robots to do his work so he\ncould spend more time with his children.\n\nIt’s easy to underappreciate the caregiving, whether human or technological,\nthat makes our lives possible as long as it’s working well (arguably, in fact,\n_because_ it’s working well). All of this makes it hard to understand the\nvalue of doing the work, and makes it easy to make decisions to scale back\nspending, since the best-case scenario for steady, reliable infrastructural\nsystems, whether public or private, is that no one notices them. The\nreplacement cost of the Genoa and the Minneapolis bridges were each in the\nneighborhood of a quarter of a billion dollars. There’s a strong incentive for\nlarge contracting firms to bid on projects like these, and to pay lobbyists to\nhelp make sure they get funded and built. In contrast, the financial benefits\nof routine inspection, maintenance, and renewal are diffuse—anyone directly\ninvolved might make a steady salary, but no one is likely to make a windfall\nprofit. That societal bias toward making and novelty and away from caregiving\nand maintenance is reflected in who makes money and how.\n\nWhat’s more, the nonmonetary externalities of the careful maintenance that\nkeeps infrastructure functional are even more diffusely distributed. Both the\nGenoa and Minneapolis bridges were crucial transportation links in their\nregions—it’s why they were both immediately rebuilt—and benefited hundreds of\nthousands of people. Every power outage, however short, exacts a cost in time\nand agency from those affected. So does every water main break and boil-water\norder. Having robust, reliable infrastructure doesn’t just happen. It’s a\ncollective form of care, paid for collectively, that creates both shared and\nindividual benefits. If one important role of infrastructure is to provide for\nbasic needs in order to enable a higher degree of agency, then universal\nprovision has the capacity to decentralize power in a community. Conversely,\nwhen infrastructural systems begin to degrade and fail, the negative impacts\nare widespread. It’s those diffuse, nonmonetary externalities that really make\nit clear that while these infrastructural systems are obviously technological,\nthey are also deeply social systems, embedded in daily lives, in the economy,\nand in political structures. It’s why utilities, whether private or public but\nespecially network monopolies, need to be carefully regulated to balance that\nintrinsic concentration of power. It’s why there is a relationship between\nwell-maintained systems and effective governance, because this governance is\nhow we make that diffuse power actionable and allow for collective decision-\nmaking. And it’s why seeing, recognizing, and valuing these systems is\nimportant. But increasingly, it’s not going to be enough.\n\n## The Oncoming Threat to Infrastructural Systems\n\nDuring the California fire season, crews go all over the state to fight\nwildfires. We’re used to thinking of firefighters as “first responders,” but\nthe first people who go out are California Department of Transportation\n(CalDOT) workers. They inspect the fire-ravaged roads to make sure that\nthey’re safe for the firefighting crews and all their gear, and make emergency\nrepairs if they aren’t. Utility workers are the “zeroth responders.” In the\nU.S., cooperative systems among public and private power utilities help to\nmake sure that lineworkers are available to make emergency repairs\nnecessitated by severe weather. Crews from northern regions head south to help\ndeal with the aftermath of hurricanes, and workers from warmer southern\nregions are staged across the northern parts of the country when a blizzard is\nbearing down. The power outages in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria were so\nwidespread and long-lasting because the grid was already fragile as a result\nof a chronic lack of investment and maintenance—further to the point earlier\nabout the role of equity and governance in infrastructural systems—but also\nbecause there was no plan in place to bring in lineworkers via these networks\nof mutual aid. Well-maintained systems with sufficient investment, funding,\nand staffing are more resilient to challenging environmental conditions, not\njust storms but also extreme heat or cold, or floods, or drought. But this is\nnow basically table stakes when it comes to severe weather, because what we’re\nplaying for has begun to get much, much higher.\n\nSolar storms like the Carrington Event are a huge risk, but though their exact\ntiming is unpredictable, we still know that they’re coming and can prepare.\nNeglected maintenance of infrastructural systems are the red termites—the\nwidespread but underappreciated threat that is undermining their foundations.\nBut climate change is the massive, obvious risk to nearly all our\ninfrastructural systems and the ways of life that they enable. Extreme weather\nevents have begun happening, and are going to happen a lot more as the\ngreenhouse gases in our atmosphere lead to climate change. It’s no longer\nenough to do a good job of appreciating, maintaining, and staffing the systems\nwe already have, because the stable world that they are built for—the\nunderlying landscapes that our infrastructural systems are designed to\ntraverse—has already begun to disappear.\n\n\n# Eight\n\n# Infrastructure and Climate Instability\n\nOver the last two decades, I’ve watched the South Bank of the Thames boom,\nbecoming home to skyscrapers like the Shard, the tallest building in the UK.\nWhen I was in London Bridge station, next door, while it was being rebuilt,\nour guide, a representative of the lead contractor on the project, casually\nmentioned that they were required to guarantee their work for a hundred years.\n_A hundred years!_ Then I remembered that the station had opened in the\n1800s—in 1836, it turned out, making it among the oldest railway stations in\nthe world. A century-long commitment for a station that’s already nearing its\nbicentennial suddenly seemed a lot more reasonable.\n\nStability of all sorts, including political and economic stability, is what\nmakes it feasible to front-load large investments of resources with the\nexpectation of continuing benefits over a long period. What we think of as the\nprimary characteristic of infrastructure—that it just works, and works\ninvisibly, to support other activities—is made possible, in part, by that\nstability. Over the history of the station, trains went from being powered by\ncoal to being powered by diesel to having electric locomotives. Vehicles\nbecame faster and more powerful, expanding and reshaping the transportation\nnetworks of the entire region. But what didn’t change much over the first\ncentury and a half of the train station’s lifetime was London’s climate.\n\nOur current geological epoch, the Holocene, began with the end of the last ice\nage, about twelve thousand years ago. Since then, our climate, landscape, and\nsea level have been largely stable. It’s this stability, in fact, that’s\nthought to have made the Neolithic Revolution possible, including the rise of\nagriculture, human settlement, and what we recognize as civilization. This\nstability also underpins our infrastructural systems since these networks\ntraverse the landscape, embedded in it and transporting resources across it.\nUntil very recently, humans have been creating infrastructural networks with\nthis implicit understanding: the weather might be variable, but the underlying\nclimate would remain stable.\n\nThat expectation has driven how we think about and build infrastructure. It\nsuggests that well-designed, carefully maintained, and thoughtfully remodeled\nsystems could remain robust and functional over decades, even centuries.\nStability of all sorts, including political and economic, makes it feasible to\nfront-load large investments of resources with the expectation of continuing\nbenefits over a long period of time. What we think of as the primary\ncharacteristic of infrastructure—that it just works, and works invisibly, to\nsupport other activities—is made possible by stability. A habitable planet,\nwith a stable climate, is the infrastructure to our human-made infrastructure.\n\nIf our metaphors for risk include red termites, chewing away the underfloor\nbeneath us in a crisis of inadequate care, or a gray swan that can suddenly\ncome flapping in through an open window in the form of a major earthquake or\nthe next Carrington Event, then climate change is, in policy researcher\nMichele Wucker’s memorable formulation, a gray rhino. Like the proverbial\nelephant in the room, a gray rhino is a high probability, high impact threat,\nbut one that needs to be seen and discussed rather than ignored, so we can\nfigure out how to deal with something that big that’s already in our living\nroom, knocking over the furniture and leaving gouges in the floor.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, global industrialized energy usage in the form of\nfossil fuels began growing exponentially, doubling roughly every two decades.\nIn 1856, Eunice Foote filled a glass cylinder with carbon dioxide and another\nwith air, put them both in the sun, and measured their temperature. She became\nthe first scientist to demonstrate that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. By\nthe middle of the twentieth century, the threat of global warming as the\nresult of greenhouse gas emissions was recognized and articulated. In 1880,\nthe estimated concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 290\nparts per million; in 2019, the global mean was 415 ppm. Because it scales\nwith fossil fuel combustion, the concentration has been increasing more and\nmore steeply. Of the ten warmest years globally in a century and a half of\nreliable record-keeping, nine of them were between 2013 and 2021, the most\nrecent as of this writing. A familiar visualization represents the average\nglobal temperature for each year in colored stripes, mostly blue and pink in\nthe past but increasingly red and darker red towards the present.\nAnthropogenic climate change is here. What does it mean for our\ninfrastructural systems?\n\n## Infrastructure in a Warming World\n\nThe first-order effect of climate change is warmer average temperatures, which\nmeans that the hottest days will be hotter and heatwaves will last longer.\nMuch of the population growth in the southern U.S., especially the southwest,\nwas shaped by access to air-conditioning and electricity to power it, the\ndemand for which will increase with higher temperatures. At the same time,\nplaces that have historically been cooler in the summer, like the Northeast\nand the Pacific Northwest, are getting hotter. Here in Boston the temperature\nusually falls to a comfortable level at night even during July and August. But\nhotter days, especially consecutive ones, mean warmer nights, which leads to\nkeeping the air conditioner running rather than opening windows. That\nincreased use of air-conditioning at night means power plants need to provide\nhigher output overnight. All of this means seasonal demand on the electrical\ngrid, which in the U.S. peaks in the summer (as of this writing, the historic\npeak in the afternoon during a countrywide heatwave was in July 2019), is set\nto keep increasing; without a commensurate investment in supply and\ntransmission, it means more days at the edges of its capacity.\n\nTransportation networks are also affected by generally hotter weather. In\nplaces that have historically been more temperate, transportation\ninfrastructure like roads, bridges, and railways may not be designed for\nhigher temperatures. Rails, for example, expand in the heat and can buckle.\nHot days might mean that trains need to run at slower speeds, or that service\nis suspended entirely, as during unprecedented hot weather in Portland,\nOregon, in 2021, and then in the UK during the continent-wide heatwaves of\n2022, including the August day when temperatures in the country reached 40\ndegrees Celsius for the first time on record. That European heatwave affected\nother infrastructure that relied on cooling—some data centers in the UK were\nshut down, and French nuclear plants obtained special waivers to discharge\nwarmer-than-usual cooling water because the intake water was so much warmer\nthan usual.\n\nIn many regions, a warmer climate will also mean a drier landscape, either\nbecause warmer temperatures lead to more evaporation or because of changes in\nthe amount and timing of precipitation. Hotter, drier summers means higher\nwildfire risk, as fires catch and spread more easily and burn more intensely\nin dry vegetation. In some regions, there’s an increasing risk of drought,\nshading into multiyear droughts, shading into desertification.\n\nIn the U.S., the hundredth meridian has historically been considered the _de\nfacto_ dividing line between the semiarid climate of the West and the more\nhumid continental climate of the East. The transition is easily visible from\nthe air because it’s where fields change shape, rectangular on one side and\ncircular on the other. Industrialized agriculture west of the line depends on\naugmenting the limited rainfall, most commonly with center-pivot irrigation. A\nquarter-mile long sprinkler arm, supported by wheels along its length, rotates\nslowly around a point and sweeps out a circle in which crops are grown. The\nwater mostly comes from underground aquifers, and the buildout of the\nelectrical grid across the continent, which made it possible to pump that\nwater to the surface inexpensively and at scale, transformed land use in the\nregion. Unlike surface reservoirs that are refilled seasonally, the aquifers\nrecharge extremely slowly, so slowly that they’re often described as\nreservoirs of “fossil water.” It’s not sustainable, and after a century or so\nof electrically powered pumping, the water level in the region’s aquifers,\nincluding the massive Ogallala, has dropped precipitously. Less and less water\nis accessible for use, including by the communities that depend on the same\naquifers for daily needs. A warming climate in this region would mean more\nirrigation over a larger area. Already the dividing line sits closer to 98\ndegrees west longitude than 100, and climatic models suggest that it will\ncontinue to move eastward, driven by faster evaporation from a warming\nlandscape. Without a transition of industrial agriculture to practices that\nrequire less water or are more drought tolerant, this may mean abandoning\ngrowing crops in the region altogether.\n\nFarther west, California’s Central Valley is the growing region for nearly all\nof the country’s almonds, pistachios, walnuts, figs and dates, grapes for\nraisins, and plums for prunes, as well as for vast amounts of familiar\nsupermarket produce like lettuce and berries. The fields of the Central Valley\nare so huge that even at seventy-five miles per hour, the minutes tick by as\nyou drive past them. They’re made possible by irrigation from California’s\nmassive, interpenetrating water systems. Much of that water starts off as\nwinter snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, where warmer weather might\nmean more rain and less snow. That means less stored water, not just in the\nreservoirs filled by rushing meltwater in the spring but because the snowpack\n_itself_ provides a huge amount of storage capacity. This in turn affects the\navailability of water not only for agriculture, but also for household use and\nhydroelectricity. In the western U.S., where regional systems span state and\ninternational borders, allocating water for these critical needs has never\nbeen simple or harmonious and will only become more complex and contentious if\nless water is available to share. A more subtle challenge has to do with\ntiming. The accumulated snow in the mountains of northern California melts\ngradually over the spring and summer, which means that reservoirs are refilled\nand there is a steady supply to the water system through the all-but-rainless\nlate summer and early autumn, delivering water during peak usage in the\nCentral Valley as harvest time nears for the growing crops. But a smaller\nsnowpack in the mountains will also melt faster, meaning not only that there\nwill be less water available late in the season, but that peak water delivery\nmay no longer coincide with peak preharvest demand. The landscape and climate\nthat it was designed for no longer exist.\n\nThis is obviously just the barest sketch of the ways that infrastructural\nsystems are affected by warming, and of the host of changes and adjustments—if\nnot outright reconsideration, redesign, and rebuilding—that will be required\nfor them to continue to function effectively in a warmer climate. But\nanthropogenic climate change means more than just a steady-state increase in\ntemperature.\n\n## The Cumulative Impact of Design Days\n\nThe engineers that spec out the heating and cooling systems for buildings\n(known as HVAC, for “heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning”) use the term\n“design days” for the hottest or coldest days of the year, the days that\ndemand the most of building systems, and they are usually design days for the\nunderlying infrastructural utilities, too. In the metropolitan Boston area,\nwhere most homes are heated with utility gas, demand during cold snaps in the\ndead of winter can max out pipeline deliveries into the region. To ensure that\nthere’s enough fuel available, liquefied natural gas is delivered by ship to a\nfacility in Boston Harbor where it’s turned back into a gas and injected into\nthe distribution network. Delivering service at peak loads is often the\nbiggest challenge for infrastructure. It frequently requires pricy solutions,\nwhether it’s closing down a busy harbor to safely deliver tankers full of fuel\nor firing up expensive peaker plants to ensure there’s enough electricity in\nthe grid.\n\nWhat’s more, design days are _risky_ days—when the entire capacity of a system\nis in use, there’s little redundancy or room for error. In August 2020, a\ncritical shortage of energy in California meant that an estimated four million\npeople had their power shut off during a heat wave; a similar widespread\nblackout was feared on that hot afternoon in 2022 when the text message went\nout asking residents to conserve power. During the European heatwave in July\n2022, blackouts in East London were narrowly averted by the purchase of\nelectricity from Belgium at _fifty_ times the normal cost, nearly five times\nthe previous record high. It wasn’t even that there wasn’t enough electricity\non the island of Great Britain; it was because of a bottlenecked electrical\ngrid with no remaining capacity to transmit energy south from Scotland to the\ncapital.\n\nA few miles downstream of London Bridge is the Thames Barrier, a line of\ngleaming steel seashells that crosses the river, each a hydraulically powered\ngate that can be raised to protect the low-lying city from flooding due to\nheavy rains or storm surges. The barrier was designed in the early 1970s and\nbecame operational in 1982, with the expectation that it’d be used two or\nthree times per year. In the 2000s, the gates were closed six or seven times\neach year; in 2013, the barriers were raised dozens of times due to heavy\nrains and to limit the tidal effects in the city. Current models suggest that\nthe Thames Barrier can remain functional until 2070 or so, even if it’s used\nmore than a few times each year, although it will require something like £3\nbillion in maintenance work over that time so it can continue to be among the\nfloodwater protection strategies in the climate adaptation plan for the London\narea.\n\nMore extreme weather conditions are part of the challenge of anthropogenic\nclimate change. Civil engineers design infrastructural systems for bad weather\nby analyzing all the data that’s available in the past. A “hundred-year storm”\nmeans there is a 1 percent chance that a storm with that severity will hit in\nany given year, so if you’re building a facility or system that might last for\ndecades, there’s a reasonable chance that one of those storms will hit during\nits lifetime. It’s worth designing critical utilities to withstand them, along\nwith a healthy margin of error. But what if the climate of the future isn’t\nlike that of the past? What happens if hundred-year storms arrive more\nfrequently, and the “new” hundred-year storms are even more severe?\n\nIn October 2018, for the first time in its history, the city of Austin, Texas,\nissued a boil-water order. Heavy storms and flooding (the third “hundred-year\nstorm” in the region in five years) had washed silt and debris into the\nreservoir that supplies the municipal treatment plant, overwhelming the design\ncapacity of the system. It wasn’t a lapse in maintenance or a design\nfailure—it was simply that the worst-case scenario of the present day had\nexceeded what the civil engineers had designed for.\n\nThese types of failures are set to become increasingly common worldwide. Even\nsmall, gradual changes in temperature, in average rainfall, or in sea level\ncan have noticeable effects. For example, climate models predict that\nhurricanes will become more intense and damaging. While the specific dynamics\nare complex, the energy that powers hurricanes comes from thermal energy.\nWarmer air over the ocean holds more moisture to fall as torrential rain;\nwarmer ocean water powers the hurricane-force winds that damage buildings and\ndown power lines. Higher sea levels mean higher storm surges and therefore\nmore coastal flooding. Even if they don’t hit their design limits and avoid\nbeing fully overwhelmed, more severe weather means that infrastructural\nsystems will be operating closer and closer to the edge of capacity and are\nlikely to need more maintenance to keep them in good repair.\n\n## From Global Warming to Global Weirding\n\nEngineers and scientists have a term for when someone gets really, really\nupset at something that seems inconsequential—they call it “going nonlinear.”\nIn mathematical terms, a linear response is proportional to the input: a\ngentle stimulus evokes a mild response, a stronger stimulus evokes a more\nrobust output. When something—or someone—goes nonlinear, all bets are off. The\nresponse might be all out of proportion to what happened, like someone getting\ntoweringly angry in response to a minor quibble.\n\nAs our planet gets warmer, familiar events like heatwaves will increase in\nseverity or duration, with largely predictable effects on our infrastructural\nsystems. But there will also be more events that are nonlinear—harder to\npredict, and with much more severe effects. Giant wildfires producing world-\ngirdling smoke on both sides of the Pacific Ocean in 2020 (Australia’s “Black\nSummer” at the start of the year was followed by a record-setting California\nfire season at its end) is a decidedly nonlinear response to a small increase\nin temperature for a few months and the somewhat drier vegetation that\nresulted. This is not so much global warming as global _weirding_. All of our\ninfrastructural systems—for that matter, nearly all human systems—have been\ncreated assuming that, however variable the weather might be, the underlying\nclimate is stable. Now we are starting to deal with the very real possibility\nof human systems being out of spec because, for the first time in all of human\nhistory, the climate is changing rapidly and potentially in ways that aren’t\neasy to model or predict, or that we don’t yet have the data to understand\nfully. This includes the possibility of tipping points. What might happen if\nthe Arctic permafrost melts and releases trapped methane, itself a greenhouse\ngas? Or if ocean circulation systems, like the North Atlantic Drift, weaken or\neven collapse? Without currents which transport warm water to higher\nlatitudes, western Europe might become as cold as western Canada.\n\nThese are all potential effects of climate change, in the near future and with\nmodest amounts of warming. But what really matters is not so much the effects\nas the _impacts_ : food and water insecurity, the danger of extreme heat,\nespecially for the large fraction of the world that can’t just turn the air-\nconditioning up, the likelihood of large-scale climate migration, and the\nhuman suffering that will result from all of the above, either directly or as\na result of resource conflict (to say nothing of the toll on nonhuman species\nand the likelihood of irreversible damage to ecosystems).\n\nIn a world where climate stability is being replaced with instability,\ninfrastructural systems are simultaneously more vulnerable and more necessary.\nThe degree to which these systems remain functional is often exactly what\ndetermines the severity of a disaster, whether it’s the roads and other\ntransportation networks that make it possible to evacuate a city in the face\nof wildfire threats, or the water systems and electrical grids and\ntelecommunications networks that stay operational when a hurricane makes\nlandfall and allow residents to safely shelter in place. There is no response\nto climate change that doesn’t involve infrastructural systems.\n\nBut it’s not just that our infrastructural systems will be—are being—affected\nby anthropogenic climate change. The real problem is that our infrastructural\nsystems consume energy, and as long as they are primarily powered by fossil\nfuels, they will continue to be one of the main _drivers_ of climate change.\n\n## Collective Systems Mean Collective Energy Use\n\nTo do anything—to actively engage in the world in any way—requires energy.\nEnergy that comes from fossil fuels results in greenhouse gas emissions and as\nlong as access to energy means combustion, then energy and carbon footprints\nwill be closely related, if not outright synonymous.\n\nIn the U.S., about half of the pollutants that contribute to anthropogenic\nclimate change are directly attributable either to the energy and electricity\nwe use in our homes and workplaces or to vehicles on transportation networks.\nThe U.S. isn’t an outlier—this pattern of energy usage and emissions is pretty\ntypical of industrially developed countries in the Global North. The majority\nof greenhouse gas emissions are mediated through the shared technological\nsystems of infrastructure. Anthropogenic climate change poses a threat to\ninfrastructural systems, but our infrastructural systems are also the biggest\n_contributor_ to climate change.\n\nThat means we find ourselves in what seems, on the surface, to be an\nintractable conundrum. We’ve created these collective infrastructural systems\nthat make our lives, as we know them, possible. Any future with limited,\nreduced, or even more frequently interrupted access to them is recognizably\nworse than our present, if not outright dystopian. We can’t stop using them.\n\nBut by their nature, infrastructural systems are particularly vulnerable to\nclimate instability. The worse it gets, the less well these systems will work.\nAnd because the energy that powers infrastructural systems largely comes from\nfossil fuels, the more we use them, the worse it gets.\n\nBut there’s a way out. Or rather, a way _through_.\n\nThe first step is to break the connection between combustion and energy, to\nmake it possible to generate, distribute, store, and consume energy without\nproducing pollutants. As a civilization, we’ve spent most of the past century\ndeveloping a way to do that: electrification, and working out how to produce\nlight, heat, and motion, on scales ranging from the tiniest LED to the largest\nindustrial facilities. Hydroelectric and nuclear power plants are large-scale,\ntwentieth-century technologies for harnessing energy without combustion;\nfacilities like Dinorwig are a means of storing that energy at scale;\ncontinent-wide electrical grids allow for distribution. They’ve now been\njoined by twenty-first century technologies, those invented, developed, and\ncommodified over the past several decades: wind turbines, solar panels,\nelectric vehicles, grid-scale batteries, even the microwave oven, and the\ncommunication and computation infrastructure that allows for the coordination\nof all these systems.\n\nAs long as the only way to access appreciable amounts of energy for human use\nwas through combustion, the only way to reduce emissions was by using less\nenergy. By transitioning our technological systems to instead use electricity,\ngenerated from renewable sources, we can keep all of the social and economic\nbenefits of access to energy, including all of the agency that it provides and\nthe ways of life that it supports, without paying the self-defeating (or\noutright ecocidal) cost of putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nIn a very real sense, anthropogenic climate change has been happening for the\npast two centuries, since the beginning of that exponential growth in energy\nusage powered first by coal and then by petroleum and gas. That elapsed time\nmeans that there’s been enough accumulation of greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere and enough time to collect (and learn how to collect) data that we\ncan experimentally observe its impact. Because we’ve moved further up an ever-\nsteepening exponential growth curve, the _rate_ of change is much higher.\nWhile there’s no “acceptable” amount of global warming, there’s also no point\nat which all is lost, no point at which it is futile to try to limit\nemissions. A world with 1.5 Celsius degrees of warming means less suffering\nand damage than one at 1.6 degrees, which is less than at 1.7 degrees.\nReducing or eliminating emissions will limit warming and make the resultant\nclimate instability easier to address. If we want to keep infrastructural\nsystems functioning in a world of anthropogenic climate change, mitigation is\nkey. Limiting the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means that we can\nbegin to stabilize the climate and give ourselves more breathing space to\nrespond, rather than locking ourselves into an exponentially worsening\nsituation. It’s like having an overflowing bathtub: yes, you absolutely need\nto start mopping up the floor to keep the water from getting into the walls\nand causing permanent damage, but your first priority always has to be turning\noff the faucet.\n\nTransitioning all of our infrastructural systems away from combustion is a\ntransformative undertaking. It means replacing and rebuilding systems at all\nscales, from the domestic to the global, everything from backyard grills to\ncontainer ships. It’s daunting, but we can incorporate everything we’ve\nlearned over the past century and a half about how these systems function and\nuse all the new technologies that have become available. Our responses to\nclimate change don’t have to be purely reactive, focused on averting\ncatastrophe. Instead, we can act on the opportunity to build a sustainable\nfuture of thriving human communities embedded in healthy environments.\n\nIf infrastructure is the biggest lever we have to mitigate and respond to\nclimate change, it’s also a lever that none of us can move alone.\nInfrastructural systems are collective ways of providing us with individual\nagency, and this works in the other direction too—our individual energy usage,\nand thus our individual emissions, largely result from these shared systems,\nwhich serve hundreds, thousands, or even millions of other people and\nhouseholds. Infrastructural systems lock in efficiencies—of energy, but also\nmoney and time—through networks and standards, and that means they also lock\nin specific ways of doing things, making them harder to do in other ways.\nThat’s what makes it possible for us not to have to think about them, but it’s\nalso what makes it challenging—often prohibitively so—to act in ways that\naren’t the ones supported by these systems, like not driving a car in a city\nwith limited public transit options. What’s worse, we know that making a\npersonal decision, like deciding to leave the car at home or replace the gas\nfurnace in our house with a heat pump, doesn’t necessarily help anyone else\nmake the same decision, and because these are collective systems, our\nindividual contribution is minuscule. Many of us have come to the\ndisheartening conclusion that, no matter how great our individual sacrifice of\ntime, money, or energy, no matter how much we radically change our own lives\nand homes in order to reduce our personal emissions, we can’t move the needle\nalone.\n\n## The Limits of Individual Action\n\nEvery member of my immediate family lives on the other side of a national\nborder, or an ocean away, or a continent away. As an academic, I’ve lived,\nworked, and traveled around the world, with friends and colleagues and\ncollaborators in many countries. Air travel in the U.S. is relatively\ninexpensive, and flying has been important to me for my entire life,\npersonally and professionally, starting with those flights I took with my\nfamily when I was too young to even remember them. If I think about greenhouse\ngas emissions from an individual perspective, I know that flights are going to\nbe a big contributor for me. How big, exactly? To find out, I started at the\nCarbon Footprint website, which has a calculator to figure out your emissions\nfootprint so you can purchase the appropriate carbon offsets in order to be a\nnet zero producer of greenhouse gases.\n\nFor the last decade or so, I’ve driven a car with a conventional gas engine\nthat is compact and reasonably fuel efficient, a 2013 Mazda3 hatchback. I\nplugged its make and model into the emissions calculator, ballparking my total\nannual mileage as twelve thousand miles, about average for American drivers.\nThe calculator spits out that my car produces about 3.12 metric tons of carbon\ndioxide each year. Easy.\n\nI have family in Los Angeles—my brother, sister-in-law, and my beloved young\nniece and nephew. What are the greenhouse gas emissions associated with flying\nout to visit them? I enter the Boston and Los Angeles airport codes, choose\n“economy” (business and first-class passengers, because there are fewer\npassengers in the same space, are effectively responsible for a higher\nproportion of emissions). I specify a return trip, since I’ll come back to\nBoston after my always-too-short visit. Finally, I click on a checkbox next to\nthe option to include radiative forcing, to account for the way that\ncombustion products from jet planes have a disproportionate effect on global\nwarming because they’re released high in the atmosphere. The calculator\nestimates my effective emissions from a flight out to Los Angeles and then\nhome again: 1.17 metric tons of CO2. That _one_ cross-country trip—one visit\nwith my niece and nephew—produces over a third of the emissions that my car\ndoes. It’s the equivalent of four months of driving back and forth to work,\nrunning errands, driving out of the city to visit friends, everything that I\ndo in my car. To be fair, a coast-to-coast return trip is also more than five\nthousand miles, nearly half of my annual driving mileage. Jet planes go\nthrough a lot of fuel, but those emissions are shared by everyone on board,\nand so the emissions per-passenger-mile are slightly lower than when I’m alone\nin my car. Yet even with a daily driving commute, most of my personal\ncontribution still comes from flying. It only takes a couple of flights to LA\nand one or two home to see my parents and my sister’s family, outside Toronto,\nfor me to double my personal carbon footprint, and that’s just for my\nfamily—never mind seeing my friends or work-related travel.\n\nIt’s certainly possible for me to cut air travel out of my life, which would\nsignificantly reduce my individual carbon footprint, if at the price of only\nrarely getting to spend time with many of the people I love. But here’s the\nthing: even if I did stop flying, if _everyone_ stopped flying, it’s not going\nto make much of a difference. It turns out that all air travel in total only\naccounts for a few percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. The contribution\nof civil aviation is dwarfed by ground transportation and power generation.\nThis is a perfect example of why making individual changes feels so\ndemoralizing: if I decided to radically reduce my personal carbon footprint by\nnever flying, at tremendous personal cost, it wouldn’t change anything else in\nany appreciable way.\n\nWe now know this empirically, because many of us were part of a global natural\nexperiment on the effect we can have on climate change by dramatically\ncurtailing our personal mobility. In March 2020, the World Health Organization\ndeclared a global pandemic, and within days Massachusetts and much of the rest\nof the country—and a large proportion of the world—had a crash-stop of almost\nall voluntary, individual use of transportation. I drove so little over the\nfollowing few months that my car’s brake pads rusted out and needed to be\nreplaced, and my mechanic told me that they’d seen many cars like mine. Closed\nborders, travel restrictions, and mandatory quarantine periods put an end to\nall but the most necessary air travel. I didn’t get on a plane again until\nJune 2021—by far the longest stretch in my adult life that I didn’t fly. For\nover a year, the two biggest contributors to my individual greenhouse gas\nemissions were almost entirely eliminated. I radically reduced my personal\ncarbon footprint, just like I was supposed to. So did millions of other\npeople.\n\nThe economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic was enormous, but the personal,\nsocial, and emotional toll that it took on human connections continues to be\nincalculable. All the people who didn’t get to be with their loved ones for a\nyear or more, or when they were ill or dying, or ever again. It was the most\ncatastrophic and traumatizing way imaginable of reducing our level of agency\naround mobility and transportation, but it did have an effect: greenhouse gas\nemissions in the U.S. dropped sharply in 2020, by around 10 percent. All of\nthose hugely changed behaviors, and the total effect was only about ten\npercent. Globally, the drop was even smaller, about 5 percent. And that\ndecline didn’t last. After rebounding in 2021, global emissions are back to\ntheir pre-pandemic trajectory.\n\nWhat this showed us, powerfully, is that individual, voluntary actions aren’t\nthe main driver of our collective greenhouse gas emissions. Most of our total\nenergy usage, and therefore the bulk of our emissions, is\ncollective—industrial usage, food production, energy generation, and goods\ntransportation. None of these are tractable to individual decisions about\nreducing our carbon footprint.\n\nSo where did the idea come from, and why is it so powerful? The genesis of the\n“carbon footprint” was an early 2000s advertising campaign for British\nPetroleum. Rather than making carbon emissions the responsibility of oil\nproducers, or even regulators, this rhetorical move shifted responsibility to\nconsumers—to individuals, in other words. After all, what responsible, moral\nperson who cares about the planet and wants to do something about climate\nchange _wouldn’t_ want to reduce their emissions? But it’s impossible to\ncreate deep or sustained reductions in emissions by changing our behaviors if\nwe’re not also changing the systems themselves. Which means that we, the\nconsumers of energy, are being set up to fail and to feel bad about not being\nable to solve something that we can’t possibly solve on our own. Worse, we’re\nbeing set up to make _others_ feel bad about not making “better choices.” Our\ninability to solve the problem as individuals corrodes our belief that\nreducing emissions is even possible, and our motivation for trying: “What\ndifference does it make if I fly less if everyone else is still going to\nconferences and off on vacation? And anyways, it’s all a rounding error\ncompared to cars and trucks.” Or it corrodes our solidarity with others: “I’m\ndoing my part and making a sacrifice, why aren’t they?” It’s a stellar example\nof the truism that what all advertising sells, regardless of the product on\noffer, is insecurity and discontent.\n\nA “carbon footprint” implicitly conflates energy usage with using—that is,\n_buying_ —fossil fuels, which means that reducing our individual carbon\nfootprint requires reducing our _energy_ footprint, which also means less of\neverything we could do with that energy. Conversely, if we want to continue\nbenefiting from energy, or if we want those benefits to be extended to more\npeople, that means burning more fossil fuels, even if it means a higher carbon\nfootprint. Formulating it as an equivalence makes it very clear why oil\ncompanies would pay ad agencies to promote the idea of carbon footprints.\nCementing the relationship between petroleum products, energy, and freedom is\na good way to ensure continued demand for your product.\n\nIt’s also a misdirection. A higher energy footprint only means a higher\nemissions footprint if that energy comes from combustion. But if it doesn’t—if\nwe power our infrastructural systems, particularly the electrical grid and\ntransportation—with energy that _doesn’t_ come from fossil fuels, we can\ndecouple our energy footprint and our carbon footprint. We couldn’t have done\nthis a generation ago. Back then, the only way to reduce emissions was to\nreduce energy usage, either directly or through increased efficiency (like how\nLED lightbulbs use much less energy to produce the same amount of light as\nincandescent bulbs). What’s changed is the development and commodification of\nenergy alternatives like solar power, wind turbines, and grid-scale storage,\nall of which augment “traditional” sources of renewable energy, including\nhydroelectricity and nuclear power. Renewable energy is now where electricity\nitself was a century and a half ago: the technologies are still somewhat\nemergent, with some unresolved questions, and they’re still only a small part\nof energy systems. But the writing is on the wall: it’s now just about\npossible to create infrastructural systems that are fully powered by\nsustainable and renewable energy, ones that produce and are powered by the\nsame amount of energy, or even more, as their petroleum-burning predecessors,\nbut without the associated atmospheric pollution.\n\nThis possibility allows us to see a future where we don’t have to choose\nbetween a stable climate and all the agency and opportunity that\ninfrastructural systems provide. We can rebuild infrastructural systems to\nmake them not just resilient but sustainable, to do more with them rather than\nless. We have the unprecedented opportunity to extend these systems, and\neverything that they enable, to more people and communities. But we can only\ndo it if we act collectively. It means shifting from the mindset of\nindividuals acting inside, or even in direct opposition to, our collective\nsystems, and instead acting together to transform them.\n\n## Toward an Energy Transformation\n\nYear-over-year total electricity usage is fairly steady in the more\nindustrially developed (OECD) countries—the demand is effectively saturated,\nin that residents of these countries might do different things with the power\nbut it doesn’t change aggregate electricity consumption by much. That’s also\nbeen approximately true of energy usage broadly: increased wealth across a\npopulation leads to increased energy consumption, but only to a point. That\nflattening of the energy curve is also a result of a consistent, sustained\neffort to do more with less, including through policy and regulation like\nwidespread efficiency standards, which cancel out increases due to economic\ngrowth. In non-OECD countries, the total electricity (and energy) consumption\nis growing as more and more people get access to electricity and the\nopportunity and resources to use it, and this growth is still largely fueled\nby fossil fuels with an associated increase in emissions. Reducing energy\nusage by doing less—not being with our friends and family, or otherwise\nreducing activities to use less power—is a tough sell. But to ask communities\nworldwide—both in the Global South and in underserved communities in otherwise\nwealthy, developed countries—to limit _their_ energy usage, communities that\nmay never have had access to these systems and the lives they enable, would be\ninequitable, bordering on unconscionable.\n\nOur infrastructural networks, as designed, funnel resources to a fraction of\nhumanity to allow them—and I’m part of this group, so I need to say “us”—to\nlive lives of comfort and agency. They’re the most powerful means that\nhumanity has ever devised to take care of each other at scale, to use energy\nand resources collectively. These systems are how we reduce the quotidian\nstruggle to be a human, to have a material human body with material needs in a\nmaterial world. In a more equitable world, more people, globally, would have\naccess to the benefits provided by shared infrastructural systems. But that\nalso means taking a hard look at the inequitable distribution of the\nassociated harms, and figuring out how to limit rather than displace them.\n\nInfrastructural networks are also among our most powerful tools for facing\nclimate change. We need them to both prepare for and respond to the growing\nimpacts of a rapidly and unpredictably changing climate. The impact of crises\nlike natural disasters and extreme weather events is entirely mediated by\nhumans—who’s in harm’s way, what resources they have available, and the scale\nand effectiveness of the response. The tools that we use to respond require\naccess to energy, materials, information, and the networks we use to move them\nall around—in other words, infrastructure.\n\nAt the same time, many infrastructural systems, as currently conceived and\nbuilt, are just not going to work well anymore. Whether it’s drawing down\naquifers or using up fossil fuels while pumping carbon dioxide in the air,\nthey rely on resources and processes that might not be viable a decade from\nnow, much less a century, much less in perpetuity. They are, in the most\nliteral sense, not sustainable. On top of that, these networks were built\npresupposing a climate that is already disappearing; and we don’t really know\nfor sure what it will change to, other than being much more variable and\nextreme. Even if all we care about is that the currently extant\ninfrastructural networks—again, I have to use the first-person plural here,\nour networks—continue to function well enough that we don’t have to think\nabout them, we can no longer ignore their close relationship with\nanthropogenic climate change. Not the way they contribute to it because\nthey’re powered by fossil fuels, and not the way that being embedded in the\nlandscape makes them unavoidably vulnerable.\n\nWhere does this leave us? For most of the two centuries that we’ve had modern\ninfrastructure—infrastructural systems that use exogenous energy, mostly in\nthe form of fossil fuel combustion—it was built to be functional and robust.\nBut to remain functional, infrastructure needs to be resilient in an\nenvironment whose stability can no longer be taken for granted. Resilience\nrequires sustainability, particularly environmental sustainability, the\nability to continue processes into the future. Sustainable and resilient\ninfrastructure is inherently more equitable, because sustainable energy and\nprocesses limit harms compared to unsustainable processes, and resilient\ninfrastructure provides ongoing benefits. Equitable infrastructure means\nmaking high-quality and appropriate systems available to more people and\ncommunities, and those systems too need to be resilient and sustainable. There\nare no infrastructural systems, on any scale, that can be functional without\nalso being sustainable, resilient, and equitable. These four characteristics\nare essentially inextricable from each other.\n\nFor communities, countries, and regions that already have full-stack\ninfrastructural networks, an important starting point is decarbonizing these\nsystems. But if that means rebuilding them in their entirety, it’s also an\nopportunity to do things differently. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy\nsources are, by their nature, distributed and decentralized. In the twentieth\ncentury, infrastructural facilities moved farther and farther from where they\nwere used as a way of displacing the harms, like the way that coal-powered\nelectricity plants were once in neighborhoods out of cities, but now power\nplants are mostly outside cities, having gotten much larger in the process.\nWith fewer negative effects on those around them, energy production can\npotentially return to the neighborhoods they serve. Community microgrids that\nrun on locally available wind or solar or geothermal power and that\nincorporate storage are resilient as well as sustainable, inherently resistant\nto disruptions to the electrical grid or to supply chains for fuel.\n\nBut full decarbonization requires an entire technological transformation: the\nreplacement of every device, machine, and facility that runs on combustion\nwith an alternative that uses electricity. This has significant implications\nfor materials: Where are all the raw materials going to come from? What about\nthe energy to fabricate them? But also: If we’re now thinking about replacing\neverything anyway, do we really want to do it the same way? Do we replace\nevery gasoline-powered car with an electric car, or do we build out more\npublic transit? Do we replace every natural gas–burning furnace with an\nelectric heater, or can we build out neighborhood geothermal grids?\nTransforming existing infrastructural systems is like being faced with a\nGordian knot but instead of just severing it with a sword, we’re figuring out\nhow to untangle it and then how to knit the cord together in a whole new way.\n\nGrowing out new systems has a different set of challenges but also a\nremarkable set of opportunities. Developing countries have the opportunity to\nleapfrog Global North–style infrastructural networks—the top-down, resource-\nextracting, CO2-emitting systems—and instead build out sustainable, local,\nappropriate alternatives, paralleling the way that many regions skipped over\nlandlines and went straight to mobile phones. Helping resources get into the\nhands of communities via infrastructural networks is especially important\nbecause the places that will bear the brunt of climate disruption are the ones\nwith the fewest resources to respond. And renewable energy is _intrinsically_\ncheaper than fossil fuels. Both have capital costs to build out as well as\nrunning costs, but renewables don’t have incremental costs, where every joule\nof output has to be paid for, because the raw energy input—sunlight, wind,\nrunning water, the heat of the earth—doesn’t require making a payment to an\noil company.\n\nFor all their limitations and the inequality baked into them, our\ninfrastructural systems remain an important means to reduce human suffering\nand to increase agency. It is absolutely possible to create systems that are\nfunctional, resilient, sustainable, and equitable, on a global scale. The\nchallenge is figuring out how to get from here to there, technologically and\nsocially.\n\n## Black Start\n\nAt the very end of our tour of Electric Mountain, our minibus reemerged into\nthe cool gray of a summer day in Wales to skirt the lower reservoir and return\nto the village at the foot of Mount Snowdon where we began. En route, we\npassed an unassuming building that blended perfectly into the surrounding\nlandscape of green hills. It was perhaps two stories high, with a steeply\npitched roof, faced in the same local slate as the picturesque ruins of\nDolbadarn Castle across the lake.\n\nInside the building is an emergency power system: diesel generators with their\nfuel supplies, connected to a bank of storage batteries. In the event of a\ncomplete systems failure—a blackout across the entire island of Great\nBritain—it can provide enough electricity to open the valves at Dinorwig,\nreleasing water from the upper reservoir to fall onto the spinning turbines,\npowering up the station and sending the electricity out to the national grid\nto bring other systems back online in turn. It’s called a “black start.”\n\nFor humanity, fossil fuels like coal and crude oil were our black start,\nliterally and figuratively. They were conveniently stockpiled underground,\neasy to access, easy to move around, and easy to use; after all, people have\nbeen creating energy by combustion since before we were even _Homo sapiens_.\nFossil fuels lifted us out of darkness, literally and metaphorically, giving\nus the time and resources to create our global, connected, highly cooperative,\ntechnological civilization. But above all, fossil fuels created the conditions\nfor humanity to invent the renewable energy technologies that will supplant\nthem. Like the diesel generators at Dinorwig, fossil fuels are a transition\nphase, not something we want to or even _can_ rely on indefinitely. Our\ncivilization is up and running, and now it’s time to throw the switch that\ntakes us from the pollution and inefficiency of our black start and powers up\na future of sustainable energy and everything that it makes possible.\n\n\n# Nine\n\n# An Emerging Future of Infrastructure\n\nStanding in tropical sunlight on a January morning, I had a new appreciation\nof why it’s called a solar _farm_. At higher latitudes, solar panels are often\nmechanized in order to track the sun but here, at the SolarArise power plant\njust outside of Hyderabad, India, and well south of the Tropic of Cancer, the\nperson-high panels were just tilted like the gnomons of sundials, each set\nfacing the sun at the same angle, planted in neat rows, and surrounded by\ngrassy meadow.\n\nI was being shown around by Prashanth Reddy, the site engineer. Prashanth’s\nparents lived nearby, and he had starting working at the facility right after\nhe graduated from a local engineering school. I asked him what he liked most\nabout his job and he said it was the combination of problem-solving and\nspending time outside every day. Much of the work of the plant seemed to be\nthe kind of quiet routine maintenance familiar to utilities workers around the\nworld. Here, that included daily washing of the panels, on a rotating schedule\nso that any given pane of silicon was cleaned every month or so. I could see\nhow the just-cleaned row shone beside its dusty neighbor that was next up to\nbe washed. Inside a control room, two staffers kept watch for unexpected power\ndrops that would reveal a technical hitch. The entire system is built out of\nrepeating modular units, which makes it easy to narrow down the location and\nnature of a problem and to swap in new parts. In fact, the whole facility is\nmade up of two identical plants in parallel, built one at a time, first\nTelangana I and then Telangana II (named after the Indian state we were in).\nThe complex includes shipping-container-sized outbuildings and the\ntransformers that send the output from both carbon-copied halves of the\nfacility onward, via the power cables that I had seen along the road as we\ndrove in, to a substation in the nearby village and then into the electrical\ngrid. The fence around the transformers had signs warning of site-specific\nhazards. One had a skull and crossbones and the words danger 33kv, followed by\nthe same warning in _seven_ other languages and scripts—Hindi, Urdu, Telugu,\nPunjabi, Kannada, Malayalam, and Tamil. The text on the other sign was only in\nEnglish, but the danger it warned against was quite a bit less abstract and a\npictogram of two wriggling snakes conveyed it clearly. I started to watch\nwhere I set my feet.\n\nAs we walked, I listened as Prashanth explained that the silicon photovoltaic\npanels don’t last forever. They degrade slowly and predictably over a span of\nyears, gradually producing less and less electricity, so their power output is\ntracked and used to create a schedule to swap in replacements before the\nefficiency drops below a predetermined threshold. This careful planning can be\nthrown off by tall grass. Not only does it block the sunlight, lowering the\noutput, but the shadows of the growing, swaying vegetation can turn that\nsteady, even decline of the panels into one that’s a lot more random. The\nsolution to this problem was low-tech—the facility contracts with local\nfarmers who come in and cut the grass regularly, keeping the trimmings as\nfodder for their livestock.\n\nIt felt idyllic to be wandering between solar panels in a field out in the\ncountry, everything around me peaceful and just silently functioning. When I\nleft New Delhi that winter morning, it had been dark, freezing, and smoke-\nsaturated, but here the day was warm enough that I had shed first my coat, and\nthen my scarf and sweater, and was now down to a black T-shirt, absorbing\nsolar radiation and turning it directly into warmth on my skin. I remembered\nthe old joke and I shared it with Prashanth: What happens when there’s a fuel\nspill at a solar power plant? It’s a sunny day.\n\nIt didn’t feel like the future. It felt like the present.\n\n## The Narrowest Future\n\nPostapocalyptic futures are a staple of science fiction, and almost by\ndefinition those futures don’t have well-functioning infrastructural systems.\nIn popular books, film, and TV, there are hardly any positive, utopian visions\nof the future where everyone’s needs are met by largely invisible systems. If\nthere is a society like this, the action usually takes place at the periphery,\nlike Starfleet in _Star Trek_ , or it’s only for a small elite, resulting in\nconflict between the utopian haves and the dystopian masses of have-nots, as\nin _The Hunger Games_.\n\nI often joke that the only science-fictional future that I personally want to\nlive in is the one where everyone lives a life that is long, cared for, and\nwell provisioned, so that the worst thing that could happen to you before your\npeaceful death is heartbreak. Those stories don’t exactly lend themselves to\nexciting, big-budget, CGI-loaded movies. One consequence of their absence from\nfictional narratives is that most of us don’t have a lot of practice thinking\nabout the shared futures that we _do_ want to live in. I’m comfortably middle-\naged and in good health; barring death by misadventure, that means I can\nreasonably expect to see the middle of the twenty-first century. But any\nestimate of my life expectancy presupposes that I’ll have continued access to\nthe kinds of infrastructure I do today, in an urban area of the American\nNortheast, like clean water and adequate sanitation, adequate heat and cooling\nand reliable energy, to say nothing about the health care and other systems\nthey enable, or the supply chains and food systems we depend on. Access to\nthese systems contributes to the variation in life expectancy by where you\nlive, and it’s also why excess death rates rise sharply when these systems\nfail, as during long-term power outages.\n\nWhat if all I cared about was my _personal_ access? What would it take to keep\nthe infrastructural systems that I rely on functioning throughout the next\nfour or so decades of my own lifetime, so that my future continues to resemble\nmy privileged present? A fair bit of work, it turns out. These systems were\nmostly built to be robust and redundant, but they’ll also need to be resilient\nand responsive so that they can continue to function as the effects of climate\nchange become more and more apparent.\n\nBy 2050, the mid-twentieth-century building boom in the U.S., Canada, and\nother places will be a century in the rearview mirror, and entropy will have\nbeen taking its toll that whole time. So the obvious place to start is to\nbuttress existing infrastructural systems, starting with finally doing all the\nmaintenance that’s needed to bring them back into good repair. That would mean\nsystematically and swiftly replacing leaky century-old water pipes, bringing\naging bridges back up to structural snuff, going through the daunting and\nmultivarious repair backlogs of transit and transportation systems of all\nsorts—everything that’s been pulling down the grades on ASCE’s national\ninfrastructure report card. And not just locally, because my life isn’t\nrestricted just to New England and neither are these systems.\n\nBut we already know that routine maintenance alone won’t be enough to get us\nto the middle of the century. Keeping these systems functional means starting\nto deal with the threats that are already here, including greater variability\nin the weather. It means winterizing the electrical grid in places where the\nweather is getting unexpectedly cold, like Texas, and it means upgrading\nmaintenance and tree-trimming schedules and installing equipment to reduce the\nrisk of fire from energized power lines in places that are becoming\nincreasingly hot, not just California but the entire West Coast, at least as\nfar north as Vancouver. It means planning for heavy rain and building\nstrategies for flood mitigation from New York City subways to dams across the\nrural Midwest. It also likely means _unbuilding_ structures, whether that’s\nrelocating buildings away from shorelines facing sea-level rise and higher\nstorm surges, or taking up the concrete around urban rivers and replacing it\nwith bioswales, vegetated channels that absorb stormwater, preventing floods\nwhile removing pollutants. It means upgrading water supplies to manage\nemerging classes of contaminants, like PFAS, and it means hardening the\nelectrical grid continent-wide so it can weather the next Carrington\nEvent–level solar storm.\n\nAll of this is just the absolute minimum to maintain the status quo for\nanother few decades, and much of this work is already happening. But even with\nthis narrow perspective, there are obvious concerns. First, no matter how\nshort our time horizon, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to just blindly invest\nin rebuilding systems without considering whether they’re the systems we want\nto have, potentially for decades to come. If you’re digging up and replacing\nleaky water mains, it’s a good time to think about separating out stormwater\nand sanitary sewage so that wastewater treatment plants aren’t overwhelmed\nevery time it rains. Repairing roads and other transportation routes? It’s an\nopportunity to address congestion, parking and land use, and traffic safety,\nwhich means considering alternatives to private vehicles. As always,\nmaintenance shades into renewal and rebuilding and replacement. But also,\nthere’s no way to maintain a status quo when the world is changing around it.\nRoutine challenges, like bad weather, are starting to become anything but\nroutine, as climate instability leads to increasingly extreme weather events.\nBut it’s not the weather events that are the natural disasters. A blizzard in\nMontreal is par for the course; the same blizzard in Atlanta is a different\nstory. What makes a natural disaster is a severe adverse impact on a community\nand its infrastructure, and the more vulnerable they are—both the people and\nthe systems—the more severe the impact. But this also means that this impact\ncan be lessened by creating resilient infrastructure, including the social\nsystems around it. Planning and building for the next half century of climate\nchange means planning to mitigate natural disasters.\n\n## Reliability and Risk\n\nThe ferry is my favorite way across the San Francisco Bay, but it’s also\ncrossed by a number of bridges and the Transbay Tunnel that carries the BART\ntrains. In the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which was strong\nenough that the Bay Bridge was seriously damaged, that redundancy in the\nregional transportation network meant that ferries could bring people in and\nout of San Francisco during repairs to the bridge. Redundant networks with\nmultiple paths are intrinsically resilient. Conversely, where the network\nredundancy is low, the system as a whole becomes brittle. This is what’s\ndifferent about snow days on the eastern and western ends of Interstate 90. A\ntraffic accident on the highway in Boston, where it’s embedded in a web of\nsurface roads, is a minor inconvenience. In Snoqualmie Pass, through the\nmountains just east of Seattle, shutting down a lane or more of the highway\nmeans a major disruption to travel in and out of the city. This is also one of\nthe fundamental design principles of the Internet, with its decentralized\nstructure and network protocols that allow for routing around damaged nodes. A\nsimilar network redundancy in the electrical grid is why power could be routed\naround the damaged Metcalfe substation after it was attacked, avoiding major\noutages.\n\nWhen there’s a single or just a few points of failure, they need to be\nreliable, not just in the face of routine challenges but also under\nextraordinary conditions. That high reliability can be achieved by a\ncombination of making facilities robust and incorporating redundancy, like the\ntriplicate systems of my local water treatment plant. But in a world of\nclimate instability, we’re already beginning to see that might not be enough.\nFaced with conditions that are challenging and unpredictable, systems need to\nbe resilient. A brittle system is one that “falls over,” failing all at once.\nResilient systems can remain largely functional even if some individual\nelements fail, or else can recover their functionality quickly after failure.\n\nResilience is strengthened by redundancy and also by diversity, incorporating\ndifferent _kinds_ of elements. It’s why scheduled service for a ferry fleet on\nthe San Francisco Bay can be an aspect of disaster resilience in addition to\nbeing a daily commute. In the case of an earthquake severe enough to damage\nbridges and tunnels, an alternate transportation mode across the bay would be\ncritical, especially in the crucial first hours and days of disaster response.\nResilience is also strengthened by decentralization, with smaller, distributed\nfacilities rather than just a few large ones, however robust. Here’s where\nrenewable energy has the potential to really shine, because the energy inputs\n(water, wind, sun, geothermal) are distributed by their nature, unlike fossil\nfuels. Local electricity generation can be coupled with local energy storage,\nlike batteries, configured as a community-level microgrid, and connected to\nthe main electrical grid. Whether there’s a severe and widespread event like a\nhurricane or a small-scale issue like a substation failure, the microgrid\ncould continue to provide power even if the connection to the larger grid goes\ndown, and it’s not dependent on fuel deliveries or other supply chains. And\nunlike diesel generators, having a community-scale microgrid means that\neveryone is already connected to their neighbors and can easily share\nemergency power. Mutual aid for disaster response is built into the system\nitself. In cities, where residents mostly use electricity brought in from\ngenerating sources elsewhere, one starting point is “resilience hubs” that can\nprovide power just in emergencies. Electricity cooperatives in rural areas,\nwhich already have local distribution networks in place, are leading the\ntransition to renewably powered, resilient microgrids.\n\nWhat’s common to all of these approaches—robustness, redundancy, and\nresilience, especially through diversity and decentralization—is that they are\nnot efficient. Making systems resilient is fundamentally at odds with\noptimization, because optimizing a system means taking out any slack. A truly\noptimized, and thus efficient, system is only possible with near-perfect\nknowledge about the system, together with the ability to observe and implement\na response. For a system to be reliable, on the other hand, there have to be\nsome unused resources to draw on when the unexpected happens, which, well,\nhappens predictably. This is what safety factors in the design of bridges and\nother structures are for: they are “overbuilt” (in careful, specific ways) to\ncompensate for uncertainties that can’t be eliminated entirely. Electrical\ngrids have significantly more power on tap than the predicted demand. In fact,\nhaving a reserve is often required by regulators to help make sure that the\ngrid is reliable. Winterizing an electrical grid is about expanding the\ntemperature range in which it functions well, but on most days, that\nwinterization isn’t needed. The same is true of retrofitting systems, like\nrail and power lines, so that they continue to function well at the hottest\ntemperatures. Redundancy is a form of slack; passenger jets have multiple\nengines so that they can still fly safely if one fails. Sometimes the slack is\nin the form of a buffer, a supply of whatever is being moved around. A battery\nis a buffer, and so is a reservoir that holds water until it’s needed for\nirrigation or power generation.\n\nSometimes that slack is provided by people. An overbooked flight is one that’s\nbeen overoptimized, and so when a gate agent asks for volunteers to give up\ntheir seat in favor of a later one, it’s a way of finding some human slack in\nthe system. The widespread use of real-time traffic mapping services has\nbecome a source of slack—of flexibility or resilience—for roads, as drivers\nuse that information to disperse out along different routes. But most of the\ntime, when infrastructural systems fail, humans are not so much providing\nslack as they are dealing with the consequences and paying the price. A\nblackout might shut down a factory, but a five-day blackout during a winter\nfreeze in Texas shuts down _everything_ —the bodies and lives of the residents\nserve as the buffers and the reservoirs and the source of resilience. When a\nmunicipal water supply is temporarily unsafe to drink, that means that someone\nis spending part of their day boiling and cooling drinking water or getting\nbottled water to drink and for hygiene. When it’s unsafe to drink\nindefinitely, this work goes on indefinitely.\n\nOptimizing a system means having some metric for what it means to run well, as\nwell as a predictable context—what it’s being optimized for, and under what\nconditions. A plane that’s completely full of passengers is optimized for\ncost—in principle, it should maximize revenue generation for the airline, or\nminimize ticket price for the customer, or both. But if a thunderstorm grounds\nthe plane, that means that this optimized system has now become a plane full\nof people who don’t have a way to get home, especially if all the later\nflights are also similarly “optimized,” with few empty seats. Because\ninfrastructural systems are mostly about nonmonetary benefits to people—their\ntime, agency, comfort, and health—optimizing them for price, much less revenue\nand profit, misses these important aspects. Systems can only be optimized for\nwhat they measure—the cost of providing electricity can be accounted for, but\nmissing from that accounting is what it means to spend a day huddled under\nblankets because the heating is out during a winter freeze—and only under\npredictable conditions. Climate instability means more uncertainty in the\nlarger context of infrastructural systems. As the environment in which they’re\nembedded becomes more variable, that means _de_ -optimizing these systems. It\nmeans investing in making them reliable under a wider and less predictable\nrange of conditions and putting in the safeguards necessary to prevent outlier\nevents from becoming natural disasters, where the highest human costs are paid\nby the most vulnerable. If the twentieth century was about building\ninfrastructural systems that could manage or even just displace risks, the\ntwenty-first century is going to be about building out systems—human as well\nas technological—that are resilient enough to sustain our communities during\nconditions of ongoing uncertainty.\n\n## Responsiveness and Adaptability\n\nI was born after most of the systems that I talk about in this book were first\nbuilt out in the places where I’ve spent most of my life: municipal water\nprovision and wastewater treatment, a continent-wide electricity grid, the\ntelephone system, public transit systems, utility gas distribution in cities,\nthe highway system, civil aviation, and containerization. The one big change\nhas been telecommunications, with the rise of the Internet and of mobile\ntelephony; even then, much of the domestic-scale physical networks, like phone\nlines and telephone cables, were installed in residences long before they\nbecame repurposed to provide Internet access. Many of the systems that I use\ntoday were built out using a top-down, technocratic mindset that imposed them\non communities that had little say in where they would go, how they would be\nused, and by whom. It’s highways through African American neighborhoods and\nreservoirs that drowned ancestral hunting grounds. It’s also huge centralized\nsystems like the Deer Island treatment plant or the Pickering Nuclear\nGenerating Station.\n\nThis approach arose from a certain epistemological stance: the planners and\nengineers who were designing and building out infrastructural systems believed\nthat they knew what to do and how to do it, and that it was the right thing to\nbe doing. Centralization and robustness—designing for scale and\nlongevity—follow from this. Even at the time they were built, those beliefs\nwere challenged—that’s why there’s a subway line and a linear park heading\nsoutheast out of Boston instead of an expressway—but now, half a century or\nmore later, we have a very different perspective on the decisions that were\nmade and the tradeoffs and biases that were built in. What’s more, in a world\nwith a rapidly changing environmental and technical context—climate\ninstability and the rapid development of new technologies, particularly in\nenergy generation and storage—it doesn’t make sense to make big, irreversible\ninvestments. Since we don’t yet know exactly what we’re going to need or how\nit’ll work, what makes more sense is smaller-scale, distributed, reversible\nsystems. It’s a counterintuitive way to think about systems that are\ncharacterized by continuity, but in order to keep functioning in a changing\nworld, these systems will need to change with time—to be _responsive_. More\nresponsive infrastructure, systems that incorporate diversity and\ndecentralization, can also be more resilient. And a more provisional, adaptive\napproach to building out infrastructure, one that involves exploration,\nexperimentation, and prototyping, provides pathways to getting community\ninput, seeing how new facilities and systems work, and then modifying them\ninto something different.\n\nSome of this responsiveness was in evidence in cities during the first year of\nthe coronavirus pandemic. I had bought a bike and had started riding around\ntown not long before the public health crisis began, prompted by the way my\nneighborhood was steadily getting more bike-friendly, including the\ninstallation of bike racks and repair stands. When I was biking home from the\nlibrary where I often worked, my commute would take me across a bridge that\ngoes from a busy street in Boston onto one in Cambridge that’s nearly as busy,\nbut instead of dodging cars, I’d find myself in a protected bike lane,\ncomplete with bright green road markings. Crossing over the river on my bike\nalways feels like being in the kind of fantasy novel where the heroes face\nenemy resistance on their journey but magic-eased passage across their own\nkingdom.\n\nBut what was really striking was how much new cycling infrastructure was put\nin place during the pandemic and how fast it went up, as the built environment\nrapidly became the “build it as you need it” environment. On both sides of the\nCharles River, there were new, temporary bike lanes, often initially marked\noff only with large orange and black safety barrels and temporary signage.\nBusy commercial streets saw traffic lanes repurposed, not only for bike lanes\nbut as “slow streets,” as pedestrian thoroughfares, or to create extra-wide\npatios for outdoor seating. Over the course of the pandemic and the turning\nseasons, those patios were first augmented with heaters, and then the tables\nand chairs were put into storage as winter arrived in earnest before being\nbrought out again in the spring. The coronavirus pandemic provided both a need\nfor and an opportunity to experiment with different ways of using city\nstreets, allowing the community to “try out” temporary responses before they\nbecame permanent changes to the local landscape. Urban transportation\nactivists have long advocated similarly experimental and responsive strategies\nwith bus routing, taking advantage of the inherent flexibility of buses on\nroads.\n\nTemporarily modifying the way that streets are used is a pretty minor example\nof how an infrastructural system can be locally responsive to changing\nexternal circumstances. We start to see the real power of systems that are\nboth resilient and responsive, that are reliable but flexible, robust but not\nbrittle, as we start thinking about longer timescales and get further and\nfurther away from the present and our current way of doing things and into a\nworld with more unknowns.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nI don’t have children of my own, but I do have my niece and three nephews, and\nI get to be an honorary auntie to the children of many of my friends. If the\nrate of infant mortality in your community becomes low enough that you start\nexpecting that newborns will make it to adulthood, the future seems a lot\ncloser than it ever did before. That next generation is on track to see the\ntwenty-_second_ century if they live as long as their parents and\ngrandparents, but their life expectancy is just as dependent on access to\ncollective infrastructural systems as mine is. If we want those systems to\nfunction throughout their lifetimes and into the lifetimes of our\ngrandchildren, we are easily thinking about a century or longer. To be fair,\nthere are plenty of century-old infrastructural systems still in use today,\nfrom municipal water supplies to telephone lines to railway stations to\npipelines. As the descendants of their creators, we still benefit from their\ninvestment, of care and expertise as much as money. But those systems were\nmostly built out under two closely related assumptions. The first is that the\nresources they were tapping—most importantly, energy in the form of fossil\nfuels, but also water, and other materials—were limitless. And the second is\nthat the planetary ecosystem is an infinitely receptive sink for waste and\npollution, capable of absorbing any amount without being altered.\n\nWe can no longer even pretend to ourselves that these assumptions are grounded\nin reality.\n\nBurning fossil fuels for the energy to power infrastructural systems has\nplanetary-scale impacts, and the total amount of carbon dioxide and other\ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere is increasing faster than it ever has in\nhuman history. Other waste from industrial-scale processes, including\nmicroplastics and “forever chemicals” in water, is also globally distributed,\nfound far from where it’s produced or used. Fossil fuels also have localized\nimpacts, from mining to fracking to pipelines to refineries and chemical\nprocessing plants. The environmental depredation at these sites of extraction\nand processing, and where the end products are incinerated or landfilled, have\nlong been considered “out of sight, out of mind,” as supply chains and\ntransportation networks have made it possible for them to be farther and\nfarther away from the point of use. The rise of global mobility and\ntelecommunications in the last fifty years has gone a long way toward erasing\nthe idea that there is an “elsewhere” or “others.” These sacrificial zones are\nno longer entirely invisible and the voices of the communities that are\naffected are finally being heard widely, in a way they’ve never been before.\nThere is still a tremendous ongoing challenge in making the connection between\nbehaviors and outcomes, much less establishing alternatives, like “right to\nrepair” regulations that make it possible to fix electronic devices and keep\nthem out of the e-waste stream. But day-to-day decision-making aside, once we\nbegin to think about what these systems might look like a century from now, we\ncan no longer plead ignorance or delude ourselves about the negative impacts\nat either the local or the planetary level. After a century or more of drawing\non resources as if they were inexhaustible, we now understand that our\ninfrastructural systems need to operate very differently. They need to be\nsustainable.\n\nI hear the word “sustainable” so often and used in so many different ways that\nI can easily lose sight of what the word actually means. Sustainability is\nfundamentally about time, which means it’s about verbs, not nouns. For\nsomething to be sustainable, the processes or practices involved can continue\nto work, in the same way, into the future. How long into the future? Well, it\ndepends on the process and its context: maybe it means a few months or a few\nyears, or a few decades or, as here, a century or more. So how do we know that\nsomething is sustainable? The short answer to this is that we don’t. But the\nshorter the timeline in front of us, the more confidence we can have about\nwhether a process is sustainable for the duration. I’m a casual runner, but I\nam reasonably sure I could go out the door and run three miles. Six miles\nwould be more of a stretch. I’ve run half-marathons and even a marathon\nbefore, but I’m not at all confident that I can run one now, certainly not\nwithout a lot more training. And maintaining even a slow jog for a hundred-\nmile ultrathon feels pretty out of reach. There’s no way of knowing something\nis sustainable on an appropriately long timescale, because there’s no place to\nstand and look back. But while we can’t know for sure that something is\nsustainable, we often can be quite sure when it’s _not_.\n\nIf one element of sustainability is time, the other element is the process\nitself—what exactly is it that we are continuing to do the same way into the\nfuture? Is it the right process to sustain? I don’t think I could run for a\nhundred miles, but I’m pretty sure I could walk a hundred miles if I had to.\nAnd I’ve never done a century ride, but if I needed to cover a hundred miles\nunder my own power, I would get on my bike. As long as I was cycling, I could\nprobably go farther with less energy than if I were on foot, but if I couldn’t\ncycle, I could still walk, and maybe even push my bike alongside, gracefully\ntransitioning from one process to a different one. I am most confident about\nmy ability to drive a hundred miles—it’s less than two hours at highway\nspeeds—but that absolutely presupposes and embeds so much more than being on\nfoot, starting with access to a highway, to my car, and to the fuel needed to\npower it, and it opens up a whole other web of externalities like air\npollution and road safety. Deciding whether something is sustainable is\ndeciding what consequences we’re willing to accept, when, and for whom.\n\nBefore we address the more complex question of what it might take for our\ninfrastructural systems to be sustainable for a century or longer, we can\nstart with the much simpler question: What systems are _not_ sustainable on\nthis timescale? That means considering whether the process itself can continue\nfor the timeline in question, and also what happens if we keep doing things in\nthe same way.\n\n## Beyond Unsustainable Systems\n\nAny infrastructural system that involves extraction of nonrenewable resources\nor dispersal of pollution is, by definition, not sustainable. The exact\ntimelines might be up for debate, but after a century or so of\nindustrialization, we possess a deep industrial, economic, societal, and\nscientific understanding that even seemingly inexhaustible resources have\nlimits, and seemingly infinite pools for dilution can be contaminated.\n\nIn the familiar water cycle, it falls to the ground in the form of rain or\nsnow, and may be used by humans for drinking or irrigation or industrial\npurposes, before eventually evaporating, condensing into clouds, and falling\nto the earth again. But not all the water we use is part of this system, at\nleast not on human timescales. Researchers from the United States Geological\nSurvey established in the 1960s that the Ogallala Aquifer, the subterranean\nsource of the water used to irrigate those circular fields across the\nmidwestern U.S., recharges so slowly that it’s functionally nonrenewable. The\ndrop in the water level has since become unignorable. It varies from place to\nplace, but in some parts of Kansas, it’s been as much as 150 feet, deep enough\nthat farmers had little choice but to abandon wells. While there’s no single\nanswer to the question of when it’s going to run out, it’s likely to be far\nsooner than our working horizon of a century.\n\nUnlike water from the Ogallala Aquifer, the unsustainable aspect of fossil\nfuels lies not only on the extraction side but on the waste products side.\nCombustion transforms coal, oil, and natural gas from hydrocarbon chains\nburied deep in the ground into carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and\nit’s the effects of that increasing concentration that are becoming untenable.\nIf terraforming is taking an uninhabitable planet like Mars and changing the\natmosphere to make an ecosystem capable of supporting life, we are instead\ntaking our perfectly habitable planet and veneriforming it, transforming our\nterrestrial home into our other planetary next-door neighbor, suffocatingly\nhot Venus. In the near term, it might be enough to focus on making existing\ninfrastructural systems more robust, even if we don’t change how they are\ndesigned and built. But on longer timescales, certainly out to a century or\nlonger, the consequences of uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions—allowing\nthem to continue to accumulate in the atmosphere—are going to affect not just\nour infrastructural systems but virtually everything else about our planetary\nbiosphere, including every living being. The continued use of fossil fuels is\nunsustainable because these are consequences that we should not be willing to\naccept.\n\nIf weather systems become increasingly chaotic and extreme, and temperature\nincreases mean that places where humans currently live become increasingly\ninimical to life, then what kind of infrastructural birthright are we leaving\nfor our descendants? If we think about infrastructure as increasing our agency\nand the number of choices available to us, then abdicating our responsibility\nto leave them a world where they can live lives of peace and stability, with\ntheir basic needs cared for, is a failure of intergenerational empathy on a\ncivilizational scale. Our current practices are unsustainable because they\n_reduce_ the choices and agency available to coming generations.\n\nIf we want any chance of having functioning infrastructural systems a century\nfrom now, we’ll need to try to stabilize—or at least keep from further\ndestabilizing—our ecosystems by limiting greenhouse gas emissions, which means\ndecarbonizing our energy sources. This is why we mostly (but not always) use\nthe terms “sustainable energy” and “renewable energy” interchangeably:\npowering our infrastructural systems with renewable energy at least has the\npotential to be sustainable for a century or longer. But reaching that goal\nmeans successfully transitioning them away from the combustion of fossil\nfuels. Is it even possible—is there enough available renewable energy to power\nthese vast systems? What technologies are needed? And there’s an even bigger\nquestion: How do we transform infrastructural systems at scale, collectively,\nwhile we are depending on them? It’s an enormous challenge, but it’s also an\nunprecedented opportunity. Not only is it a pathway to a sustainable future,\nbut that future is one of energy abundance, not scarcity.\n\n## An Energy Accounting\n\nWhat would it take for every human on the planet to use about the same amount\nof energy as I do, in my warm, well-lit home, with fuel for cooking on tap,\nand access to mobility options including a personal vehicle, mass transit, and\nair travel? We can ballpark it by taking the per capita energy footprint of\nCanadians and multiplying it by the eight billion people in the world, which\ngives us about 2.4 × 1021 joules per year, roughly ten times the current\nglobal energy consumption. That’s the total amount of energy that would be\nneeded each year for every person on the planet to have access to the same\ngenerous amount of energy as the average Canadian (I used Canada, not the\nU.S., because it’s similar but both colder and larger). While worldwide energy\nconsumption is increasing over time, the amount of energy used in wealthy,\nindustrialized countries like Canada has been pretty flat for the past few\ndecades, which suggests that energy usage plateaus. The global growth in\nenergy consumption over time is mostly driven by economic development—more\npeople getting access to more resources, and hence to more energy.\n\nEstimating the total energy usage of humanity, with all the different and\nchanging ways that it’s used by people all over the world, is an ongoing\nchallenge. Estimating the amount of solar energy landing on Earth, on the\nother hand, is a relatively straightforward question of experimental physics\nand geometry. In its orbit, eight light-minutes away, Earth intercepts only a\ntiny fraction of all of the energy coming off the Sun but it’s enough to bathe\nour planet in radiant light and warmth to the tune of about 5.5 × 1024 joules\neach year. That means that our estimate of the civilizational energy usage to\nmeet the needs of every human on Earth is about 0.04 percent of the incident\nsolar radiation (which also powers the movement of wind and water on the\nplanet). Four parts in ten thousand. The tiniest fraction of the sun’s energy\ncould power all the infrastructural systems we use today, and probably a good\nlong while into the future. That means it’s at least _feasible_ that our\nenergy usage, as a species, could be sustainable, in the biggest possible\npicture and the longest possible time frame. This long-range view shows us\nthat our fragile blue-green marble of a planet, suspended in space, is\nabsolutely awash in energy—enough to provide all humans with the power to live\ncomfortable lives of agency and connection.\n\nWe’re accustomed to thinking about reducing carbon emissions as going hand in\nhand with reducing energy consumption. But knowing that there is enough\nrenewable energy to meet the needs of every human on Earth is a big deal,\nbecause it changes the terms of the problem. Rather than focusing on\n_reducing_ our energy usage—a scarcity mindset—we instead can focus on\n_increasing_ the amount of energy that comes from renewable sources. And we\nhave a suite of emerging technologies that allow us to get energy without\nsetting anything on fire, which means that for the first time in human\nhistory, it’s possible to entirely decouple energy usage from carbon\nemissions. If we put these together, we can realize that stabilizing the\nglobal climate doesn’t have to mean rationing or limiting energy usage, and it\ndoesn’t have to mean sacrifice. Transitioning rapidly and completely into\nrenewable, decarbonized sources of power is how humanity can access\nunprecedented energy abundance.\n\nIt’s possible to power our entire technological society on renewable energy.\nThe next step is to figure out how.\n\n## The Energy Transition for Infrastructure (and Everything Else)\n\nSwitching to renewable sources requires harvesting this energy, which is\ntypically diffuse or intermittent, and transforming it into a form where it’s\nreliably available to do useful work on demand. That means technologies for\ngeneration and also ways to concentrate, store, and distribute that power.\nThat’s the upstream part—transforming the supply and distribution of energy.\n\nThe downstream part is usage. Everything in our lives that currently uses\nfossil fuels directly, like heating, cooking, and transportation, will instead\nneed to run on electricity. When natural gas distribution first arrived in New\nYork in the 1950s, technicians went from kitchen to kitchen to manually adjust\nevery single stovetop burner and oven element in the city because natural gas\nburns hotter than the coal-derived town gas that it was replacing. Figuring\nout how to effectively use renewable energy sources means not only developing\nthe technologies and building out the new systems but, in much of the world,\nit means managing the conversion. All the vehicles, appliances, and other\nequipment that treat fossil fuels as a utility will need to be replaced or\nretrofitted.\n\nThis transition would require the near-total transformation of three\ninfrastructural networks. Two of them rely on fossil fuels for direct\ncombustion at the point of use. One is the utility gas piped to buildings\n(here in the northeast U.S., it’s a primary energy source for heating as well\nas for hot-water heaters and cooking) and the second is transportation, since\nvehicles are almost entirely powered by internal combustion. Most of this\nenergy would need to come from the electrical grid, which is the third, and\noverarching, system that would need to be transformed. Decarbonizing energy\ninfrastructure means retiring thermal generation that relies on burning fossil\nfuels (coal, oil, or natural gas, as well as temporary sources of electricity\nlike diesel generators) and replacing it with electricity from renewable\nsources. It also means growing this electricity supply enough to replace all\nthe energy that’s currently coming from fossil fuels at the point of use.\n\n## Diffuse, Diverse, and Distributed\n\nAn important difference—maybe _the_ important difference—between fossil fuels\nand renewable energy sources is that the former are concentrated and the\nlatter are diffuse. This is true in both physical and geographical terms.\nFossil fuels are energy-dense, which is why we’ve built transportation systems\naround them. It takes about seventy-five seconds to fill up the tank of my car\nand the gasoline weighs less than a hundred pounds. Even though only about 30\npercent of the energy from combustion gets turned into forward movement, it’s\nstill enough for nearly six hours of travel at highway speeds. Fossil fuels\nare also concentrated in certain places in the planet—the coal mines of\nAppalachia, Newcastle, and Inner Mongolia; the oil fields of Texas, Saudi\nArabia, and western Siberia; the oil sands of Alberta; the North Sea reserves\noff the coasts of Norway and Scotland. Renewable energy sources, like solar,\nwind, hydropower, and geothermal energy, have a much broader geographical\ndistribution, but they’re also diffuse. In order to be used effectively, the\nenergy needs to be captured and concentrated. That builds in a strong bias\ntoward using the renewable sources that are most locally abundant or\naccessible—solar power in tropical India, geothermal for heating and\nelectricity generation in seismically active Iceland, hydropower in Alaska,\nwind turbines in Oklahoma.\n\nWhile the technologies continue to advance, particularly around increasing\nefficiency, thermal generation of electricity using coal or natural gas is a\nmature technology, and plants can be built pretty much anywhere in the world\nthat can get a steady supply of fuel. In contrast, diversity of renewable\nenergy sources rewards a diversity of approaches to harnessing it, which means\nthe technologies tend to be specific to where they’re located. They’re also in\ndifferent degrees of development, although they’re generally less mature than\nthe fossil fuel technologies that have a century or more of industrial\nresearch and practice behind them. In February 2020, I finally got the chance\nto take a tour of the wind farm at San Gorgonio Pass, outside Palm Springs,\nhaving driven past the rows upon rows of gently spinning white turbines a\nnumber of times. Exactly like Electric Mountain, the tour began in a trailer\nwhere a guide who’d had a long association with the site gave an overview to\nour group of interested tourists, mostly retirees, before we all piled into a\nminibus to get a closer look at the turbines. We also had a chance to look\naround what I could only think of as a wind turbine graveyard, where failed\nexamples of designs from decades past had been laid to rest. That impression\nwas heightened by the informational markers, which were the tips of turbine\nblades embedded upright in the desert ground, so that the squared-off base and\narched top echoed the classic headstone shape. Each was labeled with details\nof the design, the dates the turbine was operational, and the mode of failure\n(the cause of death was mostly that they ripped themselves apart while in\nuse). Most of the active turbines were all very similar, because it’s a\nlargely mature technology—they’re based on what’s known as the “Danish\ndesign,” with its slender, gracefully curved blades, a self-centering nacelle,\nand a gearing system that allows it to work efficiently and safely at a range\nof wind speeds. The turbine was developed and refined with the support of\npublic funding from the government of Denmark and policy incentives that\nresulted in the widespread adoption of wind power, the majority via wind\nenergy cooperatives. Solar panels are similarly mature, due in large part to\ndecades of government funding and the global policy support which shepherded\nhigher-efficiency panels out of the lab and into large-scale commercial\nproduction, while reducing the cost of installations. Geothermal power systems\nare already in use in seismic hot spots, especially along the Ring of Fire\nencircling the Pacific Ocean. Technologies to harness the heat of the earth\nfrom a wider range of locations are under development. Renewable energy\nprojects leverage existing expertise and equipment, particularly from the\nfossil fuel industry, borrowing drilling techniques for geothermal power or\nrepurposing the highly specialized ships that are used to transport and set up\noffshore oil rigs to instead build out offshore wind turbines. All of these\ntechnologies are continuing to develop and diversify, a Cambrian explosion of\nsustainable power.\n\nA wind farm or a solar plant typically has a much bigger physical footprint on\nthe ground than a conventional thermal generating plant that produces the same\namount of electricity. Large-scale renewable energy installations are often\nbuilt up of modular parts, spread across the landscape, like the San Gorgonio\nPass wind farm, with its row after row of turbines. At the solar farm in\nTelangana, not only were the individual solar panels modular and swappable,\nbut the whole plant was built out in two halves. That modularity also lends\nitself to different scales and to distributed generation, in the form of many\nsmaller installations rather than fewer, larger ones. Thermodynamics\nconsiderations mean that thermal generators generally get more efficient as\nthey get bigger, so they’re built as large power plants, not by daisy-chaining\ntogether smaller turbines. Decentralized and distributed generation of power\nfrom fossil fuels looks like a neighborhood filled with loud, polluting diesel\ngenerators. (It also looks like one filled with private gasoline-burning cars,\nof course.) Distributed generation of renewable energy, on the other hand,\nmight look like a neighborhood with solar panels on every roof, or with heat\npumps, or with small wind turbines.\n\nTransitioning to renewables also means learning to use the energy that’s\npresent in the local environment. I visited an experimental, small-scale, run-\nof-river hydroelectric power turbine in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, just\ndownstream of the Slater Mill, a water-powered cotton mill that dates back to\n1793 and is considered the first factory in the U.S. (and the site of the\nfirst factory strike in the U.S., led by young women workers in 1824). “Run-\nof-river” means that there is no reservoir—instead, a fraction of the flow of\nwater in the river is diverted to the turbine, used to produce electricity,\nand then returned. In order to limit the environmental and ecological impact,\na minimum water level in the river is maintained, as at Niagara Falls. The\namount of power generated then depends entirely on the flow, more in the\nspring when the water is flowing fast with melting snow and less from the\nsleepy river of late summer and early autumn. In contrast to the massive\nreservoirs of traditional hydroelectricity, the ecological disruption is\nminimal, which means that many more sites are viable. Small-footprint, run-of-\nriver hydro is already a significant fraction of electricity production in\nmountainous British Columbia.\n\nThis list of technologies for harnessing energy in the environment is by no\nmeans exhaustive. They’re all sufficiently developed that we have reason to\nbelieve that decarbonizing our infrastructural systems is technologically\npossible, but not so far along that there aren’t still new ideas and new\npossibilities emerging. By its very nature, renewable energy is likely to be\nmuch more diverse, using a range of energy sources in a variety of ways\naccording to what’s locally abundant or accessible.\n\n## From Supply to Storage\n\nAll things considered, demand for electricity is surprisingly predictable—the\nway it changes with the time of year, with that diurnal “duck curve,” and with\nthe weather. Decades of experience in how people use power, service areas that\nare large enough that individual differences are absorbed into an aggregate\nwhole, and reliable weather forecasts make it possible to accurately predict\nthe minute-by-minute demand for electricity.\n\nThe reliability of the electrical grid comes from just-in-time energy\nproduction, with careful oversight in grid operations centers to ensure that\ngeneration is closely matched to consumption. In large hydroelectric power\nstations, the water impounded behind the dam serves as a reserve of energy,\npowering a set of turbines lined up in parallel, with individual turbines spun\nup and down as needed during the day. Nuclear plants, on the other hand,\nproduce large amounts of power but the amount can’t be changed quickly, so\nthey typically supply the stable base load. It’s why they pair beautifully\nwith fast-response pumped-storage hydroelectricity stations, like Dinorwig.\nPowering the pumps that reset the reservoirs with the “excess” energy from\nnuclear power during the overnight lull in demand hits the trifecta: it’s\nefficient, inexpensive, and low-emissions. By and large, though, the ability\nto match electricity supply to demand has depended on the use of fossil fuels,\nbecause they can make energy generation continuously scalable, in much the\nsame way that putting your foot on the gas pedal makes a car go faster while\neasing up on it means the car slows down. Thermal generating stations are\nvastly more complicated, of course, but the basic principle still applies:\ncontrol of the timing and amount of fuel input means full control of the\nelectricity output. It’s part of why peaker plants, which handle the intervals\nof highest electricity demand, typically run on natural gas or petroleum.\n\nBut with renewable sources, the available energy can vary considerably over\ntime. Some of that is predictable: hydropower, wind, and solar power all vary\nseasonally in predictable ways, and sunrise brings every night to an end, at a\ntime that is calculable and inviolate. Superimposed over these patterns is the\ndaily unpredictability of the weather, whether it’s clouds over solar panels\nor a windless day that becalms all the local turbines. The moment-by-moment\nsupply of renewable energy, therefore, can be intrinsically uncontrolled and\nsomewhat unpredictable. Since insufficient supply to meet demand leads to\nbrownouts or even blackouts, this feeds into concerns (or fearmongering) about\nthe “unreliability” of renewables. A supply that’s much greater than the\ndemand can also be a problem—at worst, unplanned-for electricity means power\nsurges in the grid.\n\nSwitching to renewable energy, then, means figuring out a way to reliably meet\ndemand without having the fine-grained control of supply that fossil fuels\nprovide. The first step is already part of conventional generation:\naggregating the electricity supply into a shared grid. This lets us average\nout unpredictable variation across different places—it might be cloudy in San\nFrancisco but sunny in Los Angeles, so we can share solar power between them.\nIt also allows switching between different modes of energy generation. The\nMojave Desert is home to not just the wind farm in the San Gorgonio Pass but\nalso a number of large-scale solar projects, which means that cloudy days\nmight be offset by windy ones, and sunshine helps to maintain the power supply\non calm days. But effectively using renewable sources also means capturing the\nelectricity at the moment it’s produced and keeping it available for use when\ndemand is high or because weather events like _dunkelflaute_ , “dark\ndoldrums,” periods of cloud cover with little wind, mean that production is\nlow. This requires energy storage, whether it’s for hours, days, or even\nweeks.\n\nPumped-storage hydroelectricity plants are the granddaddies of grid-scale\nenergy storage, a widespread, mature technology for storing large amounts of\nenergy indefinitely. At the other end of the size scale for electricity\nstorage are the ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries that power portable\nelectronics, made larger to store proportionally more electricity.\nRechargeable batteries can hold their charge for long periods of time and\nthey’re energy-dense. I keep an emergency battery pack in my car that packs\nenough of a wallop to jump-start the engine but is still small enough to hold\nin one hand. Rechargeable batteries have significant downsides, though. First,\nthey’re expensive. More than cost, however, is the issue that battery\nproduction for the grid is in competition for materials and fabrication\ncapacity with consumer products. This includes electric cars, however, and\nvehicle batteries might end up being grid-scale storage in a roundabout way:\nthey can act as a distributed storage grid for renewables, including serving\nas an emergency power source. But the biggest concerns, by far, are the\ngeopolitical issues and environmental costs associated with mining and\nrefining the raw materials for batteries—not just lithium but also cobalt and\neven copper. All of these concerns will get a lot worse if production scales\nup without reconsidering how to handle extraction, disposal, and recycling, or\ndeveloping alternative ways of storing energy.\n\nJust as renewable generation can match the specific conditions where the\nenergy is being generated, storage can too, including co-locating it\nalongside. I walked through fields of solar panels at the Telangana plant, and\nthe San Gorgonio Pass wind farm stretches for miles alongside Interstate 10.\nEnergy storage in places like these doesn’t require the compact portability of\nbatteries—quite the opposite. One possibility is gravity storage, where a\ncrane equipped with an electric motor and a cable stacks up concrete blocks\nand is then run “backward”—as a generator—when the blocks are picked up from\nthe stack and lowered back down to the ground. It’s exactly the same principle\nas pumped-storage hydro, except that the potential energy is stored in\nconcrete blocks instead of water, so it can be built out almost anywhere and\nwith common materials. New technologies under development include chemical\nbatteries that are optimized for reversible storage and longevity instead of\nenergy density. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have\nbeen developing a number of different battery systems, including one that uses\nplain old iron oxide and a reversible rusting process, storing energy in\nchemical bonds and then running the reaction in reverse to produce electricity\nwhen needed, months or even years later. Like renewable energy generation,\nsome grid-scale storage technologies are already feasible but there’s also a\nwhole a host of emerging technologies, different ways of filling different\nniches.\n\n## Decarbonizing Heating and Cooling\n\nIn North America, direct combustion in the home is used for three main\npurposes: cooking, home heating, and hot-water heating. The fuel is mostly\nutility gas, but heating oil is common for homes in New England and elsewhere\nthat aren’t on a municipal gas grid. Burning fossil fuels to produce heat to\ngenerate electricity, delivering it, and then turning it back into heat is\nless efficient and therefore usually more expensive than in-home combustion. A\ndecarbonized grid drastically alters the economics of using electricity to\ngenerate heat. Not only does it sidestep these inefficiencies, it can mean _no\nlonger paying for fuel at all_. This model is already in effect for places\nlike Quebec. Despite the bitterly cold winters, electric heating is common\nbecause the public power utility generates cheap, abundant hydroelectricity.\nIt can also be an economically compelling argument for energy-hungry\ncommercial users. Lava Glass, a glassblowing studio in Aotearoa New Zealand,\nhas gone carbon-neutral, including replacing gas-fired furnaces with electric\nones powered by their local utility, produced from hydroelectric and\ngeothermal plants. Since the energy costs of the huge quantities of heat\nproduced by the furnaces and the annealing ovens are a major expense for any\nhot shop, the switch from gas to local renewable electricity means not only\nlowering their operating costs but also stabilizing the costs and the supply.\nIt’s easy to lose sight of this in the complexities of policy and utility\npricing, but whether it’s at the scale of solar panels on the roof of a\nsingle-family home or the entire electrical grid, making an upfront investment\nin renewable generation is intrinsically related to reduced day-to-day energy\ncosts. The higher the energy costs, the better the financial argument to make\nthat capital investment.\n\nBut phasing out direct combustion is also an opportunity to do things\ndifferently, on the household and on the community scale. There’s no reason to\ndo a one-to-one replacement of petroleum-derived heating sources with\nelectrical heating sources, since electricity lends itself to a very different\nset of uses. For example, induction burners are more efficient for cooking\nthan traditional electrical burners in the same way that microwaves\nare—targeting the energy to a particular material (metal for induction, water\nmolecules for microwaves) means that less energy is wasted in warming up the\nkitchen. We can replace furnaces with heat pumps or with thermal energy\nstorage, in which hot-water heaters with insulated reservoirs can use\ninexpensive or excess electricity to heat water and store it for later use,\nincluding in radiators or underfloor heating. Or indeed, the opposite: instead\nof time-shifting electricity use by storing energy in the form of heat, it can\nbe stored in the form of cold. Ice storage air-conditioning is already\ncommonly used in large buildings and college campuses, where ice is produced\novernight and water is circulated through it to produce chilled coolant during\nthe day, so that electricity usage for air-conditioning no longer peaks with\nafternoon temperatures. At the community scale, the hyperlocal nature of\nsustainable energy can be used to advantage, including using it directly for\ndistrict heating, skipping the electricity-generation step. In volcanic\nReykjavik, homes are geothermally heated by pumping water down to the hotter\nsubsurface regions and then circulating it through a municipal grid. At the\nother end of the temperature scale, Toronto is building out a deepwater\ncooling system on the shore of Lake Ontario, pumping cold water up from the\ndepths and circulating it through buildings in the downtown core to keep them\ncomfortable on hot summer days. Moving away from combustion at the point of\nuse opens the door to other ways of meeting basic human needs for food and\nshelter from the elements.\n\n## A Future for Transportation\n\nAs an urban resident in the Global North, I get to use an astonishing array of\npassenger vehicles regularly: my car, trains (subway, commuter, and\nintercity), buses, and streetcars/trams, plus I take ferries and planes a few\ntimes a year. I’m also a cyclist as well as a pedestrian. If our criterion is\nonly that we want our children and grandchildren to have the same sort of\naccess to personal mobility as I do—that all of these specific systems remain\nfunctional a century from now—it means that the energy they use needs to be\nfrom sustainable sources, ones that don’t contribute to greenhouse gas\nemissions. A simple starting point is to imagine all of the same vehicles,\npowered by electricity instead of combustion. What might that look like?\n\nSome of them already can or do run on electricity. Vehicles that travel on\nfixed routes can sidestep the need to carry their own fuel by being connected\nto the electrical grid instead. It’s common for urban public transit, with a\nthird rail that powers subway trains or overhead catenary lines for trams and\nstreetcars. The Amtrak rail line was fully electrified up to Boston in\npreparation for the launch of the high-speed Acela service that runs through\nNew York to Washington, DC. (Most of Amtrak’s passenger service uses dual-\npower diesel/electric locomotives, a hybrid model that lets them run on non-\nelectrified tracks on more lightly traveled routes and take advantage of\nelectricity when it’s available, especially in facilities like New York’s Penn\nStation, where it’s preferred because it minimizes pollution and fire risk.)\n\nFor vehicles that don’t run on fixed routes and therefore do need to carry\ntheir own power source, the second approach to electrification is the use of\nbatteries, as in electric cars. While batteries are heavier than gasoline or\ndiesel, there’s some serious energy upside. Even the most efficient internal\ncombustion engines in modern cars max out at less than 35 percent useful\nenergy harvested from the heat produced by burning fuel, while converting\nelectricity into motion is more like 75–80 percent efficient. Electric\nvehicles are so comparatively efficient that no matter where the electricity\nto charge the batteries comes from, even if it’s from coal-fired generating\nstations, they still use less energy and produce fewer emissions than\nconventional vehicles. What’s more, a conventional vehicle locks in emissions\nfor the entire lifetime of the vehicle, whereas electric vehicles, without any\nchange in how they’re used, can actually get cleaner with time as the\nelectricity grid gets a greater and greater proportion of energy from\nnonpolluting sources. That means there’s no reason to wait until the grid is\nfully decarbonized to transition to electric vehicles.\n\nThis is especially true for freight. Heavy trucks are 1 percent of vehicles\nbut account for 25 percent of emissions. Converting trucking fleets to\nelectric vehicles does mean addressing all the same issues as passenger\nvehicles, including range anxiety and standardizing charging infrastructure.\nBut as these networks get built out, the utility of electric freight vehicles\nwill increase, with significant and continuing cost savings on fuel.\n\nIf passenger cars are the most straightforward to decarbonize, flying might be\nthe hardest technical challenge. Powered flight, where every gram matters, is\nreally built around the availability and incredible energy density of\npetroleum. The high weight-to-energy ratio of even the best commercially\navailable batteries means that electrifying powered flight is still a thorny\ntechnical challenge. Some of the most promising technologies for decarbonizing\naviation are based around using hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives as fuel\ninstead of batteries, taking advantage of the energy density of chemical bonds\nwithout the greenhouse gas emissions of carbon-based fuels.\n\nTransportation infrastructure, particularly for personal mobility, is\nparadoxical. On the one hand, it can feel like we’re making individual\ndecisions about mobility—deciding to have a car, deciding to drive or take the\ntrain, deciding to bike or take the bus. On the other hand, perhaps more than\nany other infrastructural network, the available options are shaped by what’s\nimmediately around us: the intersection of the natural environment, the built\nenvironment, and all of the human-created elements of transportation systems,\nfrom the price of parking to the frequency of the subway to the specific bus\nroute. Once those systems are in place—or removed, as in the case of the\nstreetcar lines that once dominated urban transit in cities like Los\nAngeles—it’s hard to even consider alternatives. Having spent most of my teen\nyears and then twenties as a student in a large city, I didn’t learn how to\ndrive until I was nearing the end of my PhD program and wasn’t sure where I’d\nmove next. Only after I accepted a faculty position at Olin College did I\nactually get my driver’s license. For my first month as a professor, I took\nthe commuter rail out to the suburbs and then walked forty minutes each way to\ncampus. I used my first paycheck to buy a car, just in time for classes to\nstart. I’d never in my life been alone at the wheel until I picked my new car\nup at the dealership. My commute was now expensive and infinitely more\nstressful—a brand-new driver in Boston rush-hour traffic every day!—but it\nalso took less than an hour of my day instead of nearly four. This is what we\nmean when we talk about much of the U.S. and Canada being car-centric: in many\nplaces, the dominant transportation mode is private vehicles because that’s\nwhat the local environment supports. It’s an infrastructure trap. The\nresources that have been sunk into a specific way of doing something to make\nit easier means that it’s that much harder to do anything else. The\nalternatives have become challenging or impossible, paradoxically reducing\nagency and choice rather than increasing it.\n\nMaking private vehicles quiet and nonpolluting would be great—don’t get me\nwrong. In many places, especially rural areas, this is likely the path to\nfollow. But once we begin to entertain the possibility of replacing every gas-\nor diesel-powered vehicle on the road, we also open up new possibilities.\nNothing says that we have to build out the same systems and networks we had\nbefore—what might we want to change? What new patterns of housing and\ncommunities would support different transportation options? If our goal is for\nour children and grandchildren to have the same access to personal mobility as\nwe do, what might we want to do _differently_?\n\nReplacing every car on the road with an electric equivalent doesn’t address\nall of the _other_ issues with private cars, especially in cities, where they\ndominate neighborhoods by excluding other users of the space, and are a major\nsafety issue. Cars don’t scale well. All the negative externalities associated\nwith cars increase as the number or density of cars increases, and there are\nfew, if any, upsides. Cars don’t get any cheaper if more people have them, and\npollution and congestion only get worse, not better, with more cars.\n\nIt’s true that I can walk out any time of day or night, get into my car, and\ndrive to nearly any point on the continent, as long as it isn’t rush hour and\nthe point in question isn’t in downtown Boston. But this car-mediated level of\nagency is inaccessible to many people: it excludes people who are unable to\ndrive safely because of age (which includes not just older people but children\nas well) or health, it requires the full and careful attention of a driver,\nand not only is owning a private vehicle exclusionary simply because it’s\nexpensive, but even just firing up the engine means energy costs. While semi-\nor fully autonomous cars are intended to address some of these issues, they\nwon’t address issues of cost or traffic. As someone who drives in congested\nand idiosyncratic Boston, where we routinely do things like go down the\ncenterline of a two-lane one-way street after a big winter storm because the\nplowed-aside snow fills the curb half of each lane, I think it’ll be a while,\nif ever, before self-driving cars are tenable in dense, complex, multiuse\nsettings like cities.\n\nPublic transit, on the other hand, does scale with density. Like other forms\nof networked infrastructure, the more people who use it and the denser the\nnodes, the more effective and useful it is. The point of transportation\ninfrastructure isn’t access to any particular kind of vehicle: it’s about\npersonal mobility and agency. Two decades after I first started commuting, a\nnew factor has come into play: when I’m at the wheel of my car, I can only\ndrive. I’d happily trade that commute for an hour or so on a train, taking\nadvantage of my laptop, phone, and data networks to get started on my workday\nor to catch up with my friends.\n\nSo much has changed in the last fifty or so years, since the rise of the\nautomobile and the built environment that supports it. A few years ago, I went\nwith Robinson Meyer to visit the Faroe Islands, in the North Atlantic, about\nequidistant between northern Scotland, Norway, and Iceland. The tiny\narchipelago is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, with a total population\nof about fifty thousand people, about ten thousand of whom live in the largest\ncity, Tórshavn. We flew into the airport, picked up our rental car, and drove\nvia a modern tunnel to the city. Over the past twenty or so years, the\ntransportation and telecommunications infrastructure of the islands has been\nbuilt out to support a goal of broadening the islands’ economic base and\nmaking it possible for inhabitants to fully participate in European and global\nsociety and culture without needing to relocate to the “big city” of Tórshavn\nor the European mainland. Rob and I went to the northernmost part of the\nisland and stood on a beach in the long twilight of the summer solstice in the\nfar north, in a village that was home to only a few dozen Faroese souls.\nGazing west with nothing but the North Atlantic between me and Labrador, I\nnoticed there were five bars of signal in the corner of my glowing phone. The\nnext day we took a ferry to Sandoy and our host pointed out a new furniture\nfactory, whose location was made possible by those new communications and\ntransport links.\n\nI think about this model all the time: the way that a combination of\ntransportation infrastructure, decentralized energy generation, and modern\ntelecommunications creates possibilities beyond crowded agglomerations\nsurrounded by neglected hinterlands. What if we lived in a multiscalar\narchipelago of communities within communities, extending through the suburbs\nand exurbs and into rural areas? It could be made possible by transportation\nlinks, supply chains, and high-bandwidth telecommunications networks that\nallow for distributed work and collaboration. Options for local travel might\ninclude e-bikes and microbuses in addition to cars, with mass transit in\ndenser regions, all connected by high-speed transportation links for medium or\nlonger distance travel. Instead of transportation systems that are focused on\ncities, on moving daily commuters and resources into and out of a central\ncore—the five-day-a-week rush hour commute is already beginning to feel like a\nholdover from the past—transport networks could facilitate movement from place\nto place around a more decentralized map, including “chaining” trips. Personal\nmobility is what we exercise to be with our family and friends, for leisure\nand pleasure and care, not just for work.\n\n## Some Visions for the Next Century\n\nWhen I read about what major cities were like a century and a half ago, I\nalways find it a bit shocking—they were gray, crowded, loud, dangerous, and\npolluted. A tiny fraction of the residents lived lives of comfort; poverty,\nhunger, lack of adequate shelter, and sickness were rampant and accepted. A\nhundred years from now, when we look back to the way we live today, could we\nbe equally shocked? I imagined playing host to time-traveling neighborhood\nresidents from the past. Now I can imagine being the traveler myself, visiting\nmy home in the future.\n\nIn this vision, my neighborhood is noticeably greener than it is now, the main\nstreet narrow and the pedestrian and cyclist routes wide. The air is clean and\nquiet, save for the soft hum of electric buses and delivery vehicles. The\noldest subway in the U.S. still runs below my feet, and it’s bright and modern\nand frequent, filled with riders, taking them around the city and to the\ntransit hubs of North and South Stations. High-speed intercity rail whisks\npassengers to cities up and down the East Coast, to the Midwest and into\nCanada. Or they’re heading to the regional airport and on to communities all\nover the world, the connections with their friends, families, and colleagues\neverywhere fostered and sustained by distributed, decentralized\ntelecommunications networks, like the Internet and its successors. As I walk\ndown the street, I recognize a few antique solar panels and wind turbines that\nare still in service, but most of the structures that harness and store\nrenewable energy are either unrecognizable to present-day me or, like the\ncurrent systems, sit invisibly inside or underneath what I can see. The\nbuildings and vehicles around me track and predict energy generation, storage,\nand consumption, nodes on a smart grid that share electricity among themselves\nso it’s reliably available where and when it’s needed. These energy, mobility,\nand communications networks underpin daily life and are also the backbone of\nresilient, disaster-tolerant infrastructural systems that help manage the\nhuman costs of climate instability. Abundant, locally situated energy means\nthat every community is equally well served for their power needs. When heavy\nweather comes in, whether howling nor’easters in the winter or megahurricanes\ncoming up the coast in the late summer, the local grids stay up and ensure\nthat there is power to ride out the storm. The greenery around me also serves\nto absorb that heavy rain, a buffer that averts flooding.\n\nIf this future seems boring, that’s sort of the point! And this is just one\npossible vision of one neighborhood—it would look different all over the U.S.\nand the world. I sketched it out as a future for infrastructural systems not\nbecause it’s the most likely, or even the most desirable, but because it’s an\nexample of the kinds of resilient, sustainable systems that are possible. The\nfuture of infrastructural systems everywhere will be locally situated and\ndependent. The technologies that might serve as the building blocks of any\npossible future are being invented and refined by the day. I’m not making\npredictions or providing answers, but instead opening a door to consider\ndifferent possibilities for a long-term vision of infrastructural systems.\n\nJust about two centuries ago, access to increasing amounts of energy in the\nform of fossil fuels began to transform our world by powering collective\nnetworks, at first slowly and then unstoppably. The value of these systems—the\ncapacity they provide—is so clear that it’s almost invisible. As the\nbeneficiaries of these systems, we now have our opportunity in turn. We can\nrecognize what we have in these systems, take everything we learned during the\nIndustrial Revolution, and rebuild them for the coming generations.\nTransitioning our infrastructural systems to be fully powered by nonpolluting\nenergy sources will make them not only functional and sustainable but\nintrinsically more resilient and equitable. Rebuilding them gives us the\nopportunity to reconsider how well they work, and what we might do\ndifferently. What does a transportation network look like in a world with the\nInternet? What does energy use look like in a world with inexpensive\nrenewables?\n\nResilient and responsive infrastructural systems will be one of our best\ncommunity tools for responding to climate change and getting through it with a\nminimum of human suffering. Functional infrastructure is what makes it\npossible for people to shelter in place, or to evacuate an affected area.\nCommunication networks make it possible to gather and share information and\ncoordinate community responses. Diverse and decentralized energy generation,\ndistribution, and storage mean that communities can be self-sufficient in the\nface of disruptions, with power for heating, cooling, light, and cooking, and\nto support neighboring communities.\n\nRebuilding infrastructural systems to be functional means that they will be\nlocally specific and sustainable, no longer reliant on a steady stream of gas\nor oil, with a corresponding outflow of money and pollutants. Harnessing\nrenewable energy effectively means it can be abundant, everywhere, providing\nthe opportunity for everyone, no matter where they live, to have access to the\nenergy that serves, as Amartya Sen described wealth, as a general-purpose tool\nto live the kinds of lives we have reason to value.\n\nThere is a possible future for humanity where we have stabilized our climate,\nwhere everyone has the energy and resources that they need to survive and\nthrive, where we get to connect with each other in myriad ways. I get to use\n“we” in the best possible way, meaning all of humanity. Running the numbers\nand realizing exactly how abundant renewable energy is, and then realizing how\nclose we are to being able to harness it—it’s an absolute game changer. We’re\naccustomed to thinking about making the transition away from fossil fuels to\nrenewable sources as one that we are doing under duress, making a sacrifice to\nstave off disaster. But that’s not what we’re doing. What we’re doing is\n_leveling up_. We—you, me, anyone who is alive today—we have the opportunity\nto not just live through but contribute to a species-wide transition from\nstruggle to security, from scarcity to abundance. We can be the best possible\nancestors to future generations, putting them on a permanent, sustainable path\nof abundance and thriving. And we can do it for all of our descendants— _all_\nof humanity—not just a narrow line.\n\nBut we can only do it together, and we still need to figure out how to get\nthere.\n\nThe first big challenge is materials. Rebuilding our infrastructural systems\nwill require an enormous amount of new _stuff_. All those solar panels, wind\nturbines, and batteries; all those heat pumps, thermal storage systems, new\nelectric stoves and heaters; all those vehicles. The materials cost of a\ntransition like this will be intense because of all the new physical systems\nthat will need to be built. That cost will include everything associated with\nextracting the necessary raw materials, fabricating the new systems, and\ntransporting them to where they will be used. We’ve done this once before—we\nbuilt our modern technological world from scratch, after all—but this\ntransition can’t just be treated like an accelerated version of everything\nthat happened over the last century or two, because we know the cost isn’t\njust monetary. It includes all the negative externalities, the environmental\nand other impacts of both the new systems and the disposal of the now-obsolete\ntechnologies. To take this on means fundamentally rethinking how we manage\nmaterials throughout their entire life cycle. We live on a planet bathed in\nsunlight, but it’s at the bottom of a gravity well, surrounded by the void of\nspace. For all of human history, we’ve been living like energy is scarce and\nmatter is infinite, when in fact the opposite is true: we need to learn to\nlive like we have access to unlimited energy, but with the deep understanding\nthat the atoms we have to work with are part of a closed system. Clean,\nabundant energy will open all kinds of new technological possibilities, but\nwe’ll need a deep, society-wide rethink of our relationship to matter, to\nextraction, consumption, and waste.\n\nThe second big challenge is, well, everything else. Knowing that a new set of\ninfrastructural technologies is not just possible but desirable is the\nnecessary first step, but we still have to figure out how to get there. What’s\nchanged in the last fifty or so years is that most of the technological\nchallenges have been identified and addressed, and research and development is\nongoing, even accelerating. Now most of the remaining questions, and barriers,\naren’t technological. They are social, political, and economic. Having\nrealized that our infrastructural systems are the main way in which we use and\nbenefit from energy and matter, we understand that we need to transform them.\nBut how on earth do we transform these massive, collective systems? There is\nno one answer, although the modular, standardized structure of distributed\ninfrastructural systems has the potential to work to our advantage. As with\nour relationship with materials, we’ll need to reframe how we think about\nthese systems.\n\n\n# Ten\n\n# Rethinking the Ultrastructure\n\nInfrastructural systems make astonishing amounts of energy available in useful\nform—as light, as heat, as motion, and as generic power to be used as we want,\nliterally empowering us as individuals and as communities, embodied beings\ninteracting with the material world. These systems are the most important\npractical means we have of collectively implementing any version of “life,\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” That means we can’t walk away from\nthese systems, nor can we shut them down and start over.\n\nWe also can’t continue to do what we’ve been doing.\n\nJon Ardern, of the design firm Superflux, wrote that climate change “is not a\nproblem we can ‘solve’ but rather a predicament we must navigate with\nresponsibility and urgency.” Finding a route through the onset of\nanthropogenic climate change that limits human suffering and ecological\ndamage, means rethinking infrastructural systems. Rather than being reactive,\nwrong-footed by social and technological failures, we can instead learn how to\nbe responsive to our changing world while building toward something new.\n\nThe costs of transforming our technological systems to make them resilient and\nsustainable are right in front of us, in balance sheets and proposed budgets.\nBut the costs and harms of our current infrastructural systems—the ways in\nwhich they _don’t_ work well—are harder for us to see. They shape what we even\nbelieve to be possible, and so they make it easy to accept their negative\nimpacts as “just the way things are.” Traffic fatalities. Air pollution. A\nhighway that tears apart a neighborhood. Overdrawn groundwater or contaminated\nwater supplies. It’s even harder for us to wrap our brains around the benefits\nof transformed infrastructural systems. It requires active imaginative effort\nto understand what the upsides would be, and the futures they might enable. We\nhave to envision this different world, and choose to work toward it. Every\nHurricane Sandy, Maria, or Harvey, every Camp Fire, every blackout in a summer\nheatwave or a winter storm, and every multiyear drought is a message from the\nfuture where we haven’t reconsidered our infrastructural systems.\n\nWe know that there’s such an abundance of energy available on the earth that\nit’s possible to have functional infrastructural systems in fifty years, or a\nhundred, or more, and we can imagine what that might enable: a resilient,\nequitable, sustainable future for all of humanity, embedded in a thriving\nplanetary ecosystem. It’s a destination to navigate toward. But because these\nsystems generate and sustain our relationships to each other in a particular\nplace, and because they’re so contingent, shaped by all the decisions that\nhave come before, there really isn’t a road map, much less turn-by-turn\ndirections. The geographic, environmental, economic, social, political, and\nhistorical contexts of infrastructural systems differ from neighborhood to\nneighborhood, from continent to continent, and on every geographic scale in\nbetween.\n\nFor inspiration on ways to think about building new structures for\ninfrastructural provision that better reflect these intertwined goals of\nsustainability, resilience, and equitable access, I look to and learn from\nactivists for social change. Prison abolitionist Mariame Kaba, for example,\ndescribes the need to act in the short, medium, and long term, and at the\nindividual, community, institutional, and societal levels. But what actions\nshould we take around infrastructure? Building on our understanding of\ninfrastructural systems, where they came from, and how they work, we can pull\ntogether a set of heuristics. The six actionable principles for a new\nultrastructure that follow can help each of us make decisions about\ninfrastructure in a wide range of different contexts. They are also values to\narticulate and defend.\n\n## 1\\. Plan for Abundant Energy and Finite Materials\n\nWe’ve seen that there is enough energy incident on the planet that it’s\npossible to provide for all of humanity’s power needs from renewable sources\nalone. While there are still challenges, we already have most of the\ntechnologies necessary to harness, store, and distribute renewable energy, at\nall scales and price points, and it’s still early in the research,\ndevelopment, and adoption of these systems.\n\nThe first heuristic for making decisions about infrastructure is to make this\nmental and cultural shift and plan for energy abundance. We are not doomed to\na dystopian future of failing systems. Responding to climate change is not\nabout making a sacrifice and accepting a more straitened future for ourselves,\neveryone else on the planet, and generations to come. Responding to climate\nchange is an opportunity: to build out systems that are functional and remain\nso into the future, and to extend the agency provided by energy and collective\ninfrastructure to communities that, in the past, have had limited access. The\nproof of concept that humans are capable of building these systems together is\nall around us. We already live in a world that is defined by the development\nof technologies and practices that rely on cooperation up to and including the\nglobal level—around economics, around standards and systems, around our\necosystems, by the ability to work collectively at all scales.\n\nWhat does it mean to plan for energy abundance? In the short to medium term,\nit means spinning up renewable energy systems and transitioning other\ninfrastructural networks like transportation away from fossil fuels, as\nquickly and completely as possible. By decoupling energy consumption from\ncombustion, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced without giving up\neverything that access to energy enables. This doesn’t preclude investing in\nreduced power usage through efficiency, of course. The replacement of\nincandescent lightbulbs with LEDs over the course of the past decade is an\nexcellent case in point, since LED bulbs use about a tenth of the energy and\nlast about ten times longer. Just as importantly, they produce pleasing light\nand—especially important in warm climates—much less waste heat. Retrofitting\nbuildings so that they can be heated and cooled more efficiently also makes\nthem more comfortable and secure. Efficiency coupled with abundance isn’t\nabout managing scarcity. Instead, it’s an investment in thriving and comfort.\n\nThis technological transformation would require the wholesale replacement of\nmany of the physical systems in the world, large and small, with entirely\ndifferent ones. The net result will be a huge amount of embodied energy: all\nof the energy used to extract the raw materials, process them, manufacture\nthem into what’s needed, and deliver them to where they’ll be used. Even if it\nsaves years of emissions in the future, the scale of this transformation is\nall-encompassing, so making all this new equipment with existing combustion-\npowered systems means digging the climate-change hole we’re in even deeper.\nBut the faster that renewable energy sources come online, the faster the\nemissions cost of making the necessary materials and systems drops. The\nvicious circle of embodied energy and fossil fuel consumption instead becomes\na virtuous circle in which the energy necessary to build out a fully\ndecarbonized infrastructure gets steadily cleaner over time.\n\nSteel and concrete—the basic building blocks of civil engineering—are two of\nthe biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. In part that’s simply\nbecause they’re used in such huge quantities—annual global production is about\ntwo billion metric tons of steel and about fifteen billion cubic meters of\nconcrete, or about five hundred pounds of steel and close to three tons\nconcrete per human being on the planet, every year. It’s also because they\nboth involve manufacture at high temperatures, in energy-hungry furnaces and\nkilns that are usually powered by combustion. What’s more, the specific\nchemical reactions that are used to produce both steel and cement (the “active\ningredient” in concrete) result in the direct release of carbon dioxide.\nEmissions-free production will require a transformation in these industrial\nprocesses, with all of the research and the investment into new facilities\nthat entails. But for most building projects, the cost of raw materials like\nsteel and concrete is only a small part of the total cost, so getting end\nusers on board early can smooth the transition. The U.S. government, for\nexample, established a “Federal Buy Clean Initiative” in 2022. By guaranteeing\na market for carbon-neutral concrete and steel, it incentivizes the switch to\nzero-emissions production.\n\nDirect emissions and embodied energy are only part of the story. The actual\nstuff needed to build out these new systems—the copper, aluminum, iron,\nlithium, cobalt, silicon, polymers, and everything else—has to come from\nsomewhere. There is a significant, and reasonable, fear that the material\ndemands of a transition to renewable energy will lead to yet more extraction,\ndepredation, and conflict, only this time it’ll be over lithium and copper\ninstead of oil. Because the earth is a closed system for matter—barring the\nodd meteorite or spacecraft, nothing comes in or out—every atom also has to\nend up somewhere. The idea of business as usual—extracting raw materials from\nthe ground, turning them into products, and then dumping the waste as\npollution—isn’t just politically challenging or morally reprehensible, it’s\nalso fundamentally at odds with basic physics. Once we understand that\nmaterials are inherently limited, then it follows that we need to figure out\nhow to use and reuse atoms in useful ways, rather than dumping them after\nthey’ve been used once. Why don’t we do this already? Well, the usual reason\ngiven is that it’s too expensive, that it’s not cost-effective to recover and\nreuse the constituent raw materials once a product has reached the end of its\nuseful lifetime.\n\nFrom a technological point of view, when we say that it costs too much to do\nsomething, it almost always means that it requires too much _energy_ to do,\nand that energy has to be paid for. With cheaper power, even intrinsically\nenergy-intensive processes can be economically viable. Aluminum is a good\nexample. The metal wasn’t discovered until 1824, but that wasn’t because it’s\nrare—it’s the third-most common element in the earth’s crust—but because it’s\nsuch a challenge to purify. It takes an enormous amount of energy to isolate\naluminum from its ore and it always will, because it’s related to the strength\nof the chemical bond between aluminum and atoms like oxygen. But the\ndevelopment of a new refining process, coupled with the new availability of\nabundant and inexpensive energy sources like hydroelectricity, meant that\naluminum went from being a precious metal in the nineteenth century to quite\nliterally disposable in the twentieth. This dependence on energy and its cost\nhelps explain why aluminum is one of the few commodities that are currently\nrecycled in quantity, along with steel and glass. All three materials can be\nmelted and remade in processes that need so much less energy than making them\nin the first place that it offsets the costs associated with collecting and\nprocessing—in fact, waste glass (known as “cullet”) is essential to making new\nglass. Plastic, on the other hand, is such a huge and complex set of materials\nthat it’s incredibly hard to recycle. To really reuse the atoms in most waste\nplastic, the polymer needs to be pulled apart into its constituent atoms and\nthen chemically reassembled. Disassembly releases a lot of energy, which is\nwhat happens when plastics are incinerated. To reassemble them, all of that\nenergy and more needs to be put back into the material and paid for, which\nhelps explain why plastics are often incinerated or landfilled rather than\nrecycled. Commodity plastics like polyethylene and the plastic used for soda\nbottles are an important exception to this—they can be mechanically recycled\ninto new products—but the challenge of separating these specific plastics out\nfrom the others, particularly in light of the low cost of producing new\nmaterial, contributes to their dismally low recycling rate.\n\nIf fossil fuels are the available source of energy, then the amount needed\nscales linearly with the amount of energy used, and so the cost of that fuel\ndoes too. Energy-intensive processes cost a lot, and the more you make with\nthat process, the more it costs. But with renewable energy sources, the\nincremental costs of energy can be minimal because there are no longer fuel\ncosts. Electricity produced this way might not quite be too cheap to meter,\nbut it gets close. In a fully decarbonized system where all energy is\nrenewable, this will be true everywhere, all the time. This is a phase\nchange—a fundamental shift in what’s possible.\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, where I grew up, alcohol sales are highly regulated so\nmost beer in the province is purchased from (where else?) The Beer Store, a\nretail cooperative for breweries. It mostly comes in standardized brown glass\nbottles. You take a case of beer home, drink the beer, put the empties back in\nthe box, and return them the next time you go to buy beer. The bottles are\ncleaned, relabeled, and refilled until they get worn or damaged, at which\npoint they are recycled as cullet and turned into new beer bottles with a\nrecovery rate somewhere upwards of 95 percent. If we create a world where\n_all_ energy is cheap and clean, this kind of circularity can be extended to\nall of the materials we use, not just the ones where recycling saves energy,\nand including everything fabricated by putting different materials together.\nAll the plastic we use could be synthesized from waste plastic or from carbon\ndioxide in the air and then, after its useful lifetime, chemically torn apart\nand reused to make next week’s or next year’s plastic products. Instead of\nmining more and more minerals from the earth, the lithium, cobalt, and other\nmetals in spent batteries would be extracted and upcycled into new ones.\n\nOver the past century we’ve begun running into the planetary limits of the\nearth as a closed system. Whether it’s the CFCs that damaged the ozone layer\nor microplastic debris in the deepest oceans, we’re learning that we can’t\njust keep discarding waste into the world around us without measurable\nconsequences. Using renewable energy to support reuse and upcycling is an\nopportunity to move away from “cheaper” extraction, but circular systems of\nmaterials usage also minimize the negative impacts of pollution.\n\nThis is a cultural change, not just a technological one. Realizing that matter\nis limited but energy doesn’t have to be—both conceptually and in\npractice—means that the energy cost of recycling and refabrication will no\nlonger be a limiting factor in what’s possible. And like beating swords into\nplowshares, we can imagine transforming all the artifacts of a fossil\nfuel–powered culture into the ones necessary for a sustainable world. Getting\nrenewable energy fully up and running will change how we deal with physical\nmatter, because access to abundant energy with no fuel costs will make it\npossible to build out a technological world that’s modeled on the natural one,\na world where reuse of matter is the default.\n\nIn the short term, planning for abundant energy and limited matter might mean\nconservation and adaptive reuse of existing infrastructure, as well as putting\nenergy and resources into recovering materials or otherwise diverting them\nfrom the waste stream. In the medium term, that means continuing research into\nways to recover or recycle materials. But in the longer term, we can put the\nopportunities of renewable energy directly to work on the challenges of\nlimited materials.\n\nOnce the cost of energy is no longer a limiting factor, all sorts of otherwise\nintrinsically energy-intensive processes, like water desalination, become\neconomically and environmentally feasible. I can’t imagine everything that\nreadily available renewable energy might make possible, any more than people\nbefore the advent of fossil fuels could imagine what my life looks like today,\nbut it would certainly include everyone having access to potable water. In the\nlongest term, we can envision technological systems that are fully aligned\nwith the way that our planet works, with continuous inputs of energy but\nclosed loops for materials. And that system—sustainable, renewable, abundant,\nwhere everyone has what they need—is the world that we can work toward. The\npoint of transforming our infrastructural systems isn’t just to avoid the\nworst consequences of anthropogenic climate change—it’s to get to this world\nin which we can use that abundance of energy toward collective thriving, while\nstill respecting the limits and boundaries of our ecosystems and the planet.\n\n## 2\\. Design for Resilience\n\nMost of our infrastructural networks are generally designed, operated, and\nregulated to be robust and reliable, usually through redundancy. But they were\nbuilt out assuming a stable climate and are implicitly optimized for\nefficiency—that is, to use the least amount of time, energy, or other\nresources, which means taking as much slack as possible out of a system. This\nis especially true for private or investor-owned systems, where optimizing for\nefficiency is also minimizing costs. We see optimization in the moment-by-\nmoment matching of supply to demand in the energy grid or in the just-in-time\nnature of global shipping and transportation. In this model, any unused\ncapacity—empty seats on a plane, unused capacity of power plants—is seen as\nwaste. But you can’t optimize systems in a context that’s changing, especially\nif it’s changing in unpredictable ways. Removing inefficiencies when\ncircumstances are as anticipated means that there isn’t much slack in the\nsystem to respond when the unanticipated happens. Optimization is\nintrinsically brittle, because it’s about closely matching the output to the\nconditions, which means it’s vulnerable if those conditions change. What we’ll\nneed from our infrastructural systems, more and more, is for them to be\nresilient, able to absorb uncertainty and changing circumstances either\nwithout failing or by failing gracefully and reversibly, rather than\nunexpectedly or catastrophically.\n\nResilience can take many forms, but one important element of stepping away\nfrom just-in-time optimization is building in buffers. A buffer is always\nhaving a second box of your children’s favorite breakfast cereal in the\ncupboard for when the first one runs out, and then replacing that back-up box\nthe next time you go grocery shopping. In a world with a changing climate,\nbuffers become a crucial part of the tool kit. An electricity grid that mostly\nruns on renewable sources will need large-scale energy storage—batteries,\npumped-storage hydro, and the new grid-scale storage strategies that are under\ndevelopment—to buffer against the inherently variable nature of renewables. In\ncommunities that are susceptible to water scarcity, storage reservoirs act as\nbuffers for seasonal variations and drought. Heavy rainfall runs off\nimpermeable concrete and asphalt, but replacing these materials with soil and\nvegetation by dechannelizing rivers or creating permeable parking lot surfaces\nmeans that water is initially absorbed and then slowly released, or else it\nsinks down to recharge subsurface aquifers. Either way, the risk of flooding\nis reduced. Even the San Francisco Bay ferry acts as a buffer, ensuring an\nalternative to bridges and tunnels in a disaster situation.\n\nA buffer isn’t the same thing as a stockpile—it’s one extra box of breakfast\ncereal, not an entire shelf, enough to buy you a few days to get back to the\ngrocery store—but the size of the buffer is related both to how critical a\nresource it is and to the uncertainty around replenishment. Resilience isn’t\nefficient because it typically requires an upfront or ongoing investment of\nresources, in the form of time, money, energy, or cupboard space, in order to\nhead off worse outcomes. Humans are flexible and inventive, capable of\nfiguring out ways to respond to changing circumstances. Every time a system\nfails, whether in a small way or catastrophically, it’s humans who have to\ntake up the slack, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Sometimes the price\nis low; sometimes it’s tragically high. Once you start looking for it, this\nhuman-provided slack is everywhere. It might be as minor as the staffer who\nhelps customers at the self-checkout at the grocery store, or leaving home\nhalf an hour early to be sure of making an important meeting. It might be\ngiving up a seat on an overbooked flight to take a later one, or it might be\nas serious as improvising ways to make it through an extended blackout, or the\ncommunities of mutual aid that arise during natural disasters. But being\nresilient isn’t an intrinsic characteristic of humans. It’s an active state,\nand that means it has a cost in time, agency, labor, or even suffering.\nDesigning infrastructural systems for resilience rather than optimizing them\nfor efficiency is an epistemological shift as much as anything else. It’s\nrecognizing the uncertainty in the world and preparing to respond to it in a\nsystemic way by committing the resources to create resilient systems. It means\nno longer using individual humans, especially the most vulnerable—their time,\nagency, safety, and health—as the slack in the system.\n\n## 3\\. Build for Flexibility\n\nMany of us are accustomed to the idea of infrastructural facilities being both\nbig and long-lasting, not just charismatic megastructures like towering dams\nand bridges but also busy transportation hubs, huge power plants, and global\ntelecommunications networks. The size and durability of these systems reflect\nmore than just the scale of provision. Every infrastructural system locks in a\nway of doing something, and usually that’s the point—that pathway has been\nmade cheaper, easier, more efficient, or more desirable than the alternatives.\nIt’s an approach that makes sense when you have reason to believe that you’re\nbuilding out the right thing in the right way, and that it’ll remain so for a\nlong time. Like optimization, this approach is less compelling in the face of\nthe uncertainty and change of climate instability, because making large-scale\ncommitments also boxes out new opportunities and ways of doing things. We’re\nin the middle of an explosion of new technologies to harness, transform, and\ndistribute energy and materials. Flexible, exploratory, and contingent models\nof infrastructural systems are likely to be a better match for both the\nuncertainty and the opportunity of the twenty-first century and beyond.\n\nMaintaining that flexibility also means avoiding making decisions today that\nlock us into ways of doing into the future. At the individual level, buying a\nnew car with an internal combustion engine means greenhouse gas emissions for\nthe entire lifespan of the vehicle. But avoiding lock-in—forgoing a further\ncommitment to a now-undesirable system—is genuinely hard, because it’s what\ncurrently works best. It means pulling yourself out of the sticky entangled\nspider-web of the existing networks. I have a gas-burning car because, a\ndecade or so ago when it became clear I needed a new one, there wasn’t enough\ncharging infrastructure to make relying on an electric vehicle feasible,\nespecially since I’m a “garage orphan,” without a dedicated parking space\nwhere I could charge it. But the reason I needed a new car _at all_ was\nbecause of the absence of public transit options.\n\nEvery infrastructural system I’ve described in this book, whether public or\nprivate, exists because of specific decisions about the ultrastructure—who\npays for what, who owns it, how it’s regulated, what negative externalities\nare permitted. Once it exists, it has the incumbent’s advantage. The purpose\nof every oil and gas distribution system, every pipeline and pumping station,\nis to make it easier and cheaper to burn fossil fuels, which makes it that\nmuch harder to do anything else. It’s one of the reasons for strong community\nopposition to new facilities. If recommitting to existing systems is the path\nof least resistance—all of the technologies, systems, and standards are\nalready in place to smooth the way—then conversely, transitions to new systems\ndon’t just happen. This is where governmental policies at all levels,\nincluding regulations and financial subsidies such as grants and tax\nincentives, have played and continue to play a role. Especially for\nindividuals and households, community education and support can help bridge\nthe gap between the present, where the incumbent options might still have the\nupper hand in price or convenience, and a future where new options become the\nnew default.\n\nFinally, it doesn’t make sense to build out huge new systems intended to last\nfor a long time if the technologies, the systems, and communities they are\nembedded in are all evolving rapidly. New systems should be smaller scale by\ndefault, rather than monolithic, providing opportunities to test-drive systems\nwithin particular communities and conditions, and to explore approaches that\nmight be temporary or which serve as a seedbed for more change. In many\ncities, this included the experimentation with urban space during the first\nyear or so of the global coronavirus pandemic, closing streets to cars and\nbuilding out additional bike lanes. It might be trial runs of bus routes or\non-demand mobility within public transport, like microbuses.\n\nThinking about infrastructural systems as flexible and exploratory goes\nagainst the dominant paradigm of these systems as robust, stable, and big,\nserving a large area and a commensurately high number of people. But at the\nsame time, the nature of standards and networks means that some important\nsystems are inherently modular, made up of connected parts. The Internet is\nthe canonical example of this, as a network that is decentralized but\nfederated. A “smart grid” for electricity would be a similar model for power:\ninstead of a few large sources (like power plants) and many consumers, it’s a\nmodel where the network consists of a wide array of electricity generation,\nconsumers, and storage, of varying sizes. The “smart” in “smart grid” is\nbecause this approach depends on sensors and computation—a more granular\nunderstanding of what the power is doing, and where—not least because of the\nchallenges associated with making decisions within the vastly increased\ncomplexity of distributed energy generation and provision.\n\nInfrastructural systems, particularly energy systems, that are designed to\nmake the most of specific local resources to meet local needs can help to\nsidestep some of the immediate issues around materials extraction and\nfabrication. A world in which lithium batteries are the only way to store\nenergy looks very different from the one where communities use a wide range of\napproaches to generate and store power, whether it’s gravity batteries,\nhydroelectric storage, geothermal, or whatever else.\n\nFinally, infrastructural systems that are decentralized but federated embody a\nmodel of mutual aid, distinct from top-down provision, and control. The\nmodularization and connectivity of infrastructural systems, together with the\ninherently distributed and decentralized access to renewable energy, also\nmeans that it’s possible to begin the transformation of different systems in\ndifferent ways all over and all at once. This heuristic doesn’t only apply to\nthe technological aspects of infrastructural systems. Flexible, distributed\ninfrastructural systems suggest a similar diffusion of political and decision-\nmaking power, devolving it to smaller communities. Resisting the consolidation\nof smaller systems into larger ones pushes back on the concentration of\nresources, capital, and control. What it means to be small and flexible, or\nexploratory, or temporary, or decentralized will vary according to the\nspecific situation, but this heuristic is about actively making decisions that\nfavor localization, distribution of resources, and cooperation.\n\n## 4\\. Move Toward an Ethics of Care\n\nNearly the entire history of infrastructural systems is one of using land and\nresources to create benefits for groups of people, of unprecedented comfort\nand agency, and simultaneously one of diffusing and displacing harms and\nnegative consequences to other communities and places, of sacrifice zones and\norganized abandonment. The animating principle behind this pattern has been\nutilitarianism born of real or perceived scarcity—that meeting the needs and\ndesires of the many outweighs the costs borne by a few—coupled with an\naccounting of those costs that was colored by racism and othering. In these\naccountings, Indigenous or African American communities were less valuable\nthan predominantly White communities, the role of colonies was to support\ninfrastructural provision in the metropole, and health risks were more\nacceptable for lower-income communities than for wealthier ones. When the U.S.\nSupreme Court ruled that the Tuscarora Nation would lose part of their land to\na reservoir, the court meant to ensure that the millions of residents of New\nYork City had a steady supply of hydroelectric power—a utilitarian decision.\n\nTwo centuries after the birth of modern infrastructural systems, we recognize\nthat they are a key component of the way that we take care of each other, and\nwe can reject the idea that some lives and ways of life are more worthy than\nothers. Instead of utilitarianism, then, we can draw on a different operative\nmoral framework: the ethics of care. Rather than the abstract idea of\nmaximizing good, caring is a result of compassion and relationships. Ethical\ncare means being attentive and responsive to what’s needed, recognizing that\nthose needs vary; it requires taking on responsibility to participate in that\ncare and doing so in a competent way; and it requires communication, trust,\nand respect. Thinking about infrastructural systems in these terms is\nfundamentally different from the accounting-sheet approach of utilitarianism.\nLike infrastructure itself, an ethics of care is collective and relational,\nwhich also makes it consistent with infrastructure as a public good, not as\nprivate provision or individual responsibility.\n\nBuilding on an ethics of care rather than utilitarianism as a heuristic for\nmaking collective decisions about infrastructure has immediate, practical\napplications. An ethics of care approach lends itself to reducing inequality\nbecause it recognizes and responds to a range of needs, whether it’s at the\nscale of a neighborhood, a country, or the planet. It rightly puts the\nemphasis on the most vulnerable and marginalized communities that historically\nhave been the most underserved or have borne a disproportionate share of the\ncosts associated with infrastructure. Imagine if we decided that any\ninfrastructural provision that’s noisy, noxious, or even just unsightly had to\nbe built in the wealthiest neighborhoods. How would that change what we build?\nWe know the answer to this: the harms would be mitigated.\n\nThinking about infrastructure through this lens of caregiving also puts\noperations and maintenance, not innovation, at the center. All of these\nsystems only continue to function reliably because they are themselves cared\nfor, with time, energy, skills, and resources keeping them running. The\ntransformation of infrastructural systems means there’ll be no shortage of\nribbon-cutting ceremonies for new facilities, but we also need to recognize,\nplan, and budget for their ongoing care, especially the necessary human labor.\n\n## 5\\. Recognize, Prioritize, and Defend Nonmonetary Benefits\n\nIt’s impossible to put a dollar value on clean water, or electricity, or even\ntelecommunications or transportation. We are each more than our economic\ncapacity and we all have the right to receive the benefits of full societal\nand civic participation, regardless of whether or not we can produce value as\nworkers. And infrastructural systems, as network monopolies, are not market\ngoods, much less luxuries that we can defer or decide against purchasing. On\nthe provision side, wholesale electricity costs soar during periods of high\ndemand like heatwaves or winter freezes because everyone involved understands\nthat avoiding the true cost of blackouts, in suffering and excess deaths, is\nworth nearly any price. But without the preparation, skills, and resources to\nact in the physical world, no amount of money can unstick a frozen gas valve\nor reboot a transformer damaged by a solar storm. This tells us that it’s not\nenough to think about the costs, benefits, and operations of infrastructural\nsystems only in economic terms. We need to accept this up front and act\naccordingly, which means being able to recognize, articulate, prioritize, and\ndefend the nonmonetary benefits of these systems.\n\nMany infrastructural systems are public goods in both the economic and\neveryday sense of the phrase, loaded with positive externalities and\nnonmonetary value, and we all benefit if these systems are genuinely\nrecognized and treated as what they are. Because all infrastructural systems\nare embedded in and draw from the world around them, any conception of these\nsystems as public goods needs to go hand in hand with mitigating harms to\nother public goods and common-pool resources, including environments and\necosystems from the local to the global.\n\nDefending the public good extends into the future. In my required engineering\neconomics course, I was taught how to calculate the time value of money,\nquantifying how it’s worth the most if it’s in your bank account today and\nless and less the further away it is. My colleague Alison told me about\nlearning, as a PhD student in civil engineering, that the Bureau of\nReclamation had plans in the 1960s to dam part of the Grand Canyon to make\nhydroelectricity. The logic was purely financial: the sale of power would\ncover the cost of construction and then be a source of revenue, and\nforeseeable profits in the near future would be preferable to the uncertain or\nlimited economic benefits of an empty canyon. With a strictly economic\nviewpoint, leaving anything on the table today—any resources unextracted—is a\nlost opportunity. To capitalism, sustainability always looks like\nunderutilization. But the plan to dam the Grand Canyon was on the syllabus so\nthe students could see the limitations of _only_ doing the cost-benefit\nanalysis. What actually happened, Alison said, was that “conservationists put\nup a hell of a fight.” Led by the Sierra Club, which ran full-page ads in\nnewspapers including _The New York Times_ and _Los Angeles Times_ with\nheadlines like if they can turn the Grand Canyon into a “cash register,” is\nany national park safe? You know the answer, the campaign roused huge public\nsupport for continuing to protect the region in perpetuity, and the Grand\nCanyon dam was scrapped.\n\nNonmonetary costs and benefits can be highly asymmetric. Entropy increases;\nthe universe tends toward disorder. From an energy and materials point of\nview, it’s almost always easier to avoid damaging air, water, and ecosystems\nthan it is to remediate them after the fact. Unpolluting is a lot harder than\npolluting! Even though natural systems can be surprisingly resilient,\nrecovering rapidly once humans leave them alone, that doesn’t mean that they\naren’t damaged in the meantime. I’m optimistic that humans will get better at\nrestoring ecosystems, including one day even taking on incredibly energy-\nintensive, long, slow processes like sieving microplastics out of the oceans.\nBut replaced, rebuilt, or remediated is not the same thing as never damaged in\nthe first place, and some damage, like the extinction of species, is likely to\nbe genuinely irrecoverable. Articulating nonmonetary costs is part of how to\nget to mitigating harms rather than just considering them to be acceptable\ncollateral damage.\n\nA heuristic, then, is refusing to let money set the entire terms for the\ndiscussion and decision-making around infrastructural systems, and instead\nvoicing the entire broader context—nonmonetary benefits and harms, positive\nand negative externalities including environmental impacts, and a\nconsideration of how these extend into the future.\n\n## 6\\. Make It Public\n\nNetworked infrastructural systems that meet human needs, whether survival or\nsocial, are fundamentally incompatible with private investment and profit. As\nnatural monopolies, they’re rife with the potential for abuse since their\ncustomers are a captive market who always need access to their “product” and\nwho don’t have the power to individually negotiate the price, quality, or\nother characteristics of provision. Since the earliest days of networked\ninfrastructure, investor-held companies have wanted to be in the game because\nit promised guaranteed revenue at a minimum, and usually also the ability to\nmaximize profit by raising prices. It’s why many early private providers were\nfolded into public systems, and one of the main reasons why utilities, whether\npublic or private, are heavily regulated (which means, of course, that the\ncost of oversight is transferred to the public purse).\n\nInfrastructural systems also rely on common-pool resources. Throughout human\nhistory, communities have successfully managed their commons through\ncommunication and cooperation, but infrastructure providers have every\nincentive to exploit these resources for short-term private profit, both\nthrough resource extraction and by sloughing the nonmonetary costs and\nnegative externalities of this systems off to the larger population. And they\nhave. We’ve heard this story over and over again in the history of\ninfrastructure and through to the present day. Most pollution falls into this\ncategory: the contamination of public water supplies with chemicals, air\npollution around refineries and roads, the ubiquity of plastic waste, or\ncountless other examples, even light pollution in the night sky from fleets of\nlow Earth orbit communication satellites. This misalignment of incentives also\nmeans that no amount of regulation and oversight can fully compensate for the\ncontinuous pressure, insidious if not obvious, to prioritize activities that\nwill provide profits for investors and to minimize costs that don’t have an\nobvious return, which includes maintenance. The economic impact of\nexternalities and failures falls on users and taxpayers, but because these are\ninfrastructural systems, those risks and harms are more than just\nfinancial—they encompass the life, health, and well-being of you, me, everyone\nwe know, and, with pollution and greenhouse gases, all living creatures on our\nplanet.\n\nThe issues with infrastructure-for-profit become even more profound if we look\ntoward what it will take to have functioning infrastructural systems for the\nnext century or so. To begin with, no corporation has any interest in the\nwell-being of our descendants twenty or fifty or a hundred years from now,\neven as potential customers, because the profit motive is fundamentally\nincompatible with long-term thinking. Investor-owned companies have no\ninterest in creating nonmonetary benefits or positive externalities, other\nthan incidentally, and they are incentivized to ignore negative externalities\nexcept when legally required to address them. Profit-seeking is at odds with\nmaintenance and reliability in the present, and it’ll be incompatible with\nresilience and sustainability in the future. To take an obvious example:\nprivate power utilities have no intrinsic incentive to sell _less_ power,\nwhich means that they have little interest in efficiency, much less in\ndistributed renewable energy generation like rooftop solar. The same things\nthat make renewable energy so promising for us as a species—that it’s both\nabundant and intrinsically cheaper than energy from fossil fuels—will make new\nfacilities less and less profitable to build. We’re already starting to see\nthis: abundant solar power has begun to result in cheap electricity, which is\nconsidered to be a problem for private investment (because that energy can’t\nbe sold for a profit) instead of an incredible win for consumers and for\nsociety at large.\n\nWell-crafted and -enforced regulations are intended to align corporate\nbehavior with the interests of humans, but the last half century or so of\nprivatized power, water, and telecommunications, in the U.S. and elsewhere,\nhas made clear that they are simply no match for the corrosive incentives of\nprofit. So rather than using regulations as an arm’s-length tool of corporate\noversight, essential infrastructural systems should be funded and managed as\ncommunity-owned systems. If they can only be made profitable through the\nexploitation of consumers, then they should instead be treated as what they\nare, an investment in the public good. If they’re only profitable because the\ncosts of environmental, social, and other harms are externalized rather than\nconsidered and addressed, including those resulting from insufficient\nmaintenance, then those “profits” need to go toward mitigating those harms\ninstead of to shareholders. For all the manifold ways that public\ninfrastructure has fallen short in the past two centuries, there is at least a\ntrajectory toward incorporating these broader ideals. Only community-led\nnetworks, whether publicly owned or non-profit cooperatives, even have the\npotential to incorporate broad-based accountability, long-term thinking, and\nan ethos of meeting needs. And if it’s possible to have a well-functioning\nutility provider that serves all residents equitably, that’s embedded in a\nhealthy environment, and still turns a profit? All the more reason for it to\nbe public.\n\nTransforming infrastructural systems to be resilient and sustainable is\npossible, but it won’t be easy. It’ll require the build-out of new facilities\nand systems, and will involve the development of new technologies, all of\nwhich will require an investment of money and resources. Technological\nprogress is often thought of as spontaneous and unstoppable, as new\ntechnologies emerge in response to unfilled needs or unconsummated desires.\nBut there is almost always one specific criterion that’s met, even if it’s\nimplicit, and it’s this: Someone will make a return on their investment. The\nnew technology will be profitable. Communities including the Amish and\nMennonites are often portrayed as anti-technology, but that’s not exactly\ntrue. What makes them distinct is that they have an intentionally applied set\nof criteria for what technologies are adopted, based on the impact to the\ncommunity. Even the Luddites objected to textile machinery not because it was\nnew but because the textile mills meant that control of worker labor, and the\nprofits it generated, was concentrated in the hands of the factory owners.\n\nIf the society-wide transformation of infrastructural systems to make them\nsustainable and resilient is driven by what rewards private investment, it’ll\nbe harder to do and we’ll miss out on opportunities. If every personal vehicle\nwere to be replaced with an electric equivalent, for example, it would require\na huge investment in new cars and would spur the development of related\ntechnologies. Now instead, consider building out (or simply growing) public\ntransportation alternatives to driving. They might require a similar total\ninvestment and have a similar impact on the economy, but this investment would\nbe collective rather than individual. Public transport has a host of other\nbenefits—safer roads and mobility options for a broader range of people,\nincluding the young, the elderly, and others who might not be able to drive,\nas well as everyone who might struggle to afford to purchase and maintain a\ncar. But it’s not either/or, it’s both/and, not least because electric\nvehicles are subsidized by grants, tax credits, and public charging stations,\nall of which are another way of collectively investing in a transition, but\nones that don’t open up those new possibilities for collective benefits. To\nhave infrastructural networks that are resilient, equitable, and sustainable,\nwe need to consider a broader set of criteria for the systems and technologies\nthan the possibility of private profit.\n\nThe main difference between investor-owned and community-led infrastructure\nisn’t about the investment itself: it’s that the first centralizes the\nfinancial benefits—the profits—to a small group and the latter leads to more\ndiffuse benefits. The costs of operating and maintaining infrastructure are an\nexpense, or even a loss, from the point of view of a company balance sheet and\nits investors, but they aren’t to the community—those funds are reinvested in\nthe economy through salaries and supply purchases, in addition to all the\nbenefits of having well-maintained infrastructure. And high-quality\ninfrastructure is what enables economic agency and civic participation. The\nsame is true of mitigating pollution or other environmental impacts, with the\nadded benefits of a cleaner environment, and it’s especially true of\ninvestments made to safeguard these systems into the future. But these\ndecentralized, diffuse benefits are hard to advocate for, for exactly that\nreason. They don’t lend themselves to lobby groups, paid for by the profits\nfrom building out new systems. They’re what we, collectively and through our\nrepresentatives, need to argue for, defend, and protect.\n\nEconomists don’t agree on much, but there is a general consensus that public\ninfrastructure investments can pay for themselves, because any debts that\nmight result will be offset by the increase in economic capacity. This has\nalways been the argument for public investment in infrastructure: what the\npeople of a community or a country can do—and what companies can do and\nsell—is enabled, shaped, and limited by the nature and quality of the\ninfrastructural services that are available. And that’s only the financial\nvalue of infrastructural investment. It doesn’t capture the enormous\nnonmonetary benefits of resilient, sustainable, equitable infrastructural\nprovision. A similar calculation holds true for our response to climate\nchange—the estimated cost of building out systems to transition away from\nfossil fuel consumption and to safeguard our communities will be much less\nthan the cost of not doing so. Once we recognize that these are investments\nworth making, there are two immediate corollaries. The first is that there are\nno isolated nodes. Every community is part of a larger social and economic\nfabric, and so the local tax base and resources can’t be the primary driver of\nwhether or not its residents have access to well-functioning infrastructural\nsystems. The second is that, since these infrastructural systems (and other\npublic and common-pool resources) are what make economic activity possible at\nall, this needs to be reflected in tax structures and policies, particularly\ncorporate taxation. Those funds need to be reinvested back into these common\nsystems.\n\nIn practice, what this means is refusing to let public systems like municipal\nwater supplies be put into private hands. It means working to regain public or\ncommunity ownership of privatized systems, or it means building out public\nalternatives to supplant them, like community broadband to replace private\nInternet providers. Funding and tax incentives should prioritize co-ops and\nother alternatives, instead of serving as a means to funnel public money into\nexisting companies and simply strengthening their network monopolies. It might\nmean incorporating handover terms, where after a certain amount of time, a\nprivate investment (like a toll highway) becomes publicly owned and operated.\nIt also means avoiding large-scale, capital-intensive facilities in favor of\nsmall-scale but federated systems, like microgrids. It means actively working\nagainst centralization of systems and capital, and it means building and\ndefending community-led, care-first infrastructural systems. There is\nabsolutely no shortage of meaningful work that needs to be done, and there is\nno shortage of resources with which to do it. The only questions are who will\ndo it, under what terms, and what the resulting world will look like.\n\n## Transforming Infrastructure Is Transforming Culture\n\nThese six precepts about infrastructural systems are heuristics, not an\nalgorithm or a checklist, because there never is and never will be a one-size-\nfits-all solution. They’re tools for thinking about infrastructure, ideas of\nwhat to be working toward and how, as a guide for decision-making over the\nwide range of situations found in different geographic, political, economic,\nand physical contexts. These decisions are as much social as they are\ntechnical: what we spend our money on, who benefits, and who decides. There\nare often going to be conflicts, and balancing the contradictions is going to\nbe a large part of the work. But we also don’t have to try to find the perfect\nanswer; we just need to have some drive toward finding better answers, not\nworse ones. I’m heartened by the large number of committed activists who are\nconsistently applying this pressure and the smart folks in policy who are\nfiguring out ways to support it.\n\nFor our infrastructural systems to be truly sustainable, we need more than the\ntechnologies and the resources to build out new systems. We need these new\nways of thinking about them. When I see a framework like Kaba’s, of working\ntoward large-scale transformation by carrying out actions in the short,\nmedium, and long term and at the individual, institutional, and societal\nlevel, I immediately envision it as a three-by-three grid and start figuring\nout what could be placed in each square. So, for example, when I think about\nelectricity provision in the medium term, I think about how solar panels, home\nbatteries, and electric vehicles provide resilience at the individual or\nhousehold level. At the regional scale, grid-scale batteries can be used to\nsmooth out variations in supply to match demand. And the community-scale\nversion of this? Local centers of renewable power generation and storage that\ncan serve as community hubs in an emergency.\n\nBut one key idea here is that all of these things can happen simultaneously,\nat all these scales, all over. My graduate work in engineering was in\nmaterials science. It’s the study of how the physical properties of solid\nmatter result from its underlying structures, from the atomic level on up,\nincluding the way those structures interact with energy. We’re in contact with\nmaterials virtually every moment of our lives and so we have a profound\nempirical understanding of their behavior, but materials science provides a\nconceptual framework for understanding why they behave the way they do, and\nreveals the deep connections that underpin their properties. Why are metals\nshiny, and why do they conduct electricity? Why do some solids melt when\nthey’re heated, some soften, and some burn? Why can we immediately distinguish\nbetween clear plastic and glass just by touching them? My long engagement with\nembodiment, materiality, and energy colors how I think about infrastructural\nsystems. We also interact with them continuously, with a deep understanding of\nhow they work based on a lifetime of experience. Materials and infrastructure\nare both trans-scalar—the way they behave arises from structures across a wide\nspan of sizes, up to the very large for infrastructure and down to the very\nsmall for materials. One of the reasons why teaching introductory materials\nscience is so much fun is because it’s like giving my students X-ray vision. I\ncan hand them a paper clip to pull open and bend back and forth, and they can\nfeel the wire getting harder and harder to bend before it eventually breaks.\nUnderstanding why this is happening is like “seeing” what the metal atoms are\ndoing inside the wire in response to the forces we are applying with our\nhands. This particular phenomenon is known as “work hardening,” and it occurs\nwhen metal is bent or shaped without heating it up. Solid metal, like the\npaper clip, is made up of tiny grains of ordered atoms, in the same way a\nsnowball is made up of individual tiny water crystals packed together. You\nmight have seen this as “spangle” on exposed air ducts in buildings or the\ncrossbars of a chain-link fence, where the zinc coating of galvanized steel\nforms large grains on the surface, but otherwise the metal crystals are\nusually only visible under a microscope, and then only on samples that have\nbeen cut, polished, and carefully etched to reveal their internal structure. A\npiece of metal that is cold-worked—whether hammered, or drawn into wire, or\notherwise deformed, like bending the paper clip—retains this microscopic\nstructure, but it invisibly accumulates internal stresses between the\nconstituent atoms, which begin to resist moving around. This resistance is\nwhat we feel as we push harder with our fingers to get the wire to bend, and\nit’s why it eventually just breaks. But if that heavily stressed piece of\nmetal is put into a furnace and held at an elevated temperature, something\nremarkable happens. By providing them with _some_ energy, in the form of heat,\nthe atoms gain a tiny bit of freedom to move around. The metal remains solid\nand from the outside it looks the same But inside, the atoms start to shift to\nrelieve the stress that they’re under, just slightly. What happens next is\nastonishing. All through the metal, the atoms spontaneously nucleate _new_\ncrystal structures. First, tiny dots of seed crystals appear everywhere in the\nmetal, all at once, and then they grow and combine and grow as more and more\natoms align themselves with the new configurations, and eventually the new\ncrystals completely replace the original, heavily damaged microscopic grains.\nFrom the outside, the metal looks the same as it did before. But inside, the\ninterior has recrystallized and rebuilt itself into a completely new\nstructure, without ever breaking the cohesion that holds it together. And this\nnew pattern is no longer stressed and brittle. Instead, it’s strong and\nresilient.\n\nThis recrystallization of cold-worked metal atoms is my mental model for how\nwe can transform and recommit to our infrastructural systems. We all live\nembedded within global networks, but they’ve been stressed and damaged and are\nfacing more of the same. We want to rebuild these systems, everywhere and all\nat once, in a way that repairs that damage and relieves those stresses but\nwithout passing through atomization, without falling apart. The way this can\nhappen is by local, distributed changes within the larger systems, keeping the\nconnections between them intact as we reshape the systems and replace them\nwith something new. Rather than a top-down replacement, this means giving\nindividual communities the agency and energy—the tools and resources—to\nreorganize these systems at a local level. This means figuring out how to\ninvest at all levels, making decisions about what length scales to build new\nsystems on, and figuring out which regulations and legislation will need to be\nunwound and which new policies will need to be created. This work is underway\nin many places, but there’s an enormous amount yet to be done. It’s also going\nto be a new kind of work for many of us.\n\nIn order to have functional, resilient, sustainable infrastructure for\nourselves and our descendants, we have to practice our relationship to each\nother at all length scales. At small scales that might be community—the people\nyou are closest to, people who look like you or talk like you or have values\nsimilar to yours. But most of these systems, especially in the U.S., have been\nbuilt out with the explicit intention of having some groups or places benefit\nwhile the costs are borne by other people and places. So there’s also an\nelement of solidarity—of recognizing that we are all in sustained\nrelationships with all the people who _aren’t_ like us, because\ninfrastructural systems are trans-scalar hyperobjects, with roots in the past\nand branches leading on toward our future. It means learning to stand our\ncommon ground and to defend the public good, in the face of not only those who\nwould benefit from its erosion but also those who can’t understand the value\nof defending or working toward something that might not involve direct\npersonal benefit.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that we have to solve huge, overarching issues with huge,\noverarching solutions. In fact, we need to _resist_ these sorts of solutions,\nbecause our landscapes and our technologies are in transition, so we\nabsolutely want to be able to explore, experiment with, and even roll back\nsystems as needed, and to do this in different ways in different places. What\nit does mean is that we need to be able to see and appreciate our\ninfrastructural systems, to imagine what we want them to be, and to nucleate\nchange wherever we are.\n\n\n# Eleven\n\n# Infrastructural Citizenship\n\nI went to the Hoover Dam almost by accident. I was in Salt Lake City for a\nconference, and I decided to take a few days afterward to visit Zion and Bryce\nCanyon National Parks, both a few hours south of the city. The last afternoon\nof the conference, I picked up a rental car, loaded my bags, and headed south.\nThere was a wildfire just off Interstate 15 and when I stopped for gas, I took\na photo of an American flag, illuminated by the dusky orange sun and against a\ndark background of smoke. I started to pass signs reading lake mead recreation\narea and realized something I hadn’t before: Lake Mead is the reservoir that\nstretches behind the Hoover Dam, and the signage meant that I might be close\nenough to visit. When I checked into my hotel outside of Zion National Park\nthat evening, I looked at a map and worked out that I could go visit the dam\nas a day trip, at least in the very western-U.S. sense—at 175 miles away, it’d\nclock in at about five and a half hours of driving to get there and back. I\nbooked a tour, put together a bag for the road, set my alarm for five o’clock\nthe next morning, and went to bed.\n\nI’d been to the Hoover Dam decades before, during my very first trip to the\nAmerican southwest, when a friend had convinced me to come with him to Las\nVegas for a few days. We stayed in the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel, one of the\nmany carefully designed synthetic casino ecosystems lining the Strip, each\nalive with the trills and beeps of slot machines and flashing lights. He’d\nrented a convertible for a day and we drove first to the Hoover Dam and then\nto the Grand Canyon, away from the sensory overload of the city and out into\nthe vastness of the desert. We didn’t have time to do much more than gawk at\nthe dam and then to stand and marvel from the nearest point on the canyon rim.\nBy the end of the day, I knew I wanted to return and, while I’d already had my\nlifetime’s fill of the Strip, that meant that some day I’d be back to Las\nVegas, as an entry point to get back out to the Grand Canyon and the Hoover\nDam. And at seven that morning, there I was. I stopped at a Venezuelan café\nfor breakfast and headed back out of the city.\n\nI had planned my early start in order to arrive at the dam as soon as they\nopened to visitors. Even at nine thirty in the morning, the July sun was high\nand bright, and the desert was golden under a brilliant blue sky. As I drove\ntoward the dam, I noticed the line of electricity transmission towers and was\nmomentarily startled when I arrived at the parking area and saw the nearest\npylon—the power lines dive down to the turbines at the base of the dam, so it\nextends out almost horizontally from the edge of the valley wall and looks for\nall the world like it’s caught in the moment of tumbling into the river. The\nHoover Dam itself, familiar from so many movies, was a curving wall rising up\nfrom the valley floor, with the blue of Lake Mead behind it and huge spillways\non either side. If the reservoir is full to capacity, the spillways prevent it\nfrom overflowing by diverting water—each can carry the volume of Niagara\nFalls—around the dam and to the river below. They’ve only been used twice,\nonce as a test shortly after they were constructed and once in 1983.\n\nDeep in the interior of the dam, the generators in the turbine room were\nsilent that morning, as the demand for electricity was met elsewhere. While it\nwas only a distant possibility when the facility was built, ongoing droughts\nin the Southwest could result in the water level dropping below the intake\nvalves for the turbines, making them unusable. Whether or not Lake Mead\nbecomes a “dead pool,” the Colorado River will eventually silt up the\nreservoir, ending the facility’s functional lifetime. But the dam itself—the\nconcrete gravity arch structure in the desert—will last effectively forever.\n\nAfter the tour, I took the elevator from the base of the dam back up to the\nvisitor areas at the top. In the years since I first visited, I’ve seen many\nmore infrastructural facilities, so I was newly surprised by just how _fancy_\neverything is. Everywhere you look there is high Art Deco detailing, in brass\nand stone. There are clocktowers at each end of the dam to show the time in\nArizona and in Nevada, since the state and time-zone borders run along the\nColorado River (although the hour hands were in the same position that summer\nday, because Arizona doesn’t observe daylight saving time). Even the public\nrestroom at the Hoover Dam felt like it was in a theater or an opera house, a\npowder room–type space on the lower level with a glorious, hand-laid terrazzo\nfloor and a spiral staircase leading up to the facilities. It’s a very similar\naesthetic to the Empire State Building, which had been built just a few years\nearlier than the dam, but that was a commercial building in a thriving\nmetropolis. The Hoover Dam is, well, a _dam_ —a utilitarian structure that\nimpounds water and generates electricity, in the middle of the desert, built\nby the federal government.\n\nBack outside, the red hand of a tower-mounted thermometer was spun most of the\nway around its dial, reading a scorching 45 degrees Celsius and 112 degrees\nFahrenheit under the blazing desert sun. I walked over to Monument Plaza, my\nattention drawn by the two winged figures in green-patinaed bronze, each\nthirty feet high, and read the nearby plaque dedicated to the hundred or so\nmen killed during the dam’s construction: “They died to make the desert\nbloom.” Under my feet was another clock, for which the mechanism is the\ngradually changing orientation of Earth in space. Into the terrace around the\nsculpture, artist Oskar J. W. Hansen embedded a precise schematic of what the\nstars and planets in the night sky looked like in 1935, when the dam was\nopened and dedicated. There’s a pointer to Polaris, which, as the North Star,\nsits at the fixed point in the sky that the rest of the stars appear to\nrevolve around. But that point isn’t truly fixed. Because Earth precesses on\nits north-south axis, the North Pole traces out a circle in space and the star\nthat the axis “points to” changes over time. It’s Polaris today, but 4,500\nyears ago, when the ancient Egyptians built the Great Pyramids, the axis\npointed to Thuban, an inconspicuous binary star system. Twelve millennia from\nnow, the North Star will be bright Vega. All three are marked on the star map,\nmaking it into a clockface that tells the time within this twenty-six-\nthousand-year cycle of axial precession. It’s a message to the far future, to\nanyone here in this place and observing the remnants of the dam, even twenty\nmillennia from now. Hansen’s art makes the Hoover Dam one of the few pieces of\npublic infrastructure I know of that explicitly recognizes an impact on\ntimescales that go far beyond a single human life. It’s an infrastructural\nfacility not just as charismatic mega-engineering but as monument.\n\nPart of why I wasn’t impressed by my hotel in Las Vegas was because I’d\nalready been to its inspiration and namesake. I have a set of framed photos\nthat I took when I visited Egypt, including one of the Great Sphinx at Giza\nand another of the Ramesseum, in Luxor, whose toppled granite figures inspired\nPercy Bysshe Shelley to write “Ozymandias”:\n\n> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\n>\n> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\n>\n> The lone and level sands stretch far away.\n\nLess than two hundred miles away from the Hoover Dam is a bristlecone pine\ntree in the Mojave Desert that germinated before the Great Pyramid was built\nat Giza, almost five thousand years ago. A hundred or so miles north of that\ntree is King Clone, a ring of self-cloning creosote bushes estimated to be\nabout twelve thousand years old. On my drive south from Salt Lake City, I\npassed the town of Richfield, home of “Pando,” a grove of nearly fifty\nthousand quaking aspens, in which the trees are genetically identical to each\nother and share a single root system. While the earliest trees are long gone,\nthe grove is estimated to be thousands of years old, possibly dating as far\nback as the last ice age. All of these long-lived organisms are embedded in\ntheir larger ecosystems, which endure even as they respond to the weather, to\nthe seasons, to gradual shifts in climate and even geology—to everything, in\nfact, except for the scale and rapidity of human activity.\n\nWe expect our infrastructural systems to endure as well, to be there for us\nday after day, providing the technological bedrock of our lives. But instead\nof building out these facilities as monuments like the Hoover Dam, we have the\nopportunity to think of them as ecosystems, like forests. The exact nature of\na forest is specific to the local conditions and resources, from the tropical\nforests of Borneo to the taiga of the subarctic. And while a forest as a whole\nis coherent in time and space, with continuity and longevity, any individual\nelement that it comprises—every insect, bird, mammal, plant, tree, and\nfungus—grows, lives, and dies according to its time. A forest is about the\n_relationship_ between the elements, and the systems and benefits that result\nare a product of the forest in its entirety. A forest is sustainable because\nit’s self-renewing and doesn’t produce waste; whatever falls or dies decays\nand provides nutrients for new growth.\n\nThis is our aspirational model for infrastructure. Like forests, our\ninfrastructural systems now have the potential to be modular, networked,\ndecentralized, responsive, and resilient. Instead of a few monumental\ninstallations, they could be distributed and locally specific. And above all,\nthey can be sustainable, cradle-to-cradle systems, using energy inputs to\ncreate closed loops for materials rather than to dig linear cycles of\nextraction and waste ever deeper. There’s a theory that the reason why we\nhaven’t yet observed any signs of extraterrestrial life is because\ncivilizations are faced with an existential choice: either learn to live\nsustainably, in harmony with their environment, or die. Being “loud”—sending\nlots of energy or matter wastefully out into space—is a signature of a linear\neconomy. Sustainable societies are quiet.\n\n## The Social Grid, and Care at Scale\n\nIt’s possible to buy some land, build out solar panels, dig a well, install a\ngraywater recycling system, plant crops—a sort of twenty-first century\nhomesteading. My colleague Ben Linder and his partner, Connie, are carrying\nout this sort of transformation of their home on a pleasant street in suburban\nBoston, as a way of increasing their resilience and sustainability at the\nhousehold level. I know folks who live farther afield, off the electrical grid\nand without immediate neighbors. But their homes aren’t bunkers—far from it.\nThe self-sufficiency of a bunker implies (and is motivated by) social as well\nas technological disconnection. That untethering might be externally imposed,\nas by a disaster, or it might be voluntary. In contrast, the self-sufficiency\nof a home like Ben’s is deeply relational and embedded in a social grid, just\naround a different web of technologies. Whether we’re on the grid or off it,\nwe’re all reliant on those around us. In part this is because virtually\neverything we use, from modern medical care to copper wiring, was made by or\nrequires the expertise of many, many people, the result in part of the vastly\nincreased technological complexity of the last century. None of us have the\nwide-ranging expertise to make the artifacts and systems that we rely on to\nsurvive. But even without that, a twenty-first century homestead is on a\ntwenty-first century planet, embedded not only in global networks of resources\nbut also in the landscape, with all the changes that it’s absorbed and is\ncontinuing to absorb—pollution, climate change, food systems. And it’s not\npossible to wind back the clock.\n\nAs long as we have bodies, we’ll be in a sustained relationship with the\npeople around us. Even if it’s on smaller scales of distance and time, shared\ninfrastructure involves being in an ongoing relationship with other people,\none that you can’t (or can’t easily) walk away from. It takes commitment,\nnegotiation, and compromise to navigate the different things that we might\nwant, and the desires and values that they represent, together with those\naround us. We’ve _never_ lived socially independent lives—if there is a\ndefining feature of our species, it might be that we transmit culture even\nwithout direct body-to-body interaction, by drawing it on a cave wall or\nbeaming it out over the airwaves or putting it in writing to be recopied and\nshared down the decades or centuries. Being alone is like eating only uncooked\nfood—you can do it and survive, but cooked food is the human universal. Not\nfor nothing have we built out communication and transportations systems to\nlive our lives alongside other people.\n\nThe converse is also true: we bear some responsibility for the people with\nwhom we are in sustained relationships. As a Canadian by birth and a\nnaturalized American, this is how I think about citizenship. I don’t just get\na set of rights. It comes with responsibilities to other Canadians and\nAmericans, no matter where we all live and even if we never interact with each\nother, just by virtue of our being part of the same polity. But since\ncitizenship also carries with it the right to live indefinitely within\nnational borders, that means our bodies are mostly in spaces where they\ninteract with each other—neighborhoods, cities, watersheds, ecosystems,\nstates, the country, the continent. Especially because our infrastructure is\nsuch an important way in which we take care of each other, at scale, it’s easy\nto conflate them, but there are two separate relationships here, one political\nand one spatial. The spatial relationship has nothing to do with being\ncitizens, or taxpayers, or even long-term residents of a particular place.\nIt’s just about being present.\n\nWhat’s more, infrastructural systems shape the relationships that we have with\npeople who will be in these places in the future, and the relationships they\nmight have with each other, just like these systems shape our relationships\ntoday. Decisions made, facilities designed, and systems built decades ago\nenable or constrain our daily lives, by making certain possibilities easier or\nmore likely and others harder or impossible. If Boston’s Southwest Expressway\nhad been built fifty years ago, instead of being stopped by community\nopposition, odds are that I would drive on it to work every day. The decisions\nthat we make about infrastructure today—the systems that we decide are\n“normal”—will in turn shape the lives and choices of people who are not yet\nborn, our collective future. Whether it’s a new pipeline or a mandate that new\nbuildings can’t have a natural gas connection, shaping the course of the\nfuture is literally what decisions about infrastructural systems are intended\nto do. Infrastructure is how we collectively dream about our future and then\nbring it into existence.\n\nRecognizing this responsibility to the future, potentially for many\ngenerations, means considering resilience and environmental sustainability. In\nthe U.S. and Canada, only a few kinds of institutions genuinely expect and\nplan to be around in perpetuity. Churches do, and colleges—there’s one up the\nroad from me in Cambridge that’s three and a half centuries old and counting,\nand its English antecedents are pushing a millennium. Even the tiny college\nwhere I’m a professor, which graduated its first students in the twenty-first\ncentury, plans for the long term. So do countries, even if the modern idea of\nwhat it means to be a state is only a couple of centuries old.\n\nThis idea of being in an ongoing relationship with others simply by virtue of\nhaving bodies that exist in the world and which share common needs is what I\nthink of as “infrastructural citizenship.” It’s a citizenship that encompasses\nthe people who are in a particular place in the world or connected by networks\ntoday, as well as those yet to come. It carries with it the responsibility to\nsustainably steward common-pool resources, including the environment itself,\nso that future communities can support themselves and each other so they all\ncan thrive. Infrastructural citizenship is not just care at scale, but care in\nperpetuity.\n\n## Passing Through the Veil of Ignorance\n\nThe philosopher John Rawls posited a test for any system of societal\norganization that you might devise, in the form of a thought experiment. I can\nsuggest a way of ordering society: “I shall be queen of all I survey and\neveryone will do my sensible, fair-minded, and compassionate will.” Rawls’s\ntest is this: What kind of society would you devise if you would not only have\nto live there, but you’d also have to pass through a “veil of ignorance”? That\nis, you wouldn’t know ahead of time what role you’d have in that society, or\nwhere you’d live, how wealthy you’d be, your ethnicity, gender, social status,\nor even what your idea of “the good life” might be. Even if I were sure I’d be\nan effective and benevolent dictatrix, I’d probably rethink my proposal, since\nthere’s no guarantee that I’d be the person who gets that role. But we’ve all,\nalready, passed through the veil of ignorance. None of us chose the\ncircumstances of our birth. Public infrastructural systems, with universal\nprovision, can be seen as a response to this real-life version of Rawls’s veil\nof ignorance by addressing basic needs and being available to everyone. We\ntend to think that citizenship is about roots, culture, and identity—about our\npasts—but infrastructural citizenship is about our present and our future.\nRather than being linked only to our ancestors, it’s about recognizing and\nhonoring links to our _descendants_ , not just our biological heirs but the\nheirs to place. What matters in infrastructural citizenship is where our\nbodies are today, the connections we have to those around us, and the impacts\nthat the choices we make will have on the people who live where we are in the\nfuture.\n\nThe way we live our lives isn’t a mechanism that was designed, built, and set\ninto motion, predetermined as by immutable physical laws. Even on this side of\nthe veil of ignorance we can still redesign our societies. As David Graeber\nwrote, “the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that\nwe make, and could just as easily make differently.”\n\n## The Pragmatism of Universal Abundance\n\nFor all that fossil fuels make possible, they also centralize the control of\nenergy (and along with it, wealth), making it inaccessible to most of the\npeople on the planet. My energy-intensive, technologically enabled twenty-\nfirst century lifestyle is recognizably utopian to almost all humans that have\never lived. It’s a life of peace, comfort, security, mobility, and self-\nactualization. But I don’t want to be as unusually and enormously privileged\nas I am—I want _everyone_ to have my life, not in its exact details, but in\nwhat it makes possible. Because infrastructural citizenship is planetary. It\nmight be rooted in home and neighborhood and community, but all human (and\nnonhuman) life on the planet is now entangled through these systems and, as\nwith national citizenship and restrictive borders, there is no argument that\ncan be made for why only some people deserve to have infrastructural systems\nthat support basic needs.\n\nFor wealthy, developed countries that benefited from extractive or settler\ncolonialism, dedicating resources to a global technological transformation\nmight be seen as altruism, although “reparations” would be more accurate. It’s\nalso ruthless, selfish pragmatism, because the single best way to safeguard\ntheir way of life is to ensure that everyone has access to it. As Elizabeth\nTipton Derieux wrote during World War II: “Tomorrow’s peace must be more than\nthe absence of armed conflict. It must be just, creative, and cooperative.”\nEspecially in a world of climate instability, “just, creative, and\ncooperative” is also a good description of tomorrow’s resilient, sustainable\ninfrastructure.\n\nFor the first time in human history, we are within touching distance of having\nthe technology and resources that we need for that collective, energy-mediated\nagency to be available to everyone. Leaving combustion behind and\ntransitioning to renewable sources means that energy can become a true public\ngood, with no one excluded from using it, and where using it won’t take it\naway from others. It’s true that the difficulty in seeing beyond a scarcity\nmindset has been exacerbated by those with interests in the current energy\nsystem, like oil companies. But it’s also challenging simply because a world\nin which energy abundance is possible, with everything that can follow from\nthat, is unprecedented. We did it. Now we have to believe in it.\n\n## Imagining Our Futures\n\nIn his novels _The Peripheral_ and _Agency_ , William Gibson provides a\nconceptually coherent description of a global future that I think about nearly\nevery day. His characters just call it “the jackpot”—a combination of\nworldwide climate disasters, ecological catastrophes, pandemics, economic\ncrises, and large-scale sociopolitical unrest that together amounted to a\ndistributed, decentralized, slow-motion apocalypse. The scariest part of his\nportrayal of civilization-wide collapse is that we are recognizably within it,\nand have been for decades. We know what it looks like, and what it will look\nlike. It’ll be business as usual.\n\nOne key word in there is “business.” If we’re not fully attentive to the\nnonmonetary externalities of infrastructure, the default basis for decisions\nabout what can and does get built will be economic. Especially if those\ndecisions are based on financial return, it builds in a bias toward waiting\nfor things to finally get so bad that remediation—no matter the cost—is\ncheaper than inaction. Rich communities will invest in renewable energy and\nclimate mitigation strategies. Poorer communities will see more and more of\ntheir days go into just trying to survive, on a seasonal and then a monthly\nand then a weekly basis, and finally they’ll just give up on the options. Life\nexpectancies will fall. The U.S. will become a land of climate refugees, of\ninternally displaced people moving from coastal communities that are drowned\nor southwestern communities that have run out of water to cities that still\nhave infrastructural provision, however minimal. Away from the cities, the\ncountry will be a patchwork of armed fiefdoms. More and more lives will be\nlost on the southern border, California will close its border to Americans\nfrom other states as it did briefly during the Great Depression, and the\nnorthern border will become militarized for the first time since the War of\n1812. Octavia Butler wrote about this future and if there are few positive\nscenarios in science fiction, there is no shortage of these dystopian\nbackdrops. What’s worse, though, is that the U.S. would be a smaller-scale\nversion of the planet as a whole, because if communities that are rich in\nresources continue to follow this path, they make it that much harder for\nothers to do anything different.\n\nAll of these possibilities are manifestations of a bunker mindset, a denial of\nthe web of mutuality that we’re all embedded in, at all scales. It’s a failure\nof social imagination, and it scares me. Because however they’re realized,\nwhether literally or metaphorically, the size of a room or the size of a\ncountry, if atomized bunkers become the norm, it will become much harder to\nthink and act collectively at all. Universal provision via collective systems\nis how we provide agency and autonomy to everyone, and limiting the freedoms\nof those around you is unethical and unsustainable, not least because it’s\nalmost always enforced through violence.\n\nI don’t want to live in that future. You don’t want to live there. We don’t\nwant this world for anyone. We want to live in that _other_ world, the one\nwhere we take everything we’ve learned about energy, networks, and matter,\nabout technology, standards, and collective systems, and we use it all to make\na world where everyone’s needs are met. Rather than an urban-rural divide, it\nmeans building telecommunications and transportation networks that connect\neveryone. Rather than letting aging infrastructure continue to decline, we can\nchoose to invest in it now and build it to be resilient in the face of climate\nchange. Rather than weaponizing national borders to keep out those who just\nwant the same infrastructurally supported standard of living, we can learn to\nact collectively, creating these systems everywhere. The future is not being\nimposed on us. We can decide what future we want to build. None of us want to\nabandon our neighbors, to bequeath a decaying country to our children, or to\nsee people imprisoned or killed at our borders. Rather than refusing to face\nthe reality of our resource usage and of climate change, or working to\nmitigate it just for ourselves and our immediate kin or neighbors, we can\nembrace the economic and social possibility of a just transition to\nsustainable and equitable systems, a possibility that’s based on the\nrecognition that infrastructure is a public and social good, not a money-\nmaking opportunity.\n\nWe have to imagine, individually and collectively, the kind of world we want\nto live in. For this, we can learn lessons from people who’ve fought for\nchange, everywhere, around the world. Infrastructural systems underpin our way\nof life, and understanding and engaging with them gives us a powerful lever to\nshift our future. We already know what we need to do to have reliable,\nresilient, and adaptable systems for energy and resources, and we’ll only\nlearn more as we progress. I know that this better world is—that better\nworlds, plural, are—possible. We need to choose to build them.\n\n## Becoming More Human\n\nIf my great-great-grandmother were to see me on an evening, puttering around\nmy apartment, making dinner for myself, doing small household chores or just\nsitting on the couch reading, she could easily conclude that I was an entirely\nself-sufficient loner because my daily life looks so different from hers. What\nwouldn’t be immediately visible to her is the way that I’m embedded in\nnetworks of mutual care. They are social, with my friends and family;\nprofessional, with my students and my colleagues; and civic, political, and\neconomic. Each network includes people right next to me and people on the\nother side of the world. Even though the source of my water or the energy that\npowers my lights is invisible from inside my home, these infrastructural\nsystems, with the technologies, organization, and enormous amount of human\nlabor needed to keep them functioning, are also networks of mutual care in\nwhich I am inextricably bound.\n\nJust like infrastructure, the human work of caring for other humans is also\ngenerally taken for granted, underappreciated, and undervalued. It doesn’t\nscale, it doesn’t produce a direct return on investment, and it can’t be put\noff or ignored. Nor can it be easily replaced. Futures researcher Jamais\nCascio has described a “pink collar future”—while other forms of human work\nand labor might be replaced by computers or technology, caregiving, which has\nhistorically been gendered, won’t be. Care is so dependent on context and on\nembodied, human interaction that it can’t easily be automated, made efficient,\nor optimized. People are intrinsically adaptive, resilient, responsive,\nlocally situated, and appropriate—exactly what we need from our\ninfrastructural systems in an era of climate instability. We need this\ncommunity-, society-, and civilization-wide commitment to collective systems\nof care, a pink-collar future for infrastructure. We especially need these\ncommitments as we navigate the transition that is anthropogenic climate\nchange.\n\nSociality—to care for, learn from, create alongside, and share our days with\neach other—is just as much a human need as food and water. We consider\nmobility to be a human right because it’s what enables us to be together, and\nthe explosive rise of telecommunications and the Internet over the past\ndecades is in large part because they facilitate social relationships. Not for\nnothing did humans start creating new ways to interact once our basic needs\nwere reliably met. Culture, learning, shared jokes and shared sorrow, raising\nour children, caring for our elderly, and together dreaming of and planning\nfor our futures—these activities are the essence of what it means to be human,\nboth individually and collectively. No matter who you are, no matter where you\nare, no matter _when_ you are—a hundred or a thousand years ago or as many\nyears from now—our relationships with each other, and what we create together,\nwon’t ever be replaced, mechanized, or automated away. Collective\ninfrastructural systems make it possible to take care of each other’s needs at\nscale, so we can take care of each other (and be taken care of in turn) as\nindividuals. It’s what they’re for. It’s why we need resilient, sustainable,\nand globally equitable infrastructural systems, ones that reliably meet our\nbasic biological needs, that increase our abilities and agency through access\nto energy, and that allow us to develop and foster our social relationships\nwith each other through communications and mobility. Our shared\ninfrastructural future is a commitment to our shared humanity.\n\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nIt seems appropriate that, while writing about the global, networked systems\nthat sustain us, I was myself so deeply sustained by my own global network of\npeople.\n\nThanks to Wayne Chambliss, Charlie Loyd, Robinson Meyer, Matthew Sniatynski,\nBradley Garrett, Justin Pickard, Adam Rothstein, Georgina Voss, Sherri\nWasserman, Paul Mison, and Paul Graham Raven for being partners in\ninfrastructural explorations, and for all the discussions that took place as\nwe biked on an aqueduct or followed a channelized river or climbed up a\nmountain or waited in the dark for a container ship to dock.\n\nI’m fortunate to have friends who are writers and so understood, much better\nthan I did, what it would take to turn ideas from a tangled web of synaptic\nconnections in my brain into a continuous line of words on a page. Tim\nCarmody, Rahawa Haile, Helen Macdonald, Kio Stark, and Clive Thompson all\nprovided practical advice and moral support, for which I’m grateful.\n\nAn entire team of “friendly experts” generously shared their time and\nexpertise. A number of them are my colleagues at Olin College of Engineering,\nincluding Sara Hendren, Ben Linder, Caitrin Lynch, Rob Martello, Jessica\nTownsend, Alison Wood, Callan Bignoli and Maggie Anderson. Alison, Charlie,\nTim, and Clive, as well as Stephanie Burt, Hillary Predko, and Matthew Weaver,\nbrought their varied perspectives and backgrounds to bear on manuscript\ndrafts. James Abraham, of SolarArise, shared his time and expertise and\narranged for me to visit their Telangana facility. All errors and infelicities\nare, of course, entirely my own.\n\nCourtney Young, my editor, saw the potential in me and these ideas long before\nI did, and it’s been a pleasure working with her, my agent Lydia Wills, and\nthe team at Riverhead Books to bring them out into the world. A grant from the\nAlfred P. Sloan Foundation supported the writing of this book, and the Boston\nAthenæum has been the best of all “third places” to work.\n\nMy deepest gratitude to my parents, Saroj and Fakir Chachra, for the\nupbringing that made this book possible, and to my siblings, Kitty, Vinny, and\nAneet, for their support. I’m particularly grateful to Aneet and my sister-in-\nlaw Ritu, for the many times they opened their home to me to serve as my Los\nAngeles writing refuge and base camp for West Coast explorations.\n\nIn her essay “Holy Water,” Joan Didion remarked that not many people she knew\ncarried their end of the conversation when she wanted to talk about California\nwater infrastructure, but my dear friends listened to me talk endlessly about\nthese systems and met it with their own enthusiasm. With love and thanks to\nEthan Marcotte and Liz Galle, Sidney Omelon, Scott Purdy, John Pittman, Andrew\nand Anindita Sempere, John Tinmouth and Tom Chang, and the International Cat\nClub (including Natalie Kane, Alex Leitch, Lauren O’Hara, and Mols Sauter),\nand most especially to Rob Ray for all of our adventures, collaborations, and\ncountless conversations.\n\nFinally, my undergraduate engineering students are a source of unfailing\nenthusiasm and curiosity, and because of them, I never lose sight of the\nfuture. To you, and to my niece and nephews Anya, Rayaan, Nikesh, and Aakash,\nmy thanks for the continuing inspiration to think about how we can together\nbuild a better world, for everyone.\n\nJune 2023\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\n\n# Further Exploration\n\nWait, what is that?” Once you begin to see the infrastructural systems in the\nworld around you, there is no going back. Fortunately, there are a number of\nwonderful visual guides, loaded with photographs, diagrams, and explanations,\nto help make sense of what’s around us. Brian Hayes’s _Infrastructure: A Guide\nto the Industrial Landscape_ (W. W. Norton, 2014) is a visual atlas and\nexplainer, with photographs of many of the physical systems in our\nenvironment, together with explanatory text. Kate Ascher’s books _The Works:\nAnatomy of a City_ (2005), _The Heights: Anatomy of a Skyscraper_ (2011), and\n_The Way to Go: Moving by Sea, Land, and Air_ (2014, all from Penguin) have\nwonderfully informative diagrams. Artist and researcher Ingrid Burrington’s\n_Networks of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide to Urban Internet\nInfrastructure_ (Melville House, 2016) is a hand-illustrated explainer of\nthese newest telecommunications systems.\n\nFor more of the stories behind infrastructural systems, I suggest Roman Mars\nand Kurt Kohlstedt’s _The 99% Invisible City: A Field Guide to the Hidden\nWorld of Everyday Design_ (Dey Street Books, 2020), a companion to their _99%\nInvisible_ podcast. _Places Journal_ (placesjournal.org) describes itself as\n“public scholarship on architecture, landscape, and urbanism,” and\ninfrastructure often sits at the intersection of all three. The work there is\nboth accessible and deeply researched, covering the full range of the\ntechnology systems in our lives. I’d recommend any of Shannon Mattern’s pieces\nto serve as a starting point. The Center for Land Use Interpretation\n(clui.org) carries out multidisciplinary research and education projects\ninvestigating the human uses of landscape in the U.S., including\ninfrastructural systems, and maintains a deep archive of photographs and other\nwork.\n\nSaul Griffith’s _Electrify: An Optimist’s Playbook for Our Clean Energy\nFuture_ (MIT Press, 2021) is exactly what the title suggests, a detailed guide\nto the practical aspects of making the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nWhile not directly cited in the text, Vaclav Smil’s _Energy and Civilization:\nA History_ (MIT Press, 2017) and James C. Scott’s _Seeing Like a State: How\nCertain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed_ (Yale University\nPress, 1998) provide many of the conceptual underpinnings for how we think\nabout these systems. This book was largely written before Schafran, Smith and\nHall’s _The Spatial Contract_ (Manchester University Press, 2020) crossed my\ndesk, and it was heartening to see that we highlighted many of the same\nconcerns and arrived at many of the same conclusions despite our different\nstarting points and perspectives. Finally, the opening quotation for this book\ncomes from Ursula Franklin’s _The Real World of Technology_ , the 1989 CBC\nMassey Lectures, broadcast across Canada as a six-part radio series and then\npublished in book form (the current edition is available from House of Anansi\nPress). I came across them as an undergraduate student in the same engineering\nschool where Dr. Franklin was professor emerita. It wasn’t until I reread\nthem, decades later, that I realized how profoundly they influenced the ways\nin which I think about technology, education, and care. Although she passed\naway in 2016, just as I was beginning to conceive of writing this book, the\nimpact of her ideas and values are reflected in these pages.\n\n\n# Notes\n\nIn the course of researching this book, I learned what every historian knows:\nthat every event and system has a long, complex, and contingent story about\nhow it came to pass, and nothing that happens is inevitable. I was necessarily\nselective about what I included, which also meant simplifying and\nstreamlining. I hope that these notes serve as an invitation to learn more\nabout the research and ideas that I drew on to discuss these complex and\nfascinating systems.\n\nThroughout the book, I’ve drawn on a number of sources for data on energy\nusage and emissions, including:\n\nInternational Energy Agency, “Data and Statistics,” [iea.org/data-and-\nstatistics](http://iea.org/data-and-statistics)\n\nHannah Ritchie, Max Roser, and Pablo Rosado, “Energy,” Our World in Data,\n[ourworldindata.org/energy](http://ourworldindata.org/energy)\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, “Data: Energy,”\n[data.oecd.org/energy.htm](http://data.oecd.org/energy.htm)\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency, “Greenhouse Gas Emissions and\nRemovals,” [epa.gov/ghgemissions](http://epa.gov/ghgemissions)\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, eia.gov\n\n## 1\\.

I am indebted foremost to the people of Ávila. The\ntimes I spent in Ávila have been some of the happiest, most stimulating, and\nalso most tranquil I have known. I hope that the sylvan thinking I learned to\nrecognize there can continue to grow through this book. Pagarachu.\n\nBefore I even went to Ávila, my grandparents the late Alberto and Costanza Di\nCapua had already prepared the way. Italian Jewish refugees settled in Quito,\nthey brought their curiosity to everything around them. In the 1940s and 1950s\nmy grandfather, a pharmaceutical chemist, participated in several scientific\nexpeditions to the Amazon forests in search of plant remedies. My grandmother,\na student of art history and literature in Rome, the city of her birth, turned\nto archaeology and anthropology in Quito as a way of understanding better the\nworld into which she had been thrown and which she would eventually call home.\nNonetheless, when I returned from my trips to Ávila she would insist I read to\nher from Dante’s Divine Comedy while she finished her evening soup. Literature\nand anthropology were never far removed for her or for me.\n\nI was twelve years old when I met Frank Salomon in my grandmother’s study.\nSalomon, a scholar like no other, and the person who would eventually direct\nmy PhD research at Wisconsin, taught me to see poetry as ethnography by other\nmeans and so opened the space for writing about things as strange and real as\nthinking forests and dreaming dogs. The University of Wisconsin–Madison was a\nwonderful environment for thinking about the Upper Amazon in its cultural,\nhistorical, and ecological contexts. I owe a great debt also to Carmen\nChuquín, Bill Denevan, Hugh Iltis, Joe McCann, Steve Stern, and Karl Zimmerer.\n\nI had the good fortune to write my dissertation—the first stab at what I’m\ntrying to do in this book—at the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe,\nthanks to a Weatherhead Resident Scholar Fellowship. There I am indebted to\nJames Brooks, Nancy Owen Lewis, and Doug Schwartz. I am also grateful to the\nother resident scholars in my cohort: Brian Klopotek, David Nugent, Steve\nPlog, Barbara Tedlock and Dennis Tedlock, and especially Katie Stewart, who\nwas always ready to talk about ideas as we hiked through the Santa Fe hills.\n\nIt was as a Woodrow Wilson Postdoctoral Fellow at the Townsend Center for the\nHumanities, Berkeley, that I began to develop the conceptual framework for\nthinking anthropologically beyond the human. I wish especially to acknowledge\nCandace Slater, as well as Tom Laqueur and Louise Fortmann, for this\nopportunity. I am also most grateful to my anthropology mentors at Berkeley.\nBill Hanks made me part of the anthropological community and sagely guided me,\nLawrence Cohen believed in me even when I didn’t, and Terry Deacon, in large\npart through his “pirates” seminar (with participants Ty Cashman, James Haag,\nJulie Hui, Jay Ogilvy, and Jeremy Sherman), created the most intellectually\nstimulating environment I have ever been in and forever changed the way I\nthink. Four friends and colleagues from those Berkeley days deserve a special\nmention: Liz Roberts, who taught me so much about anthropology (and who also\nintroduced me to all the right people), Cristiana Giordano, Pete Skafish, and\nAlexei Yurchak. The members of the anthropology department were extremely kind\nand supportive. Thanks especially to Stanley Brandes, Meg Conkey, Mariane\nFerme, Rosemary Joyce, Nelson Graburn, Christine Hastorf, Cori Hayden, Charles\nHirschkind, Don Moore, Stefania Pandolfo, Paul Rabinow, and Nancy Scheper-\nHughes.\n\nAt the Michigan Society of Fellows, I wish to thank the former director Jim\nWhite and the fellows, especially Paul Fine, Stella Nair, Neil Safier, and\nDaniel Stolzenberg, with whom I spent two wonderful years. At the University\nof Michigan’s Department of Anthropology, I am indebted to Ruth Behar, the\nlate Fernando Coronil, Webb Keane, Stuart Kirsch, Conrad Kottak, Alaina Lemon,\nBruce Mannheim, Jennifer Robertson, Gayle Rubin, Julie Skurski, and Katherine\nVerdery, as well as the members of my writing group, Rebecca Hardin, Nadine\nNaber, Julia Paley, Damani Partridge, and Miriam Ticktin.\n\nI also wish to express gratitude to my former Cornell colleagues, especially\nto Stacey Langwick, Michael Ralph, Nerissa Russell, Terry Turner, Marina\nWelker, Andrew Wilford, and, above all, Hiro Miyazaki and Annelise Riles, who\ngenerously organized (with the participation of Tim Choy, Tony Crook, Adam\nReed, and Audra Simpson) a workshop on my book manuscript.\n\nIn Montreal I have found a stimulating place to think, teach, and live. My\ncolleagues at McGill have supported me in countless ways. I especially wish to\nthank the following people for reading portions of the manuscript and/or\ndiscussing parts of the project: Colin Chapman, Oliver Coomes, Nicole Couture,\nJohn Galaty, Nick King, Katherine Lemons, Margaret Lock, Ron Niezen, Eugene\nRaikhel, Tobias Rees, Alberto Sánchez, Colin Scott, George Wenzel, and Allan\nYoung. Thank you also to my wonderful undergraduates, especially those who\ntook the courses “Anthropology and the Animal” and “Anthropology beyond the\nHuman.” I am also grateful to the graduate students who read and critically\nengaged parts of my book manuscript: Amy Barnes, Mónica Cuéllar, Darcie De\nAngelo, Arwen Fleming, Margaux Kristjansson, Sophie Llewelyn, Brodie Noga,\nShirin Radjavi, and Daniel Ruiz Serna. Finally, I am indebted to Sheehan Moore\nfor the help he provided as my able research assistant.\n\nMany people in Montreal and elsewhere have, over the years, supported and\ninspired my work. First and foremost I wish to thank Donna Haraway. Her\nrefusal to allow me to grow complacent in my thinking is for me the mark of a\ntrue friend. I also wish to thank Pepe Almeida, Angel Alvarado, Felicity\nAulino, Gretchen Bakke, Vanessa Barreiro, João Biehl, Michael Brown, Karen\nBruhns, Matei Candea, Manuela Carneiro da Cunha, Michael Cepek, Chris Chen,\nJohn Clark, Biella Coleman, André Costopoulos, Mike Cowan, Veena Das, Nais\nDave, Marisol de la Cadena, MaryJo DelVecchio Good, Bob Desjarlais, Nick Dew,\nAlicia Díaz, Arcadio Díaz Quiñones, Didier Fassin, Carlos Fausto, Steve Feld,\nAllen Feldman, Blenda Femenias, Enrique Fernández, Jennifer Fishman, Agustín\nFuentes, Duana Fullwiley, Chris Garces, Fernando García, the late Clifford\nGeertz, Ilana Gershon, Eric Glassgold, Maurizio Gnerre, Ian Gold, Byron Good,\nMark Goodale, Peter Gose, Michel Grignon, Geoconda Guerra, Rob Hamrick, Clara\nHan, Susan Harding, Stefan Helmreich, Michael Herzfeld, Kregg Hetherington,\nFrank Hutchins, Sandra Hyde, Tim Ingold, Frédéric Keck, Chris Kelty, Eben\nKirksey, Tom Lamarre, Hannah Landecker, Bruno Latour, Jean Lave, Ted\nMacdonald, Setrag Manoukian, Carmen Martínez, Ken Mills, Josh Moses, Blanca\nMuratorio, Paul Nadasdy, Kristin Norget, Janis Nuckolls, Mike Oldani, Ben\nOrlove, Anand Pandian, Héctor Parión, Morten Pederson, Mario Perín, Michael\nPuett, Diego Quiroga, Hugh Raffles, Lucinda Ramberg, Charlie Reeves, Lisa\nRofel, Mark Rogers, Marshall Sahlins, Fernando Santos-Granero, Patrice Schuch,\nNatasha Schull, Jim Scott, Glenn Shepard, Kimbra Smith, Barb Smuts, Marilyn\nStrathern, Tod Swanson, Anne-Christine Taylor, Lucien Taylor, Mike Uzendoski,\nIsmael Vaccaro, Yomar Verdezoto, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Norm Whitten,\nEileen Willingham, Yves Winter, and Gladys Yamberla.\n\nMany tropical biologists taught me over the years about their field and\nallowed me to bounce ideas off of them. David Benzing and Steve Hubbell were\nearly mentors. Thanks also to Selene Baez, Robyn Burnham, Paul Fine, and Nigel\nPitman. I am grateful for having had the opportunity to immerse myself in this\narea of study through the tropical ecology field course run by the\nOrganization for Tropical Studies (OTS) in Costa Rica. Quito has a vibrant and\nwarm community of biologists, and I thank the late Fernando Ortíz Crespo,\nGiovanni Onore and Lucho Coloma at the Universidad Católica, as well as Walter\nPalacios, Homero Vargas, and especially David Neill at the Herbario Nacional\ndel Ecuador for so generously taking me in. This project involves a sizable\nethnobiological component, and I am grateful to all the specialists who helped\nme identify my specimens. I would especially like to thank David Neill once\nagain for his careful revision of my botanical collections. I am also indebted\nto Efraín Freire for his work with these collections. For their botanical\ndeterminations, I wish to acknowledge the following individuals (followed by\nthe herbaria they were affiliated with when they made the identifications): M.\nAsanza (QCNE), S. Baez (QCA), J. Clark (US), C. Dodson (MO), E. Freire (QCNE),\nJ.P. Hedin (MO), W. Nee (NY), D. Neill (MO), W. Palacios (QCNE), and T.D.\nPennington (K). I wish to thank G. Onore, as well as M. Ayala, E. Baus, C.\nCarpio, all at the time at QCAZ; and D. Roubick (STRI) for determining my\ninvertebrate collections. I wish to thank L. Coloma as well as J. Guayasamín\nand S. Ron, at the time at QCAZ, for determining my herpetofauna collections.\nI am grateful to P. Jarrín (QCAZ) for determining my mammal collections.\nFinally, I wish to thank Ramiro Barriga of the Escuela Politécnica Nacional\nfor determining my fish collections.\n\nThis project would not have been possible without the generous support of many\ninstitutions. I am grateful for a Fulbright Grant for Graduate Study and\nResearch Abroad, a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, a\nFulbright-Hays Doctoral Research Abroad Grant, a University of\nWisconsin–Madison Latin American and Iberian Studies Field Research Grant, a\nWenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research Pre-Doctoral Grant, and a\ngrant from the Fonds québécois de la recherche sur la société et la culture\n(FQRSC).\n\nI was lucky enough to have had the opportunity to present the book’s entire\nargument through visiting professorships at Oberlin College (for which I thank\nJack Glazier) and at L’École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS) by\nthe generous invitation of Philippe Descola. I have also presented portions of\nthe argument at Carleton University, the University of Chicago, the Facultad\nLatinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales sede Ecuador (FLACSO), Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of\nCalifornia, Santa Cruz, the University of Toronto, and Yale University. An\nearlier version of chapter 4 appeared in American Ethnologist.\n\nNumerous people have engaged with the book as a whole. I cannot thank Olga\nGonzález, Josh Reno, Candace Slater, Anna Tsing, and Mary Weismantel enough\nfor their stimulating, thoughtful, and constructive reviews. I am grateful to\nDavid Brent, Priya Nelson, and Jason Weidemann for their sustained interest in\nthis project. I wish to give special thanks to Pete Skafish and Alexei\nYurchak, who took time from their busy lives to carefully read large portions\nof the book (and to discuss them with me at length via Skype), and I am\nespecially indebted to Lisa Stevenson for critically reading and meticulously\nediting the entire manuscript. Finally, I wish to thank Reed Malcolm, my\neditor at the University of California Press, for being jazzed by what must\nsurely have seemed like a risky project. I also wish to thank Stacy\nEisenstark; my patient copy editor, Sheila Berg; and my project manager, Kate\nHoffman.\n\nI owe so much to my family members for all they have given me. I could not\nhave had a more generous uncle than Alejandro Di Capua. I wish to thank him\nand his family for always welcoming me into their Quito home. My uncle Marco\nDi Capua, who shares my love for Latin American history and science, was,\nalong with his family, always interested in hearing about my work, and for\nthis I am most grateful. I also wish to express my gratitude to Riccardo Di\nCapua and all my Ecuadorian Kohn cousins. I especially wish to thank the late\nVera Kohn for reminding me how to think in wholes.\n\nI am fortunate to have had the unfailing love and support of my parents, Anna\nRosa and Joe, and my sisters, Emma and Alicia. My mother was the first to\nteach me to notice things in the woods; my father, how to think for myself;\nand my sisters, how to think about others.\n\nI am indebted to my mother-in-law, Frances Stevenson, who spent several of her\nsummer vacations on lakes in Quebec, Ontario, and the Adirondacks watching the\nkids while I wrote. I am also grateful to my father-in-law, Romeyn Stevenson,\nand his wife, Christine, for understanding that this other kind of “work” I\nalways seemed to bring to the farm would keep me away from many more pressing\nchores.\n\nFinally, thank you, Benjamin and Milo, for putting up with all this “’versity”\nstuff, as you put it. You teach me every day how to see my university work as\nyour kind of play. Gracias. And thank you, Lisa, for everything; for inspiring\nme, for helping me both to grow and to recognize my limits, and for being such\na wonderful companion in this life of ours.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n![](images/img_0002.jpg)\n\nIntroduction: Runa Puma\n\nAhi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura\n\nesta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte . . .\n\n[Ah, it is hard to speak of what it was\n\nthat savage forest, dense and difficult . . .]\n\n—Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy, Inferno, Canto I [trans. Mandelbaum]\n\nSettling down to sleep under our hunting camp’s thatch lean-to in the\nfoothills of Sumaco Volcano, Juanicu warned me, “Sleep faceup! If a jaguar\ncomes he’ll see you can look back at him and he won’t bother you. If you sleep\nfacedown he’ll think you’re aicha [prey; lit., “meat” in Quichua] and he’ll\nattack.” If, Juanicu was saying, a jaguar sees you as a being capable of\nlooking back—a self like himself, a you—he’ll leave you alone. But if he\nshould come to see you as prey—an it—you may well become dead\nmeat.[1](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn1)\n\nHow other kinds of beings see us matters. That other kinds of beings see us\nchanges things. If jaguars also represent us—in ways that can matter vitally\nto us—then anthropology cannot limit itself just to exploring how people from\ndifferent societies might happen to represent them as doing so. Such\nencounters with other kinds of beings force us to recognize the fact that\nseeing, representing, and perhaps knowing, even thinking, are not exclusively\nhuman affairs.\n\nHow would coming to terms with this realization change our understandings of\nsociety, culture, and indeed the sort of world that we inhabit? How does it\nchange the methods, scope, practice, and stakes of anthropology? And, more\nimportant, how does it change our understanding of anthropology’s object—the\n“human”—given that in that world beyond the human we sometimes find things we\nfeel more comfortable attributing only to ourselves?\n\nThat jaguars represent the world does not mean that they necessarily do so as\nwe do. And this too changes our understanding of the human. In that realm\nbeyond the human, processes, such as representation, that we once thought we\nunderstood so well, that once seemed so familiar, suddenly begin to appear\nstrange.\n\nSo as not to become meat we must return the jaguar’s gaze. But in this\nencounter we do not remain unchanged. We become something new, a new kind of\n“we” perhaps, aligned somehow with that predator who regards us as a predator\nand not, fortunately, as dead meat. The forests around Juanicu’s Quichua-\nspeaking Runa village, Ávila, in Ecuador’s Upper Amazon (a village that is a\nlong day’s hike from that makeshift shelter under which we, that night, were\ndiligently sleeping faceup) are haunted by such\nencounters.[2](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn2) They are full of runa puma, shape-\nshifting human-jaguars, or were-jaguars as I will call them.\n\nRuna in Quichua means “person”; puma means “predator” or “jaguar.” These runa\npuma—beings who can see themselves being seen by jaguars as fellow predators,\nand who also sometimes see other humans the way jaguars do, namely, as\nprey—have been known to wander all the way down to the distant Napo River. The\nshamans in Río Blanco, a Runa settlement on the banks of the Upper Napo where\nI worked in the late 1980s, would see these were-jaguars in their aya huasca-\ninduced visions.[3](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn3) “The runa puma that walk the\nforests around here,” one shaman told me, “they’re from Ávila.” They described\nthese massive runa puma as having white hides. The Ávila Runa, they insisted,\nbecome jaguars, white were-jaguars, yura runa puma.\n\nÁvila enjoys a certain reputation in the Runa communities of the Upper Napo.\n“Be careful going up to Ávila,” I was cautioned. “Be especially wary of their\ndrinking parties. When you go out to pee you might come back to find that your\nhosts have become jaguars.” In the early 1990s, in Tena, the capital of Napo\nProvince, a friend and I went out drinking one night at a cantina, a makeshift\ntavern, with some of the leaders of FOIN, the provincial indigenous\nfederation. Amid boasts of their own prowess—Who could command the most\nsupport from the base communities? Who could best bring in the big NGO\nchecks?—talk turned more specifically to shamanic power and where the seat of\nsuch power, the font of FOIN’s strength, really lay. Was it, as some that\nnight held, Arajuno, south of the Napo? This is an area of Runa settlement\nthat borders on the east and south with the Huaorani, a group that many Runa\nview with a mixture of fear, awe, and disdain as “savage” (auca in Quichua,\nhence their pejorative ethnonym Auca). Or was it Ávila, home to so many runa\npuma?\n\nThat night around the cantina table Ávila edged out Arajuno as a center of\npower. This village at first might seem an unlikely choice to signify shamanic\npower in the figure of a jaguar. Its inhabitants, as they would be the first\nto insist, are anything but “wild.” They are, and, as they invariably make\nclear, have always been Runa—literally, “human persons”—which for them means\nthat they have always been Christian and “civilized.” One might even say that\nthey are, in important but complicated ways (ways explored in the final\nchapter), “white.” But they are, some of them, also equally—and\nreally—puma.[4](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn4)\n\nÁvila’s position as a seat of shamanic power derives not just from its\nrelation to some sort of sylvan savagery but also from its particular position\nin a long colonial history (see figure 1). Ávila was one of the earliest sites\nof Catholic indoctrination and Spanish colonization in the Upper Amazon. It\nwas also the epicenter of a late-sixteenth-century regionally coordinated\nuprising against the Spaniards.\n\nThat rebellion against the Spaniards, a response in part to the increasingly\nonerous burden of tribute payment, was, according to colonial sources, sparked\nby the visions of two shamans. Beto, from the Archidona region, saw a cow who\n“spoke with him . . . and told him that the God of the Christians was very\nangry with the Spaniards who were in that land.” Guami, from the Ávila region,\nwas “transported out of this life for five days during which he saw\nmagnificent things, and the God of the Christians sent him to kill everyone\nand burn their houses and crops” (de Ortiguera 1989 [1581–85]:\n361).[5](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn5) In the uprising that ensued the Indians around\nÁvila did, according to these sources, kill all the Spaniards (save one, about\nwhom more in chapter 3), destroy their houses, and eradicate the orange and\nfig trees and all the other foreign crops from the land.\n\nThese contradictions—that Runa shamans receive messages from Christian gods\nand that the were-jaguars that wander the forests around Ávila are white—are\npart of what drew me to Ávila. The Ávila Runa are far removed from any image\nof a pristine or wild Amazon. Their world—their very being—is thoroughly\ninformed by a long and layered colonial history. And today their village is\njust a few kilometers from the growing, bustling colonist town of Loreto and\nthe expanding network of roads that connects this town with increasing\nefficiency to the rest of Ecuador. And yet they also live intimately with all\nkinds of real jaguars that walk the forests around Ávila; these include those\nthat are white, those that are Runa, and those that are decidedly spotted.\n\nThis intimacy in large part involves eating and also the real risk of being\neaten. A jaguar killed a child when I was in Ávila. (He was the son of the\nwoman posing with her daughter in the photograph that serves as the\nfrontispiece for this chapter, a photograph the mother asked me to take so\nthat she might have some memory of her daughter if she too were taken away.)\nAnd jaguars, as I discuss later in this book, also killed several dogs during\nmy time in Ávila. They also shared their food with us. On several occasions we\nfound half-eaten carcasses of agoutis and pacas that were-jaguars had left for\nus in the forest as gifts and that subsequently became our meals. Felines of\nall kinds, including these generous meat-bearing runa puma, are sometimes\nhunted.\n\n![](images/img_0003.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 1. As visible from the detail of the eighteenth-century map reproduced\nhere (which corresponds very roughly to modern Ecuador’s Andean and Amazonian\nregions), Ávila (upper center) was considered a missionary center (represented\nby a cross). It was connected by foot trails (dotted line) to other such\ncenters, such as Archidona, as well as to the navigable Napo River (a\ntributary of the Amazon), and to Quito (upper left). The linear distance\nbetween Quito and Ávila is approximately 130 kilometers. The map indicates\nsome of the historical legacies of colonial networks in which Ávila is\nimmersed; the landscape of course has not remained unchanged. Loreto, the\nmajor colonist town, approximately 25 kilometers east of Ávila, is wholly\nabsent from the map, though it figures prominently in the lives of the Ávila\nRuna and in this book. From Requena 1779 [1903]. Collection of the author.\n\nEating also brings people in intimate relation to the many other kinds of\nnonhuman beings that make the forest their home. During the four years that I\nworked in Ávila villagers bought many things in Loreto. They bought things\nsuch as shotguns, ammunition, clothing, salt, many of the household items that\nwould have been made by hand a couple of generations ago, and lots of the\ncontraband cane liquor that they call cachihua. What they didn’t buy was food.\nAlmost all the food they shared with each other and with me came from their\ngardens, the nearby rivers and streams, and the forest. Getting food through\nhunting, fishing, gathering, gardening, and the management of a variety of\necological assemblages involves people intimately with one of the most complex\necosystems in the world—one that is chock-full of an astounding array of\ndifferent kinds of interacting and mutually constituting beings. And it brings\nthem into very close contact with the myriad creatures—and not just\njaguars—that make their lives there. This involvement draws people into the\nlives of the forest. It also entangles the lives of that forest with worlds we\nmight otherwise consider “all too human,” by which I mean the moral worlds we\nhumans create, which permeate our lives and so deeply affect those of others.\n\nGods talking through the bodies of cows, Indians in the bodies of jaguars,\njaguars in the clothing of whites, the runa puma enfolds these. What are we\nanthropologists—versed as we are in the ethnographic charting of the\ndistinctive meaning-filled morally loaded worlds we humans create (distinctive\nworlds that make us feel that we are exceptions in this universe)—to make of\nthis strange other-than-human and yet all-too-human creature? How should we\napproach this Amazonian Sphinx?\n\nMaking sense of this creature poses a challenge not unlike the one posed by\nthat other Sphinx, the one Oedipus encountered on his way to Thebes. That\nSphinx asked Oedipus, “What goes on four legs in the morning, on two legs at\nnoon, and on three legs in the evening?” To survive this encounter Oedipus,\nlike the members of our hunting party, had to figure out how to correctly\nrespond. His answer to the riddle the Sphinx posed from her position somewhere\n(slightly) beyond the human was, “Man.” It is a response that, in light of the\nSphinx’s question, begs us to ask, What are we?\n\nThat other-than-human Sphinx whom, despite her inhumanity, we nevertheless\nregard and to whom we must respond, asks us to question what we think we know\nabout the human. And her question reveals something about our answer. Asking\nwhat first goes on four, then on two, then on three legs simultaneously\ninvokes the shared legacies of our four-pawed animality and our distinctively\nbipedal peripatetic humanity, as well the various kinds of canes we fashion\nand incorporate to feel our ways through our finite lives—lives whose ends, as\nKaja Silverman (2009) observes, ultimately connect us to all the other beings\nwith whom we share the fact of finitude.\n\nFooting for the unsteady, a guide for the blind, a cane mediates between a\nfragile mortal self and the world that spans beyond. In doing so it represents\nsomething of that world, in some way or another, to that self. Insofar as they\nserve to represent something of the world to someone, many entities exist that\ncan function as canes for many kinds of selves. Not all these entities are\nartifacts. Nor are all these kinds of selves human. In fact, along with\nfinitude, what we share with jaguars and other living selves—whether\nbacterial, floral, fungal, or animal—is the fact that how we represent the\nworld around us is in some way or another constitutive of our being.\n\nA cane also prompts us to ask with Gregory Bateson, “where” exactly, along its\nsturdy length, “do I start?” (Bateson 2000a: 465). And in thus highlighting\nrepresentation’s contradictory nature—Self or world? Thing or thought? Human\nor not?—it indicates how pondering the Sphinx’s question might help us arrive\nat a more capacious understanding of Oedipus’s answer.\n\nThis book is an attempt to ponder the Sphinx’s riddle by attending\nethnographically to a series of Amazonian other-than-human encounters.\nAttending to our relations with those beings that exist in some way beyond the\nhuman forces us to question our tidy answers about the human. The goal here is\nneither to do away with the human nor to reinscribe it but to open it. In\nrethinking the human we must also rethink the kind of anthropology that would\nbe adequate to this task. Sociocultural anthropology in its various forms as\nit is practiced today takes those attributes that are distinctive to\nhumans—language, culture, society, and history—and uses them to fashion the\ntools to understand humans. In this process the analytical object becomes\nisomorphic with the analytics. As a result we are not able to see the myriad\nways in which people are connected to a broader world of life, or how this\nfundamental connection changes what it might mean to be human. And this is why\nexpanding ethnography to reach beyond the human is so important. An\nethnographic focus not just on humans or only on animals but also on how\nhumans and animals relate breaks open the circular closure that otherwise\nconfines us when we seek to understand the distinctively human by means of\nthat which is distinctive to humans.\n\nCreating an analytical framework that can include humans as well as nonhumans\nhas been a central concern of science and technology studies (see esp. Latour\n1993, 2005), the “multispecies” or animal turn (see esp. Haraway 2008; Mullin\nand Cassidy 2007; Choy et al. 2009; see also Kirksey and Helmreich 2010 for a\nreview), and Deleuze-influenced (Deleuze and Guattari 1987) scholarship (e.g.,\nBennett 2010). Along with these approaches I share the fundamental belief that\nsocial science’s greatest contribution—the recognition and delimitation of a\nseparate domain of socially constructed reality—is also its greatest curse.\nAlong with these I also feel that finding ways to move beyond this problem is\none of the most important challenges facing critical thought today. And I have\nespecially been swayed by Donna Haraway’s conviction that there is something\nabout our everyday engagements with other kinds of creatures that can open new\nkinds of possibilities for relating and understanding.\n\nThese “posthumanities” have been remarkably successful at focusing on the zone\nbeyond the human as a space for critique and possibility. However, their\nproductive conceptual engagement with this zone is hampered by certain\nassumptions, shared with anthropology and social theory more broadly,\nconcerning the nature of representation. Furthermore, in attempting to address\nsome of the difficulties these assumptions about representation create, they\ntend to arrive at reductionistic solutions that flatten important distinctions\nbetween humans and other kinds of beings, as well as those between selves and\nobjects.\n\nIn How Forests Think I seek to contribute to these posthuman critiques of the\nways in which we have treated humans as exceptional—and thus as fundamentally\nseparate from the rest of the world—by developing a more robust analytic for\nunderstanding human relations to nonhuman beings. I do so by reflecting on\nwhat it might mean to say that forests think. I do so, that is, by working out\nthe connection between representational processes (which form the basis for\nall thought) and living ones as this is revealed through ethnographic\nattention to that which lies beyond the human. I use the insights thus gained\nto rethink our assumptions about the nature of representation, and I then\nexplore how this rethinking changes our anthropological concepts. I call this\napproach an “anthropology beyond the human.”[6](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn6)\n\nIn this endeavor I draw on the work of the nineteenth-century philosopher\nCharles Peirce (1931, 1992a, 1998a), especially his work in semiotics (the\nstudy of how signs represent things in the world). In particular I invoke what\nthe Chicago-trained linguistic anthropologist Alejandro Paz calls the “weird”\nPeirce, by which he means those aspects of Peirce’s writing that we\nanthropologists find hard to digest—those parts that reach beyond the human to\nsituate representation in the workings and logics of a broader nonhuman\nuniverse out of which we humans come. I also draw greatly on Terrence Deacon’s\nremarkably creative application of Peircean semiotics to biology and to\nquestions of what he calls “emergence” (see Deacon 2006, 2012).\n\nThe first step toward understanding how forests think is to discard our\nreceived ideas about what it means to represent something. Contrary to our\nassumptions, representation is actually something more than conventional,\nlinguistic, and symbolic. Inspired and emboldened by Frank Salomon’s (2004)\npioneering work on the representational logics of Andean knotted cords and\nJanis Nuckolls’s (1996) work on Amazonian sound images, this is an ethnography\nthat explores representational forms that go beyond language. But it does so\nby going beyond the human. Nonhuman life-forms also represent the world. This\nmore expansive understanding of representation is hard to appreciate because\nour social theory—whether humanist or posthumanist, structuralist or\npoststructuralist—conflates representation with language.\n\nWe conflate representation with language in the sense that we tend to think of\nhow representation works in terms of our assumptions about how human language\nworks. Because linguistic representation is based on signs that are\nconventional, systemically related to one another, and “arbitrarily” related\nto their objects of reference, we tend to assume that all representational\nprocesses have these properties. But symbols, those kinds of signs that are\nbased on convention (like the English word dog), which are distinctively human\nrepresentational forms, and whose properties make human language possible,\nactually emerge from and relate to other modalities of representation. In\nPeirce’s terminology these other modalities (in broad terms) are either\n“iconic” (involving signs that share likenesses with the things they\nrepresent) or “indexical” (involving signs that are in some way affected by or\notherwise correlated with those things they represent). In addition to being\nsymbolic creatures we humans share these other semiotic modalities with the\nrest of nonhuman biological life (Deacon 1997). These nonsymbolic\nrepresentational modalities pervade the living world—human and nonhuman—and\nhave underexplored properties that are quite distinct from those that make\nhuman language special.\n\nAlthough there are anthropological approaches that do move beyond the symbolic\nto study the full range of Peircean signs, they locate such signs exclusively\ninside a human framework. Accordingly, those who use signs are understood to\nbe human, and though signs may be extralinguistic (with the consequence that\nlanguage can be treated as something more than symbolic) the contexts that\nmake them meaningful are human sociocultural ones (see esp. Silverstein 1995;\nMannheim 1991; Keane 2003; Parmentier 1994; Daniel 1996; on “context,” see\nDuranti and Goodwin 1992).\n\nThese approaches fail to recognize that signs also exist well beyond the human\n(a fact that changes how we should think about human semiosis as well). Life\nis constitutively semiotic. That is, life is, through and through, the product\nof sign processes (Bateson 2000c, 2002; Deacon 1997; Hoffmeyer 2008; Kull et\nal. 2009). What differentiates life from the inanimate physical world is that\nlife-forms represent the world in some way or another, and these\nrepresentations are intrinsic to their being. What we share with nonhuman\nliving creatures, then, is not our embodiment, as certain strains of\nphenomenological approaches would hold, but the fact that we all live with and\nthrough signs. We all use signs as “canes” that represent parts of the world\nto us in some way or another. In doing so, signs make us what we are.\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between distinctively human forms of\nrepresentation and these other forms is key to finding a way to practice an\nanthropology that does not radically separate humans from nonhumans. Semiosis\n(the creation and interpretation of signs) permeates and constitutes the\nliving world, and it is through our partially shared semiotic propensities\nthat multispecies relations are possible, and also analytically\ncomprehensible.\n\nThis way of understanding semiosis can help us move beyond a dualistic\napproach to anthropology, in which humans are portrayed as separate from the\nworlds they represent, toward a monistic one, in which how humans represent\njaguars and how jaguars represent humans can be understood as integral, though\nnot interchangeable, parts of a single, open-ended story. Given the challenges\nposed by learning to live with the proliferating array of other kinds of life-\nforms that increasingly surround us—be they pets, weeds, pests, commensals,\nnew pathogens, “wild” animals, or technoscientific “mutants”—developing a\nprecise way to analyze how the human is both distinct from and continuous with\nthat which lies beyond it is both crucial and timely.\n\nThis search for a better way to attend to our relations to that which lies\nbeyond the human, especially that part of the world beyond the human that is\nalive, forces us to make ontological claims—claims, that is, about the nature\nof reality. That, for example, jaguars in some way or other represent the\nworld demands a general explanation that takes into account certain insights\nabout the way the world is—insights that are garnered from attention to\nengagements with nonhumans and that are thus not fully circumscribed by any\nparticular human system of understanding them.\n\nAs a recent debate makes clear (Venkatesan et al. 2010), ontology, as it\ncirculates in our discipline, is a thorny term. On the one hand, it is often\nnegatively associated with a search for ultimate truths—the kinds that the\nethnographic documentation of so many different ways of doing and seeing is so\ngood at debunking (Carrithers 2010: 157). On the other hand, it sometimes\nseems to function as nothing more than a trendy word for culture, especially\nwhen a possessive pronoun precedes it: our ontology, say, versus theirs\n(Holbraad 2010: 180).\n\nIn mobilizing Amazonian ethnography to think ontologically, I place myself in\nthe company of two eminent anthropologists, Philippe Descola and Eduardo\nViveiros de Castro, who have had a great and lasting influence on my research.\nTheir work has gained traction in anthropology because of the ways it renders\nontology plural without turning it into culture: different worlds instead of\ndifferent worldviews (Candea 2010: 175). But the recognition of multiple\nrealities only side steps the question: Can anthropology make general claims\nabout the way the world is?[7](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn7) Despite the many\nproblems that making general claims raises—problems that our various forms of\nrelativism struggle to keep at bay—I think anthropology can. And I think\nanthropology, to be true to the world, must find ways of making such claims,\nin part because, as I will argue, generality itself is a property of the world\nand not just something we humans impose on it. And yet, given our assumptions\nabout representation, it seems difficult to make such claims. This book seeks\nto get beyond this impasse.\n\nI do not, then, wish to enter the ontological from the direction of the human.\nMy goal is not to isolate configurations of ontological propositions that crop\nup at a particular place or time (Descola 2005). I choose, rather, to enter at\na more basic level. And I try to see what we can learn by lingering at that\nlevel. I ask, What kinds of insights about the nature of the world become\napparent when we attend to certain engagements with parts of that world that\nreveal some of its different entities, dynamics, and properties?\n\nIn sum, an anthropology beyond the human is perforce an ontological one. That\nis, taking nonhumans seriously makes it impossible to confine our\nanthropological inquiries to an epistemological concern for how it is that\nhumans, at some particular time or in some particular place, go about making\nsense of them. As an ontological endeavor this kind of anthropology places us\nin a special position to rethink the sorts of concepts we use and to develop\nnew ones. In Marilyn Strathern’s words, it aims “to create the conditions for\nnew thoughts” (1988: 20).\n\n![](images/img_0004.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2. Ávila circa 1992. Photo by author.\n\nSuch an endeavor might seem detached from the more mundane worlds of\nethnographic experience that serve as the foundations for anthropological\nargumentation and insight. And yet this project, and the book that attempts to\ndo it justice, is rigorously empirical in the sense that the questions it\naddresses grow out of many different kinds of experiential encounters that\nemerged over the course of a long immersion in the field. As I’ve attempted to\ncultivate these questions I’ve come to see them as articulations of general\nproblems that become amplified, and thus made visible, through my struggles to\npay ethnographic attention to how people in Ávila relate to different kinds of\nbeings.\n\nThis anthropology beyond the human, then, grows out of an intense sustained\nengagement with a place and those who make their lives there. I have known\nÁvila, its environs, and the people who live there for a human generation; the\ninfants I was introduced to on my first visit in 1992 were when I last visited\nin 2010 young parents; their parents are now grandparents, and some of the\nparents of those new grandparents are now dead (see figure 2). I spent four\nyears (1996–2000) living in Ecuador and conducting fieldwork in Ávila and\ncontinue to visit regularly.\n\nThe experiential bases for this book are many. Some of the most important\nencounters with other kinds of beings came on my walks through the forest with\nRuna hunters, others when I was left alone in the forest, sometimes for hours,\nas these hunters ran off in pursuit of their quarry—quarry that sometimes\nended up circling back on me. Still others occurred during my slow strolls at\ndusk in the forest just beyond the manioc gardens that surround people’s\nhouses where I would be privy to the last burst of activity before so many of\nthe forest’s creatures settled down for the night.\n\n![](images/img_0005.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3. Drinking beer. Photo by author.\n\nI spent much of my time trying to listen, often with a tape recorder in hand,\nto how people in everyday contexts relate their experiences with different\nkinds of beings. These conversations often took place while drinking manioc\nbeer with relatives and neighbors or while sipping huayusa tea around the\nhearth in the middle of the night (figure 3).[8](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn8) The\ninterlocutors here were usually human and usually Runa. But “conversation”\nalso occasionally involved other kinds of beings: the squirrel cuckoo who flew\nover the house whose call so radically changed the course of discussion down\nbelow; the household dogs with whom people sometimes need to make themselves\nunderstood; the woolly monkeys and the powerful spirits that inhabit the\nforest; and even the politicians who trudge up to the village during election\nseason. With all of these, people in Ávila struggle to find channels of\ncommunication.\n\nIn my pursuit of certain tangibles of the ecological webs in which the Runa\nare immersed I also compiled many hundreds of ethnobiological specimens. These\nwere identified by specialists, and they are now housed in Ecuador’s main\nherbarium and museums of natural history.[9](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn9) Making\nthese collections very quickly gave me some sort of purchase on the forest and\nits many creatures. It also allowed an entry to people’s understandings of\necological relations and gave me a way to articulate this with other bodies of\nknowledge about the forest world not necessarily bounded by that particular\nhuman context. Collecting imposes its own structures on forest relationships,\nand I was not unaware of the limitations—and motivations—of this search for\nstable knowledge, as well as the fact that, in some important respects, my\nefforts as a collector were quite different from Runa ways of engaging with\nthe beings of the forest (see Kohn 2005).\n\nI also sought to pay attention to forest experiences as they resonate through\nother arenas that are less grounded. Everyday life in Ávila is entangled with\nthat second life of sleep and its dreams. Sleeping in Ávila is not the\nconsolidated, solitary, sensorially deprived endeavor it has so often become\nfor us. Sleep—surrounded by lots of people in open thatch houses with no\nelectricity and largely exposed to the outdoors—is continuously interspersed\nwith wakefulness. One awakens in the middle of the night to sit by the fire\nand ward off the chill, or to receive a gourd bowl full of steaming huayusa\ntea, or on hearing the common potoo call during a full moon, or sometimes even\nthe distant hum of a jaguar. And one awakens also to the extemporaneous\ncomments people make throughout the night about those voices they hear. Thanks\nto these continuous disruptions, dreams spill into wakefulness and wakefulness\ninto dreams in a way that entangles both. Dreams—my own, those of my\nhousemates, the strange ones we shared, and even those of their dogs—came to\noccupy a great deal of my ethnographic attention, especially because they so\noften involved the creatures and spirits that people the forest. Dreams too\nare part of the empirical, and they are a kind of real. They grow out of and\nwork on the world, and learning to be attuned to their special logics and\ntheir fragile forms of efficacy helps reveal something about the world beyond\nthe human.\n\nThe thinking in this book works itself through images. Some of these come in\nthe form of dreams, but they also appear as examples, anecdotes, riddles,\nquestions, conundrums, uncanny juxtapositions, and even photographs. Such\nimages can work on us if we would let them. My goal here is to create the\nconditions necessary to make this sort of thinking possible.\n\nThis book is an attempt to encounter an encounter, to look back at these\nlooking-backs, to face that which the runa puma asks of us, and to formulate a\nresponse. That response is—to adopt a title from one of the books that Peirce\nnever completed (Peirce 1992b)—my “guess at the riddle” that the Sphinx posed.\nIt is my sense of what we can learn when we attend ethnographically to how the\nSphinx’s question might reconfigure the human. Making claims about and beyond\nthe human in anthropology is dangerous business; we are experts at undermining\narguments through appeals to hidden contexts. This is the analytical trump\ncard that every well-trained anthropologist has up her sleeve. In this sense,\nthen, this is an unusual project, and it requires of you, the reader, a\nmodicum of goodwill, patience, and the willingness to struggle to allow the\nwork done here to work itself through you.\n\nThis book will not immediately plunge you into the messy entangled, “natural-\ncultural” worlds (Latour 1993) whose witnessing has come to be the hallmark of\nanthropological approaches to nonhumans. Rather, it seeks a gentler immersion\nin a kind of thinking that grows. It begins with very simple matters so that\ncomplexity, context, and entanglement can themselves become the objects of\nethnographic analysis rather than the unquestioned conditions for it.\n\nAs such, the first chapters may seem far removed from an exposition of the\ncomplicated, historically situated, power-laden contexts that so deeply inform\nRuna ways of being—an exposition we justifiably expect from ethnography. But\nwhat I am trying to do here matters for politics; the tools that grow from\nattention to the ways the Runa relate to other kinds of beings can help think\npossibility and its realization differently. This, I hope, can speak to what\nGhassan Hage (2012) calls an “alter-politics”—a politics that grows not from\nopposition to or critique of our current systems but one that grows from\nattention to another way of being, one here that involves other kinds of\nliving beings.\n\nThis book, then, attempts to develop an analytic, which seeks to take\nanthropology “beyond the human” but without losing sight of the pressing ways\nin which we are also “all too human,” and how this too bears on living. The\nfirst step toward this endeavor, and the subject of the first chapter, “The\nOpen Whole,” is to rethink human language and its relationship to those other\nforms of representation we share with nonhuman beings. Whether or not it is\nexplicitly stated, language, and its unique properties, is what, according to\nso much of our social theory, defines us. Social or cultural systems, or even\n“actor-networks,” are ultimately understood in terms of their languagelike\nproperties. Like words, their “relata”—whether roles, ideas, or “actants”—do\nnot precede the mutually constitutive relationships these have with one\nanother in a system that necessarily comes to exhibit a certain circular\nclosure by virtue of this fact.[10](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn10)\n\nGiven so much of social theory’s emphasis on recognizing those unique sorts of\nlanguagelike phenomena responsible for such closure, I explore how, thanks to\nthe ways in which language is nested within broader forms of representation\nthat have their own distinctive properties, we are, in fact, open to the\nemerging worlds around us. In short, if culture is a “complex whole,” to quote\nE.B. Tylor’s (1871) foundational definition (a definition that invokes the\nways in which cultural ideas and social facts are mutually constituted by\nvirtue of the sociocultural systemic contexts that sustain them), then culture\nis also an “open whole.” The first chapter, then, constitutes a sort of\nethnography of signs beyond the human. It undertakes an ethnographic\nexploration of how humans and nonhumans use signs that are not necessarily\nsymbolic—that is, signs that are not conventional—and demonstrates why these\nsigns cannot be fully circumscribed by the symbolic.\n\nExploring how such aperture exists despite the very real fact of symbolic\nclosure forces us to rethink our assumptions about a foundational\nanthropological concept: context. The goal is to defamiliarize the\nconventional sign by revealing how it is just one of several semiotic\nmodalities and then to explore the very different nonsymbolic properties of\nthose other semiotic forms that are usually occluded by and collapsed into the\nsymbolic in anthropological analysis. An anthropology beyond the human is in\nlarge part about learning to appreciate how the human is also the product of\nthat which lies beyond human contexts.\n\nThose concerned with nonhumans have often tried to overcome the familiar\nCartesian divide between the symbolic realm of human meanings and the\nmeaningless realm of objects either by mixing the two—terms such as natures-\ncultures or material-semiotic are indicative of this—or by reducing one of\nthese poles to the other. By contrast, “The Open Whole” aims to show that the\nrecognition of representational processes as something unique to, and in a\nsense even synonymous with, life allows us to situate distinctively human ways\nof being in the world as both emergent from and in continuity with a broader\nliving semiotic realm.\n\nIf, as I argue, the symbolic is “open,” to what exactly does it open? Opening\nthe symbolic, through this exploration of signs beyond the symbolic, forces us\nto ponder what we might mean by the “real,” given that the hitherto secure\nfoundations for the real in anthropology—the “objective” and the contextually\nconstructed—are destabilized by the strange and hidden logics of those signs\nthat emerge, grow, and circulate in a world beyond the human.\n\nChapter 2, “The Living Thought,” considers the implications of the claim, laid\nout in chapter 1, that all beings, including those that are nonhuman, are\nconstitutively semiotic. All life is semiotic and all semiosis is alive. In\nimportant ways, then, life and thought are one and the same: life thinks;\nthoughts are alive.\n\nThis has implications for understanding who “we” are. Wherever there are\n“living thoughts” there is also a “self.” “Self,” at its most basic level, is\na product of semiosis. It is the locus—however rudimentary and ephemeral—of a\nliving dynamic by which signs come to represent the world around them to a\n“someone” who emerges as such as a result of this process. The world is thus\n“animate.” “We” are not the only kind of we.\n\nThe world is also “enchanted.” Thanks to this living semiotic dynamic, mean-\ning (i.e., means-ends relations, significance, “aboutness,” telos) is a\nconstitutive feature of the world and not just something we humans impose on\nit. Appreciating life and thought in this manner changes our understanding of\nwhat selves are and how they emerge, dissolve, and also merge into new kinds\nof we as they interact with the other beings that make the tropical forest\ntheir home in that complex web of relations that I call an “ecology of\nselves.”\n\nThe way Runa struggle to comprehend and enter this ecology of selves amplifies\nand makes apparent the peculiar logic of association by which living thoughts\nrelate. If, as Strathern (1995) has argued, anthropology is at base about “the\nRelation,” understanding some of the strange logics of association that emerge\nin this ecology of selves has important implications for our discipline. As we\nwill see, it reveals how indistinction figures as a central aspect of\nrelating. This changes our understandings of relationality; difference no\nlonger sits so easily at the foundation of our conceptual framework, and this\nchanges how we think about the central role that alterity plays in our\ndiscipline. A focus on this living semiotic dynamic in which indistinction\n(not to be confused with intrinsic similarity) operates also helps us see how\n“kinds” emerge in the world beyond the human. Kinds are not just human mental\ncategories, be these innate or conventional; they result from how beings\nrelate to each other in an ecology of selves in ways that involve a sort of\nconfusion.\n\nJust how to go about relating to those different beings that inhabit this vast\necology of selves poses pragmatic as well as existential challenges. Chapters\n3 and 4 examine ethnographically how the Runa deal with such challenges, and\nthese chapters reflect, more generally, on what we can learn from this.\n\nChapter 3, “Soul Blindness,” is about the general problem of how death is\nintrinsic to life. Hunting, fishing, and trapping place the Runa in a\nparticular relationship with the many beings that make up the ecology of\nselves in which they live. These activities force the Runa to assume their\npoints of view, and indeed to recognize that all these creatures that they\nhunt, as well as the many other creatures with which those hunted animals\nrelate, have points of view. It forces them to recognize that these creatures\ninhabit a network of relations that is predicated in part on the fact that its\nconstitutive members are living, thinking selves. The Runa enter this ecology\nof selves as selves. They hold that their ability to enter this web of\nrelations—to be aware of and to relate to other selves—depends on the fact\nthat they share this quality with the other beings that make up this ecology.\n\nBeing aware of the selfhood of the many beings that people the cosmos poses\nparticular challenges. The Runa enter the forest’s ecology of selves in order\nto hunt, which means that they recognize others as selves like themselves in\norder to turn them into nonselves. Objectification, then, is the flipside of\nanimism, and it is not a straightforward process. Furthermore, one’s ability\nto destroy other selves rests on and also highlights the fact that one is an\nephemeral self—a self that can all too quickly cease being a self. Under the\nrubric “soul blindness,” this chapter charts moments where this ability to\nrecognize other selves is lost and how this results in a sort of monadic\nalienation as one is, as a consequence, avulsed from the relational ecology of\nselves that constitutes the cosmos.\n\nThat death is intrinsic to life exemplifies something Cora Diamond (2008)\ncalls a “difficulty of reality.” It is a fundamental contradiction that can\noverwhelm us with its incomprehensibility. And this difficulty, as she\nemphasizes, is compounded by another one: such contradictions are at times,\nand for some, completely unremarkable. The feeling of disjunction that this\ncreates is also part of the difficulty of reality. Hunting in this vast\necology of selves in which one must stand as a self in relation to so many\nother kinds of selves who one then tries to kill brings such difficulties to\nthe fore; the entire cosmos reverberates with the contradictions intrinsic to\nlife.\n\nThis chapter, then, is about the death in life, but it is especially about\nsomething Stanley Cavell calls the “little deaths” of “everyday life” (Cavell\n2005: 128). There are many kinds and scales of death. There are many ways in\nwhich we cease being selves to ourselves and to each other. There are many\nways of being pulled out of relation and many occasions where we turn a blind\neye to and even kill relation. There are, in short, many modalities of\ndisenchantment. At times the horror of this everyday fact of our existence\nbursts into our lives, and thus becomes a difficulty of reality. At others it\nis simply ignored.\n\nChapter 4, “Trans-Species Pidgins,” is the second of these two chapters\nconcerned with the challenges posed by living in relation to so many kinds of\nselves in this vast ecology of selves. It focuses on the problem of how to\nsafely and successfully communicate with the many kinds of beings that people\nthe cosmos. How to understand and be understood by beings whose grasp of human\nlanguage is constantly in question is difficult in its own right. And when\nsuccessful, communication with these beings can be destabilizing.\nCommunication, to an extent, always involves communion. That is, communicating\nwith others entails some measure of what Haraway (2008) calls “becoming with”\nthese others. Although this promises to widen ways of being, it can also be\nvery threatening to a more distinctly human sense of self that the Runa,\ndespite this eagerness for expansion, also struggle to maintain. Accordingly,\npeople in Ávila find creative strategies to open channels of communication\nwith other beings in ways that also put brakes on these transgressive\nprocesses that can otherwise be so generative.\n\nMuch of this chapter focuses on the semiotic analysis of human attempts to\nunderstand and be understood by their dogs. For example, people in Ávila\nstruggle to interpret their dogs’ dreams, and they even give their dogs\nhallucinogens in order to be able to give them advice—in the process shifting\nto a sort of trans-species pidgin with unexpected properties.\n\nThe human-dog relation is special in part because of the way it links up to\nother relations. With and through their dogs people connect both to the\nbroader forest ecology of selves and to an all-too-human social world that\nstretches beyond Ávila and its surrounding forests and that also catches up\nlayers of colonial legacies. This chapter and the two that follow consider\nrelationality in this expanded sense. They are concerned not just with how the\nRuna relate to the forest’s living creatures but also with how the Runa relate\nto its spirits as well as to the many powerful human beings who have left\ntheir traces on the landscape.\n\nHow the Runa relate to their dogs, to the living creatures of the forest, to\nits ethereal but real spirits, and to the various other figures—the estate\nbosses, the priests, the colonists—that over the course of time have come to\npeople their world cannot be distentangled. They are all part of this ecology\nthat makes the Runa who they are. Nonetheless, I resist the temptation to\ntreat this relational knot as an irreducible complexity. There is something we\ncan learn about all these relations—and relationality more broadly—by paying\ncareful attention to the specific modalities through which communication is\nattempted with different kinds of beings. These struggles to communicate\nreveal certain formal properties of relation—a certain logic of association, a\nset of constraints—that are neither the contingent products of earthly\nbiologies nor those of human histories but which are instantiated in, and thus\ngive shape to, both.\n\nThe property that most interests me here is hierarchy. The life of signs is\ncharacterized by a host of unidirectional and nested logical\nproperties—properties that are consummately hierarchical. And yet, in the\nhopeful politics we seek to cultivate, we privilege heterarchy over hierarchy,\nthe rhizomatic over the arborescent, and we celebrate the fact that such\nhorizontal processes—lateral gene transfer, symbiosis, commensalism, and the\nlike—can be found in the nonhuman living world. I believe this is the wrong\nway to ground politics. Morality, like the symbolic, emerges within—not\nbeyond—the human. Projecting our morality, which rightfully privileges\nequality, on a relational landscape composed in part of nested and\nunidirectional associations of a logical and ontological, but not a moral,\nnature is a form of anthropocentric narcissism that renders us blind to some\nof the properties of that world beyond the human. As a consequence it makes us\nincapable of harnessing them politically. Part of the interest of this\nchapter, then, lies in charting how such nested relations get caught up and\ndeployed in moral worlds without themselves being the products of those moral\nworlds.\n\nThe fifth chapter, “Form’s Effortless Efficacy,” is the place where I flesh\nout this account—to which I have heretofore been alluding—of the\nanthropological significance of form. That is, it is about how specific\nconfigurations of limits on possibility emerge in this world, the peculiar\nmanner in which these redundancies propagate, and the ways in which they come\nto matter to lives, human and otherwise, in the forests around Ávila.\n\nForm is difficult to treat anthropologically. Neither mind nor mechanism, it\ndoesn’t easily fit the dualistic metaphysics we inherit from the\nEnlightenment—a metaphysics that even today, in ways we may not necessarily\nalways notice, steers us toward seeing cause in terms either of mechanistic\npushes and pulls or of the meanings, purposes, and desires that we have\ngenerally come to relegate to the realm of the human. Much of the book so far\nhas been concerned with dismantling some of the more persistent legacies of\nthis dualism by tracing the implications of recognizing that meaning, broadly\ndefined, is part and parcel of the living world beyond the human. This\nchapter, by contrast, seeks to further this endeavor by going beyond not only\nthe human but also life. It is about the strange properties of pattern\npropagation that exceed life despite the fact that such patterns are\nharnessed, nurtured, and amplified by life. In a tropical forest teeming with\nso many forms of life these patterns proliferate to an unprecedented degree.\nTo engage with the forest on its terms, to enter its relational logic, to\nthink with its thoughts, one must become attuned to these.\n\nBy “form” here, I’m not, then, referring to the conceptual structures—innate\nor learned—through which we humans apprehend the world, nor am I referring to\nan ideal Platonic realm. Rather, I am referring to a strange but nonetheless\nworldly process of pattern production and propagation, a process Deacon (2006,\n2012) characterizes as “morphodynamic”—one whose peculiar generative logic\nnecessarily comes to permeate living beings (human and nonhuman) as they\nharness it.\n\nEven though form is not mind it is not thinglike either. Another difficulty\nfor anthropology is that form lacks the tangible otherness of a standard\nethnographic object. When one is inside it there is nothing against which to\npush; it cannot be defined by the way it resists. It is not amenable to this\nkind of palpation, to this way of knowing. It is also fragile and ephemeral.\nLike the vortices of the whirlpools that sometimes form in the swift-flowing\nAmazonian headwaters, it simply vanishes when the special geometry of\nconstraints that sustains it disappears. It thus remains largely hidden from\nour standard modes of analysis.\n\nThrough the examination of a variety of ethnographic, historical, and\nbiological examples summoned together in an attempt to make sense of a\npuzzling dream I had about my relation to some of the animals of the forest\nand the spirit masters that control them, this chapter tries to understand\nsome of the peculiar properties of form. It tries to understand the ways form\ndoes something to cause-and-effect temporality and the ways it comes to\nexhibit its own kind of “effortless efficacy” as it propagates itself through\nus. I am particularly interested here in how the logic of form affects the\nlogic of living thoughts. What happens to thought when it is freed from its\nown intentions, when, in Lévi-Strauss’s words, we ask of it no return (Lévi-\nStrauss 1966: 219)? What kinds of ecologies does it sound, and, in the\nprocess, what new kinds of relations does it make possible?\n\nThis chapter is also, nonetheless, concerned with the very practical problem\nof getting inside form and doing something with it. The wealth of the\nforest—be it game or extractive commodities—accumulates in a patterned way.\nAccessing it requires finding ways to enter the logic of these patterns.\nAccordingly, this chapter also charts the various techniques, shamanic and\notherwise, used to do this, and it also attends to the painful sense of\nalienation the Runa feel when they are unable to enter the many new forms that\nhave come over time to serve as the reservoirs for so much power and wealth.\n\nRethinking cause through form forces us to rethink agency as well. What is\nthis strange way of getting something done without doing anything at all? What\nkinds of politics can come into being through this particular way of creating\nassociations? Grasping how form emerges and propagates in the forest and in\nthe lives of those who relate to it—be they river dolphins, hunters, or rubber\nbosses—and understanding something about form’s effortless efficacy is central\nto developing an anthropology that can attend to those many processes central\nto life, human and nonhuman, which are not built from quanta of difference.\n\nHow Forests Think is a book, ultimately, about thought. It is, to quote\nViveiros de Castro, a call to make anthropology a practice for “la\ndécolonisation permanente de la pensée” (Viveiros de Castro 2009: 4). My\nargument is that we are colonized by certain ways of thinking about\nrelationality. We can only imagine the ways in which selves and thoughts might\nform associations through our assumptions about the forms of associations that\nstructure human language. And then, in ways that often go unnoticed, we\nproject these assumptions onto nonhumans. Without realizing it we attribute to\nnonhumans properties that are our own, and then, to compound this, we\nnarcissistically ask them to provide us with corrective reflections of\nourselves.\n\nSo, how should we think with forests? How should we allow the thoughts in and\nof the nonhuman world to liberate our thinking? Forests are good to think\nbecause they themselves think. Forests think. I want to take this seriously,\nand I want to ask, What are the implications of this claim for our\nunderstandings of what it means to be human in a world that extends beyond us?\n\nWait. How can I even make this claim that forests think? Shouldn’t we only ask\nhow people think forests think? I’m not doing this. Here, instead, is my\nprovocation. I want to show that the fact that we can make the claim that\nforests think is in a strange way a product of the fact that forests think.\nThese two things—the claim itself and the claim that we can make the claim—are\nrelated: It is because thought extends beyond the human that we can think\nbeyond the human.\n\nThis book, then, aims to free our thinking of that excess conceptual baggage\nthat has accumulated as a result of our exclusive attention—to the neglect of\neverything else—to that which makes us humans exceptional. How Forests Think\ndevelops a method for crafting new conceptual tools out of the unexpected\nproperties of the world beyond the human that we discover ethnographically.\nAnd in so doing it seeks to liberate us from our own mental enclosures. As we\nlearn to attend ethnographically to that which lies beyond the human, certain\nstrange phenomena suddenly come to the fore, and these strange phenomena\namplify, and in the process come to exemplify, some of the general properties\nof the world in which we live. If through this form of analysis we can find\nways to further amplify these phenomena, we can then cultivate them as\nconcepts and mobilize them as tools. By methodologically privileging\namplification over, say, comparison or reduction we can create a somewhat\ndifferent anthropology, one that can help us understand how we might better\nlive in a world we share with other kinds of lives.\n\nThe logics of living dynamics, and the sorts of ancillary phenomena these both\ncreate and catch up, might at first appear strange and counterintuitive. But,\nas I hope to show, they also permeate our everyday lives, and they might help\nus understand our lives differently if we could just learn to listen for them.\nThis emphasis on defamiliarization—coming to see the strange as familiar so\nthat the familiar appears strange—calls to mind a long anthropological\ntradition that focuses on how an appreciation for context (historical, social,\ncultural) destabilizes what we take to be natural and immutable modes of\nbeing. And yet, when compared to the distance-making practices associated with\nmore traditional liberatory ethnographic or genealogical exercises, seeing the\nhuman from somewhat beyond the human does not merely destabilize the taken for\ngranted; it changes the very terms of analysis and comparison.\n\nThis reach beyond the human changes our understanding of foundational\nanalytical concepts such as context but also others, such as representation,\nrelation, self, ends, difference, similarity, life, the real, mind, person,\nthought, form, finitude, future, history, cause, agency, relation, hierarchy,\nand generality. It changes what we mean by these terms and where we locate the\nphenomena to which they refer, as well as our understanding of the effects\nsuch phenomena have in the living world in which we live.\n\nThe final chapter, “The Living Future (and the Imponderable Weight of the\nDead),” builds on this way of thinking with forests that I develop in this\nbook as it takes as its focus another enigmatic dream, in this case one of a\nhunter who is not sure if he is the rapacious predator (who appears here as a\nwhite policeman) or the helpless prey of his oneiric prophecy. The\ninterpretive dilemma that this dream poses, and the existential and psychic\nconflict that it thus lays bare, concerns how to continue as a self and what\nsuch continuity might mean in the ecology of selves in which the Runa live—an\necology that is firmly rooted in a forest realm that reaches well beyond the\nhuman but which also catches up in its tendrils the detritus of so many all-\ntoo-human pasts. This chapter, more broadly, is about survival. That is, it is\nabout the relation of continuity and growth to absence. Ethnographic attention\nto the problem of survival in the particular colonially inflected ecology of\nselves in which the Runa live tells us something more general about how we\nmight become new kinds of we, in relation to such absences, and how, in this\nprocess, “we” might, to use Haraway’s (2008) term, “flourish.”\n\nUnderstanding this dream and what it can tell us about survival calls for a\nshift, not only regarding anthropology’s object—the human—but also regarding\nits temporal focus. It asks us to recognize more generally how life—human and\nnonhuman—is not just the product of the weight of the past on the present but\nhow it is also the product of the curious and convoluted ways in which the\nfuture comes to bear upon a present.\n\nThat is, all semiotic processes are organized around the fact that signs\nrepresent a future possible state of affairs. The future matters to living\nthoughts. It is a constitutive feature of any kind of self. The life of signs\nis not, then, just in the present but also in a vague and possible future.\nSigns are oriented toward the ways in which future signs will likely represent\ntheir relationship to a likely state of affairs. Selves, then, are\ncharacterized by what Peirce calls a “being in futuro” (CP 2.86), or a “living\nfuture” (CP 8.194).[11](Notes.xhtml#intro1fn11) This particular kind of\ncausality, whereby a future comes to affect the present via the mediation of\nsigns, is unique to life.\n\nIn the life of signs future is also closely related to absence. All kinds of\nsigns in some way or other re-present what is not present. And every\nsuccessful representation has another absence at its foundation; it is the\nproduct of the history of all the other sign processes that less accurately\nrepresented what would be. What one is as a semiotic self, then, is\nconstitutively related to what one is not. One’s future emerges from and in\nrelation to a specific geometry of absent histories. Living futures are always\n“indebted” to the dead that surround them.\n\nAt some level this way in which life creates future in negative but\nconstitutive relation to all its pasts is characteristic of all semiotic\nprocesses. But it is a dynamic that is amplified in the tropical forest, with\nits unprecedented layers of mutually constitutive representational\nrelationships. Runa engagements with this complex ecology of selves create\neven more future.\n\nChapter 6, then, is primarily concerned with one particular manifestation of\nthis future: the realm of the afterlife located deep in the forest and\ninhabited by the dead and the spirit masters that control the forest’s\nanimals. This realm is the product of the relationship that invisible futures\nhave to the painful histories of the dead that make life possible. Around\nÁvila these dead take the form of were-jaguars, masters, demons, and the\nspecters of so many pre-Hispanic, colonial, and republican pasts; all these\ncontinue, in their own ways, to haunt the living forest.\n\nThis chapter traces how this ethereal future realm relates to the concrete one\nof everyday Runa existence. The Runa, living in relation to the forest’s vast\necology of selves, also live their lives with one foot in futuro. That is,\nthey live their lives with one foot in the spirit realm that is the emergent\nproduct of the ways in which they engage with the futures and the pasts that\nthe forest comes to harbor in its relational webs. This other kind of\n“beyond,” this after-life, this super-nature, is not exactly natural (or\ncultural), but it is nonetheless real. It is its own kind of irreducible real,\nwith its own distinctive properties and its own tangible effects in a future\npresent.\n\nThe fractured and yet necessary relationship between the mundane present and\nthe vague future plays out in specific and painful ways in what Lisa Stevenson\n(2012; see also Butler 1997) might call the psychic life of the Runa self,\nimmersed and informed as it is by the ecology of selves in which it lives. The\nRuna are both of and alienated from the spirit world, and survival requires\ncultivating ways to allow something of one’s future self—living tenuously in\nthe spirit realm of the forest masters—to look back on and call out to that\nmore mundane part of oneself that might then hopefully respond. This ethereal\nrealm of continuity and possibility is the emergent product of a whole host of\ntrans-species and transhistorical relations. It is the product of the\nimponderable weight of the many dead that make a living future possible.\n\nThat hunter’s challenge of surviving as an I, as it was revealed in his dream\nand as it plays out in this ecology of selves, depends on how he is hailed by\nothers—others that may be human or nonhuman, fleshly or virtual. It also\ndepends on how he responds. Is he the white policeman who might turn on his\nRuna neighbors with a blood thirst that terrifies him? Is he helpless prey? Or\nmight he not be a runa puma, a were-jaguar, capable, even, of returning a\njaguar’s gaze?\n\nLet this runa puma, this one who both is and is not us, be, like Dante’s\nVirgil, our guide as we wander this “dense and difficult” forest—this “selva\nselvaggia” where words so often fail us. Let this runa puma guide us with the\nhope that we too may learn another way to attend and respond to the many lives\nof those selves that people this sylvatic realm.\n\n\n![](images/img_0006.jpg)\n\nONE\n\n* * *\n\nThe Open Whole\n\nBy a feeling I mean an instance of that sort of element of consciousness which\nis all that it is positively, in itself, regardless of anything else. . . .\n[A] feeling is absolutely simple and without parts—as it evidently is, since\nit is whatever it is regardless of anything else, and therefore regardless of\nany part, which would be something other than the whole.\n\n—Charles Peirce, The Collected Papers 1.306–10\n\nOne evening while the grown-ups gathered around the hearth drinking manioc\nbeer, Maxi, settling back to a quieter corner of the house, began to tell his\nteenage neighbor Luis and me about some of his recent adventures and mishaps.\nFifteen or so and just beginning to hunt on his own, he told us of the day he\nstood out in the forest for what seemed an eternity, waiting for something to\nhappen, and how, all of a sudden, he found himself close to a herd of collared\npeccaries moving through the underbrush. Frightened, he hoisted himself into\nthe safety of a little tree and from there fired on and hit one of the pigs.\nThe wounded animal ran off toward a little river and . . . “tsupu.”\n\nTsupu. I’ve deliberately left Maxi’s utterance untranslated. What might it\nmean? What does it sound like?\n\nTsupu, or tsupuuuh, as it is sometimes pronounced, with the final vowel\ndragged out and aspirated, refers to an entity as it makes contact with and\nthen penetrates a body of water; think of a big stone heaved into a pond or\nthe compact mass of a wounded peccary plunging into a river’s pool. Tsupu\nprobably did not immediately conjure such an image (unless you speak lowland\nEcuadorian Quichua). But what did you feel upon learning what it describes?\nOnce I tell people what tsupu means, they often experience a sudden feel for\nits meaning: “Oh, of course, tsupu!”\n\nBy contrast, I would venture that even after learning that the greeting\n“causanguichu,” used when encountering someone who hasn’t been seen in a long\ntime, means “Are you still alive?” you don’t have such a feeling. Causanguichu\ncertainly feels like what it means to native speakers of Quichua, and over the\nyears I too have come to develop a feel for its meaning. But what is it about\ntsupu that causes its meaning to feel so evident even for many people who\ndon’t speak Quichua? Tsupu somehow feels like a pig plunging into water.\n\nHow is it that tsupu means? We know that a word like causanguichu means by\nvirtue of the ways in which it is inextricably embedded, through a dense\nhistorically contingent tangle of grammatical and syntactic relations, with\nother such words in that uniquely human system of communication we call\nlanguage. And we know that what it means also depends on the ways in which\nlanguage is itself caught up in broader social, cultural, and political\ncontexts, which share similar historically contingent systemic properties. In\norder to develop a feel for causanguichu we have to grasp something of the\ntotality of the interrelated network of words in which it exists. We also need\nto grasp something of the broader social context in which it is and has been\nused. Making sense of how we live inside these kinds of changing contexts that\nwe both make and that make us has long been an important goal of anthropology.\nFor anthropology the “human,” as a being and an object of knowledge, emerges\nonly by attending to how we are embedded in these uniquely human\ncontexts—these “complex wholes” as E.B. Tylor’s (1871) classic definition of\nculture terms them.\n\nBut if causanguichu is firmly in language, tsupu seems somehow outside it.\nTsupu is a sort of paralinguistic parasite on the language that somewhat\nindifferently bears it. Tsupu is, in a way, as Peirce might say, “all that it\nis positively, in itself, regardless of anything else.” And this admittedly\nminor fact, that this strange little quasi-word is not quite made by its\nlinguistic context, troubles the anthropological project of making sense of\nthe human via context.\n\nTake causanguichu’s root, the lexeme causa-, which is marked for person and\ninflected by a suffix that signals its status as a question:\n\n> causa-ngui-chu\n>\n> live-2-INTER[1](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn1)\n>\n> Are you still alive?\n\nThrough its grammatical inflections causanguichu is inextricably related to\nthe other words that make up the Quichua language. Tsupu, by contrast, doesn’t\nreally interact with other words and therefore can’t be modified to reflect\nany such possible relations. Being “all that it is positively in itself,” it\ncan’t even be grammatically negated. What kind of thing, then, is tsupu? Is it\neven a word? What does its anomalous place in language reveal about language?\nAnd what can it tell us about the anthropological project of grasping the\nvarious ways in which linguistic as well as sociocultural and historical\ncontexts form the conditions of possibility both for human life and for our\nways of attending to it?\n\nAlthough not exactly a word, tsupu certainly is a sign. That is, it certainly\nis, as the philosopher Charles Peirce put it, “something which stands to\nsomebody for something in some respect or capacity” (CP 2.228). This is quite\ndifferent from Saussure’s (1959) more humanist treatment of signs with which\nwe anthropologists tend to be more familiar. For Saussure human language is\nthe paragon and model for all sign systems (1959: 68). Peirce’s definition of\na sign, by contrast, is much more agnostic about what signs are and what kinds\nof beings use them; for him not all signs have languagelike properties, and,\nas I discuss below, not all the beings who use them are human. This broader\ndefinition of the sign helps us become attuned to the life signs have beyond\nthe human as we know it.\n\nTsupu captures to some extent and in some particular way something of a pig\nplunging into water, and it does so—weirdly—not just for Quichua speakers, but\nto some degree for those of us who may not have any familiarity with the\nlanguage that carries it along.[2](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn2) What might paying\nattention to this not-quite-wordlike-kind-of-sign reveal? Feeling tsupu, “in\nitself, regardless of anything else,” can tell us something important about\nthe nature of language and its unexpected openings toward the world “itself.”\nAnd insofar as it can help us understand how signs are not just bounded by\nhuman contexts, but how they also reach beyond them. Insofar, that is, as it\ncan help reveal how signs are also in, of, and about other sensuous worlds\nthat we too can feel, it can also tell us something about how we can move\nbeyond understanding the human in terms of the “complex wholes” that make us\nwho we are. In sum, appreciating what it might mean “to live” (Quichua causa-\nngapa) in worlds that are open to that which extends beyond the human might\njust allow us to become a little more “worldly.”[3](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn3)\n\nIN AND OF THE WORLD\n\nIn uttering “tsupu,” Maxi brought home something that happened in the forest.\nInsofar as Luis, or I, or you, feel tsupu we come to grasp something of Maxi’s\nexperience of being near a wounded pig plunging into a pool of water. And we\ncan come to have this feeling even if we weren’t in the forest that day. All\nsigns, and not just tsupu, are in some way or another about the world in this\nsense. They “re-present.” They are about something not immediately present.\n\nBut they are also all, in some way or another, in and of the world. When we\nthink of situations in which we use signs to represent an event, such as the\none I’ve just described, this quality may be hard to see. Sitting back in a\ndark corner of a thatched roof house listening to Maxi talk about the forest\nis not the same as having been present to that pig plunging into water. Isn’t\nthis “radical discontinuity” with the world another important hallmark of\nsigns?[4](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn4) Insofar as signs do not provide any sort of\nimmediate, absolute, or certain purchase on the entities they represent, it\ncertainly is. But the fact that signs always mediate does not mean that they\nalso necessarily exist in some separate domain inside (human) minds and cut\noff from the entities they stand for. As I will show, they are not just about\nthe world. They are also in important ways in it.\n\nConsider the following. Toward the end of a day spent walking in the forest,\nHilario, his son Lucio, and I came upon a troop of woolly monkeys moving\nthrough the canopy. Lucio shot and killed one, and the rest of the troop\ndispersed. One young monkey, however, became separated from the troop. Finding\nherself alone she hid in the branches of an enormous red-trunked tree that\npoked out of the forest canopy high above.[5](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn5)\n\nIn the hope of startling the monkey into moving to a more visible perch so\nthat his son could shoot it Hilario decided to fell a nearby palm tree:\n\n> look out!\n>\n> ta ta\n>\n> I’ll make it go pu oh\n>\n> watch out![6](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn6)\n\nTa ta and pu oh, like tsupu, are images that sound like what they mean. Ta ta\nis an image of chopping: tap tap. Pu oh captures the process by which a tree\nfalls. The snap that initiates its toppling, the swish of the crown free-\nfalling through layers of forest canopy, and the crash and its echoes as it\nhits the ground are all enfolded in this sonic image.\n\nHilario then went and did what he said. He walked off a little way and with\nhis machete began chopping rhythmically at a palm tree. The tapping of steel\nagainst trunk is clearly audible on the recording I made in the forest that\nafternoon (ta ta ta ta . . . )—as was the palm crashing down (pu oh).\n\nLowland Quichua has hundreds of “words” like ta ta, pu oh, and tsupu that mean\nby virtue of the ways in which they sonically convey an image of how an action\nunfolds in the world. They are ubiquitous in speech, especially in forest\ntalk. A testament to their importance to Runa ways of being in the world is\nthat the linguistic anthropologist Janis Nuckolls (1996) has written an entire\nbook—titled, appropriately, Sounds Like Life—about them.\n\nA “word” such as tsupu is like the entity it represents thanks to the ways in\nwhich the differences between the “sign vehicle” (i.e., the entity that is\ntaken as a sign, in this case the sonic quality of\ntsupu)[7](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn7) and the object (in this case the plunging-into-\nwater that this “word” simulates) are ignored.[8](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn8) Peirce\ncalled these kinds of signs of likeness “icons.” They conform to the first of\nhis three broad classes of signs.\n\nAs Hilario had anticipated, the sound of the palm tree crashing frightened the\nmonkey from her perch. This event itself, and not just its before-the-fact\nimitation, can also be taken as a kind of sign. It is a sign in the sense that\nit too came to be “something which stands to somebody for something in some\nrespect or capacity.” In this case the “somebody” to whom this sign stands is\nnot human. The palm crashing down stands for something to the monkey.\nSignificance is not the exclusive province of humans because we are not the\nonly ones who interpret signs. That other kinds of beings use signs is one\nexample of the ways in which representation exists in the world beyond human\nminds and human systems of meaning.\n\nThe palm crashing down becomes significant in a way that differs from its\nimitation pu oh.[9](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn9) Pu oh is iconic in the sense that it,\nin itself, is in some respect like its object. That is, it functions as an\nimage when we fail to notice the differences between it and the event that it\nrepresents. It means due to a certain kind of absence of attention to\ndifference. By ignoring the myriad characteristics that make any entity\nunique, a very restricted set of characteristics is amplified, here by virtue\nof the fact that the sound that simulates the action also happens to share\nthese characteristics.\n\nThe crashing palm itself comes to signify something for the monkey in another\ncapacity. The crash, as sign, is not a likeness of the object it represents.\nInstead, it points to something else. Peirce calls this sort of sign an\n“index.” Indices constitute his second broad class of signs.\n\nBefore exploring indices further, I want to briefly introduce the\n“symbol”—Peirce’s third kind of sign. Unlike iconic and indexical modes of\nreference, which form the bases for all representation in the living world,\nsymbolic reference is, on this planet at least, a form of representation that\nis unique to humans. Accordingly, as anthropologists of the human we are most\nfamiliar with its distinctive properties. Symbols refer, not simply through\nthe similarity of icons, or solely through the pointing of indices. Rather, as\nwith the word causanguichu, they refer to their object indirectly by virtue of\nthe ways in which they relate systemically to other such symbols. Symbols\ninvolve convention. This is why causanguichu only means—and comes to feel\nmeaningful—by virtue of the established system of relationships it has with\nother words in Quichua.\n\nThe palm that Hilario sent crashing down that afternoon startled the monkey.\nAs an index it forced her to notice that something just happened, even though\nwhat just happened remained unclear.[10](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn10) Whereas icons\ninvolve not noticing, indices focus the attention. If icons are what they are\n“in themselves” regardless of the existence of the entity they represent,\nindices involve facts “themselves.” Whether or not someone was there to hear\nit, whether or not the monkey, or anyone else for that matter, took this\noccurrence to be significant, the palm, itself, still came crashing down.\n\nUnlike icons, which represent by virtue of the resemblances they share with\nobjects, indices represent “by virtue of real connections to them” (Peirce\n1998c: 461; see also CP 2.248). Tugging on the stems of woody vines, or\nlianas, that extend up into the canopy is another strategy to scare monkeys\nout of their hidden perches (see frontispiece, this chapter). To the extent\nthat such an action can startle a monkey it is because of a chain of “real\nconnections” among disparate things: the hunter’s tug is transmitted, via the\nliana, high up to the tangled mat of epiphytes, lianas, moss, and detritus\nthat accumulates to form the perch atop which the hiding monkey sits.\n\nAlthough one might say that the hunter’s tug, propagated through the liana and\nmat, literally shakes the monkey out of her sense of security, how this monkey\ncomes to take this tug as a sign cannot be reduced to a deterministic chain of\ncauses and effects. The monkey need not necessarily perceive the shaking perch\nto be a sign of anything. And in the event that she does, her reaction will be\nsomething other than the effect of the force of the tug propagated up the\nlength of the liana.\n\nIndices involve something more than mechanical efficiency. That something more\nis, paradoxically, something less. It is an absence. That is, to the extent\nthat indices are noticed they impel their interpreters to make connections\nbetween some event and another potential one that has not yet occurred. A\nmonkey takes the moving perch, as sign, to be connected to something else, for\nwhich it stands. It is connected to something dangerously different from her\npresent sense of security. Maybe the branch she is perched on is going to\nbreak off. Maybe a jaguar is climbing up the tree . . . Something is about to\nhappen, and she had better do something about it. Indices provide information\nabout such absent futures. They encourage us to make a connection between what\nis happening and what might potentially happen.\n\nLIVING SIGNS\n\nAsking whether signs involve sound images like tsupu, or whether they come to\nmean through events like a palm crashing down, or whether their sense emerges\nin some more systemic and distributed manner, like the interrelated network of\nwords printed on the pages that make up this book, might encourage us to think\nabout signs in terms of the differences in their tangible qualities. But signs\nare more than things. They don’t squarely reside in sounds, events, or words.\nNor are they exactly in bodies or even minds. They can’t be precisely located\nin this way because they are ongoing relational processes. Their sensuous\nqualities are only one part of the dynamic through which they come to be, to\ngrow, and to have effects in the world.\n\nIn other words signs are alive. A crashing palm tree—taken as sign—is alive\ninsofar as it can grow. It is alive insofar as it will come to be interpreted\nby a subsequent sign in a semiotic chain that extends into the possible\nfuture.\n\nThe startled monkey’s jump to a higher perch is a part of this living semiotic\nchain. It is what Peirce called an “interpretant,” a new sign that interprets\nthe way in which a prior sign relates to its object.[11](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn11)\nInterpretants can be further specified through an ongoing process of sign\nproduction and interpretation that increasingly captures something about the\nworld and increasingly orients an interpreting self toward this aboutness.\nSemiosis is the name for this living sign process through which one thought\ngives rise to another, which in turn gives rise to another, and so on, into\nthe potential future.[12](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn12) It captures the way in which\nliving signs are not just in the here and now but also in the realm of the\npossible.\n\nAlthough semiosis is something more than mechanical efficiency, thinking is\nnot just confined to some separate realm of ideas.[13](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn13) A\nsign has an effect, and this, precisely, is what an interpretant is. It is the\n“proper significate effect that the sign produces” (CP 5.475). The monkey’s\njump, sparked by her reaction to a crashing palm, amounts to an interpretant\nof a prior sign of danger. It makes visible an energetic component that is\ncharacteristic of all sign processes, even those that might seem purely\n“mental.”[14](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn14) Although semiosis is something more than\nenergetics and materiality, all sign processes eventually “do things” in the\nworld, and this is an important part of what makes them\nalive.[15](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn15)\n\nSigns don’t come from the mind. Rather, it is the other way around. What we\ncall mind, or self, is a product of semiosis. That “somebody,” human or\nnonhuman, who takes the crashing palm to be significant is a “self that is\njust coming into life in the flow of time” (CP 5.421) by virtue of the ways in\nwhich she comes to be a locus—however ephemeral—for the “interpretance” of\nthis sign and many others like it. In fact, Peirce coined the cumbersome term\ninterpretant to avoid the “homunculus fallacy” (see Deacon 2012: 48) of seeing\na self as a sort of black box (a little person inside us, a homunculus) who\nwould be the interpreter of those signs but not herself the product of those\nsigns. Selves, human or nonhuman, simple or complex, are outcomes of semiosis\nas well as the starting points for new sign interpretation whose outcome will\nbe a future self. They are waypoints in a semiotic process.\n\nThese selves, “just coming into life,” are not shut off from the world; the\nsemiosis occurring “inside” the mind is not intrinsically different from that\nwhich occurs among minds. That palm crashing down in the forest illustrates\nthis living worldly semiosis as it is embedded in an ecology of disparate\nemerging selves. Hilario’s iconic simulation of a falling palm charts a\npossible future that then becomes realized in a palm that he actually fells.\nIts crash, in turn, is interpreted by another being whose life will change\nthanks to the way she takes this as a sign of something upon which she must\nact. What emerges is a highly mediated but nevertheless unbroken chain that\njumps from the realm of human speech to that of human bodies and their\nactions, and from these to events-in-the-world such as a tree crashing down\nthat these realized embodied intentions actualize, and from here to the\nequally physical reaction that the semiotic interpretation of this event\nprovokes in another kind of primate high up in a tree. The crashing palm and\nthe human who felled it came to affect the monkey, notwithstanding their\nphysical separation from her. Signs have worldly effects even though they are\nnot reducible to physical cause-and-effect.\n\nSuch tropical trans-species attempts at communication reveal the living\nworldly nature of semiosis. All semiosis (and by extension thought) takes\nplace in minds-in-the-world. To highlight this characteristic of semiosis this\nis how Peirce described the thought practices of Antoine Lavoisier, the\neighteenth-century French aristocrat and founder of the modern field of\nchemistry:\n\n> Lavoisier’s method was . . . to dream that some long and complicated\n> chemical process would have a certain effect, to put it into practice with\n> dull patience, after its inevitable failure, to dream that with some\n> modification it would have another result, and to end by publishing the last\n> dream as a fact: his way was to carry his mind into his laboratory, and\n> literally to make of his alembics and cucurbits instruments of thought,\n> giving a new conception of reasoning as something which was to be done with\n> one’s eyes open, in manipulating real things instead of words and fancies.\n> (CP 5.363)\n\nWhere would we locate Lavoisier’s thoughts and dreams? Where, if not in this\nemerging world of blown glass cucurbits and alembics and the mixtures\ncontained in their carefully delimited spaces of absence and possibility, is\nhis mind, and future self, coming in to being?\n\nABSENCES\n\nLavoisier’s blown glass flasks point to another important element of semiosis.\nLike these curiously shaped receptacles, signs surely have an important\nmateriality: they possess sensuous qualities; they are instantiated with\nrespect to the bodies that produce and are produced by them; and they can make\na difference in the worlds that they are about. And yet, like the space\ndelimited by the walls of the flask, signs are also in important ways\nimmaterial. A glass flask is as much about what it is as it is about what it\nis not; it is as much about the vessel blown into form by the glassmaker—and\nall the material qualities and technological, political, and socioeconomic\nhistories that made that act of creation possible—as it is about the specific\ngeometry of absence that it comes to delimit. Certain kinds of reactions can\ntake place in that flask because of all the others that are excluded from it.\n\nThis kind of absence is central to the semiosis that sustains and instantiates\nlife and mind. It is apparent in what played out in the forest that afternoon\nas we were out hunting monkeys. Now that that young woolly monkey had moved to\na more exposed perch Lucio tried to shoot at it with his muzzle-loading black\npowder shotgun. But when he pulled the trigger the hammer simply clicked down\non the firing cap. Lucio quickly replaced the defective cap and reloaded—this\ntime packing the barrel with an extra dose of lead shot. When the monkey\nclimbed to an even more exposed position, Hilario encouraged his son to fire\nagain: “Hurry, now really!” Wary of the precarious nature of his firearm,\nhowever, Lucio first uttered, “teeeye.”\n\n![](images/img_0007.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 4. A muzzle-loading shotgun (illapa). Photo by author.\n\nTeeeye, like tsupu, ta ta, and pu oh, is an image in sound. It is iconic of a\ngun successfully firing and hitting its target. The mouth that pronounces it\nis like a flask that assumes the various shapes of a firing gun. First the\ntongue taps on the palette to produce the stopped consonant the way a hammer\nstrikes a firing cap. Then the mouth opens ever wider as it pronounces the\nexpanding elongated vowel, the way lead shot, propelled by the explosion of\npowder ignited by the cap, sprays out of the barrel (figure 4).\n\nMoments later Lucio pulled the trigger. And this time, with a deafening\nteeeye, the gun fired.\n\nTeeeye is, at many levels, a product of what it is not. The shape of the mouth\neffectively eliminates all the many other sounds that could have been made as\nbreath is voiced. What is left is a sound that “fits” the object it represents\nthanks to the many sounds that are absent. The object that is not physically\npresent constitutes a second absence. Finally, teeeye involves another absence\nin the sense that it is a representation of a future brought into the present\nin the hopes that this not-yet will affect the present. Lucio hopes his gun\nwill successfully fire teeeye when he pulls the trigger. He imported this\nsimulation into the present from the possible world that he hopes will come to\nbe. This future-possible, which orients Lucio toward taking all the steps\nneeded to make this future possible, is also a constitutive absence. What\nteeeye is—its significate effect, in short, its meaning—is dependent on all\nthese things that it is not.\n\nAll signs, and not just those we might call magical, traffic in the future in\nthe way that teeeye does. They are calls to act in the present through an\nabsent but re-presented future that, by virtue of this call, can then come to\naffect the present; “Hurry, now really,” as Hilario implored his son moments\nbefore he fired his gun, involves a prediction that there will still be an\n“it” up there to shoot. It is a call from the future as re-presented in the\npresent.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu and his\nreflection on how the hole at the hub is what makes a wheel useful, Terrence\nDeacon (2006) refers to the special kind of nothingness delimited by the\nspokes of a wheel, or by the glass of a flask, or by the shape of the mouth\nwhen uttering “teeeye” as a “constitutive absence.” Constitutive absence,\naccording to Deacon, is not just found in the world of artifacts or humans. It\nis a kind of relation to that which is spatially or temporally not present\nthat is crucial to biology and to any kind of self (see Deacon 2012: 3). It\npoints to the peculiar way in which, “in the world of mind, nothing—that which\nis not—can be a cause” (Bateson 2000a: 458, quoted in Deacon 2006).\n\nAs I discuss later in this chapter, and in subsequent ones as well,\nconstitutive absence is central to evolutionary processes. That, for example,\na lineage of organisms comes to increasingly fit a particular environment is\nthe result of the “absence” of all the other lineages that were selected out.\nAnd all manner of sign processes, not just those associated directly with\nbiological life, come to mean by virtue of an absence: iconicity is the\nproduct of what is not noticed; indexicality involves a prediction of what is\nnot yet present; and symbolic reference, through a convoluted process that\nalso involves iconicity and indexicality, points to and images absent worlds\nby virtue of the ways in which it is embedded in a symbolic system that\nconstitutes the absent context for the meaning of any given word’s utterance.\nIn the “world of mind,” constitutive absence is a particular mediated way in\nwhich an absent future comes to affect the present. This is why it is\nappropriate to consider telos—that future for the sake of which something in\nthe present exists—as a real causal modality wherever there is life (see\nDeacon 2012).\n\nThe constant play between presence and these different kinds of absences gives\nsigns their life. It makes them more than the effect of that which came before\nthem. It makes them images and intimations of something potentially possible.\n\nPROVINCIALIZING LANGUAGE\n\nConsidering crashing palms, jumping monkeys, and “words” like tsupu helps us\nsee that representation is something both more general and more widely\ndistributed than human language. It also helps us see that these other modes\nof representation have properties that are quite different from those\nexhibited by the symbolic modalities on which language depends. In short,\nconsidering those kinds of signs that emerge and circulate beyond the symbolic\nhelps us see that we need to “provincialize” language.\n\nMy call to provincialize language alludes to Dipesh Chakrabarty’s\nProvincializing Europe (2000), his critical account of how South Asian and\nSouth Asianist scholars rely on Western social theory to analyze South Asian\nsocial realities. To provincialize Europe is to recognize that such theory\n(with its assumptions about progress, time, etc.) is situated in the\nparticular European context of its production. Social theorists of South Asia,\nChakrabarty argues, turn a blind eye to this situated context and apply such\ntheory as if it were universal. Chakrabarty asks us to consider what kind of\ntheory might emerge from South Asia, or from other regions for that matter,\nonce we circumscribe the European theory we once took as universal.\n\nIn showing that the production of a particular body of social theory is\nsituated in a particular context and that there are other contexts for which\nthis theory does not apply, Chakrabarty is making an implicit argument about\nthe symbolic properties of the realities such theory seeks to understand.\nContext is an effect of the symbolic. That is, without the symbolic we would\nnot have linguistic, social, cultural, or historical contexts as we understand\nthem. And yet this kind of context does not fully create or circumscribe our\nrealities because we also live in a world that exceeds the symbolic, and this\nis something our social theory must also find ways to address.\n\nChakrabarty’s argument, then, is ultimately couched within humanist\nassumptions about social reality and the theory one might develop to attend to\nit, and so, if taken literally, its application to an anthropology beyond the\nhuman is limited. Nonetheless, I find provincialization useful metaphorically\nas a reminder that symbolic domains, properties, and analytics are always\ncircumscribed by and nested within a broader semiotic field.\n\nWe need to provincialize language because we conflate representation with\nlanguage and this conflation finds its way into our theory. We universalize\nthis distinctive human propensity by first assuming that all representation is\nsomething human and then by supposing that all representation has languagelike\nproperties. That which ought to be delimited as something unique becomes\ninstead the bedrock for our assumptions about representation.\n\nWe anthropologists tend to view representation as a strictly human affair. And\nwe tend to focus only on symbolic representation—that uniquely human semiotic\nmodality.[16](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn16) Symbolic representation, manifested most\nclearly in language, is conventional, “arbitrary,” and embedded in a system of\nother such symbols, which, in turn, is sustained in social, cultural, and\npolitical contexts that have similar systemic and conventional properties. As\nI mentioned earlier, the representational system associated with Saussure,\nwhich is the implicit one that underlies so much of contemporary social\ntheory, concerns itself only with this kind of arbitrary, conventional sign.\n\nThere is another reason why we need to provincialize language: we conflate\nlanguage with representation even when we don’t explicitly draw on language or\nthe symbolic for our theoretical tools. This conflation is most evident in our\nassumptions about ethnographic context. Just as we know that words only\nacquire meanings in terms of the greater context of other such words to which\nthey systemically relate, it is an anthropological axiom that social facts\ncan’t be understood except by virtue of their place in a context made up of\nother such facts. And the same applies for the webs of cultural meanings or\nfor the network of contingent discursive truths as revealed by a Foucauldian\ngenealogy.\n\nContext understood in this way, however, is a property of human conventional\nsymbolic reference, which creates the linguistic cultural and social realities\nthat make us distinctively human. It doesn’t fully apply in domains such as\nhuman-animal relations that are not completely circumscribed by the symbolic\nbut are nevertheless semiotic. The kinds of representational modalities shared\nby all forms of life—modalities that are iconic and indexical—are not context-\ndependent the way symbolic modalities are. That is, such representational\nmodalities do not function by means of a contingent system of sign relations—a\ncontext—the way symbolic modalities do. So in certain semiotic domains context\ndoesn’t apply, and even in those domains such as human ones where it does,\nsuch contexts, as we can see by attending to that which lies beyond the human,\nare, as I will show, permeable. In short, complex wholes are also open\nwholes—hence this chapter’s title. And open wholes reach beyond the\nhuman—hence this anthropology beyond the human.\n\nThis conflation of representation with language—the assumption that all\nrepresentational phenomena have symbolic properties—holds even for those kinds\nof projects that are explicitly critical of cultural, symbolic, or linguistic\napproaches. It is apparent in classical materialist critiques of the symbolic\nand the cultural. It is also apparent in more contemporary phenomenological\napproaches that turn to the bodily experiences we also share with nonhuman\nbeings as a way to avoid anthropocentric mind talk (see Ingold 2000; Csordas\n1999; Stoller 1997). It is also, I should note, apparent in Eduardo Viveiros\nde Castro’s multinaturalism (discussed in detail in chapter 2). When Viveiros\nde Castro writes that “a perspective is not a representation because\nrepresentations are a property of the mind or spirit, whereas the point of\nview is located in the body” (1998: 478), he is assuming that attention to\nbodies (and their natures) can allow us to side step the thorny issues raised\nby representation.\n\nThe alignment between humans, culture, the mind, and representation, on the\none hand, and nonhumans, nature, bodies, and matter, on the other, remains\nstable even in posthuman approaches that seek to dissolve the boundaries that\nhave been erected to construe humans as separate from the rest of the world.\nThis is true of Deleuzian approaches, as exemplified, for example, by Jane\nBennett (2010), that deny the analytical purchase of representation and telos\naltogether—since these are seen, at best, as exclusively human mental affairs.\n\nThis alignment is also evident in attempts in science and technology studies\n(STS), especially those associated with Bruno Latour, to equalize the\nimbalance between unfeeling matter and desiring humans by depriving humans of\na bit of their intentionality and symbolic omnipotence at the same time that\nthey confer on things a bit more agency. In his image of “speech impediments,”\nfor example, Latour attempts to find an idiom that might bridge the analytical\ngap between speaking scientists and their supposedly silent objects of study.\n“Better to have marbles in one’s mouth, when speaking about scientists,” he\nwrites, “then to slip absent-mindedly from mute things to the indisputable\nword of the expert” (2004: 67). Because Latour conflates representation and\nhuman language his only hope to get humans and nonhumans in the same frame is\nto literally mix language and things—to speak with marbles in his mouth. But\nthis solution perpetuates Cartesian dualism because the atomic elements remain\neither human mind or unfeeling matter, despite the fact that these are more\nthoroughly mixed than Descartes would have ever dreamed, and even if one\nclaims that their mixture precedes their realization. This analytic of mixture\ncreates little homunculi at all levels. The hyphen in Latour’s (1993: 106)\n“natures-cultures” is the new pineal gland in the little Cartesian heads that\nthis analytic unwittingly engenders at all scales. An anthropology beyond the\nhuman seeks to find ways to move beyond this analytic of mixture.\n\nErasing the divide between the human mind and the rest of the world, or,\nalternatively, striving for some symmetrical mixing between mind and matter,\nonly encourages this gap to emerge again elsewhere. An important claim I make\nin this chapter, and an important foundation for the arguments to be developed\nin this book, is that the most productive way to overcome this dualism is not\nto do away with representation (and by extension telos, intentionality,\n“aboutness,” and selfhood), or simply project human kinds of representation\nelsewhere, but to radically rethink what it is that we take representation to\nbe. To do this, we need first to provincialize language. We need, in Viveiros\nde Castro’s words, to “decolonize thought,” in order to see that thinking is\nnot necessarily circumscribed by language, the symbolic, or the human.\n\nThis involves reconsidering who in this world represents, as well as what it\nis that counts as representation. It also involves understanding how different\nkinds of representation work and how these different kinds of representation\nvariously interact with each other. What sort of life does semiosis take\nbeyond the trappings of internal human minds, beyond specifically human\npropensities, such as the ability to use language, and beyond those\nspecifically human concerns that those propensities engender? An anthropology\nbeyond the human encourages us to explore what signs look like beyond the\nhuman.\n\nIs such an exploration possible? Or do the all-too-human contexts in which we\nlive bar us from such an endeavor? Are we forever trapped inside our\nlinguistically and culturally mediated ways of thinking? My answer is no: a\nmore complete understanding of representation, which can account for the ways\nin which that exceptionally human kind of semiosis grows out of and is\nconstantly in interplay with other kinds of more widely distributed\nrepresentational modalities, can show us a more productive and analytically\nrobust way out of this persistent dualism.\n\nWe humans are not the only ones who do things for the sake of a future by re-\npresenting it in the present. All living selves do this in some way or\nanother. Representation, purpose, and future are in the world—and not just in\nthat part of the world that we delimit as human mind. This is why it is\nappropriate to say that there is agency in the living world that extends\nbeyond the human. And yet reducing agency to cause and effect—to “affect”—side\nsteps the fact that it is human and nonhuman ways of “thinking” that confer\nagency. Reducing agency to some sort of generic propensity shared by humans\nand nonhumans (which in such approaches includes objects) thanks to the fact\nthat these entities can all equally be represented (or that they can confound\nthese representations), and that they then participate by virtue of this in\nsome sort of very humanlike narrative, trivializes this thinking by failing to\ndistinguish among ways of thinking and by indiscriminately applying\ndistinctively human ways of thinking (based on symbolic representation) to any\nentity.\n\nThe challenge is to defamiliarize the arbitrary sign whose peculiar properties\nare so natural to us because they seem to pervade everything that is in any\nway human and anything else about which humans can hope to know. That you can\nfeel tsupu without knowing Quichua makes language appear strange. It reveals\nthat not all the signs with which we traffic are symbols and that those\nnonsymbolic signs can in important ways break out of bounded symbolic contexts\nlike language. This explains not only why we can come to feel tsupu without\nspeaking Quichua but also why Hilario can communicate with a nonsymbolic\nbeing. Indeed, the startled monkey’s jump, and the entire ecosystem that\nsustains her, constitutes a web of semiosis of which the distinctive semiosis\nof her human hunters is just one particular kind of thread.\n\nTo summarize: signs are not exclusively human affairs. All living beings sign.\nWe humans are therefore at home with the multitude of semiotic life. Our\nexceptional status is not the walled compound we thought we once inhabited. An\nanthropology that focuses on the relations we humans have with nonhuman beings\nforces us to step beyond the human. In the process it makes what we’ve taken\nto be the human condition—namely, the paradoxical, and “provincialized,” fact\nthat our nature is to live immersed in the “unnatural” worlds we\nconstruct—appear a little strange. Learning how to appreciate this is an\nimportant goal of an anthropology beyond the human.\n\nTHE FEELING OF RADICAL SEPARATION\n\nThe Amazon’s many layers of life amplify and make apparent these greater than\nhuman webs of semiosis. Allowing its forests to think their ways through us\ncan help us appreciate how we too are always, in some way or another, embedded\nin such webs and how we might do conceptual work with this fact. This is what\ndraws me to this place. But I’ve also learned something from attending to\nthose times when I’ve felt cut off from these broader semiotic webs that\nextend beyond the symbolic. Here I reflect on such an experience that I had on\none of the many bus trips I made from Quito to the Amazon region. I relay the\nfeeling of what happened on this trip, not as a personal indulgence, but\nbecause I think it reveals a specific quality of symbolic modes of\nthinking—the propensity that symbolic thought has to jump out of the broader\nsemiotic field from which it emerges, separating us, in the process, from the\nworld around us. As such, this experience can also teach us something about\nhow to understand the relation that symbolic thought has to the other kinds of\nthought in the world with which it is continuous and from which it emerges. In\nthis sense, this reflection on my experience is also part of a broader\ncritique, developed in the following two sections, of the dualistic\nassumptions at the base of so many of our analytical frameworks. I explore\nthis experience of becoming dual, of feeling ripped out of a broader semiotic\nenvironment, that I had on a trip down to el Oriente, Ecuador’s Amazonian\nregion east of the Andes, by means of a narrative detour. Apart from serving\nas a bit of a respite from the conceptual work done in this chapter, I hope it\nwill give some sense of the way in which Ávila itself is embedded in a\nlandscape with a history. For this trip traces the trajectories of many other\ntrips, and all of these catch this place up in so many kinds of webs.\n\nThe past few days had been unusually rainy on the eastern slopes of the Andes,\nand the main road leading down to the lowlands had been intermittently washed\nout. Joined by my cousin Vanessa, who was in Ecuador visiting relatives, I\nboarded a bus headed for the Oriente. With the exception of a group of Spanish\ntourists occupying the back rows, the bus was filled with locals who lived\nalong the route or in Tena, the capital of Napo Province and the bus’s final\ndestination. This was a trip I had made many times by now, and it was our plan\nto take this bus along its route over the high cordillera east of Quito that\ndivides the Amazonian watershed from the inter-Andean valley and then to\nfollow this down through the village of Papallacta, the site of a pre-Hispanic\ncloud forest settlement situated along one of the major trade routes through\nwhich highland and lowland products flowed (I refer you to figure 1 on page\n4). Today Papallacta is an important pumping station for Amazonian resources\nsuch as crude oil, which since the 1970s has transformed the country’s economy\nand opened up the Oriente for development, and, more recently, drinking water\nfor Quito tapped from the vast watershed east of the Andes. Nestled in a\nmountain chain that still experiences frequent geological activity, it is also\nthe site of some very popular hot springs. Papallacta is, like many of the\nother cloud forest towns we would pass on our route, now mainly inhabited by\nhighland settlers. The road is carved out of the precipitous gorges of the\nQuijos River valley, which it follows through what was the stronghold of the\npre-Hispanic and early colonial alliance of Quijos chiefdoms. The ancestors of\nthe Ávila Runa formed part of this alliance. Farmers regularly expose\nthousand-year-old residential terraces as they clear the steep forested slopes\nto create pastures. The route continues along the trajectory of the foot\ntrails that until the 1960s connected Ávila and other lowland Runa villages\nlike it, by means of an arduous eight-day journey, to Quito. We would take\nthis road through the town of Baeza, which, along with Ávila and Archidona,\nwas the first Spanish settlement founded in the Upper Amazon. Baeza was almost\nsacked in the same regionally coordinated 1578 indigenous uprising—sparked by\nthe shamanic vision of a cow-god—that completely destroyed Ávila and left\nvirtually all its Spanish inhabitants dead. Today’s Baeza bears little\nresemblance to that historical town—having been relocated a few kilometers\naway following a large earthquake in 1987. Just before Baeza there is a fork\nin the road. One branch heads northeast toward the town of Lago Agrio. This\nwas the first major center of oil extraction in Ecuador, and its name is a\nliteral translation of Sour Lake, the site where oil was first discovered in\nTexas (and the birthplace of Texaco). The other branch, the one we would take,\nfollows an older route to the town of Tena. In the 1950s Tena represented the\nboundary between civilization and the “savage” heathens (the Huaorani) to the\neast. Now it is a quaint town. After winding through steep and unstable\nterrain we would cross the Cosanga River where 150 years ago the Italian\nexplorer Gaetano Osculati was abandoned by his Runa porters and forced to\nspend several miserable nights alone fending off jaguars (Osculati 1990).\nAfter this crossing there would be a final climb through the Huacamayos\nCordillera, which is the last range to be traversed before dropping down to\nthe warm valleys that lead to Archidona and Tena. On a clear day one can catch\nfrom here the shimmering reflections off the metal roofs in Archidona down\nbelow, as well as the road that goes from Tena to Puerto Napo, where it cuts a\nswath of red earth in the steep grade of a hill. Puerto Napo is the long\nabandoned “port” on the Napo River (indicated by a little anchor in figure 1),\nwhich flows into the Amazon. It had the misfortune of being situated just\nupstream from a dangerous whirlpool. If there are no clouds one can also see\nthe sugar cone peak of the Sumaco Volcano on whose foothills Ávila sits. An\narea of close to 200,000 hectares making up the peak and many of its slopes is\nprotected as a biosphere reserve. This reserve, in turn, is surrounded by a\nmuch larger area, which is designated as national forest. Ávila territory\nforms a border with this vast expanse on its western boundary.\n\nOnce out of the mountains the air becomes warmer and heavier as we pass little\nhamlets settled by lowland Runa. Finally, at another fork an hour before\narriving at Tena, we would hop off to wait for a second bus that works its way\nalong this decidedly more local and personal route. On this tertiary road a\nbus driver might stop to broker a deal on a few boxes of the tart naranjilla\nfruits used to make breakfast juice throughout\nEcuador.[17](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn17) Or he might be persuaded to wait a few\nminutes for a regular passenger. This is a relatively new road, having been\ncompleted in the aftermath of the 1987 earthquake with the not entirely\ndisinterested help of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It winds through the\nfoothills that circle Sumaco Volcano before heading out across the Amazonian\nplain at Loreto. It ends at the town of Coca at the confluence of the Coca and\nNapo Rivers. Coca, like Tena, but several decades later, also served as a\nfrontier outpost of the Ecuadorian state as its control expanded deeper into\nthis region. This road cuts through what used to be the hunting territories of\nthe Runa villages of Cotapino, Loreto, Ávila, and San José, which, along with\na handful of “white”-owned estates, or haciendas, and a Catholic mission in\nLoreto, were the only settlements in this area before the 1980s. Today large\nportions of these hunting territories are occupied by outsiders—either fellow\nRuna from the more densely populated Archidona region (whom people in Ávila\nrefer to as boulu, from pueblo, referring to the fact that they are more city-\nwise) or small-time farmers and merchants of coastal or highland origin who\nare often referred to as colonos (or jahua llacta, in Quichua; lit.,\n“highlanders”).\n\nRight after crossing the immense steel panel bridge that traverses the Suno\nRiver, one of several such structures along this route donated by the U.S.\nArmy, we would get off at Loreto, the parish seat and biggest town on the\nroad. We would spend the night here at the Josephine mission run by Italian\npriests. The following day we would retrace our steps, either by foot or by\npickup truck, back over the bridge and then along a dirt road that follows the\nSuno River through colonist farms and pastures until we hit the trail leading\nto Ávila. Roads in eastern Ecuador extend in fits and starts over many years.\nTheir growth spurts usually coincide with local election campaigns. When I\nfirst started visiting Ávila in 1992 there were only foot trails from Loreto,\nand it would take me the better part of a day to get to Hilario’s house. On my\nmost recent visit one could, on a dry day, get to the easternmost portion of\nÁvila territory by pickup truck.\n\nThis was the route we had hoped to traverse. In fact, we didn’t make it to\nLoreto that day. Not too far after Papallacta we encountered the first of a\nseries of landslides set off by the heavy rains. And while our bus, along with\na growing string of trucks, tankers, buses, and cars, waited for this to be\ncleared we became trapped by another landslide behind us.\n\nThis is steep, unstable, and dangerous terrain. The landslides reawakened in\nme a jumble of disturbing images from a decade of traveling this road: a snake\nfrantically tracing figure eights in an immense mudflow that had washed over\nthe road moments before we had gotten there; a steel bridge buckled in half\nlike a crushed soda can by a slurry of rocks let loose as the mountain above\nit came down; a cliff splattered with yellow paint, the only sign left of the\ndelivery truck that had careened into the ravine the night before. But\nlandslides mostly cause delays. Those that can’t quickly be cleared become\nsites for “trasbordos,” an arrangement whereby oncoming buses that can no\nlonger reach their destinations exchange passengers before turning back.\n\nOn this day a trasbordo was out of the question. Traffic was backed up in both\ndirections, and we were trapped by a series of landslides scattered over a\ndistance of several kilometers. The mountain above was starting to fall on us.\nAt one point a rock crashed down onto our roof. I was scared.\n\nNo one else, however, seemed to think we were in danger. Perhaps out of sheer\nnerve, fatalism, or the need, above anything else, to complete the trip,\nneither the driver nor his assistant ever lost his cool. To a certain extent I\ncould understand this. It was the tourists that baffled me. These middle-aged\nSpanish women had booked one of the tours that visit the rain forests and\nindigenous villages along the Napo River. As I worried, these women were\njoking and laughing. At one point one even got off the bus and walked ahead a\nfew cars to a supply truck off of which she bought ham and bread and proceeded\nto make sandwiches for her group.\n\nThe incongruity between the tourists’ nonchalance and my sense of danger\nprovoked in me a strange feeling. As my constant what-ifs became increasingly\ndistant from the carefree chattering tourists, what at first began as a\ndiffuse sense of unease soon morphed into a sense of profound alienation.\n\nThis discrepancy between my perception of the world and that of those around\nme sundered me from the world and those living in it. All I was left with were\nmy own thoughts of future dangers spinning themselves out of control. And then\nsomething more disturbing happened. Because I sensed that my thoughts were out\nof joint with those around me, I soon began to doubt their connection to what\nI had always trusted to be there for me: my own living body, the body that\nwould otherwise give a home to my thoughts and locate this home in a world\nwhose palpable reality I shared with others. I came, in other words, to feel a\ntenuous sense of existence without location—a sense of deracination that put\ninto question my very being. For if the risks I was so sure of didn’t\nexist—after all, no one else on that bus seemed frightened that the mountain\nwould fall on us—then why should I trust my bodily connection to that world?\nWhy should I trust “my” connection to “my” body? And if I didn’t have a body\nwhat was “I”? Was I even alive? Thinking like this, my thoughts ran wild.\n\nThis feeling of radical doubt, the feeling of being cut off from my body and a\nworld whose existence I no longer trusted, didn’t go away when several hours\nlater the landslides were cleared and we were able to get through. Nor did it\nsubside when we finally got to Tena (it was too late to make it to Loreto that\nnight). Not even in the relative comfort of my old haunt the hotel El Dorado\ndid I manage to feel much better. This simple but cozy family-run inn used to\nbe my stopping point when I was doing research in Runa communities on the Napo\nRiver.[18](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn18) It was owned by don Salazar, a veteran—with\nthe scar to prove it—of Ecuador’s short war with Peru in which Ecuador lost a\nthird of its territory and access to the Amazon River. The hotel’s name, El\nDorado, appropriately marks this loss by paying homage to that never quite\nattainable City of Gold that lies somewhere deep in the Amazon (see Slater\n2002; see also chapters 5 and 6).\n\nThe next morning after a fitful night I was still out of sorts. I couldn’t\nstop imagining different dangerous scenarios, and I still felt cut off from my\nbody and from those around me. Of course I pretended I wasn’t feeling any of\nthis. Trying at least to act normal, and in the process compounding my private\nanxiety by failing to give it a social existence, I took my cousin for a short\nwalk along the banks of the Misahuallí River, which cuts the town of Tena in\nhalf. Within a few minutes I spotted a tanager feeding in the shrubs at the\nscruffy edges of town where molding cinder blocks meet polished river cobbles.\nI had brought along my binoculars and managed, after some searching, to locate\nthe bird. I rolled the focusing knob and the moment that bird’s thick black\nbeak became sharp I experienced a sudden shift. My sense of separation simply\ndissolved. And, like the tanager coming into focus, I snapped back into the\nworld of life.\n\nThere is a name for what I felt on that trip to the Oriente: anxiety. After\nreading Constructing Panic (1995), a remarkable account, written by the late\npsychologist Lisa Capps and the linguistic anthropologist Elinor Ochs, of one\nwoman’s lifelong struggles with anxiety, I’ve come to an understanding of this\ncondition as revealing something important about the specific qualities of\nsymbolic thought. Here is how Meg, the woman they write about, experiences the\nsuffocating weight of all of the future possibles opened up by the symbolic\nimagination.\n\n> Sometimes I get to the end of the day and feel exhausted by all of the “what\n> if that had happened” and “what if this happens.” And then I realize that\n> I’ve been sitting on the sofa—that it’s just me and my own thoughts driving\n> me crazy. (Capps and Ochs 1995: 25)\n\nCapps and Ochs describe Meg as “desperate” to “experience the reality that she\nattributes to normal people” (25). Meg feels “severed from an awareness of\nherself and her environment as familiar and knowable” (31). She senses that\nher experience does not fit with what, according to others, “happened” (24),\nand she thus has no one with whom to share a common image of the world, or a\nset of assumptions about how it works. Furthermore, she can’t seem to ground\nherself in any specific place. Meg often uses the construction, “here I am,”\nto express her existential predicament, but a crucial element is missing: “she\nis telling her interlocutors that she exists, but not where in particular she\nis located” (64).\n\nThe title Constructing Panic is intended by the authors to refer to how Meg\ndiscursively constructs her experience of panic—their assumption being that\n“the stories people tell construct who they are and how they view the world”\n(8). But I think the title reveals something deeper about panic. It is\nprecisely the constructive quality of symbolic thought, the fact that symbolic\nthought can create so many virtual worlds, that makes anxiety possible. It is\nnot just that Meg constructs her experience of panic linguistically, socially,\nculturally, in other words, symbolically, rather that panic itself is a\nsymptom of symbolic construction run wild.\n\nReading Capps and Ochs’s discussion of Meg’s experience of panic, and thinking\nabout it semiotically, I think I have come to an understanding of what\nhappened on that trip to the Oriente, the factors that produced panic in me,\nand those that led to its dissipation. As with Meg, who locates her first\nexperiences of anxiety in situations in which her legitimate fears were not\nsocially recognized (31), my anxiety emerged as I was confronted with the\ndisconnect between my well-founded fear and the carefree attitudes of the\ntourists on the bus.\n\nSymbolic thought run wild can create minds radically separate from the\nindexical grounding their bodies might otherwise provide. Our bodies, like all\nof life, are the products of semiosis. Our sensory experiences, even our most\nbasic cellular and metabolic processes, are mediated by\nrepresentational—though not necessarily symbolic—relations (see chapter 2).\nBut symbolic thought run wild can make us experience “ourselves” as set apart\nfrom everything: our social contexts, the environments in which we live, and\nultimately even our desires and dreams. We become displaced to such an extent\nthat we come to question the indexical ties that would otherwise ground this\nspecial kind of symbolic thinking in “our” bodies, bodies that are themselves\nindexically grounded in the worlds beyond them: I think therefore I doubt that\nI am.\n\nHow is this possible? And why is it that we don’t all live in a constant state\nof skeptical panic? That my sense of anxious alienation dissipated the moment\nthe bird came into sharp focus provides some insights into the conditions\nunder which symbolic thought can become so radically separate from the world,\nas well as those under which it can fall back into place. I do not, by any\nmeans, wish to romanticize tropical nature or privilege anyone’s connection to\nit. This sort of regrounding can happen anywhere. Nonetheless, sighting that\ntanager in the bush at the messy edge of town taught me something about how\nimmersion in this particularly dense ecology amplifies and makes visible a\nlarger semiotic field beyond that which is exceptionally human, one in which\nwe are all—usually—emplaced. Seeing that tanager made me sane by allowing me\nto situate the feeling of radical separation within something broader. It\nresituated me in a larger world “beyond” the human. My mind could return to\nbeing part of a larger mind. My thoughts about the world could once again\nbecome part of the thoughts of the world. An anthropology beyond the human\nstrives to grasp the importance of these sorts of connections while\nappreciating why we humans are so apt to lose sight of them.\n\nNOVELTY OUT OF CONTINUITY\n\nThinking about panic in this way has led me to question more broadly how best\nto theorize the separation that symbolic thought creates. We tend to assume\nthat because something like the symbolic is exceptionally human and thus novel\n(at least as far as earthly life is concerned) it must also be radically\nseparate from that from which it comes. This is the Durkheimian legacy we\ninherit: social facts have their own kind of novel reality, which can only be\nunderstood in terms of other such social facts and not in terms of anything—be\nit psychological, biological, or physical—prior to them (see Durkheim 1972:\n69–73). But the sense of radical separation that I experienced is psychically\nuntenable—even life negating in some sense. And this leads me to suspect that\nthere is something the matter with any analytical approach that would take\nsuch a separation as its starting point.\n\nIf, as I claim, our distinctively human thoughts stand in continuity with the\nforest’s thoughts insofar as both are in some way or other the products of the\nsemiosis that is intrinsic to life (see chapter 2), then an anthropology\nbeyond the human must find a way to account for the distinctive qualities of\nhuman thought without losing sight of its relation to these more pervasive\nsemiotic logics. Accounting conceptually for the relation this novel dynamic\nhas to that from which it comes can help us better understand the relationship\nbetween what we take to be distinctively human and that which lies beyond us.\nIn this regard I want to think here about what panic, and especially its\nresolution, has taught me. To do so I draw on a series of Amazonian examples\nto trace the ways in which iconic, indexical, and symbolic processes are\nnested within each other. Symbols depend on indices for their being and\nindices depend on icons. This allows us to appreciate what makes each of these\nunique without losing sight of how they also stand in a relation of continuity\nwith each other.\n\nFollowing Deacon (1997), I begin with a counterintuitive example at the very\nmargins of semiosis. Consider the cryptically camouflaged Amazonian insect\nknown as the walking stick in English because its elongated torso looks so\nmuch like a twig. Its Quichua name is shanga. Entomologists call it,\nappropriately, a phasmid—as in phantom—placing it in the order Phasmida and\nthe family Phasmidae. This name is fitting. What makes these creatures so\ndistinctive is their lack of distinction: they disappear like a phantom into\nthe background. How did they come to be so phantasmic? The evolution of such\ncreatures reveals important things about some of the “phantomlike” logical\nproperties of semiosis that can, in turn, help us understand some of the\ncounterintuitive properties of life “itself”—properties that are amplified in\nthe Amazon and Runa ways of living there. For this reason, I will return to\nthis example throughout the book. Here I want to focus on it with an eye to\nunderstanding how the different semiotic modalities—the iconic, the indexical,\nthe symbolic—have their own unique properties at the same time that they stand\nin a relation of nested continuity to each other.\n\nHow did walking sticks come to be so invisible, so phantomlike? That such a\nphasmid looks like a twig does not depend on anyone noticing this\nresemblance—our usual understanding of how likeness works. Rather, its\nlikeness is the product of the fact that the ancestors of its potential\npredators did not notice its ancestors. These potential predators failed to\nnotice the differences between these ancestors and actual twigs. Over\nevolutionary time those lineages of walking sticks that were least noticed\nsurvived. Thanks to all the proto–walking sticks that were noticed—and\neaten—because they differed from their environments walking sticks came to be\nmore like the world of twigs around them.[19](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn19)\n\nHow walking sticks came to be so invisible reveals important properties of\niconicity. Iconicity, the most basic kind of sign process, is highly\ncounterintuitive because it involves a process by which two things are not\ndistinguished. We tend to think of icons as signs that point to the\nsimilarities among things we know to be different. We know, for example, that\nthe iconic stick figure of the man on the bathroom door resembles but is not\nthe same as the person who might walk through that door. But there is\nsomething deeper about iconicity that is missed when we focus on this sort of\nexample. Semiosis does not begin with the recognition of any intrinsic\nsimilarity or difference. Rather, it begins with not noticing difference. It\nbegins with indistinction. For this reason iconicity occupies a space at the\nvery margins of semiosis (for there is nothing semiotic about never noticing\nanything at all). It marks the beginning and end of thought. With icons new\ninterpretants—subsequent signs that would further specify something about\ntheir objects—are no longer produced (Deacon 1997: 76, 77); with icons thought\nis at rest. Understanding something, however provisional that understanding\nmay be, involves an icon. It involves a thought that is like its object. It\ninvolves an image that is a likeness of that object. For this reason all\nsemiosis ultimately relies on the transformation of more complex signs into\nicons (Peirce CP 2.278).\n\nSigns, of course, provide information. They tell us something new. They tell\nus about a difference. That is their reason for being. Semiosis must then\ninvolve something other than likeness. It must also involve a semiotic logic\nthat points to something else—a logic that is indexical. How do the semiotic\nlogics of likeness and difference relate to each other? Again, following\nDeacon (1997), consider the following schematic explanation of how that woolly\nmonkey that Hilario and Lucio were trying to frighten out of her hidden canopy\nperch might learn to interpret a crashing palm as a sign of\ndanger.[20](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn20) The thundering crash she heard would\niconically call to mind past experiences of similar crashes. These past\nexperiences of crashing sounds share with each other additional similarities,\nsuch as their co-occurrence with something dangerous—say, a branch breaking or\na predator approaching. The monkey would in addition iconically link these\npast dangers to each other. That the sound made by a crashing tree might\nindicate danger is, then, the product of, on the one hand, iconic associations\nof loud noises with other loud noises, and, on the other, iconic associations\nof dangerous events with other dangerous events. That these two sets of iconic\nassociations are repeatedly linked to each other encourages the current\nexperience of a sudden loud noise to be seen as linked to them. But now this\nassociation is also something more than a likeness. It impels the monkey to\n“guess” that the crash must be linked to something other than itself,\nsomething different. Just as a wind vane, as an index, is interpreted as\npointing to something other than itself, namely, the direction in which the\nwind is blowing, so this loud noise is interpreted as pointing to something\nmore than just a noise; it points to something dangerous.\n\nIndexicality, then, involves something more than iconicity. And yet it emerges\nas a result of a complex hierarchical set of associations among icons. The\nlogical relationship between icons and indices is unidirectional. Indices are\nthe products of a special layered relation among icons but not the other way\naround. Indexical reference, such as that involved in the monkey’s take on the\ncrashing tree, is a higher-order product of a special relationship among three\nicons: crashes bring to mind other crashes; dangers associated with such\ncrashes bring to mind other such associations; and these, in turn, are\nassociated with the current crash. Because of this special configuration of\nicons the current crash now points to something not immediately present: a\ndanger. In this way an index emerges from iconic associations. This special\nrelationship among icons results in a form of reference with unique properties\nthat derive from but are not shared with the iconic associational logics with\nwhich they are continuous. Indices provide information; they tell us something\nnew about something not immediately present.\n\nSymbols, of course, also provide information. How they do so is both\ncontinuous with and different from indices. Just as indices are the product of\nrelations among icons and exhibit unique properties with respect to these more\nfundamental signs, symbols are the product of relations among indices and have\ntheir own unique properties. This relationship also goes only in one\ndirection. Symbols are built from a complex layered interaction among indices,\nbut indices do not require symbols.\n\nA word, such as chorongo, one of the Ávila names for woolly monkey, is a\nsymbol par excellence. Although it can serve an indexical function—pointing to\nsomething (or, more appropriately, someone)—it does so indirectly, by virtue\nof its relation to other words. That is, the relation that such a word has to\nan object is primarily the result of the conventional relation it has acquired\nto other words and not just a function of the correlation between sign and\nobject (as with an index). Just as we can think of indexical reference as the\nproduct of a special configuration of iconic relations, we can think of\nsymbolic reference as the product of a special configuration of indexical\nones. What is the relationship of indices to symbols? Imagine learning\nQuichua. A word such as chorongo is relatively easy to learn. One can learn\nthat it refers to what in English is called a woolly monkey quite quickly. As\nsuch, it isn’t really functioning symbolically. The pointing relationship\nbetween this “word” and the monkey is primarily indexical. The commands that\ndogs learn are very much like this. A dog can come to associate a “word” like\nsit with a behavior. As such, “sit” functions indexically. The dog can\nunderstand “sit” without understanding it symbolically. But there is a limit\nto how far we can go toward learning human language by memorizing words and\nwhat they point to; there are just too many individual sign-object\nrelationships to keep track of. Furthermore, rote memorization of sign-object\ncorrelations misses the logic of language. Take a somewhat more complex word\nlike causanguichu, which I discussed earlier in this chapter. Non-Quichua\nspeakers can quickly learn that it is a greeting (uttered only in certain\nsocial contexts), but getting a sense of what and how it means requires us to\nunderstand how it relates to other words and even smaller units of language.\n\nWords like chorongo, sit, or causanguichu do of course refer to things in the\nworld, but in symbolic reference the indexical relation of word to object\nbecomes subordinate to the indexical relation of word to word in a system of\nsuch words. When we learn a foreign language or when infants acquire language\nfor the first time there is a shift away from using linguistic signs as\nindices to appreciating them in their broader symbolic contexts. Deacon (1997)\ndescribes one experimental setting where such a shift is particularly\napparent. He discusses a long-term lab experiment in which chimps, already\nadept in their everyday lives at interpreting signs indexically, were trained\nto replace this interpretive strategy with a symbolic\none.[21](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn21)\n\nFirst, the chimps in the experiment had to interpret certain sign vehicles (in\nthis case keyboard keys with certain shapes on them) as indices of certain\nobjects or acts (such as particular food items or actions). Next, such sign\nvehicles had to be seen as indexically connected to each other in a systematic\nway. The final, and most difficult and most important, step involved an\ninterpretive shift whereby objects were no longer picked out in a direct\nfashion by the individual indexical signs but instead came to be picked out\nindirectly, by virtue of the ways in which the signs representing them related\nto each other and the ways in which these sign relations then mapped onto how\nthe objects themselves were to be thought to relate to each other. The mapping\nbetween these two levels of indexical associations (those linking objects to\nobjects and those linking signs to signs) is iconic (Deacon 1997: 79–92). It\ninvolves not noticing the individual indexical associations by which signs can\npick out objects in order to see a more encompassing likeness between the\nrelations that link a system of signs and those that link a set of objects.\n\nI am now in a position to account for the sense of separation—which I\nexperienced as panic on the bus ride I described earlier—that the symbolic\ncreates. I can now do so with regard to the more basic forms of reference to\nwhich it relates and with which it is continuous.\n\nThe symbolic is a prime example of a kind of dynamic that Deacon calls\n“emergent.” For Deacon, an emergent dynamic is one in which particular\nconfigurations of constraints on possibility result in unprecedented\nproperties at a higher level. Crucially, however, something that is emergent\nis never cut off from that from which it came and within which it is nested\nbecause it still depends on these more basic levels for its properties (Deacon\n2006). Before considering symbolic reference as emergent with respect to other\nsemiotic modalities it is useful to think about how emergence works in the\nnonhuman world.\n\nDeacon recognizes a series of nested emergent thresholds. An important one is\nself-organization. Self-organization involves the spontaneous generation,\nmaintenance and propagation of form under the right circumstances. Although\nrelatively ephemeral and rare, self-organization is nonetheless found in the\nnonliving world. Examples of self-organizing emergent dynamics include the\ncircular whirlpools that sometimes form in Amazonian rivers, or the geometric\nlattices of crystals or snowflakes. Self-organizing dynamics are more regular\nand more constrained than the physical entropic dynamics—such as those\ninvolved, for example, in the spontaneous flow of heat from a warmer to a\ncolder part of a room—from which they emerge and on which they depend.\nEntities that exhibit self-organization, such as crystals, snowflakes, or\nwhirlpools, are not alive. Nor, despite their name, do they involve a self.\n\nLife, by contrast, is a subsequent emergent threshold nested within self-\norganization. Living dynamics, as represented by even the most basic\norganisms, selectively “remember” their own specific self-organizing\nconfigurations, which are differentially retained in the maintenance of what\ncan now be understood as a self—a form that is reconstituted and propagated\nover the generations in ways that exhibit increasingly better fits to the\nworlds around it. Living dynamics, as I explore in greater detail in the\nfollowing chapter, are constitutively semiotic. The semiosis of life is iconic\nand indexical. Symbolic reference, that which makes humans unique, is an\nemergent dynamic that is nested within this broader semiosis of life from\nwhich it stems and on which it depends.\n\nSelf-organizing dynamics are distinct from the physical processes from which\nthey emerge and with which they are continuous, and within which they are\nnested. Living dynamics have a similar relation to the self-organizing\ndynamics from which they, in turn, emerge, and the same can be said for the\nrelation that symbolic semiosis has to the broader iconic and indexical\nsemiotic processes of life from which it emerges (Deacon 1997:\n73).[22](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn22) Emergent dynamics, then, are directional both in\na logical and in an ontological sense. That is, a world characterized by self-\norganization need not include life, and a living world need not include\nsymbolic semiosis. But a living world must also be a self-organizing one, and\na symbolic world must be nested within the semiosis of life.\n\nI can now return to the emergent properties of symbolic representation. This\nform of representation is emergent with respect to iconic and indexical\nreference in the sense that, as with other emergent dynamics, the systemic\nstructure of relationships among symbols is not prefigured in the antecedent\nmodes of reference (Deacon 1997: 99). Like other emergent dynamics symbols\nhave unique properties. The fact that symbols achieve their referential power\nby virtue of the systemic relations they have to each other means that, as\nopposed to indices, they can retain referential stability even in the absence\nof their objects of reference. This is what confers on symbols their unique\ncharacteristics. It is what allows symbolic reference to be not only about the\nhere and now, but about the “what if.” In the realm of the symbolic, the\nseparation from materiality and energy can be so great and the causal links so\nconvoluted that reference acquires a veritable freedom. And this is what has\nled to treating it as if it were radically separate from the world (see also\nPeirce CP 6.101).\n\nYet, like other emergent dynamics, such as the vortex of a whirlpool formed in\na river’s current, symbolic reference is also closely tied to the more basic\ndynamics out of which it grows. This is true in the way that symbols are\nconstructed as well as in the way in which they are interpreted. Symbols are\nthe outcome of a special relationship among indices, which in turn are\noutcomes of a special relationship that links icons in a particular way. And\nsymbolic interpretation works via pairings of sets of indexical relations,\nwhich are ultimately interpreted by recognizing the iconicity between them:\nall thought ends with an icon. Symbolic reference, then, is ultimately the\nproduct of a series of highly convoluted systemic relations among icons. And\nyet it has properties that are unique when compared to iconic and indexical\nmodalities. Symbolic reference does not exclude these other kinds of sign\nrelations. Symbolic systems such as language can, and regularly do,\nincorporate relatively iconic signs, as in the case of “words” like tsupu, and\nthey are also completely dependent on iconicity at a variety of levels as well\nas on all sorts of pointing relationships among signs and between systems of\nsigns and the things they represent. Symbolic reference, finally, like all\nsemiosis, is also ultimately dependent on the more fundamental material,\nenergetic, and self-organizing processes from which it emerges.\n\nThinking of symbolic reference as emergent can help us understand how, via\nsymbols, reference can become increasingly separated from the world but\nwithout ever fully losing the potential to be susceptible to the patterns,\nhabits, forms, and events of the world.\n\nSeeing symbolic reference and by extension human language and culture as\nemergent follows in the spirit of Peirce’s critique of dualistic attempts to\nseparate (human) mind from (nonhuman) matter—an approach that he acerbically\ncharacterized as “the philosophy which performs its analyses with an axe,\nleaving as the ultimate elements, unrelated chunks of being” (CP 7.570). An\nemergentist approach can provide a theoretical and empirical account of how\nthe symbolic is in continuity with matter at the same time that it can come to\nbe a novel causal locus of possibility. This continuity allows us to recognize\nhow something so unique and separate is also never fully cut off from the rest\nof the world. This gets at something important about how an anthropology\nbeyond the human seeks to situate that which is distinctive to humans in the\nbroader world from which it emerges.\n\nPanic and its dissipation reveal these properties of symbolic semiosis. They\npoint both to the real dangers of unfettered symbolic thought and to how such\nthought can be regrounded. Watching birds regrounded my thoughts, and by\nextension my emerging self, by re-creating the semiotic environment in which\nsymbolic reference is itself nested. Through the artifice of my binoculars I\nbecame indexically aligned with a bird, thanks to the fact that I was able to\nappreciate its image now coming into sharp focus right there in front of me.\nThis event reimmersed me in something that Meg, on her sofa, alone with her\nthoughts, was not so readily able to find: a knowable (and shareable)\nenvironment, and the assurance, for the moment, of some sort of existence,\ntangibly located in a here and now that extended beyond me but of which I too\ncould come to be a part.\n\nPanic provides us with intimations of what radical dualism might feel like,\nand why for us humans dualism seems so compelling. In tracing its untenable\neffects panic also provides its own visceral critique of dualism and the\nskepticism that so often accompanies it. In panic’s dissolution we can also\nget a sense for how a particular human propensity for dualism is dissolved\ninto something else. One might say that dualism, wherever it is found, is a\nway of seeing emergent novelty as if it were severed from that from which it\nemerged.\n\nEMERGENT REALS\n\nBy watching birds on the banks of the river that morning in Tena I certainly\ngot out of my head in the colloquial sense, but what was I stepping into?\nAlthough the more basic semiotic modes of engagement involved in that activity\nquite literally brought me back to my senses and in the process regrounded me\nin a world beyond myself—beyond my mind, beyond convention, beyond the\nhuman—this experience has led me to ask what kind of world is this that lies\nout there beyond the symbolic? In other words, this experience, understood in\nthe context of the anthropology beyond the human that I seek here to develop,\nforces me to rethink what we mean by the “real.”\n\nWe generally think of the real as that which exists. The palm tree that came\ncrashing down in the forest is real; the shorn branches and crushed plants\nleft in the wake of its fall are proof of its awesome facticity. But a\nrestricted characterization of the real as something that happened—out there\nand law-bound—can’t account for spontaneity, or life’s tendency for growth.\nNor can it account for the semiosis shared by the living—a semiosis that\nemerges from and ultimately grounds us humans in the world of life.\nFurthermore, such a characterization would dualistically reinscribe all\npossibility in that separate chunk of being we delimit as the human mind with\nno intimation of how that mind, its semiosis and its creativity, could have\nemerged from or otherwise be related to anything else.\n\nPeirce was quite concerned with this problem of how to imagine a more\ncapacious real that is more true to a naturalistic, nondualist understanding\nof the universe and, throughout his career, strove to situate his entire\nphilosophical project—including his semiotics—within a special kind of realism\nthat could encompass actual existence within a broader framework that would\naccount for its relationship to spontaneity, growth, and the life of signs in\nhuman and nonhuman worlds. I turn here to a brief exposition of his framework\nbecause it provides a vision of the real that can encompass living minds and\nnonliving matter, as well as the many processes through which the former\nemerged from the latter.\n\nAccording to Peirce there are three aspects of the real of which we can become\naware (CP 1.23–26). The element of the real that is easiest for us to\ncomprehend is what Peirce called “secondness.” The crashing palm is a\nquintessential second. Secondness refers to otherness, change, events,\nresistance, and facts. Seconds are “brutal” (CP 1.419). They “shock” (CP\n1.336) us out of our habitual ways of imagining how things are. They force us\nto “think otherwise than we have been thinking” (CP 1.336).\n\nPeirce’s realism also encompasses something he called “firstness.” Firsts are\n“mere may-bes, not necessarily realized.” They involve the special kind of\nreality of a spontaneity, a quality, or a possibility (CP 1.304), in its “own\nsuchness” (CP 1.424), regardless of its relation to anything else. One day out\nin the forest Hilario and I came across a bunch of wild passion fruits that\nhad been knocked down by a troop of monkeys feeding up above. We took a break\nfrom our trek to snack on the monkeys’ leftovers. As I cracked open the fruit,\nI caught, just for an instant, a pungent whiff of cinnamon. By the time I\nbrought the fruit to my mouth it was gone. The experience of the fleeting\nsmell, in and of itself, without attention to where it came from, what it is\nlike, or to what it connects, approaches firstness.\n\nThirdness, finally, is that aspect of Peirce’s realism that is the most\nimportant to the argument in this book. Drawing inspiration from the medieval\nScholastics, Peirce insisted that “generals are real.” That is, habits,\nregularities, patterns, relationality, future possibilities, and purposes—what\nhe called thirds—have an eventual efficacy, and they can originate and\nmanifest themselves in worlds outside of human minds (CP 1.409). The world is\ncharacterized by “the tendency of all things to take habits” (CP 6.101): the\ngeneral tendency in the universe toward an increase in entropy is a habit; the\nless common tendency toward increases in regularity, exhibited in self-\norganizing processes such as the formation of circular whirlpools in a river\nor crystal lattice structures, is also a habit; and life, with its ability to\npredict and harness such regularities and, in the process, create an\nincreasing array of novel kinds of regularities, amplifies this tendency\ntoward habit taking. This tendency is what makes the world potentially\npredictable and what makes life as a semiotic process, which is ultimately\ninferential,[23](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn23) possible. For it is only because the\nworld has some semblance of regularity that it can be represented. Signs are\nhabits about habits. Tropical forests with their many layers of coevolved\nlife-forms amplify this tendency toward habit taking to an extreme.\n\nAll processes that involve mediation exhibit thirdness. Accordingly, all sign\nprocesses exhibit thirdness because they serve as a third term that mediates\nbetween “something” and some sort of “someone” in some way. However, it is\nimportant to stress that for Peirce, although all signs are thirds, not all\nthirds are signs.[24](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn24) Generality, the tendency toward\nhabit, is not a feature that is imposed on the world by a semiotic mind. It is\nout there. The thirdness in the world is the condition for semiosis, it is not\nsomething that semiosis “brings” to the world.\n\nFor Peirce everything exhibits, to some degree or other, firstness,\nsecondness, and thirdness (CP 1.286, 6.323). Different kinds of sign processes\namplify certain aspects of each of these to the neglect of others. Although\nall signs are intrinsically triadic, in that they all represent something to a\nsomeone, different kinds of signs attend more toward either firstness,\nsecondness, or thirdness.\n\nIcons, as thirds, are relative firsts in that they mediate by the fact that\nthey possess the same qualities as their objects regardless of their relation\nto anything else. This is why Quichua imagistic “words” like tsupu cannot be\nnegated or inflected. There is a way in which they are just qualities in their\n“own suchness.” Indices, as thirds, are relative seconds because they mediate\nby being affected by their objects. The crashing palm startled the monkey.\nSymbols, as thirds, by contrast, are doubly triadic because they mediate by\nreference to something general—an emerging habit. They mean by virtue of the\nrelationship they have to the conventional and abstract system of symbols—a\nsystem of habits—that will come to interpret them. This is why understanding\ncausanguichu requires a familiarity with Quichua as a whole. The symbolic is a\nhabit about a habit that, to a degree unprecedented elsewhere on this planet,\nbegets other habits.\n\nOur thoughts are like the world because we are of the\nworld.[25](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn25) Thought (of any kind) is a highly convoluted\nhabit that has emerged out of, and is continuous with, the tendency in the\nworld toward habit taking. In this manner Peirce’s special kind of realism can\nallow us to begin to envision an anthropology that can be about the world in\nways that recognize but also go beyond the limits of human-specific ways of\nknowing. Rethinking semiosis is the place from which to begin such an\nendeavor.\n\nIt is through this expanded vision of the real that we can consider what it\nwas that I was getting out of when that bird came into focus through the glass\nof my binoculars, and what it was in that process that I stepped into. As\nCapps and Ochs astutely point out, what is so disturbing about panic is the\nfeeling of being out of sync with others. We come to be alone with thoughts\nthat become increasingly cut off from the broader field of habits that gave\nrise to them. In other words, there is always the danger that symbolic\nthought’s unmatched ability to create habit can pull us out of the habits in\nwhich we are inserted.\n\nBut the living mind is not uprooted in this way. Thoughts that grow and are\nalive are always about something in the world, even if that something is a\npotential future effect. Part of the generality of thought—its thirdness—is\nthat it is not just located in a single stable self. Rather, it is\nconstitutive of an emerging one distributed over multiple bodies:\n\n> Man is not whole as long as he is single[;] . . . he is essentially a\n> possible member of society. Especially, one man’s experience is nothing, if\n> it stands alone. If he sees what others cannot, we call it hallucination. It\n> is not “my” experience, but “our” experience that has to be thought of; and\n> this “us” has indefinite possibilities. (Peirce CP 5.402)\n\nThis “us” is a general.\n\nAnd panic disrupts this general. With panic there is a collapse of the triadic\nrelation linking my habit-making mind to other habit-making minds vis-à-vis\nour ability to share the experience of the habits of the world that we\ndiscover. The solipsistic enfolding of an increasingly private mind onto\nitself results in something terrifying: the implosion of the self. In panic\nthe self becomes a monadic “first” severed from the rest of the world; a\n“possible member of society” whose only capability is to doubt the existence\nof any of what Haraway (2003) calls its more “fleshly” connections to the\nworld. The result, in sum, is a skeptical Cartesian cogito: a fixed “I (only)\nthink (symbolically) therefore I (doubt that I) am” instead of a growing,\nhopeful, and emergent “us” with all its “indefinite\npossibilities.”[26](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn26)\n\nThis triadic alignment that results in an emergent “us” is achieved\nindexically and iconically. Consider Lucio’s running commentary after he shot\nthe woolly monkey that had been scared out of her treetop perch by the palm\ntree that Hilario felled:\n\n> there\n>\n> right there\n>\n> there\n>\n> what’s gonna happen?\n>\n> there, it’s curled up in a ball\n>\n> all wounded[27](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn27)\n\nHilario, whose eyesight is not as good as Lucio’s, wasn’t immediately able to\nsee the monkey up in the tree. Whispering, he asked his son, “Where?” And as\nthe monkey suddenly began to move Lucio rapidly responded, “Look! look! look!\nlook!”\n\nThe imperative “look!” (Quichua “ricui!”) functions here as an index to orient\nHilario’s gaze along the path of the monkey’s movement across the length of\nthe branch. As such it aligns Hilario and Lucio vis-à-vis the monkey in the\ntree. In addition, Lucio’s rhythmic repetition of the imperative iconically\ncaptures the pace of the monkey’s movement along the branch. Through this\nimage that Hilario can also come to share, Lucio can “directly communicate”\nhis experience of seeing the wounded monkey moving through the canopy,\nregardless of whether his father actually managed to see her.\n\nIt is precisely this sort of iconic and indexical alignment that brought me\nback into the world the moment that tanager came into focus in my binoculars.\nThat crisp image of the bird sitting right there in those shrubs grounded me\nagain in a shareable real. This is so even though icons and indices do not\nprovide us with any immediate purchase on the world. All signs involve\nmediation, and all of our experiences are semiotically mediated. There is no\nbodily, inner, or other kind of experience or thought that is unmediated (see\nPeirce CP 8.332). Furthermore, there is nothing intrinsically objective about\nthis real tanager feeding on a real riverbank plant. For this animal and its\nshrubby perch—like me—are semiotic creatures through and through. They are the\nresults of representation. They are outcomes of an evolutionary process of\never-increasing alignment with those proliferating webs of habits that\nconstitute tropical life. Such habits are real, regardless of whether or not I\ncan appreciate them. By acquiring a feel for some of these habits, as I did\nwith that tanager on the river’s edge that morning, I can potentially become\naligned with a broader “us” thanks to the way others can share this experience\nwith me.\n\nLike our thoughts and minds, birds and plants are emergent reals. Life-forms,\nas they represent and amplify the habits of the world, create new habits, and\ntheir interactions with other organisms create even more habits. Life, then,\nproliferates habits. Tropical forests, with their high biomass, unparalleled\nspecies diversity, and intricate coevolutionary interactions, exhibit this\ntendency toward habit taking to an unusual degree. For people like the Ávila\nRuna, who are intimately involved with the forest through hunting and other\nsubsistence activities, being able to predict these habits is of the utmost\nimportance.\n\nSo much of what draws me to the Amazon is the ways in which one kind of third\n(the habits of the world) are represented by another kind of third (the human\nand nonhuman semiotic selves who live in and constitute this world) in such a\nway that more kinds of thirds can “flourish” (see Haraway 2008). Life\nproliferates habits. Tropical life amplifies this to an extreme, and the Runa\nand others who are immersed in this biological world can amplify this even\nfurther.\n\nGROWTH\n\nBeing alive—being in the flow of life—involves aligning ourselves with an\never-increasing array of emerging habits. But being alive is more than being\nin habit. The lively flourishing of that semiotic dynamic whose source and\noutcome is what I call self is also a product of disruption and shock. As\nopposed to inanimate matter, which Peirce characterized as “mind whose habits\nhave become fixed so as to lose the powers of forming them and losing them,”\nmind (or self) “has acquired in a remarkable degree a habit of taking and\nlaying aside habits” (CP 6.101).\n\nThis habit of selectively discarding certain other habits results in the\nemergence of higher-order habits. In other words, growth requires learning\nsomething about the habits around us, and yet this often involves a disruption\nof our habituated expectations of what the world is like. When the pig that\nMaxi shot plunged—tsupu—into the river, as wounded pigs are known to do, Maxi\nassumed that he had gotten his quarry. He was wrong:\n\n> foolishly, “it’s gonna die,” I’m thinking\n>\n> when\n>\n> it suddenly ran off[28](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn28)\n\nMaxi’s feeling of bewilderment occasioned by the supposedly dead peccary\nsuddenly jumping up and running off reveals something of what Haraway (1999:\n184) calls “a sense of the world’s independent sense of humor.” And it is in\nsuch moments of “shock” that the habits of the world make themselves manifest.\nThat is, we don’t usually notice the habits we in-habit. It is only when the\nworld’s habits clash with our expectations that the world in its otherness,\nand its existent actuality as something other than what we currently are, is\nrevealed. The challenge that follows this disruption is to grow. The challenge\nis to create a new habit that will encompass this foreign habit and, in the\nprocess, to remake ourselves, however momentarily, anew, as one with the world\naround us.\n\nLiving in and from the tropical forest requires an ability to make sense of\nthe many layers of its habits. This is sometimes accomplished by recognizing\nthose elements that appear to disrupt them. On another walk in the forest with\nHilario and his son Lucio we came across a small bird of prey, known in\nEnglish as the hook-billed kite,[29](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn29) perched in the\nbranches of a small tree. Lucio shot at it but missed. Frightened, the bird\nflew off in a strange manner. Rather than fly rapidly through the understory,\nas raptors are expected to do, it lumbered off quite slowly. As he pointed in\nthe direction in which it went Lucio remarked:\n\n> it just went off slowly\n>\n> tca tca tca tca\n>\n> there[30](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn30)\n\nTca tca tca tca. Throughout the day Lucio repeated this sonic image of wings\nflapping slowly, hesitantly, and somewhat awkwardly.[31](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn31)\nThe kite’s cumbersome flight caught Lucio’s attention. It disrupted the\nexpectation that raptors should exhibit swift and powerful flight. Similarly\nthe ornithologists Hilty and Brown (1986: 91) describe the hook-billed kite as\nhaving unusually “broad lanky wings” and being “rather sedentary and\nsluggish.” Compared to other raptors that exhibit swifter flight, this bird is\nanomalous. It disrupts our assumptions about raptors, and this is why its\nhabits are interesting.\n\nAnother example: upon returning home one morning from a hunt Hilario pulled\nout from his net bag an epiphytic cactus (Discocactus amazonicus) dotted with\npurple flowers. He called it viñarina panga or viñari panga, because, as he\nexplained, “pangamanda viñarin,” “it grows out of its leaves.” It has no\nparticular use, although, like other succulent epiphytes such as orchids, he\nthought that the macerated stem might make a good poultice to apply to cuts.\nBut because the leaves of this plant appear to grow out of other leaves,\nHilario found this plant strange. The name “viñari panga” gets at a botanical\nhabit that extends deep into the evolutionary past. Leaves do not grow out of\nother leaves. They can only grow out of the meristematic tissue located in\nbuds on twigs, stems, and branches. The ancestral group within the cacti, from\nwhich D. amazonicus is derived, originally lost its laminar photosynthetic\nleaves and developed succulent rounded photosynthetic stems. Those flattened\ngreen structures that grow out of each other in D. amazonicus are therefore\nnot true leaves. They are actually stems that function as leaves and for this\nreason they can grow out of each other. These leaflike stems appear to put\ninto question the habit that leaves sprout from stems. This is what makes them\ninteresting.\n\nWHOLES PRECEDE PARTS\n\nIn semiosis, as in biology, wholes precede parts; similarity precedes\ndifference (see Bateson 2002: 159). Thoughts and lives both begin as\nwholes—albeit ones that can be extremely vague and underspecified. A single-\ncelled embryo, however simple and undifferentiated, is just as whole as the\nmulticellular organism into which it will develop. An icon, however\nrudimentary its likeness, insofar as it is taken as a likeness, imperfectly\ncaptures the object of its similarity as a whole. It is only in the realm of\nthe machine that the differentiated part comes first and the assembled whole\nsecond.[32](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn32) Semiosis and life, by contrast, begin whole.\n\nAn image, then, is a semiotic whole, but as such it can be a very rough\napproximation of the habits it represents. One afternoon while drinking manioc\nbeer at Ascencio’s house we heard Sandra, Ascencio’s daughter, cry out from\nher garden some way off, “A snake! Come kill it!”[33](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn33)\nAscencio’s son Oswaldo rushed out, and I followed close behind. Although the\ncreature in question turned out to be an inoffensive\nwhipsnake,[34](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn34) Oswaldo killed it anyway with a blow from\nthe broad side of his machete and then severed and buried its\nhead.[35](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn35) As we walked back to the house Oswaldo pointed\nout a little stump that I had just stumbled on and noted that he had seen me\nstumble on the very same stump the day before on our return along that path\nafter a long day out hunting with his father and brother-in-law in the steep\nforested slopes west of Ávila.\n\nOn those walks with Oswaldo back to the house my ambulatory habits had only\nimperfectly matched the habits of the world. Because of fatigue or mild\ninebriation (the first time I had stumbled on that stump we had hiked more\nthan ten hours over very steep terrain and I was exhausted, the second time I\nhad just finished off several big bowls of manioc beer) I simply failed to\ninterpret some of the features of the path as salient. I acted as if there\nwere no obstacles. I could get away with this because my regular gait was an\ninterpretive habit—an image of the path—that was good enough for the challenge\nat hand. Given the conditions that we faced it didn’t really matter if the way\nI walked didn’t perfectly match the features of the path. If, however, we had\nbeen running, or if I had been burdened by a heavy load, or if it had been\nraining heavily, or if I had been a little bit more tipsy, that lack of fit\nmay well have become amplified, and instead of slightly stumbling I might well\nhave tripped and fallen.\n\nMy tipsy or fatigued representation of the forest path was so rudimentary that\nI failed to notice its differences. Until Oswaldo pointed it out to me I never\nnoticed the stump, or that I had stumbled on it—twice! My stumbling had become\nits own fixed habit. By virtue of the regularity my imperfect walking habit\nhad assumed—so regular that I could repeatedly kick the same stump on\nsuccessive days—it became visible to Oswaldo as its own anomalous habit. And\nyet, however imperfect its match to the path, my manner of walking was good\nenough. It got me home.\n\nBut there was something lost in that “good enough” habituated automatization.\nPerhaps that day walking back to Ascencio’s house, I had become, for a moment,\nmore like matter—“mind whose habits had become fixed”—and less a learning and\nyearning, living and growing self.\n\nUnexpected events, such as the sudden appearance of a stump across our\npath—when we manage to notice it—or Maxi’s peccary suddenly reviving can\ndisrupt our assumptions of how the world is. And it is this very disruption,\nthe breakdown of old habits and the rebuilding of new ones, that constitutes\nour feeling of being alive and in the world. The world is revealed to us, not\nby the fact that we come to have habits, but in the moments when, forced to\nabandon our old habits, we come to take up new ones. This is where we can\ncatch glimpses—however mediated—of the emergent real to which we also\ncontribute.\n\nTHE OPEN WHOLE\n\nRecognizing how semiosis is something broader than the symbolic can allow us\nto see the ways we come to inhabit an ever-emerging world beyond the human. An\nanthropology beyond the human aims to reach beyond the confines of that one\nhabit—the symbolic—that makes us the exceptional kinds of beings that we\nbelieve we are. The goal is not to minimize the unique effects this habit has\nbut only to show some of the different ways in which the whole that is the\nsymbolic is open to those many other habits that can and do proliferate in the\nworld that extends beyond us. The goal, in short, is to regain a sense of the\nways in which we are open wholes.\n\nThis world beyond the human, to which we are open, is more than something “out\nthere” because the real is more than that which exists. Accordingly, an\nanthropology beyond the human seeks a slight displacement of our temporal\nfocus to look beyond the here and now of actuality. It must, of course, look\nback to constraints, contingencies, contexts, and conditions of possibility.\nBut the lives of signs, and of the selves that come to interpret them, are not\njust located in the present, or in the past. They partake in a mode of being\nthat extends into the future possible as well. Accordingly, this anthropology\nbeyond the human aims to attend to the prospective reality of these sorts of\ngenerals as well as to their eventual effects in a future present.\n\nIf our subject, the human, is an open whole, so too should be our method. The\nparticular semiotic properties that make humans open to the world beyond the\nhuman are the same ones that can allow anthropology to explore this with\nethnographic and analytical precision. The realm of the symbolic is an open\nwhole because it is sustained by, and ultimately cashed out in, a broader,\ndifferent kind of whole. That broader whole is an image. As Marilyn Strathern\nonce said to me, paraphrasing Roy Wagner, “You can’t have half an image.” The\nsymbolic is one particular human-specific way to come to feel an image. All\nthought begins and ends with an image. All thoughts are wholes, however long\nthe paths that will bring them there may be.[36](Notes.xhtml#ch1fn36)\n\nThis anthropology, like semiosis and life, does not start with difference,\notherness, or incommensurability. Nor does it start with intrinsic likeness.\nIt begins with the likeness of thought-at-rest—the likeness of not yet\nnoticing those eventual differences that might come to disrupt it. Likenesses,\nsuch as tsupu, are special kinds of open wholes. An icon is, on the one hand,\nmonadic, closed unto itself, regardless of anything else. It is like its\nobject whether or not that object exists. I feel tsupu whether or not you do.\nAnd yet, insofar as it stands for something else, it is an opening as well. An\nicon has the “capacity of revealing unexpected truth”: “by direct observation\nof it other truths concerning its object can be discovered” (Peirce CP 2.279).\nPeirce’s example is an algebraic formula: because the terms to the left of the\nequals sign are iconic of those to the right we can learn something more about\nthe latter by considering the former. That which is to the left is a whole. It\ncaptures that which is to its right in its totality. And yet in the process it\nis also able to suggest, “in a very precise way, new aspects of supposed\nstates of things” (CP 2.281). This is possible, thanks to the general way it\nstands for this totality. Signs stand for objects “not in all respects but in\nreference to a sort of idea” (CP 2.228). This idea, however vague, is a whole.\n\nAttending to the revelatory power of images suggests a way to practice an\nanthropology that can relate ethnographic particulars to something broader.\nThe inordinate emphasis on iconicity in lowland Quichua amplifies and makes\napparent certain general properties of language and the relation that language\nhas to that which lies beyond it, just as panic exaggerates and therefore\nmakes apparent other properties. These amplifications or exaggerations can\nfunction as images that can reveal something general about their objects. Such\ngenerals are real despite the fact that they lack the concreteness of the\nspecific or the fixed normativity of those putative universals that\nanthropology rightly rejects. It is to such general reals that an anthropology\nbeyond the human can gesture. It does so, however, in a particularly worldly\nway. It grounds itself in the mundane strivings and stumblings that emerge in\nthe ethnographic moment, with a view to how such contingent everydays make\napparent something about general problems.\n\nMy hope is that this anthropology can open itself to some of the new and\nunexpected habits just coming into being that might catch it up. By opening\nitself to novelty, images, and feelings, it seeks the freshness of firstness\nin its subject and method. I ask you to feel tsupu for yourself, and this is\nsomething I cannot force upon you. But it is also an anthropology of\nsecondness in that it hopes to register how it is surprised by the effects of\nsuch spontaneities as they come to make a difference in a messy world that is\nthe emergent product of all the ways in which its motley inhabitants engage\nwith and attempt to make sense of each other. Finally, this is an anthropology\nof the general, for it aims to recognize those opportunities where an us that\nexceeds the limits of individual bodies, species, and even concrete existence\ncan come to extend beyond the present. This us—and the hopeful worlds it\nbeckons us to imagine and realize—is an open whole.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n![](images/img_0008.jpg)\n\nTWO\n\n* * *\n\nThe Living Thought\n\nFunes not only remembered every leaf on every tree of every wood, but even\nevery one of the times he had perceived or imagined it. . . . I suspect,\nhowever, that he wasn’t very capable of thinking. Thinking is forgetting\ndifferences.\n\n—Jorge Luis Borges, Funes el Memorioso\n\nHarvesting fish poison roots[1](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn1) in the woody thickets that\nused to be their gardens, Amériga and Luisa were within earshot when it\nhappened. Back at home, as they talked with Delia over bowls of manioc beer,\nLuisa imitated how through the brush she had heard the family’s dogs—Pucaña,\nor Red Face, their favorite; Cuqui, her aging companion; and Huiqui—barking\nexcitedly, “‘hua’ hua’ hua’ hua’ hua’ hua’ hua’ hua’ hua,’” the way they do\nwhen they’re following game. Then she heard them barking, “‘ya ya ya ya,’”\npoised to attack. But then something very disturbing happened. The dogs\nstarted yelping, “‘aya—i aya—i aya—i,’” indicating that now they had been\nattacked and were in great pain.\n\n“And that,” Luisa remarked, “was it. They just fell\nsilent.”[2](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn2)\n\n> chun\n>\n> silence\n\nHow could things have changed so suddenly? For the women, the answer turned on\nimagining how the dogs understood, or, more accurately, failed to understand,\nthe world around them. Reflecting on the first two series of barks, Luisa\nremarked, “That’s what they’d do if they came across something big.” That’s\nwhat they would do, that is, if they came across a big game animal. “‘Was it a\ndeer they were barking at?’” Luisa remembered asking herself. That would make\nsense. Just a few days before, the dogs had tracked down, attacked, and killed\na deer. And we were still eating the meat.\n\nBut what creature might look to the dogs like prey but then turn on them? The\nwomen concluded that there was only one possible explanation; the dogs must\nhave confused a mountain lion with a red brocket deer. Both have tawny coats\nand are approximately the same size. Luisa tried to imagine what they were\nthinking: “It looks like a deer, let’s bite it!”\n\nDelia concisely summed up their frustration with the dogs’ confusion: “So so\nstupid.” Amériga elaborated: “How is it that they didn’t know? How is it that\nthey could even think [of barking], ‘yau yau yau,’ as if they were going to\nattack it?”\n\nWhat each bark meant was clear, for these barks are part of an exhaustive\nlexicon of canine vocalizations that people in Ávila feel they know. What was\nless obvious was what, from the dogs’ perspectives, prompted them to bark in\nthose ways. To imagine that the dogs might fail to discriminate between a\nmountain lion and a deer and to trace out the tragic consequences of that\nconfusion—the dogs just saw something big and tawny and attacked it—required\nthinking beyond what in particular the dogs did, to how it was that what they\ndid was motivated by how they came to understand the world around them. The\nconversation began to revolve around the question of how dogs think.\n\nThis chapter develops the claim that all living beings, and not just humans,\nthink, and explores another closely related claim, that all thoughts are\nalive. It is about “the living thought.”[3](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn3) What does it\nmean to think? What does it mean to be alive? Why are these two questions\nrelated, and how does our approach to them, especially when seen in terms of\nthe challenges of relating to other kinds of beings, change our understanding\nof relationality and “the human”?\n\nIf thoughts are alive and if that which lives thinks, then perhaps the living\nworld is enchanted. What I mean is that the world beyond the human is not a\nmeaningless one made meaningful by humans.[4](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn4) Rather,\nmean-ings—means-ends relations, strivings, purposes, telos, intentions,\nfunctions and significance—emerge in a world of living thoughts beyond the\nhuman in ways that are not fully exhausted by our all-too-human attempts to\ndefine and control these.[5](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn5) More precisely, the forests\naround Ávila are animate. That is, these forests house other emergent loci of\nmean-ings, ones that do not necessarily revolve around, or originate from,\nhumans. This is what I’m getting at when I say that forests think. It is to an\nexamination of such thoughts that this anthropology beyond the human now\nturns.\n\nIf thoughts exist beyond the human, then we humans are not the only selves in\nthis world. We, in short, are not the only kinds of we. Animism, the\nattribution of enchantment to these other-than-human loci, is more than a\nbelief, an embodied practice, or a foil for our critiques of Western\nmechanistic representations of nature, although it is also all of these as\nwell. We should not, then, just ask how some humans come to represent other\nbeings or entities as animate; we also need to consider more broadly what is\nit about these that make them animate.\n\nPeople in Ávila, if they are to successfully penetrate the relational logics\nthat create, connect, and sustain the beings of the forest, must in some way\nrecognize this basic animacy. Runa animism, then, is a way of attending to\nliving thoughts in the world that amplifies and reveals important properties\nof lives and thoughts. It is a form of thinking about the world that grows out\nof a specially situated intimate engagement with thoughts-in-the-world in ways\nthat make some of their distinctive attributes visible. Paying attention to\nthese engagements with the living thoughts of the world can help us think\nanthropology differently. It can help us imagine a set of conceptual tools we\ncan use to attend to the ways in which our lives are shaped by how we live in\na world that extends beyond the human.\n\nDogs, for example, are selves because they think. Counterintuitively, however,\nproof that they think is that they, in Delia’s words, can be “so so stupid”—so\nindifferent, so dumb. That the dogs in the forest were considered capable of\nconfusing a mountain lion with a deer suggests an important question: How is\nit that indifference, confusion, and forgetting are so central to the lives of\nthoughts and the selves that come to house them? The strange and productive\npower of confusion in the living thought challenges some of our basic\nassumptions about the roles that difference and otherness, on the one hand,\nand identity, on the other, play in social theory. This can help us rethink\nrelationality in ways that can take us beyond our tendency to apply our\nassumptions about the logic of linguistic relationality to all the many\npossible ways in which selves might relate.\n\nNONHUMAN SELVES\n\nThe women certainly felt they were able to interpret the dogs’ barks, but\nthat’s not what makes them recognize their dogs as selves. What makes their\ndogs selves is that their barks were manifestations of their interpretations\nof the world around them. And how those dogs interpreted the world around\nthem, as the women were amply aware, matters vitally. We humans, then, are not\nthe only ones who interpret the world. “Aboutness”—representation, intention,\nand purpose in their most basic forms—is an intrinsic structuring feature of\nliving dynamics in the biological world. Life is inherently\nsemiotic.[6](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn6)\n\nThis intrinsically semiotic characteristic applies to all biological\nprocesses. Take for example the following evolutionary adaptation: the\nelongated snout and tongue of the giant anteater. The giant anteater, or\ntamanuhua, as it is known in Ávila, can be deadly if cornered. One Ávila man\nwas almost killed by one during my time there (see chapter 6), and even\njaguars are said to keep well away from them (see chapter 3). The giant\nanteater is also ethereal. I caught a fleeting glimpse of one off in the\ndistance in the forest as Hilario, Lucio, and I were resting on a log on a\nridge above the Suno River late one afternoon. Its image still impresses\nitself on me today: the silhouette of a tapered head, a stocky body, and an\nenormous splayed fan of a tail around whose hairs the late afternoon sun’s\nrays passed.\n\nGiant anteaters feed exclusively on ants. They do so by inserting their\nelongated snouts into ant colony tunnels. The specific shape of the anteater’s\nsnout and tongue captures certain features of its environment, namely, the\nshape of ant tunnels. This evolutionary adaptation is a sign to the extent\nthat it is interpreted (in a very bodily way, for there is no consciousness or\nreflection here) by a subsequent generation with respect to what this sign is\nabout (i.e., the shape of ant tunnels). This interpretation, in turn, is\nmanifested in the development of the subsequent organism’s body in a way that\nincorporates these adaptations. This body (with its adaptations) functions as\na new sign representing these features of the environment, insofar as it, in\nturn, will be interpreted as such by another subsequent generation of\nanteaters in the eventual development of that generation’s body.\n\nAnteater snouts over the generations have come to represent with increasing\naccuracy something about the geometry of ant colonies because those lineages\nof “protoanteaters” whose snouts and tongues less accurately captured relevant\nenvironmental features (e.g., the shapes of ant tunnels) did not survive as\nwell. Relative to these protoanteaters, then, today’s living anteaters have\ncome to exhibit comparatively increasing “fittedness” (Deacon 2012) to these\nenvironmental features. They are more nuanced and exhaustive representations\nof it.[7](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn7) It is in this sense that the logic of\nevolutionary adaptation is a semiotic one.\n\nLife, then, is a sign process. Any dynamic in which “something . . . stands to\nsomebody, for something in some respect or capacity,” as Peirce’s (CP 2.228)\ndefinition of a sign has it, would be alive. Elongated snouts and tongues\nstand to a future anteater (a “somebody”) for something about the architecture\nof an ant colony. One of Peirce’s most important contributions to semiotics is\nto look beyond the classical dyadic understanding of signs as something that\nstands for something else. Instead, he insisted, we should recognize a crucial\nthird variable as an irreducible component of semiosis: signs stand for\nsomething in relation to a “somebody” (Colapietro 1989: 4). As the giant\nanteater illustrates, this “somebody”—or a self, as I prefer to call it—is not\nnecessarily human, and it need not involve symbolic reference, subjectivity,\nthe sense of interiority, consciousness, or the awareness we often associate\nwith representation for it to count as such (see Deacon 2012: 465–66).\n\nFurthermore, selfhood is not limited just to animals with brains. Plants are\nalso selves. Nor is it coterminous with a physically bounded organism. That\nis, selfhood can be distributed over bodies (a seminar, a crowd, or an ant\ncolony can act as a self), or it can be one of many other selves within a body\n(individual cells have a kind of minimal selfhood).\n\nSelf is both the origin and the product of an interpretive process; it is a\nwaypoint in semiosis (see chapter 1). A self does not stand outside the\nsemiotic dynamic as “Nature,” evolution, watchmaker, homuncular vital spirit,\nor (human) observer. Rather, selfhood emerges from within this semiotic\ndynamic as the outcome of a process that produces a new sign that interprets a\nprior one. It is for this reason that it is appropriate to consider nonhuman\norganisms as selves and biotic life as a sign process, albeit one that is\noften highly embodied and nonsymbolic.\n\nMEMORY AND ABSENCE\n\nThe giant anteater as a self is a form that selectively “remembers” its own\nform. That is, a subsequent generation is a likeness of a previous one. It is\nan iconic representation of its ancestor. But at the same time as such an\nanteater is a likeness of its forebear (and is thus a sort of memory of it) it\nalso differs from it. For this anteater, with its snout and tongue, can\npotentially be a relatively more detailed representation of the world around\nit, insofar (in this case) as its snout, when compared to that of its\nancestor, better fits ant tunnels. In sum, the way this anteater remembers or\nre-presents the generations that came before it is “selective.” This is so, in\npart, thanks to those past protoanteater selves whose snouts didn’t “fit”\ntheir environments as well and who were thus, in a sense, forgotten.\n\nThis play of remembering and forgetting is both unique and central to life;\nany lineage of living organism—plant or animal—will exhibit this\ncharacteristic. Contrast this with, say, a snowflake. Although the particular\nform that a given snowflake takes is a historically contingent product of the\ninteraction with its environment as it falls to the ground (and this is why we\nthink of snowflakes as exhibiting a sort of individuality; no two are alike)\nthe particular form a snowflake takes is never selectively remembered. That\nis, once it melts its form will have no bearing on the form that any\nsubsequent snowflake will take as it begins to fall to the ground.\n\nLiving beings differ from snowflakes because life is intrinsically semiotic,\nand semiosis is always for a self. The form an individual anteater takes comes\nto represent, for a future instantiation of itself, the environment its\nlineage has come to fit over evolutionary time. Anteater lineages selectively\nremember their previous fits to their environments; snowflakes don’t.\n\nA self, then, is the outcome of a process, unique to life, of maintaining and\nperpetuating an individual form, a form that, as it is iterated over the\ngenerations, grows to fit the world around it at the same time that it comes\nto exhibit a certain circular closure that allows it to maintain its selfsame\nidentity, which is forged with respect to that which it is not (Deacon 2012:\n471); anteaters re-present previous representations of ant tunnels in their\nlineage, but they are not themselves ant tunnels. Insofar as it strives to\nmaintain its form, such a self acts for itself. A self, then, whether “skin-\nbound” or more distributed, is the locus of what we can call agency (479–80).\n\nBecause a giant anteater is a sign, what it is—its particular configuration,\nthe fact, for example, that it has an elongated, as opposed to some other\nshape of snout—cannot be understood without considering what it is about,\nnamely, the relevant environment that it increasingly comes to fit through the\ndynamic I’ve just described. Therefore, although semiosis is embodied, it also\nalways involves something more than bodies. It is about something absent: a\nsemiotically mediated future environment, which is potentially like the\nenvironment to which the past generation fit (see chapter 1).\n\nA living sign is a prediction of what Peirce calls a habit (see chapter 1).\nThat is, it is an expectation of a regularity, something that has not yet come\nto exist but will likely come to be. Snouts are products of what they are not,\nnamely, the possibility that there will be ant tunnels in the environment into\nwhich the snouted anteater will come to live. They are the products of an\nexpectation—of a highly embodied “guess” at what the future will hold.\n\nThis is a result of another important absence. As I mentioned earlier, the\nsnouts and the way they fit with the world around them are the result of all\nthe previous wrong “guesses”—the previous generations whose snouts were less\nlike that world of ant tunnels. Because the snouts of these protoanteaters\ndidn’t fit the geometry of ant tunnels quite as well as the snouts of others,\ntheir forms did not survive into the future.\n\nThis way in which selves strive to predict “absent” futures also manifests\nitself in the purported behavior of Amériga’s dogs. The dogs must have barked,\nthe women imagined, at what they expected and trusted was a deer. More\naccurately, perhaps, they barked at something they saw as big and tawny.\nUnfortunately, however, mountain lions are also big and tawny. A semiotically\nmediated future—the possibility of attacking the perceived deer—came to affect\nthe present. It influenced the dogs’ decision—“so stupid” in hindsight—to\nchase the creature they thought was prey.\n\nLIFE AND THOUGHT\n\nA lineage of signs can potentially extend into the future as an emergent\nhabit, insofar as each instantiation will interpret the previous one in a way\nthat can, in turn, be interpreted by a future one. This applies equally to a\nbiological organism, whose progeny may or may not survive into the future, as\nit does to this book, whose ideas may or may not be taken up in the thinking\nof a future reader (see Peirce CP 7.591). Such a process is what constitutes\nlife. That is, any kind of life, be it human, biological, or even, someday,\ninorganic, will spontaneously exhibit this embodied, localized,\nrepresentational, future-predicting dynamic that captures, amplifies, and\nproliferates the tendency toward habit taking in a future instantiation of\nitself. Another way of saying this is that any entity that stands as a locus\nof aboutness, within a lineage of such loci that can potentially extend into\nthe future, can be said to be alive. The origins of life—any kind of life,\nanywhere in the universe—also necessarily marks the origins of semiosis and of\nself.\n\nIt also marks the origins of thought. Life-forms—human and nonhuman\nalike—because they are intrinsically semiotic, exhibit what Peirce calls a\n“‘scientific’ intelligence.” By “scientific,” he does not mean an intelligence\nthat is human, conscious, or even rational but simply one that is “capable of\nlearning by experience” (CP 2.227). Selves, as opposed to snowflakes, can\nlearn by experience, which is another way of saying that, through the semiotic\nprocess I’ve been describing, they can grow. And this, in turn, is another way\nof saying that selves think. Such thinking need not happen in the time scale\nwe chauvinistically call real time (see Dennett 1996: 61). It need not happen,\nthat is, within the life of a single skin-bound organism. Biological lineages\nalso think. They too, over the generations, can grow to learn by experience\nabout the world around them, and as such they too demonstrate a “‘scientific’\nintelligence.” In sum, because life is semiotic and semiosis is alive, it\nmakes sense to treat both lives and thoughts as “living thoughts.” This\ndeepened understanding of the close relationship between life, self, and\nthought is central to this anthropology beyond the human that I am developing\nhere.\n\nAN ECOLOGY OF SELVES\n\nThe semiotic quality of life—the fact that the forms that life takes are the\nproduct of how living selves represent the world around them—structures the\ntropical ecosystem. Although all life is semiotic, this semiotic quality is\namplified and made more apparent in the tropical forest, with its unparalleled\nkinds and quantities of living selves. This is why I want to find ways to\nattend to how forests think; tropical forests amplify, and thus can make more\napparent to us, the ways life thinks.\n\nThe worlds that selves represent are not just made up of things. They are\nalso, in large part, made up of other semiotic selves. For this reason I have\ncome to refer to the web of living thoughts in and around the forests of Ávila\nas an ecology of selves. This ecology of selves in and around Ávila includes\nthe Runa as well as other humans who interact with them and the forest, and it\nholds in its configurations not only the many kinds of living beings of the\nforest but also, as I discuss toward the end of this book, the spirits and the\ndead that make us the living beings that we are.\n\nHow different kinds of beings represent and are represented by other kinds of\nbeings defines the patterning of life in the forests around Ávila. For\nexample, once a year the colonies of leafcutter ants (Atta spp.)—whose\npresence is normally visible only in the long files of workers carrying to\ntheir nests snippets of vegetation they have culled from treetops—change their\nactivity. Over the space of a few minutes, each widely dispersed colony\nsimultaneously disgorges hundreds upon hundreds of plump winged reproductive\nants and sends them flying into the early morning sky to mate with those from\nother colonies. This event poses, and indeed is structured by, a variety of\nchallenges and opportunities. How do the ants, living in far-flung colonies,\nmanage to coordinate their flights? How can predators tap into this rich but\nephemeral cache? And what strategies do the ants use to avoid being eaten?\nThese flying ants, overburdened with fat reserves, are a savory delicacy that\npeople in Ávila, as well as many others who live in the Amazon, covet.\nIndicative of how much they are valued, they are known simply as añangu, ants.\nToasted with salt they are a delicacy, and collected by the potful they are an\nimportant food source during the limited time they are available. How do\npeople manage to predict the few minutes in each year when these will come out\nof their underground nests?\n\nThe problem of when the ants fly can tell us something about how the rain\nforest comes to be what it is: an emergent and expanding multilayered\ncacophonous web of mutually constitutive, living, and growing thoughts.\nBecause in this part of the equatorial tropics there are no marked seasonal\nchanges in sunlight or temperature, and no corresponding spring bloom, there\nis no one stable cue external to the interactions among forest beings that\ndetermines or predicts when ants will fly. The timing of this event is a\nproduct of the coordinated prediction of seasonal meteorological regularities\nas well as an orchestration among different, competing, and interpreting\nspecies.\n\nAccording to people in Ávila the winged ants emerge in the calm that follows a\nperiod of heavy rains that includes thunder and lightning and the flooding of\nrivers. This stormy period brings to a close a relatively drier period that\nusually occurs around August. People try to predict the emergence of the ants\nby linking it to a variety of ecological signs associated with fruiting\nregimes, increases in insect populations, and changes in animal\nactivity.[8](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn8) When the various indicators point to the fact\nthat “ant season” (añangu uras) is at hand, people go to the various nests\naround their houses several times throughout the night to check for the\ntelltale signs that the ants will soon take flight. These signs include the\npresence of guards clearing entrances of debris and sightings of a few slowly\nemerging and still somewhat lethargic winged ants.\n\nPeople in Ávila are not the only ones interested in when these ants will fly.\nOther creatures, such as frogs, snakes, and small\nfelines,[9](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn9) are attracted to the ants, as well as to those\nother animals that are attracted to the ants. They all watch the ants and\nwatch those watching the ants for signs of when the ants will emerge from\ntheir nests.\n\nAlthough the day of the flight is closely linked to meteorological patterns,\nand this seems to be how the ants coordinate their flights with those from\nother nests, the precise moment at which the flight will take place on that\nday is a response, sedimented over evolutionary time, to what it is that\npotential predators might, or might not, notice. It is no accident that the\nants take flight just before daybreak (at exactly 5:10, when I’ve been able to\ntime it). When they are in their nests the aggressive guards of the colony\nprotect them from snakes, frogs, and other predators. Once they take flight,\nhowever, they are on their own, and they can fall prey to the lingering fruit-\neating bats still out at twilight who attack them in midflight by biting off\ntheir greatly enlarged, fat-filled abdomens.\n\nHow bats see the world matters vitally to the flying ants. It is no accident\nthat the ants take flight at the time they do. Although some lingering bats\nare still out, by this time they will only be active for twenty or thirty\nminutes longer. When the birds come out (not long after a six o’clock sunrise)\nmost of the ants will have already dispersed, and some females will have\nalready copulated and fallen to the ground to establish new colonies. The\nprecise timing of the ant flight is an outcome of a semiotically structured\necology. The ants emerge at twilight—that blurry zone between night and\nday—when nocturnal and diurnal predators are least likely to notice them.\n\nPeople attempt to enter some of the logic of the semiotic network that\nstructures ant life in order to capture the ants during those few minutes in\nthe year when they fly out of their nests. One night, as the ants were about\nto fly, Juanicu asked me for a cigarette so that he could blow tobacco smoke\ninfused with the power of his “life breath” (samai) in order to send the\nimpending rain clouds away. If it rained that evening the ants would not\nemerge. His wife, Olga, however, urged him not to ward off the rain clouds.\nShe feared that their sons, who had gone to market in Loreto, would not return\nfrom town until the following day. They would be needed to harvest the ants\nthat would be pouring out of the various nests around the house. To make sure\nthe ants would not fly that night, she went out to all the nearby nests and\nstomped on them. This, she said, would keep the ants from coming out that\nevening.\n\nOn the night that Juanicu felt sure the ants would finally fly, he urged me,\nbefore I went out with his children in the middle of the night to check the\nnests, not to kick or step heavily around the nest. Then, shortly before five\nin the morning, at a distance of about four meters from the entrance of the\nnest closest to the house, Juanicu and I placed some lit kerosene lanterns as\nwell as some of my candles and my flashlight. The winged ants are attracted to\nlight and would be drawn to these sources. The lights were placed far enough\naway, however, so that the guards would not consider them threatening.\n\nAs the ants began to emerge Juanicu spoke only in whispers. Shortly after five\no’clock we could hear a buzzing as the winged ants began to come out from the\nnest and fly off. Many of these were attracted by the light and came to us\ninstead of flying to the sky. Juanicu then began to whistle like a siren\nalternating between two different pitches. This, he later explained, is\nsomething the flying ants understand as the call of their\n“mothers.”[10](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn10) As the ants came to us, we singed off\ntheir wings with torches made of dry lisan leaves.[11](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn11) We\nwere then easily able to place them into covered\npots.[12](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn12)\n\nThe leafcutter ants are immersed in an ecology of selves that has shaped their\nvery being; that they emerge just before dawn is an effect of the interpretive\npropensities of their major predators. People in Ávila also attempt to tap\ninto the communicative universe of the ants and of the many creatures\nconnected to them. Such a strategy has practical effects; people are able to\ngather vast quantities of ants based on them.\n\nBy treating ants as the intentional communicating selves they are, Juanicu was\nable to arrive at an understanding of the various associations that link ants\nto the other beings in the forest—an understanding that is surely never\nabsolute but sufficient to accurately predict the few moments in the year when\nthese ants will fly. He was also able to communicate directly with them,\ncalling them to their deaths. In doing so he was, in effect, entering the\nlogic of how forests think. This is possible because his (and our) thoughts\nare in important respects like those that structure the relations among those\nliving thoughts that make the forest what it is: a dense, flourishing, ecology\nof selves.\n\nSEMIOTIC DENSITY\n\nThe interrelations among so many different semiotic life-forms in this dense\necology of selves result in a relatively more nuanced and exhaustive overall\nrepresentation of the surrounding environment when compared to the way life\nrepresents elsewhere on the planet. That is, the “thoughts” of a tropical\nforest come to represent the world in a relatively more detailed way. For\nexample, a number of tropical tree species have evolved as specialists that\ngrow only on white-sand soils. Tropical white-sand soils, as contrasted to\ntropical clay soils, are nutrient-poor, do not hold water well, and have\ncharacteristics such as high acidity that can slow plant growth. However, it\nis not the soil conditions in themselves that account for the fact that there\nare specialists that live on white-sand soils. Rather, the fact that there are\nsuch specialists is the result of their relation to another set of life-forms:\nplant-eating organisms, or herbivores (Marquis 2004: 619).\n\nBecause of the extremely poor conditions of these white-sand soils, plants\nhave difficulty repairing themselves fast enough to sustain the levels of\nnutrient loss incurred by herbivory. Thus there is great selective pressure\nfor plants living on such nutrient-poor soils to develop highly specialized\ntoxic compounds and other defenses against herbivory (Marquis 2004: 620).\n\nInterestingly, however, soil differences do not directly affect what kinds of\nplants can grow where. Fine, Mesones, and Coley (2004) have shown that when\nherbivores are experimentally removed from poor-soil plots and rich-soil\nspecies experimentally transplanted in the rich-soil species actually grow\nbetter than those adapted to poor soils.\n\nSo one could say that tropical plants come to represent something about their\nsoil environments by virtue of their interactions with the herbivores that\namplify the differences in soil conditions and thus make these differences\nimportant to plants. That is, differences in soil types wouldn’t make a\ndifference to the plants if it weren’t for these other life-forms. This is why\nrich-soil plants, not burdened by the need to produce energetically costly\ntoxins, grow better than poor-soil plants in poor-soils plots that have been\nkept free of herbivores experimentally.[13](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn13)\n\nIn temperate regions, where insectivorous herbivores are far fewer, there is\nvery little specialization of plants to soil type even in areas where soil\nheterogeneity (i.e., the juxtaposition of nutrient rich and poor soils) is\nhigher than in tropical regions (Fine 2004: 2). Another way to say this is\nthat plants in the tropics, as opposed to those in temperate regions, come to\nform relatively more nuanced representations of the characteristics of their\nenvironments. They make more differentiations among soil types because of the\nways they are caught up in a relatively denser web of living thoughts.\n\nThis herbivore-dependent amplification effect of soil differences does not\nstop with plants but continues to propagate through the ecology of selves.\nTannin, for example, is a chemical defense that many Amazonian poor-soil\nplants have developed against herbivores. Because microorganisms cannot easily\nbreak down tannin-rich leaf litter, this compound leaches into rivers where it\nis toxic to fish and many other organisms. As a consequence, ecosystems\nassociated with rivers that drain large expanses of white-sand soil are not\nable to support as much animal life (Janzen 1974), and historically this has\nhad an important impact on humans living in the Amazon (Moran 1993). The\nvarious forms that all these ecologically related kinds of life take are not\nreducible to the characteristics of soil. I’m not making an argument for\nenvironmental determinism.[14](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn14) And yet this multispecies\nassemblage captures and amplifies something about the differences in soil\nconditions precisely as a function of the greater number of relations\n(relative to other ecosystems) among kinds of selves that exist in this\necology of selves.\n\nRELATIONALITY\n\nSelves, in short, are thoughts, and the modes by which such selves relate to\none another stem from their constitutively semiotic nature and the particular\nassociational logics this entails. Considering the logic by which these selves\nrelate in this ecology of selves challenges us to rethink\nrelationality—arguably our field’s fundamental concern and central analytic\n(Strathern 1995).\n\nIf selves are thoughts and the logic through which they interact is semiotic,\nthen relation is representation. That is, the logic that structures relations\namong selves is the same as that which structures relations among signs. This,\nin itself, is not a new idea. Whether or not we are explicit about it we\nalready tend to think of relationality in terms of representation in the ways\nwe theorize society and culture. But we do so based on our assumptions about\nhow human symbolic representation works (see chapter 1). Like the words that\nexist in the conventional relational configurations that make up a language,\nthe relata—be these ideas, roles, or institutions—that make up a culture or a\nsociety, do not precede the mutually constitutive relationships these relata\nhave with one another in a system that necessarily comes to exhibit a certain\nclosure by virtue of this fact.\n\nEven posthuman relational concepts, such as Bruno Latour’s “actant,” the\nnetworks of actor-network theory, and Haraway’s “constitutive intra-action”\n(Haraway 2008: 32, 33), rely on assumptions about relationality that stem from\nthe special kinds of relational properties we find in human language. In fact,\nin some versions of actor-network theory the relational networks that connect\nhumans and nonhuman entities are explicitly described as languagelike (see Law\nand Mol 2008: 58).[15](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn15)\n\nBut representation, as I have been arguing, is something both broader than and\ndifferent from what we expect given how our thinking about it has been\nlinguistically colonized. Extending linguistic relationality to nonhumans\nnarcissistically projects the human onto that which lies beyond it. And along\nwith language comes a host of assumptions about systematicity, context, and\ndifference, which stem from some of the distinctive properties of human\nsymbolic reference and are not necessarily relevant to how living thoughts\nmight more generally relate. In the process, other properties that might\npermit a more capacious view of relationality are obscured. My claim, in\nshort, is that an anthropology beyond the human can rethink relationality by\nseeing it as semiotic but not always and necessarily languagelike.\n\nConsider, in this regard, the relation between a wood tick and the mammals it\nparasitizes, a relation made classic by the early-twentieth-century ethologist\nJakob von Uexküll (1982). Ticks, according to von Uexküll, perceive mammals,\nwhose blood they suck, from the smell of butyric acid, warmth, and the ability\nto detect the bare patches of mammalian skin where they can burrow. According\nto him, their experiential world, or umwelt as he called it, is limited to\njust these three parameters (Uexküll 1982: 57, 72). For von Uexküll, and many\nof those who have picked up on his work, the tick’s experiential world is\nclosed and “poor,” in the sense that the tick doesn’t differentiate among many\nentities (see Agamben 2004). But I want to emphasize the productive power of\nthis simplification that is central to living thoughts and to the relations\nthat emerge among the selves that are the products of living thoughts. And I\nwant to highlight the fact that its relational logic is semiotic but not\ndistinctively symbolic.\n\nTicks do not distinguish among many kinds of mammals. It makes no difference\nto ticks that, for example, a dog might be wise to distinguish a predatory\nmountain lion from potential prey like the red brocket deer. The tick will\nconfuse these two with each other and these with the dogs as well.\n\nTicks are also vectors for parasites, and because of the ways ticks fail to\ndistinguish among mammals whose blood they indiscriminately suck, these\nparasites can pass from one species to another. This indiscrimination is a\nform of confusion, which of course has its limits. If the tick confused\neverything with everything else, there would be no thinking here and no life;\nconfusion is only productive when it is constrained.\n\nFor the tick, one kind of mammal is, in Peircean terms, iconic of another. I\nwant to highlight this view of iconism, which I introduced in the previous\nchapter, because it goes against our everyday understandings of the term. When\nwe treat icons (signs that signify through similarity) we usually think of the\nways in which we take them to be like some aspect of something else that we\nalready know to be different. We do not, as I mentioned, confuse a stick\nfigure depiction of a man posted on the door of a washroom with the person who\nmight enter through that door. But I’m alluding here to a more fundamental—and\noften misunderstood—iconic property, one that underlies all semiosis. To the\ntick, mammals are equivalent, simply because the tick doesn’t notice the\ndifferences among the beings it parasitizes.\n\nThis iconic confusion is productive. It creates “kinds.” There emerges a\ngeneral class of beings whose members are linked to each other because of the\nways they are all noticed by ticks, who do not discriminate among them. This\nemergence of a general class matters to the beings involved. Because the tick\nconfuses these warm-blooded beings, other parasites can travel among them (the\n“mammals”) through the tick. This, in fact, is how Lyme disease is transmitted\nfrom deer to humans.\n\nThe world of living beings is neither just a continuum nor a collection of\ndisparate singularities waiting to be grouped—according to social convention\nor innate propensity—by a human mind. It is true that categorization can be\nsocioculturally specific and that it can lead to a form of conceptual violence\nin that it erases the uniqueness of those categorized. And it is also true\nthat the power of human language lies in its ability to jump out of the local\nin ways that can result in an increased insensitivity to detail. Speaking of a\nJapanese insect collector, Hugh Raffles writes:\n\n> After collecting for so many years, he now has “mushi” eye, bug eyes, and\n> sees everything in nature from an insect’s point of view. Each tree is its\n> own world, each leaf is different. Insects taught him that general nouns\n> like insects, trees, leaves, and especially nature destroy our sensitivity\n> to detail. They make us conceptually as well as physically violent. “Oh, an\n> insect,” we say, seeing only the category, not the being itself. (2010: 345)\n\nAnd yet seeing the world with “bug eyes” in many instances actually involves\nconfusing what we might otherwise take as different entities, and this sort of\nconfusion is neither exclusively human nor only destructive.\n\nBorges’s character Ireneo Funes, mentioned in this chapter’s epigraph, was\nthrown by a wild horse and suffered a head injury, with the result that he\ncould no longer forget anything. He became “memorioso.” But living selves are\nprecisely not like Funes, who was incapable of forgetting the distinctive\nfeatures of “every leaf on every tree of every wood.” This, as Borges points\nout, is not thinking. The life of thoughts depends on confusion—a kind of\n“forgetting” to notice difference. Generals, such as kinds and classes, emerge\nfrom and flourish in the world through a form of relating based on confusion.\nThe real is not just the unique singularity, different from everything else.\nGenerals are also real, and some generals emerge as a product of the relations\namong living thoughts beyond the human.\n\nKNOWING WITHOUT KNOWING\n\nHow could Amériga, Delia, and Luisa presume to guess at what their dogs were\nthinking? More generally, how can we ever hope to know these other living\nselves with whom we relate? Even if we grant that nonhuman life-forms are\nselves, doesn’t there exist, in Derrida’s (2008: 30) words, such an “abyssal\nrupture” separating us from them that theirs might be better thought as an\n“existence that refuses to be conceptualized” (9)? Might these “absolute\nother[s]” (11) not be like Wittgenstein’s lion; even if they could talk, who\nwould understand them? Thomas Nagel’s (1974) answer to the question he posed\nhis fellow philosophers, What is it like to be a bat?, was decisive; although\nthere is surely something that it is like to be a bat—that bats, in effect,\nhave some kind of selfhood—we can never know it. We are just too different.\n\nGranted, Amériga, Luisa, and Delia will never know with certainty what their\ndogs were thinking as they barked at that feline moments before it attacked\nthem, but they could make some good guesses. What, then, might a theory of\nrelating look like that started, not with the search for some secure knowledge\nof other beings, but with the sorts of provisional guesses that these women\nwere forced to make about the guesses their dogs, in turn, might be making?\nSuch a theory would not begin with what Haraway (2003: 49) calls “irreducible\ndifference,” nor would it take the refusal to be conceptualized, or its\nlogical opposite, absolute understanding, as inhabitable endpoints.\n\nAbsolute otherness, irreducible difference, incommensurablity—these are taken\nto be the hurdles that our theories of relating must strive to overcome. That\nthere exist differences that are radically inconceivable—differences that are\nso unimaginable that they are “incognizable” as Peirce (1992d: 24) critically\ncalls them—implies an opposite: that knowability is based on intrinsic self-\nsimilarity. It implies that there exists such a thing as “being itself” in all\nits singularity, which we might comprehend if we could just adopt “bug eyes.”\nThese poles are taken to define how beings can relate to and know each other.\n\nHowever, when we consider “the living thought,” similarity and difference\nbecome interpretive positions (with potential future effects). They are not\nintrinsic characteristics that are immediately apparent. “All thought and\nknowledge,” writes Peirce, “is by signs” (CP 8.332). That is, all thinking and\nknowing is mediated in some way.\n\nThis has important implications for understanding relating. There is no\ninherent difference between the associations of living thoughts that\nconstitute the living thinking knowing self and those by which different kinds\nof selves might relate and thereby form associations. Further, because selves\nare loci of living thoughts—emergent ephemeral waypoints in a dynamic\nprocess—there is no unitary self. There is no one thing that one could “be”:\n“[A] person is not absolutely an individual. His thoughts are what he is\n‘saying to himself,’ that is, is saying to that other self that is just coming\ninto life in the flow of time” (Peirce CP 5.421). Because all experiences and\nall thoughts, for all selves, are semiotically mediated, introspection, human-\nto-human intersubjectivity, and even trans-species sympathy and communication\nare not categorically different. They are all sign processes. For Peirce, the\nCartesian cogito, the “I think,” is not exclusively human, nor is it housed\ninside the mind, nor does it enjoy any exclusive or unmediated purchase on its\nmost intimate object: the self that we commonly think of as the one doing our\nthinking.\n\nPeirce illustrates this by asking us to imagine what red looks like to others.\nFar from being a private phenomenon, he argues, we can be pretty confident\nthat we can have some sense of this. We can even have some idea of what this\ncolor is like to a blind person who has never seen red but who gathers from\nothers that it resembles the sound of trumpets: “The fact that I can see a\ncertain analogy, shows me not only that my feeling of redness is something\nlike the feelings of the persons whom he had heard talk, but also his feeling\nof a trumpet’s blare was very much like mine” (CP\n1.314).[16](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn16) Peirce concludes by suggesting that self-\nknowledge is ultimately like these processes: “My metaphysical friend who asks\nwhether we can ever enter into one another’s feelings . . . might just as well\nask me whether I am sure that red looked to me yesterday as it does today” (CP\n1.314). Introspection and intersubjectivity are semiotically mediated. We can\nonly come to know ourselves and others through the medium of signs. It makes\nno difference whether that interpreting self is located in another kind of\nbody or whether it is “that other self”—our own psychological one—“that is\njust coming into life in the flow of time,” as one sign is interpreted by a\nnew one in that semiotic process by which thoughts, minds, and our very being\nqua self emerge.\n\n![](images/img_0009.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5. What a hawk looks like to a parakeet. Photo by author.\n\nRather than make knowledge of selves impossible, this mediation is the basis\nfor its possibility. Because there is no absolute “incognizable” there is also\nno absolute incommensurability. We can know something of how red might be\nexperienced by a blind person, what it might be like to be a bat, or what\nthose dogs might have been thinking moments before they were attacked, however\nmediated, provisional, fallible, and tenuous these understandings may be.\nSelves relate the way that thoughts relate: we are all living, growing\nthoughts.\n\nA simple example illustrates this. The Runa make scarecrows, or more\naccurately “scare-parakeets,” in order to scare white-eyed parakeets from\ntheir cornfields. They do so by binding together in a cross two flattened\npieces of balsa wood of equal length. They paint these with red and black\nstripes using achiote[17](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn17) and charcoal, respectively.\nThey also carve the top part to fashion a head and paint big eyes on it, and\nthey sometimes insert the distinctively barred tail feathers of an actual\nraptor at the ends of the pieces of wood that will serve to represent the tail\nand the wings (see figure 5).\n\nThe elaborate fashion in which the Runa decorate this scarecrow is not an\nattempt to “realistically” represent a raptor from the human point of view.\nRather, it constitutes an attempt to imagine what from the parakeet’s\nperspective a raptor looks like. The scarecrow is an icon. It stands for a\nraptor by virtue of the likeness it has with the raptor for somebody—here, the\nparakeet. By virtue of stripes, big eyes, and actual tail feathers, the\nscarecrow captures something of what a raptor is like for a parakeet. This is\nwhy parakeets, but not humans, confuse these scarecrows with raptors. Proof of\nthis is that these scarecrows successfully keep parakeets away and are thus\nmade from year to year in Ávila. We can know something of what it is like to\nbe a parakeet, and we know this by the effects that our guesses at how\nparakeets think can have on them.\n\nENCHANTMENT\n\nIt is very difficult from within our contemporary analytical frameworks to\nunderstand the biological world as made up of living thoughts. This, following\nMax Weber’s (1948a, 1948b) diagnosis of the disenchantment of the modern\nworld, is in part an effect of the spread of scientific rationalism. As we\ncome to increasingly see the world in mechanistic terms we lose sight of the\ntelos, the significance, the means-ends relations—in short, the mean-ings, as\nI call them, to highlight the close relationship between means and\nmeanings—that were once recognized in the world. The world becomes\ndisenchanted in the sense that ends are no longer to be found in the world.\nThe world becomes literally meaningless. Ends become displaced to a human or\nspiritual realm that becomes ever smaller and more detached from the mundane\nworld as this vision of science expands to encompass more domains.\n\nIf modern forms of knowledge and ways of manipulating the nonhuman world are\ncharacterized by an understanding of the world as mechanism, then\ndisenchantment is an obvious consequence. Machines, as material objects, are\nmeans to achieve ends that are, by definition and design, external to them.\nWhen we contemplate a machine—say, a dishwasher—we bracket out the ends that\nare actually intrinsic to its being, namely, that it was built for some end by\nsomebody. Applying this logic to the nonhuman living world, seeing nature as a\nmachine, requires a similar bracketing and a subsequent ascription of ends to\nhumans, gods, or Nature. Dualism is one result of this bracketing. Another is\nthat we begin to lose sight of ends altogether. Disenchantment spreads into\nthe realm of the human and the spiritual as we come to suspect that perhaps\nthere simply are no ends and hence no meaning—anywhere.\n\nBut ends are not located somewhere outside the world but constantly\nflourishing in it. They are intrinsic to the realm of life. Living thoughts\n“guess” at and thus create futures to which they then shape themselves. Nor is\nthe logic that structures the living world like that of a machine. Unlike\nmachines, living thoughts emerge whole instead of being built from parts by\nsomeone bracketed out of the picture. If we attend to Runa engagements with\nother kinds of beings, as I aim to do here through this anthropology beyond\nthe human, we can come to appreciate selves (both human and nonhuman) as\nwaypoints in the lives of signs—loci of enchantment—and this can help us\nimagine a different sort of flourishing in this world beyond the human in\nwhich we live.\n\nI’m making a claim here about some of the properties of life “itself.”\nAlthough I recognize how something like life itself can be historically\ncircumscribed—that certain concepts can only become thinkable in specific\nhistorical, social, or cultural contexts (Foucault 1970)—I want to reiterate\nsomething I discussed more fully in the first chapter. Language and the\nrelated discursive regimes that condition so much of our thought and action\nare not closed. Although we must of course be cautious about the ways in which\nlanguage (and by extension, certain socially stabilized modes of thought and\naction) naturalizes categories of thought, we can venture to talk about\nsomething like life “itself” without being fully constrained by the language\nthat carries this forth.\n\nNonhuman selves, then, have ontologically unique properties associated with\ntheir constitutively semiotic nature. And these are, to a certain extent,\nknowable to us. These properties differentiate selves from objects or\nartifacts. Treating nonhumans generically—indiscriminately lumping together\nthings and beings—however, misses this. And this, to my mind, is the biggest\nshortcoming of STS, the dominant approach for expanding the social sciences to\nconsider nonhumans.\n\nSTS brings nonhumans and humans into the same analytical framework through a\nform of reductionism that leaves concepts like agency and representation\nunexamined. As a consequence the distinctively human instantiations of these\nbecome stand-ins for all agency and representation. The result is a form of\ndualism in which humans and nonhumans acquire mixtures of thinglike and\nhumanlike properties (see chapter 1).\n\nLatour (1993, 2004), the main proponent of this approach, for example,\nattributes agency either to that which can be represented or to that which can\nresist our attempts at representation (see also Pickering 1999: 380–81). But\nthese characteristics only capture, what, in Peircean terms would be called\nthe secondness, that is the actuality or brute factuality, of the entity in\nquestion (see chapter 1)—for anything can potentially resist representation or\nbe represented—and this simply reinstates the material/meaning divide STS\ntries to overcome. We still have, on the one hand, the material (now\nagentified), and, on the other, those humans (now made a little more obtuse\nand less certain of their omniscience) who represent or misrepresent things,\nas the case may be.\n\nBut resistance is not agency. Conflating resistance and agency blinds us to\nthe kinds of agency that do in fact exist beyond the human. Because telos,\nrepresentation, intentionality, and selfhood still need to be accounted for\nand because the way such processes emerge and operate beyond the human is not\ntheorized, Latourian science studies is forced to fall back on humanlike forms\nof representation and intentionality as operative in the world beyond the\nhuman. These are then applied, if only metaphorically, to entities otherwise\nunderstood only in their secondness.\n\nSubstances, for example, undergo the “‘sufferings’” of trials (Latour 1987:\n88), and they sometimes emerge successfully as “heroes” (89). The piston of an\nengine is more reliable than a human operator, “since it is, via the cam,\ndirectly interested, so to speak, in the right timing of steam. Certainly it\nis more directly interested than any human being” (130; Latour’s emphasis).\nAnd scientists use “a set of strategies to enlist and interest the human\nactors, and a second set to enlist and interest the non-human actors so as to\nhold the first” (132).\n\nThis approach to nonhuman agency overlooks the fact that some nonhumans,\nnamely, those that are alive, are selves. As selves, they are not just\nrepresented, but they also represent. And they can do so without having to\n“speak.” Nor do they need a “spokesperson” (Latour 2004: 62–70) because, as I\ndiscussed in chapter 1, representation exceeds the symbolic, and it therefore\nexceeds human speech.\n\nAlthough we humans certainly represent nonhuman living beings in a number of\nculturally, historically, and linguistically distinct ways, and this surely\nhas its effects, both for us and for those beings thus represented, we also\nlive in worlds in which how these selves represent us can come to matter\nvitally. Accordingly, my concern is with exploring interactions, not with\nnonhumans generically—that is, treating objects, artifacts, and lives as\nequivalent entities—but with nonhuman living beings in terms of those\ndistinctive characteristics that make them selves.\n\nSelves, not things, qualify as agents. Resistance is not the same as agency.\nNor, contra Bennett (2010), does materiality confer vitality. Selves are the\nproduct of a specific relational dynamic that involves absence, future, and\ngrowth, as well as the ability for confusion. And this emerges with and is\nunique to living thoughts.\n\nANIMISM\n\nI want to return to the anecdote with which I began this book. Recall that\nwhen I was in the forest on a hunting trip I was told to make sure to sleep\nfaceup. This way if a jaguar were to pass by he would see me as a being\ncapable of looking back and would leave me alone. If I were to sleep facedown,\nI was warned, that potential passing jaguar might well treat me as prey and\nattack me. My point was that this anecdote forces us to recognize that how\njaguars see us matters to us, and that if this is so, then anthropology cannot\nlimit itself to asking how people see the world. I noted that by returning the\nfeline’s gaze, we allow jaguars the possibility of treating us as selves. If,\nby contrast, we were to look away, they would treat us as, and we may actually\nbecome, objects—literally, dead meat, aicha.\n\nThe linguist Émile Benveniste (1984) observes that the pronouns I and you\nposition interlocutors intersubjectively through mutual address, and\naccordingly he considers these true “person” pronouns. By contrast, the third\nperson is more accurately a “non-person” (Benveniste 1984: 221). It refers to\nsomething outside of the discursive interaction. If we extend this reasoning\nto trans-species encounters, then jaguars and humans, in this act of looking\nback at each other, would, in a sense, become persons to each other. And in\nthe process, the Runa, in a way, would also become jaguars.\n\nIndeed, as I mentioned in the introduction, the Ávila Runa are renowned—and\nfeared—throughout lowland Runa communities for their ability to become shape-\nshifting were-jaguars. A person who is treated by a jaguar as prey may well\nbecome dead meat. By contrast, one who is treated by a jaguar as a predator\nbecomes another predator. Predator and prey—puma and aicha—are the two kinds\nof beings that jaguars recognize. As with the tick, how jaguars represent\nother beings makes beings into kinds. And what kind of a being one thus\nbecomes matters.\n\nPuma in Quichua simply means “predator.” For example, in Ávila the name for\nthe crab-eating raccoon,[18](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn18) whose diet includes, among\nother things, crustaceans and mollusks, is churu puma, snail predator. Because\nthe jaguar exemplifies the quintessence of predation, it is simply known as\npuma. Runa who survive encounters with such predators are by definition, then,\nruna puma, or were-jaguars (the term Runa is not only an ethnonym; it also\nmeans “person” [see chapter 6]). One survives, then, by not being noticed as\nprey by a puma. But in the process one also becomes another kind of being, a\npuma. And this newfound status translates to other contexts and creates new\npossibilities.\n\nPuma is a relational category—not, in this respect, unlike the pronouns I and\nyou (see chapter 6). That we can become puma by returning a puma’s gaze is a\nway of saying that we both are kinds of Is—that we both are kinds of persons.\nThe Runa, like other Amazonians, treat jaguars and many other nonhuman beings\nas soul-possessing, signifying, intentional selves. They are (to use a\nrecently resuscitated term) animists; for them, nonhumans are animate. They\nare persons.\n\nAnimism, as it is currently being theorized by people like Descola (2005) and\nViveiros de Castro (1998), is quite different from its earlier social\nevolutionist and sometimes even racist incarnations, and it has provided an\nimportant foil for critiquing Western mechanistic representations of nature.\nAnd yet such critiques of the ways we in the “West” represent nature only asks\nhow other humans come to treat nonhumans as animate. In this respect these\napproaches stand in continuity with such classical treatments of animism as\nLévy-Bruhl’s How Natives Think (1926). The case of the jaguar troubles this\nproject; if jaguars also represent us we cannot just ask how it is that some\nof us humans happen to represent them as doing so.\n\nAnimism, to my mind, gets at something more far reaching about the properties\nof the world, and this is why thinking with it is central to an anthropology\nbeyond the human. It captures an animation that is emergent with life, hence\nmy title, How Forests Think. Runa animism grows out of a need to interact with\nsemiotic selves qua selves in all their diversity. It is grounded in an\nontological fact: there exist other kinds of thinking selves beyond the human.\n\nI recognize of course that those we call animists may well attribute animacy\nto all sorts of entities, such as stones, that I would not, according to the\nframework laid out here, consider living selves. If I were building an\nargument from within a particular animistic worldview, if I were routing all\nmy argumentation through what, say, the Runa think, say, or do, this\ndiscrepancy might be a problem. But I don’t. Part of my attempt to open\nanthropology to that which lies beyond the human involves finding ways to make\ngeneral claims about the world. These claims don’t necessarily line up with\ncertain situated human viewpoints, like, say, those of animists, or those of\nbiologists, or those of anthropologists.\n\nHow Forests Think, not How Natives Think, about Forests (cf. Sahlins 1995): if\nwe limit our thinking to thinking through how other people think we will\nalways end up circumscribing ontology by epistemology (chapter 1 suggests a\nsolution to this problem). I am making here a general claim about selfhood.\nThis general claim—which is not exactly an ethnographic one in the sense that\nit is not circumscribed by an ethnographic context, even though it is\nsuggested, explored, and defended, in part, ethnographically—is that living\nbeings are loci of selfhood. I make this claim empirically. It grows out of my\nattention to Runa relations with nonhuman beings as these reveal themselves\nethnographically. These relations amplify certain properties of the world, and\nthis amplification can infect and affect our thinking about the world.\n\nOne might say that the animal person is the model of the universe for\nanimists, whereas for us it is the machine. Ontologically speaking, each has\nits own truth: animals are persons, and there are things about the world that\ndo resemble partible machines (which is a reason why reductionist science is\nso successful). But my goal here is not to say which one is right or to point\nout where each fails but rather to see how certain kinds of engagements, based\non certain presuppositions that themselves grow out of those engagements,\namplify unexpected and real properties of the world that we can harness to\nthink beyond the human as we know it.\n\nRuna animism is pragmatically oriented. The challenge for the Runa, as people\nwho engage intimately with the beings of the forest in order, in large part,\nto eat them, is to find ways to enter this vast ecology of selves to harness\nsome of its plenty. This requires being attuned to the unexpected affinities\nwe share with other selves while at the same time recognizing the differences\nthat distinguish the many kinds of selves that people the forest.\n\nPERSPECTIVISM\n\nLike many Amazonians, people in Ávila approach this through a way of\nunderstanding others that Viveiros de Castro (1998) has described as\n“perspectival.” This stance assumes a fundamental similarity among selves—that\nall kinds of selves are Is. But it also allows for a way to account for the\nunique qualities that characterize different kinds of beings. It involves two\ninterlocking assumptions. First, all sentient beings, be they spirit, animal,\nor human, see themselves as persons. That is, their subjective worldview is\nidentical to the way the Runa see themselves. Second, although all beings see\nthemselves as persons, the ways in which they are seen by other beings depends\non the kinds of beings observing and being observed. For example, people in\nÁvila say that what we perceive as the stench of rotting carrion a vulture\nexperiences as the sweet-smelling vapor emanating from a steaming pot of\nmanioc tubers. Vultures, because of their species-specific habits and\ndispositions, inhabit a different world from that of the Runa. Yet because\ntheir subjective point of view is that of persons, they see this different\nworld in the same way the Runa see their own world (Viveiros de Castro 1998:\n478).[19](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn19)\n\nA tendency to see things perspectivally permeates daily life in\nÁvila.[20](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn20) For instance, a myth that explains why the\nAmazon bamboo rat[21](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn21) has such a loud call relates how\nthis creature once asked a fallen log what women’s genitals look like from its\nvantage point. Since such logs constitute the preferred causeways that women\nuse to traverse their gardens, the rat figured that the log was in a\nprivileged position to know this.[22](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn22) Alluding to the\nrat’s abundant whiskers, the log responded, “Like your mouth.” Hearing this,\nthe rat responded, “Oh stop,”[23](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn23) and then exploded in\nthe bawdy laughter that is now associated with its distinctive loud, long, and\nseemingly uncontrollable staccato call as well as its onomatopoeic name\ngunguta.[24](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn24) The humor in this myth for people in Ávila\nis as much about the sexually explicit reference as it is about the\nperspectival logic.\n\nAnother common form of perspectival joking in Ávila, as well as in other Runa\ncommunities, occurs when two people share the same name. Because I share my\nfirst name with a man in Ávila the running joke was that his wife was married\nto me.[25](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn25) His older sister jokingly addressed me as turi\n(sister’s brother), and I addressed her as pani (brother’s sister). Similarly,\na woman who shares my sister’s middle name called me brother, and one with my\nmother’s name called me son. In all these cases shared names allowed us to\ninhabit a shared perspective. It allowed us to create an affectionate\nrelationship despite the fact that our worlds are so different.\n\nPerspectivism is certainly a historically contingent aesthetic orientation—an\norientation that, pace Viveiros de Castro, we might, in this sense, describe\nas “cultural”—but it is also an ecologically contingent amplificatory effect\nof the need to understand semiotic selves in a way that simultaneously\nrecognizes their continuity with us as well as their differences. It is a\nresponse to the challenges of getting by in an ecology of selves whose\nrelational webs extend well beyond the human, and it emerges from everyday\ninteractions with forest beings.\n\nPeople in Ávila try to make sense of these various selves that inhabit the\nforest by trying to see how they see, and by imagining how different\nperspectives interact. One man took delight in explaining to me how the giant\nanteater adopts the perspective of ants in order to fool them; when the\nanteater sticks its tongue into ant nests, the ants see it as a branch and,\nunsuspecting, climb on. In their interactions with animals, the Runa, in many\nways, try to emulate the anteater. They attempt to capture the perspective of\nanother organism as part of a larger whole. This is what is involved in making\na scarecrow. It is also employed in certain techniques used to catch fish.\nVentura’s father used to paint his hands a dark purple with the crushed fruits\nof shangu, a distant ginger relative,[26](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn26) so that armored\ncatfish[27](Notes.xhtml#ch2fn27) would not notice his attempts to grab them\nfrom underneath the rocks and boulders in the river.\n\nSuch ecological challenges of understanding how the anteater eats ants, or how\nto make a scarecrow that will scare parakeets, or how to fish for catfish\nwithout being recognized by them requires an attentiveness to the points of\nview of other organisms. This attentiveness grows out of the fact that ants,\nparakeets, armored catfish, and indeed all the other life-forms that make up\nthe rain forest, are selves. Who and what they are is, through and through,\nthe product of the ways they represent and interpret the world around them and\nthe ways in which others in that world represent them. They are selves, in\nshort, that have a point of view. This is what makes them animate, and this\nanimation enchants the world.\n\nTHE FEELING OF THINKING\n\nPeople in Ávila take great pleasure in finding a viewpoint that encompasses\nmultiple perspectives. One Ávila myth exquisitely captures this aspect of a\nperspectival aesthetic. It begins with a hero on top of his roof patching it.\nWhen a man-eating jaguar approaches, the hero calls out to him, “Son-in-law,\nhelp me find holes in the thatch by poking a stick through them.” From the\nvantage point of someone inside a house it is quite easy to spot leaks in the\nthatch because of the sunlight that shines through them. However, because\nroofs are so high, it is impossible, from this position, to patch these. A\nperson on the roof, on the other hand, can easily patch the holes but cannot\nsee them. For this reason, when a man is patching his roof he will ask someone\ninside to poke a stick through the holes. This has the effect of aligning\ninside and outside perspectives in a special way; what can only be seen from\nthe inside suddenly becomes visible to the person on the outside who, seeing\nthese two perspectives as part of something greater, can now do something.\nBecause the hero addresses and “sees” the jaguar as son-in-law, the jaguar\nthus hailed feels obligated to fulfill the functions incumbent on this role.\nOnce the jaguar is inside, the hero slams the door shut and the structure\nsuddenly turns into a stone cage that traps him.\n\nA perspectival stance is certainly a practical tool, like the stick used to\nlink inside and outside views, but it also affords something else. It allows\none to linger in that space where, like a shaman, one can be simultaneously\naware of both viewpoints as well as how they are connected by something\ngreater that, like a trap springing shut, suddenly encompasses them. The\nattention people in Ávila give to such moments of awareness is a signature of\nAmazonian multinatural perspectivalism. This is lost when multinatural\nperspectivalism is taken up as a more generic analytic shorn of its\nshamanistic component (see, e.g., Latour 2004).\n\nI propose that this perspectival mythic episode, in which the hero comes to\nunite these divergent perspectives through a vantage that encompasses them,\ncaptures, savors, and makes available something about life “itself.” It\ncaptures something about the logic of the thoughts of the forest. And it\ncaptures the feeling of being alive to this living logic in moments of its\nemergence. It captures, in short, what it feels like to think.\n\nRegarding this experience of coming to see inside and outside perspectives by\nvirtue of something greater that encompasses them, consider Peirce’s\ndiscussion of the experience of learning to move one’s hands simultaneously\nand in opposite directions such that they trace parallel circular paths in the\nair: “To learn to do this, it is necessary to attend, first, to the different\nactions in different parts of the motion, when suddenly a general conception\nof the action springs up and it becomes perfectly easy” (Peirce 1992c: 328).\n\nLike Peirce’s example, the jaguar-trapping myth captures what it feels like\nwhen a self “suddenly” comes to see different perspectives as contributing to\nthe more general whole that unites them. As such it calls to mind what Bateson\n(2002) calls “double description,” which he considers central to life and\nmind. In thinking about double description I draw on—but simplify—Hui,\nCashman, and Deacon’s (2008) analysis of the concept. Bateson illustrates what\nhe means by double description through binocular vision. By recognizing the\nsimilarities and systematically comparing the differences between what each\neye sees, the brain, performing a “double description,” comes to interpret\neach of these inputs as part of something more encompassing at a higher\nlogical level. Something novel emerges: the perception of depth (Bateson 2002:\n64–65).\n\nBateson asks, “What pattern connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to\nthe primrose and all the four of them to me? And me to you? And all the six of\nus to the amoeba in one direction and to the back-ward schizophrenic in\nanother?” (2002: 7). His answer: double description is operative in the form-\ngenerating dynamics that make these entities what they are and how they are\nconnected. The production of a series of roughly similar legs in a “proto-\ncrab” enabled, over evolutionary time, the adaptive differentiation among\nthese legs (some developing into claws, etc.), which allowed the organism as a\nwhole to better “fit” or represent its environment. Just as depth emerges when\nthe brain compares the differential duplication of ocular perspective, a crab\nas an organism with an overall form that fits a given niche (enabling it, for\nexample, to walk sideways on the ocean floor) emerges over evolutionary time\nas an embodied interpretation of the duplication of gradually differing legs.\nBoth involve double descriptions.\n\nThe lobster also emerges as a form that is the embodied product of a double\ndescription involving the differential duplication of appendages. Via\ndifferent genetic mechanisms, the distinctive overall shape of the orchid and\nthe primrose flower (each adapted to its respective pollinators) also results,\nin each case, from a double description involving the differential duplication\nof petals. When we compare crabs and lobsters, and these to the pair of\nplants, as Bateson does, we also perform double descriptions; we recognize the\nsimilarities and systematically compare the differences among these to reveal\nthe double description that is operative in making each kind of organism what\nit is. When we then compare the ways we use double description to arrive at\nthis realization with the way double description operates in the emergence of\nthese biological forms, we see that our form of thinking is of and like the\nbiological world; what is more, double description itself emerges as a\nconceptual object thanks to this higher-order double description.\n\nDeveloping double description from the double description manifest in the\nworld so that double description as a generative modality of mind becomes\napparent gives us, then, the added experience of what it is like to think with\nthe double description that is operative in the world. Or, to put it in the\nterms of this book: thinking with forests allows us to see how we think like\nforests in ways that reveal some of the sylvan properties of the living\nthought itself as well as how we experience these properties.\n\nA shamanistic perspectival aesthetic cultivates and reflects on this process.\nIn the jaguar-trapping myth a higher-order vantage “suddenly . . . springs\nup,” which connects inside and outside perspectives as elements of something\ngreater. This allows the listener to experience the feeling of a new living\nthought as it emerges; it captures what it feels like to think. In Ávila this\nis personified in the figure of the shaman, which is the Amazonian\nquintessence of a self, for all selves, as selves, are considered shamans (see\nViveiros de Castro 1998) and all selves think like forests.\n\nTHE LIVING THOUGHT\n\nLives and thoughts are not distinct kinds of things. How thoughts grow by\nassociation with other thoughts is not categorically different from how selves\nrelate to one another. Selves are signs. Lives are thoughts. Semiosis is\nalive. And the world is thereby animate. People, like the Ávila Runa, who\nenter into and try to harness elements of a complex web of living thoughts are\ninundated by the logic of living thoughts such that their thoughts about life\nalso come to instantiate some of the unique qualities of living thoughts. They\ncome to think with the forest’s thoughts, and, at times, they even experience\nthemselves thinking with the forest’s thoughts in ways that reveal some of the\nsylvan properties of thought itself.\n\nTo recognize living thoughts, and the ecology of selves to which they give\nrise, underscores that there is something unique to life: life thinks; stones\ndon’t. The goal here is not to name some essential vital force, or to create a\nnew dualism to replace those old ones that severed humans from the rest of\nlife and the world. The goal, rather, is to understand some of the special\nproperties of lives and thoughts, which are obscured when we theorize humans\nand nonhumans, and their interactions, in terms of materiality or in terms of\nour assumptions (often hidden) about symbolically based linguistic\nrelationality.\n\nFor Bateson, what makes life unique is that it is characterized by the ways in\nwhich “a difference” can “make a difference” (2000a: 459). Differences in soil\ncan, thanks to layers of living representational relationships, come to make a\ndifference for plants immersed in a complex semiotic ecology. And these\ndifferences can make a difference for other life-forms as well. Semiosis\nclearly involves differences; thoughts and lives grow by capturing differences\nin the world. And getting certain differences right—dogs need to be able to\ndifferentiate between mountain lions and deer—is vital.\n\nBut difference, for the living thought, is not everything. A tick doesn’t\nnotice the differences between a mountain lion and a deer, and this confusion\nis productive. Attending to the ways other kinds of selves inhabit and animate\nthe world encourages us to rethink our ideas of relationality built on\ndifference. The way selves relate is not necessarily akin to the ways in which\nwords relate to each other in that system we call language. Relating is based\nneither on intrinsic difference nor on intrinsic similarity. I have explored\nhere a process prior to what we usually recognize as difference or similarity,\nwhich depends on a form of confusion. Understanding the role that confusion\n(or forgetting, or indifference) plays in the living thought can help us\ndevelop an anthropology beyond the human that can attend to those many\ndynamics central to living and thinking that are not built from quanta of\ndifference.\n\n\n![](images/img_0010.jpg)\n\nTHREE\n\n* * *\n\nSoul Blindness\n\nOut of sleeping a waking,\n\nOut of waking a sleep;\n\nLife death overtaking;\n\nDeep underneath deep?\n\n—Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Sphinx\n\nRamun, the schoolteacher’s ten-year-old brother in-law, pitched his skinny\nmass out of Hilario’s doorframe and called out earnestly, “Pucaña!” By now we\nwere pretty sure that something had gone wrong. Pucaña and Cuqui still hadn’t\ncome home. We didn’t yet know that they had been killed by a feline, but that\nwas what we were starting to suspect. Huiqui had straggled in moments earlier\nwith a gaping hole at the back of her head. Hilario was patiently cleaning her\nwound with some rubbing alcohol from my first-aid kit. Ramun still harbored\nsome hope that Pucaña would turn up. And so he called out her name once more.\nWhen she didn’t appear he turned to us and said, “What’s-its-name. I’m calling\nthe one that’s become shit.” Amériga responded, “She must have become shit.\nThat’s what jaguars do. They just shit them out.”[1](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn1)\n\nAfter retracing our steps to the patchwork of forest and fallows where the\nwomen had been harvesting fish poison and where they had heard the dogs’ last\nbarks, we finally found their bodies. The dogs had indeed been killed, if not\nexactly eaten, by a feline, which the family would later conclude was a jaguar\nand not the mountain lion that the women had originally imagined the dogs had\nmistaken for a deer. Huiqui would not make it through the night.\n\nSelves, like Pucaña, or like us, are ephemeral creatures. They can come to\ninhabit ambiguous spaces—no longer fully interactive subjects that can be\nnamed and that, like Pucaña, can also potentially respond to these names, or\nquite yet transformed into inanimate objects like dead meat, aicha, or jaguar\nshit. Nor, for that matter, can they fully inhabit that final space of\nsilence; chun is the word Luisa used to describe it. Rather, selves can come\nto be caught somewhere in the space between life and death, somewhere in that\nambiguous space of “what’s-its-name” (mashti, in\nQuichua),[2](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn2) of the almost nameless—not exactly here with\nus but not fully elsewhere either.\n\nThis chapter is about the kinds of spaces and transformations, the flip-flops,\nthe difficulties, and the paradoxes captured by the word mashti. It is about\nthe different ways in which selfhood can dissolve and the challenges this\nposes for beings living in an ecology of selves. Such dissolutions come in\nmany forms. There is, of course, the catastrophe of organismic death. But\nthere are also many kinds of disembodiments, and many ways in which selves can\nbecome reduced from a whole to an objectlike part of another self. And,\nfinally, there are ways in which selves can break down as they lose the\nability to perceive and interact with other selves as selves.\n\nThis chapter is also about selves and objects and their co-constitution, and\nit is especially about how selves create objects and how they can also become\nobjects. And it is about the difficulties this fact of life poses for us, as\nwell as what an anthropology beyond the human can learn about such\ndifficulties, thanks to the peculiar ways in which such difficulties become\namplified in this particular ecology of selves of the Ávila region.\n\nAlthough the beginning of life on this earth surely represents, as Jesper\nHoffmeyer (1996: viii) so nicely phrased it, the moment when “something”\nbecame “someone,” that something did not exactly exist before there was a\n“someone.” It is not so much that things didn’t exist before there were beings\nto perceive them but rather that before living thoughts emerged on this earth\nnothing ever came to stand in relationship to a self as an object or as\nanother. Objects, like selves, are also effects of semiosis. And they emerge\nout of semiotic dynamics that exceed the human.\n\nThis chapter, then, is about the various dissolutions of self that living\ncreates. It is about what Stanley Cavell (2005: 128) calls the “little deaths”\nof “everyday life”—the many deaths that pull us out of relation. That death is\nsuch a central part of life exemplifies what Cora Diamond (2008) calls a\n“difficulty of reality.” It is a fundamental contradiction that at times\noverwhelms us humans with its sheer incomprehensibility. And this is\ncompounded by another difficulty: such contradictions are at times, and for\nsome, completely unremarkable. The feeling of disjunction that this lack of\nrecognition creates is also part of the difficulty of reality. Hunting, in\nthis vast ecology of selves, in which one must stand as a self in relation to\nso many other kinds of selves who one then tries to kill, brings such\ndifficulties to the fore; the entire cosmos comes to reverberate with the\ncontradictions intrinsic to life (figure 6).\n\n![](images/img_0011.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6. When dead animals are brought home from the hunt they are fondled\nwith curiosity by children and studiously ignored by adults. Photo by author.\n\nLIFE BEYOND THE SKIN\n\nThe particular configuration of matter and meaning that constitutes a self has\na fleeting existence. Pucaña and the other dogs in some real sense ceased\nbeing selves the moment they were killed by the jaguar. Living selfhood is\nlocalized around such fragile bodies. To say that a self is localized,\nhowever, does not mean that it is necessarily or exclusively inside a body,\n“shut up in a box of flesh and blood,” as Peirce critically put it (CP 7.59;\nsee also CP 4.551), or “bounded by the skin,” in Bateson’s words (2000a: 467).\nLife also extends beyond the confines of one particular embodied locus of\nselfhood. It can potentially exist in some sort of semiotic lineage thanks to\nhow selves are represented by other selves in ways that matter to these\nsubsequent selves.\n\nBeyond individual death there is, then, a kind of life. And the generality of\nlife, its potential to spread into the future, in fact, depends on the spaces\nthat such singular deaths open up (see Silverman 2009: 4). Ventura’s mother,\nRosa, died while I was living in Ávila. But she did not altogether cease\nbeing. According to her son, she entered “inside” (ucuman) the world of the\nspirit masters—the beings who own and protect the animals of the forest (see\nchapters 4–6)—and she married one of them. All that was left of her in the\n“above” world (jahuapi), the world of our everyday experience, was her “skin.”\nAccording to Ventura, his mother “just discarded her\nskin”[3](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn3) when she went to the spirit world, and this skin\nwas what was left for her children to bury at her funeral. Rosa lived on,\noutside her old skin, forever, as a timeless nubile bride in the world of the\nmasters.\n\nWe will all eventually cease being selves. And yet traces of that unique\nconfiguration that constitutes what we take to be our selfhood can potentially\nexceed our mortal skin-bound bodies and in this manner “we” might persist, in\nsome form, well after the end of our “skins.” As I argued in chapter 2, selves\nare outcomes of semiosis. They are embodied loci of interpretant formation—the\nprocess by which one sign is interpreted by another in a way that gives rise\nto a new sign. Selves, then, are signs that can potentially extend into the\nfuture insofar as a subsequent self, with its own embodied locus, re-presents\nit as part of that semiotic process by which that subsequent self emerges as a\nself. Life, then, without ever being fully disembodied, potentially exceeds\nany skin-bound self around which it might currently be localized. Death, as I\nwill argue, is central to the ways a self exceeds its current embodied limits.\n\nSelves exist simultaneously as embodied and beyond the body. They are\nlocalized, and yet they exceed the individual and even the human. One way to\ncapture this way in which selves extend beyond bodies is to say that selves\nhave souls. In Ávila the soul—or alma as people call it, using a term of\nSpanish origin—marks the ways in which semiotic selves are co-constituted in\ninteraction with other such selves. Souls emerge relationally in interaction\nwith other souled selves in ways that blur the boundaries we normally\nrecognize among kinds of beings.\n\nHaving an alma is what makes relation possible in the ecology of selves that\nthe Ávila Runa inhabit. Because, according to people in Ávila, animals are\n“conscious”[4](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn4) of other kinds of beings, they have souls.\nFor example, both the dog and the agouti, a large, edible forest rodent that,\nalong with the peccary, is considered quintessential game (aicha in Quichua),\npossess souls because of their abilities to “become aware\nof,”[5](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn5) to notice, those beings that stand in relation to\nthem as predator or prey. The agouti is able to detect the presence of its\npredator the dog, and therefore it has a soul. This relational capacity is\nreified; it has a physical location in the body. The agouti’s gall bladder and\nsternum serve as its organs of consciousness. Through these, the agouti\ndetects the presence of predators. People’s awareness of other beings is also\nsomatically localized. Muscular twitches, for instance, alert them to the\npresence of visitors or dangerous animals such as poisonous snakes.\n\nBecause the soul, as relational quality, is located in specific parts of the\nbody, it can pass to others when these parts are eaten. Dogs are defined as\nconscious, soul-possessing beings because of their ability to detect agoutis\nand other game. They can increase their consciousness—as measured by their\nincreased ability to detect prey—by ingesting the very organs that permit the\nagouti to detect the presence of dogs. For this reason people in Ávila\nsometimes feed the agouti’s bile or sternum to their dogs.\n\nFollowing the same logic, they also increase their consciousness of other\nbeings by ingesting animal body parts. Because bezoar stones, the indigestible\naccretions sometimes found in deer stomachs, are considered the source of\ndeer’s awareness of predators, hunters sometimes smoke their scrapings in\norder to encounter deer more readily. Some people in Ávila become runa puma by\ndrinking jaguar bile; this helps them adopt a predatory point of view, and it\nfacilitates the passage of their souls into the bodies of jaguars when they\ndie.\n\nLike people in Ávila, Peirce saw the soul as a marker of communication and\ncommunion among selves. He saw the soul as capturing certain general\nproperties inherent to a living semiotic self in constitutive interaction with\nother such selves.[6](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn6) Accordingly, Peirce locates the\n“seat of the soul,” not necessarily in a body, even though it is always\nrelated to a body, but as an effect of intersubjective semiotic interpretance:\n“When I communicate my thought and my sentiments to a friend with whom I am in\nfull sympathy, so that my feelings pass into him and I am conscious of what he\nfeels, do I not live in his brain as well as in my own—most literally?” (CP\n7.591). The soul, according to Peirce, is not a thing, with a unitary\nlocalized existence, but something more like a word, in that its multiple\ninstantiations can exist simultaneously in different places.\n\nLiving thoughts extend beyond bodies. But this fact poses its own problems.\nJust how do selves extend beyond the limits of the bodies that house them? And\nwhere and when do such selves finally come to an end? How life extends beyond\nbodies in such a way that somehow entangles selfhood with the fact of finitude\nis a general problem. It is a problem inherent to life, and it is one that\nthis ecology of selves amplifies in ways that might allow an anthropology\nbeyond the human to learn something about the way that death is intrinsic to\nlife.\n\nIn Ávila this problem becomes particularly salient in the interactions people\nhave with runa puma. Were-jaguars are ambiguous creatures. On the one hand,\nthey are others—beasts, demons, animals, or enemies—but, on the other, they\nare persons who retain powerful emotional connections and a sense of\nobligation to their living relatives.\n\nThis ambiguous position poses serious challenges. Ventura’s recently deceased\nfather’s puma killed one of his son’s chickens. This angered Ventura and made\nhim doubt whether his father, now a jaguar, still continued to consider him a\nson. Accordingly, Ventura went out to the woods near his house and spoke out\nloud to his father, who was around there, somewhere, inhabiting the body, and\nthe viewpoint, of a jaguar:\n\n> “I’m not an other,” I told him.\n>\n> “I’m your son.”\n>\n> “Even when I’m away,\n>\n> you need to look after my chickens.”[7](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn7)\n\nHe continued to criticize his father for not acting more like a real puma who,\ninstead of snatching chickens, should be out in the deep forests hunting for\nhimself: “‘Is that what you’re gonna do instead of going off to the\nmountains?’” “‘If you’re gonna stick around here,’” Ventura continued, “‘you\nneed . . . to catch at least something for me.’” Shortly after—“It wasn’t\nlong—I think it was only about three days”—Ventura’s father’s puma finally\nbegan to fulfill his obligations: “Just like that, he gave me a nice agouti he\ncaught.”\n\nThis is how Ventura came upon the “gift” from his father. He first discovered\nthe kill site in some brush near his house. He observed that the jaguar had\n“trampled” a clearing “until it was shiny.” From this shiny clearing Ventura\nfollowed the trail made by the jaguar pulling the carcass through the brush.\n\n> And then I saw\n>\n> this,\n>\n> this here head, just a head cut off.\n>\n> . . .\n>\n> After that, I looked around and noticed a string of entrails\n>\n> . . .\n>\n> And then the puma dragged it even further\n\nVentura, gesturing with his hands, described the quarry he finally came upon.\n\n> The whole thing, from here on up was eaten.\n>\n> But both legs were still good.\n\nNot only did his father’s puma leave the prime cuts for his son, but he also\nwrapped them, just like the gifts of smoked meat presented to invited kin at a\nwedding.\n\n> Covering it with leaves.\n>\n> Wrapping it up inside them,\n>\n> he just left it.\n\nThe puma’s gift is a half-eaten, disemboweled agouti carcass—a body no longer\nrecognizable as a self but now transformed into cuts of packaged meat.\n\nWere-jaguars are ambiguous creatures. One is never sure if they really are\nstill human. Will they forget to fulfill the duties of a relation? And when\nthey are encountered in the forest in all their ferocious otherness might they\nnot also simultaneously be the kind of person to whom we owe obligations?\n\nOne day out hunting, Juanicu happened upon a jaguar. He shot at it with his\nsmall muzzle-loading shotgun, a gun that is not very effective against large\nfelines. This is how, with nothing more than a cascading chain of iconic sound\nimages, he re-created the event:\n\n> tya\n>\n> (a gun firing successfully)\n>\n> tsi’o—\n>\n> (the vocalization made by the jaguar as it was hit)\n>\n> tey’e—\n>\n> (the ammunition hitting its target)\n>\n> hou’u—h\n>\n> (another vocalization made by the jaguar)\n\nThen, rapidly and somewhat more softly, Juanicu imitated the sound made by the\nlead shot hitting the jaguar’s teeth:\n\n> tey tey tey tey\n\nThe shot shattered the jaguar’s teeth and severed some of his whiskers. After\nthe jaguar ran off, Juanicu picked up some of the whiskers that had been\nblasted off, shoved them—“huo’”—into his pocket, packed up the jaguar’s half-\neaten quarry, and went home.\n\nThat evening, the jaguar was still with him. “He made me dream,” Juanicu told\nme, “all night long.” In those dreams Juanicu’s long-dead compadre came to him\nand appeared just like he had when he was still alive, except that when he\nopened his mouth to talk his shattered teeth were visible: “‘How is it that\nyou can do such a thing to a compadre?’” he asked Juanicu. “‘Now what am I\ngonna eat with?’” Juanicu’s compadre then paused and panted, “‘hha–,’” the way\njaguar’s do, and then he continued, “‘Like this, I won’t be able to eat. Like\nthis I’m gonna die.’” “And that,” Juanicu concluded, “is how he told me what\nhappened . . . that’s how the soul tells you at night when you dream.” After a\nlong pause, Juanicu added, “I shot that. I sent that\noff.”[8](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn8)\n\nThe runa puma is a strange creature; he reveals himself as a compadre and yet\npants like a jaguar. Juanicu is bound to him through ritual kin ties, and yet\nhe has no remorse about shooting it. The runa puma who spoke to Juanicu is a\nself; the selfsame one he shot is a thing.[9](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn9)\n\nThis contradictory nature of the puma also came up in the conversations\nHilario and his family had about the identity of the jaguar that killed their\ndogs. Several hours after Ramun called out to Pucaña, the family found her\nbody out in the forest strewn beside Cuqui’s and concluded, from the tracks in\nthe area and the bite marks to the backs of their heads, that it had been a\njaguar that had killed them.\n\nBut they still didn’t know what kind of jaguar was responsible. They suspected\nit was a runa puma and not just a regular “forest jaguar” (sacha puma), but\nthis, in and of itself, was not a fully satisfying answer. As one family\nmember put it, “Whose puma would bother us like this?” That night they got\ntheir response. Everyone dreamed of Hilario’s dead father. Amériga dreamed\nthat her father-in-law came up to her wearing a hat and asked her to store a\nlarge package of game meat he had been given. Luisa dreamed that she could see\nher father’s testicles and that his intestines were coming out of his anus.\nLater that evening she dreamed of two calves, one black and one mottled,\nwhich, she reasoned, must belong to her father, now himself a master in the\nafterlife realm of the spirit masters of the forest (see chapter 6).\n\nHilario’s son Lucio was away from home. He had not heard news of the attack\nfrom his family and didn’t return until the day after it happened. But he too\nhad dreamed that night of his grandfather, “right there just talking and\nlaughing with me.” This, for him, secured the jaguar’s identity: “So it must\nhave been my dead grandpa—so it must have been him wandering around.” It must\nhave been, that is, his grandfather’s soul, in a jaguar’s body, wandering the\nthickets near the house, seeing the world through jaguar eyes, seeing the\nfamily’s dogs as prey.\n\nLucio didn’t dream of a fierce jaguar but of a loving grandfather. He and his\ngrandfather were together, talking and laughing.[10](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn10)\nLaughter, like crying and yawning, is contagious. It provokes laughter in\nothers and, in this way, unites them, through a kind of iconism, as one in a\nshared sentiment (see Deacon 1997: 428–29). It unites them, in Peirce’s words,\nin a “continuity of reaction” (CP 3.613). As they laughed together Lucio and\nhis grandfather, for a moment, formed a single self in communicative\ncommunion.\n\nBut as far as Hilario and his family could tell this jaguar—the beloved\ngrandfather—attacked the dogs for no good reason. Some runa puma attack dogs\nwhen their relatives don’t observe the taboos that are prescribed after the\ndeath of a relative. This was not the case here. And this made the attack\nincomprehensible. For Lucio, this were-jaguar was “no good.” For Hilario, he\nwas “a demon,” a “supai.” “What else,” he asked, “could it be?” “Yeah,” Luisa\nelaborated, “transformed into a demon.” Amériga, always questioning, always\nwanting to know why, asked no one in particular, “How is it that, being a\nperson, he could turn into such a creature?” Souls, as Amériga intimated, are\npersons, like us, and they interact that way with us in dreams. Yet as jaguars\nin the forest, they might become an other kind of being—a kind of being no\nlonger capable of sharing or caring, a kind of being that is less than dead,\none that is soulless, a nonperson.\n\nLucio’s dream-time contact with his beloved grandfather and the presence of\nthat demonic jaguar in the forest are one and the same. “The reason I dreamed\nlike that,” Lucio reflected, “was that he must have come down for a visit.”\nAmériga agreed. Were-jaguars are supposed to be up in the mountains, far from\nwhere people live. It was because Lucio’s grandfather had come down from his\nforest abode that his soul and that of his grandson could come together in\nlaughter the night that Lucio dreamed. This also, in a way, explained the\nattack on the dogs.\n\nLater that evening at his parents’ house, Lucio recalled a recent encounter in\nthe forest with a jaguar, and given the circumstances and his dream he came to\nthe conclusion that this too was a manifestation of his grandfather. Lucio\nwanted to kill this puma. In his recollection he makes it “killable” (Haraway\n2008: 80) by describing it as a thing, not a person. He used the inanimate\npronoun chai (that), in its abbreviated form chi, instead of the animate pai,\nwhich in Quichua would be used to mark the third person regardless of gender\nor status as human:\n\n> chillatami carca\n>\n> that’s the one!\n\nAnd he was angry that his gun malfunctioned and he missed a shot: “Damn!”\n\nLucio didn’t regret having tried to kill this jaguar, even after learning that\nit harbored his grandfather’s soul. His grandfather, who, in Lucio’s dream,\nwas more than a third person—was in fact a kind of we, united with Lucio in\nlaughter—became for him a mere thing.\n\nFINALIZING DEATH\n\nThe boundaries between life and death are never perfectly clear. There are\nmoments, however, when they need to be made so. When a person dies, his or her\nsoul—or souls, for these, like Peirce’s, can be multiple and can exist\nsimultaneously in different places—leaves the body. As with Lucio’s\ngrandfather’s soul, it can enter the body of a jaguar, or it can “climb up”\n(sican) to the Christian heaven, or it can become a master in the realm of the\nspirit masters of the animals.\n\nWhat is left is the aya. Aya in Ávila Quichua means two things. In one sense\nit simply means the inanimate corpse, the bag of skin that Rosa left behind\nfor Ventura and her other children to bury. In another sense it refers to the\nwandering ghost of the dead, bereft of both body and soul. The soul imputes\nconsciousness and the attendant ability to resonate and empathize with other\nbeings. The fact that the aya has no soul makes it particularly damaging to\npeople. It becomes “shican,” that is, “another kind”[11](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn11)\nof being—one that is “no longer capable of loving people,” as one person\nexplained it to me.[12](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn12) This is especially true of the\nrelation it has to its family. It no longer recognizes relatives as loved\nones. The aya are doubly estranged from babies born after their deaths, for\ntheir relation to them is even more tenuous. These babies are therefore quite\nsusceptible to illnesses caused by them. Although the aya lack consciousness\nand a soul, they wander the places they used to frequent when alive, trying\nhopelessly to reattach themselves to the world of the living. By doing this,\nthey cause sickness to their family through a kind of “mal aire” known as\nhuairasca.\n\nThe aya inhabit a confused space. We know they are dead, but they think they\nare still alive. Accordingly, two to three weeks after a person dies and is\nburied, a ritual feast, known as aya pichca,[13](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn13) is held\nin order to rid the living of the dangers of the aya still in their presence\nand in this way to definitively separate the realm of living selves from that\nof the lifeless. This ritual begins in the early evening and lasts well into\nthe next morning. This is followed by a special meal (see chapter 4). Such an\naya pichca was held after Jorge, Rosa’s husband and the father of Ventura,\nAngelicia, and Camilo, died. The first part began in the early evening and\nlasted the entire night, until just before dawn. It consisted of a drinking\nparty in Jorge’s abandoned house.\n\nAlthough there was some crying and some of the distinctive chantlike wailing\nthat often accompanies mourning in Ávila, the mood for the most part was\njoyous. In fact, Jorge was treated as if he were still alive. When Jorge’s\ndaughter Angelicia arrived at his house, she left beside the bed he once slept\non a bottle of the home brew vinillu, saying, “Here, drink this sweet\nwater.”[14](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn14) Others would later serve him bowls of fish\nsoup. When a neighbor placed a bottle of vinillu on the bench, another fell\noff. This prompted someone to remark that Jorge, now a little drunk, was\nknocking over bottles. As we were about to go to Camilo’s house nearby,\nAngelicia’s husband, Sebastián, said, “OK, Grandpa, you just wait, we’ll be\nback in a bit.”[15](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn15)\n\nDespite the ways in which people treated Jorge as if he were still part of an\nintimate social circle of the living—joking with him, talking to him, sharing\nfood and drink with him, taking temporary leave and then returning to immerse\nhim in a final all-night party—the purpose of this ritual was actually to send\nJorge’s aya off, definitively and forever, to reunite with his afterbirth\n(pupu) buried back near the Huataracu River, where his parents lived at the\ntime of his birth.[16](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn16) Only when that empty remnant of\nself, marked by the aya, is realigned with the placental trace marking Jorge’s\nemergence as a unique embodied locus of self, will his ghost cease its\ndangerous wanderings.\n\nWe stayed up all night, drinking and joking beside Jorge’s bed. As daylight\napproached, a time when Jorge would have normally gone off hunting, the mood\nchanged. Someone came around and painted our faces with achiote. A dab of this\nreddish orange face paint served as a kind of cloak that made our nature as\nhuman selves invisible to Jorge’s aya. No longer able to see us as persons, he\nwould be unaware of our presence, and, in this manner, he would not be\ndetoured from his resting place.\n\nThis is how it must be. The aya are extremely dangerous to the living, and\nunmediated intersubjective encounters with them, such as seeing or speaking\nwith them, can cause death. For such encounters require seeing the world from\nthe point of view of these nonliving, nonselves. And this, in turn, would\nimply the radical dissolution of our selfhood—something we would not be able\nto survive.\n\nOur faces now painted with achiote, we took basketfuls of Jorge’s possessions\noutside and placed them on a path that Jorge’s aya would walk to reunite with\nhis afterbirth. Children were notably present, and they were encouraged to\ntalk to Jorge as if he were alive, urging him to go on his way with phrases\nlike “Come on, let’s go.” Meanwhile, Jorge’s close relatives got off the trail\nand hid in the forest. In this manner the aya, now unable to recognize his\nfamily, friends, and neighbors, was fanned along on its way with the leaves of\naya chini, a giant anomalously nonstinging variety of\nnettle.[17](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn17) Some felt a breeze as Jorge’s aya departed.\nHis hens, placed in one of his carrying baskets, became frightened, indicating\nthe presence of the departing aya.\n\nAt the beginning of the evening Jorge, although dead, was still a person to\nhis living relations, someone with whom his relatives that night ate and drank\nand laughed and talked. By the end of the evening, however, Jorge had become\nexcluded from that realm of commensality. He was sent forever to the separate\nsocial and relational domain of the deceased.\n\nDISTRIBUTED SELFHOOD\n\nDesubjectivization is not only caused by the physical dissolution of the\nembodied locus of selfhood in death. There are also important ways in which\nselves that are still living cease being treated as selves by other selves.\nAlthough people in Ávila recognize dogs as selves in their own right, they\nalso, on occasion, treat them as tools. They sometimes compare dogs to guns,\nthe implication being that like these “arms” dogs are extensions of human\nhunting abilities. People in Ávila are careful to observe special precautions\nregarding the implements that help them hunt. For example, they make sure that\nany bones from animals they have killed are disposed of in the nearby washing\nand drinking streams, lest the gun or trap used to kill these animals become\n“ruined” (huaglirisca).\n\nDogs are also subject to such potential defilement. Hilario’s family was\ncareful not to feed the dogs the large bones of the deer they had killed that\nweek before they were attacked. The bones were instead properly discarded in\nthe stream. In this case, because the dogs—rather than a gun or trap—had\nkilled the deer, they might also become “ruined.” Their noses, Hilario\nremarked, “would become stopped up,”[18](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn18) and they would\nno longer be able to be aware of the game animals in the forest. Dogs, then,\nin certain contexts are like guns. They become extensions—arms—that expand the\nlocus of human selfhood.\n\nPeople can also become thinglike tools. They can become parts of a greater\nwhole, appendages of a larger self. At a drinking party, Narcisa, in her early\ntwenties, told us of an encounter she had had the day before with a doe, a\nbuck, and their fawn in the woods near her house. Deer are coveted game\nanimals, and Narcisa was hoping to kill one. But there were a couple of\nproblems. First, women don’t usually carry guns, and she regretted that she\nwas unarmed. “Damn!” she exclaimed, “If I had that thing”—that is, a\nshotgun—“it would’ve been great!”[19](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn19) Second, her\nhusband, who did have his gun handy and was in the vicinity, hadn’t seen the\ndeer. Fortunately, however, the night before Narcisa had, as she put it,\n“dreamed well.” And this led her to think that they would be able to get one\nof those deer.\n\nNarcisa was faced with the challenge of trying to alert her husband to the\npresence of deer without at the same time alerting the deer to her own\npresence. She attempted to “yell” forcefully but at the same time quietly by\nsubstituting an increase in volume with an increase in word elongation:\n\n> “‘Aleja—ndru,’ I quietly cried out.”\n\nThe tension in her throat absorbed the volume of the sound without decreasing\nthe urgency of her message. She was hoping, in this way to remain inaudible to\nthe deer. But her attempt failed:\n\n> after calling like that\n>\n> the doe noticed\n>\n> and slo–wly, turned around [about to run off]\n\nMore accurately, Narcisa’s attempt to keep the deer from noticing her only\npartially failed. The buck, as opposed to the doe, “never noticed anything.”\n\nNarcisa’s challenge concerning how to selectively communicate to her husband\nabout the deer without the deer noticing points to the ways in which agency\nbecomes distributed over different selves and how some of these selves can\nlose agency in the process. Narcisa is the primary agent here. Dreaming is a\nprivileged form of experience and knowledge, and it was she, not her husband,\nwho had dreamed. Narcisa’s “good dreaming” was the important action. Her\nhusband’s ability to shoot the animal was simply a proximate extension of\nthis.\n\nNarcisa’s agency is the locus of cause—it is her dream that counted—and yet\nher intentions can only be successfully realized by extending herself through\nobjects. Without a gun, she can’t shoot a deer, and because men generally are\nthe ones who carry guns in Ávila, she must involve her husband. In this\ncontext, however, he is not really a person but rather, like a gun, he becomes\nan object, a tool, a part through which Narcisa can extend herself.\n\nThe distribution of selves and objects in this situation should, Narcisa\nhoped, have looked as follows: Narcisa and Alejandro should have been united\nas a single individual in a “continuity of reaction,” oriented, together, as\npredator toward the killing of a deer, here thought of as a prey object.\nNarcisa and Alejandro, in other words, should have become an emergent single\nself, whereby two selves become one by virtue of their shared reaction to the\nworld around them (see Peirce CP 3.613). For such a “continuity of being” (CP\n7.572), as Peirce has it, creates “a sort of loosely compacted person, in some\nrespects of higher rank than the person of an individual organism” (CP 5.421).\nThis emergent self need not have been equally distributed. Narcisa would have\nbeen the locus of this agency, and Alejandro, like Hilario’s dog, would have\nbecome an arm—an object through which Narcisa extended her agency.\n\nBut things did not turn out this way. The continuity of reaction oriented\nitself, not along species lines, but along gender ones, and these crossed\nspecies boundaries in ways that disturbed the particular predator/prey\ndistribution that Narcisa had hoped for. The doe noticed Narcisa. Neither the\nbuck nor the husband ever noticed anything. This is not the way Narcisa wanted\nthings to turn out. Narcisa and the doe here were the sentient selves, united,\ninconveniently, it turned out, through a continuity of being as a higher-order\nsingle self. In “never noticing anything,” the males had become objects.\n\nSEEING BEYOND ONESELF\n\nAlejandro and the buck remained unaware of those other selves in their\npresence. This is dangerous. If trans-species interactions depend on the\ncapacity to recognize the selfhood of other beings, losing this capacity can\nbe disastrous for beings, such as these two males, who are caught up in the\nwebs of predation that structure this forest ecology of selves. Under certain\ncircumstances we are all forced to recognize the other kinds of minds,\npersons, or selves that inhabit the cosmos. In this particular ecology of\nselves that entangles Alejandro and the buck, selves must recognize the soul-\nstuff of other selves in order to interact with them.\n\nThat is, in this ecology of selves, to remain selves, all selves must\nrecognize the soul-stuff of the other souled selves that inhabit the cosmos.\nI’ve chosen the term soul blindness to describe the various debilitating forms\nof soul loss that result in an inability to be aware of and relate to other\nsoul-possessing selves in this ecology of selves. I adopt the term from Cavell\n(2008: 93), who uses it to imagine situations in which one might fail to see\nothers as humans.[20](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn20) Because in this ecology of selves\nall selves have souls, soul blindness is not just a human problem; it is a\ncosmic one.\n\nSoul blindness, in this Ávila ecology of selves, is marked by an isolating\nstate of monadic solipsism—an inability to see beyond oneself or one’s kind.\nIt arises when beings of any sort lose the ability to recognize the\nselfhood—the soul-stuff—of those other beings that inhabit the cosmos and it\nemerges in a number of domains. I enumerate a few examples here to give a\nsense of the range and prevalence of this phenomenon. For instance, something\nknown as the hunting soul[21](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn21) allows hunters to be aware\nof prey in the forest. Shamans can steal this soul with the effect that the\nvictim can no longer detect animals. Without this soul, hunters become “soul\nblind.” They lose their ability to treat prey-beings as selves and can\ntherefore no longer differentiate animals from the environments in which they\nlive.\n\nHunting is also made easier by the soul loss of prey. Men who kill the souls\nof animals in their dreams can easily hunt them the next day because these\nanimals, now soulless, have become soul blind. They are no longer able to\ndetect their human predators.\n\nShamans do not only potentially steal the souls of hunters, they can also\nsteal the souls of the vision-producing aya huasca plants of their shamanic\nrivals with the effect that these plants become soul blind; ingesting them no\nlonger permits privileged awareness of the actions of other souls.\n\nThe invisible darts through which the shaman attacks his victims are propelled\nby his soul-containing life breath (samai). When darts lose this breath they\nbecome soul blind; they are no longer directed at a specific self but travel\naimlessly, without intention, causing harm to anyone that happens upon their\npath. Jorge’s aya was soul blind in a manner very similar to the shaman’s\nspent darts, it lacked the ability to engage in normative social relationships\nwith its living relatives, and was therefore seen as dangerous.\n\nAdults sometimes punish children by pulling at tufts of their hair until a\nsnapping sound is made. These children become temporarily soul blind; they\nbecome dazed and unable to interact with others.\n\nThe crown of the head, especially the fontanel,[22](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn22) is an\nimportant portal for the passage of life breath and soul-stuff. Soul blindness\ncan also be effected by extracting life breath through the fontanel. Delia\ndescribed the jaguar that killed the dogs as having “bit them with a ta’ on\ntheir animal-following crowns.”[23](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn23) Ta’ is an iconic\nadverb, a sound image, that describes “the moment of contact between two\nsurfaces, one of which, typically, is manipulated by a force higher in agency\nthan the other” (Nuckolls 1996: 178). This precisely captures the way in which\nthe jaguar’s canines impacted and then penetrated the dogs’ skulls. That\npeople in Ávila consider such a bite lethal has much to do with the ways in\nwhich this part of the body permits intersubjectivity. The dogs’ deaths, then,\nwere the result of a complete loss of their “animal-following”\ncapabilities—the radical and instantaneous imposition of soul blindness.\n\nSome notion of the motivations of others is necessary for people to get by in\na world inhabited by volitional beings. Our lives depend on our abilities to\nbelieve in and act on the provisional guesses we make about the motivations of\nother selves.[24](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn24) It would be impossible for people in\nÁvila to hunt or to relate in any other way within this ecology of selves\nwithout treating the myriad beings that inhabit the forest as the animate\ncreatures that they are. Losing this ability would sever the Runa from this\nweb of relations.\n\nPREDATION\n\nHunting within an ecology of selves is tricky business. On the one hand, the\nsharing of food and drink, and especially of meat, is, throughout Amazonia,\ncrucial to the creation of the kinds of interpersonal relations that are the\nbasis for community. Growing children should have plenty of meat, and their\ngrandparents and godparents should also receive regular gifts of meat.\nRelatives, compadres, and neighbors who come to help clear forest and build\nhouses also need to be fed meat. Sharing meat is central to the fruition of\nsocial ties in Ávila. And yet that meat that is shared and consumed was also,\nat one point, a person. Once one recognizes the personhood of animals, there\nis always the danger of confusing hunting with warfare and commensality with\ncannibalism.[25](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn25)\n\nTo notice and to relate to the various beings that live in this ecology of\nselves, these various beings must be recognized as persons. But to eat them as\nfood, they must eventually become objects, dead meat. If the selves that are\nhunted are persons, then might not people too eventually become dehumanized\nobjects of predation? Jaguars do, in fact, sometimes attack hunters in the\nforest. And sorcerers can assume the appearance of predatory raptors. This is\nwhy, as Ventura noted, one should never try to kill an agouti that runs into\nthe house, for it is surely a relative, transformed into the fleeing prey of a\npredatory sorcerer that has taken the form of a raptor. Predation points to\nthe difficulties involved when selves become objects or treat other selves as\nobjects within an ecology of selves.\n\nAs I mentioned, at times people consume animals, not as meat, but as selves,\nto acquire some of their selfhood. Men drink jaguar bile to become puma, and\nthey feed agouti sternums and other soul-containing body parts to their\nhunting dogs. These substances are consumed raw to preserve the selfhood of\nthe creature being eaten. This, as Carlos Fausto (2007) has noted, amounts to\na kind of cannibalism. By contrast, when people want to eat commensally, that\nis, when the communion is not with the eaten but among the eaters, then the\neaten must be transformed into an object. Processes of desubjectivization,\nsuch as cooking, are central to this, and the Ávila Runa in this regard are\nlike so many other Amazonians in thoroughly boiling their meat and avoiding\ncooking processes such as roasting that can leave some of the meat raw (Lévi-\nStrauss 1969).\n\nAn ecology of selves is a relational pronominal system; who counts as an I or\na you and who becomes an it is relative and can\nshift.[26](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn26) Who is predator and who is prey is\ncontextually dependent, and people in Ávila take great relish in noting how\nthese relationships can sometimes become reversed. For example, a jaguar\ntrying to attack a large land turtle (yahuati) is said to have gotten its\ncanines caught in the turtle’s carapace and was forced to abandon not only his\nprey but also his teeth that had broken off and remained lodged in the\nturtle’s shell. Now toothless, the jaguar was unable to hunt and soon began to\nstarve. When the jaguar finally expired, the turtle, that great lover of\ncarrion, with the jaguar’s canines still impaled in its shell, began to eat\nthe rotting flesh of its former predator. The jaguar was thus transformed into\nits former prey’s prey. This quintessential I is only so by virtue of the\nrelationship it has to an it—to aicha, or prey. When this relationship\nchanges, when the turtle becomes a puma, the jaguar is no longer the predator.\nJaguars are not always jaguars; sometimes turtles are the real jaguars. What\nkind of being one comes to be is the product of how one sees as well as how\none is seen by other kinds of beings.\n\nBecause trans-species relationality is so overwhelmingly predatory in this\ncosmic ecology of selves, those creatures that don’t neatly fit are especially\ninteresting. One class of beings that receives such attention is the mammalian\norder Xenathera, which includes such seemingly disparate creatures as sloths,\nanteaters, and armadillos. Another name for this order in the Linnean system\nis Edentata. Appropriately, this means “rendered toothless” in Latin, and it\nalludes to one of the most striking features that makes this group a kind,\nboth for biologists and for people in Ávila: its members lack “true” teeth;\nthey develop no milk teeth and lack canines, incisors, and premolars. Members\nof this order have only peglike teeth, if they have any at all (Emmons 1990:\n31).\n\nTeeth are central markers of predator status. Hilario once told us of an\nenormous jaguar that people in Ávila managed to kill many years ago. The\ncanine teeth were the size of small bananas, and, according to him, the\nvillage women, imagining how many people those teeth must have killed, wept\nwhen they saw them. Because canines embody the essence of a predatory nature,\npeople use jaguar canines to put hot pepper in the eyes of children so that\nthey too will be pumas. Without their canines, jaguars are no longer pumas.\nJaguars, people say, die when their teeth wear out.\n\nIt is in this context that the members of the “toothless” order are so\nsalient. Legend has it that the collared anteater (susu) is prone to fighting\nwith the sloth (indillama), saying, “You have teeth and still you have thin\narms. If I had teeth I would be even fatter than I already am.” Sloths have\nvestigial peglike teeth; the arboreal collared anteater, like its larger\nterrestrial cousin the giant anteater, or tamanuhua, completely lacks teeth.\nDespite their lack of teeth, anteaters are formidable predators. An arboreal\nanteater can easily kill a dog, and it is indefatigable. It is known to\nwithstand many shots before it falls to the ground, and once on the ground a\nhunter will often have to pound on its head with a stick to kill it. The giant\nanteater is considered a puma in its own right. Though it lacks teeth, its\nsharp claws can be lethal. Juanicu was almost killed by one while I was living\nin Ávila (see chapter 6). Even the jaguar is said to be afraid of the giant\nanteater. According to Ventura, when a jaguar encounters a giant anteater\nsleeping between the buttresses of a tree he will signal for all to be quiet,\nsaying, “‘Sshh, don’t tap [the buttress], big brother-in-law’s\nsleeping.’”[27](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn27)\n\nBecause armadillos lack true teeth they also don’t easily fit into the\npredator/prey ecological cycle of self-perpetuation through object creation.\nIn contrast to the anteaters, armadillos are not at all aggressive, and by no\nmeans can they be construed as threatening predators. This is how Emmons\n(1990: 39) describes their innocuous nature: “[They] trot with a rolling or\nscuttling gait, some like windup toys, snuffling and grubbing with their noses\nand forepaws and seemingly unaware of anything more than a foot or two away.”\n\nArmadillos have their own kind of spirit master, the armallu curaga, or Lord\nof the Armadillos, who owns and protects them. Appropriately, the entry to\nthis lord’s home is a tunnel, like that of an armadillo’s burrow. Legend has\nit that an Ávila man got lost in the forest and was eventually found by this\nmaster, who then invited him home to share a meal. When the food was brought\nout the man saw piles of freshly cooked, steaming-hot armadillo meat. The\nmaster, by contrast, saw this same food as cooked squash. Like a squash, the\narmadillo has a hard “rind.” What from our vantage appears as this animal’s\nintestines, the master sees as a tangled mass of seeds enveloped by the\nfibrous and sticky flesh at the heart of a squash.\n\nLike his armadillos, the lord had no teeth and, to the man’s surprise,\nproceeded to “eat” the food before him by simply inhaling through his nose the\nvapor that emanated from the cooked servings. When he was finished, the food\nstill looked to the man like perfectly good, intact cuts of meat. But the\narmadillo master, having already consumed all their life force, considered\nthese cuts excrement and, to the man’s dismay, discarded them.\n\nThe spirit masters of the forest, such as the armallu curaga, are predatory,\nlike jaguars, and they are sometimes considered demonic. However, instead of\neating meat and blood as jaguars and other demons do, the Lord of the\nArmadillos “eats” only life breath because it lacks the teeth that are the\nmarkers of a “true” predator. Unlike the jaguar through whose body Ramun\nimagined Pucaña being transmuted into shit, this strange predator lacks the\nteeth to eat meat. Therefore he doesn’t shit real shit, and that process of\ndesubjectivization is never completed. What excrement this master does\nproduce, he smears on himself as face paint.\n\nThe master keeps his armadillos in his garden, and, as one does with squashes,\nhe taps on them to determine if they are “ripe” and ready to eat. The Lord of\nthe Armadillos was kind to the lost man and invited him to take one of these\n“squashes” home. But every time the man tried to grab one it would scuttle\noff—vine, leaves, and all.\n\nPeople on occasion attempt to harness the fact that such predator-prey\nrelationships are potentially reversible. Men sometimes do so by means of\ncharms (pusanga), which they employ to attract and seduce animals, and\nsometimes women. When men use these, they want to disguise their intentions.\nIt is fitting, then, that the most important of these charms is made from the\nanaconda’s skull and teeth. The anaconda, along with the jaguar, is a feared\npredator. But unlike the jaguar, the anaconda captures its prey by a process\nof attraction and seduction. It causes animals and people alike to become lost\nin the forest. The victims, in a sort of hypnotic state, begin to wander\naround in circles that spiral increasingly inward until they eventually end up\nat the spot where the anaconda is hiding, waiting to crush them with her\nembrace. The anaconda is the kind of predator that hunters would like to be:\none that is not initially recognized as such.\n\nOf the various organisms that are used as ingredients for hunting or love\ncharms, certainly the metallic-blue–colored whiplash beetle, which Juanicu\ncalls candarira,[28](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn28) is among the most visually stunning.\nOn a collecting trip in the woods with him I once pulled back a mat of leaf\nlitter to discover a dazzling pair of the shiny slender beetles endlessly\ncircling one another. The pulverized remains of these insects, according to\nJuanicu, can be placed in the food or drink of a woman one wishes to attract.\nThe woman who comes under the spell of this charm will madly follow the man\nwho is responsible. The insects can also be placed in a hunting bag, to\nattract peccaries to the hunter. In the endless way in which they circle one\nanother, like the serpent Oroborus biting its tail, these insects bind\npredator and prey into one, such that their roles become confused. This is\nseduction; the prey is now predator, and the original predator incorporates\nthis apparent reversal in its mode of predation. Seduction captures the not\nalways equal ways in which subjects and objects reciprocally create each other\nthrough cosmic webs of predation.\n\nA similar reversal occurs when the wife of a young man is pregnant. In Ávila\nsuch men are known as aucashu yaya, which means something like “fathers of\nbeings that are not yet fully human” (“auca” refers to those people considered\nsavages as well as to the unbaptized). Fetuses need continuous contributions\nof semen and the soul-stuff it contains in order to grow. As Hilario\nexplained, “When the semen passes over” to the woman during sex, “the soul\ncrosses too.”[29](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn29) The resulting loss of soul-stuff over\nthe course of a pregnancy weakens men. Rosalina once complained to her\nneighbor that her son had become extremely lazy and unable to hunt since his\nwife became pregnant. Her son had become soul blind to the other selves in the\nforest as a result of his soul loss. People in Ávila call this compromised\ncondition ahhuas. Expectant fathers experience morning sickness like their\npregnant wives, and when the child is born they must observe a period of\ncouvade through a variety of restrictions. They also become more aggressive\nthroughout the pregnancy and are prone to fighting.\n\nThese expectant fathers lose their ability to be effective predators. They\nbecome soul blind. This is felt throughout the forest ecology of selves.\nAnimals will suddenly refuse to enter the traps of expectant fathers, and when\nsuch men place fish poison in the water during communal fishing trips fish\nyields will be very low.\n\nGame animals, recognizing this new status, no longer fear these hunters.\nAnimals sense them as mean, and instead of becoming afraid of them they become\nangered and aggressive. What is more, even skittish herbivores begin to treat\nthese once-formidable hunters as prey. Animals in the forest that are usually\ndocile and wary, such as deer and the gray-necked wood rail (pusara), will\nsuddenly become enraged and sometimes even attack these men. Ventura recounted\nto me that when his wife was pregnant deer in the forest suddenly charged\nhim—on two separate occasions! And one of the deer even kicked him in the\nchest.\n\nVentura’s sister, Angelicia, caught a baby coati in a spring trap and decided\nto keep it as a pet. Contemplating holding this creature in my arms, I asked\nher if the coati was liable to be aggressive toward me. Knowing that I was\nsingle, she laughed and then responded teasingly, “Only if you’re an aucashu\nyaya . . .”\n\nThis weakened and soul blind condition of expectant fathers can be exploited.\nIn the days when herds of white-lipped peccaries still passed through the\nÁvila region, hunters took the men into the forest and used them as charms, to\nattract these animals. As the peccaries—suddenly transformed into\npredators—would furiously charge the weakened and soul blind prey-victim, the\nvictim’s companions, who had been hiding in ambush, would jump out and kill\nthe pigs.\n\nHere again, through a process of seduction, predator and prey roles become\nreversed. The expectant father, unable to perceive other selves in the forest,\nhas become an object. He is aicha—dead meat—to the peccaries and a tool, a\ncharm, to his companions. Predator-prey relations are always nested, and this\ntoo is important for this charm to work. What at one level is a reversal of\nself-object relations (the expectant father is now hunted by his former prey)\nis nested within a higher-level relationship that reorients the direction of\npredation; the Runa—here a sort of distributed self in the figure of the group\nof hunters acting in unison—are reinstated as the true predator, and the pigs\nbecome meat, thanks to the temporarily desubjectified state of the expectant\nfather.\n\nHunting charms in general attract animals that are considered “strong runners”\n(sinchi puri). These include tapirs, deer, and curassows. This too is in\nkeeping with the idea that the goal of hunting and love charms is to make\nfully intentional selves come to men. The largely stationary and slow-moving\nsloths, by contrast, are not attracted by charms. Charms, then, are used with\nbeings that are seen to have a lot of manifest “agency.” Only very mobile\nbeings—those with highly apparent intentionality—can be seduced. It is their\nagency, marked by their ability to act as if they were predators, that allows\nprey to be seduced. Game meat, aicha, must be alive before it can become dead.\n\nIn this regard, it is interesting to note that virtually all Ávila hunting and\nlove charms come from animals.[30](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn30) There is, however, one\nnotable exception: buhyu panga, a small hemiepiphytic vine belonging to the\nAraceae family.[31](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn31) It has the following unusual quality:\nwhen the torn pieces of its leaves are thrown into a stream, they dance around\non top of the water’s surface.[32](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn32) The name refers to the\nway the leaves’ movements resemble those of pink river dolphins (buhyu) as\nthey frolic in the confluences of rivers. Like the teeth of the river dolphin,\nthis plant can become an ingredient for charms. Because the pieces of the\nleaves are drawn to each other and “stick together” (llutarimun) on the\nwater’s surface, this plant can attract game or women to the person who\nincorporates it into a charm. In general, hunting and love charms, in keeping\nwith their purpose of effecting attraction, have as their ingredients only\nanimal products because these come from organisms that are mobile. Buhyu\npanga, a leaf that moves on its own, is an exception that proves this rule.\n\nLike predator/prey distinctions, gender functions as a shifting pronominal\nmarker in this ecology of selves. When I was in the forest on hunting or plant\ncollecting trips, my Runa companion would on many occasions detect game and\nthen tell me to wait behind as he ran ahead with his gun cocked and ready to\nfire. Many times, as I waited quietly for him to return, the very game he was\npursuing would approach me instead. I had this experience on several\noccasions. Troops of woolly monkeys high up in the canopy would circle back\ntoward me. Capuchins would jump through the branches just above my head. Lone\nbrocket deer would shoot past me, and small herds of collared peccaries would\nventure so close that I could almost touch them. When I asked why the animals\nwould come to me instead of to the hunter the response was that, like a woman,\nI was unarmed and therefore the animals did not see me as a threatening\npredator and they were not frightened by my presence.\n\nDEFAMILIARIZING THE HUMAN\n\nEthnographic fieldwork, involving intensive immersion in the lifeways—the\nlanguage, the customs, the culture—of a foreign society, has traditionally\nbeen the preferred anthropological technique for critical self-reflection.\nThrough an often painful and disorienting but ultimately liberating process,\nwe immerse ourselves in a strange culture until its logics, meanings, and\nsentiments become familiar to us. By doing so, what we once took for\ngranted—our natural and familiar way of doing things—comes, on our return\nhome, to look strange. By stepping into another culture, fieldwork allows us,\nfor a moment, to step outside of our own.\n\nAnthropology allows us to move beyond our culture, but we never quite leave\nthe human. What we are supposed to enter is always another culture. Ávila\ntechniques of self-reflexive defamiliarization, Runa forms of anthropological\nwandering, by contrast, are not based on traveling to a different culture but\non adopting a different kind of body. Natures are what become strange here,\nnot cultures. Bodies are multiple and mutable, and the human body is only one\nof the many kinds of bodies that a self might inhabit. What kind of\nanthropology can emerge through this form of defamiliarizing the human?\n\nBecause eating entails such a palpable process of bodily transmutation, this\nform of reflexivity often involves ingestion. Some people in Ávila jokingly\nrefer to edible leafcutter ants as people’s crickets (runa jiji). Monkeys eat\ncrickets, and when people eat ants—whole and sometimes even raw, crunchy\nexoskeleton and all—they too, in a certain sense, become monkeys. Another\nexample: Many species of forest and cultivated trees belonging to the genus\nInga (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) are called pacai in Quichua. They produce edible\nfruits that can be pulled down off the tree and eaten. The flesh surrounding\nthe seeds is fluffy, white, watery, and sweet. Another legume, Parkia\nbalslevii, which belongs to the same subfamily, superficially resembles pacai\nin the shape of its fruits. The fruits of this tree are also edible, but its\nbranches are very high and the fruits cannot be readily reached. Instead, they\nfall to the ground when they are overripe or rotten. The flesh begins to\nferment and becomes brown and syrupy, like an off-flavored molasses. This tree\nis called illahuanga pacai, the vulture’s pacai. From the perspective of\nvultures, rotting food is sweet; when the Runa eat vulture pacai, they adopt\nthe point of view of a vulture; they come to enjoy rotting fruit as if it were\nfresh.\n\nSeeing insects as appropriate food or seeing rotting things as sweet is\nsomething that other kinds of bodies do. When we eat ants-as-crickets or\nrotting vulture-pacai-as-sweet we are stepping out of our bodies into those of\nother beings, and in doing so, we see a different world from the subjective,\nI, point of view of another kind of embodiment. We are able, for a moment, to\nlive in a different nature.\n\nAn inordinate interest in situating perspectives encourages an almost Zenlike\nmindfulness to one’s precise state of being at any given moment. Here, as\nLuisa remembered them, are her exact thoughts at the precise moment her dogs\nwere killed by a jaguar in the bush. The banality of her thoughts stands in\nmarked contrast to the attack that was simultaneously taking\nplace.[33](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn33)\n\n> Here I was with my thoughts elsewhere,\n>\n> thinking, “should I go to Marina’s or what?”\n>\n> With my mind somewhere else, thinking,\n>\n> “in order to go there\n>\n> I’ll just quickly\n>\n> slip on a dress.\n>\n> But I no longer have a good dress to change into,” I thought . . .\n\nLuisa mindfully situates this daydream, and by extension herself, even though,\nas she says, she is not present but elsewhere. She locates herself in a “here”\nby mapping her thoughts to a different here: the site of the jaguar’s attack\non the dogs.\n\nThat attack occurred in the intimate female sphere of the abandoned gardens, a\npatchwork of transitional fallows and forests that Amériga, Delia, and Luisa\nwould regularly frequent to collect fish poison, chunda palm fruits, and other\nproducts. By invading this domain, the jaguar had wandered outside of its\nproper territory deep in the forest. At one point Luisa angrily asked, “Are\nthere no ridges at the banks of the Suno River?” “Ridges like that,” she\nimplored, “are the right places” for jaguars.[34](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn34) Because\nthe jaguar that killed the dogs had undoubtedly been watching the women as\nthey frequented their private gardens and fallows, Amériga, Delia, and Luisa\nwere outraged. They felt that the presence of the jaguar in this intimate\nsphere was invasive. Delia noted that such places are supposed to be safe from\npredators. This is how Amériga described the jaguar’s violation of their\nintimate space:\n\n> What kind of beast roams\n>\n> around our old dwellings\n>\n> just listening to us pissing?\n>\n> In those places where we’ve pissed, the jaguar’s just walking around.\n\nImagining how one is seen in a very private moment through the eyes of another\nbeing is profoundly discomforting. It too is a form of defamiliarization, one\nthat is highly disturbing, for it highlights the vulnerable nature of an\nisolated self, reduced to oneself—soul blind—cut off from others and exposed\nto a powerful predator.\n\nSOUL BLINDNESS\n\nWhat might it be like “see” ourselves in the very process of becoming blind to\nour own souls? One Ávila myth about the failed eradication of the juri juri\ndemons, which Hilario related to his nephew Alejandro while sipping huayusa\ntea in the predawn hours, explores this terrifying possibility. This myth, I\nshould note, parallels in a curious fashion the Spanish report of the 1578\nuprising (see the introduction) in which all the Spaniards were killed, save,\naccording to this account, a young girl who was spared because one of the\nnatives wanted to marry her.\n\nWith the help of a tree lizard, the humans found the last hideout of the juri\njuri demons high up in a chunchu tree.[35](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn35) They ringed\nthe tree with big piles of hot peppers, which they set on fire in order to\nchoke out the demons. All the demons plummeted to their deaths except one.\nWhen this last juri juri finally fell to the ground she assumed the form of a\nbeautiful white woman. A young man took pity on her. They married and began to\nraise a family. While bathing their children, the demon began to secretly eat\nthem (“sucking their brains out, tso tso, from the crowns of their heads,”\nAmériga, to Hilario’s annoyance, chimed in). One day the husband awoke from a\nmagically induced sleep tormented by lice. He naively asked his wife to pick\nthem out of his hair. She sat behind him, in a position that made her now\ninvisible to him—a position that made it impossible for him to look back—and\nbegan combing her fingers through his hair. And then the man started to feel\nsomething strange.\n\n> His neck\n>\n> became bu—rning hot[36](Notes.xhtml#ch3fn36)\n\nHe then observed, in a matter-of-fact way, detached from any emotion:\n\n> “I’m blee—ding\n>\n> it would seem that\n>\n> I’m wou- wounded”\n\nAnd then, with a flat voice, devoid of any sentiment, the man concluded:\n\n> “you’re eating me”\n\n“It wasn’t,” Hilario explained, “like he was angry or anything.” He was merely\nstating—“just like that”—the simple fact that he was being eaten alive.\n\n> And he just slept . . .\n>\n> She made him sleep into his death.\n\nThe man is eaten alive but unable to experience this from a subjective\nperspective. He can never really “see” his wife, sitting behind him, eating\nhim. He cannot return her gaze. Instead, he can only experience his own demise\nfrom an external disembodied stance. He can only logically deduce that he is\nwounded, and then that he is being eaten alive, by the physical effects this\naction produces. He has become completely “blind” to himself as a self. He\nfeels no pain, nor does he suffer; he just registers the sensation that his\nneck is burning. Only later does he come to the realization that this is\ncaused by his own blood flowing from his head. His demonic wife causes him to\nexperience his death from outside his body. Before his life fades into\nindistinction—“Out of sleeping a waking,/Out of waking a sleep;/Life death\novertaking;/Deep underneath deep?”—before he moves from affectless catatonia\nto sleep, and from sleep to death, he becomes an object to himself. He becomes\ninert, unfeeling. And his only awareness, however dimly perceived, is of this\nfact. This is a dystopian glimpse of a world where agency becomes divorced\nfrom a feeling, purposeful, thinking, embodied, and localized self. This is\nthe final terminus of selfhood: radical soul blindness, an intimation of a\nworld devoid of the enchantment of life, a world with no self, no souls, and\nno futures, just effects.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n![](images/img_0012.jpg)\n\nFOUR\n\n* * *\n\nTrans-Species Pidgins\n\nWhen Thou is spoken, the speaker has no thing for his object.

But he takes his stand in relation.\n\n—Martin Buber, I and Thou\n\nThe dogs should have known what was to befall them in the forest that day they\nwere killed. In a conversation she had with Delia and Luisa, back at the house\nshortly after we buried the dogs’ bodies, Amériga wondered aloud why her\nfamily’s canine companions were unable to augur their own deaths and, by\nextension, why she, their master, was caught unaware of the fate that would\nbefall them: “While I was by the fire, they didn’t dream,” she said. “They\njust slept, those dogs, and they’re usually real dreamers. Normally while\nsleeping by the fire they’ll bark, ‘hua hua hua.’” Dogs, I learned, dream, and\nby observing them as they dream people can know what their dreams mean. If, as\nAmériga suggested, their dogs would have barked “hua hua” in their sleep, this\nwould have been an indicator that they were dreaming of chasing animals, and\nthey would therefore have done the same in the forest the following day, for\nthis is how a dog barks when pursuing game. If, by contrast, they would have\nbarked “cuai” that night, this would be a sure signal that a jaguar would kill\nthem the following day, for this is how dogs cry out when attacked by\nfelines.[1](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn1)\n\nThat night, however, the dogs didn’t bark at all, and therefore, much to the\nconsternation of their masters, they failed to foretell their own deaths. As\nDelia proclaimed, “Therefore, they shouldn’t have died.” The realization that\nthe system of dream interpretation that people use to understand their dogs\nhad failed provoked an epistemological crisis of sorts; the women began to\nquestion whether they could ever know anything. Amériga, visibly frustrated,\nasked, “So how can we ever know?” Everyone laughed somewhat uneasily as Luisa\nreflected, “How is it knowable? Now, even when people are gonna die, we won’t\nbe able to know.” Amériga concluded simply, “It wasn’t meant to be known.”\n\nThe dreams and desires of dogs are, in principle, knowable, because all\nbeings, and not just humans, engage with the world and with each other as\nselves, that is, as beings that have a point of view. To understand other\nkinds of selves, one simply needs to learn how to inhabit their variously\nembodied points of view. So the question of how dogs dream matters deeply. Not\nonly because of the purported predictive power of dreams, but because\nimagining that the thoughts of dogs are not knowable would throw into question\nwhether it is ever possible to know the intentions and goals of any kind of\nself.\n\nEntertaining the viewpoints of other beings blurs the boundaries that separate\nkinds of selves. In their mutual attempts to live together and to make sense\nof one another, dogs and people, for example, increasingly come to partake in\na sort of shared trans-species habitus that does not observe the distinctions\nwe might otherwise make between nature and culture; specifically, the\nhierarchical relationship that unites the Runa and their dogs is based as much\non the ways in which humans have been able to harness canine forms of social\norganization as it is on the legacies of a colonial history in the Upper\nAmazon that links people in Ávila to the white-mestizo world beyond their\nvillage.\n\nTrans-species communication is dangerous business. It must be undertaken in\nways that avoid, on the one hand, the complete transmutation of the human\nself—no one wants to permanently become a dog—and, on the other, the monadic\nisolation represented by what in the previous chapter I called soul blindness,\nwhich is the solipsistic flipside of this transmutation. To mitigate such\ndangers people in Ávila make strategic use of different trans-species\ncommunicative strategies. These strategies reveal something important about\nthe need to venture beyond the human and the challenges of doing so in ways\nthat don’t dissolve the human. These strategies also reveal something\nimportant about the logic inherent to semiosis. Understanding these, in turn,\nis central to the anthropology beyond the human that I am developing. To tease\nout some of these properties, I’ve chosen, as a heuristic device to focus my\ninquiry, the following small but vexing ethnological conundrum: Why do people\nin Ávila interpret dog dreams literally (e.g., when a dog barks in its sleep\nthis is an omen that it will bark in identical fashion the following day in\nthe forest), whereas for the most part they interpret their own dreams\nmetaphorically (e.g., if a man dreams of killing a chicken he will kill a game\nbird in the forest the following day)?\n\nALL TOO HUMAN\n\nThe ecology of selves within which the Runa, their dogs, and the many beings\nof the forest live reaches well beyond the human, but it is also one that is\n“all too human.”[2](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn2) I use this term to refer to the ways\nin which our lives and those of others get caught up in the moral webs we\nhumans spin. I wish to signal that an anthropology that seeks a more capacious\nunderstanding of the human by attending to our relations to those who stand\nbeyond us must also understand such relations by virtue of the ways in which\nthey can be affected by that which is distinctively human.\n\nI argued in chapter 1 that symbolic reference is distinctively human. That is,\nthe symbolic is something that is (on this planet) unique to humans. The moral\nis also distinctively human, because to think morally and to act ethically\nrequires symbolic reference. It requires the ability to momentarily distance\nourselves from the world and our actions in it to reflect on our possible\nmodes of future conduct—conduct that we can deem potentially good for others\nthat are not us. This distancing is achieved through symbolic reference.\n\nMy intention here is not to arrive at a universal understanding of what might\nbe an appropriate moral system. Nor is it a claim that living well with\nothers—what Haraway (2008: 288–89) calls “flourishing”—necessarily requires\nrational abstraction, or morality (even though thinking about the good does).\nBut to imagine an anthropology beyond the human that does not simply project\nhuman qualities everywhere we must situate morality ontologically. That is, we\nmust be precise about where and when morality comes to exist. To state it\nbaldly, before humans walked this earth there was no morality and no ethics.\nMorality is not constitutive of the nonhuman beings with whom we share this\nplanet. It is potentially appropriate to morally evaluate actions we humans\ninitiate. This is not the case for nonhumans (see Deacon 1997: 219).\n\nValue, by contrast, is intrinsic to the broader nonhuman living world because\nit is intrinsic to life. There are things that are good or bad for a living\nself and its potential for growth (see Deacon 2012: 25, 322), keeping in mind\nthat by “growth” I mean the possibility to learn by experience (see chapter\n2). Because nonhuman living selves can grow it is appropriate to think about\nthe moral implications our actions have on their potential to grow well—to\nflourish.[3](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn3)\n\nAs with the symbolic, to say that the moral is distinctive does not mean that\nit is cut off from that from which it emerges. Morality stands in a relation\nof emergent continuity to value, just as symbolic reference stands in a\nrelation of emergent continuity to indexical reference. And value extends\nbeyond the human. It is a constitutive feature of living selves. Our moral\nworlds can affect nonhuman beings precisely because there are things that are\ngood or bad for them. And some of those things that are good or bad for them\nare also, we might learn if we could learn to listen to these beings with whom\nour lives are entangled, good or bad for us as well.\n\nThis is especially true when we begin to consider how this us that comprises\nus is an emergent self that can incorporate many kinds of beings in its coming\nconfigurations. We humans are the products of the multiple nonhuman beings\nthat have come to make and continue to make us who we are. Our cells are, in a\nsense, themselves selves, and their organelles were once, in the distant past,\nfree-living bacterial selves; our bodies are vast ecologies of selves\n(Margulis and Sagan 2002; McFall-Ngai et al. 2013). None of these selves in\nand of themselves are loci of moral action, even though larger selves with\nemergent properties (properties such as the capacity for moral thinking, in\nthe case of humans) can subsume them.\n\nThe multispecies encounter is, as Haraway has intimated, a particularly\nimportant domain for cultivating an ethical practice. In it, we are most\nclearly confronted with what she calls “significant otherness” (Haraway 2003).\nIn these encounters we are confronted by an otherness that is radically\n(significantly) other—without, I would add, that otherness being\nincommensurable or “incognizable” (see chapter 2). But in these encounters we\ncan nonetheless find ways to enter intimate (significant) relations with these\nothers who are radically not us. Many of these selves who are not ourselves\nare also not human. That is, they are not symbolic creatures (which means that\nthey are also not loci of moral judgment). As such, they force us to find new\nways to listen; they force us to think beyond our moral worlds in ways that\ncan help us imagine and realize more just and better worlds.\n\nA more capacious ethical practice, one that mindfully attends to finding ways\nof living in a world peopled by other selves, should come to be a feature of\nthe possible worlds we imagine and seek to engender with other beings. Just\nhow to go about doing this, just how to decide on what kind of flourishing to\nencourage—and to make room for the many deaths on which all flourishing\ndepends—is itself a moral problem (see Haraway 2008: 157, 288). Morality is a\nconstitutive feature of our human lives; it is one of human life’s many\ndifficulties. It is also something we can better understand through an\nanthropology beyond the human; semiosis and morality must be thought together\nbecause the moral cannot emerge without the symbolic.\n\nThe qualifier “all too” (as opposed to “distinctive”) is not value-neutral. It\ncarries its own moral judgment. It implies that there is something potentially\ntroubling at play here. This chapter and those that follow attend to this by\nopening themselves to the complicated ways in which the Runa are immersed in\nthe many all-too-human legacies of a colonial history that affect so much of\nlife in this part of the Amazon. These chapters, in short, begin to open\nthemselves to problems that involve power.\n\nDOG-HUMAN ENTANGLEMENTS\n\nIn many ways dogs and people in Ávila live in independent worlds. People often\nignore their dogs, and once they mature into adults their masters don’t even\nnecessarily feed them. Dogs, for their part, seem to largely ignore people.\nResting in the cool shade under the house, stealing off after the bitch next\ndoor, or, as Hilario’s dogs did a few days before they were killed, hunting\ndown a deer on their own—dogs largely live their own\nlives.[4](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn4) And yet their lives are also intimately\nentangled with those of their human masters. This entanglement does not just\ninvolve the circumscribed context of the home or village. It is also the\nproduct of the interactions that dogs and people have with the biotic world of\nthe forest as well as with the sociopolitical world beyond Ávila through which\nboth species are linked by the legacy of a colonial history. Dog-human\nrelationships need to be understood in terms of both these poles. The\nhierarchical structure on which these relationships are based is\nsimultaneously (but not equally) a biological and a colonial fact.\nRelationships of predation, for example, characterize how the Runa and their\ndogs relate to the forest as well as to the world of whites.\n\nThrough a process that Brian Hare and others (2002) call “phylogenetic\nenculturation” dogs have penetrated human social worlds to such an extent that\nthey exceed even chimpanzees in understanding certain aspects of human\ncommunication (such as different forms of pointing to indicate the location of\nfood). Becoming human in the right ways is central to surviving as a dog in\nÁvila.[5](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn5) Accordingly, people strive to guide their dogs\nalong this path in much the same way that they help youngsters to mature into\nadulthood. Just as they advise a child on how to live correctly, people\ncounsel their dogs. To do this, they make them ingest a mixture of plants and\nother substances, such as agouti bile, known collectively as tsita. Some of\nthe ingredients are hallucinogenic and also quite\ntoxic.[6](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn6) By giving them advice in this fashion, people in\nÁvila are trying to reinforce a human ethos of comportment that dogs should\nshare.[7](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn7)\n\nLike Runa adults, dogs should not be lazy. For dogs, this means that instead\nof chasing chickens and other domestic animals, they should pursue forest\ngame. In addition, dogs, like people, should not be violent. This means that\ndogs shouldn’t bite people or bark at them loudly. Finally, dogs, like their\nmasters, should not expend all their energy on sex. I’ve observed people\nadminister tsita to dogs on several occasions. What happened at Ventura’s\nhouse is typical in many respects. According to Ventura, before his dog\nPuntero discovered females he was a good hunter, but once he began to be\nsexually active he lost the ability to be aware of animals in the forest.\nBecause soul-substance is passed to a developing fetus through semen during\nsex, he, like the expectant fathers I discussed in chapter 3, became soul\nblind. So early one morning Ventura and his family captured Puntero, fastened\nhis snout shut with a strip of vine, and hog-tied him. Ventura then poured\ntsita down Puntero’s snout. While doing this he said the following:\n\n> chases little rodents\n>\n> it will not bite chickens\n>\n> chases swiftly\n>\n> it should say, “hua hua”\n>\n> it will not lie\n\nThe way Ventura spoke to his dog is extremely unusual. I’ll return to it\nlater. For now, I’ll only give a general gloss. In the first phrase “little\nrodents” refers obliquely to the agoutis that dogs are supposed to chase. The\nsecond phrase is an admonition not to attack domestic animals but to hunt\nforest ones instead. The third phrase encourages the dog to chase animals but\notherwise not to run ahead of the hunter. The fourth phrase reaffirms what a\ngood dog should be doing: finding game and therefore barking “hua hua.” The\nfinal phrase refers to the fact that some dogs “lie.” That is, they bark “hua\nhua” even when there are no animals present.\n\nAs Ventura poured the liquid, Puntero attempted to bark. Because his snout was\ntied shut he was unable to do so. When he was finally released Puntero\nstumbled off and remained in a daze all day. Such a treatment carries real\nrisks. Many dogs do not survive this ordeal, which highlights how dependent\ndogs are on exhibiting human qualities for their physical survival. There is\nno place in Runa society for dogs-as-animals.\n\nDogs, however, are not just animals-becoming-people. They can also acquire\nqualities of jaguars, the quintessential predators. Like jaguars, dogs are\ncarnivorous. Their natural propensity (when they haven’t succumbed to domestic\nlaziness) is to hunt animals in the forest. Even when dogs are fed vegetal\nfood, such as palm hearts, people in Ávila refer to it as meat in their\npresence.\n\nPeople also see dogs as their potential predators. During the conquest the\nSpaniards used dogs to attack the forebears of the Ávila\nRuna.[8](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn8) Today this canine predatory nature is visible\nwith regard to the special ritual meal that forms part of the feast known as\nthe aya pichca, which I discussed in the previous chapter. This meal, which\nconsists of cooked palm hearts, is eaten early in the morning after the ghost\nof the deceased is sent back to where he or she was born, to reunite with the\nafterbirth. The long tubular hearts, which are left intact for this meal,\nresemble human bones (by contrast, when palm hearts are prepared for everyday\nmeals they are finely chopped).[9](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn9) Resembling bones, the\npalm hearts presented at this meal serve as a substitute for the corpse of the\ndeceased in a sort of “mortuary endo-cannibalistic” feast, not unlike other\nfeasts in other parts of Amazonia (and perhaps historically in the Ávila\nregion as well; see Oberem 1980: 288) in which the bones of the dead are\nconsumed by their living relatives (see Fausto 2007). Those present at the\nmeal held after we sent off Jorge’s ghost stressed that under no circumstances\nmust dogs eat the palm hearts. Dogs, who see palm hearts as meat, are\npredators par excellence, for, like jaguars and cannibalistic humans they can\ncome to treat people as prey.[10](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn10)\n\nDogs, then, can acquire jaguarlike attributes, but jaguars can also become\ncanine. Despite their manifest role as predators, jaguars are also the\nsubservient dogs of the spirit beings who are the masters of the animals in\nthe forest. According to Ventura, “What we think of as a jaguar is actually a\n[spirit animal master’s] dog.”\n\nIt is important to note that in Ávila these spirit animal\nmasters,[11](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn11) who keep jaguars as dogs, are often\ndescribed as powerful white estate owners and priests. People liken the game\nanimals these masters own and protect to the herds of cattle that whites keep\non their ranches. In one sense, then, the Ávila Runa are not so different from\nmany other Amazonians who understand human and nonhuman sociality as one and\nthe same thing. That is, for many Amazonians, the social principles found in\nhuman society are the same as those that structure animal and spirit societies\nof the forest. And this goes in both directions: nonhuman sociality informs\nunderstandings of human sociality just as much as human sociality informs that\nof nonhumans (see Descola 1994). Ávila, however, has always been part of\nlarger political economies at the same time that it has been fully immersed in\nthe forest’s ecology of selves. This means that Runa “society” also includes a\nsense of the fraught relations the Runa have to others in a broader colonial,\nand now republican, arena. As a consequence, the sociality that extends to the\nnonhumans of the forest is also informed by those all-too-human histories in\nwhich the Runa, over the generations, have become entangled. This, then, in\npart, is why the animal masters that live deep in the forest are white (for a\nfurther discussion of what exactly being “white” here means, see chapters 5\nand 6).\n\nWere-jaguars—runa puma—are also dogs. As Ventura explained it to me, with\nreference to his recently deceased father, when a person “with jaguar”\n(pumayu) dies, his or her soul goes to the forest to “become a dog.” Were-\njaguars become the “dogs” of the spirit animal masters. That is, they become\nsubservient to them in the same way that people from Ávila enter subservient\nrelations when they go to work as field hands for estate owners and priests. A\nruna puma, then, is simultaneously Runa, a potent feline predator, and the\nobedient dog of a white animal master.\n\nIn addition to being emblematic of the Runa predicament of being\nsimultaneously predator and prey, dominant and submissive, dogs are extensions\nof people’s actions in the world beyond the village. Because they serve as\nscouts, often detecting prey well before their masters can, dogs extend Runa\npredatory endeavors in the forest. They are also, along with the humans,\nsubject to the same threats of predation by jaguars.\n\nIn addition to the linkages they help people forge with the beings of the\nforest, dogs allow the Runa to reach out to that other world beyond the\nvillage—the realm of white-mestizo colonists who own ranches near Ávila\nterritory. Ávila dogs are woefully underfed, and as a result they are often\nquite unhealthy. For this reason, they are rarely able to produce viable\noffspring, and people from Ávila must often turn to outsiders to obtain pups.\nA human-induced canine reproductive failure, then, makes people dependent on\nthese outsiders for the procreation of their dogs. They also tend to adopt the\ndog names that colonists use. In this regard, the names Pucaña and Huiqui are\nexceptions. More common are dog names such as Marquesa, Quiteña, or even\nTiwintza (a toponym of Jivaroan origin, marking the site of Ecuador’s 1995\nterritorial conflict with Peru). This practice of using the dog names\npreferred by colonists is another indicator of how dogs always link the Runa\nto a broader social world, even when they are also products of a domestic\nsociability.\n\nAs a link between forest and outside worlds, dogs in many ways resemble the\nRuna, who, as “Christian Indians,” have historically served as mediators\nbetween the urban world of whites and the sylvan one of the Auca, or non-\nChristian “unconquered” indigenous peoples, especially the Huaorani (Hudelson\n1987; Taylor 1999: 195).[12](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn12) Until approximately the\n1950s the Runa were actually enlisted by powerful estate owners—ironically,\nlike the mastiffs of the Spanish conquest used to hunt down Runa forebears—to\nhelp them track down and attack Huaorani settlements.[13](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn13)\nAnd, as ranch hands, they continue to help colonists engage with the forest\nby, for example, hunting for them.\n\nI should also note that the kinds of dogs that people in Ávila acquire from\ncolonists do not for the most belong to any recognizable breed. Throughout\nmuch of Spanish-speaking Ecuador, such dogs are disparagingly described as\n“runa” (as in “un perro runa”)—that is, as mutts. In Quichua, by contrast,\nruna means person. It is used as a sort of pronominal marker of the subject\nposition—for all selves see themselves as persons—and it is only hypostasized\nas ethnonym in objectifying practices such as ethnography, racial\ndiscrimination, and identity politics (see chapter 6). This Quichua term for\n“person,” however, has come to be used in Spanish to refer to mongrel\ndogs.[14](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn14) It would not be too far a stretch to suggest\nthat runa for many Ecuadorians refers to those dogs that lack a kind of\ncivilized status, those sin cultura, or without culture. Certain kinds of dogs\nand a certain group of indigenous people, the Quichua-speaking Runa, according\nto this colonial primitivist logic, have come to serve as markers along this\nimagined route from animality to humanity.\n\nTrans-species relations often involve an important hierarchical component;\nhumans and dogs are mutually constituted but in ways that are fundamentally\nunequal for the parties involved.[15](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn15) The domestication\nof dogs, beginning some fifteen thousand years ago (Savolainen et al. 2002),\nhas been dependent, in part, on the fact that the progenitors of dogs were\nhighly social animals that lived in well-established dominance hierarchies.\nPart of the process of domestication involved replacing the apex of this\nhierarchy in such a way that dogs would imprint on their human master as the\nnew pack leader. Human-dog relations are dependent on the ways in which canine\nand human socialities merge, and they are always predicated, in some measure,\non the ongoing establishment of relations of dominance and submission (Ellen\n1999: 62). In colonial and postcolonial situations, such as that in which\npeople in Ávila are immersed, this merger acquires renewed meaning. Dogs are\nsubmissive to their human masters in the same way that the Runa, historically,\nhave been forced to be submissive to white estate owners, government\nofficials, and priests (see Muratorio 1987). This position is not fixed,\nhowever. The lowland Runa, as opposed to some of their highland indigenous\nQuichua-speaking counterparts, have always maintained a relatively higher\ndegree of autonomy vis-à-vis state authorities. They, and their canine\ncompanions, then, are also like powerful predatory jaguars that, for their\npart, are not just the servile dogs of the animal masters.\n\nAdopting the viewpoint of another kind of being to a certain extent means that\nwe “become” another kind “with” that being (see Haraway 2008: 4, 16–17). And\nyet these sorts of entanglements are dangerous. People in Ávila seek to avoid\nthe state of monadic isolation that I’ve been calling soul blindness, by which\nthey lose the ability to be aware of the other selves that inhabit the\ncosmos.[16](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn16) And yet they want to do so without fully\ndissolving that sort of selfhood distinctive to their position in this cosmos\nas human beings. Soul blindness and becoming an-other-with-an-other are\nopposite extremes along a continuum that spans the range of ways of inhabiting\nan ecology of selves. There is a constant tension, then, between the blurring\nof interspecies boundaries and maintaining difference, and the challenge is to\nfind the semiotic means to productively sustain this tension without being\npulled to either extreme.[17](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn17)\n\nDREAMING\n\nBecause dreaming is a privileged mode of communication through which, via\nsouls, contact among radically different kinds of beings becomes possible, it\nis an important site for this negotiation. According to people in Ávila,\ndreams are the product of the ambulations of the soul. During sleep, the soul\nseparates from the body, its “owner,”[18](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn18) and interacts\nwith the souls of other beings. Dreams are not commentaries on the world; they\ntake place in it (see also Tedlock 1992).\n\nThe vast majority of dreams that are discussed in Ávila are about hunting or\nother forest encounters. Most are interpreted metaphorically and establish a\ncorrespondence between domestic and forest realms. For example, if a hunter\ndreams of killing a domestic pig he will kill a peccary in the forest the\nfollowing day. The nocturnal encounter is one between two souls—that of the\npig and that of the Runa hunter. Killing the pig’s nocturnal domestic\nmanifestation therefore renders soulless its forest manifestation to be\nencountered the following day. Now soul blind, this creature can be easily\nfound in the forest and hunted because it is no longer cognizant of those\nother selves that might stand to it as predators.\n\nMetaphoric dreams are ways of experiencing certain kinds of ecological\nconnections among kinds of beings in such a manner that their differences are\nrecognized and maintained without losing the possibility for communication.\nThis is accomplished by virtue of the fact that metaphor is able to unite\ndisparate but analogous, and therefore related, entities. It recognizes a gap\nas it points to a connection. Under normal waking circumstances, the Runa see\npeccaries in the forest as wild animals, even though they see them in their\ndreams as domestic pigs. But things get more complicated. The spirit animal\nmasters who own and care for these animals (which appear as peccaries to the\nRuna in their waking lives) see them as their domestic pigs. So when people\ndream they come to see these animals from the spirit masters’ point of view\n–as domestic pigs. Importantly, the spirit animal masters are considered\ndominant kinds of beings. From the perspective of these masters, the literal\nground for the metaphoric relationship between peccary and domestic pig is\ntheanimal-as-domesticate. What is literal and what is metaphoric shifts. For\nthe animal masters, what we would think of as “nature” (i.e., the “real”\nforest animals) is not the ground (cf. Strathern 1980: 189); peccaries are\nreally domestic pigs. So one could say that from the perspective of an animal\nmaster, which is the dominant one and therefore the one that carries more\nweight, a hunter’s dream of a pig is the literal ground for which his forest\nencounter with a peccary the following day will be a metaphor. In Ávila the\nliteral refers to a customary interpretation of the world internal to a given\ndomain. Metaphor, by contrast, is used to align the situated points of view of\nbeings that inhabit different worlds. The distinction between figure and\nground, then, can change according to context. What stays constant is that\nmetaphor establishes a difference in perspective between kinds of beings\ninhabiting different domains. By linking the points of view of two beings at\nthe same time that it recognizes the different worlds these beings inhabit,\nmetaphor serves as a crucial brake that the Runa impose on the propensity\ntoward blurring that is inherent to their way of interacting with other kinds\nof beings.\n\nCANINE IMPERATIVES\n\nDreams, recall from the previous chapter, confirmed the identity of the\npredator that killed the dogs. Hilario’s dead father’s puma was the culprit.\nBut Amériga’s question remained unanswered. Why did the dogs fail to augur\ntheir own deaths? She felt that the dogs’ dreams should have revealed the true\nnature of the forest encounter with the jaguar.\n\nHow could Amériga presume to know how her dogs dreamed? In order to address\nthis, it is important to first understand in more detail how people in Ávila\ntalk with their dogs. Talking to dogs is necessary but also dangerous; the\nRuna do not want to become dogs in the process. Certain modes of communication\nare important in this delicate cross-species negotiation, and it is to an\nanalysis of these that I now turn.\n\nIt is due to their privileged position relative to animals in the trans-\nspecies interpretive hierarchy that constitutes the forest ecology of selves\nthat the Runa feel they can readily understand the meanings of canine\nvocalizations.[19](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn19) Dogs, however, cannot, under normal\ncircumstances, understand the full range of human speech. As I indicated\nearlier, if people want dogs to understand them they must give the dogs\nhallucinogenic drugs. That is, they must make their dogs into shamans so that\nthey can traverse the boundaries that separate them from humans. I want to\nrevisit in more detail the scene in which Ventura advised his dog on how to\nbehave. While pouring the hallucinogenic mixture down Puntero’s snout, he\nturned to him and said:\n\n> 1.1 ucucha-ta tiu tiu\n>\n> rodent-ACC chase[20](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn20)\n>\n> chases little rodents[21](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn21)\n>\n> 1.2 atalpa ama cani-nga\n>\n> chicken NEG IMP bite-3FUT\n>\n> it will not bite chickens\n>\n> 1.3 sinchi tiu tiu\n>\n> strong chase\n>\n> chases swiftly\n>\n> 1.4 “hua hua” ni-n\n>\n> “hua hua” say-3\n>\n> it should say “hua hua” (the bark made when dogs are chasing animals)\n>\n> 1.5 ama llulla-nga\n>\n> NEG IMP lie-3FUT\n>\n> it will not lie (i.e., the dog should not bark as if it were chasing animals\n> when in reality it is not)\n\nI am now in a position to explain why this is an extremely strange way of\nspeaking.[22](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn22) When advising their dogs people in Ávila\naddress them directly but in the third person. This appears to be similar to\nthe Spanish usted system whereby third-person grammatical constructions are\nused in second-person pragmatic contexts to communicate status. Quichua,\nhowever, lacks such a deferential system. Notwithstanding, the Runa tweak\nQuichua to improvise one. That they are using grammatical constructions in new\nways is most evident in line 1.2. In Quichua ama is typically used in second-\nperson negative imperatives, as well as in negative subjunctives, but never in\ncombination with the third-person future marker as it is being used here. I am\ndubbing this anomalous negative command a “canine\nimperative.”[23](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn23)\n\nHere is the challenge: in order for people to communicate with dogs, dogs must\nbe treated as conscious human subjects (i.e., as Yous, even as Thous); yet\ndogs must simultaneously be treated as objects (Its) lest they talk back.\nThis, it appears, is why Ventura uses this canine imperative to address\nPuntero obliquely.[24](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn24) And this also seems to be part of\nthe reason that Puntero’s snout was tied shut during this process. If dogs\nwere to talk back, people would enter a canine subjectivity and therefore lose\ntheir privileged status as humans. By tying dogs down, in effect, denying them\ntheir animal bodies, they are permitting a human subjectivity to emerge.\nCanine imperatives, then, allow people to safely address this partially\nindividuated emerging human self about the partially deindividuated and\ntemporarily submerged canine one.[25](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn25)\n\nThe power-laden hierarchical relationship between dogs and humans that this\nattempt at communication reveals is analogous to that between humans and the\nspirit masters of animals. In the same way that people can understand their\ndogs, animal masters can readily understand the speech of humans; the Runa\nneed only talk to them. Indeed, as I’ve observed on several occasions, in the\nforest people address these spirits directly. Under normal circumstances,\nhowever, humans cannot readily understand animal masters. Just as dogs require\nthe hallucinogenic mixture tsita to understand the full range of human\nexpression, people ingest hallucinogens, especially aya huasca, so that they\ncan converse normally with these spirits. They use this opportunity to cement\nbonds of obligation with the spirit masters so that these, in turn, will allow\nthem to hunt their animals. One important way of establishing such bonds is\nthrough the spirit master’s daughters. Under the influence of hallucinogens,\nhunters attempt to cultivate amorous relations with them so that they will\nhelp them gain access to game meat via their fathers.\n\nThe relationship between these spirit lovers and Runa men is very similar to\nthat between the Runa and their dogs. People give advice to their dogs in the\nthird person and, in addition, tie their snouts shut, making it impossible for\ntheir dogs to respond. For related reasons, a spirit lover never allows her\nRuna partner to address her by name. Her proper name should be voiced only by\nother beings from the spirit master realm, and never in the presence of her\nhuman lovers. As one man told me, “One does not ask their names.” Instead, men\nare only allowed to address their spirit lovers with the title señora. In\nÁvila this Spanish term is used to refer to and address white women regardless\nof marital status. By prohibiting Runa men from addressing them directly, the\nanimal master’s daughters can protect their privileged perspective as spirits\nand, in a sense, also as whites. This is analogous to the ways in which people\ncommunicate with their dogs so as to protect their own special position as\nhumans.[26](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn26) At all levels, then, the goal is to be able\nto communicate across the boundaries that separate kinds without destabilizing\nthem.\n\nINTERSPECIES SPEECH\n\nPeople use oblique forms of communication, such as canine imperatives, to put\nbrakes on processes that threaten to blur the distinctions among kinds of\nbeings. Yet the language that they use when talking to their dogs is\nsimultaneously an instantiation of this same process of blurring. Accordingly,\nI have begun to think of it as a “trans-species pidgin.” Like a pidgin it is\ncharacterized by reduced grammatical structure. It is not fully inflected, and\nit exhibits minimal clause embedding and simplified person marking.\nFurthermore, pidgins often emerge in colonial situations of contact. Given how\nin Ávila dog-human relations are entangled with Runa-white ones, this colonial\nvalence seems particularly appropriate.\n\nIndicative of its status as a trans-species pidgin, Runa dog talk—in a manner\nthat is similar to the way Juanicu’s were-jaguar compadre both spoke and\npanted (see chapter 3)—incorporates elements of communicative modalities from\nboth human and animal realms. Using Quichua grammar, syntax, and lexicon, this\n“pidgin” exhibits elements of a human language. However, it also adopts\nelements of a preexisting trans-specific dog-human idiom. For example, tiu tiu\n(line 1.1) is used exclusively to spur dogs to chase game and is never used in\nhuman-human speech (except in quotation). In keeping with its paralinguistic\nidentity, tiu tiu is not inflected here (see chapter 1). This interspecies\npidgin also incorporates elements of dog talk. Hua hua (line 1.4) is an item\nfrom the canine lexicon. The Runa incorporate it into their utterances only\nthrough quotation. That is, they themselves would never bark. Hua hua is never\ninflected and is thus not fully integrated into human grammar. Both tiu tiu\nand hua hua involve reduplication, the iconic iteration of sound. This too is\nan important semiotic technique by which the Runa attempt to enter nonhuman,\nnonsymbolic referential modes.[27](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn27)\n\nThe Runa-dog trans-species pidgin is also like “motherese”—the purportedly\ndistinctive form of language that adult caregivers use when speaking to\nbabies—in that it exhibits grammatical simplification and is addressed to a\nsubject that does not have full linguistic capabilities. This is an additional\nway in which it manifests a colonial valence. As we know, in many colonial and\npostcolonial contexts such as the Ávila one, natives come to be treated as\nstanding to colonists as children stand to adults. Here is one example of how\nthis plays out in Ávila. An engineer from the Ministry of Agriculture\n(Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganadería), visited Ávila, along with his wife\nand children, in order to confer on it the legal status of “personhood”\n(personería jurídica) as a state-recognized indigenous community (comuna). A\nnumber of people told me that he had come to give them “advice,” for which\nthey used the verb camachina—a term that is also used to describe how adults\n“counsel” children and dogs. In his conversations with me, the engineer, in\nturn, referred to the inhabitants of Ávila, regardless of age, as “los\njóvenes” (youths, children). He and his wife—who, fittingly, is a\nschoolteacher—considered it their civic duty to mold the Ávila Runa into\nproper (i.e., mature, adult) Ecuadorian citizens. In fact, they insisted on\nbeginning the annual communal meeting with the national anthem, and they spent\nmuch of the long meeting reading and explaining portions of the Ecuadorian\nconstitution and carefully guiding the villagers through the government-\nmandated guidelines for democratically electing the comuna leaders. With\ntitles such as president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary, these\nleaders would, ideally, simultaneously reproduce the bureaucratic apparatus of\nthe state in the microcosm of the community and serve as the link between the\nvillage and the state. As I explore in the final chapter of this book, the\ncontours of the self in Ávila are as much the product of the relations people\nhave with nonhumans as they are the product of these sorts of intimate (and\noften paternalistic) encounters through which a larger nation-state comes to\nbe manifested in their lives.\n\nTHE CONSTRAINTS OF FORM\n\nThe human-canine trans-species pidgin, like motherese, is oriented toward\nbeings whose linguistic capabilities are in question. Although people in Ávila\ngo to great lengths to make their dogs understand human speech, how they\ncommunicate with their dogs must also conform to the exigencies of those\nspecies that cannot normally understand human speech, with its heavily\nsymbolic mode of reference. My cousin Vanessa who accompanied me on the\nunpleasant bus trip over the Andes into the Oriente (see chapter 1), finally\ngot to visit Ávila with me. Not long after arriving at Hilario’s house,\nhowever, she had the misfortune of being bitten on the calf by a young dog.\nThe next afternoon, this dog, herself a fresh arrival (having been recently\nbrought by one of Hilario’s sons from across the Suno River where this son\nworks as a field hand for colonists), bit her again. Hilario’s family was\nquite disturbed by this behavior—the dog’s “humanity” was at stake and, by\nextension, that of her masters—and Hilario and his other son Lucio therefore\ngave the dog the hallucinogenic tsita mixture and proceeded to “give her\nadvice” in much the same way that Ventura had counseled Puntero. On this\noccasion, however, they took the drugged dog, with her mouth securely tied,\nand placed her snout against the same spot where she had bitten Vanessa the\nday before. While they were doing this Hilario said:\n\n> 5.1 amu amu mana canina\n>\n> [She, Vanessa, is a] master, a master and is not to be bitten\n>\n> 5.2 amu amu amu imapata caparin\n>\n> [She is a] master, a master, a master, and there is no reason to bark\n>\n> 5.3 amuta ama caninga\n>\n> It will not bite the master\n\nHere, as visible in line 5.3, Hilario employs the same negative “canine\nimperative” construction that Ventura used. On this occasion, however, this\nphrase and the series of utterances in which it is embedded are entangled with\nan earnest nonlinguistic and nonsymbolic effort at communication with the dog.\nWhereas the negative canine imperative—“it will not bite”—responds to the\nchallenge of speaking to the dog in such a way that, under the influence of\nhallucinogens, she can understand but not respond, the reenactment of the act\nof biting Vanessa serves as another form of negative canine imperative, here,\nhowever, not in a symbolic register but in an indexical one. As such, it\nresponds to a different but equally important challenge: how to say “don’t”\nwithout language.\n\nRegarding this challenge of how to say “don’t” without language, Bateson noted\nan interesting feature of communication visible among many mammals, including\ndogs. Their “play” employs a kind of paradox. When, for example, dogs play\ntogether they act as if they are fighting. They bite each other but in ways\nthat are not painful. “The playful nip,” observed Bateson (2000e: 180),\n“denotes the bite, but it does not denote what would be denoted by the bite.”\nThere is a curious logic at work here. It is as if, he continues, these\nanimals were saying, “‘These actions in which we now engage do not denote what\nthose actions for which they stand would denote’” (180). Thinking of this\nsemiotically, and here I follow Deacon (1997: 403–5), whereas negation is\nrelatively simple to communicate in a symbolic register, it is quite difficult\nto do so in the indexical communicative modalities typical of nonhuman\ncommunication. How do you tell a dog not to bite when the only secure modes of\ncommunication available are via likeness and contiguity? How do you negate a\nresemblance or a relation of contiguity without stepping outside of strictly\niconic and indexical forms of reference? Saying “don’t” symbolically is\nsimple. Because the symbolic realm has a level of detachment from indexical\nand iconic chains of semiotic associations it easily lends itself to meta-\nstatements of this sort. That is, via symbolic modalities it is relatively\neasy to negate a statement at a “higher” interpretive level. But how do you\nsay “don’t” indexically? The only way to do so is to re-create the “indexical”\nsign but this time without its indexical effect. The only way to indexically\nconvey the pragmatic negative canine imperative, “Don’t bite” (or, in its Runa\ntrans-species pidgin deferential form, “It will not bite”), is to reproduce\nthe act of biting but in a way that is detached from its usual indexical\nassociations. The playful dog nips. This “bite” is an index of a real bite,\nbut it is so in a paradoxical way. Although it is an index of a real bite and\nall its real effects, it also forces a break in an otherwise transitive\nindexical chain. Because of the absence of a bite, a new relational space\nemerges, which we can call “play.” The nip is an index of a bite but not an\nindex of what that bite is itself an index. By re-creating the attack on my\ncousin, Hilario and Lucio attempted to enter into this canine play logic,\nconstrained as it is, by the formal properties characteristic of indexical\nreference. They forced the dog to bite Vanessa again but this time with her\nsnout tied shut. Theirs was an attempt to rupture the indexical link between\nthe bite and its implications, and in this way to tell their dog “don’t”\nthrough the idiom of a trans-species pidgin that, for the moment, has gone\nwell beyond language.\n\nIt is never entirely clear whether and to what extent animals can understand\nhuman speech. If dogs could readily understand humans there would be no need\nto give them hallucinogens. The point I wish to make is that trans-species\npidgins really are middle grounds (sensu White 1991; see also Conklin and\nGraham 1995). It is not enough to imagine how animals speak, or to attribute\nhuman speech to them. We are also confronted by, and forced to respond to, the\nconstraints imposed by the particular characteristics of the semiotic\nmodalities animals use to communicate among themselves. Regardless of its\nsuccess, this attempt reveals a sensitivity on the part of people in Ávila to\nthe formal constraints (see Deacon 2003) of a nonsymbolic semiotic modality.\n\nTHE CONUNDRUM\n\nI want to return for a moment to the discussion, from this book’s\nintroduction, taken up again in the previous chapter, of the admonition to\nnever look away from a jaguar encountered in the forest. Returning the\njaguar’s gaze encourages this creature to treat you as an equal predator—a\nYou, a Thou. If you look away, it may well treat you as prey, soon-to-be dead\nmeat, an It. Here too, in this nonlinguistic exchange, status is conveyed\nacross species lines through the use of either direct or oblique modes of\nnonlinguistic communication. This too is a parameter of the zone in which\ncanine imperatives operate. Jaguars and humans, then, enjoy a sort of parity\naccording to people in Ávila. They can potentially entertain each other’s gaze\nin a trans-species but nevertheless, to some extent at least, intersubjective\nspace. For this reason some people maintain that if they eat lots of hot\npeppers they can repulse the jaguars they might encounter in the forest\nbecause eye contact will burn the jaguar’s eyes. By contrast, eye contact with\nbeings of higher levels is prohibitively dangerous. One should, for example,\navoid such contact with the demons (supaiguna) that wander the forest. Looking\nat them causes death; by entertaining their gaze one enters their realm—that\nof the nonliving.[28](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn28)\n\nIn Ávila this sort of hierarchy of perspective is reflected in modes of\ncommunication. Literal communication takes place when one being can entertain\nthe subjective viewpoint of the other. “Higher” beings can readily do this\nvis-à-vis lower ones, as is evident by the fact that people can understand dog\n“talk” or that spirits can hear the supplications of people. “Lower” ones,\nhowever, can only see the world from the perspective of higher beings via\nprivileged vehicles of communication, such as hallucinogens, which can permit\ncontact among souls of beings inhabiting different realms. Without special\nvehicles of communication, such as hallucinogens, lower beings understand\nhigher ones only through metaphor, that is, through an idiom that establishes\nconnections at the same time that it differentiates.\n\nWe can now address the conundrum with which I began this chapter: if metaphor\nis so important in Runa dreams and in other situations in which the\ndifferences between kinds of beings are recognized, why do the Runa interpret\nthe dreams of their dogs literally?\n\nIn a metaphoric human dream people recognize a gap between their mode of\nperception and that of the animal masters. Through dreaming, they are able to\nsee how the forest really is—as the domestic gardens and fallows of the\ndominant animal masters. This, however, is always juxtaposed to how they see\nthe forest in their waking life—as wild. People in Ávila interpret dog dreams\nliterally because they are able to see directly the manifestations of how\ntheir dogs’ souls experience events thanks to the privileged status that they\nenjoy vis-à-vis dogs. By contrast, regarding the oneiric ambulations of their\nown souls, which involve interactions with dominant beings and the animals\nunder their control, humans do not usually enjoy this privileged perspective.\nAnd this is why their dreams exhibit a metaphoric gap.\n\nTRANS-SPECIES PIDGINS\n\nIn dog dream interpretation the gaps that separate kinds of beings, gaps that\nare often assiduously respected, collapse, at least for a moment, as dogs and\npeople come together as part of a single affective field that transcends their\nboundaries as species—as they come together, in effect, as an emergent and\nhighly ephemeral self distributed over two bodies.[29](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn29)\nAmériga’s epistemic crisis reveals the tenuous nature but also the stakes of\nsuch a project. Dog dreams do not belong only to dogs. They are also part of\nthe goals, fears, and aspirations of the Runa—the dogs’ masters and occasional\n‘cosmonautical’ companions—as they reach out, through the souls of their dogs,\nto engage with the beings that inhabit the world of the forest and beyond.\n\nThe sorts of entanglements I have discussed in this chapter are more than\ncultural, and yet they are not exactly noncultural either. They are everywhere\nbiological, but they are not just about bodies. Dogs really become human\n(biologically and in historically specific ways) and the Runa really become\npuma; the need to survive encounters with feline semiotic selves requires it.\nThese processes of “becoming with” others change what it means to be alive;\nand they change what it means to be human just as much as they change what it\nmeans to be a dog or even a predator.\n\nWe must be attendant to the danger-fraught, provisional, and highly tenuous\nattempts at communication—in short, the politics—involved in the interactions\namong different kinds of selves that inhabit very different, and often\nunequal, positions. Such attempts are inextricably tied up with questions of\npower. It is because Thou can be spoken when addressing dogs that dogs must,\nat times, be tied up: “Every It is bounded by others.” Negotiating this\ntension between It and Thou that is inherent to living with others is a\nconstant problem as people in Ávila struggle to take a stand “in relation” to\nthe many kinds of other beings that inhabit their cosmos.\n\nRuna-dog trans-species pidgins do more than iconically incorporate dog barks,\nand they do more than invent new human grammars adequate to this risky task of\nspeaking in a way that can be heard across species lines without invoking a\nresponse. They also conform to something more abstract about the referential\npossibilities available to any kind of self, regardless of its status as\nhuman, organic, or even terrestrial,[30](Notes.xhtml#ch4fn30) and this\ninvolves the constraints of certain kinds of semiotic forms. When Hilario\nattempted to say “don’t” without language he could only do so in one way. He\nand his dog fell into a form—one that is instantiated in but also sustains and\nexceeds not only the human but also the animal. It is toward an analysis of\nthese sorts of forms, how they permeate life, how, given the appropriate\nconstraints, they so effortlessly propagate across radically different kinds\nof domains, and how they come to acquire a peculiar social efficacy that I\nturn in the next chapter.\n\n\n![](images/img_0013.jpg)\n\nFIVE\n\n* * *\n\nForm’s Effortless Efficacy\n\nIt is the people who are outside of the monastery who feel its atmosphere.\nThose who are practicing actually do not feel anything.\n\n—Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind\n\nOne night, while staying at Ventura’s house, I dreamed I stood outside of a\npen on a large cattle ranch like the one that belongs to a burly colonist,\nlocated just beyond Ávila territory on the way to Loreto. Inside, a collared\npeccary was running around. Suddenly, it stopped right in front of me. We both\njust stood there, looking at each other. Our intimacy overwhelmed me with a\nstrange and novel feeling, an unexpected sense of resonance with this distant\ncreature. I had an epiphany. I grasped something. I discovered, I think, a\nkind of love for that pig. But I also wanted to kill it. After some fumbling\nwith a broken gun I had borrowed from one of the villagers I finally managed\nto shoot it point-blank. I cradled its limp body in my arms and went back to\nVentura’s house, proud that I would now have plenty of meat to share with his\nfamily.\n\nWhat I dreamed that night is entwined with something that had happened the day\nbefore as Ventura and I were returning from a walk in the forest. Ventura\nsensed something and motioned for me to wait quietly while he ran up ahead to\ninvestigate, cocked gun at the ready. As I waited a collared peccary\napproached me. We both froze, our eyes fixed on each other, before it ran off.\n\nThis experience and its oneiric reverberation captured something about a\nmoment of personal intimacy with a forest being and some of the contradictions\nthat hunting such beings implies. People in Ávila, like many others who live\nin close contact with nonhuman beings, recognize many animals as potential\npersons with whom, on occasion, they have “personal” interactions (see Smuts\n2001). My forest encounter with the peccary that afternoon, however fleeting,\nwas an intimation of the possibility for this kind of trans-species intimacy.\nIt served as a reminder that animals, like us, are selves; they represent the\nworld in certain ways and act on the basis of those representations (see\nchapter 2). Yet hunting requires both recognizing this and treating these\nsingular selves as generic objects; its goal, after all, is to transform them\ninto pieces of meat for consumption and exchange (see chapter 3).\n\nVentura’s take on my dream, however, didn’t emphasize the tension I felt\nbetween recognizing animals as selves and the subsequent desubjectivization\nthat killing them requires. As an experienced hunter Ventura was already adept\nat negotiating this. Instead, he was interested in what this dream had to say\nabout my relationship to the animal’s master—the spirit who owns the pig. Such\nmasters of the beings of the forest are often thought of as European priests\nor powerful white estate owners, like that colonist, with his defiant swagger,\npickup truck, and pigpen, who lives along the way to Loreto.\n\nThese spirit masters are a part of everyday life in Ávila. Ventura himself\nentered their realm when as a child he got lost in the forest. Accompanied by\nhis dog, he was out hunting with his father. As the day wore on Ventura lagged\nfarther and farther behind until boy and dog lost their way. He eventually met\na girl he thought was his sister and followed her down a road that seemed to\nbe taking them home but instead led them through a waterfall to the abode of\nthe masters. After a few days, Ávila shamans, who were able to enter the\nspirit realm with the help of the hallucinogen aya huasca, managed to\nnegotiate Ventura’s release. By this time, however, he and his dog had become\nferal or wild (quita in Quichua). They lost the ability to recognize Ávila\nvillagers as people. The dog failed to bark when called to, and Ventura didn’t\nrecognize, and was even frightened of, his own mother, Rosa.\n\nDecades later, during the time of my stay in Ávila, Ventura’s mother, now\nquite elderly and easily confused, also wound up in the realm of the spirit\nmasters. One day, while caring for some of her grandchildren, Rosa simply\nwandered off into the forest. A full five weeks after her disappearance a\nyoung woman, fishing with her little brother in the forest, stumbled on her by\na stream after first noting that the fish had been scared off by some\npresence. Rosa survived—emaciated, her scalp and toes worm-infested—long\nenough to report how a boy she took to be one of her teenage grandsons led her\nto the underground city of the masters that she called “Quito.” This\nsubterranean city, she said, was beautiful and opulent, “just like the living\nQuito,” Ecuador’s Andean capital.\n\nI never expected to experience this master realm personally. But, according to\nVentura, this is exactly what had happened. That I had dreamed of the peccary\ninside a pen, he explained, indicated that it was the spirit master of the\nanimals that had allowed me to share in that intimate moment of mutual trans-\nspecies recognition the day before. The pig belonged to the spirit master of\nthe forest, and the pen in which I saw it was on that master’s ranch.\n\nIn juxtaposing a certain kind of human sociality with a wild one, my dream was\na lot like one Juanicu’s son Adelmo had. Early one morning Adelmo bolted out\nof bed and announced loudly, “I’ve dreamed!” before grabbing his shotgun and\nrushing out of the house. He returned a few hours later carrying a peccary\nover his shoulders. When I asked him what had prompted him to run out like\nthat he replied that he had dreamed of buying a pair of shoes. The shoe stores\nin Loreto, filled with shelves of shoes and piles of rubber boots, provide an\napt image for the profusion of tracks left by a herd of peccaries at a mud\nwallow. Furthermore, those smelly omnivorous pigs are social beings but not\nexactly in ways that the Runa would deem appropriate. In this regard, they are\nlike one of those Lycra-clad colonist shopkeepers (revealing parts of their\nbodies in ways that no one in Ávila would). They are also like the “naked”\nHuaorani, the longtime “wild” enemies of the “civilized” (and clothed)\nRuna.[1](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn1)\n\nMy dream also shared something in common with one Fabian, a young father of\ntwo, had while we were out at his hunting camp. His was of a well-stocked\ngeneral store filled with things like sacks of rice and cans of sardines and\ntended by a young priest. He later explained that this dream augured killing\nwoolly monkeys. These monkeys travel in troops deep in the mountains, far from\nRuna settlements. Once spotted, they are relatively easy to hunt—usually\nseveral can be taken—and they are coveted for their thick layers of fat. Like\nthe deep forests that these monkeys frequent the well-stocked general stores\nare at some distance from Runa settlements. And, like the monkey troops, the\nstores offer a cornucopia of food. Both the store and the monkey troops are\ncontrolled by powerful whites. Given the proper means, the Runa can have\naccess to some of the wealth of both.\n\nDreams reflect a widespread Amazonian way of seeing human and nonhuman\nsociality as continuous with each other in a manner that also posits a\nrigorous parallel between human domestic realms and nonhuman sylvan ones (see\nDescola 1994). The game birds that the Runa encounter in the forest are really\nthe chickens of the spirit forest masters, just as jaguars are the master’s\nhunting and guard dogs.\n\nWhat we humans see as wild, then, is, from the dominant perspective of the\nmasters, domestic (see chapter 4). In contrast to our Euro-American\nmulticulturalism, which assumes a uniform nature and multiple and variable\nculturally situated representations of it, this Amazonian understanding of the\nforest and its beings is something more akin to what Viveiros de Castro (1998)\ncalls a multinatural one (see chapter 2). There exist many different natures,\nthe products of the bodily dispositions of the different kinds of beings that\ninhabit the universe. But there is only one culture—an I perspective that all\nselves, human and nonhuman alike, inhabit. Culture in this sense is an I\nperspective. That is, from their I perspectives all beings see the different\nnatures they inhabit as cultural: a jaguar—as an I—sees peccary blood as the\nmanioc beer that is the customary staple of the Runa diet, and spirits,\naccording to this same logic, see the forest as an orchard.\n\nWhy this echoing between cultural and natural, domestic and wild? And why\nshould I be privy to it? This is not something multinaturalism can address; an\nanthropology beyond the human can. One might think that the ways in which this\nspecial kind of doubling logic infected my dreams is the by-product of\nsustained ethnographic fieldwork, a sort of enculturation to which eager\nanthropologists might feel susceptible. Except, as I’ve already hinted,\nculture may not be the best marker of difference in these parts of the world.\nIn fact, as I hope the following discussion will illuminate, and following the\nargumentation of chapter 2, difference may not be the right starting point for\nunderstanding the broader problem of relating to which my dream gestures.\n\nMoreover, I wasn’t the only outsider to have experienced these resonances.\nI’ve since discovered that several missionaries and explorers passing through\nthe region have also, apparently spontaneously, become attuned to these same\nsorts of parallels between human and forest realms. For instance, the\nnineteenth-century British explorer Alfred Simson, who stayed briefly in a\nRuna village, described Britain to a man named Marcelino in a way that\nunwittingly re-created the realm of the spirit masters of the forest. He\nmatched up, through a series of isomorphic relations, the urban, opulent,\ndomestic, and white realm of Britain, on the one hand, with the sylvan,\nimpoverished, wild, and Indian one of the Amazon, on the other. Instead of\nvillages scattered through the forest, there are large cities, he explained,\nand in place of scarcity, “knives, axes, beads . . . and all such things were\nto be had there in the greatest profusion.” In his country, he continued,\ninstead of wild beasts there are only useful and edible ones (Simson 1880:\n392–93).[2](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn2)\n\nThe conversation between Simson and Marcelino also hinted at shamanistic\nattempts to commensurate these realms. When the Runa die they go to live\nforever in the realm of the spirit masters, and so it is fitting that Simson\nrefers to Britain as a “paradise.” Access to this realm required an arduous\njourney that, according to Simson, might last some “ten moons”—a journey that,\nwe later learn, Marcelino understood as being of the shamanistic sort. As they\nspoke Simson offered one of his pipes of “strong tobacco,” and Marcelino\nproceeded to swallow “all the smoke he could draw in huge volumes” (1880:\n393).\n\nTobacco, along with the hallucinogen aya huasca, is one of the vehicles that\nhelp people enter the point of view of the masters. In fact, people in Ávila\nrefer to shamans as those “with tobacco” (tabacuyu). And thanks to the\nprivileged access to other points of view that dreaming provides, I too, like\nMarcelino and the aya huasca-drinking Ávila shamans that rescued Ventura and\nhis dog, was able to see the forest as it really is. I came to see it as a\ndomestic space—a ranch—because this is how it appears from the dominant I\nperspective of the spirit master of the forest who owned the pig.\n\nWhy should such a parallel between sylvan and domestic—ecology and\neconomy—appear in so many places, including my dreams? And why would a place\nlike Quito come to be located deep in the forest? The claim I wish to make in\nthis chapter is that addressing these seemingly disparate questions requires\nunderstanding something that might not, on the surface, seem relevant: it\nrequires understanding the peculiar characteristics of regularities, habits,\nor patterns. In more abstract terms, I am arguing that getting at these\nquestions requires an understanding of how certain configurations of\nconstraint on possibility emerge and of the particular manner in which such\nconfigurations propagate in the world in ways that result in a sort of\npattern. That is, addressing these questions requires understanding something\nabout what I call “form.”\n\nThe point I will be fleshing out is this: what encourages Amazonian forest\necologies and human economies to be aligned in my dreams and in those of the\nRuna is the pattern or form that such systems share. And this form, I wish to\nstress, is the result of something other than the imposition of human\ncognitive schema or cultural categories onto these systems.\n\nIt is hard to broach the topic of form beyond the human, as I do here, without\nbeing accused of making a Platonic argument for the separate existence of a\ntranscendent realm of, say, ideal triangles or squares. By contrast, it is\nless controversial to consider the role form plays within the realm of the\nhuman.\n\nThe human mind, we can all agree, traffics in generalities, abstractions, and\ncategories. Another way to say this is that form is central to human thought.\nLet me rephrase this statement in terms of the definition of form I have\nproposed: constraints on possibility emerge with our distinctively human ways\nof thinking, which result in a pattern that I here call form. For example, the\nassociational logic of symbolic reference (treated in chapter 1 and revisited\nlater in this chapter), which is so central to human thought and language,\nresults in the creation of general concepts, such as, say, the word bird.\n\nSuch a general concept is more constrained than the various actual utterances\nof the word bird through which it is instantiated. Utterances, then, are more\nvariable, less constrained, and “messier” than the concept they express. That\nis, there will be great variation in how any particular utterance of a word\nsuch as bird actually sounds. And yet the general concept, to which all of\nthese particular utterances refer, allows these many variable utterances to be\ninterpreted as meaningful instantiations of the concept “bird.” This general\nconcept (sometimes termed a “type”) is more regular, more redundant, simpler,\nmore abstract, and, ultimately, more patterned than the utterances (referred\nto as “tokens” in their relation to such types) that instantiate it. Thinking\nof such concepts in terms of form gets at this characteristic generality that\na type exhibits.\n\nBecause language, with its symbolic properties, is distinctively human, it is\nall too easy to relegate such formal phenomena to human minds. And this\nencourages us to take a nominalist position. It encourages us to think of form\nsolely as something humans impose on a world otherwise devoid of pattern,\ncategory, or generality. (And if we are anthropologists it encourages us to\nsearch for the origins of such categories in the distinctively human\nhistorically contingent, changing social and cultural contexts in which we are\nimmersed; see chapter 1.) But taking such a position would be tantamount to\nallowing human language to colonize our thinking (see introduction and\nchapters 1 and 2). Given that, as I argued in previous chapters, human\nlanguage is nested within a broader representational field made up of semiotic\nprocesses that emerge in and circulate in the nonhuman living world,\nprojecting language onto this nonhuman world blinds us to these other\nrepresentational modalities and their characteristics.\n\nThe human, then, is only one source of form. It is important to note, for the\nargument at hand, that an important characteristic that these semiotic\nmodalities that exist beyond the human exhibit is that they too possess formal\nproperties. That is, as with symbolic representation, these semiotic\nmodalities (those made up of icons and indices) also exhibit constraints on\npossibility that result in a certain pattern.\n\nI alluded to this at the end of the previous chapter in my discussion of the\nlimited ways in which one can attempt to “say” “don’t” in a nonsymbolic,\nnonlinguistic, register and how the logic of this formal constraint on\npossibility is also manifested in a pattern of nonhuman animal communication—a\nform—that is visible in animal “play.” That this pattern recurs time and again\nin many different species, and even in attempts at communication that cross\nspecies lines, is an example of the emergence and circulation of form in the\nworld beyond the human.\n\nAs I mentioned in chapter 1, that semiosis exists beyond human minds and the\ncontexts they create is one indicator that “generals,” that is, habits, or\nregularities, or, in Peircean terms, “thirds,” are “real.” (By “real” here, I\nmean that such generals can come to manifest themselves in ways that are\nindependent of humans, and they can come to have eventual effects in the\nworld.) However—and this is key—whereas semiosis is in and of the living world\nbeyond the human, form emerges from and is part and parcel of the nonliving\none as well.\n\nThat is, form is a sort of general real despite the fact that it is neither\nalive nor a kind of thought. This can be hard to appreciate given the ways in\nwhich life and thought harness form and are everywhere made over by its logics\nand properties. So in this chapter I am taking anthropology a step further\nbeyond the human to explore the way in which a particular manifestation of a\ngeneral exists in the world beyond life.\n\nThroughout this book, especially in chapter 1, I have been discussing a number\nof generals. Emergent phenomena are generals. Habits or regularities are\ngenerals. All of these, in some way or another, are the result of constraints\non possibility (see Deacon 2012). I am using the term form to refer to the\nparticular manifestations of the generals I treat here. I do so to emphasize\nsome of the geometrical patternings involved in the ways generals become\nexpressed in the Amazon. Many of these could be classed as self-organizing\nemergent phenomena, or in Deacon’s (2006, 2012) terms, “morphodynamic”—that\nis, characterized by dynamics that generate form (see chapter 1).\n\nExamples of such nonliving emergent forms in the Amazon include, as I will\ndiscuss, the patterned distribution of rivers or the recurrent circular shapes\nof the whirlpools that sometimes form in them. Each of these nonliving forms\nis the product of constraints on possibility. Regarding rivers, water doesn’t\njust flow anywhere in the Amazon. Rather, the distribution of rivers is\nconstrained by a variety of factors, which results in a pattern. Regarding\nwhirlpools, under the right conditions swift currents moving around\nobstructions create self-reinforcing circular patterns that are a subset of\nall the possible (messier, less constrained, more turbulent) ways in which\nwater might otherwise flow.\n\nIn recognizing the emergence of form in the physical world, then, this chapter\nrequires an excursion beyond the living. The goal, however, is to see what it\nis that the living “do” with form and the particular ways in which what they\ndo with it is infected by form’s strange logics and properties. As I will\nshow, humans in the Amazon harness such forms, and so do other kinds of living\nbeings.\n\nForm, then, is crucial to lives, human and otherwise. Nevertheless, the\nworkings of this vague entity remain largely undertheorized in anthropological\nanalysis. This, in large part, is due to the fact that form lacks the\ntangibility of a standard ethnographic object. Nevertheless, form, like the\nbasic intentionality of the pig and the palpable materiality of its meat, is\nsomething real. Indeed, its particular mode of efficacy will require us to\nthink again what we mean by the “real.” If, as anthropologists, we can find\nways to attend ethnographically to those processes of form amplification and\nharnessing as they play out in the Amazon, we might be able to become better\nattuned to the strange ways in which form moves through us. This, in turn, can\nhelp us harness form’s logics and properties as a conceptual tool that might\neven help us rethink our very idea of what it means to think.\n\nRUBBER\n\nTo get a better handle on form, I’d like to turn to another forest/city\njuxtaposition, not unlike Rosa’s Quito-in-the-forest or Marcelino’s Britain.\nManuela Carneiro da Cunha (1998) has described how a Jaminaua shamanic\nnovitiate of the Juruá River system of Amazonian Brazil traveled vast\ndistances downriver to apprentice in the port cities on the Amazon itself, in\norder to be recognized as a powerful shaman upon returning to his village. To\nunderstand why these port cities have come to be the conduits for indigenous\nshamanic empowerment, we need to understand something of a momentous period in\nAmazonian history: the rubber boom, which began in the late nineteenth century\nand reached into the second decade of the twentieth, and the particular kinds\nof isomorphic correspondences that made this boom possible in the first place.\n\nIn many respects the rubber boom that swept through the Amazon was the product\nof a variety of techno-scientific, “natural-cultural,” and imperial\nconjunctures. That is, the discovery of vulcanization coupled with the\ninvention and mass production of automobiles and other machines catapulted\nrubber onto an international market. For the Upper Amazon this boom was a sort\nof second conquest, given that outsiders were dependent, for the most part, on\nexploiting local populations to extract this increasingly valuable commodity\nthat was dispersed throughout the forest. The boom, however, ended abruptly\nafter rubber seedlings, which had been removed from the Amazon basin by\nBritish naturalists, began to take hold in Southeast Asian plantations (see\nBrockway 1979; Hemming 1987; Dean 1987). This story, told in terms of such\ninteractions among humans, and even among human and nonhuman beings, is well\nknown. Here, I want to discuss something not often noticed: namely, the ways\nin which the peculiar properties of form mediated all these interactions and\nmade this extractive economic system possible.\n\nLet me explain what I mean. Rubber falls into a form. That is, there is a\nspecific configuration of constraints on the possible distribution of rubber\ntrees. The distribution of rubber trees throughout the Amazon forests—whether\nthe preferred Hevea brasiliensis or a few other latex-producing taxa—conforms\nto a specific pattern: individual rubber trees are widely dispersed throughout\nthe forest across vast stretches of the landscape. Plant species that are\nwidely dispersed stand a better chance of surviving attacks from species-\nspecific pathogens,[3](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn3) such as, in the case of H.\nbrasiliensis, the fungal parasite Microcyclus ulei, which causes the disease\nknown as South American leaf blight. Because this parasite is endemic\nthroughout rubber’s natural range, rubber could not be easily cultivated in\nhigh-density plantations there (Dean 1987: 53–86). An interaction with this\nparasite results in a particular pattern of rubber distribution. Individual\nrubber trees are, for the most part, widely and evenly distributed and not\nclumped in single-species stands. The result is that rubber “explores,” or\ncomes to occupy, landscape in a way that manifests a specific pattern. Any\nattempt to exploit rubber in situ must recognize this.[4](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn4)\n\nThe distribution of water throughout the Amazonian landscape also conforms to\na specific pattern or form. This has a variety of causes. Due to a number of\nglobal climactic, geographic, and biological factors, there is a lot of water\nin the Amazon basin. Furthermore, water only flows in one direction: downhill.\nThus small creeks flow into larger streams, which in turn flow into small\nrivers that flow into larger ones, and this pattern repeats itself until the\nenormous Amazon disgorges into the Atlantic Ocean (see figure 1, on page 4).\n\nFor largely unrelated reasons there exist, then, two patterns or forms: the\ndistribution of rubber throughout the landscape and the distribution of\nwaterways. These regularities happen to explore landscape in the same way.\nTherefore, wherever there is a rubber tree it is likely that nearby there will\nbe a stream that leads to a river.\n\nBecause these patterns happen to explore landscape in the same way, following\none can lead to the other. The Amazon rubber economy exploited and relied on\nthe similarities these patterns share. By navigating up the river network to\nfind rubber and then floating the rubber downstream, it linked these patterns\nsuch that these physical and biological domains became united in an economic\nsystem that exploited them thanks to the formal similarities they share.\n\nHumans are not the only ones who link floristic and riverine distribution\npatterns. The fish known in Ávila as quiruyu,[5](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn5) for\nexample, eats fruits of the aptly named tree quiruyu\nhuapa[6](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn6) when these fall into rivers. This fish, in\neffect, uses rivers to get at this resource. In doing so it also potentially\npropagates the patterned similarities—the form—that floristic and riverine\ndistributions share. If in eating these fruits the fish were to disperse its\nseeds along the course of the river, then the pattern of this plant’s\ndistribution would come to match that of the rivers even more closely.\n\nThe Amazon riverine network exhibits an additional regularity crucial to the\nway rubber was harnessed via form: self-similarity across scale. That is, the\nbranching of creeks is like the branching of streams, which is like the\nbranching of rivers. As such, it resembles the compound ferns that people in\nÁvila call chichinda, which also exhibit self-similarity across scale. Chinda\nrefers to a haphazard pile, especially to a tangled mass of driftwood such as\nthe kind that might snag around the base of a riverbank tree after a flood. By\nreduplicating a part of this word—chi-chinda—this plant name captures how in a\ncompound fern the pattern of divisions of the frond at one level is the same\nas that of the next higher-order level of divisions. Chichinda, which alludes\nto a tangled mass nested within another tangled mass, captures this fern’s\nself-similarity across scale; a pattern at one level is nested within the same\npattern at a higher more inclusive one.\n\nThe river network’s self-similarity is also unidirectional. Smaller rivers\nflow into larger ones, and water becomes increasingly concentrated across an\never smaller expanse of landscape as one moves down the hydrographic network.\nDa Cunha (1998: 10–11) has highlighted a curious phenomenon in the Juruá River\nbasin during the rubber boom period. A vast network of creditor-debt relations\nemerged, which assumed a nested self-similar repeating pattern across scale\nthat was isomorphic with the river network. A rubber merchant located at one\nconfluence of rivers extended credit upriver and was in turn in debt to the\nmore powerful merchant located downriver at the next confluence. This nested\npattern linked indigenous communities in the deepest forests to rubber barons\nat the mouth of the Amazon and even in Europe.\n\nHumans, however, are not the only ones who harness the unidirectionally nested\nriverine pattern. Amazon river dolphins, like traders, also congregate at the\nconfluences of rivers (Emmons 1990; McGuire and Winemiller 1998). They feed on\nthe fish that accumulate there due to this nested characteristic of the river\nnetwork.\n\nBeing inside form is effortless. Its causal logic is in this sense quite\ndifferent from the push-and-pull logic we usually associate with the physical\neffort needed to do something. Rubber floated downstream will eventually get\nto the port. And yet a great amount of work was required to get rubber into\nthis form. It took great skill and effort to find the trees, extract and then\nprepare the latex into bundles, and then carry these to the nearest\nstream.[7](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn7) More to the point, it took great coercive force\nto get others to do these things. During the rubber boom, Ávila, like many\nother Upper Amazonian villages, was raided by rubber bosses looking for slave\nlabor (Oberem 1980: 117; Reeve 1988).\n\nIt is not surprising that villages such as Ávila should attract the attention\nof rubber bosses, for their inhabitants were already adept at harnessing\nforest forms to get at resources. Just as rubber tapping involves harnessing\nthe riverine form to get at trees, hunting involves harnessing form. Because\nof the high species diversity and local rarity of species and the lack of any\none fruiting season, the fruits that animals eat are highly dispersed in both\nspace and time (Schaik, Terborgh, and Wright 1993). This means that at any\ngiven time there will exist a different geometrical constellation of fruiting\nresources that attracts animals. Fruit-eating animals amplify this\nconstellation’s pattern. For they are not only attracted to fruiting trees but\noften also to the increased safety provided by foraging in a multispecies\nassociation. Each member “contributes” its species-specific abilities to\ndetect predators—resulting in a greater overall group awareness of potential\ndanger (Terborgh 1990; Heymann and Buchanan-Smith 2000: esp. 181). That\npredators, in turn, are attracted to this concentration of animals further\namplifies the pattern of distribution of life across the forest landscape.\nThis results in a particular pattern of potential game meat: a clustered,\nshifting, highly ephemeral and localized concentration of animals interspersed\nby vast areas of relative emptiness. Ávila hunters, then, don’t hunt animals\ndirectly. Rather, they seek to discover and harness the ephemeral form created\nby the particular spatial distribution or configuration of those tree species\nthat are fruiting at any given point in time because this is what attracts\nanimals.[8](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn8)\n\n![](images/img_0014.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7. Rubber-boom-era hunters-of-hunters. Courtesy of the Whiffen\nCollection, Museum of Archeology and Anthropology, Cambridge University.\n\nHunters, those already adept at harnessing forest forms, make ideal rubber\ntappers. But to get them to do this often meant hunting these hunters like\nanimals. Rubber bosses often enlisted members of hostile indigenous groups to\ndo it. In an image reproduced by Michael Taussig (1987: 48) of such hunters-\nof-hunters in the Putumayo region of the Colombian Amazon it is no coincidence\nthat the man in the foreground is wearing jaguar canines and white clothing\n(see figure 7).\n\nBy adopting the bodily habitus of a predatory jaguar and a dominant white (a\nclassic multinatural perspectival shamanistic strategy; see chapter 2), he can\ncome to see the Indians he hunts as both prey and underlings. Those hunters-\nof-hunters that Taussig writes about were referred to as “muchachos”—boys—a\nreminder of the fact that they too were subservient to someone else: the white\nbosses. The rubber economy amplified an existing hierarchical trophic pattern\nof predation (with carnivores, such as jaguars, “above” the herbivores, such\nas deer, that they prey on), and in the process this economy combined this\npattern with a paternalistic colonial one.\n\nÁvila, as I mentioned, was by no means safe from slave raiding. In fact, one\nof the first stories Amériga told me on my initial trip to Ávila in 1992 was\nof how, as a child, her own grandmother was spared from slavery by being\nunceremoniously pushed out through the back bamboo wall of her house just as\nthe raiders arrived at the front door. Ávila, in the foothills of the Andes,\nis far away from the navigable rivers and high-quality sources of rubber.\nHevea brasiliensis, which produces the best rubber, doesn’t grow near Ávila.\nNevertheless, through great coercive effort many Ávila inhabitants were pushed\ninto the rubber economy’s form. They were forcibly relocated far downriver on\nthe Napo in what is now Peru, and even beyond, where navigable rivers and\nrubber trees were abundant. Almost none returned.[9](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn9)\n\nThe rubber boom economy was able to exist and grow because it united a series\nof partially overlapping forms, such as predatory chains, plant and animal\nspatial configurations, and hydrographic networks, by linking the similarities\nthese share. The result was that all these more basic regularities came to be\npart of an overarching form—an exploitative political-economic structure whose\ngrasp was very difficult to escape.\n\nIn fact, this form created the conditions of possibility for the political\nrelations that emerged. Shamans, those experts at stepping into dominant\npoints of view within a multinatural perspectival system of cosmic predation,\nharnessed it to gain power. By apprenticing downriver the Jaminaua shaman was\nable to adopt a perspective that encompassed and exceeded the viewpoints of\nthe social actors upstream (da Cunha 1998: 12). Being downriver means\ninhabiting a more inclusive level of the river pattern’s nested self-\nsimilarity—a form that had now become socially important thanks to a colonial\neconomy that linked it to the forest and to its indigenous\ninhabitants.[10](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn10) What is more, Amazonian shamanism cannot\nbe understood outside of the colonial hierarchy that in part created it and to\nwhich it responds (see Gow 1996; Taussig 1987). However, shamanism is not just\na product of colonialism. Shamanism and colonial extraction are equally caught\nup, constrained by, and forced to harness a shared form that partially exceeds\nthem.\n\nEMERGENT FORMS\n\nForms, such as the pattern that brings rubber trees, rivers, and economies\ninto relation with one another, are emergent. By “emergent,” I don’t just mean\nnew or indeterminate or complex. Rather, with reference to my discussion in\nchapter 1, I mean the appearance of unprecedented relational properties, which\nare not reducible to any of the more basic component parts that give rise to\nthem.\n\nForm, as an emergent property, makes itself manifest in the physical landscape\nof the Amazon. Take, for example, whirlpools, such as those that sometimes\narise in Amazonian rivers, which I discussed earlier in this book and in the\nintroduction to this chapter. Such whirlpools possess novel properties with\nrespect to the rivers in which they appear; namely, they come to exhibit a\ncoordinated circular pattern of moving water. This circular pattern in which\nthe water in a whirlpool flows is more constrained and thus simpler than the\notherwise freer, more turbulent, and hence less patterned flow of water in the\nrest of the river.\n\nThe whirlpool’s circular form emerges from the river’s water, and this is a\nphenomenon that cannot be reduced to the contingent histories that give that\nwater its specific characteristics. Let me explain. Any given unit of water\nflowing through the Amazonian watershed certainly has a particular history\nassociated with it. That is, it is, in a sense, affected by its past. It\nflowed through a particular landscape and it acquired different attributes as\na result. Such histories—where the water came from, what happened to it\nthere—certainly give different Amazonian rivers their specific\ncharacteristics. If, for example, the water flowing into a particular river\npassed through nutrient-poor white-sand soils, that river’s water would become\ntannin-rich (see chapter 2), and hence dark, translucent, and acidic. However,\nand crucially for the argument at hand, such histories do not explain or\npredict the form the whirlpool will take in such rivers. Under the right\nconditions a circular shape will emerge regardless of the particular histories\nof where the water in the rivers came from.\n\nImportantly, however, the conditions that result in the emergence of a\nwhirlpool include the continuous flow of water. So the novel form a whirlpool\ntakes is never fully separable from the water from which it emerges: block the\nriver’s flow, and the form will disappear.\n\nAnd yet the whirlpool is something other than the continuous flow, which it\nrequires. That something other is also something less. And this “something\nless” is why it makes sense to think of emergent entities such as a whirlpool\nin terms of form. As I mentioned, water flowing through a whirlpool does so in\na way that is less free when compared to all the various less coordinated ways\nin which water otherwise moves through a river. This redundancy—this something\nless—is what results in the circular pattern of flow we associate with\nwhirlpools. It is what accounts for its form.\n\nIn being both different from and continuous with that from which they come,\nand on which they depend, whirlpools are like other emergent phenomena, such\nas, for example, symbolic reference. Symbolic reference, recall from chapter\n1, emerges out of those other more basic semiotic modalities within which it\nis nested. Like a whirlpool and its relationship to the water flowing in the\nriver, symbolic reference exhibits new emergent properties with respect to the\nicons and indices on which it depends and from which it comes.\n\nThis characteristic of disjuncture-despite-continuity that appears with\nwhirlpools also applies to the emergent pattern visible in the rubber economy.\nThe disparate causes responsible for rubber and river distributions become\nirrelevant once an economic system unites them by virtue of the regularities\nthat rubber and rivers share. And yet such an economy is everywhere,\nobviously, dependent on rubber. And it is also dependent on the rivers used to\naccess that rubber.\n\nEmergent phenomena, then, are nested. They enjoy a level of detachment from\nthe lower order processes out of which they arise. And yet their existence is\ndependent on lower-order conditions. This goes in one direction: whirlpools\ndisappear when riverbed conditions change, but riverbeds do not depend on\nwhirlpools for their persistence. Similarly, the Amazon rubber economy was\nwholly dependent for its existence on the ways in which parasites such as the\nSouth American leaf blight constrained rubber’s distribution. Once rubber\nplantations in Southeast Asia—far removed from these parasites—began to\nproduce latex, this crucial constraint responsible for the patterned\ndistribution of rubber trees disappeared. An entirely different economic\narrangement became possible, and, like a fleeting whirlpool, the emergent\nform, the political-economic system that united rubber, rivers, natives, and\nbosses, vanished.\n\nThe biosocial efficacy of form lies in part in the way it both exceeds and is\ncontinuous with its component parts. It is continuous in the sense that\nemergent patterns are always connected to lower-level energetics and\nmaterialities. And the materialities—say, fish, meat, fruits, or rubber—are\nwhat living selves, be they dolphins, hunters, fruit-eating fish, or rubber\nbosses, are trying to access when they harness form. Form also exceeds these\nin the sense that as these patterns become linked their similarities propagate\nacross very different kinds of domains: the regularities through which rubber\nis harnessed cross from the physical to the biological to the human.\n\nIn this process by which forms come to be combined at higher levels, however,\nthe higher-order emergent pattern also acquires properties specific to\nantecedent ones. The rubber boom economy was nested like the rivers and\npredatory like portions of the tropical food chain. It captured something of\nthese other-than-human forms. But it also integrated them into an emergent\nform that is, in addition, all too human (see chapter 4). Let me explain. The\nnonhuman forms I’ve been discussing here—those, for example, that involve\nnesting and predation—are hierarchical without being moral. It makes no sense\nto downplay the importance of hierarchical forms in the nonhuman world. This\nis not the way to ground our moral thinking, because such forms are not in any\nway moral. Hierarchy takes on a moral aspect in all-too-human worlds only\nbecause morality is an emergent property of the symbolic semiosis distinctive\nto humans (see chapter 4). Although themselves beyond the moral and hence\namoral (i.e., nonmoral), such hierarchical patterns nonetheless get caught up\nin systems with all-too-human emergent properties—systems such as the highly\nexploitative economy based on rubber extraction, whose moral valence is not\nreducible to the more basic formal alignments of hierarchical patterns on\nwhich it depended.\n\nTHE MASTERS OF THE FOREST\n\nBut why, returning to Ávila and my dream, is it that the realm of the spirit\nmasters unites hunting in the forest with the larger political economy and\ncolonial history in which the Runa are also immersed? What, in short, does it\nmean to say that these spirit masters of the forest are also “white”?\n\nWhiteness is just one element in a series of partially overlapping\nhierarchical correspondences that are superimposed in the spirit realm of the\nmasters of the forest. For instance, each mountain around Ávila is owned and\ncontrolled by a different spirit master. The most powerful of these lives in\nan underground “Quito” located inside Sumaco Volcano, the region’s highest\npeak. This volcano also lends its name to the early-sixteenth-century\njurisdiction, the provincia de Sumaco, in recognition of the paramount chief\nto whom all regional subchiefs owed allegiance before this area succumbed to\ncolonial rule and came to be known by the Spanish name\nÁvila.[11](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn11) Lesser forest masters live in cities and\nvillages that are likened to the smaller towns and cities that make up the\nparish and provincial seats of Ecuador’s Amazonian provinces. These correspond\nto the region’s smaller mountains. The masters living in these stand in the\nsame relation to the master living in the underground Quito as the pre-\nHispanic and early colonial subchiefs stood to the paramount chief associated\nwith Sumaco Volcano.\n\nThis mapping of pre-Hispanic and contemporary administrative hierarchies onto\na topographic one partially overlaps with the network of estates or haciendas\nthat dominated the local extractive resource economy until recent times and\narticulated that economy to Quito. The realm of the spirit masters is also a\nbustling productive estate, like the great rubber-boom–era haciendas along the\nNapo River.[12](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn12) And the masters travel to and from their\npastures and fallows, shuttling game animals in their pickup trucks and\nairplanes. Hilario, who many years ago climbed to the top of Sumaco Volcano\nwith a crew of army engineers intent on erecting a relay antenna there,\nreported that the gullies he saw emanating radially from its sugar cone summit\nare the highways of the masters. In the same way that roads originate in Quito\nand from there extend throughout Ecuador, all the major rivers of the greater\nÁvila region originate from this mountaintop.\n\nIt is my contention that the realm of the spirit masters superimposes ethnic,\npre-Hispanic, colonial, and postcolonial hierarchies on the landscape because\nall of these various sociopolitical arrangements are subject to similar\nconstraints regarding how certain biotic resources can be mobilized across\nspace. That is, if Amazonian household economies and broader national and even\nglobal ones attempt to capture bits of the living wealth that the forest\nhouses—whether in the form of game, rubber, or other floristic products—they\ncan only do so by accessing the conjunction of physical and biotic patternings\nin which this wealth is caught up.[13](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn13) As I’ve mentioned,\nhunters, for the most part, don’t hunt animals directly; they harness the\nforms that attract animals. In a similar fashion, estate owners, through debt\npeonage, and during certain periods even outright enslavement, collected\nforest products via the Runa. This extractive pattern creates a clustered\ndistribution. Like the pattern of fruiting trees that attracts animals,\nhaciendas came to be nodes where forest resources and the city ones with which\nthey were commensurated became concentrated. It is the hacienda that harbored\nthe “greatest profusion” of “knives, axes, and beads” (Simson 1880: 392–93),\nand it is the hacienda that accumulated the forest products that the Runa, in\nturn, exchanged for these. Cities, like Quito, also exhibit this clumped\npattern of wealth accumulation, insofar as these are both the sources of trade\ngoods and the end points for forest products.\n\nThe lowland Runa had an intimate and yet fraught relationship to Quito and its\nwealth. They were sometimes charged with the task of carrying whites on their\nbacks to this city (Muratorio 1987). And in the days when Ávila was\nconsiderably more isolated from markets its inhabitants would go directly to\nQuito, making the eight-day trek, along with their forest products, in the\nhope of exchanging their goods for some of the wealth that the city harbored.\n\nIn the higher-order emergent realm of the spirit masters of the forest,\nhunting, estates, and cities align with each other by virtue of the\nsimilarities they share regarding their relations to the patterns of resource\ndistribution that exist around them. Hierarchy is crucial to form propagation\nacross these different domains. Spirit realms unite these various overlapping\nforms at a “higher” emergent level in the same way that the rubber economy is\nat a “higher” level than the patterns of rubber trees and rivers it unites.\nHow form is amplified in human domains clearly is the contingent product of\nall-too-human histories. And yet hierarchy itself is also a kind of form,\nwhich has unique properties that exceed the contingencies of earthly bodies\nand histories, even if it is only instantiated in\nthese.[14](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn14)\n\nSEMIOTIC HIERARCHY\n\nThis interplay between the logical formal properties of hierarchy and the\ncontingent ways in which it comes to acquire a moral valence is visible in\nthose trans-species pidgins, discussed in the previous chapter, through which\nthe Runa attempt to understand and communicate with other beings. The\nhierarchy involved in trans-species communication clearly has a colonial\ninflection; that’s why I call them pidgins. As discussed in chapter 4, dogs,\nfor example, often occupy the same structural position vis-à-vis the Runa as\nthe Runa do vis-à-vis whites. Recall that although some Runa turn into\npowerful jaguars when they die, as jaguars they also become the dogs of the\nwhite spirit masters. These sorts of colonial hierarchies, however, are the\nmorally loaded emergent amplifications of more fundamental nonhuman ones that\nare devoid of any moral valence.\n\nMany of these more fundamental hierarchies involve the nested and\nunidirectional properties inherent to semiosis. To recapitulate from chapter\n1, and to further develop something I alluded to above, symbolic reference,\nthat distinctively human semiotic modality, which is based on conventional\nsigns, has emergent semiotic properties with respect to the more basic iconic\nand indexical referential strategies (i.e., those that involve signs of\nlikeness and contiguity, respectively) that we humans share with all other\nlife-forms. These three representational modalities are hierarchically nested\nand connected. Indices, which form the basis for communication in the\nbiological world, are the product of higher-order relations among icons, and\nas such they have novel, emergent referential properties with respect to\nicons. Similarly, symbols are the product of higher-order relations among\nindices, also with novel emergent properties with respect to indices. This\nonly goes in one direction. Symbolic reference requires indices, but indexical\nreference does not need symbols.\n\nThese emergent hierarchical properties that make human language (based as it\nis on symbolic reference) a distinctive semiotic modality also structure the\nways in which people in Ávila differentiate between animal and human realms.\nLet me illustrate this with an exchange that took place between Luisa, Delia,\nAmériga, and a squirrel cuckoo. This exchange took place not long after the\nfamily’s dog Huiqui had returned from the forest badly wounded by a jaguar.\nThis example shows the role that hierarchy plays, particularly as it\nstructures the perceived distinction between levels of meanings in different\nsemiotic registers. Animal vocalizations, taken at face value as “utterances,”\nare at one level of significance, whereas the more general “human” messages\nthat these vocalizations might also contain can emerge at another, higher\nlevel.\n\nWhen the exchange in question took place the women had just returned from\ncollecting fish poison in their transitional orchards and fallows. They were\nat home, sipping beer, peeling manioc, and still uncertain about the fate of\nthe other two dogs. We had not yet gone out to search for them and did not yet\nknow that they had been killed by a jaguar, although at this point this is\nwhat the women thought had happened, and that scenario provided the\ninterpretive frame for the conversation they were having.\n\nAs the women talked they were abruptly interrupted by a squirrel cuckoo\ncalling “shicuá’” as it flew over the house. Immediately afterward, Luisa and\nAmériga simultaneously interjected the following:\n\nLuisa: | Amériga:  \n---|---  \nshicuá’ | “Shicúhua,” it says  \n  \nThe squirrel cuckoo, known in Ávila as shicúhua, has a variable call. If you\nhear it calling “ti’ ti’ ti’,” as people in Ávila imitate one of its\nvocalizations, it is said to be “speaking well” and what you are at the moment\ndesiring will come to pass. However, if you should hear it making the call we\nheard that day as the bird flew overhead, a vocalization that people in Ávila\nimitate as “shicuá’,” that which you think will happen will not come to be and\nthe bird is therefore said to be “lying.” Other animals, I should note, call\nin similar ways. The pygmy anteater, known by the related name shicúhua\nindillama, makes an ominous hiss that portends that a relative will die.\n\nImportantly, however, neither this hiss nor the squirrel cuckoo’s call shicuá’\nin and of itself is a prophetic sign. Rather, although these vocalizations can\ncertainly be treated on their own as signs, they only acquire their particular\nsignificance as a sort of omen when they are interpreted to be manifestations\nof the Quichua word Shicúhua. The word Shicúhua, pronounced with attention to\nthe tendency in Quichua toward penultimate stress, not the cuckoo’s squawk\nshicuá’ or the pygmy anteater’s hiss, is what causes these otherwise\nmeaningful vocalizations to be treated, in addition, as portents.\n\nThis difference between the squirrel cuckoo’s squawk shicuá’ and Shicúhua,\nwhich is what this bird is said to be “saying” in making this vocalization, is\nimportant. As the squirrel cuckoo flew overhead Luisa imitated its call as she\nheard it: “shicuá’.” Amériga, by contrast, quoted it: “‘Shicúhua,’ it says.”\nIn the process, Amériga also pronounced the call in a way that was less\nfaithful to the sound the bird actually made and more in keeping with the\nstress patterns in Quichua.[15](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn15)\n\nWhereas Luisa imitated what she heard, and thus constrained herself to the\nutterance as instance, Amériga tried to get at what the bird was “saying” more\ngenerally. She was in effect interpreting the message within “human language,”\nwhich, I should note, is the literal meaning of runa shimi, the Quichua name\nfor what the Runa speak. As such, she treated it as standing to the “token”\nanimal utterance as a “type.” Let me illustrate by virtue of an English\nexample. In English any particular utterance of, say, “bird” is taken as an\ninstantiation—or token—of the word Bird, which stands to it as a general\nconcept—or type. My point is that something similar is going on here. Amériga\ntreated the squirrel cuckoo’s squawk as an instantiation of a sort of species-\nspecific token of the “human” word Shicúhua, which stands to this squawk as a\ntype. And just as we can interpret any utterance of “bird” by virtue of its\nrelation to the word Bird in English, so too Amériga interpreted this animal\nvocalization as being an instance of a more general “human” word, Shicúhua. As\nsuch this vocalization is now understood to carry a particular message.\nSpecies-specific vocalizations (whether the squirrel cuckoo’s squawk or the\npygmy anteater’s hiss) can act as individual tokens of more general terms in\nthe “human” language Quichua, which serve as their types.\n\nI want to emphasize that it is not that the squawk in and of itself is\nnecessarily meaningless; it can still be interpreted by humans (and others) as\nan indexical sign. But it acquires its additional meaning as a particular kind\nof omen in a specific divinatory system when it is seen as being an instance\nof something more general.\n\nTo treat this squawk as meaningful at this level—to treat it as an\nomen—Amériga brought the squirrel cuckoo’s call into language. The squawk\nshicuá’ became legible as an instantiation of Shicúhua. Understood as a\nmanifestation of “human language” this call (which might otherwise be\nindexically meaningful) now carried with it an additional prophetic message in\na symbolic register.\n\nAnd the women acted on this. The operative assumption that until now had been\nguiding the conversation—that the dogs had been killed—was now, it seemed,\nwrong. Amériga, accordingly, reinterpreted the dogs’ plight within the new\nframework of assumptions suggested by the call. Heeding the cuckoo’s message,\nshe now imagined an alternative scenario that would explain why the dogs\nhadn’t come home yet: “Having eaten a coati,” she conjectured, “they’re out\nthere wandering around with their bellies full.”[16](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn16)\nDelia wondered how then to account for the puncture wound on the head of the\ndog that straggled home. “So what happened?” she\nasked.[17](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn17) After a short pause Amériga suggested that on\nbeing attacked perhaps the coati bit the dog. Thanks to the kind of call the\nsquirrel cuckoo made, and the system through which the women interpreted it,\nAmériga, Luisa, and Delia began to hope that the dogs had not encountered a\nfeline but had instead simply scrapped with a coati and were still alive.\n\nOne might rightly say that this particular system of omens that I have been\ndescribing is specific to humans, or that it is specific even to a particular\nculture. And yet distinguishing between animal tokens and their human types as\nthe women were doing is something more than a human (or cultural) imposition\nonto “nature.” This is because the distinctions they make draw on the formal\nhierarchical properties that distinguish symbols from indices. These formal\nsemiotic properties, which are neither innate nor conventional nor necessarily\nhuman, confer on human symbolic reference some of its unique representational\ncharacteristics when compared to the semiosis that is more generally\ndistributed throughout the biological world. While indices point to instances,\nsymbols have a more general application since their indexical power is\ndistributed throughout the symbolic system in which they are immersed. Yet\nsymbols represent in a manner that draws on indices in special ways (see\nPeirce CP 2.249). This is visible in the distinction people in Ávila make\nbetween shicuá’ and Shicúhua. Shicuá’, a token animal vocalization, which can\notherwise be simply interpreted indexically (signifying the presence of a\nbird, of danger, etc.), can be understood to carry an additional message when\nit is interpreted as an instantiation of the more general human word Shicúhua\nthat stands to it as a type. That type gains traction in the world by virtue\nof its token manifestations.\n\nIn short, the difference between how Luisa and Amériga treated the squirrel\ncuckoo’s call reveals a hierarchical (i.e., unidirectional, nested)\ndistinction between the not-necessarily-human semiosis of life and a human\nform of semiosis that takes up this nonhuman semiosis in special ways. This\ndistinction between these two kinds of semiosis is neither biological nor\ncultural nor human; it is formal.\n\nTHE PLAY OF FORM\n\nIn locating manifestations of type/token distinctions in Runa attempts to make\nsense of the forest’s semiosis, I’ve been discussing hierarchy-as-form. But I\nwant to pause for a moment to reflect on the possibilities inherent to another\nkind of form propagation, also manifest in these trans-species pidgins, which\nis less hierarchical and more lateral or “rhizomatic.” Later that afternoon,\nlong after Amériga’s interpretation of the squirrel cuckoo’s call changed the\nconversation’s direction—long after we discovered that, this shift in\ndirection notwithstanding, the dogs had indeed been killed by a jaguar—Amériga\nand Luisa recalled how as they collected fish poison out in the brush they\neach heard the spot winged antbird call. The spot winged antbird calls\n“chíriqui’,” as people in Ávila imitate it, when jaguars startle them. This\ncall is therefore a well-known indicator of the presence of jaguars, and it is\nalso the onomatopoeic source for chiriquíhua, which is the name for this bird\nin Ávila.\n\nBack at the house, Amériga and Luisa simultaneously reflected on how from\ntheir respective positions in the brush they heard this antbird call at the\nmoment of the attack:\n\nAmériga: | Luisa:  \n---|---  \n| paririhua paririhua  \nshina manchararinga | from heliconia to heliconia  \nthat’s how it gets scared |   \nrunata ricusa | shuma’ shuma’  \neven seeing a person | from one to another  \nmanchana |   \nit gets scared | chíriqui’ chíriqui’  \n“Chiriquíhua Chiriquíhua,” nin | chi uyararca  \nsaying, “Chiriquíhua Chiriquíhua”  | that’s what could be heard  \n“-quíhua” |   \nimachari |   \nwhat might it mean? |   \n  \nIn their parallel recollections of this event Amériga pronounced the bird’s\nname and sought its meaning. The bird was “saying, ‘Chiriquíhua’” (and not\nsimply calling chíriqui’). And because its utterance now conformed to the\nsystemic norms of a general and pan-cosmic runa shimi, what it said now surely\nhad some sort of ominous meaning, even though what exactly this implied\nAmériga wasn’t at the time quite sure.\n\nLuisa, by contrast, simply imitated what “could be heard” and allowed this to\nresonate with other sonic images:\n\n> paririhua paririhua\n>\n> shuma’ shuma’\n>\n> chíriqui’ chíriqui’\n\nHers was an image of the antbird startled by a jaguar, flitting nervously\nthroughout the underbrush from one heliconia leaf to another. Translating\nliberally, one gets an image of this bird going from\n\n> leaf to leaf\n>\n> jumping jumping\n>\n> chíriqui’ chíriqui’\n\nFreed from the interpretive drive to stabilize the call’s meaning, Luisa was\nable to trace the bird’s ecological embedding through a kind of play that is\nopen to the possibilities inherent to the iconic propagation of sonic form.\nIgnoring for a moment the ways in which “chíriqui’” might refer “up” to\nChiriquíhua—a word that “means” something in a broader, relatively more fixed\nsymbolic system—allowing it simply to resonate with other images and tracing\nout these relations, has, then, its own “significant” possibilities.\n\nI want to emphasize the point that eschewing a certain kind of stabilized\nmeaning does not make Luisa’s exploration nonsemiotic. “Chíriqui’” is\nmeaningful without necessarily meaning something. It has a different truck\nwith significance—one that, relatively speaking, is more iconic in logic.\nAmériga, by contrast, was attempting to extract information from the antbird’s\ncall. Surely semiosis serves to convey what Bateson termed “the difference\nwhich makes a difference” (see chapter 2), but, as Luisa’s reaction to the\nantbird indicates, focusing only on how representational systems convey\ndifference misses something fundamental about the ways in which semiosis also\ndepends on the effortless propagation of form. Iconicity is central to this.\n\nIn this regard, I want to return to my discussion in chapter 1 of those\ncryptically camouflaged Amazonian insects known in English as walking sticks\nand referred to by entomologists as phasmids. I want to think about these\ninsects here in terms of form. Their iconicity, as I mentioned, is not based\non someone out there noticing that they look like twigs. Rather, the walking\nstick’s likeness is the product of the fact that the ancestors of its\npotential predators did not notice the differences between their ancestors and\nactual twigs. Over evolutionary time those walking stick lineages that were\nleast noticed survived. In this way a certain form—the “fit” between twig and\ninsect—came to propagate effortlessly into the future.\n\nForm, then, is not imposed from above; it falls out. This, of course, is an\noutcome of a kind of interpretive effort that is more intuitively familiar to\nus; it results from the ways in which predators “work” to notice the\ndifferences between certain insects and their environments. These are the\ninsects that, not being twiglike enough, are eaten. The relation that\niconicity has to confusion or indifference (see chapter 2), as the\nproliferation of “twigginess” reveals, gets at some of the strange logic of\nform and its effortless propagation.\n\nAs Luisa’s verbal play illustrates, iconicity has a certain freedom from our\nlimiting intentions. It can leap out of the symbolic—but not out of semiosis\nor significance. Given the right conditions it can effortlessly explore the\nworld in ways that can create unexpected associations.\n\nThis kind of exploratory freedom is I think what Claude Lévi-Strauss (1966:\n219) was getting at when he wrote of savage thought (not to be confused with\nthe thought of “savages”) as “mind in its untamed state as distinct from mind\ncultivated or domesticated for the purpose of yielding a return.” It is also\nsomething, I believe, that Sigmund Freud grasped in his recognition of how the\nunconscious partakes of the kind of self-organizing logic to which Lévi-\nStrauss is alluding. Such a logic is well exemplified in Freud’s (1999)\nwriting on dreams. It is also visible in his treatment of slips of the tongue,\nmalapropisms, and forgotten names. These emerge in the course of everyday\nconversation when for some reason the intended word is repressed (Freud 1965)\nand they sometimes, as Freud noted with wonder, circulate contagiously from\none person to another (85). English translations of his work call these\n“mistaken” utterances parapraxes, from parapraxia, the defective performance\nof certain purposive acts. That is, when thought’s “purpose of yielding a\nreturn” is removed what is left is that which is ancillary to or beyond what\nis practical: the fragile but effortless iconic propagation of self-organizing\nthought, which resonates with and thereby explores its environment. In the\ncase of parapraxis this can take the form of the spontaneous production of\nalliterative chains that link a forgotten word to a repressed thought (Freud\n1965: 85). Freud’s insight, gesturing quite literally to an “ecology of mind,”\nwas to develop ways to become aware of these iconic associative chains of\nthought (and even to find ways to encourage them to proliferate) and then, by\nobserving them, to learn something about the inner forests these thoughts\nexplore as they resonate through the psyche.\n\nFreud, of course, wanted to tame this kind of thinking. For him, such thoughts\nwere means toward an end. The end was to elicit the repressed latent thoughts\nto which they were ultimately connected and, in this way, to cure his\npatients. The associations themselves, as Kaja Silverman (2009: 44) notes,\nwere for him ultimately irrelevant. But, following Silverman (2009: 65), there\nis another way to think about such chains of\nassociations.[18](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn18) Rather than arbitrary, and pointing\nonly inward toward the psyche, we might see these associations as thoughts in\nthe world—exemplars of a kind of worldly thinking, undomesticated, for the\nmoment, by a particular human mind and her particular ends.\n\nThis is what Luisa’s thinking offers. It is a kind of creativity that comes in\nthe form of listening (Silverman 2009: 62), and its logic is central to how an\nanthropology beyond the human can better attend to the world around us. If\nAmériga was forcing thought to yield its return, Luisa allowed the thoughts of\nthe forest to resonate somewhat more freely as they moved through her. By\nkeeping her imitation of the antbird’s call below the symbolic level, holding\nits potential stabilized “meaning” in abeyance, Luisa allowed the sonic form\nof this vocalization to propagate. Via a chain of partial sonic isomorphisms,\n“chíriqui’” drew in its wake a series of ecological relations with the effect\nthat the traces of the feline were carried across space and species lines\nthrough the dense thickets to that place where Luisa was harvesting fish\npoison the moment her dogs were attacked.\n\nUPFRAMING\n\nThe possibilities inherent to this kind of play notwithstanding, access up to\na type-level perspective—being able to recognize the cuckoo’s call shicuá’ or\nthe anteater’s hiss as instances of the omen Shicúhua—is empowering. And this\nformal hierarchical logic is what informed the Jaminaua shaman’s quest for\napprenticeship downriver. By going downriver, he was able to see the\nparticular river from which he hailed as just one instance of a broader, more\ngeneral pattern. Through this process of “upframing,” he was now privy to the\nview from a higher-order emergent level (a sort of “type”) that encompassed\nthe individual rivers and their villages, which can here be understood as the\nlower-order component parts (the “tokens”) of this system. These properties of\na logical hierarchy, instantiated in an ecosystem, are what allowed this\nshaman to reposition himself within a sociopolitical hierarchy.\n\nNot surprisingly, then, relations between humans and spirits, like those\nbetween humans and animals, are structured by the hierarchical properties\ninherent to semiosis. Here too there is a nested, increased ability to\ninterpret as one moves up the hierarchy. Recall, from the previous chapter,\nthat although the Runa can readily understand the meanings of dog\nvocalizations, dogs can understand human speech only if they are given\nhallucinogens. Similarly, although we humans need hallucinogens to understand\nthe forest masters, these spirits can readily understand human speech; the\nRuna need only talk to them, as, in fact, they sometimes do in the forest.\nJust as animal utterances can be seen as tokens that require a further\ninterpretive step to be seen as conforming to a type, the limited perceptions\nthat humans have of the spirit realm also need to be appropriately translated\ninto a more general idiom to be understood in their true light. The Runa in\ntheir everyday life see the game animals that they hunt in the forest as wild\nanimals. But they know that this is not their true manifestation. Seen from\nthe higher perspective of the spirit masters who own and protect these\ncreatures, these animals are really domesticates. What the Runa see as a gray-\nwinged trumpeter, chachalaca, guan, or tinamou is really the spirit master’s\nchicken. Here too there is a hierarchy that assumes certain logical semiotic\nproperties. All these wild birds, as the Runa experience them in the forest,\nare token instantiations of a more general type—the Chicken—as interpreted at\na higher level. And this something more—this higher emergent level—is also\nsomething less. All those forest birds share something in general in common\nwith a chicken, but treating them solely as the chickens that in some real\nsense they also are erases their particular species-specific singularities.\n\nOne could also say that the spirit master’s perception of the bird requires\nless interpretive effort. Following Peirce’s (CP 2.278) insistence that the\nchain of semiotic interpretance always ends in iconism because it is only with\niconism, as Deacon (1997: 76, 77) underscores, that the differences that would\nrequire further interpretation are no longer noticed (it is with iconism, that\nis, where mental effort ends), we could say that there is less interpretive\neffort required by the masters who see the forest birds just as they really\nare—as domestic chickens. We humans, by contrast, would have to smoke lots of\n“strong” tobacco, take hallucinogens, or dream particularly “well,” as people\nin Ávila would say, to have the privilege of seeing the different kinds of\nwild game birds encountered in the forest as the chickens they really are.\n\nINSIDE\n\nSpirit masters need not exert the interpretive effort we humans require\nbecause, like rubber floating down the river, or the congeries of animals\nattracted to a fruiting tree, or a port city teeming with the upriver riches\nthat collect there, they are already inside this emergent form. In fact,\npeople in Ávila often refer to the reality of the spirit master realm as ucuta\n(inside), as opposed to the everyday human realm, which is jahuaman (on the\nsurface). Because the spirit master realm is, by definition, always inside\nform, the animals are always abundant there, even though we humans aren’t\nalways able to see them. The woolly monkey troop we encountered while hunting\none day that I, with my binoculars, diligently estimated as consisting at most\nof thirty individuals, Asencio, a veteran hunter and careful observer of the\nbeings of the forest, described as numbering in the hundreds. And those\nanimals that are not ever seen in the forests around Ávila, like squirrel\nmonkeys, which are abundant at lower, warmer elevations, or white-lipped\npeccaries, which are no longer found locally, are nevertheless said to be\npresent “inside” the domain of the masters of the forest. It’s not that the\nanimals aren’t there; it’s just that the masters don’t allow us to see them.\nThey don’t allow us inside the form that holds them.\n\nAnimal abundance is not the only thing that is unchanging in the spirit world.\nThe realm of the masters is also a kind of afterlife, Marcelino’s paradise.\nAnd the Runa who go there never age and never die. Not long after the young\nwoman out fishing found her in the forest, Rosa returned to the realm of the\nmasters—this time forever. Ventura later told me that when his mother died\nthey “just buried her skin” (see chapter 3). That is, they buried her\nweatherworn, time-ravaged, maggot-eaten habitus—a sort of clothing that, in\nthe manner of jaguar canines and white clothing, conferred on her, her\nparticular earthly elderly affects. In the realm of the masters, Ventura\nexplained, Rosa will always be a nubile girl, like her granddaughters, her\nbody now immune to the effects of history (figure 8).\n\nThat Rosa will never age in the realm of the masters is also the result of the\npeculiar properties of form. History as we commonly imagine it—as the effects\nof past events on the present—ceases to be the most relevant causal modality\ninside form.[19](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn19) Just as the causes responsible for\nriverine and floristic spatial patterns are in a sense irrelevant to the ways\nin which these can be linked by a highly patterned emergent socioeconomic\nsystem, and just as the words in a language can relate to each other in a way\nthat is largely decoupled from the individual histories of their origins, so\ntoo in the realm of the masters the linearity of history is disrupted by form.\nPre-Hispanic chiefdom hierarchies, cities, bustling market towns, and early-\ntwentieth-century estates, of course, have their own unique temporal contexts.\nBut they now are all caught up in the same form, and, as such, the particular\nhistories of how and when they came to be become, in a certain sense,\nirrelevant. Form then, for a moment, and in a sense, “freezes”\ntime.[20](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn20) All these differently situated historically\ncontingent configurations now participate “ahistorically” in a self-\nreinforcing pattern that people in Ávila attempt to harness to get game meat.\n\nAs a regularity that can potentially exceed ontological domains and temporal\ninstances this kind of form, then, creates an emergent “always already” realm.\nWhat I mean by this is that one outcome of certain kinds of systems that\ncapture and maintain regularity—whether a socioeconomic one that harnesses\nphysical and biological regularities, an expanding language that incorporates\nterms from other vernaculars, or even the historically layered realm of the\nspirit masters of the forest—is that they create a domain of circular\ncausality in which the things that have already happened have never not\nhappened. Take the English language, for example. We know that any given\nsentence might include words of, say, Greek, or Latin, or French, or German\norigin, but these histories are irrelevant to the “timeless” way such words\ncome to give each other meaning by virtue of the circular closure of the\nlinguistic system of which they now form part. My point is that, like\nlanguage, these other, not necessarily human and not necessarily symbolic\nsystems that I have been discussing also create an emergent realm partially\ndecoupled from the histories—the past’s effects on the present—that gave rise\nto them.\n\n![](images/img_0015.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8. “Granddaughters” preparing peach palm beer (chunda asua). Photo by\nauthor.\n\nThe always already realm of the forest masters captures something of the\nquality of being inside form. According to people in Ávila, “the dead,” when\nthey go ucuta, or inside, the spirit realm of the masters, become “free.”\n“Huañugunaca luhuar,” they say; “The dead are free.” Luhuar, which I’m\nglossing as “freedom,” is derived from the Spanish lugar, whose primary\nmeaning is “place.” But lugar also has a temporal referent. The phrase tener\nlugar, although today infrequently used in Ecuadorian Spanish, means to have\nthe time or opportunity to do something. In Quichua luhuar refers to a domain\nwhere worldly spatiotemporal constraints are relaxed. It is a sort of realm\nwhere cause-and-effect no longer directly applies. To become luhuar, as people\nin Ávila explain, is to become free from earthly “toil” and\n“suffering,”[21](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn21) free from God’s judgment and\npunishment,[22](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn22) and free from the effects of time. Inside\nthis perpetual always already realm of the masters in the forest, the dead\njust carry on—free.\n\nHumans do not just impose form on the tropical forest; the forest proliferates\nit. One can think of coevolution as a reciprocal proliferation of regularities\nor habits among interacting species (see chapter 1).[23](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn23)\nThe tropical forest amplifies form in myriad directions thanks to the ways in\nwhich its many kinds of selves interrelate. Over evolutionary time organisms\ncome to represent with increasing specificity environments made ever more\ncomplex through the ways in which other organisms come to more exhaustively\nrepresent their surroundings. In neotropical forests this proliferation of\nhabits has occurred to a degree unmatched by any other nonhuman system on this\nplanet (see chapter 2). Any attempt at harnessing the living beings of the\nforest is wholly dependent on the ways in which such beings are embedded in\nthese regularities.\n\nAs I said, this ubiquity of form does something to time. It freezes it. There\nis something, then, to Lévi-Strauss’s much-maligned characterization of\nAmazonian societies as “cold”—that is, as resistant to historical change—in\njuxtaposition to those “hot” Western societies that supposedly embrace change\n(Lévi-Strauss 1966: 234).[24](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn24) Except what is “cold” here\nis not exactly a bounded society. For the forms that confer on Amazonian\nsociety this “cold” characteristic cross the many boundaries that exist both\ninternal to and beyond human realms. The early-twentieth-century international\nrubber economy was just as constrained by the forest’s forms as is Ávila\nhunting. Like kinds (see chapter 2), form need not stem from the structures we\nhumans impose on the world. Such patterns can emerge in the world beyond the\nhuman. They are emergent with respect to the lower-order historical processes,\nthose that involve the past’s effects on the present, that give rise to them,\nand that also make them useful.\n\nTHE DETRITUS OF HISTORY\n\nThat the emergent forms of the forest are partially decoupled from the\nhistories that gave rise to them does not banish history from the realm of the\nspirit masters of the forest. Bits of history, the detritus of prior formal\nalignments, get frozen inside the forest form and leave their residues\nthere.[25](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn25) For example, Tetrathylacium macrophyllum\n(Flacourtiaceae) is a tree with a cascading panicle of translucent dark red\nfruits whose Quichua name, hualca muyu, means, appropriately, “necklace\nbeads.” However, rather than resemble the popular opaque glass necklace beads\nof Bohemian origin that have been a mainstay of Amazonian trade for the past\ncentury, these fruits bear a striking resemblance to an earlier dark red\ntranslucent Venetian trade bead that was in wide circulation throughout the\ncolonial and neocolonial world. It passed through Ecuador around the time of\nthe presidency of Ignacio de Veintemilla (1878–82) and is, accordingly, still\nreferred to by some Ecuadorians as veintemilla. That the Ávila plant hualca\nmuyu is linked to this nineteenth-century bead is the product of the peculiar\ntime-freezing properties of form. The historical trace of a good that was\ntraded and, like Simson’s beads, commensurated with forest products remains\ncaught in the always already form of the forest master’s realm, even after\npeople have long forgotten it. Another example: some kinds of demonic spirits,\nsupai, that wander the forest are described as wearing priestly habits, even\nthough today’s local priests have long since abandoned wearing the black robe.\n\nIt is not, then, that history simply permeates the Amazonian landscape, as\ncritical cultural geographers and historical ecologists contend as a counter\nto the romantic myth of a pristine wild Amazonian\n“nature.”[26](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn26) Instead, the history that gets caught in\nthe forest is mediated and mutated by a form that is not exactly reducible to\nhuman events or landscape.\n\nThe challenge for the Runa is how to access the forms of the forest that\nconcentrate wealth. For in this always already realm animals exist in\nunchanging abundance. As with the Juruá-area shaman, the way they do this\ninvolves a process of upframing to see animals from the privileged (and\nobjectifying) perspective of the masters—namely, not as singular selves, each\nwith its own point of view, but as resources, and not as ephemeral subjects\nbut as stabilized objects, owned and controlled by the master, a more\npowerful, emergent self. The Runa attempt to access the riches of the forest\nmasters by mobilizing the disparate historical traces of strategies for\nnegotiating with people more powerful than themselves that have gotten caught\nup—frozen, like Venetian trade beads and priestly habits—inside the master’s\nform.\n\nFor example, it’s been over a century and a half since the Runa had to pay\nregular tribute to government officials and clergy (Oberem 1980: 112), yet\ntribute still exists in the realm of the masters. When people kill a tapir\nthey are required to offer trade beads as tribute to the spirit masters that\nown this animal, so that these masters will continue to provide meat. Out on a\nhunting trip, Juanicu attempted to capitalize on the reciprocal obligations\nthat this colonial arrangement entails. He offered the master tribute in the\nform of a few grains of corn tucked in the crevices of a tree base. When the\nmaster failed to provide us with game meat, as was his obligation, given that\nJuanicu had dutifully kept up his side of the bargain, Juanicu unashamedly\nreprimanded him—yelling, in the middle of the forest, “You’re stingy!”—in\nexactly the same way I once heard him rebuke a politician visiting Ávila\nduring election season who failed to give out cigarettes and drink.\n\nOn other occasions the Runa attempt to communicate with the masters through\nrhetorical formulas identical to those their sixteenth-century forebears used\nin negotiating peace contracts with the Spaniards. These include invoking a\nnumerically parallel structure that attempts to make more balanced what, in\nanother context, Lisa Rofel (1999) has called “uneven\ndialogues”:[27](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn27) in the colonial case this involved making\nfive demands in exchange for five concessions to the Spanish authorities, as\nis visible in one such late-sixteenth-century contract between the local\nindigenous chiefs and Spaniards (Ordóñez de Cevallos 1989 [1614]: 426). In the\ncontemporary one, it is evident in the use of certain hunting and fishing\ncharms that require a special ten-day fast—“five days for the master and five\nfor the Runa,” as people in Ávila put it.[28](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn28)\n\nAnd the Quito-in-the-forest to which Rosa traveled is a reflection of more\nthan four centuries of earnest attempts by Ávila-area people to negotiate with\nthe powerful beings that live there for access to some of their wealth.\nIndeed, part of those sixteenth-century negotiations involved an attempt,\nunsuccessful alas, to convince the Spaniards to build a Quito in the Amazon—a\nrequest to which colonial documents (Ramírez Dávalos 1989 [1559]: 50, see also\n39) and contemporary myths attest, and whose deferral continues to motivate\ndesires to harness the riches that are harbored inside the\nforest.[29](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn29)\n\nEach strategy for accessing the accumulated riches of the powerful has an\nindependent causal history. But this no longer matters. They are all now part\nof something general, the forest master’s form. And they can each serve as\npoints of access to some of its riches.\n\nIt is not, however, just abundant game meat that such strategies promise. For\nthey also hold out the possibility of some sort of access to the long and\nlayered history of deferred desires that the quest for this meat has come to\nrepresent.\n\nFORM’S EFFORTLESS EFFICACY\n\nI hope here to have illustrated some of the peculiar properties of form, and I\nhope to have given some sense of why anthropology should pay form more\nattention. That it hasn’t is, indeed, also an effect of form’s peculiar\nproperties. As anthropologists we are well equipped to analyze that which is\ndifferent. However, as Annelise Riles (2000) has noted in her study of the\ncirculation of bureaucratic forms associated with Fijian participants in a UN\nconference, we are less ready to study that which is invisible because we are\n“inside” it. Form largely lacks the palpable otherness—the secondness (see\nchapter 1)—of a traditional ethnographic object because it is only manifest\nqua form in the propagation of its self-similarity. “It is the people who are\noutside of the monastery who feel its atmosphere,” writes the Zen master.\n“Those who are practicing actually do not feel anything” (Suzuki 2001: 78).\n\nFor these reasons it is much easier to understand the semiotic importance of\nindexicality—the noticing of difference—than it is to understand iconicity,\nwhich involves the propagation of regularities, through a specially\nconstrained sort of indifference (see chapter 2). Perhaps this is why the\npropagation of similarity through indistinction is sometimes erroneously\nconsidered something other than representation. However, walking stick\n“twigginess” and a contagious yawn that propagates across bodies and even\npossibly across species lines (to give just two examples where iconicity is\npredominant) are semiotic phenomena, even though they largely lack an\nindexical component that can be interpreted as pointing to anything other than\nanother instance of the patterns they instantiate. One could say that our\nhabits become noticeable to us only when they are disrupted, when we fall\noutside of them (see chapter 1). And yet understanding the workings of that\nwhich is not noticed is crucial for an anthropology beyond the human. Form is\nprecisely this sort of invisible phenomenon.\n\nForm requires us to rethink what we mean by the “real.” Generals—that is,\nhabits, regularities, potential recurrences, and patterns—are real (see\nchapter 1). But it would be wrong to attribute to generals the kinds of\nqualities that we associate with the reality of existent objects. When I say\nthat game birds are, from the perspective of the masters, really chickens, I\nam referring precisely to this way in which generals are real. The reality of\nthe master’s chicken is that of a general. And yet it has a possible eventual\nefficacy: it is able, as a sort of type, to index specific encounters with\ndifferent kinds of birds, be they guans, chachalacas, or curassows. In this\nrespect these encounters are not unlike the one I had with the peccary on that\nrainy day in the forest.\n\nWithout the day-to-day interactions that the Runa have with game birds, there\nwould be no chickens in the realm of the masters. And yet the master realm\nenjoys a level of stability, which is partially decoupled from these day-to-\nday moments of forest interaction. This is why in the realm of the masters\nwhite-lipped peccaries can abound even though they haven’t been found in the\nforests surrounding Ávila for many years now.\n\nAlthough stable, form is fragile. It can emerge only under specific\ncircumstances. I was reminded of this when I took a break from writing this\nchapter to prepare a pot of cream of wheat for my sons. Before my very eyes,\nthe telltale self-organizing hexagonal structures known as Bénard cells, which\nform as liquid is heated from the bottom and cooled from the top under just\nthe right conditions, spontaneously emerged across the surface of the\nsimmering cereal. That these hexagonal structures promptly collapsed back into\nthe sticky gruel is testament to form’s fragility. Life is particularly adept\nat creating and sustaining those conditions that will encourage such fragile\nself-organizing processes to predictably take place (see Camazine 2001). This,\nin part, is why I have focused here on the ways in which complex multispecies\nassociations cultivate form in ways that also think their ways through us when\nwe become immersed in their “fleshliness.”[30](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn30)\n\nForm cannot be understood without paying attention to the kinds of\ncontinuities and connections that generals have with regard to existents.\nAccordingly, my concern here has been not just with form and those properties\nthat make it unique—its invisibility, its effortless propagation, a kind of\ncausality associated with it that appears to freeze history—but also with the\nways in which form emerges from and relates to other phenomena in a manner\nthat makes its unique properties come to matter in the worlds of living\nbeings. I am not just interested in that which is “inside,” but in how such an\ninside came to be, and also how it dissolves when the material conditions—be\nthey riverbeds, parasites, or UN paychecks—necessary for its propagation cease\nto exist. And I am not just interested in form per se, but in how we “do\nthings with” it. And yet doing things with form requires becoming infected\nwith its causal logic, a logic that is quite different from that which is\nassociated with the pushes and pulls of efficient causality, different, that\nis, from the ways in which the past affects the present. Doing things with\nform requires succumbing to its effortless efficacy.\n\nNone of this is to lose sight of the unique properties of form, and the\npossibility, as Riles notes, that anthropology might emerge from its crisis of\nrepresentation by experimenting with ways of making the invisible “inside”\nmore apparent. Building on Strathern (1995, 2004 [1991]), Riles’s solution is\nto turn form “inside out.” That is, she attempts to render form visible\nthrough an ethnographic methodology that amplifies it. Rather than try to make\nform apparent from an external perspective by indicating our discontinuities\nwith it, she allows the patternings inherent to the proliferation of\nbureaucratic documents and the ones we academics might produce about them to\nmultiply until their similarities become manifest.\n\nI offer here no such aesthetic solution to the problem of elucidating form. I\nonly wish to give a sense of some of the ways in which form moved through me.\nWhen I dreamed that night at Ventura’s house of a peccary in a pen perhaps I\ntoo for a moment got caught up “inside” the forest master’s form. What I would\nlike to suggest is that the semiotics of dreaming, understood in terms of the\npeculiar properties of form I have explored here, involves the spontaneous,\nself-organizing apperception and propagation of iconic associations in ways\nthat can dissolve some of the boundaries we usually recognize between insides\nand outsides.[31](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn31) That is, when the conscious, purposive\ndaytime work of discerning difference is relaxed, when we no longer ask\nthought for a “return,” we are left with self-similar iterations—the\neffortless manner in which likeness propagates through us. This is akin to\nLuisa’s sonic web that linked the antbird to heliconias and to the jaguar that\nkilled the dogs and all these to the humans in the forest whose dog that was—a\nweb that emerged in the space of possibility that opened because she did not\nattempt to specify the meaning of the bird’s call that she imitated. (Luisa\nwas, in a sense, free.)\n\nConsidering it alongside this and the other various form propagations I’ve\ndiscussed here, I’ve come to wonder how much my dream was ever really my own;\nfor a moment, perhaps, my thinking became one with how the forest thinks.\nPerhaps, like Lévi-Strauss’s myths, there is indeed something about such\ndreams, which “think in men, unbeknownst to them.”[32](Notes.xhtml#ch5fn32)\nDreaming may well be, then, a sort of thought run wild—a human form of\nthinking that goes well beyond the human and therefore one that is central to\nan anthropology beyond the human. Dreaming is a sort of “pensée sauvage”: a\nform of thinking unfettered from its own intentions and therefore susceptible\nto the play of forms in which it has become immersed—which, in my case, and\nthat of the Ávila Runa, is one that gets caught up and amplified in the\nmultispecies, memory-laden wilderness of an Amazon forest.\n\n\n![](images/img_0016.jpg)\n\nSIX\n\n* * *\n\nThe Living Future (and the Imponderable Weight of the Dead)\n\nfire escapes old as you\n\n–Tho you’re not old now, that’s left here with me\n\n—Allen Ginsberg, Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg\n\nA tuft of fur snagged on a spine was the final clue that led us to the body of\nthe peccary that Oswaldo shot several hours before. We were on Basaqui Urcu, a\nsteep foothill of Sumaco Volcano northwest of Ávila. Swatting at the swarm of\nblood-sucking flies[1](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn1) inherited from our quarry we sat\ndown to rest. As we caught our breath Oswaldo began to tell me what he had\ndreamed the night before. “I was visiting my compadre in Loreto,” he said,\nreferring to the market town and center of colonist expansion half a day’s\nwalk from Ávila, “when suddenly a menacing policeman appeared. His shirt was\ncovered with clippings from a haircut.” Frightened, Oswaldo awoke and\nwhispered to his wife, “I’ve dreamed badly.”\n\nFortunately he was wrong. As the events of the day would prove Oswaldo had in\nfact dreamed well. The hair on the policeman’s shirt turned out to have\naugured killing the peccary whose body now lay beside us (after hauling a\npeccary carcass, bristles will cling to a hunter’s shirt just like hair\nclippings). Nonetheless, Oswaldo’s interpretive dilemma points to a profound\nambivalence that permeates Runa life: men can see themselves as potent\npredators akin to powerful “whites” such as the policeman, yet also feel like\nthe helpless prey of these same rapacious figures.\n\nWas Oswaldo the policeman, or had he become prey? What happened that day on\nBasaqui Urcu speaks to the complexity of Oswaldo’s position. Who is that\nfrightening figure that is also so familiar? How can a policeman, a being so\nthreatening and foreign, also be oneself? This uncanny juxtaposition reveals\nsomething important about Oswaldo’s ongoing struggle to be and become, in\nrelation to the many kinds of others he encounters in the forests around Ávila\nthat make him who he is.[2](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn2)\n\nThese many kinds of others that “people” the forests around Ávila include the\nliving ones that the Runa hunt and who on occasion hunt them. But their ranks\nare also filled by specters of a long pre-Hispanic, colonial, and republican\nhistory. These specters include the dead, certain demonic spirits (who might\nalso prey on the Runa), and the masters of the animals—all of these continue\nin a different but nonetheless real way to walk those forests that Oswaldo\ntraverses.\n\nWho Oswaldo is cannot be disentangled from how he relates to these many kinds\nof beings. The shifting ecology of selves (see chapter 2) that he must\nconstantly negotiate in his hunts in the forest, as well as on his visits to\nLoreto, is also inside him: it makes up his “ecology” of self.\n\nMore to the point, Oswaldo’s dilemma speaks to the question of how to survive\nas a self and what such continuity might mean. How should Oswaldo avoid\nbecoming prey, an it, dead meat, when the position of hunter—the I in this\nvenatic relation—has now come to be occupied by outsiders more powerful than\nhimself?\n\nThe Runa have long lived in a world where whites—Europeans and later\nEcuadorian as well as Colombian and Peruvian nationals—have stood in a\nposition of manifest dominance over them and where whites qua whites have been\nintent on imposing a worldview that justifies this position. Here is how a\nrubber-boom–era estate boss, living on the confluence of the Villano and\nCuraray Rivers, writes about another boss’s attempts to make his Runa peons\nsee things this way:\n\n> In order to convince them of the superiority of the white man over the\n> Indians by reason of our customs and knowledge, and to rid them of their\n> hatred of the Spanish language, a neighbor of mine on this river, a rubber\n> man, employer of many laborers, called together all the Indians one day and\n> showed them a figure of Christ. “This is God,” he said to them. Then he\n> added: “Is it not true that he is a viracocha [white man] with a beautiful\n> beard?” All the Indians admitted that he was a viracocha, adding that he was\n> the amo [master] of everything. (Quoted in Porras 1979: 43)\n\nThe estate owner’s take on Runa-white relations encapsulates a certain history\nof conquest and domination in the Upper Amazon that simply cannot be ignored.\nIt is a historical fact that whites have come to be los amos—the masters—of\n“everything.” In facing this colonial situation of domination as history, we\nmight expect two responses. The Runa could simply acquiesce, accepting a\nsubservient position. Or they could resist. However, as Oswaldo’s dream\nalready indicates, there is another way to live with this situation. And this\nother way challenges us to question our understanding of how the past shapes\nthe present at the same time that it suggests a way of inhabiting a future.\n\nRuna politics are not straightforward. Although domination is a historical\nfact, it is a fact caught up in a form (see chapter 5). As I explore in this\nchapter, it is caught up in a form that takes shape in the realm of the spirit\nmasters of the forest—a realm whose particular configuration is sustained by\nthe ways in which people like Oswaldo continue to engage the forest’s ecology\nof selves in their own search for sustenance.\n\nThis realm of the spirit masters of the forest also sustains Oswaldo in a\npsychic sense. And there is no vantage from which he can escape or resist this\ncondition. He is always already in some way or another “inside” its form. The\npolitical theorist Judith Butler alludes to such a dynamic in her observation\nthat\n\n> [t]o be dominated by a power external to oneself is a familiar and agonizing\n> form power takes. To find, however, that what “one” is, one’s very formation\n> as a subject, is in some sense dependent on that power is quite another. We\n> are used to thinking of power as what presses on the subject from the\n> outside. . . . But if . . . we understand power as forming the subject as\n> well as providing the very condition of its existence . . . then power is\n> not simply what we oppose, but also, in a strong sense, what we depend on\n> for our existence and what we harbor and preserve in the beings that we are.\n> (Butler 1997: 1–2)\n\nButler contrasts the brutal aspect of power in its cold externality to the\nsubtle but no less real ways in which power pervades, creates, and sustains\nour very being. For power, as Butler intimates, is not reducible to the sum\ntotal of brutal acts. Power takes on a general form even if it is also\ninstantiated—palpably, painfully—in the world and on our\nbodies.[3](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn3)\n\nThis final chapter of How Forests Think seeks to ask, with attention to\nOswaldo’s predicament, what, following Butler, it might mean to be and become\nin “formation.” But it reconfigures this question by reflecting on how our\nunderstanding of the ways in which power works itself through form changes\nwhen we recognize form as a kind of reality beyond the human.\n\nIn this regard, I build on my discussion of form from the previous chapter.\nForm is, as I argued there, neither necessarily human nor necessarily alive,\neven though it is captured and cultivated by life and even though form also\nproliferates in those dense ecologies of selves such as the ones that exist in\nthe forests around Ávila. In chapter 5 I discussed how harnessing form\ninvolves being made over by form’s strange mode of effortless efficacy—a kind\nof efficacy in which the past’s effect on the present ceases to be the only\ncausal modality at play. If we are made over in our harnessing of form’s\nstrange causal logic—the self that harnesses form does not just do so by\npushing, pulling, or resisting—then what we mean by agency changes. And if\nagency becomes something different, then politics changes as well.\n\nBut to understand Oswaldo’s predicament we need to think not just in terms of\nthe logics of form that the forest amplifies but also in terms of form’s\nrelation to certain other logics intrinsic to life. For what ultimately is at\nstake for Oswaldo, as his dream makes manifest, is survival. And the problem\nof survival is one that concerns the living (for it is after all only the\nliving who die). If form, as I discussed in the previous chapter, can\nsometimes have the effect of freezing time, in ways that change our\nunderstandings of causality and agency, life disrupts our commonplace\nunderstanding of the passage of time in a different way, and this too must be\nconsidered in trying to understand Oswaldo’s predicament. For, in the realm of\nlife, it is not just the past that affects the present, nor is time just\nfrozen. Rather, life involves, in addition to these, the special ways in which\nthe future comes to affect the present as well.\n\nLet me illustrate this way in which the future affects the present in the\nrealm of life with a simple example from the forest. In order for a jaguar to\nsuccessfully pounce on an agouti she must be able to “re-present” where that\nagouti will be. This re-presentation amounts to an importation of the future—a\n“guess” at what the agouti’s future position will be—into the present via the\nmediation of signs. Being semiotic creatures through and through (see chapter\n2), “we” all always have one foot (or paw) in the future.\n\nIn this chapter I’m thinking about this intrinsic relationship that obtains\nbetween life and future by reference to what Peirce called a “living future”\n(CP 8.194). This living future, as I argue here, cannot be understood without\nfurther reflecting on the special links that life has to all the dead that\nmake life possible. It is in this sense that the living forest is also one\nthat is haunted. And this haunting gets, in part, at what I mean when I say\nthat spirits are real.\n\nSurvival—how to go about inhabiting a future—this is Oswaldo’s challenge. And\nthe solutions he finds are inflected by the living-future logic that is\namplified in the forests he traverses. But survival here for Oswaldo is also\nan all-too-human problem (see chapter 4), one in which questions of power\ncannot be avoided. And this makes the problem of survival also a political\none; for it prompts us to think about how we can find other ways to harness\nthe power that will ultimately sustain our being in a manner that enables “us”\nto grow and even to flourish.\n\nThis chapter, then, focuses on the realm of the spirit masters of the forest.\nIt does so with particular attention to how that realm makes apparent some\naspect of the ways in which life (human and nonhuman) is connected to death,\ncontinuity to finitude, future to past, absence to presence, supernatural to\nnatural, and ethereal generality to palpable singularity. All of these,\nultimately, say something about the formative connection a self has to its\nmany others. My interest here is to see how these articulations, as they\nbecome expressed in the realm of the masters, amplify and render conceptually\navailable to us some of the living-future logic of a thinking forest—a logic\nthat can help us take anthropology beyond the human.\n\nThat Oswaldo at a certain moment in the forest can—perhaps must—be a white\npoliceman, involves the particular and sometimes disjointed and even painful\nways in which some aspect of his future self reaches back to affect him from\nthis realm of the forest masters. In the process it exposes the logic of some\nof these articulations that I mentioned. This spirit realm that emerges from\nthe life of the forest, as a product of a whole host of relations that cross\nspecies lines and temporal epochs, is, then, a zone of continuity and\npossibility: Oswaldo’s survival depends on his ability to access it. And yet\nOswaldo’s survival also depends on the many kinds of dead and the many kinds\nof deaths that this spirit realm holds in its configuration and that make a\nliving future possible. Who one might be is intimately related to all those\nwho one is not; we are forever giving ourselves over and indebted to these\nmany others who make us who “we” are (see Mauss 1990\n[1950]).[4](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn4)\n\nAlthough it emerges out of Runa histories of engaging with the many kinds of\nselves that people their world, the realm of the spirit masters is also\nsomething other than the product of these histories of engagement. This realm\nis a sort of afterlife, which is closely related to but not reducible to the\nlife that has come before it. It is, in this sense, its own kind of emergent\nreal—one that is neither natural nor exactly cultural.\n\nI explore this emergent ethereal realm with specific attention to the\nethnographic manifestation of some of its special properties as well as to the\nhopeful politics that it might harbor. My goal is to reflect more generally\nabout what this realm beyond the living—one that emerges from the rich\necologies of selves that the forest houses—can tell us about the living logics\nthat such a thinking forest reveals.\n\nVenturing beyond the living, as I do here, is important for the anthropology\nbeyond the human that I have been trying to develop, for it is with attention\nto this realm of the spirit masters of the forest that we can better\nunderstand what continuity might mean and how best to face that which\nthreatens it. In short, attending to what those spirits of the forest can\nteach us about continuity, growth, and even “flourishing” can allow us to\ncultivate other ways of thinking about how “we” might find better ways to live\nin the living future.\n\nALWAYS ALREADY RUNA\n\nA curious mural that adorned the walls of the multipurpose hall of the\nheadquarters of FOIN, the federation that represents the Runa communities of\nNapo Province (figure 9), seems to describe a progression from Amazonian\nsavagery to European civilization. At the far left of a lineup of five men\nstands a long-haired “savage” Indian holding a blowgun and what appears to be\na shell horn of the sort used to call and mobilize kith and\nkin.[5](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn5) He is what we would consider “naked,” though he\nwears a penis string, face paint, necklace, and arm, wrist, and head bands.\nThe next man wears a loincloth, and the horn lies behind him on the ground;\notherwise he looks nearly identical. Then stands a man who, in keeping with\nRuna fashion of the late nineteenth century, wears shorts and a small tunic or\nponcho. He has just a dab of face paint and tries to hide his blowgun behind\nhis back. The next man in the progression is fully clothed. He wears shoes,\nlong pants, and a crisp white short-sleeved shirt. He is handsome, and whereas\nthe previous figures have tiny heads, no necks, and huge arms, this man’s body\nis well proportioned. The blowgun that caused the previous man such shame now\nsimply lies abandoned behind him. He is also the only one who offers any hint\nof a smile. This figure is the epitome of a contemporary Runa man in the\nimaginary of the labor-union–influenced FOIN leadership of the 1970s and\n1980s, a leadership that came of age before the influx of the international\nNGOs, and one that had yet to become culturally or environmentally\n“conscious.” He is a Runa campesino, neither ethnic nor elite, neither sylvan\nnor urban. The final figure emerging from this backdrop now littered with the\ndiscarded trappings of a timeless savagery wears glasses, a suit, and a tie.\nHis hair is neatly parted down the middle, and he sports a pencil moustache—a\ncarefully nurtured wisp of the facial hair that whites seem to have no problem\nproducing in revolting but also awesome abundance. He has the slight build of\nsomeone who has spent too much time indoors. He stands at grim attention. He\nseems nervous. In his right hand he clutches a briefcase. Strapped on his left\narm, a wristwatch inexorably marks off the minutes of a day that is inside a\nlinear temporality of which this man is now very much a part.\n\n![](images/img_0017.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9. “To make brutes into men, and men into Christians” (Figueroa 1986\n[1661]: 249): This mural, which existed in the headquarters of the indigenous\nfederation FOIN during the late 1980s, ambiguously illustrates the legacies of\nthis colonial endeavor. Photo by author.\n\nIn the late 1980s I did some volunteer work for the federation that for a time\nhad me living in its headquarters. This mural covered one of the walls. One\nevening, to celebrate the end of a workshop, the participants, primarily Runa\nmen and women from Tena and Archidona and the villages that surround these\ntowns, which are much more urban and less oriented toward the forest than\nÁvila, held a party at the headquarters. The mural was the source of a running\njoke throughout the evening. Every so often someone, invariably male, would\npoint to one of the “savage” Indians standing to the left of the handsome Runa\nman in the lineup to indicate the stage of drunkenness to which he had\ndescended.\n\nThe mural speaks to the primitivist narrative that has guided both\nmissionaries and colonists in this region: before the arrival of Europeans\nnaked “wild savages” were the Amazon’s only inhabitants; through a process of\n“taming” that spanned the colonial and early republican periods and continues\nto this day some of these wild savages became civilized, clothed, monogamous,\nsalt-eating, and unthreatening Runa; they became, according to the colonial\nterminology, indios mansos, or tame Indians (Taylor 1999). Survivals of what,\naccording to this logic, would be the primordial wild substrate can still be\nfound in certain isolated regions. Some members of the Huaorani ethnic group\n(sometimes still pejoratively referred to in Quichua as Auca), who are\nconsidered homicidal, polygamous, and naked, serve as the present-day models\nfor the depiction of savagery to the far left of the\nmural.[6](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn6) The seventeenth-century Jesuit priest Francisco\nde Figueroa succinctly described this colonial project of attempting to\nfashion a certain kind of person. The missionary goal, he wrote, is “to make”\nAmazonian “brutes into men, and men into Christians” (Figueroa 1986 [1661]:\n249).[7](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn7) The revelers that night were playing with the\ninherited legacies of this attempt (see also Rogers 1995).\n\nMany people in Ávila would not disagree with such distinctions between savage\nand civilized. They emphatically concur that being human in the right ways\ninvolves eating salt, wearing clothing, and refraining from homicide and\npolygamy (see also Muratorio 1987: 55). But they differ as to how—or even\nwhether—to locate these traits in time. The missionaries saw the adoption of\nthese traits as the result of a gradual process of “taming” a brutish\nAmazonian substrate. In Ávila, however, “civilized” attributes such as\nmonogamy and eating salt are primordial aspects of Runa humanity. The Runa\nhave always already been civilized.\n\nAn Ávila diluvial myth illustrates this. When the great flood swept over the\nland many Runa managed to save themselves by climbing to the top of Yahuar\nUrcu, one of the highest peaks in the area. Other Runa attempted to escape by\nboarding canoes. The women on board twined their long hair in an attempt to\nmoor themselves to the treetops still above water. When these lashings became\nundone the canoes floated downriver and came to rest in what is today Huaorani\nterritory. There the clothing of those Runa eventually wore away, and they\nalso ran out of salt. They began killing people and thus became the present-\nday Aucas. The Aucas, then, are not the primordial savages from which the\nChristianized Runa evolved. Rather, they are fallen Runa. They too were once\nsalt-eating, clothed, and peaceful Christians. Although the Quichua term Auca\nis generally translated as “savage” or “infidel,” it may be more accurate to\nthink of Aucas as apostates. They are those who have abandoned their former\nRuna way of life.[8](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn8) The Runa have always already been\nRuna. “Savages,” by contrast, became so as their canoes swept them down the\nflooded rivers, carrying them far away from their unchanging Runa homeland;\nthey are the ones who fell out of form and into time.\n\nThe “Runa” man of the primitivist mural—made by his past, vanishing in the\nfuture—is not, then, exactly congruent with this other kind of being, this\n“always already” Runa of Ávila. What I am suggesting is that for the Ávila\nRuna the mural would not depict a progression leading elsewhere but an ongoing\nfugue around a central figure—a Runa self—who always already is what he will\nbecome even in his ongoing and open-ended becoming. This constantly changing\nself, who is also continuous with his past and potential future\ninstantiations, points to something important about life, and flourishing, in\nan ecology of selves.\n\nNAMES\n\nWe tend to think of a term like the Runa as an ethnonym, a proper noun used to\nname another. And this is how I’ve been using it throughout this book. For\nsuch a term to be deemed appropriate, standard anthropological practice\ndictates that it be the name the people in question use for themselves. This\nis why we do not refer to the Huaorani by their pejorative Quichua name\n“Auca.” And “Runa,” at least when modified by a place name, is certainly used\nas an ethnonym in Ávila to refer to Quichua-speaking inhabitants of Amazonian\nEcuador. So, for example, “the San José Runa” refers to the people from San\nJosé de Payamino. And those from San José de Payamino call their Ávila\nneighbors “the Ávila Runa.” Naming others is unavoidable.\n\nAnd yet people in Ávila do not name themselves. They don’t call themselves the\nRuna (or the Ávila Runa for that matter). Nor do they use the term Kichwa, the\nethnonym currently employed in the contemporary regional and especially\nnational indigenous political movement. If we treat “Runa” as a label—asking\nonly whether it is the right label—something important is obscured; the Runa\ndon’t use labels for themselves. In a certain straightforward sense, Runa, in\nQuichua, simply means “person.” But it does not merely function as a\nsubstantive to be co-opted as an ethnonym, a label.\n\nGoing back to the mural, the man beaming and wearing a crisp white shirt,\nstanding between the “savages” and the “white man,” is, by any account,\n“Runa.” From the primitivist point of view “Runa” here would be an ethnonym, a\nlabel for a waypoint in a historical process of transformation in which one\nkind of being is made into another, on the way to becoming still another. The\nÁvila take on this, however, would be different. The man in the crisp white\nshirt would still be “Runa,” but the label would refer to something else,\nsomething less visible, less easily nameable than a cultural group from which\none came. This man never became Runa; he has always already been Runa.\n\nWhat I wish to suggest, and this is something I hope will become more evident\nas the chapter progresses, is that “Runa” more accurately marks a relational\nsubject position in a cosmic ecology of selves in which all beings see\nthemselves as persons. “Runa” here is the self, in continuity of form. All\nbeings are, from their points of view, in a sense “Runa,” because this is how\nthey would experience themselves when “saying” I.\n\nIf we treat “Runa” as a substantive we miss the way it actually functions more\nlike a personal pronoun. We usually think of pronouns as words that stand in\nthe place of nouns. But Peirce suggests that we flip this relation. Pronouns\nare not substitutes for nouns; rather, “they indicate things in the directest\npossible way,” by pointing to them. Nouns are indirectly related to their\nreferents, and thus they ultimately rely on these sorts of pointing relations\nfor their meaning. This leads Peirce to conclude that “a noun is an imperfect\nsubstitute for a pronoun,” and not the other way around (1998b: 15). I want to\nsuggest here that the Runa man who is the subject of the mural is—on the Ávila\ntake—functioning as a special kind of first-person pronoun: an I, or perhaps\nmore accurately an us, in all its coming possibility.\n\nAs a noun “Runa” is an “imperfect substitute for a pronoun.” In its\nimperfection it carries the traces of all the others with whom it has become\nan us in relation. What it is, and what it might become, is shaped by virtue\nof all the predicates—eating salt, monogamy, and so on—it has acquired, even\nthough it is also something other than the sum total of these.\n\nAn I is always in some sense invisible. By contrast, it is the other—the he,\nthe she, the it objectified—that can be seen and named. I should note that the\nthird person—the other—corresponds to Peirce’s secondness. It is what is\npalpable, visible, and actual because it stands outside us (see chapter 1).\nThis in part explains why self-naming is so rare in Amazonian ecologies of\nselves. As Viveiros de Castro has observed, naming is really reserved for\nothers: “ethnonyms are names for third parties; they belong to the category of\n‘they’ not the category of ‘we’” (1998: 476). It is not a question, then, of\nwhich ethnonym to use but a question of whether any ethnonym can capture a\nself’s point of view. Naming objectifies, and that is what one does to\nothers—to its.[9](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn9) The Runa—I’m slipping back into using\nthe objectifying label—are not the its of history. They are Is, part of an\nongoing us, alive, in life, surviving—flourishing.\n\nRuna-as-I, as-us, is not a thing, to be affected by the past in the cause-and-\neffect ways in which things are. The Runa are not the objects of history. They\nare not its products. They were not made by history in this cause-and-effect\nsense. And yet who they are is an outcome of a certain intimate relation to\nthe past.\n\nThis relation involves another kind of absence as well. It involves a relation\nto the absent dead. In this regard, the Runa are like the cryptic Amazonian\ninsect known as the walking stick, which comes to be increasingly invisible in\nits growing confusion with twigs by virtue of all those other beings that it\nis not. Those other, somewhat less “twiggy” walking sticks, are the ones who\nbecome visible and in their visibility become the tangible, actual objects—the\nothers, the its—of predation in such a way that the potential future lineages\nof those who remain invisible can continue on, hidden and yet haunted (by\nvirtue of this constitutive absence) by these others that are not them.\n\nAMO\n\nOswaldo’s continuity as an I, as Runa, requires that he be a puma—a predator.\nHe must be the hunter and not the hunted peccary he feared he would become\nwhen he encountered that policeman covered in hair clippings standing at his\nfriend’s door. Puma, recall, is often hypostasized as jaguar—its primary\nexemplar—although it more accurately marks a relational position of a self, an\nI continuing as I and alive, thanks to an objectifying relationship to other\nselves that this self creates through predation. As such, like “Runa,” it too\nfunctions as an “imperfect substitute for a pronoun.” Oswaldo is—must be—runa\npuma, a human-jaguar, to persist.\n\nIn Ávila, runa puma is synonymous with a kind of maturity of self. Many men,\nand many women too, cultivate a sort of becoming-puma, so that, after death,\nafter their human skins are buried, they enter a jaguar body, to continue on,\nas a self, and an I—an I that is invisible to themselves, yet able to see\nothers as prey, while being seen by these others as predator. One cultivates\nthis puma nature not only with regard to one’s postmortem future but, perhaps\nmore important, so that this future puma will also inform one’s present\nability to continue living as a self; becoming-puma is a form of worldly\nempowerment.\n\nAnd yet predation is a fraught form of relating, not without its own\nanxieties. A few months after killing the pig, Oswaldo dreamed of another such\nencounter. In this encounter he didn’t have his gun. All he had was an empty\nrefillable shotgun cartridge. Somehow he managed to shoot his quarry by\nblowing through the little hole at the cartridge’s base as if it were a\nblowgun.[10](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn10) To his dismay, he suddenly realized that the\n“prey” he had shot in this fashion was not a pig but a friend from Loreto.\nWounded in the neck, this friend ran to the safety of his house, only to\nemerge shortly after, now armed, and in pursuit of Oswaldo. There is something\nunmanageable, chaotic, and amoral about predation. It is a kind of power that\ncan come back to haunt you.\n\nIn the 1920s Runa from the Napo River told the explorer and ethnographer\nMarquis Robert de Wavrin of how, many generations ago, some shamans escaped\nSpanish domination by putting on jaguar skins—“black ones, spotted ones,\nyellow ones”—and in this way becoming puma. Having become predators and living\ndeep in the forest, they managed to evade the Spaniards, but they also began\nto turn on their fellow Runa—first by hunting the unfortunate hunters who\nventured out in the forest and then by attacking their own Runa villages\n(Wavrin 1927: 328–29).\n\nIt is not entirely clear why predation has come to be such an important means\nof relating in Amazonia. Certainly there are many other forms of trans-species\nrelating; it was, for example, through a parasitic—not a\npredatory—relationship that Oswaldo’s and my blood became commingled with each\nother’s and with that of the peccary in the forest that day as the swarm of\nblood-sucking flies that had been living off of Oswaldo’s prey sought out a\nnew host. But predation obviously resonates with hunting as much as it does\nwith a colonial past and the social hierarchies that are its product. Being a\npredator, having to be so, is a frightening prospect, not free of its own\nambivalences.\n\nIf Oswaldo is to be a successful hunter, if he is to continue, it is not\nenough for him to be a predator; he must also be “white.” That is, if whites\nare hunters, which is manifestly true, given their history of preying on the\nRuna—it is the whites who hunted down their forebears with dogs and enslaved\nthem during the rubber boom—then Oswaldo must also occupy this position when\nhe sees himself as an I. The only other choice would be to become an object.\nThe Runa must always already be Runa, puma, as well as “white.”\n\nMore than white, they must, to be more accurate, always already be masters,\namos. Amo means “master,” “lord,” or “boss” in Spanish and has served\ntraditionally as a term of address for estate owners and government officials.\nThe power this title indexes is indelibly linked to whiteness. In the mid-\nnineteenth century, for example, a man of African descent named Goyo was\nappointed governor of the Amazonian administrative region (known at the time\nas Oriente Province). Because this new governor was black, the Runa refused to\ntreat him as a master. He was therefore forced to ask the previous governor,\nManuel Lazerda, to continue as acting governor. As Lazerda recounts:\n\n> The Indians believe that blacks are damned, charred in the infernal fires.\n> They’ll never obey Goyo. I’m his friend and I’ll do his bidding. The\n> earnings [primarily from forced sales to the Indians] will be divided in two\n> parts: one for me, and one for him. Alone he wouldn’t be able to do a thing.\n> The catechized Indians will never recognize him as their apu.\n>\n> —What does apu mean?\n>\n> —Amo, señor. I will be for them their real master and lord. (Avendaño 1985\n> [1861]: 152)\n\nIn Ávila today, amo—amu in Quichua—remains inextricably associated with\nwhites, the “real” masters and lords. But amu has also come to mark another\nI’s perspective as appreciated from an external vantage point. And like “Runa”\nand “puma,” it functions as an “imperfect substitute for a pronoun.” That is,\namu functions as a pronoun, but in the process it pulls in its wake all the\npredicates associated with the colonial history of domination to which it is\nlinked.\n\nHere is how Narcisa employs the term in her reflections on an encounter,\ndiscussed in chapter 3, that she and her family had in the forest with some\nred brocket deer and the propitious dream that preceded it.\n\n> “cunanca huañuchichinga ranita,” yanica amuca\n>\n> “therefore, I’ll be able to make him kill it,” I—the amu—thought\n\nThanks to what, earlier in the conversation she described as her “good\ndreaming,” she felt certain she would easily be able to get her husband to\nkill at least one of the deer they encountered. Amu, here combined with the\ntopic-marking suffix -ca, highlights the fact that her dreaming (and not the\nactions of her husband, as her interlocutors might otherwise expect) was what\nwas important.[11](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn11) Her husband, who was to shoot the\ndeer, was simply a proximate extension of her agency. This is why she—the\namu—is the topic of this phrase. Amuca encourages us to note the not entirely\nexpected fact that we should understand the events of the forest that day as\nrevolving around her agency. Her dreaming self (which her narrating self, from\na somewhat external position, can regard as amu), and not her husband with his\ngun, is the locus of cause. It is no coincidence that a word whose original\nand continuing meaning is “white lord” is used to denote this fact.\n\nBecause all selves and not just human ones are Is, amu also marks the\nsubjective viewpoints of animals. After Maxi described to Luis how he had\nfired at an agouti from his hunting blind, Luis asked him:\n\n> amuca api tucuscachu\n>\n> and the amu [—that is, the agouti—], was he hit?\n\nMaxi responded, “Yeah . . . right in the back bone.” “Tias,” interjected Luis,\nusing a sound image (see chapter 1) that simulates lead shot deftly cutting\nthrough the unfortunate agouti’s flesh and bone—“sliced right\nthrough.”[12](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn12) Amuca in this exchange shifts the topic of\ndiscussion from a focus on Maxi’s action to the fate of the agouti-as-I.\n\nThe term amu, referring to a title that the Runa, as Lazerda observed, would\nbestow only upon a white person, now also refers to any Runa I. But because\nall beings, and not just humans, see themselves as I (and therefore, in a\nsense, also as Runa) it follows that they also all see themselves as masters.\nWhiteness is now understood as inseparable from one’s sense of self when\n“saying” I, even when the one “saying” I is not human.\n\nAmu, like Runa and puma, marks a subject position. And all of these nouns,\nwhich we might otherwise only take to mark, respectively, white, indigenous,\nor animal essences additionally mark a vantage point—the position of the I.\nThe term amu, without losing its historical association to particular people\nwith particular physical characteristics and a particular position in a power\nhierarchy (in fact, because of these accumulated associations), has also come\nto mark any self’s point of view. The living I, the self, any self—qua self—in\nthis ecology of selves, is amu. That self is by definition a master, and\ntherefore in a certain sense “white.”\n\nThis particular “imperfect substitute for a pronoun” has unique qualities.\nAlong with puma (or white), amu invokes hierarchy. But it does so in a way\nthat catapults the self into a plane that goes beyond that of the living. And\nthis fact has important implications for what it is to be an I, in continuity.\n\nLike Oswaldo and his ambivalent relation to the policeman, the Runa both are\nand are obviously not “the masters of everything.” Amu captures something of\nthis disjointed and alienated nature of the self’s relation to itself. The\nmasters have always already been right there, along with the Runa, not just in\nthe realm of the living but also in those realms that span beyond life. The\nspirits, who control the animals and who live in that timeless always already\nrealm deep in the forest, are known by many names in Ávila, but mainly they\nare simply called “the masters”—amu-guna. These forest masters appear to the\nRuna in dreams and visions as white rubber estate bosses or Italian priests.\nIt is from the master’s vantage point—when the Runa manage to inhabit it—that\nthey are able to hunt successfully. When Oswaldo comes to recognize that he is\nthe white policeman of his dream, he is not just becoming one of those\nofficers who walk the streets of the towns of, say, Tena or Coca; he is also\nbecoming a master of the forest and, in the process, inhabiting, in some way\nor another, this realm of the spirits.\n\nThe Runa, as always already Runa, have always already been in such intimate\nrelation with these sorts of figures that populate the timeless realm of the\nmasters. In mythic times the masters were always already there, as a pair of\nChristian apostles, who function as “culture heroes” and who walked the earth\nand guided the Runa.[13](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn13) Being guided by master-apostles\ninvolves a degree of intimacy mixed with separation and alienation. According\nto one diluvial myth, recounted by the early-twentieth-century Napo-area Runa\n(Wavrin 1927: 329), in mythic times the Amazon was inhabited by God and the\nSaints. During the flood God built a steamboat, which he used to escape up to\nheaven along with these Saints. When the flood receded God’s now-abandoned\nboat washed up in the land of the foreigners. By observing this boat, the\nforeigners learned how to make ships as well as other machines. The original\nowners of modern technology may be white deities, but they have also always\nalready been Amazonian and an intimate if also detached aspect of Runa life.\n\nLet me explain what I mean about this relationship between intimacy and\ndetachment. That the Runa are amu when “saying” I (and that they also stand in\nan intimate yet detached and sometimes subservient relation to those amu who\ninhabit an always already realm) distributes the self and marks the pain of\nthose disjunctures that separate its successive instantiations.\n\nRegarding such successive instantiations of the self, linguistic\nanthropologists working with Gê and Tupi Guarani peoples of central Brazilian\nAmazonia have noted that the first-person singular—the I—used in certain\nnarrative performances can sometimes refer to the skin-bound self performing\nthe myth or song. Whereas at other times it can refer to other skin-bound\nselves through quotation, and at still other times to a self that is\ndistributed over a lineage that includes both the performer and the\nperformer’s ancestors (Urban 1989; Graham 1995; Oakdale 2002; see also Turner\n2007). Regarding the latter, Greg Urban (1989: 41) describes how a Shokleng\norigin myth-teller enters a trancelike or possessed state when embodying the I\nof his ancestors. Urban refers to this special kind of self-reference, in\nwhich the self is also a lineage, as a “projective I.” It is projective\nbecause by embodying these “past Is” the narrator also comes to embody the\n“continuity” (45) of his self—a self that has now become part of a more\ngeneral “emergent” lineage of selves (42).[14](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn14) His I\nbecomes an us.\n\nI want to suggest that amu captures something important about this “projective\nI.” It refers to the self in continuity—an “us” with its “indefinite\npossibilities” (Peirce CP 5.402; see chapter 1). This continuity does not just\nstretch back to the ancestors. It also projects into the future. And it also\ncaptures something about how the I is constitutively related to a not-I—to the\nwhites, the spirits, and the dead that the living Runa are but also are not.\n\nBEING IN FUTURO\n\nThe Runa self is always already Runa, puma, and especially always already\nmaster, or amu. This self always has at least one paw in a spirit realm, which\nis neither located just in the present nor the simple product of the\naccretions of its cumulative pasts. There is a formal semiotic logic to this.\nAs I argued in the first chapters of this book signs are alive and all selves,\nhuman and nonhuman, are semiotic. What a self is, in the most minimal sense,\nis a locus—however ephemeral—for sign interpretation. That is, it is a locus\nfor the production of a novel sign (termed an “interpretant”; see chapter 1)\nthat also stands in continuity with those signs that have come before it.\nSelves, human or nonhuman, simple or complex, are waypoints in a semiotic\nprocess. They are outcomes of semiosis as well as the starting points for new\nsign interpretation whose outcome will be a future self. Selves don’t exist\nfirmly in the present; they are “just coming into life in the flow of time”\n(Peirce CP 5.421) by virtue of their dependence on future loci of\ninterpretance—future semiotic selves—that will come to interpret them.\n\nAll semiosis, then, creates future. This is something distinctive about self.\nBeing a semiotic self—whether human or nonhuman—involves what Peirce calls\n“being in futuro” (CP 2.86). That is, in the realm of selves, as opposed to in\nthe inanimate world, it is not just the past that comes to affect the present.\nThe future, as, I discussed in this chapter’s introduction, as it is re-\npresented, also comes to affect the present (CP 1.325; see also CP 6.127 and\n6.70),[15](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn15) and this is central to what a self is. The\nfuture, and how it is brought into the present, is not reducible to the cause-\nand-effect dynamic by which the past affects the present. Signs, as “guesses,”\nre-present a future possible, and through this mediation they bring the future\nto bear on the present. The future’s influence on the present has its own kind\nof reality (see CP 8.330). And it is one that makes selves what they are as\nunique entities in the world.\n\nPeirce refers to the past—the product of causes and effects—as fixed or\n“dead.” Being in futuro, by contrast, is “living” and “plastic” (CP 8.330).\nAll semiosis, as it grows and lives, creates future. This future is virtual,\ngeneral, not necessarily existent, and yet real (CP 2.92). All selves partake\nof this “living future” (CP 8.194). Neotropical forests, such as those around\nÁvila, proliferate semiotic habits to a degree unprecedented in the biological\nworld, and in the process they also proliferate futures. This is what\nhumans—the Runa and others as well—step into when they enter the forest and\nbegin to relate to its beings.\n\nAnd yet the kind of future that humans create is emergent with respect to the\nsorts of futures that characterize the nonsymbolic semiotic world in which\nsuch a future is nested. Like an icon or an index, a symbol must come to be\ninterpreted by a future sign potentially coming into being in order for it to\nfunction as a sign. However, a symbol additionally depends on these future\nsigns for its very qualities: Its “character . . . can only be realized by the\naid of its [i]nterpretant” (CP 2.92). For example, the phonological qualities\nof a word like dog are arbitrary and are only fixed by virtue of the\nconventional relation the word has to a vast virtual, ethereal, and yet real\nrealm of other such words (and their contrastive phonological qualities) that\nprovide the context for its apperception and interpretation (see CP 2.304; see\nalso 2.292–93). By contrast icons and indices retain their qualities (but not\ntheir ability to function as signs) independent of their intepretants. An\nicon, such as the Quichua sound image “tsupu,” would retain the sonic\nqualities that make it significant, even, without the existence of those\nentities that plunge—tsupu—into water or whether it is ever interpreted to\nsound like such plunging entities. Although the qualities that make an index\nsignificant depend on some sort of correlation with its object of reference,\nlike an icon it would retain these characteristics even when it is not\ninterpreted as a sign. A palm tree crashing down in the forest would still\nmake a sound even when no one—not even a skittish woolly monkey—is around to\ntake this crash to be an index of danger (see chapter 1). In sum, unlike an\nicon or index, a symbol’s very being qua symbol relies on the emergence of a\nwhole host of not necessarily existent and yet real signs that will come to\ninterpret it. It is doubly dependent on the future.\n\nThe realm of the masters amplifies this being in futuro logic, which is\ncentral to all of semiotic life, at the same time that it is also made into\nsomething else by human symbolic semiosis. For Oswaldo to remain a living\nsign, he must be able to be interpretable by this virtual, yet real, realm of\nthe masters—a realm where he needs to be treated as an I and not an it to\nsurvive. He must, in short, be capable of being hailed by a master as a you.\nAnd this will only be possible when in the realm of the masters he too\nactually becomes an I, in futuro.\n\nThis virtual realm of the masters is physically located deep in the forest. It\nemerges out of the forest’s living ecology of selves—an ecology that is itself\ncreating proliferating networks of futures. These proliferating networks come\nto shape the future realm of the masters. And so this spirit realm comes to\ncapture the logic of a “living future” in a way that cannot just be explained\nin terms of the language or culture of its human participants. And this makes\nthis realm more than a symbolic gloss on a nonsymbolic nonhuman world.\n\nAmu, I want to suggest, is a particular colonially inflected way of being a\nself in an ecology of selves filled with a growing array of future-making\nhabits, many of which are not human. In the process, amu renders visible how a\nliving future gives life some of its special properties and how this involves\na dynamic that implicates (but is not reducible to) the past. In doing so,\namu, and the spirit realm upon which it draws its power, amplifies something\ngeneral about life—namely, life’s quality of being in futuro. And it ratchets\nthis quality up a notch; the spirit realm of the masters is “more” in futuro\nthan life itself. The realm of the spirits amplifies and generalizes this\nliving-future logic, and it brings it to bear on an everyday political and\nexistential problem: survival.\n\nAFTERLIFE\n\nRegarding the view of the afterlife held by one eighteenth-century Upper\nAmazonian group known as the Peba, the Jesuit missionary priest Juan Magnin\n(1988 [1740]: 477) reported with exasperation, “Their take on the matter is\nunequivocal. They say . . . they are all Saints; and that none of them will go\nto Hell, instead they’ll all go to heaven, where their relatives are, Saints\nlike them.” Missionaries had little trouble getting the forebears of the Runa\nand other Upper Amazonians such as the Peba to comprehend heaven. And yet, to\ntheir continuing chagrin, they found that the locals insisted on understanding\nthis afterlife realm as unfolding in a forest of all-too-earthly plenty—one\nthat, according to a bemused missionary working among the Runa, has “rivers\nthat contain more fish than water” and, most important, “astronomical\nquantities” of manioc beer (Porras 1955: 153). Seventeenth- and eighteenth-\ncentury accounts resonate with contemporary ones: This “other life,” where the\nIndians “never die” (Figueroa 1986 [1661]: 282), provides “manioc in great\nabundance, and meat and drink as much as they wish” (Magnin 1988 [1740]:\n477).[16](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn16) It is one with “no lack of steel axes and trade\nbeads, monkeys, drinking parties, flutes and drums” (Magnin 1988 [1740]: 490;\nsee also Maroni 1988 [1738]: 173).\n\nHell is an altogether different matter. It has been a continuing source of\nconcern for missionaries, from Father Magnin’s time and even earlier, that\nmany Upper Amazonians were unwilling to conceive of damnation in Hell as a\nform of personal punishment for worldly sins. For the Runa, as many reports\nover the years attest, there simply is no Hell.[17](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn17) Hell,\naccording to them, is where others suffer, especially whites and\nblacks.[18](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn18)\n\nAfter Ventura’s mother, Rosa, died she went “inside” to the world of the\nspirit masters (see chapters 3 and 5). She married one of those lords and\nbecame one of them—an amu. Her old sagging body—sloughed off like a snake’s\nskin—was all that she left behind for her children to bury. Ventura’s mother\nhad died quite old, but now, her son explained, she lives eternally young in\nthe realm of the masters. “[F]ire escapes old as you,” wrote Allen Ginsberg,\nin his irreverent prayer poem mourning his own mother, “–Tho you’re not old\nnow, that’s left here with me.” Ventura’s mother too was not old now. Never to\ndie again, and never to suffer, she had become again—and now forever—like her\npubescent granddaughters.[19](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn19) All that was left with her\nson was her aged body, decrepit like a rusted fire escape.\n\nBy becoming a master, Rosa, in a sense, became a Saint. She went to live\nforever in that realm of eternal abundance, full of game and beer and worldly\nriches, in that Quito deep inside the forest. She would never to go to Hell,\nshe would never again suffer, and she would be forever free. As I discussed in\nthe previous chapter, Rosa entered inside a form—that always already realm of\nthe masters—where the impacts of time, the past’s effects on the present,\nbecome less relevant. But Rosa is not the only Saint: “we are all Saints,”\ninsisted the Peba Indians who so frustrated the eighteenth-century Jesuit\nmissionary.\n\nI want to unpack this suggestion that Rosa is a Saint, and I want to even\nexplore the possibility that we selves might all be Saints. I do so by\nattending to the relation that selves like Rosa have to the emergent virtual\nand “in futuro” realm of the masters. This is a realm of future possibility in\nwhich what it is to be an I, a self, is also shaped by the many kinds of dead,\ntheir many kinds of bodies, and the histories of their many deaths. That Rosa\nreally continues on as a master, and perhaps as a Saint, however, is not just\nthe direct effect of these others. For her continuity only becomes possible by\nvirtue of a negative relation to them. It is an outcome that is not directly\naffected by the palpable presences of all those others but by their\nconstitutive absences. I hope this will become clearer in the section that\nfollows.\n\nTHE IMPONDERABLE WEIGHT OF THE DEAD\n\nOne day Juanicu went out with his dogs to the forest to collect worms for fish\nbait when he was badly mauled by a giant anteater. He nearly died from his\nwounds. Giant anteaters, known to rear up on their hind legs and slash out\nwith the large curved claws of their forefeet when threatened, are truly\nformidable creatures; even jaguars are said to fear them (see chapter 3).\nJuanicu alternated between blaming his misfortune on a rival shaman with whom\nhe has had an ongoing feud and, more mundanely, on his dogs, who led him to\nthe animal (they were supposed to have stayed at home). Juanicu never blamed\nhimself, nor did anyone else. Juanicu-as-I can never do himself harm. Only\nothers can.\n\nA young Ávila man, of whom I was very fond, was killed on the Huataracu River.\nThey pulled out his body from the bottom of a deep pool. His chest was ripped\nopen. He died while fishing with dynamite. No one doubted that. There was much\nless agreement as to the ultimate, or even proximate, cause of his death. Some\nblamed sorcerers and the darts and anacondas they sometimes send when\nattacking their enemies. Others blamed those responsible for the circumstances\nthat led him to fish with dynamite on that day: a demanding brother-in-law;\nthe fellow who gave him the dynamite; or the folks who took him out to the\nriver. All established culpability with one person or another. Of the half\ndozen or so different explanations I heard, none put blame on the young man\nwho died.\n\nOmens reveal a similar logic. If the camarana pishcu, a kind of\nantshrike[20](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn20) that eats insects flushed by moving army\nant colonies, is found flying around a house, someone will die; for this is\nhow a child circles around her house crying inconsolably when she discovers\nthat her mother or father is dead. The “grave digger”\nwasp[21](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn21) is known as such because it buries the\ntarantulas and large spiders it paralyzes (see Hogue 1993:417), throwing up\nfresh piles of red earth in the process, as if digging a grave. As with the\nantshrike, finding one of these near home is an omen that a relative will die.\nPeople in Ávila call such signs (and there are many)[22](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn22)\ntapia, bad omens. I first thought of these as omens of death, but I soon\nrealized that they refer to something more specific: it is not death that they\nforetell but the deaths of others. In fact, they never augur the death of the\nperson who finds them.\n\nThese examples say something about the counterintuitive relation of the self\nto that which it is not. Death for the self is ineffable, for the self is\nsimply a continuation of life. The self is a general (see chapter 1). It is\nthe experience of the death of others by the living that is so hard to bear,\nbecause it is what is palpable. “The thread of life is a third,” wrote Peirce,\nwhereas “the fate that snips it” is “its second” (CP 1.337; see also chapter\n1).\n\nThe omens of mourning I have been discussing speak to the pain associated with\nanother becoming other—a second, a thing—another that is no longer an I, no\nlonger a possible part of a becoming-us-in-relation, or at least not for the\nmoment. For the living mourners, death marks a rupture: the dead become shuc\ntunu or shican (different, other). The myth of the man being eaten alive by\nthe juri juri demon that I recounted in chapter 3 explores the terrifying\nprospect of coming to experience oneself as such an object—an experience we\nwill never have when we become objects.\n\nBut souls do not simply die; they can continue in that virtual future realm\nthat living (and its attendant deaths) creates. The traditional kaddish—as\nopposed to Ginsberg’s irreverent version—the Jewish prayer recited in memory\nof the dead, never mentions death.[23](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn23) Death can only be\nexperienced from outside. Only others can snip at the thread of life. And only\nothers, for the Runa, other kinds of people, especially blacks and whites (in\nthe essentialist sense), go to Hell.\n\nThe self is always partially invisible to oneself in the sense that visibility\nrequires objectification—secondness—and secondness misses something crucial\nabout what a living self is. The I is an I because it is in form—because it\npartakes in a general mode of being that exceeds any particular instantiation\nof itself. That Rosa will become a master (and a Saint) is what makes her a\nliving self. An anthropology that focuses on difference—one that focuses on\nthe “nots” and the “seconds” (see chapter 2)—cannot attend to this invisible\ncontinuity of the self.\n\nIn a similar fashion, although it is true that walking sticks are invisible\nthanks to a specific relation they have to all of their more visible and less\ntwiggy relatives that were noticed, just focusing on those objectified others\nmisses the continuing persistence of the invisible I in a form that, in\nhindsight, leaves us with a visible proliferation of something general that,\nin this case we can call “twigginess.”\n\nAll signs involve a relationship to something not present. Icons do this in a\nway that is fundamental to their being. Recall from previous chapters that,\nalthough we generally think of it in terms of likeness, iconicity is really\nthe product of what is not noticed. (For example, that we don’t at first\nnotice the difference between a walking stick and a twig.) Indices, by\ncontrast, point to changes in present circumstances—that there is something\nother to which we must attend (another kind of absence). Symbols incorporate\nthese features but in a special way: they represent via their relation to an\nabsent system of other such symbols that make them meaningful.\n\nLife, being intrinsically semiotic, has a related association to absence. What\na living organism-in-lineage, in-continuity-of-I—to use the Amazonian\nconcept—is, is the product of what it is not. It is intimately related to the\nmany absent lineages that did not survive, which were selected out to reveal\nthe forms that fit the world around them. In a sense, the living, like the\nwalking stick we mistake for a twig, are the ones that were not noticed. They\nare the ones that continue to potentially persist in form and out of time\nthanks to their relationship to what they are not. Note the logical shift: the\nfocus is on what is not present: the imponderable “weight” (I think the\noxymoron captures something of the counterintuitive nature of this claim) of\nthe dead.\n\nAll of life, then, houses, by virtue of these constitutive absences, the\ntraces of all that has come before it—the traces of that which it is not. The\ninvisible realm of the masters makes, to follow the counterintuitive logic,\nall of this visible. It is in the realm of the masters that the traces of\nthose who have lived (the pre-Hispanic chiefs, the black-robed priests, the\ngrandparents and parents) and that which has happened (the great sixteenth-\ncentury uprising against the Spaniards, the circulation of the old trade\nbeads, the forced tribute payments) continue. And this is the future realm,\nthe realm that gives interpretability to the (human) living one as well. The\nrealm of the masters houses all of the specters of the past. And it is in this\nrealm that the timeless I continues, by virtue of its intimate relation to\nthese absences.\n\nThe I is in form and outside of history (see chapter 5). This is why nothing\ncan happen to it. Heaven is a continuation of form. Hell is history; it is\nwhat happens to others. Heaven is a realm where people are not subject to\ntime. They never age. They never die there. Only its can be in time. Only they\ncan be affected, subject to dyadic cause-and-effect, out of form, subject to\nhistory—punished.\n\nTHE YOU OF THE SELF\n\nThe realm of the masters is the product of the many futures created by the\nforest. But it is more than this. A word depends for its meaning on the\nemergence of a vast symbolic system that will come to interpret it. Something\nlike this is happening in the forest as well. The realm of the masters is that\nvast virtual system that emerges as humans—in their distinctly human\nways—attempt to engage with the other-than-human semiosis of the forest. The\nrealm of the masters, then, is like a language. Except it is more “fleshly”\n(Haraway 2003) than a language—being, as it is, caught up in vaster swaths of\nnonhuman semiosis. It is also at the same time more ethereal. It is a realm\nthat is in the forest but also beyond nature and the human. It is, in a word,\n“supernatural.”\n\nThis spirit realm of masters comes to interpret, and thus permits and\nconstrains, who and how an I can be, at the same time that it provides the\nvessel for the continuity—the survival—of that I. In Ávila, whiteness has come\nto mark this I point of view. It marks a relative position within a hierarchy\nthat spans the cosmos—a hierarchy that ranges from the nonhuman to the human\nrealm and from the human one to the realm of the spirits. Therein lies\nOswaldo’s predicament. On the one hand, the Runa have always already been\nwhite. On the other hand, they recognize a variety of beings—policemen,\npriests, and landowners, as well as animal masters and demons—whose superior\nposition in a historically inflected cosmic hierarchy is indexed by their\nwhiteness.\n\nThis realm of the masters, however, is not just about the I. “Between the\nreflexive ‘I’ of culture,” writes Viveiros de Castro (and by “culture,” I take\nhim to mean the vantage from which a self sees herself as such, sees herself,\nthat is, as a person), “and the impersonal ‘it’ of nature, there is a position\nmissing, the ‘you’, the second person, or the other taken as other subject,\nwhose point of view is the latent echo of that of the ‘I’” (1998: 483). This\nyou, for Viveiros de Castro, gets at something important about the\nsupernatural realm—a realm, I would add, that is not just reducible to nature,\nnor is it one that is reducible to culture. It is a realm that, according to a\nformal hierarchical logic, is situated “above” the human realm it makes\npossible.\n\n“Supernature,” continues Viveiros de Castro, “is the form of the Other as\nSubject” (1998: 483). I would say that it is the place where one can be called\ninto being by this higher-order other self that is both strange and familiar.\nThis is the realm from which Oswaldo’s policeman hailed him. It is also the\nrealm where all selves can experience themselves as masters—amu. So when the\nterm amu is used in Ávila, whether in self-reference as in Narcisa’s case or\nto refer to a being, human or nonhuman, that is properly other, it is done\nprecisely to invoke this other I, taken as other subject—one whose voice,\nhowever faint, is a “latent echo” of the I in futuro.\n\nThe challenge is to avoid becoming an object in the process of this\ninterpellation. And this is a real danger. Fear of this is what led Oswaldo to\ninitially conclude that he had dreamed badly when he dreamed of seeing the\npoliceman greet him with hair clippings on his shoulders. It is also why one\ncannot, for example, look at a huaturitu supai, the bird-clawed demon garbed\nin priestly robes that wanders the forests clutching a Bible. For becoming a\nyou of that I would permanently transport you out of the realm of the living\n(Taylor 1993; Viveiros de Castro 1998: 483). And yet a self that is not\ndestabilized by the its and yous that it constantly confronts, a self that\ndoes not grow to incorporate these into a larger us, is not a living I but a\ndead shell of one.\n\nThe question for the Runa, then, is how to create the conditions that will\nassure that they can continue to inhabit an I point of view. How, that is, to\nget into this higher-order you that both is but is never fully one’s I? The\ntechniques they use to do this are shamanic. Such techniques extend a paw into\nthe future in order to bring some of that future back to the realm of the\nliving.\n\nI want to emphasize that the historical condition of possibility for shamanism\nis the very hierarchy it attempts to tap. Without the colonially inflected\npredatory hierarchy that structures the ecology of selves, there is no higher\nposition one can enter from which to frame one’s own. Emblematic of how\nshamanism relates to the history of hierarchies in which it is immersed is the\nterm miricu, one of the names for “shaman” in Ávila.[24](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn24)\nThe power of this term resides in the fact that it is a bilingual pun. As\nsuch, it captures two concepts in two different registers simultaneously; it\nis a Quichua-ization of the Spanish word for doctor (médico) and it contains\nthe Quichua verb “to see” (ricuna), in its agentive form; ricu is a seer.\nShamans can see like doctors, those vanguards of modernity armed with all the\npowerful weapons of medical science. But this does not necessarily imply a\ndesire to become like a Western doctor. Shamanistic seeing changes what it\nmeans to see.\n\nHow does one inhabit the you perspective? How does one make it one’s own I?\nOne does so by donning what we might call clothing—the equipment, bodily\naccouterments, and attributes that allow a particular kind of being to inhabit\na particular kind of world. Such equipment includes the canines and pelts of\nthe jaguar (see Wavrin 1927: 328), the pants of the white man (see also Vilaça\n2007, 2010),[25](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn25) the robes of the priest, and the face\npaints of the “Auca.” And such clothing can also be shed. Rosa sloughed off\nher aged body when she died. And it is reported in Ávila that some men,\nencountering jaguars in the forest and unable to scare them off, have\nundressed themselves to battle them. In this way, the jaguar is forced to\nrecognize that his power comes from his clothing and that underneath this he\nis a person.[26](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn26) This is why jaguars, as Amériga\nfantasized with vengeful glee after her dogs were killed by one of them, so\nfear the sound of machetes slicing “tlin tilin” through the vegetation of the\nforest. For this reminds the jaguars of just how effortless it would be for\npeople to slice through their cushma, or tunic,[27](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn27) which\nis the kind of clothing jaguars take their hides to\nbe.[28](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn28)\n\nAnother set of examples of shamanic equipment. At a wedding, a man from a\nnearby Runa community approached me and, without a word, began to rub his\nsmooth cheek against my beard stubble. Soon after, another young man\napproached and asked me to impart some of my “shamanic knowledge” by blowing\non the crown of his head.[29](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn29) On a number of occasions\nwhen we were sitting around drinking beer older men would suddenly put on my\nbackpack and strut around and then ask me to take a picture of them carrying\nmy pack as well as other kinds of equipment: a shotgun, an ax, a pail of\nmanioc beer. And one man asked me to take a portrait of his family, with\neveryone dressed in their best clothing, and he, wearing my\nbackpack.[30](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn30) These are all little shamanic acts—attempts\nto appropriate something of what is imagined as a more powerful you.\n\nI want to make clear here that it is not that the Runa want to become white in\nany sort of acculturative sense. For this is not a matter of acquiring a\nculture. Nor is the whiteness of whites intrinsically fixed. This is not about\nrace. The Spaniard Jiménez de la Espada learned this on a visit he made in the\n1860s to the Runa of San José de Mote, a now-abandoned village located in the\nfoothills of Sumaco Volcano about a day’s walk from Ávila.\n\n> The women, despite my generosity in distributing crosses, medallions, and\n> beads, when I jokingly told them that I would like to marry one of them,\n> they replied that who would want that, since I was not Christian. . . . I\n> was a devil. (Jiménez de la Espada 1928: 473)\n\nAlthough the Runa depend on various kinds of white equipment in order to be\nand to continue as persons, they do not always extend such personhood to the\nactual whites they encounter. White is a relational category, not an\nessentialist one. The jaguar doesn’t always have the canines, and the whites\naren’t always the masters.\n\nTHE LIVING FUTURE\n\nThat Oswaldo managed to kill the peccary instantiated—brought into existence—a\nheretofore only virtual real, which made that act possible. Oswaldo became the\npoliceman that day in the forest, and in the process he brought back something\nof that future realm—ambiguously adumbrated in his dream—into the world of the\npresent. The realm of the masters is real. It is real because it can come to\ninform existence, and it is real as a general possibility not reducible to\nthat which will have happened. Reality is more than that which exists. The\nrealm of the masters is something more than human and cultural, and yet it\nemerges from a specifically human way of engaging and relating to a living\nworld that lies in part beyond the human.\n\nSpirits are real (see also Chakrabarty 2000; de la Cadena 2010; Singh 2012).\nHow we treat this reality is as important as recognizing it as such; otherwise\nwe risk taking spirits to be a kind of real—the kind that is socially or\nculturally constructed—that is “all too human” and all too familiar. I concur\nthat gods emerge with human practice (Chakrabarty 1997: 78), but that does not\nmake them reducible to or circumscribed by the human contexts in which such\npractices unfold.\n\nThe spirit realm of the masters of the forest has its own kind of general\nreality: it is the emergent product of the relation it has to life’s living\nfuture and it “ratchets up” some of the properties that life harbors.\nProperties like generality itself, constitutive absence, continuity across\ndisjuncture, and a disruption of cause-and-effect temporal dynamics become so\namplified in the realm of the masters that they become, in a sense, visible\neven in their invisibility.\n\nAppreciating how spirits are their own kind of real is important for an\nanthropology that will be capable of attending to the human in relation to\nthat which lies beyond it. But to do so one must be willing to say something\ngeneral about what makes spirits real—something that includes but also goes\nbeyond the fact that other people take them to be real, that we should take\nthat fact seriously, and that we should even be open to how these kinds of\nreals might affect us (see, e.g., Nadasdy 2007).\n\nIn treating the realm of the masters housed deep in the forests around Ávila\nas an emergent real, my wish is to rediscover the world’s enchantment. The\nworld is animate, whether or not we are animists. It is filled with selves—I\ndaresay souls—human and otherwise. And it is not just located in the here and\nnow, or in the past, but in a being in futuro—a potential living future. A\nspecific comingling of human and nonhuman souls creates this enchanted realm\nof the spirit masters in the forests around Ávila—a realm that is reducible\nneither to the forest nor to the cultures and histories of those humans who\nrelate to it, even though it does emerge from these and cannot persist without\nthem.\n\nLiving selves create future. Human living selves create even more future. The\nrealm of the masters is the emergent product of a human way of living in a\nworld beyond the human. It is the product of so much interspecies relating,\ncoming together as so often it does, in the hunt. It houses all that future-\nmaking in a way that is general, invisible, and haunted by all the dead. It\nis, perhaps, the future’s future.\n\nIn that future—that super-nature—lies the possibility for a living future. In\nkilling that pig and not being killed, Oswaldo survived. To survive is to live\nbeyond life: super \\+ vivre. But one survives not only in relationship to life\nbut in relation to its many absences as well. “To survive,” according to the\nOxford English Dictionary, means, “To continue to live after the death of\nanother, or after the end or cessation of some thing or condition or the\noccurrence of some event (expressed or implied).” Life grows in relationship\nto that which it is not.[31](Notes.xhtml#ch6fn31)\n\nThe fractured and yet necessary relationship between the mundane present and\nthe general future plays out in specific and painful ways in what Lisa\nStevenson (2012; see Butler 1997) might call the “psychic life” of the Runa\nself, immersed and informed, as it is, by the colonially inflected ecology of\nselves in which it lives. The Runa are both of and alienated from the realm of\nthe spirit world, and survival requires cultivating ways to allow something of\none’s future self—living tenuously in the realm of the forest masters—to look\nback on that more mundane part of oneself who might then hopefully respond.\nThis ethereal realm of continuity and possibility is the emergent product of a\nwhole host of trans-species and transhistorical relations. It is the product\nof the imponderable weight of the many dead that make a living future\npossible.\n\nOswaldo’s challenge of surviving as an I, as it was revealed in his dream and\nas it plays out in this ecology of selves, depends on how he is hailed by\nothers. These others may be human or nonhuman, fleshly or virtual; they all in\nsome way make Oswaldo who he is. Oswaldo’s survival—like Rosa’s ongoing\npresence in that Quito deep in the forest—speaks to the puzzles of life that\nthe forest amplifies; it speaks to the continual emergence of lineage out of\nthe configuration of the individuals that instantiate them (see chapter 5).\nAnd it speaks to the creation of a form that stands in constitutive absence to\nthat which it is not.\n\nThe soul, nonspecific and yet real, lives in such a continuity of form (see\nPeirce CP 7.591; see also chapter 3). The soul is general. Bodies (situated,\nequipped, erring, animal—not here to be confused with animate) individuate\n(see Descola 2005: 184–85, citing Durkheim). This gets at something about\nliving futures. For life, in some way or another, is always about this sort of\ncontinuity across disjuncture that souls exemplify.\n\nAnd what of this particular future’s future? That which plays out in the\nneotropical forests around Ávila? What of the future of a future whose\ninstantiation and continuing possibility is premised on killing some of those\nbeings that a dense ecology of selves harbors? The emergence of the spirit\nrealm of the masters of the forest is the product of the relationships among\nthe many kinds of selves that make up this thinking forest. Some of these\nrelationships are filial, others rhizomatic; some are vertical, others\nlateral; some are arborescent, others reticulate; some are parasitic, others\npredatory; and, finally, some are with strangers, and others, with those that\nare intimately familiar.\n\nThis vast but fragile realm of relating, played out in the forest and in that\nfuture realm that houses the forest’s many pasts, is a world of possibility as\nlong as not too many of these relations are killed. Killing, as Haraway (2008)\npoints out, is not the same as killing a relation. And killing may actually\npermit a kind of relationship. Once the killing ends a larger, much more\nlasting silence may well follow. The Runa have an intimate relationship with\nthe forest and with a kind of animacy that enchants the world because they\nkill—because they are part of this vast ecology of selves in this way. And\nkilling and killing relationship are two different things, just as are\nindividual and kind, token and type, life and afterlife. In all of these\ninstances the first is something specific, the second general; all of these\nare real. It is by attentively engaging with the many kinds of real others\nthat people this thinking forest—the animals, the dead, the spirits—that this\nanthropology beyond the human can learn to think about a living future in\nrelation to the deaths that make that future possible.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n![](images/img_0018.jpg)\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n* * *\n\nBeyond\n\nAnimals came from over the horizon. They belonged there and here. Likewise\nthey were mortal and immortal. An animal’s blood flowed like human blood, but\nits species was undying and each lion was Lion, each ox was Ox.\n\n—John Berger, Why Look at Animals?\n\nBeyond the horizon there lies a Lion, a Lion more Lion than any mere lion. And\nbeyond saying “lion,” which calls forth that Lion, lies yet another, who might\njust look back. And beyond this eyeing one, lies an undying one, one we call\n“Lion” because she is a kind.\n\nWhy ask anthropology to look beyond the human? And why look to animals to do\nso? Looking at animals, who look back at us, and who look with us, and who are\nalso, ultimately, part of us, even though their lives extend well beyond us,\ncan tell us something. It can tell us about how that which lies “beyond” the\nhuman also sustains us and makes us the beings we are and those we might\nbecome.\n\nSomething of the living lion can persist beyond its individual death in a\nlineage of Lion to which it also contributes. And this reality lies beyond a\nrelated one that it sustains: when we speak the word lion it contributes to,\nat the same time that it draws on, a general concept—Lion—to invoke a living\nlion. So, beyond the uttered “lion” (technically a “token”) lies the concept\n(the “type”) Lion; and beyond that concept lies a living lion; and beyond any\nsuch individual lion lies a kind (or species or lineage)—a Lion—that both\nemerges from and sustains the many lives of these many lions.\n\nI want to reflect on this idea of a beyond and how it figures in an\nanthropology beyond the human. I opened this book with an Amazonian Sphinx, a\npuma, who also looks back and who thus forces us to think about how to account\nanthropologically for the reality of a kind of regard that extends beyond\nhuman ways of looking. This led me to rethink the riddle that antiquity’s\nSphinx posed to Oedipus: What goes on four in the morning, on two at noon, and\non three in the evening? And I approached this riddle with a question of my\nown: What difference does it make that the Sphinx’s question is posed from\nsomewhere (slightly) beyond the human? How Forests Think investigates\nethnographically why it matters to see things from the Sphinx’s point of view.\n\nThat Sphinx beckons us to think with images. And this, ultimately, is what How\nForests Think is about: learning to think with images. The Sphinx’s question\nis an image, a likeness of its answer, one that is thus a kind of icon. The\nriddle is like a mathematical equation. Consider something as simple as 2 + 2\n+ 2 = 6. Because the terms on either side of the equals sign are iconic of\neach other, learning to see “six” as three “twos” tells us something new about\nthe number 6 (see Peirce CP 2.274–302).\n\nWe can learn something by examining the way the Sphinx’s question, as icon,\nimpels us to notice new things about Oedipus’s answer, the “human.” Her\nquestion can draw our attention to the animality we share with other living\nbeings (our four-legged legacy) despite our all-too-human symbolic (and hence\nmoral, linguistic, and sociocultural) ways of being in the world (captured in\nthe image of our two-legged human gait). And it can help us notice what the\nkind of life that extends beyond the human (“four in the morning”) and the\nkind that is all-too-human (“two at noon”) share in common: that “three-\nlegged” elder-and-his-cane (whom we might learn to appreciate as “mortal and\nimmortal,” self-and-object) invokes three key attributes we share with other\nliving beings. These are finitude, semiotic mediation (the “cane” we living\nbeings all use as we feel our ways through our finite lives), and—I can now\nadd—a peculiar sort of “thirdness” unique to life. This kind of thirdness is\nthe general quality of being in futuro, which captures the logic of life’s\ncontinuity and how this continuity is made possible thanks to the room each of\nour individual deaths can make for the lives of others. The image of hobbling\noff “over the horizon” houses this “living future” as well.\n\nThinking with images, as I do here with the Sphinx’s riddle, and as I do\nthroughout this book, with all kinds of images—be they oneiric, aural,\nanecdotal, mythic, or even photographic (there are other stories being “told”\nhere without words)—and learning to attend to the ways in which these images\namplify, and thus render apparent, something about the human via that which\nlies beyond the human, is, as I’ve been arguing, also a way of opening\nourselves to the distinctive iconic logics of how the forest’s thoughts might\nthink their ways through us. How Forests Think aims to think like forests: in\nimages.\n\nTurning our attention to the Sphinx, making her, not Oedipus, the protagonist\nin our story, asks us to look anthropologically beyond the human. This is no\neasy task. Chapter 1, “The Open Whole,” charted an approach for doing so by\nfinding a way to recognize semiosis as something that extends beyond the\nsymbolic (that distinctively human semiotic modality that makes language,\nculture, and society, as we know them, possible). Learning to see the symbolic\nas just one kind of representational modality within the broader semiotic\nfield within which it is nested, allows us to appreciate the fact that we live\nin sociocultural worlds—“complex wholes”—that, despite their holism, are also\n“open” to that which lies beyond them.\n\nBut recognizing such an open only impels us to ask: What is this world beyond\nus and the sociocultural worlds we construct? And so the second part of the\nfirst chapter turned to a reflection on how we might think about reality as\nsomething that extends beyond the two kinds of real that our dualistic\nmetaphysics provides us: our distinctively human socioculturally constructed\nrealities, on the one hand, and the objective “stuff” that exists out there\nbeyond us, on the other.\n\nIt is no coincidence that I speak here with my hands to describe the choices\nthis dualistic metaphysics affords. For this dualism is as deeply ingrained in\nwhat it means to be human as is our human tendency to think in terms of the\nright and left hands (see Hertz 2007). And it is no coincidence that I placed\nthe realm of society and culture on the first, and hence the right, hand and\nrelegated the realm of things to the second hand—the hand we consider to be\nthe weaker, illegitimate, and sinister (from the Latin for “left”) one. For it\nis that which we take to be human (our souls, our minds, or our cultures) that\ncurrently dominates our dualistic thinking. And this consigns the realm of the\nothers, the nonhumans (evacuated of animacy, agency, or enchantment) to the\nleft hand (a hand that, nonetheless, has its own subversive possibilities; see\nHertz 2007; Ochoa 2007).\n\nThis dualism is not just a sociocultural product of a particular time or\nplace; it goes “hand in hand” with being human, given that our propensity for\ndualism (our “twoness,” in the Sphinx’s terms) is the product of the\ndistinctive properties of human symbolic thought and the ways in which the\nlogic inherent to that kind of thinking creates systems of signs that can come\nto seem radically separate from their worldly referents.\n\nThinking in twos, then, is ingrained in what it means to be human, and moving\nbeyond this kind of handedness requires a real feat of defamiliarizing the\nhuman. That is, it requires us to undertake an arduous process of decolonizing\nour thinking. It asks us to “provincialize” language in order to make room for\nanother kind of thought—a kind of thought that is more capacious, one that\nholds and sustains the human. This other kind of thinking is the one that\nforests do, the kind of thinking that thinks its way through the lives of\npeople, like the Runa (and others), who engage intimately with the forest’s\nliving beings in ways that amplify life’s distinctive logics.\n\nThose living beings enchant and animate the forest. My claim about the reality\nof enchantment and animism beyond the human, and my attempt to flesh it out\nand mobilize it conceptually in an anthropological approach that can take us\nbeyond the human, is my left-handed offering to counter what we take to be the\n“right” ways to think the human.\n\nChapter 2, “The Living Thought,” sought to unpack the claim that lives, and\nhence forests, think. That is, it looked to forms of representation—forms of\nthought—beyond language, with specific attention to the domain beyond the\nhuman in which these exist. When we focus only on the ways in which\ndistinctively human thoughts relate symbolically—which informs linguistic,\ncultural, and social relationality and how we think about it—we miss something\nof the broader associational logic of “living thoughts.” That nonhuman living\nbeings are constitutively semiotic makes them selves. These nonhuman selves\nthink, and their thinking is a form of association that also creates relations\namong selves. Attending to this other form of thought as a kind of relation,\nfeeling it even, at times, emerge as its own conceptual object, and opening\nourselves to its strange properties (such as the generative possibilities\ninherent to confusion or in-distinction), propels us to imagine an\nanthropology that can go beyond difference as its atomic relational component.\n\n“The Living Thought,” then, established why it is so important that\nanthropology look beyond the human toward life. In chapter 3, “Soul\nBlindness,” I began to observe how the death beyond life is also central to\nlife. My focus here was on how death becomes a problem—a “difficulty of\nreality”—intrinsic to life, and how the Runa struggle to find ways to come to\nterms with this.\n\n“Trans-Species Pidgins” is a pivotal chapter. Having ventured beyond the\nhuman, and without losing sight of what that offers, I steered this\nanthropology back to the “all too human”—clarifying why this approach that I\nadvocate is an anthropological approach, and not, say, an ecological one that\nagnostically charts multispecies relations. In the Runa’s journeys beyond the\nhuman, in their struggles to communicate with those animals and spirits that\n“people” that vast ecology of selves that extends beyond them, they don’t want\nto stop being human. Accordingly, this chapter traced ethnographically the\nkinds of strategies necessary to move beyond human modes of communication in\nways that also secure a space for a distinctively human way of being.\n\nCentral to our distinctive ways of being human (which result from our\npropensity to think through symbols) is that we humans, as opposed to other\nkinds of living beings, are moral creatures. This is something that is not\nlost on the Runa as they struggle to get by in an ecology of selves that is\neverywhere shot through with the legacies of an all-too-human colonial\nhistory. Put simply, we cannot afford to ignore this all-too-human realm as we\nmove beyond the human. That said, learning to attend to the kinds of lives\nthat exist beyond the human (and beyond the moral), in ways that allow the\nlogics of life beyond the human to work their ways through us, is itself an\nethical practice.\n\nIn its attempt to relate the all too human to that which lies beyond the\nhuman, “Trans-Species Pidgins” also reveals something about the concept\n“beyond” as an analytic. “Beyond,” as I deploy it, exceeds, at the same time\nthat it is continuous with, its subject matter; an anthropology beyond the\nhuman is still about the human, even though and precisely because it looks to\nthat which lies beyond it—a “beyond” that also sustains the human.\n\nIf much of this book has been about moving beyond the human to the realm of\nlife, chapter 5, “Form’s Effortless Efficacy,” sought to move beyond the realm\nof life to the strange workings of form that sustain both human and nonhuman\nlife. This chapter, then, looked to the particular properties of pattern\ngeneration and propagation and how these change our understanding of causality\nand agency. It argued that form is its own kind of real, one that emerges in\nthe world and is amplified thanks to the distinctive manner in which humans\nand nonhumans harness it.\n\nChapter 6, “The Living Future (and the Imponderable Weight of the Dead),”\nturned to the afterlife of the spirit realm that lies beyond the realm of the\nliving. Its primary task was to understand how this realm says something about\nthe way life itself continues beyond the living bodies that breathe that life.\n(Spirit, I should note, is etymologically related to breath, and in Quichua,\nsamai, breath, is what animates.) The last chapter, then, ventured beyond the\nexistent into the “general.” Generals are real; spirits, and even Sphinxes,\nare real. So are Lions. This chapter, then, is, one might say, about the\nreality of Lion as both kind and type. Lion as “kind” (or species, or lineage)\nis the product of life broadly construed, whereas Lion as “type” is the\nproduct of a human symbolic form of life. And this chapter focused on the\nemergent real that comes into being thanks to the particular ways these two\nkinds of generals—the living one beyond the human and the one that is\ndistinctively human—come to be held together in the forest’s ecology of\nselves.\n\nThis emergent real that comes into being in the forests around Ávila is the\nspirit realm of the masters. It is the product of a special configuration of\nconcept and kind. It is a real that lies beyond the forest in ways that also\ncatch up the life of the forest at the same time that it entangles that life\nwith the all-too-human histories of the many dead that continue to haunt this\nforest that houses the masters.\n\nThroughout this book I have sought ways to account for difference and novelty\ndespite continuity. Emergence is a technical term I used to trace linkages\nacross disjuncture; beyond is a broader, more general, one. That beyond human\nlanguage lies semiosis reminds us that language is connected to the semiosis\nof the living world, which extends beyond it. That there are selves beyond the\nhuman draws attention to the fact that some of the attributes of our human\nselfhood are continuous with theirs. That there is a death beyond every life\ngestures toward the ways we might continue, thanks to the spaces opened up by\nall the absent dead who make us what we are. That form extends beyond life\ndraws our attention to the effortless propagation of pattern that runs through\nour lives. And, finally, that spirits are a real part of an afterlife that\nextends beyond life tells us something about the continuity and generality\nintrinsic to life itself.\n\nI hope to have provided here, in traversing this selva selvaggia, this wild\n“dense” and “difficult” forest where words so often fail us, some intimation\nof how it is that forests think. This thinking is amplified in a dense ecology\nof selves and certain historically contingent Runa ways of attending to that\necology.\n\nRuna ways of attending to this forest ecology of selves are (in part) the\nproduct of an all-too-human marginalization from the national economy that\nmight otherwise more equitably link rural communities like Ávila to some of\nEcuador’s growing wealth. Greater integration into national networks will\ncertainly offer much more secure forms of sustenance, ones that would make the\nmore onerous and riskier search for food in the forest obsolete and largely\nirrelevant. And things are moving in this direction. Quito is—through the\nnationwide expansion of roads, advances in health care, education,\ninfrastructure, and so on—finally, after all these centuries, coming to the\nforest.\n\nIn pointing out the relation between socioeconomic and political\nmarginalization and the forest-oriented subsistence that the Ávila Runa\npractice, I do not wish to reduce culture to poverty (as some would).\nFurthermore, I’m not, as should by now be clear, talking about culture. What\nis more, there is a certain plentitude to daily life in Ávila, one that is\ncherished by those who live in Ávila. And this richness exists regardless of\nthe economic or health metrics one might use to evaluate it.\n\nThe particular colonially inflected, multispecies ecology of selves that I\nhave described here is real in an ethnographic and ontological sense. But it\ndepends for its existence on the continuous flourishing of dense nonhuman\necologies just as it does on the humans who live by tapping into those\necologies. If too many of these elements that make up this ecology of selves\ndisappear, a particular kind of life (and afterlife) will come to an\nend—forever. And we will have to find ways to mourn its absence.\n\nBut it is not as if all life will end. There will be other Runa ways of being\nhuman—ones that might well also entangle nonhumans, ones that might call forth\nother spirits. And we must find ways to listen for the hopes that that kind of\nreality houses as well.\n\nIn turning my ethnographic attention to something potentially ephemeral and\nfleeting—the reality of a particularly dense ecology of selves, one that is\nboth all too human and lies well beyond the human—I am not doing salvage\nanthropology. For what I am charting does not just disappear; ethnographic\nattention to this particular set of relations amplifies and thus allows us to\nappreciate ways of attending to the living logics that are already part of how\nforests think themselves through “us.” And if “we” are to survive the\nAnthropocene—this indeterminate epoch of ours in which the world beyond the\nhuman is being increasingly made over by the all-too-human—we will have to\nactively cultivate these ways of thinking with and like forests.\n\nI want, in this regard, to return to my title, How Forests Think. I chose this\ntitle because of its resonance, as I’ve noted, with Lévy-Bruhls’s How Natives\nThink, a classic treatment of animistic thinking. At the same time, I wish to\ndraw an important distinction: forests think; and when “natives” (or others,\nfor that matter) think about that, they are made over by the thoughts of a\nthinking forest. My title How Forests Think also resonates with La Pensée\nsauvage, Lévi-Strauss’s meditation on wild thought. Lévi-Strauss’s meditation\nis about a kind of thought that both is and is not domesticated by the human.\nIn this way it is like the ornamental flower the pansy—that other meaning of\npensée—to which his title playfully alludes. Despite the fact that the pansy\nis domesticated, and therefore “tame,” it is also alive. And thus, like us,\nand like the Runa—those “indios mansos”—the pansy is also wild. Sauvage, of\ncourse, is etymologically related to sylvan—that which is of the (wild)\nforest, the “selva selvaggia.”\n\nMy own ethnographic meditation has been an attempt to liberate our thinking.\nIt has been an attempt to step out, for a moment, of our doubt-ridden human\nhousing to open ourselves to those wild living thoughts beyond the human—those\nthat also make “us.” To do this, we need to leave our guide the runa puma—our\nVirgil—and we also need to leave that forest, the selva selvaggia around\nÁvila. We do so, not necessarily to ascend to Dante’s heavenly spheres (this\nis not that kind of morality tale; I’m not talking about that kind of telos).\nWe leave this forest to step, for a moment, on our own, into a generality: one\nthat is ethereal, perhaps, and one that lies beyond this particular\nethnographic encounter.\n\nIn finding ways to open our thinking to living thoughts, to selves and souls,\nto the forest’s many spirits, and even to the Lion as concept and kind, I have\nbeen trying to say something concrete about something general. I have been\ntrying to say something about a general that makes itself felt in us “here” at\nthe same time that it extends beyond us, over “there.” Opening our thinking in\nthis way might allow us to realize a greater Us—an Us that can flourish not\njust in our lives, but in the lives of those who will live beyond us. That\nwould be our gift, however modest, to the living future.\n\n\n* * *\n\nNOTES\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn1) For my treatment of Quichua I adopt a\npractical orthography based on Spanish from Orr and Wrisley (1981: 154). In\naddition I use an apostrophe (“’”) to indicate stops and a superscript h (“h”)\nto indicate aspiration. Words are to be stressed on the penultimate syllable\nunless indicated by an accent. The plural marker in Quichua is -guna. However,\nfor reasons of clarity, I usually do not include the plural marker in my\ndiscussion of individual Quichua words even in contexts in which I use the\nterm in its plural form in English. A hyphen (“-”) indicates that word parts\nare suppressed. I use an en-dash (“–”) to indicate where the vowels of a word\nhave been drawn out. I use an em-dash (“—”) to indicate an even greater\nelongation.\n\n[2.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn2) For ethnographic monographs on the\nQuichua-speaking Runa of Ecuador’s Upper Amazon, see Whitten (1976), Macdonald\n(1979), and Uzendoski (2005). Muratorio (1987) and Oberem (1980) situate Runa\nlifeways within colonial and republican history and a broader political\neconomy. For Ávila, see Kohn (2002b).\n\n[3.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn3) Aya huasca is prepared from a vine of the\nsame name (Banisteriopsis caapi, Malpighiaceae) and sometimes mixed with other\ningredients.\n\n[4.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn4) Norman Whitten’s classic monograph, Sacha\nRuna (1976), astutely captures this tension between sylvan and civilized\ninherent to Runa ways of being.\n\n[5.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn5) All translations from Spanish and Quichua\nare my own.\n\n[6.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn6) In an earlier work (Kohn 2007) I referred\nto my approach as an “anthropology of life.” The current iteration is closely\nrelated to that approach except that here I am less interested in the\nanthropological treatment of a subject matter (an anthropology of x) and more\nin an analytic that can take us beyond our subject matter (“the human”)\nwithout abandoning it. Although so much of what we can learn about the human\ninvolves thinking with the logics of life that extend beyond the human, taking\nanthropology beyond the human also requires, as I will show, looking beyond\nlife.\n\n[7.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn7) I do not deny the fact that certain\n“multinatural” forms of being in and understanding the world, including, most\nconspicuously, Amazonian ones, can shed critical light on what, by contrast,\nwe can come to see as our folk academic “multicultural” conventions (Viveiros\nde Castro 1998). Nevertheless, the multiplication of natures is not an\nantidote to the problem posed by the multiplication of cultures.\n\n[8.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn8) A caffeine-rich beverage made from Ilex\nguayusa (Aquifoliaceae), a plant that is closely related to that used to make\nArgentinian mate.\n\n[9.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn9) I collected over 1,100 specimens of plants\nas well as 24 specimens of fungi. These are housed in the Herbario Nacional,\nQuito, with duplicates in the Missouri Botanical Garden. I also collected over\n400 specimens of invertebrates, over 90 specimens of herpetofauna, and almost\n60 specimens of mammals (all housed in the zoological museum of the\nUniversidad Católica, Quito). My 31 specimens of fish are housed in the\nzoological museum of the Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Quito. Making specimens\nof birds is very difficult, requiring the complex preparation of skins.\nTherefore, I decided instead to document local avian faunal knowledge by\ntaking close-up photographs of hunted specimens and conducting interviews\nusing illustrated field manuals and recordings of calls.\n\n[10.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn10) By “relata,” I mean a term, object, or\nentity that is constituted by its relationships to other such terms, objects,\nor entities, in the relational system in which it exists.\n\n[11.](Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn11) This form of citation, referring to the\nvolume and paragraphs in Peirce’s Collected Papers (1931), is the standard one\nused by Peirce scholars.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n[1.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn1) I largely follow here the anthropological\nlinguist Janis Nuckolls (1996) in her linguistic conventions for parsing\nQuichua. “Live” is an English gloss of the lexeme causa-; “2” indicates that\nit is conjugated for the second-person singular; “INTER” indicates that -chu\nis an interrogative, or question-marking suffix (see Cole 1985: 14–16).\n\n[2.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn2) In structuring my argument by asking you, the\nreader, to feel tsupu, I ask you to bracket, for a moment, your skepticism.\nBut the argument still holds even if you don’t “feel tsupu.” As I will be\ndiscussing, tsupu exhibits formal properties (shared with similar sound images\nin all languages) that support the argument at hand (see also Sapir 1951\n[1929]; Nuckolls 1999; Kilian-Hatz 2001).\n\n[3.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn3) I adopt “becoming worldly” from Donna Haraway\n(see Haraway 2008: 3, 35, 41) to invoke the possibility of inhabiting\nunprecedented and more hopeful emergent worlds through a practice of attention\nto those beings—human and nonhuman—that, in so many different ways, stand\nbeyond us. Human language is both an impediment to and a vehicle for the\nrealization of this project. This chapter attempts to explore how this is so.\n\n[4.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn4) From Marshall Sahlins’s (1976: 12) classic\nanthropological statement on the relationship between culture and symbolic\nmeaning to biology: “In the symbolic event, a radical discontinuity is\nintroduced between culture and nature.” This echoes Saussure’s (1959: 113)\ninsistence on the “radically arbitrary” bond between “sound” (cf. nature) and\n“idea” (cf. culture).\n\n[5.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn5) This canopy emergent tree bearing big peapod-\nlike fruits is known as puca pacai in Ávila (Latin Inga alba, Fabaceae-\nMimosoideae).\n\n[6.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn6) See Kohn (2002b: 148–49) for the Quichua text.\n\n[7.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn7) For the purposes of this book I am collapsing a\nmore complex division of the semiotic process, which, according to Peircean\nsemiotics, involves three aspects: (1) a sign can be understood in terms of\nthe characteristics it possesses in and of itself (whether it is a quality, an\nactual existent, or a law); (2) it can be understood in terms of the kind of\nrelation it has to the object it represents; and (3) it can be understood in\nterms of the way its “interpretant” (a subsequent sign) represents it and its\nrelation to its object. By using the term sign vehicle I am focusing here on\nthe first of these three divisions. In general, however, as I will explain in\nthe text, I am only treating signs as icons, indices, or symbols. In the\nprocess I am consciously collapsing the triadic division outlined above.\nWhether a sign is an icon, index, or symbol refers technically only to the\nsecond of the three divisions of the sign process (see Peirce CP 2.243–52).\n\n[8.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn8) Cf. Peirce’s discussion of how suppression of\ncertain features draws the attention to other ones in what he terms\n“diagrammatic icons” (Peirce 1998b: 13).\n\n[9.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn9) Of course the icon pu oh can also serve as an\nindex (to be defined later in the text) at another level of interpretation.\nLike the event it is like, it can also startle someone who hears it.\n\n[10.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn10) See Peirce (1998d: 8).\n\n[11.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn11) See Peirce (CP 1.346, 1.339).\n\n[12.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn12) See Peirce (CP 1.339).\n\n[13.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn13) In this regard, note how in Peirce’s\npragmatism, “means” and “meaning” are related (CP 1.343).\n\n[14.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn14) See Peirce (CP 1.213).\n\n[15.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn15) Note that by recognizing how all signs,\nlinguistic and otherwise, always “do things” we no longer need to appeal to a\nperformative theory to make up for the deficiencies of a view of language as\nreference bereft of action (see Austin 1962).\n\n[16.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn16) See my discussion in the introduction on how\neven those anthropological approaches that recognize signs other than symbols\nstill see these as exclusively human and interpretively framed by symbolic\ncontexts.\n\n[17.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn17) Latin Solanum quitoense.\n\n[18.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn18) See Kohn (1992).\n\n[19.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn19) This example is adapted from Deacon’s (1997:\n75–76) discussion of iconism and the evolution of cryptic moth coloration.\n\n[20.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn20) The argument I make here about the logical\nrelation of indexicality to iconicity follows and is adapted from Deacon\n(1997: 77–78).\n\n[21.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn21) Deacon is describing and semiotically\nreinterpreting the research of Sue Savage-Rumbaugh (see Savage-Rumbaugh 1986).\n\n[22.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn22) See also Peirce (CP 2.302) and Peirce (1998d:\n10).\n\n[23.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn23) By “inferential,” I mean that lineages of\norganisms constitute “guesses” about the environment. Via an evolutionary\nselective dynamic organisms come increasingly to “fit” their environment (see\nchapter 2).\n\n[24.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn24) This tends to be collapsed in anthropological\ntreatments of Peirce. That is, thirdness tends to be seen only as a human\nsymbolic attribute (see, e.g., Keane 2003: 414, 415, 420) rather than a\nproperty inherent to all semiosis and, in fact, to all regularity in the\nworld.\n\n[25.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn25) “[The categories of firstness, secondness,\nand thirdness] suggest a way of thinking; and the possibility of science\ndepends upon the fact that human thought necessarily partakes of whatever\ncharacter is diffused through the whole universe, and that its natural modes\nhave some tendency to be the modes of action of the universe” (Peirce CP\n1.351).\n\n[26.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn26) And yet we must also recognize Descartes’s\ninsights about the “firstness” of feeling and of self. “I think therefore I\nam” loses its sense (and feeling) when it is applied to the plural or to the\nsecond or third person—just as only you—as an I—can feel tsupu.\n\n[27.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn27) See Kohn (2002b: 150–51) for Quichua text.\n\n[28.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn28) See Kohn (2002b: 45–46) for Quichua text.\n\n[29.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn29) Quichua pishcu anga.\n\n[30.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn30) See Kohn (2002b: 76) for Quichua text.\n\n[31.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn31) As such, it is related to ticu, which is used\nin Ávila to describe clumsy ambulation (see Kohn 2002b: 76).\n\n[32.](chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn32) See Bergson (1911: 97).

Accordingly, he refers to this way of thinking as\n“multinaturalism” and uses it as a critique of the multicultural logic (i.e.,\nmany cultures, one nature) typical of contemporary Western folk academic\nthought, especially in the guise of cultural relativism (cf.

Unlike animals they are expected to eat cooked food.\n\n  2. According to some, they have souls that are capable of ascending to the Christian heaven.\n\n  3. They acquire the dispositions of their masters; mean owners have mean dogs.\n\n  4. Dogs and children who become lost in the forest become “wild” (Quichua quita) and therefore frightened of people.\n\n[8.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn8) See Oberem (1980: 66); see also Schwartz (1997:\n162–63); Ariel de Vidas (2002: 538).\n\n[9.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn9) In fact mythic man-eating jaguars are said to\nrefer to humans as palm hearts.\n\n[10.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn10) See Fausto (2007); Conklin (2001).\n\n[11.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn11) These are known in Ávila as “forest masters”\n(sacha amuguna) or “forest lords” (sacha curagaguna).\n\n[12.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn12) Colonial categories used historically to\ndescribe the Runa, such as Christian and manso (tame; Quichua mansu), as\nopposed to infidel (auca) and wild (quita), however problematic (see Uzendoski\n2005: 165), cannot be discounted because, in Ávila at least, they currently\nconstitute the idiom through which a certain kind of agency, albeit one that\nis not so overtly visible, is manifested (see chapter 6).\n\n[13.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn13) I thank Manuela Carneiro da Cunha for\nreminding me of this fact, to which several Ávila oral histories that I have\ncollected attest. See also Blomberg (1957) for eyewitness written accounts and\nphotographs of such expeditions.\n\n[14.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn14) The term runa is also used in Ecuadorian\nSpanish to describe cattle that are not an identifiable breed. It is also used\nto describe anything that is considered pejoratively as having supposedly\n“Indian” qualities (e.g., items considered shabby or dirty).\n\n[15.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn15) See also Haraway (2003: 41, 45).\n\n[16.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn16) Descola, regarding the Achuar, refers to this\nform of isolation as the “solipsism of natural idioms” (1989: 443). The\nemphasis he gives to the failure in communication thus implied is appropriate\ngiven this chapter’s subject matter.\n\n[17.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn17) Willerslev’s (2007) discussion of Siberian\nYukaghir hunting treats in great detail this threat to human identity posed by\nrelations with animals. The solutions the Yukaghir find are different; the\ngeneral problem—the challenge of living socially in a world peopled by many\nkinds of selves—is the same.\n\n[18.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn18) Quichua duiñu, from the Spanish dueño.\n\n[19.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn19) For examples of this canine lexicon, see Kohn\n(2007: 21 n. 30).\n\n[20.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn20) As in chapter 1 I follow in this chapter\nNuckolls (1996) in her linguistic conventions for parsing Quichua. These\ninclude the following: ACC = Accusative case; COR = Coreference; FUT = Future;\nNEG IMP = Negative Imperative; SUB = Subjunctive; 2 = Second person; 3 = Third\nperson.\n\n[21.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn21) Ucucha refers to the class of small rodents\nthat includes mice, rats, spiny rats, and mouse opossums. It is a euphemism\nfor sicu, the class of large edible rodents that includes the agouti, paca,\nand agouchy.\n\n[22.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn22) Here is another example from Ávila, not\ndiscussed in the body of this chapter, of giving advice to dogs using canine\nimperatives while administering tsita:\n\n> 2.1 tiutiu-nga ni-sa\n>\n> chase-3FUT say-COR\n>\n> thinking/desiring it will chase\n>\n> 2.2 ama runa-ta capari-nga ni-sa\n>\n> NEG IMP person-ACC bark-3-FUT say-COR\n>\n> thinking/desiring it will not bark at people\n\n[23.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn23) I thank Bill Hanks for suggesting this term.\n\n[24.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn24) Regarding the anomalous use of a negative\nimperative in combination with a third-person future marker in line 1.2 (cf.\nlines 1.5 and 5.3 in the text and 2.2 in note 22), the following are related\nconstructions that would be considered grammatically correct in everyday Ávila\nQuichua:\n\nIf addressed to a dog in the second person:\n\n> 3 atalpa-ta ama cani-y-chu\n>\n> chicken-ACC NEG IMP bite-2-IMP-NEG\n>\n> don’t bite chickens\n\nIf addressed to another person about a dog:\n\n> 4a atalpa-ta mana cani-nga-chu\n>\n> chicken-ACC NEG bite-3FUT-NEG\n>\n> it will not bite chickens\n\nor\n\n> 4b atalpa-ta ama cani-chun\n>\n> chicken-ACC NEG bite-SUB\n>\n> so that it doesn’t bite chickens\n\n[25.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn25) Regarding how humans can bring out human\nsubjectivities in animals by denying them their bodies, compare reports and\nlegends of Runa men undressing themselves before fighting off jaguars they\nencounter in the forest. By doing so, they remind jaguars that beneath their\nfeline bodily habitus, which can be “divested” like clothing, they too are\nhumans (see chapter 6).\n\n[26.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn26) According to Janis Nuckolls, Quichua speakers\nfrom the Pastaza region of Amazonian Ecuador refer to or address these spirits\nin songs using third-person future constructions (pers. com.). This is another\nreason for suspecting that the use of “señora” to address spirit lovers in\nÁvila is related to the use of “canine imperatives.”\n\n[27.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn27) Reduplication is frequently used in imitating\nbirdcalls and in onomatopoeic bird names in Ávila (see also Berlin and O’Neill\n1981; Berlin 1992).\n\n[28.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn28) See also Taylor (1996); Viveiros de Castro\n(1998).\n\n[29.](chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn29) On distributed selfhood, see Peirce (CP\n3.613; 5.421; 7.572).

In Ávila, the tapir,\ndistant relative of the horse and the New World’s only extant native odd-toed\nungulate, is understood to be the horse of certain spirit masters of the\nforest.\n\n2) The correspondence between white domestication and Indian forest predation\nas noted by the seventeenth-century Jesuit priest Figueroa who marveled at the\nnuts and fruits that “nature, like an orchard, provides” Amazonians and\nreferred to the “herds of wild pigs” and other animals of the forest as\nAmazonian “livestock” (“crías”) “that need no care” (Figueroa 1986 [1661]:\n263).\n\n3) The nineteenth-century Jesuit priest Pozzi who in a sermon in Loreto\ncompared Runa hunting to civilized animal husbandry (in Jouanen 1977: 90).\n\n[3.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn3) See Janzen (1970); Wills et al. (1997).\n\n[4.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn4) My argument about the ways in which the rubber\neconomy was formally constrained is at odds with, but ultimately not\ninconsistent with, what Steven Bunker has written. Bunker (1985: 68–69) argued\nthat the fungal parasite is not enough to make rubber cropping in the Amazon\nimpossible. Successful grafting and close planting techniques were developed\nin the Amazon, but these are labor-intensive, and what was lacking in this\nregion was labor. Labor shortages, not parasites, according to Bunker, were\nwhat prevented plantation cropping. Surely, the form-propagating tendencies\nthat the rubber boom reveals are weak ones, and with sufficient labor they\nmight well become dampened or even irrelevant. But the shortage of labor at\nthis time allowed for certain formal properties to become amplified and to\npropagate across a variety of domains, and to thus play a central role in the\nrubber economy.\n\n[5.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn5) Salminus hilarii.\n\n[6.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn6) Virola duckei, Myristicaceae.\n\n[7.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn7) For a description of rubber tapping and initial\nprocessing and the skill and effort required to get latex to rivers, see\nCordova (1995).\n\n[8.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn8) See Irvine (1987) on the San José Runa\npreference for erecting hunting blinds by fruiting trees as opposed to\nsearching for game in the forest.

Extraction of these, even under the most\nruthless capitalist systems, requires entering into and, to an extent,\nsuccumbing to the relational logic that supports this living wealth.

Peirce refers to this as our\nexperience of secondness, which includes our experience of change, difference,\nresistance, otherness, and time (CP 1.336; 1.419); see chapter 1. This is not\nto deny that there are specific and highly variable sociohistorically situated\nmodalities of representing the past (see Turner 1988) or ideas about causality\n(Keane 2003). I am making a broader and more general set of claims, namely:\n(1) the experience of secondness is not necessarily delimited culturally; and\n(2) there are moments when the dyadic effects of the past on the present that\nwe associate with history becomes less relevant as a causal modality.\n\n[20.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn20) By “time,” I mean the directional process\nspanning from past to present to probable future. I am making no absolute\nclaim about the ontological status of time. Neither, however, do I want to say\nthat time is wholly a cultural or even a human construct (cf. CP 8.318). My\nargument is at the level of what Bateson calls “creatura” (2000a: 462). That\nis, in the realm of life, the past, present, and probable each comes to have\nspecific properties, and these properties are intimately involved in the ways\nin which semiotic selves represent the world around them. For it is in the\nrealm of life, via semiosis, that the future comes to affect the present\nthrough the vehicle of representation (see Peirce CP 1.325). See also chapter\n6.\n\n[21.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn21) Both glossed in Quichua as turmintu (from the\nSpanish tormento).\n\n[22.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn22) In the spirit master’s realm, they escape\nJudgment Day, juiciu punja.\n\n[23.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn23) See Peirce (CP 6.101).\n\n[24.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn24) Jonathan Hill (1988) and several other\ncontributors to his edited volume provide a critique of Lévi-Strauss’s\nhot/cold distinction. Hill argues that this distinction erases the many ways\nin which Amazonians are products of, producers of, and conscious of history.\nPeter Gow (2001) has argued that such a critique misses Lévi-Strauss’s point:\nmyths are responses to history in that they are, as Gow puts it, “instruments\nfor the obliteration of time” (27). That myths have this characteristic is\nevident. What is less clear from Gow’s analysis is why. My argument is that\ntimelessness is an effect of the peculiar properties of form.\n\n[25.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn25) Cf. Lévi-Strauss: “odds and ends left over\nfrom psychological or historical processes, . . . [which] appear as such only\nin relation to the history which produced them and not from the point of view\nof the logic for which they are used” (1966: 35).\n\n[26.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn26) For the position that Amazonian landscape and\nnatural history are always in some ways social, see Raffles (2002). On the\n“pristine myth” and for a review of the literature on anthropogenic forests,\nsee Denevan (1992); Cleary (2001). Without denying the importance of\nhistoricizing “natural history,” the position I take is somewhat different.\nThe idea that all nature is always already historical is related to the\nrepresentational problem we face in our field—namely, that we don’t know how\nto talk about that which stands outside the human-specific conventional logic\nof symbolic reference without reducing the human to matter (see chapter 1).\n\n[27.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn27) On the hopes for symmetrical relations\nbetween Upper Amazonians and Europeans, see Taylor (1999: 218).\n\n[28.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn28) See Kohn (2002b: 363–64) for a more detailed\naccount.\n\n[29.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn29) People in Ávila today recount a myth that\nexplains why a certain king, sometimes referred to as an Inca, abandoned his\nattempts to build Quito near Ávila and finally built it in the Andes. Some\npeople even discern the remnants of this failed jungle Quito in the landscape.\nThis idea of a Quito having quite literally abandoned the region also comes up\nin the nearby community Oyacachi (see Kohn 2000b: 249–50; Kohn 2002a).\n\n[30.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn30) There are also all-too-human contexts in\nwhich form propagates. Late Soviet socialism provides one such example (see\nYurchak 2006, 2008; and my comment on the latter [Kohn 2008]). Here, the\nsevering of official discursive form from any indexical specification—a form\nthat was nevertheless sustained by the entire might of the Soviet\nstate—allowed a certain kind of invisible self-organizing politics to emerge\nspontaneously and simultaneously throughout various parts of the Soviet Union.\nYurchak appropriately calls this a “politics of indistinction,” alluding to\nthe way it harnessed and proliferated official discursive forms (for some sort\nof an end, however undefined) rather than acquiescing to or resisting them.\n\n[31.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn31) See Peirce (1998d: 4); cf. Bateson (2000d:\n135).\n\n[32.](chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn32) Quoted in Colapietro (1989: 38). I thank\nFrank Salomon for first drawing my attention to this passage.\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n[1.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn1) Quichua sahinu chuspi (peccary flies); Latin\nDiptera.\n\n[2.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn2) By drawing on Freud’s understanding of the\nuncanny, as “that species of the frightening that goes back to what was once\nwell known and had long been familiar” (Freud 2003: 124), I wish to make\nexplicit reference to Mary Weismantel’s (2001) treatment of the pishtaco, the\nwhite bogeyman of the Andes that eats Indian fat. The pishtaco, like the\npoliceman for Oswaldo, is inextricably embedded in what it is to be Andean in\nways that are uncanny—frightening but also intimate and familiar.\n\n[3.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn3) And yet such a generalized power could not\nexist without the specific instances of its manifestation. Structures of\ndomination are ultimately given their “brutal” efficacy through what Peirce\nhas called “secondness” (see chapter 1), manifest, according to one example he\ngives, in “the sheriff’s hand” on your shoulder (CP 1.24) or, in Oswaldo’s\ncase, in the policeman who suddenly appears at a friend’s door (see CP 1.213).\nAnd yet, as Butler underscores, power is something more than such easily\nexternalized brutality.\n\n[4.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn4) We live in a sort of gift economy with the\ndead, with the spirits, and with the future selves we might come to be and\nwithout whom we are nothing. Marcel Mauss’s notion of the debts that make us\nwho we are applies to our relations to all of these others: “by giving one is\ngiving oneself, and if one gives oneself, it is because one ‘owes’\noneself—one’s person and one’s goods—to others” (Mauss 1990 [1950]: 46).\n\n[5.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn5) Wooden slit drums used for long-distance\ncommunication were among the first things that the Spaniards banned in the\nUpper Amazon (Oberem 1980).\n\n[6.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn6) This is not to say that they would consider\nthemselves unclothed. Penis strings and face paints function in important ways\nas clothing.\n\n[7.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn7) “hacerlos de brutos, hombres, y de hombres,\ncristianos.”\n\n[8.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn8) This form of always already inhabiting\nsomething that might otherwise be understood as the cumulative effect of\nhistory makes itself manifest in Oyacachi, a cloud forest village to the west\nof Ávila that in the early colonial period was part of the same Quijos\nchiefdom. As people there understand it there was never a time when they were\nnot Christian. In fact, according to one myth (see Kohn 2002a), it is the\nwhite European priests, not the natives, who are the pagans in need of\nconversion.\n\n[9.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn9) Sometimes, of course, self-objectification is\nan important strategy for achieving political visibility.\n\n[10.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn10) Refillable metal shotgun cartridges have a\nlittle hole at the base where one fits the firing cap. Oswaldo’s dream image,\nI should note, has shamanistic overtones. Blowing through a shotgun cartridge\nis like blowing through a blowgun, and sorcerers attack their victims by\nplacing their cupped hands to their mouths and shooting invisible blowgun\ndarts (sagra tullu) at their victims.\n\n[11.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn11) By “topic” here, I mean the theme of a\nsentence, that about which the sentence gives information, as opposed to its\ngrammatical subject, which may or may not also be the topic. Quichua speakers\noften mark the topic (which may be either the subject, object, adverb, or verb\nof the sentence) for a number of reasons, including, as is done in the example\ntreated here, to emphasize a theme that might not otherwise be noted given the\nassumed context. For a discussion of topic, on which my treatment of the\nmatter is based, and for a further explanation of the use of topic-marking\nsuffixes in Ecuadorian Quichua, see Chuquín and Salomon (1992: 70–73) and Cole\n(1985: 95–96).\n\n[12.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn12) For the Quichua text, see Kohn (2002b: 292).\n\n[13.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn13) In an otherwise identical series of myths\nthese apostles replace the well-known culture hero brothers Cuillur and Duciru\nof other Upper Amazonian Runa communities (e.g., Orr and Hudelson 1971).\n\n[14.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn14) Urban writes about this in terms of the\ncontinuity of “culture,” not of self.\n\n[15.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn15) “In the flow of time in the mind, the past\nappears to act directly upon the future, its effect being called memory, while\nthe future only acts upon the past through the medium of thirds” (CP 1.325).\n\n[16.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn16) This is in reference to the Tupian Omagua.\n\n[17.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn17) See Gianotti (1997: 128); Oberem (1980: 290);\nWavrin (1927: 335).\n\n[18.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn18) See Wavrin (1927: 335); see also Gianotti\n(1997: 128); Avendaño (1985 [1861]: 152); Orton (1876: 193); Colini (1883:\n296); cf. Maroni (1988 [1738]: 172, 378); Kohn (2002b: 238).\n\n[19.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn19) “Chuchuyu,” “with breasts,” was how Ventura\nreferred to Rosa’s granddaughters, before explaining that in the master’s\nrealm, Rosa would “live forever, never to die again, without suffering, like a\nchild” (“Huiñai huiñai causangapa, mana mas huañungapa, mana tormento,\nhuahuacuintallata”).\n\n[20.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn20) This probably refers to the barred antshrike.\n\n[21.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn21) Quichua: runa pamba (lit., “people burier”);\nEnglish: tarantula hawk; Latin: Pepsis sp., Pompilidae.\n\n[22.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn22) For more such examples, see Kohn (2002b:\n242–43, 462 n. 54).\n\n[23.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn23) Ginsberg’s “kaddish” does mention death.\n\n[24.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn24) For a discussion of names for shamans and\nshamanism, see Kohn (2002b: 336–38).\n\n[25.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn25) Regarding the abandonment of shorts for long\npants among the Tena Runa, see Gianotti (1997: 253).\n\n[26.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn26) Wavrin similarly reports that men who\nencounter jaguars are not afraid of them and can do battle with them,\n“fighting one-on-one as equals” as if they were men because they know these\njaguars were once men (Wavrin 1927: 335; see also Kohn 2002b: 270).\n\n[27.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn27) Cushma refers to a gown traditionally worn by\nCofán as well as western Tukanoan Siona and Secoya men.\n\n[28.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn28) See Kohn (2002b: 271–72) for an early\ncolonial Ávila area example of the use of clothing to confer power.\n\n[29.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn29) “Pucuhuai, camba yachaita japingapa.”\n\n[30.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn30) See Kohn (2002b: 281) for eighteenth-century\nAmazonian strategies of appropriating white clothing as equipment.\n\n[31.](chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn31) My thinking about survival has been greatly\ninfluenced by Lisa Stevenson’s work.\n\n\n* * *\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAgamben, Giorgio\n\n2004The Open: Man and Animal.

I owe a great deal to my colleagues from the _Marx-\nEngels-Gesamtausgabe_ , in particular Gerald Hubmann, Timm Graßmann, Regina\nRoth, Claudia Reichel, Jürgen Herres, Rolf Hecker and Carl-Erich Vollgraf in\nBerlin, Germany.\n\nI also benefited from the JSPS Overseas Research Fellowship (2016–17), which\nenabled me to stay at the Department of Sociology at the University of\nCalifornia–Santa Barbara to conduct research with Kevin Anderson. His _Marx\nat_ _the Margins_ gave me indispensable inspiration for starting this book\nproject. Ryuji Sasaki and Soichiro Sumida from Japan read and commented upon\nthe entire manuscript. This time, again, they helped improve the logical\nconsistency and clarity of the text. In addition, I have frequently discussed\nthis project with my close colleagues Tomonaga Tairako, Makoto Itoh, Hideto\nAkashi, Kengo Nakamura and Midori Wakamori, who always provided me with\nimmense encouragement and important suggestions. Patrick Eiden-Offe, Judith\nDellheim and Terrell Carver also read and gave me invaluable comments on parts\nof the manuscript. Others offered comments in response to talks and papers\npresented at various conferences and lectures, especially Michael Heinrich,\nFrieder Otto Wolf, Christian Zeller, Bob Jessop, Babak Amini, Bini Adamczak,\nKaan Kangal, Paula Rauhala, Joel Wainwright, Martin Wagner, Yibing Zhang, Ingo\nStützle, Michael Löwy, Nick Srnicek, Michael Hardt, Paul Mason, Paul Burkett\nand John Bellamy Foster.\n\nDuring the research, I had precious opportunities to attend various\ninternational conferences and seminars. Earlier versions of parts of this book\nhave Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nx _| Acknowledgements_\n\nbeen presented at meetings of the Historical Materialism Conference (London),\nthe Japan Society of Political Economy (Tokyo) and Marx-Collegium (Toronto).\n\nMy deepest gratitude goes to Marcello Musto, who is a close collaborator on my\nimportant projects. I attended several key international conferences that he\norganized at York University (2017), ADRI in Patna, India (2018), and the\nUniversity of Pisa (2019). Through these conferences, I had the opportunity to\nshare my thoughts with other scholars and develop my ideas significantly. The\npublication of this book is an outcome of the support received from the Social\nScience and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), Partnership\nDevelopment Grant (890-2020-0091), ‘The Global History of Karl Marx’s\n_Capital’_ , which is also a collaborative project with Marcello Musto.\n\nVishwas Satgar and Michelle Williams at Witts University kindly invited me to\nJohannesburg for a week to give three lectures there in the summer of 2018.\nLeslie Esther and Alex Colas organized my visit to London to receive the\nDeutsche Memorial Prize awarded to my previous book _Karl Marx’s Ecosocialism_\n(Monthly Review Press, 2017) and give other lectures and presentations in\nNovember 2018. I also want to thank Markus Gabriel and Sebastian Breu for\norganizing an international conference at the University of Bonn in June 2019,\nin which I presented the chapter on Georg Lukács. Sighard Neckel also invited\nme to an annual conference, ‘Unsustainable Past – Sustainable Future? _’_ , at\nthe University of Hamburg, which gave me an invaluable chance to discuss the\nrelationship between Marxian economics and degrowth in the age of ecological\ncrisis. In addition, the book is greatly indebted to Seongjing Jeong, who in\n2018\n\nkindly invited me to join a Korean research group for Social Science of Korea\nfor ‘Postcapitalism and the Innovation of Marxism’ funded by the Ministry of\nEducation of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of\nKorea (NRF-2021S1A3A2A02096299). International research with Korean scholars,\nincluding Sangwon Han, Seung-wook Baek, Hyun Kang Kim, Vladimir Tikhonov and\nMinzy Koh, helped widen the scope of the project. The research is also\nsupported by the Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS Kakenhi Grant\nNumber JP20K13466).\n\nSome of the main ideas were developed during the preparation of my previous\nbook _Hitoshinsei no Shihonron_ ( _Capital in the Anthropocene_) (Tokyo:\nShueisha, 2020), which turned out to be unexpectedly popular in Japan, selling\nhalf a million copies. I owe its great success to my editor Yuka Hattori, who\ndevoted an enormous amount of time and energy to the book. Part of the current\nbook can be regarded as a more rigorous and academic version of the Japanese\nbook, and its clarity comes from her editorial assistance. Obviously, the\ncurrent book is not a translation of the previous Japanese book. Rather, it\nbuilds on wholly new arguments with a more careful reading of materials and\nthe reconstruction of key debates on Marxian ecology in recent years. Anwesha\nRana from Cambridge Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n_Acknowledgements_ | xi\n\nUniversity Press patiently helped me in the preparation of the current book\ndespite a significant delay in manuscript delivery due to the global pandemic\nin 2020–2022.

We are experiencing ‘the end of the end of history’\n\n(Hochuli, Hoare and Cunliffe 2021). With the rapid deepening of the global\necological crisis in various forms such as climate change, oxidation of the\nocean, disruption of the nitrogen cycle, desertification, soil erosion and\nloss of biodiversity, Francis Fukuyama’s declaration of ‘the end of history’\n\nafter the collapse of the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) (Fukuyama\n1992) is approaching a totally unexpected dead end today, namely _the end of\nhuman history_. In fact, the triumph of neoliberal globalization only\naccelerated the rapid increase in environmental impacts upon the earth by\nhuman activities since the end of the Second World War – the so called ‘Great\nAcceleration’, the age in which all major socio-economic and Earth system\ntrends record a hockey stick pattern of increase (McNeil and Engelke 2016)\n\n– and ultimately destabilized the foundation of human civilization. Pandemic,\nwar and climate breakdown are all symptomatic of ‘the end of history’, putting\ndemocracy, capitalism and ecological systems into chronic crisis.\n\nMany people are well aware of the fact that the current mode of living is\nheading towards catastrophe, but the capitalist system does not offer an\nalternative to the juggernaut of overproduction and overconsumption. Nor is\nthere any compelling reason to believe that it will soon do so because\ncapitalism’s systemic compulsion continues to employ fossil fuel consumption\n_despite_ consistent warnings, knowledge and opposition. Considering the fact\nthat rapid, deep decarbonization that could meet the 1.5-degree-Celsius target\nof the Paris Agreement requires thorough transformative changes in virtually\nevery sphere of society, more radical social movements embracing direct action\nhave emerged, demanding to uproot the capitalist system\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n2 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ (Extinction Rebellion 2019). In this context,\nwhen Greta Thunberg denounced the ‘fairy tales of eternal growth’ in a speech,\nshe made it explicit that the capitalist system that aims for infinite\naccumulation on a finite planet is the root cause of climate breakdown.\n\nThis represents a new historical situation, especially to Marxism that has\nbeen treated like ‘a dead dog’ after the collapse of actually existing\nsocialism.\n\nAs environmentalists learn to unequivocally problematize the irrationality of\nthe current economic system, Marxism now has a chance of revival if it can\ncontribute to enriching debates and social movements by providing not only a\nthorough critique of the capitalist mode of production but also a concrete\nvision of post-capitalist society. However, this revival has not taken place\nso far, and persistent doubts remain about the usefulness of having recourse\nto the Marxian legacy in the 21st century. Marx’s political optimism most\nplainly expressed in _The Communist Manifesto_ has been repeatedly cited as\nevidence of his notorious and unacceptable productivism and ethnocentrism.\n\nIt is surely too naïve to believe that the further development of productive\nforces in Western capitalism could function as an emancipatory driver of\nhistory in the face of the global ecological crisis. In fact, the situation\ntoday differs decisively compared with that of 1848: capitalism is no longer\nprogressive. It rather destroys the general conditions of production and\nreproduction and even subjects human and non-human beings to serious\nexistential threat. In short, Marx’s view of historical progress appears\nhopelessly outdated. In this situation, if there is a slight hope of a revival\nof Marxism in this historical conjuncture, its essential precondition is the\nradical reformulation of its infamous grand scheme of ‘historical materialism’\nthat pivots around the contradiction between ‘productive forces’ and\n‘relations of production’. This constitutes the central topics of this book in\norder not to end (human) history but to envision another clear, bright future\nfrom a Marxian perspective without falling into pessimism and apocalypticism\nin the face of global ecological crisis.\n\nSuch a project cannot avoid the problem of ‘nature’. This is all the more so\nbecause the end of the ‘end of history’ brought about the end of the ‘end of\nnature’. Bill McKibben (1989) once warned that the idea of nature that the\nmodern world presupposed for a long time is gone for good because global\ncapitalism considerably modified the entire planet, leaving no pristine nature\nuntouched.1 This situation is now generally called _the_ _Anthropocene,_ in\nwhich humankind has become a ‘major geological force’\n\n(Crutzen and Stroermer 2000: 18) with massive scientific and technological\npower capable of transforming the entire planet on an unprecedented scale.2\n\nThe reality of the Anthropocene is, however, far from realizing the modern\ndream of human emancipation through the domination of nature.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Introduction_ | 3\n\nClimate change accompanied by sea-level rise, wildfires, heatwaves and change\nof precipitation patterns shows how the ‘end of nature’ dialectically turns\ninto the ‘return of nature’ (Foster 2020); the earth and its limits are more\nand more tangible in such a way that humans can no longer control nature’s\npower. It even subjugates them as an independent and alien force.\n\nIn other words, the modern Baconian project is collapsing. Confronted with\nthis increasing uncontrollability of nature, various critical theories of\nnature including eco-Marxism take up the urgent task of rethinking the\nrelationship between humanity and nature (Rosa, Henning and Bueno 2021).\nHowever, the dominant narrative of the Anthropocene is a _monist_ approach\ncharacterized by the hybridity of the social and the natural (Latour 2014;\nMoore 2015), which is _critical_ of Marxism. In contrast, the current project\naims to enrich the debate concerning the human–nature relationship by putting\nforward Marx’s _dualist_ methodology based on his theory of metabolism.\n\nThis theoretical task has important practical implications today. By\ncomprehending Marx’s method correctly, we can also recognize the unique\ncontribution his work offers to recent debates on post-capitalism. And here is\nthe third ‘end’ of post–Cold War values, that is, ‘the end of capitalist\nrealism’.\n\nMark Fisher (2009) once lamented that ‘capitalist realism’ – the sense that\n\n‘it is easier … to imagine the end of the world than of capitalism’ (Jameson\n2016: 3) – severely constrains our political imagination, subjugating us to\nthe regime of capital. The same tendency is discernible in environmentalism:\n‘It is easier to imagine a total catastrophe which ends all life on earth than\nit is to imagine a real change in capitalist relations’ (Žižek 2008: 334).\nHowever, as the multi-stranded crises of economy, democracy, care and the\nenvironment deepen, the tendency of which was strengthened even more by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian War, there are growing calls for\nradical ‘system change’. Both Slavoj Žižek (2020a) and Andreas Malm (2020)\nargue for ‘war communism’, while John Bellamy Foster (2020) and Michael Löwy\n(2015) defend the idea of ‘ecosocialism’.\n\nIn addition, there are intensive discussions on ‘life after capitalism’\n\n(Jackson 2021) even among non-Marxist scholars. Thomas Piketty’s (2021) dictum\nthat it is ‘time for socialism’ is exemplary here, but a more ecological\nversion of the same argument can be found in Naomi Klein’s explicit\nendorsement of the idea of ‘ecosocialism’:\n\nLet’s acknowledge this fact [that the Soviet Union and Venezuela are\nunecological], while also pointing out that countries with a strong democratic\nsocialist tradition – like Denmark, Sweden, and Uruguay –\n\nhave some of the most visionary environmental policies in the world.\n\nFrom this we can conclude that socialism isn’t necessarily ecological, but\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n4 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ that a new form of _democratic eco-socialism_ ,\nwith the humility to learn from Indigenous teachings about the duties to\nfuture generations and the interconnection of all of life, appears to be\nhumanity’s best shot at collective survival. (Klein 2019: 251; emphasis\nadded)3\n\nThis is a remarkable shift, considering the fact that Klein is not a Marxist.\n\nOnce Ellen Meiksins Wood (1995: 266) argued that ‘the issues of peace and\necology are not very well suited to generating strong anti-capitalist forces.\nIn a sense, the problem is their very universality. They do not constitute\nsocial forces because they simply have no specific social identity.’ Today’s\nsituation concerning ecology looks quite different from Wood’s time precisely\nbecause the planetary crisis provides a material basis for constituting a\nuniversal political subjectivity _against_ capital. This is because capital is\ncreating a globalized ‘environmental proletariat’ (Foster, York and Clark\n2010: 47) whose living conditions are severely undermined by capital\naccumulation.\n\nInspired by these recent attempts to foster imagination and creativity for a\nmore free, egalitarian and sustainable life, I draw upon Marx’s theory in\norder to put forward a wholly new Marxian vision of post-scarcity society\nadequate to the Anthropocene. Such a revival of Marx’s ecological vision of\npost-capitalism aims to enrich the discursive constellation around the\nAnthropocene, connecting this new geological concept to the contemporary\nissues of political economy, democracy and justice beyond the Earth sciences.\n\nThis new ecosocialist project for the Anthropocene is also supported by recent\nphilological findings, thanks to materials published for the first time in the\n_Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe_( _MEGA_). The _MEGA_ publishes in its fourth\nsection Marx’s notebooks on the natural sciences, and the scope of Marx’s\necological interests proves to be much more extensive than previously assumed\n(Saito 2017). Although these notebooks were neglected even by researchers for\nquite a long time, recent studies demonstrate that through his research in\ngeology, botany and agricultural chemistry, Marx intended to analyse various\npractices of robbery closely tied to climate change, the exhaustion of natural\nresources (soil nutrients, fossil fuel and woods) as well as the extinction of\nspecies due to the capitalist system of industrial production.\n\nConsequently, ecological aspects of Marx’s critique of political economy have\nbecome one of the central fields for revitalising the Marxian legacy in the\nAnthropocene. His concept of ‘metabolic rift’, in particular, has come to\nfunction as an indispensable conceptual tool for the ecological critique of\ncontemporary capitalism (Foster, York and Clark 2010; Foster and Burkett\n2016). This concept substantiates Marx’s critique of the destructive side of\ncapitalist production by demonstrating that it can be applied to contemporary\necological issues such as global warming, soil erosion, aquaculture, the\nlivestock business and the disruption of the nitrogen cycle (B. Clark 2002;\nClark and https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Introduction_ | 5\n\nYork 2005; Longo, Clausen and Clark 2015; Holleman 2018).4 Part I of the\ncurrent book develops the metabolic rift approach further as the theoretical\nand methodological foundation of Marxian political ecology. In addition to\nMarx, Part I enriches Marxian ecology by dealing with Friedrich Engels, Rosa\nLuxemburg, Lukács György and István Mészáros, because their texts help\ncomprehend the theoretical scope of the marginalized concept of ‘metabolism’\n\nin Marxism.\n\nHowever, this project is not simply about how to understand Marx’s concept of\nmetabolism more _correctly_. The task of developing Marxian ecology based on\nthe concept of metabolic rift is worth carrying out as it has a practical\nrelevance: different approaches to the ecological crisis will provide\ndifferent solutions to it. In this context, it is noteworthy that ‘post-\nMarxist’ attempts to conceptualize the human–nature relationship in the\nAnthropocene _against_ the concept of ‘metabolic rift’ have emerged. They are\ncommitted to philosophical monism. The proponents of the monist view\nproblematize an\n\n‘ontological dualism’ of Marxism (Castree 2013: 177) that they claim fails to\nadequately understand the ontological status of nature in the Anthropocene.\n\nSince capitalism thoroughly reconstructs the entire environment, nature as\nsuch does not exist, but is ‘produced’ through capitalist development.\nMonists, transcending ontological binarism, insist on replacing it with\nrelational thinking: everything is a ‘hybrid’ of nature and society. Jason W.\nMoore (2015) in particular directs this critique against the concept of\n‘metabolic rift’, claiming that it falls into the Cartesian dualism of\n‘Society’ and ‘Nature’. He instead puts forward a relational understanding of\nhuman–nature metabolism.\n\nYet monism once again revives a failed Prometheanism for the Anthropocene,\njustifying the ever-increasing intervention in nature. Such a\n\n‘geo-constructivist’ approach maintains that there is already too much human\nintervention in nature in the Anthropocene (Neyrat 2019). Therefore, any\nattempt to stop the intervention in fear of environmental destruction is\nirresponsible and disastrous because the process is irreversible. According to\nthe geo-constructivist approach, the only way forward is ‘stewardship’ of the\nearth by remaking the whole planet in order to secure human existence in the\nfuture, if not human emancipation. This revival of the Promethean project is\nsneaking into Marxist efforts to renew their vision of a post-capitalist\nfuture (Mason 2015; Srnicek and Williams 2016; Bastani 2019). In this context,\nPart II of this book offers a reply to various monist and Promethean currents\nin the Anthropocene through the lens of Marx’s methodological dualism.\n\nAfter critically examining the theoretical limitations of both monist and\nPromethean views, Part III elaborates on Marx’s ecological vision of a\npostcapitalist society in a non-productivist manner. Using the new insights\noffered by the _MEGA_ , it demonstrates that through interdisciplinary\nresearch in the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n6 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ natural sciences, humanities and social\nsciences, the late Marx experienced a theoretical breakthrough – _coupure\népistémologique_ in an Althusserian sense (Althusser 2005) – after 1868. His\nlast vision of post-capitalism in the 1880s went _beyond_ ecosocialism, and it\ncan be more adequately characterized as _degrowth communism_. This previously\nunknown idea of degrowth communism begets useful insights to transcend\npersistent ‘capitalist realism’. While there is growing interest in radical\napproaches today, it is not sufficient simply to develop an ecosocialist\ncritique of contemporary capitalism. Only by going back to Marx’s own texts is\nit possible to offer a positive vision of a future society for the\nAnthropocene. Such a radical transformation must be the new beginning of\nhistory as the age of degrowth communism.\n\nHowever, if Marx really did propose degrowth communism, why has no one pointed\nit out in the past, and why did Marxism endorse productivist socialism?\n\nOne simple reason is that Marx’s ecology was ignored for a long time. It is\nthus first necessary to trace back the moment of its suppression. This\ngenealogy of (suppressed) Marxian ecology starts with Marx himself. Referring\nto Marx’s notebooks on the natural sciences that are published in the _MEGA_ ,\nChapter 1 establishes Marx’s concept of ‘metabolic rift’ by highlighting the\nthree dimensions of the ecological rifts and their spatiotemporal ‘shifts’\nmediated by technologies on a global scale. This original insight into\ncapital’s constant expropriation of nature as the root cause of the metabolic\nrift was deepened by Rosa Luxemburg in _The_ _Accumulation of Capital_ , which\nproblematized the main ‘contradiction’ of capitalism due to its destructive\nimpacts upon the people and environment in non-capitalist peripheries.\n\nAlthough she employed the concept of ‘metabolism’, Luxemburg formulated it as\na _critique_ of Marx’s narrow view of capital accumulation.\n\nHer critique implies that Marx’s concept of metabolism was not properly\nunderstood even at that time. This misunderstanding was inevitable because\nmany of Marx’s writings were unpublished and unavailable to Luxemburg.\n\nYet this problem also originates in Engels’s attempt to establish ‘Marxism’\n\nas a systematic worldview for the proletariat. In order to trace the original\ndeformation of Marx’s concept of metabolism, Chapter 2 reconstructs Engels’s\nreception of Marx’s theory of metabolism by carefully comparing Engels’s\neditorial work on _Capital_ with Marx’s original economic manuscripts as well\nas their notebooks published in the _MEGA_. This investigation reveals subtle\nbut decisive theoretical differences between Marx and Engels, especially in\nterms of their treatment of metabolism. These differences prevented Engels\nfrom adequately appreciating Marx’s theory of metabolic rift, so the concept\nof metabolism came to be marginalized in Marxism.\n\nThis marginalization is clearly documented in the historical formation and\ndevelopment of Western Marxism in the 1920s, which further diverged\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Introduction_ | 7\n\nfrom Marx’s original insight into metabolism and his methodology. Here the\nproblem of the intellectual relationship between Marx and Engels came to have\na significant influence because it determined the entire paradigm of Western\nMarxism. Famously enough, Western Marxism highlighted the rigorous\ndifferentiation of Marx and Engels, accusing the latter’s illegitimate\nextension of dialectics to the sphere of nature as a cause of Soviet Marxism’s\nmechanistic social analysis. However, despite their harsh critique of Engels,\nWestern Marxists shared the fundamental assumption with Soviet orthodox\nMarxism that Marx had little to say about nature, thereby neglecting the\nimportance of his concept of metabolism and his ecological critique of\ncapitalism.\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, the founder of Western Marxism, Lukács György, is\nan exceptional figure in that he clearly paid attention to this concept of\nmetabolism. Although his critique of Engels’s treatment of nature in _History\nand Class Consciousness_ had an immense impact on Western Marxism, he actually\nhad a different approach to the problem of nature that was formulated as part\nof his theory of metabolism in his unpublished manuscript of 1925–6 titled\n_Tailism and the Dialectic_. This manuscript was unknown for a long time, so\nLukács’s intention in _History and Class_ _Consciousness_ was not properly\nunderstood, and he was repeatedly criticized for various theoretical\ninconsistencies and ambivalences. However, looking at _Tailism and the\nDialectic_ , it becomes clear that his treatment of the relationship between\nhumans and nature shows a continuity with Marx’s own dualist methodology that\nanalytically distinguished between the social and the natural. With this\nmethodology, Lukács’s theory of metabolism provides a way of developing Marx’s\n‘non-Cartesian’ dualism of _Form_ and _Matter_ as a critique of modern\ncapitalist production. Nevertheless, his unique insight was suppressed by both\northodox Marxism and Western Marxism, leading to the marginalization of\nMarxian ecology throughout the 20th century.\n\nSince Marx’s dualist method is not correctly understood, the concept of\nmetabolic rift continues to be exposed to various criticisms. Chapter 4 deals\nwith Marxist versions of the monist view represented by Jason W. Moore’s\n\n‘world ecology’ as well as by Neil Smith’s and Noel Castree’s ‘production of\nnature’. Despite their obvious theoretical differences, their monist\nunderstanding of capitalism shows how misunderstanding Marx’s method generates\nproblematic consequences that have practical relevancy.\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 5, the failure to understand Marx’s method also\nresults in the recent revival of the Promethean idea among Marxists.\n\nThese utopian Marxists draw upon Marx’s _Grundrisse_ and argue that a third\nindustrial revolution based on information technology (for example, artificial\nintelligence [AI], sharing economy and Internet of things [IoT]) combined with\nfull automation could liberate humans from the drudgery of work and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n8 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ make the capitalist system of value obsolete.\nDespite their celebration of dream technologies of the future, the old\nPrometheanism remains. In order to decisively abandon Prometheanism, it is\nnecessary to focus on Marx’s concept of ‘real subsumption’ in the 1860s – that\nis, not in the _Grundrisse_ written in the 1850s. Doing so reveals that Marx’s\ncritique of ‘productive forces of capital’ in _Capital_ represents a major\nshift in his view of technological progress under capitalism. Marx came to\nrealize that the capitalist development of technologies does _not_ necessarily\nprepare a material foundation for post-capitalism.\n\nHowever, his rejection of his earlier naïve endorsement of technological\ndevelopment posed a series of new difficulties for Marx. Once he started to\nquestion the progressive role of increasing productive forces under\ncapitalism, he was inevitably compelled to challenge his own earlier\nprogressive view of history. Chapter 6 reconstructs this process of self-\ncritique in the late Marx.\n\nOnly by paying attention to Marx’s theoretical crisis does it become clear why\nhe had to simultaneously study the natural sciences _and_ pre-capitalist\nsocieties while attempting to complete the subsequent volume of _Capital_. By\nintensively studying these theoretical fields, Marx ultimately went through\nanother paradigm shift after 1868. It is from this perspective that Marx’s\nletter to Vera Zasulich sent in 1881 needs to be reinterpreted as the\ncrystallization of his non-productivist and non-Eurocentric view of the future\nsociety, which should be characterized as degrowth communism.\n\nThis conclusion must be surprising to many. No one has previously proposed\nsuch a vision of Marx’s post-capitalism. Furthermore, degrowth economics and\nMarxism have had an antagonistic relationship for a long time. However, if the\nlate Marx accepted the idea of a steady-state economy for the sake of a\nradically equal and sustainable society, there will be a new space of dialogue\nbetween them. In order to start such a new dialogue in a fruitful manner, the\nfinal chapter will revisit _Capital_ and other writings and reread various\npassages from the perspective of degrowth communism. In a word, Chapter 7 aims\nat the reinterpretation of _Capital_ as an attempt to go beyond _Capital_. It\nwill offer a fresh reading of some key passages which would otherwise turn\ninto a naïve endorsement of productivism. Most notably, the radical abundance\nof ‘communal/common wealth’ ( _genossenschaftlicher_ _Reichtum_) in the\n_Critique of the Gotha Programme_ signifies a non-consumerist way of life in a\npost-scarcity economy which realizes a safe and just society in the face of\nglobal ecological crisis in the Anthropocene.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Introduction_ | 9\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nBill McKibben does not necessarily deny that pristine nature did not exist\neven before the 1990s. He instead highlights that the ‘idea’ of nature as\nindependent from human intervention can no longer be accepted as a valid\nconceptual tool due to the increasing human impacts upon nature. This\nsituation has to do with the recent popularity of monist approaches, as\ndiscussed in Chapter 4, although McKibben does not participate in these\ndebates.\n\n2\n\nEugene F. Stoermer already used the term ‘Anthropocene’ in the 1980s, although\nhe employed it in a different sense. A Russian geochemist, Vladimir I.\nVernadsky developed the concept of ‘biosphere’ in the 1920s in order to\nhighlight human impacts upon the biological life on a planetary scale, which\nhas relevance to today’s discussion of the Anthropocene (Vernadsky [1926]\n1997; Steffen et al.\n\n2011: 844).\n\n3\n\nNaomi Klein (2020) continues to argue for ‘democratic socialism’ in her more\nrecent book too. Thomas Piketty (2020) also advocates for ‘participatory\nsocialism’ not only for the sake of social equality but also for\nsustainability in the face of climate change. Their endorsement of ‘socialism’\nrepresents a major shift in the general political tone towards the left.\n\n4\n\nOther recent literature on the metabolic rift approach includes Moore (2000,\n2002), Mancus (2007), McMichael (2008), Gunderson (2011) and Weston (2014).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.001 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n**Part I**\n\n**Marx’s ecological critique of**\n\n\n## **caPitalisM aNd its oblivioN**\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n**1**\n\n**Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the**\n\n\n## **Age of Global Ecological Crisis***\n\nFor quite a long time, Marx’s interest in ecological issues was neglected even\namong serious Marxist scholars. Marx’s socialism was said to be characterized\nby a ‘Promethean’ (pro-technological, anti-ecological) advocacy for the\ndomination of nature. Marxists, on the one hand, reinforced this impression by\nnegatively reacting to environmentalism, which they believed to be inherently\nanti-working class and only functioning as an ideology of the upper middle\nclass. On the other hand, the environmental catastrophe in the USSR –\n\nmost notably represented by the ecological collapse of the Aral Sea and the\nChernobyl disaster – reinforced the conviction among environmentalists that\nsocialism cannot establish a sustainable society. As a consequence, there\nemerged a long-standing antagonism between the Red and the Green in the second\nhalf of the 20th century.\n\nThe situation is changing in the 21st century. No matter how devastating\nactually existing socialism was to the environment, its collapse and the\ntriumph of capitalism has only contributed to further ecological degradation\nunder neoliberal globalization in the last few decades. The ineffectiveness of\nconventional market-based solutions to ecological issues resulted in a renewed\ninterest in more heterodox approaches including Marxian economics (Burkett\n2006). At the same time, the collapse of the USSR and the declining influence\n\n* This chapter draws on material from ‘Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis’, _Historical Materialism_ 28, no. 2 (2020): 3–24.

This situation both within and without Marxism led to the\n‘rediscovery’ of Marx’s ecology in the last two decades (I).\n\nIt was Istvan Mészáros’s theory of ‘social metabolism’ that paved the solid\npath to this rediscovery. By investigating Mészáros’s theory of metabolism,\nmainly developed in _Beyond Capital_ and _The Necessity of Social Control_ ,\nMarx’s ecological theory of ‘metabolic rift’ can be more firmly founded upon\nhis critique of political economy (II). This clarification helps classify the\nthree different dimensions of ‘metabolic rift’ in Marx’s _Capital_ (III).\nCorrespondingly, there are three dimensions of _shifting_ the ecological rift,\nwhich is why capital proves so elastic and resilient in the face of economic\nand ecological crises. However, these\n\n‘metabolic shifts’ never solve the deep contradictions of capitalist\naccumulation.\n\nRather, they only create new crises, intensifying the contradictions on a\nwider scale (IV). This is what Rosa Luxemburg problematized in _The_\n_Accumulation of_ _Capital_ (1913), in which she applied the Marxian concept\nof ‘metabolism’ to the analysis of global unequal exchange under capitalism.\nDespite her intention in introducing the concept to _criticize_ Marx, her\nusage is actually compatible with Marx’s understanding of the metabolic rift.\nHer critique is worth discussing here because it indicates that the\nproblematic reception of Marx’s theory of metabolism was already taking place\nin the beginning of the 20th century, leading to its subsequent neglect (V).\n\n\n## **i**\n\n**the suPPressioN of Marx’s idea of ecosocialisM**\n\nSince the 1970s, Marx was repeatedly accused of a naïve ‘Promethean attitude’\n\n(Giddens 1981: 60): ‘Marx’s attitude toward the world always retained that\nPromethean thrust, glorifying the human conquest of nature’ (Ferkiss 1993:\n108). Even self-proclaimed Marxists admitted this flaw. For instance, Leszek\nKołakowski (1978: 412) maintained that ‘a typical feature of Marx’s\nPrometheanism is his lack of interest in the natural’. According to critics,\nMarx’s productivist view ignored the problem of natural limits and naively\npraised the free manipulation of nature: Marx was ‘largely uncritical of the\nindustrial system of technology and the project of human domination of nature’\n\n(J. Clark 1984: 27). They problematized Marx’s optimistic assumption, inherent\nto his ‘historical materialism’, that the development of the productive forces\nunder capitalism should be sufficient to provide a material basis for human\nemancipation. Due to the environmental degradation that occurred under\nactually existing socialism, environmentalists felt justified in denouncing\nthat https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 15\n\nsuch ‘a “productivist” “Promethean” view of history’ as completely\nunacceptable (Benton 1989: 82).1 The collapse of the USSR only multiplied\ncritical voices against Marx’s unecological view (Lipietz 2000).2\n\nThe image of Marx’s productivism remains widespread even today. Fredric\nJameson (2011: 150) points to ‘Marx’s own passionate commitment to a\nstreamlined technological future’. While Jameson is rather affirmative of such\na commitment, Axel Honneth (2017: 45) criticizes the limitation of Marxism in\nthat one of the inherent ideas of Marxism is ‘technological determinism’ that\nsupposes the linear progress of productive forces for the sake of ‘domination\nof nature’ ( _Naturbeherrschung_). According to such a view, it is inevitable\nfor Marxism that the question of ecology has been marginalized. As Nancy\nFraser (2014: 56) maintains, ‘[Marx’s thought] fails to reckon systematically\nwith gender, ecology and political power as structuring principles and axes of\ninequality in capitalist societies – let alone as stakes and premises of\nsocial struggle.’ Sven-Eric Liedman (2017: 480) concludes more explicitly that\nMarx was _not_ an ‘ecologically conscious person in the modern sense’.3\n\nFortunately, that is not the whole story. On the contrary, it is not an\nexaggeration to say that one of the most important developments in Marxian\nscholarship after the collapse of actually existing socialism in Eastern\nEurope is the ‘rediscovery’ of Marx’s ecological critique of capitalism\ninitiated by Paul Burkett (1999) and John Bellamy Foster (2000) in the\n_Monthly_ _Review_ as well as James O’Connor (1998), Joel Kovel (2007) and\nMichael Löwy (2015) in _Capitalism Nature Socialism_. Despite the tense\nrelationship between the two journals due to theoretical differences that\npivot around the concepts of ‘metabolic rift’ and the ‘second contradiction of\ncapitalism’\n\nrespectively, they both demonstrated convincingly that a Marxian approach is\nuseful to comprehend the ecological crisis as the manifestation of systemic\ncontradictions of the capitalist mode of production.4\n\nIn particular, Foster and Burkett clearly show that Marx was an ‘ecologically\nconscious person in the modern sense’. Carefully analysing Marx’s research in\nthe field of natural sciences – especially through a careful examination of\nMarx’s reception of Justus von Liebig’s theory of the robbery system of\nagriculture ( _Raubbau_) in his _Agricultural Chemistry_(1862) – Foster and\nBurkett revealed the importance of Marx’s theory of ‘metabolism’ (\n_Stoffwechsel_).5 Based on this concept of metabolism, Foster (2000)\nexplicates that Marx not only regarded the ‘metabolic rifts’ under capitalism\nas the inevitable consequence of the fatal distortion in the relationship\nbetween humans and nature but also highlighted the need for a qualitative\ntransformation in social production in order to repair the deep chasm in the\nuniversal metabolism of nature. Since ecology proves to be an integral part of\nMarx’s critique of political economy, his vision of post-capitalist society is\nreinterpreted as ‘ecosocialism’ (Pepper\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n16 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ 2002; Brownhill et al. 2022). Soon the concept\nof ‘metabolism’ came to be regarded as a ‘conceptual star’ (Fischer-Kowalski\n1997: 122) as it gave hope that this new idea of ‘ecosocialism’ might be\npossible to overcome the long-time antagonistic relationship between Red and\nGreen.\n\nToday, at least the existence of Marx’s ecology – its usefulness and\nscientific validity put aside for now – retrospectively appears so obvious\nthat one may wonder why it was neglected for such a long time. Here one can\npoint to one reason.6 The neglect of Marx’s ecology has to do with the\nunfinished character of his critique of political economy. It is well known\nthat Marx did not publish volumes II and III of _Capital_ during his lifetime.\nAfter Marx’s death, Engels edited and published them in 1885 and 1894,\nrespectively, based on various manuscripts written at different times.\nNotwithstanding, Marxist scholars simply took Engels’s edition of _Capital_ to\nbe the definitive version that truly reflected Marx’s own views. It did not\noccur to them that Marx, especially in his later years, quite intensively\nstudied the natural sciences and left behind a large number of notebooks\nconsisting of various excerpts and comments related to environmental issues.\nAlthough Marx began this new research after the publication of volume I of\n_Capital_ , he barely published after 1868\n\nand could nowhere elaborate on the results of his new research. Inevitably, it\nwas in these notebooks where Marx’s ecological insights are documented, but\nuntil their recent publication they remained neglected in the archive and\nunpublished throughout the course of the 20th century (Saito 2017; _MEGA_\nIV/18).\n\nIn fact, few scholars were interested in studying these notebooks. David\nRiazanov, who was the founder of the Marx–Engels Institute in Moscow in the\n1920s and the chief editor of the first _Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe_ (\n_MEGA1_), negatively commented on Marx’s later engagement with the natural\nsciences, dismissing the importance of the notebooks for understanding his\ncritique of political economy:\n\nIf in 1881–82 he lost his ability for intensive, independent, intellectual\ncreation, he nevertheless never lost the ability for research. Sometimes, in\nreconsidering these Notebooks, the question arises: Why did he waste so much\ntime on this systematic, fundamental summary, or expend so much labour as he\nspent as late as the year 1881, on one basic book on geology, summarizing it\nchapter by chapter. In the 63rd year of his life – that is inexcusable\npedantry. (Quoted in K. Anderson 2010: 249) Such a dismissive attitude towards\nthe late Marx only contributed to the widespread neglect of Marx’s interest in\necological issues. Some leading ecosocialists thus argue that Marxian ecology\n‘extrapolates the ecological in Marx from brief and vague excursions in texts\naddressing subjects other https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published\nonline by Cambridge University Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 17\n\nthan ecological dynamics’ (Engel-Di Mauro 2014: 137).7 However, the new\ncomplete works of Marx and Engels, the new _Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe_ ( _MEGA\n2_), have been publishing those new materials that document how Marx in his\nlater years developed his ecological critique of capitalism.8 The _MEGA_\nsubstantiates the claims made by a group of eco-Marxists, including myself,\nthat Marx’s theory of metabolism is the central pillar of his ecosocialist\ncritique of capitalism.\n\n**ii**\n\n\n## **the rediscovery of MarxiaN ecology**\n\nRetrospectively, the Hungarian Marxist István Mészáros made a great\ncontribution to properly comprehending Marx’s concept of metabolism as the\nfoundation of his political economy. It is no coincidence that Mészáros also\ndiscussed environmental issues under capitalism already in the 1970s. The\nforegrounding of Marx’s ecology in _Beyond Capital_ (Mészáros 1995) should be\nseen as the culmination of Mészáros’s long-standing engagement with Marx’s\nconcept of metabolism.\n\nIn 1971, Mészáros began the first Deutscher Prize Memorial Lecture by\nreferring to Isaac Deutscher’s warning about the prospect of nuclear war that\n‘threatens our biological existence’ (Deutscher 1967: 110). He went on to\nextend Deutscher’s warning to another contemporary existential crisis for the\n‘whole of mankind’ – that is, ecological destruction under capitalism.\n\nMészáros’s claim was provisional as it was made even before the publication of\n_The Limits to Growth_ by the Club of Rome in 1972. He formulated the\necologically destructive nature of capitalist development as the ‘basic\ncontradiction’ of capitalism as follows:\n\n[The] basic contradiction of the capitalist system of control is that it\ncannot separate ‘advance’ from destruction, nor ‘progress’ from waste –\nhowever catastrophic the results. The more it unlocks the powers of\nproductivity, the more it must unleash the powers of destruction; and the more\nit extends the volume of production, the more it must bury everything under\nmountains of suffocating waste. (Mészáros [1972] 2014: 49–50) Here Mészáros\nexplicitly differentiated himself from the orthodox Marxism of his time, which\nwas characterized by a naïve endorsement of the development of productive\nforces under capitalism as a progressive drive in human history.\n\nHe warned that the wasteful and destructive system of production for the sake\nof endless capital accumulation would not bring about human emancipation but\ninevitably undermine the material conditions for the prosperity of society in\nthe long run.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n18 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Since the earth is finite, it is obvious that\nthere are absolute biophysical limits to capital accumulation.9 Despite\nknowing this, capital is incapable of limiting itself. On the contrary,\ncapital constantly attempts to overcome these limits only to increase its own\ndestructiveness against society and nature.\n\nHence arises the ‘necessity of social control’ to put an end to the wasteful\nand destructive tendency of capitalist development for the sake of human\nsurvival and preservation of the natural environment. Such social planning of\nproduction is, however, incompatible with the basic logic of capitalist\nproduction. Mészáros thus demanded a qualitatively different organization of\nsocial production by freely associated producers.\n\nFifteen years later, in _Philosophy, Ideology and Social Science_(1986),\nMészáros formulated this issue of degradation and destruction of nature by\ncapital with the concept of metabolism for the first time, highlighting its\nimportance ‘to all serious theory of ecology’. According to him, the ultimate\nproblem lies in ‘capital’s _necessary_ inability to make the real distinction\nbetween the safely transcendable and the absolute, since it must assert –\n\nirrespective of the consequences – its own, historically specific,\nrequirements as absolute ones, following the blind dictates of self-expanding\nexchange-value’ (Mészáros 1986: 195). Conflating its historical necessity with\n‘natural necessity’, capital cannot recognize the true meaning of ‘natural\nnecessity’, which consists of the _elementary_ requirements of production\nconfined by the universal metabolism of nature. It instead behaves as if even\nthese absolute natural limits are transcendable – some might be actually\ntranscendable with the aid of science and technology but obviously not all –\nand aims to subjugate them for the sake of its further valorization, leading\nto the ‘degradation and ultimate destruction of nature’ (Mészáros 1986: 183).\nSince capital cannot recognize absolute limits, a ‘conscious _recognition_ of\nthe existing barriers’ as the condition of the universal development of the\nindividual is a revolutionary act.\n\nThis anti-Promethean insight into the limit to growth marks an important step\nto the fusion of environmentalism and socialism.\n\nYet it is with _Beyond Capital_ (1995) that Mészáros changed the whole\ndiscursive constellation around Marx’s ecology by elaborating on this concept\nof metabolism much more systematically.10 Mészáros focused on Marx’s concept\nof ‘social metabolism’ in order to analyse the capitalist mode of production\nas a historically unique way of (re)organizing the transhistorical metabolic\ninteraction between humans and nature on an unprecedented scale.\n\nHe intentionally highlighted the concept as an anti-thesis to the narrow focus\nof traditional Marxism on the theory of surplus value as a disclosure of the\nexploitation of the working class by the capitalist. Instead Mészáros intended\nto expand the theoretical scope of a critique of capitalism _outside_\nfactories. In fact, Marx characterized ‘a process of social metabolism’ as a\nflow of commodities https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online\nby Cambridge University Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 19\n\nand money through which the ‘product of one kind of useful labour replaces\nthat of another’ ( _Capital_ I: 198). Mészáros, following this insight of\nMarx, advocated for a much more holistic and integral approach to the\nhistorical dynamics of social production and reproduction under capitalism.\n\nAlthough its importance is still often underestimated, the concept of\nmetabolism is essential for Marx’s _Capital_. Marx defined ‘labour’, the most\nfundamental category of Marxism, in relation to the metabolism between humans\nand nature: ‘Labour is, first of all, a process between man and nature, a\nprocess by which man, through his own actions, mediates, regulates and\ncontrols the metabolism between himself and nature’ ( _Capital_ I: 283). This\nmetabolic process is, first of all, a natural-ecological process, which is\ncommon to any historical stage, because humans cannot live without working\nupon nature through labour: ‘It is the universal condition for the metabolism\n[ _Stoffwechsel_]\n\nbetween man and nature, the everlasting nature-imposed condition of human\nexistence, and it is therefore independent of every form of that existence, or\nrather it is common to all forms of society in which human beings live’\n\n( _Capital_ I: 290). Humans can never escape from being a part of the\n‘universal metabolism of nature’ ( _MECW_ 30: 63). This also means that humans\ncannot produce _ex nihilo_ but always _ex materia_. Food, clothes, houses and\neven the most high-tech goods that ‘dematerialize’ the economy use energy and\nnatural resources without exception. In this sense, human metabolism with\nnature is a ‘natural necessity’ that can never be suspended. This is why Marx\nwrote that labour works upon ‘a material substratum’ that exists without human\nintervention, and human labour ‘can only change the form of the materials’\n\n( _Capital_ I: 133).11\n\nFurthermore, humans are dependent upon nature. Marx highlighted that both\nlabour and nature play essential roles in the labour process: ‘Labour is\ntherefore not the only source of material wealth, i.e. of the use-values it\nproduces. As William Petty says, labour is the father of material wealth, the\nearth is its mother’ ( _Capital_ I: 134).12 Humans can work upon, consume and\ndiscard nature, but their activities are constrained by natural laws and\nvarious biophysical processes of the universal metabolism of nature. According\nto Mészáros (1995: 138), this unceasing interaction constitutes the ‘primary’\nlevel of the universal metabolic process between humans and nature, ‘without\nwhich humanity could not possibly survive even in the most ideal form of\nsociety’.\n\nOn a more concrete level, the exact ways humans carry out their metabolism\nwith the external environment differ significantly depending on the given\nobjective natural condition such as climate, location, and availability and\naccessibility of resources and energy. These dimensions of the primary level\nof metabolism have to do with the natural substratum, which remains as a\n‘historical absolute’ with its force: ‘For no matter to what degree this\nnatural https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n20 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ substratum might (indeed must) be modified by\nongoing human productive development, in the course the historical creation of\n“new needs” and the corresponding extension of the conditions of their\nsatisfaction, ultimately it always remains firmly circumscribed by nature\nitself ’ (Mészáros 2012: 246).\n\nSimilarly, Kate Soper (1995: 132) argues that ‘those material structures and\nprocesses that are independent of human activity (in the sense that they are\nnot a humanly created product), and whose forces and causal powers are the\nnecessary conditions of every human practice, and determine the possible forms\nit can take’. The objective existence of nature independently of humans\ncharacterizes the basic insight of materialism.\n\nHumans are, however, not simply confined by the given environment. They can\nreflect upon their own interaction with it. They can design tools to produce\nmore efficiently, improve the quality of products, discover new materials and\neven invent totally new objects according to their needs. This is the unique\ncharacter of human labour compared with other animals. As productive forces\nhistorically develop in this way, the objective conditions of production\nchange greatly through human history. Notwithstanding this, the primary\nmaterial condition remains throughout and cannot be abolished. The plasticity\nof nature does not negate its characteristic as a natural substratum of\nlabour. If humans ignore the natural substratum, such violation of natural law\ncauses multiple ecological contradictions such as pollution, resource scarcity\nand exhaustion.\n\nAt the same time, Marx cautioned that such a general description of the labour\nprocess can turn into a banal statement that humans are a part of nature and\nneed to live with nature. While incessant metabolism is a transhistorical\ncondition of survival that remains valid as long as humans live and work on\nthe earth, Marx pointed out that this way of ‘treating of the general\npreconditions of all production’ is hammered out into ‘flat tautologies’,\nwhich ‘indicate nothing more than the essential moments of all production’ (\n_Grundrisse_ : 86).\n\nThe uniqueness of his economic analysis is rather his recognition that labour\nis always carried out under a certain set of social relations. Mészáros\nsummarizes this point as the necessity of the social mediation of human\nmetabolism with nature: ‘There can be no escape from the imperative to\nestablish fundamental structural relationships through which the vital\nfunctions of primary mediation can be carried on for as long as humankind is\nto survive’ (Mészáros 1995: 139).\n\nOut of this imperative, a social structure emerges in the course of human\nhistory that is mediated by communication, cooperation, norms, institutions\nand law. Metabolism between humans and nature is, seen from this perspective,\nsimultaneously a socio-historical process whose concrete forms significantly\nvary according to the structural relationships that exist in different times\nand places. They constitute what Mészáros calls the ‘second order mediations\nof historically specific social reproductive systems’ (Mészáros 1995:\n139–40).13\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 21\n\nThe historical uniqueness of ‘second-order mediations’ under capitalism\nbecomes immediately obvious when we compare them with those in noncapitalist\nsocieties. Marx contrasted modern capitalist production with that of ancient\nsociety:\n\nWealth does not appear as the aim of production [in antiquity]…. The question\nis always which mode of property creates the best citizens….\n\nThus the old view, in which the human being appears as the aim of production,\nregardless of his limited national, religious, political character, seems to\nbe very lofty when contrasted to the modern world, where production appears as\nthe aim of mankind and wealth as the aim of production. ( _Grundrisse_ :\n487–8)\n\nThe primary goal of capitalist production is the valorization of capital above\nanything else. Capitalism is driven by the insatiable desire for profit-making\nand constantly increases the productive capacity. In contrast, in pre-\ncapitalist societies production was conducted for the sake of satisfying\nconcrete needs, and correspondingly the aim of production was use-values tied\nto the fulfilment of finite wants.\n\nWith the domination of this logic of capital for the sake of maximal\nvalorization and the limitless expansion of capital, historically specific\nsecond-order mediation emerges by developing the world market, technologies,\ntransportation and credit system, and artificial appetites. Capital wholly\ntransforms and reorganizes the entire world as Mészáros argues: Every one of\nthe primary forms [of metabolism between humans and nature] is altered almost\nbeyond recognition, so as to suit the self-expansionary needs of a fetishistic\nand alienating system of social metabolic control which must subordinate\nabsolutely everything to the imperative of capital-accumulation. (Mészáros\n1995: 140) Since there is no absolute limit in this process, capital is\n‘totalizing’, continuously expanding and subordinating all aspects of the\nproductive functions of both humans and nature to the imperative of capital\naccumulation. However, this\n\n‘capitalistically institutionalised second order mediation’ as in the case of\nwage labour, commodity exchange and private property is ‘alienated mediation’.\n\nHere one should note that it is characterized not only by the estrangement of\nlabour but also by the ‘alienation of nature’ (Mészáros 1970: 110–11).14\n\nSince his Deutscher Prize lecture in 1971, Mészáros remained convinced that\ncapital’s organization of social metabolism, with its second-order mediations,\nis incompatible with transhistorical material characteristics of metabolism\nbetween humans and nature on the primary level, leading to its degradation and\nultimate destruction in the long run.\n\nTo highlight this point, Mészáros used the expression ‘absolute limit’ of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n22 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ nature, which capital cannot overcome. It\nexists independently of capital, but capital cannot recognize the non-identity\nof nature and constantly aims to relativize the absolute in its attempt to\nbecome the absolute by totalizing the regime of capital. However, the\nsubjugation of the natural cycle that exists prior to and independently of the\nformation of the capitalist cycle ultimately disrupts and destroys the\nuniversal metabolism of nature. In the moment of ecological crisis, a\nfundamental problem of capitalist second mediation manifests itself due to the\nasymmetrical relationship between society and nature – namely, nature as the\nmaterial substratum can exist without humans, but not vice versa.\n\nToday capital is no longer productive, but rather destructive and threatens\nhuman existence. This is the moment when the ‘limits of capital’ become\ndiscernible:\n\nCapital’s limits can no longer be conceptualized as merely the material\nobstacles to a greater increase in productivity and social wealth, and thus as\na brake on development, but as the direct challenge to the very survival of\nmankind. And in another sense, the limits of capital can turn against it as\nthe overpowering controller of the social metabolism … when capital is no\nlonger able to secure, by whatever means, the conditions of its destructive\nself-reproduction and thereby causes the breakdown of the overall social\nmetabolism. (Mészáros 2014: 599) As capital cannot stop expanding, it\ncontinues to increase its destructive power. Mészáros added that ‘the capital\nsystem as a mode of social metabolic reproduction finds itself in its\ndescending phase of historical development, and therefore is only\ncapitalistically advanced but in no other sense at all, thereby capable of\nsustaining itself only in an ever more destructive and therefore ultimately\nalso self-destructive way’ (Mészáros 2012: 316). The development of capitalism\nno longer counts as ‘development’ because its inadequate mechanisms of social\ncontrol ultimately threaten humanity’s sheer survival. Mészáros differentiated\nhimself from orthodox Marxists in explicitly acknowledging that the robbery\ninherent in the capitalist development of productive forces does not bring\nabout progress leading to socialism.\n\nMészáros was presumably inspired by Lukács’s theory of metabolism and his\nHegelian discussion of the ‘identity of identity and non-identity’\n\n(see Chapter 4). Both Lukács and Mészáros recognized that society is a part of\nthe universal metabolism of nature as the latter encompasses everything and\nfunctions as a material foundation of all the kinds of human activity –\n\nhumans cannot even think without brains – but society does bring about new\nsocio-historical emergent properties and laws that do not exist without human\nbeings. However, even those purely social properties are not entirely free\nfrom the rest of nature. This dialectical relationship between the social\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 23\n\nand the natural constitutes the complex dynamics of the social and natural\nmetabolic processes that cannot be adequately grasped in the mechanical or\nsocial constructivist approaches.\n\n**iii**\n\n\n## **three diMeNsioNs of Metabolic rift**\n\nMészáros’s legacy of the theory of metabolism was later taken up by John\nBellamy Foster (2000) and Paul Burkett (1999), who have carefully examined\nMarx’s own usage of the concept of metabolism in various texts and developed\nthe key concept of ‘metabolic rift’. Its basic thesis is relatively simple:\nthe metabolic interaction of humans with the rest of nature constitutes the\nbasis of living, but the capitalist way of organizing human interactions with\ntheir ecosystems inevitably creates a great chasm in these processes and\nthreatens both human and non-human beings. Today, there are various attempts\nto analyse these rifts in terms of marine ecology (Stephano Longo), climate\nchange (Naomi Klein, Brett Clark, Richard York, Del Weston), the disruption of\nthe nitrogen cycle (Philip Mancus) and soil erosion (Hannah Holleman). These\nstudies confirm the validity and fruitfulness of Marx’s theory of metabolic\nrift.\n\nNevertheless, it is unfortunate that Marx did not elaborate on the concept of\n‘metabolic rift’ in detail in _Capital_. Marx warned against an ‘irreparable\nrift’ in social and natural metabolism only in one passage ( _Capital_ III:\n949).\n\nAs a consequence, despite Foster’s careful analysis of Marx’s writings and the\nfurther application of this concept to various contemporary ecological issues\nby other scholars, critics feel justified in insisting that ‘the implications\nof Foster’s thesis for contemporary thought are vague and the conclusions\natavistic’ (Loftus 2012: 31). Others also object that the ‘greening’ of Marx’s\ncritique of capitalism is an excessive imposition of ‘our’ concerns upon the\nrepresentative 19th century thinker, distorting and neglecting the existence\nof flaws and limitations in Marx’s theory (Tanuro 2003; Kovel 2007). These\ncriticisms are worth responding to here as they provide a good opportunity to\nclarify Marx’s concept of metabolic rift and its systematic character at the\nbeginning of this book. Even if the concept of rift may appear ‘sporadic’ in\nMarx’s writings, his theory of metabolism is actually profound and solid. In\nfact, there are good reasons to assume that he would have elaborated on the\nconcept of metabolic rift in more detail if Marx were able to finish _Capital_\n(Saito 2017).15 I argue that there are three dimensions of metabolic rift in\ntechnological as well as spatiotemporal terms.\n\nAs elucidated in _Capital_ , volume I, the transhistorical ‘labour process’\n\nreceives a new form as a ‘valorization process’ under capitalism, and its\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n24 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ biophysical processes of metabolism between\nhumans and nature are thoroughly transformed and reorganized for the sake of\ncapital’s valorization.\n\nThis deep transformation pivots around a certain aspect of labour, namely\n\n‘abstract labour’, as it possesses a uniquely capitalist function as the sole\nsource of ‘surplus-value’. Under the primacy of the logic of capital’s\nvalorization, not only the functioning of nature but also various aspects of\nconcrete labour in the labour process are forcefully abstracted and\nsubordinated to the primacy of (surplus-)value. Value as the objectification\nof abstract labour is nothing but the expenditure of human labour power in\ngeneral. When value becomes the organizing principle of metabolism between\nhumans and nature, it cannot fully reflect the complexity of the biophysical\nmetabolic processes between them. It even utilizes concrete labour and natural\nenvironment as externalities in order to extract more value. Marx thus\nmaintained that this transformation of the material world from the perspective\nof production of surplus-value has destructive consequences for both humans\n_and_ nature: ‘The same blind desire for profit that in the one case exhausted\nthe soil had in the other case seized hold of the vital force of the nation at\nits roots’ ( _Capital_ I: 348). Based on this theory of metabolism, Marx\nconsistently problematized the capitalist squandering of two fundamental\nfactors of production: ‘labour power’ ( _Arbeitskraft_) and ‘natural forces’ (\n_Naturkräfte_). The alienation of labour and of nature are mutually\nconstitutive of each other. In other words, capital not only exploits labour\npower but also subsumes the entire world, significantly affecting ‘space\n(scale)’ and ‘time (rate)’. With its ever-expanding and accelerating scale of\neconomy, capital brings about spatiotemporal transformations on an\nunprecedented level.\n\nAccording to Marx, metabolic rift appears in three different levels and forms.\nFirst and most fundamentally, metabolic rift is the material disruption of\ncyclical processes in natural metabolism under the regime of capital. Marx’s\nfavourite example is the exhaustion of the soil by modern agriculture. Modern\nlarge-scale, industrial agriculture makes plants absorb soil nutrition as much\nas and as fast as possible so that they can be sold to customers in large\ncities even beyond national borders. It was Justus von Liebig’s _Agricultural\nChemistry_(1862) and his theory of metabolism that prompted Marx to integrate\nan analysis of the\n\n‘robbery’ system of agriculture into _Capital_ (Foster 2000; Saito 2017).\n\nAs the German chemist warned in his path-breaking book, inorganic substances\nsuch as phosphor and potash are essential to plant growth, but their\navailability to plants is limited in terms of their naturally occurring\nquantities in the soil because the weathering process that disperses these\ninorganic substances, through the actions of the atmosphere and rain water,\ntakes quite a long time. Thus, Liebig highlighted the importance of respecting\nthe ‘law of replenishment’ ( _Gesetz des Ersatzes_) as the most fundamental\nprinciple of https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 25\n\n‘rational agriculture’ that demands the return of a sufficient amount of the\nminerals absorbed by plants to the original soil, if farmers are to maintain\nsoil fertility and secure long-term profitability. This necessity of\nreplenishment counts as the ‘primary mediation’ in that _all_ societies must\nrespect it, wherever and whenever you are.\n\nLiebig harshly criticized modern ‘robbery agriculture’ ( _Raubbau_), which\nonly aims at the maximization of short-term profit and lets plants absorb as\nmany nutrients from the soil as possible without replenishing them. Market\ncompetition drives farmers to large-scale agriculture, intensifying land usage\nwithout sufficient management and care. As a consequence, modern capitalist\nagriculture created a dangerous disruption in the metabolic cycle of soil\nnutrients. In order to highlight its danger, Liebig even warned about the\npotential collapse of European civilization due to soil exhaustion. Impressed\nby _Agricultural Chemistry_ , Marx in _Capital_ praised Liebig’s ‘immortal\nmerits’\n\nfor revealing ‘the negative, i.e. destructive side of modern agriculture’,\narguing: Capitalist production … causes the urban population to achieve an\never-growing preponderance…. [As a result, it] disturbs the metabolic\ninteraction between man and the earth, i.e. it prevents the return to the soil\nof the constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing;\nhence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for the\nlasting fertility of the soil. Thus it destroys at the same time the physical\nhealth of the urban worker, and the intellectual life of the rural worker…;\nall progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a\nprogress towards ruining the more long-lasting sources of that fertility.…\nCapitalist production, therefore, only develops the techniques and the degree\nof combination of the social process of production by simultaneously\nundermining the original sources of all wealth – the soil and the worker. (\n_Capital_ I: 637)\n\nHere Marx formulated the problem of soil exhaustion as a contradiction created\nby capitalist production in the metabolism between humans and nature.\n\nInsofar as value cannot fully take the metabolism between humans and nature\ninto account and capitalist production prioritizes the infinite accumulation\nof value, the realization of sustainable production within capitalism faces\ninsurmountable barriers.\n\nThis fundamental level of metabolic rift in the form of the disruption of\nmaterial flow cannot occur without being supplemented and reinforced by two\nfurther dimensions. The second dimension of metabolic rift is the _spatial\nrift_. Marx highly valued Liebig in _Capital_ because his _Agricultural_\n_Chemistry_ provided a scientific foundation for his earlier critical analysis\nof the social division of labour, which he conceptualized as the\n‘contradiction between town and country’ in _The German Ideology_ ( _MECW_ 5:\n64).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n26 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Liebig lamented that those crops that are sold\nin modern large cities do not return to the original soil after they are\nconsumed by the workers. Instead, they flow into the rivers as sewage via\nwater closets, only strengthening the tendency towards soil exhaustion.\n\nThis antagonistic spatial relationship between town and country – it can be\ncalled ‘spatial rift’ – is founded upon a violent process of so-called\nprimitive accumulation accompanied by depeasantization and massive urban\ngrowth of the working-class population concentrated in large cities. This not\nonly necessitates the long-distance transport of products but also\nsignificantly increases the demand for agricultural products in large cities,\nleading to continuous cropping without fallowing under large-scale\nagriculture, which is intensified even more through market competition. In\nother words, robbery agriculture does not exist without the social division of\nlabour unique to capitalist production, which is based upon the concentration\nof the working class in large cities and the corresponding necessity for the\nconstant transport of their food from the countryside.\n\nThis spatial rift also means the concentration of wastes in the city,\ndegrading its living conditions:\n\nUnder the heading of production we have the waste products of industry and\nagriculture, under that of consumption we have both the excrement produced by\nman’s natural metabolism and the form in which useful articles survive after\nuse has been made of them.… The natural human waste products … are of the\ngreatest importance for agriculture. But there is a colossal wastage in the\ncapitalist economy in proportion to their actual use. ( _Capital_ III: 195)16\n\nExcrement gave off a foul smell in the city of London at Marx’s time, and\ncholera became prevalent. The problem of environmental degradation, in terms\nof both the living conditions of the working class in the city and soil\nexhaustion in the countryside accompanied by the misery of peasants,\nrepresents a typical consequence of the antagonistic spatial separation within\na capitalist country.\n\nThis continues to widen in the course of capitalist development and even\ncreates an ‘irreparable rift’ in the metabolism between humans and nature on a\nglobal scale. Again, Marx problematized this contradiction, referring to\nLiebig:\n\n[In] this way [large-scale landownership] produces conditions that provoke an\nirreparable rift in the interdependent process between social metabolism and\nnatural metabolism prescribed by the natural laws of the soil. The result of\nthis is a squandering of the vitality of the soil, and trade carries this\ndevastation far beyond the bounds of a single country.\n\n(Liebig.) ( _MEGA_ II/4.2: 752–3)\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 27\n\nThis spatial rift only worsens with the expansion of capitalism, even though\nthe formation of the world market simultaneously creates a countertendency as\ndiscussed soon.\n\nAndreas Malm’s _Fossil Capital_ (2016) provides another example of how capital\nprofits from this antagonistic spatial organization. His work reconstructs the\nhistorical transition from water mills to steam engines fired by coal. River\nwater is abundant and free. In short, water is a perfectly sustainable and\nfree energy. This is an obvious but important fact, considering the prevailing\n‘Malthusian’ explanation for the development of new technologies.\n\nAccording to this type of explanation, the increasing scarcity of resources\nand their corresponding increase in price in the race for economic growth\nleads to the discovery or invention of other, cheaper substituting materials.\nMalm rejects this myth, arguing that it does not apply to the eclipse of free\nand abundant water-power and its replacement by the steam engine dependent on\nthe massive use of costly coal.\n\nIn order to explain this historical transition to fossil fuel, Malm argues, it\nis necessary to take into account the social dimension of the second-order\nmediation of ‘capital’. As Malm explains, the use of fossil fuels did not\nstart as a new substituent cheap energy resource but rather as fossil\n_capital_. The natural characteristics of coal, in contrast to water, as a\ntransportable energy source that was suitable to monopoly ownership, proved to\npossess a unique social significance for the development of capitalist\nproduction. River water cannot be moved and waterpower requires communal\nmanagement. Thanks to coal, capital was able to overcome these physical\nconstraints, leaving the areas near the rivers where workers were more\nresistant, since labour power was relatively scarce. Coal enabled capital to\nbuild new factories in large cities where a larger number of workers were in\ndire need of jobs. This was basically how the power balance between capital\nand labour radically changed with the invention of the steam engine. Yet this\nchange also intensified the antagonistic relationship between centre and the\nperiphery, degrading both the living conditions of workers in the former and\nthe natural environment in the latter.17\n\nThe third dimension of metabolic rift is the _temporal rift_. As is obvious\nfrom the slow formation of soil nutrients and fossil fuels and the\naccelerating circulation of capital, there emerges a rift between nature’s\ntime and capital’s time. Capital constantly attempts to shorten its turnover\ntime and maximize valorization in a given time – the shortening of turnover\ntime is an effective way of increasing the quantity of profit in the face of\nthe decreasing rate of profit (Saito 2018). This process is accompanied by\nincreasing demands for floating capital in the form of cheap and abundant raw\nand auxiliary materials ( _Capital_ III: 200–5). Furthermore, capital\nconstantly revolutionizes the production process, augmenting productive forces\nwith an unprecedented https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published\nonline by Cambridge University Press\n\n28 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ speed compared with precapitalist societies.\nProductive forces can double or triple with the introduction of new machines,\nbut nature cannot change its formation processes of phosphor or fossil fuel,\nso ‘it was likely that productivity in the production of raw materials would\ntend not to increase as rapidly as productivity in general (and, accordingly,\nthe growing requirements for raw materials)’ (Lebowitz 2009: 138). This\ntendency can never be fully suspended because natural cycles exist\nindependently of capital’s demands. Capital cannot produce without nature, but\nit also wishes that nature would vanish.\n\nWhen nature cannot catch up with the accelerating speed of capital, there\narises a grave discrepancy between two kinds of time that are particular to\nnature and capital. Marx gives the following example of excessive\ndeforestation under capitalism:\n\nThe long production time (which includes a relatively slight amount of working\ntime), and the consequent length of the turnover period, makes forest culture\na line of business unsuited to private and hence to capitalist production, the\nlatter being fundamentally a private operation, even when the associated\ncapitalist takes the place of the individual. The development of civilization\nand industry in general has always shown itself so active in the destruction\nof forests that everything that has been done for their conservation and\nproduction is completely insignificant in comparison. ( _Capital_ II: 321–2)\n\nThe same problem can be found with the long time required for the natural\nformation of fossil fuels and capital’s increasing demand for it. Long before\npeak oil became an issue for discussion, the possible exhaustion of British\ncoal was a major social concern in Marx’s time in its competition with the\nUnited States (US) economy (Jevons 1865).18\n\nIn reality, three dimensions of metabolic rift are interrelated and mutually\nreinforcing. Through technological media such as telecommunication, railways\nand airplanes, there occurs ‘time–space compression’ that aims to annihilate\nspatial and temporal distance by speeding up in favour of a shorter circuit of\ncapital (Harvey 1990). The social construction of time and space by capital\nexerts great objective force, with which capital’s second-order mediation\nradically transforms the relationship between humans and nature. Ultimately,\nthis reorganization under the logic of capital intensifies the grave tension\nbetween social and natural metabolism. Marx was, however, not simply satisfied\nwith acknowledging the static existence of such rifts but more interested in\nhow they emerge in nature and how they are spatially and temporally\n(re)distributed in a disproportionate manner.\n\nThis is the reason why Marx, in his later years, studied natural science\nintensively in order to comprehend the historical dynamics of capital\naccumulation and its ecological consequences.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 29\n\n**iv**\n\n\n## **three diMeNsioNs of Metabolic shift**\n\nThe contradiction of capitalist accumulation is that increases in the social\nproductivity are accompanied by a decrease in natural productivity due to\nrobbery:\n\nIt is possible for the increase in the social productivity of agriculture\nsimply to compensate for a decline in natural productivity, or not even to do\nthis much – and this compensation can only be effective for a certain period –\nso that despite the technical development, the product does not become cheaper\nbut is simply prevented from becoming dearer. ( _Capital_ III: 901)\n\nIt is thus essential for capital to secure stable access to cheap resources,\nenergy and food.19 This is what drives capital to construct ‘a system of\ngeneral exploitation of the natural and human qualities’ and ‘a system of\ngeneral utility’\n\nas Marx argued in the _Grundrisse_ :\n\nHence exploration of all of nature in order to discover new, useful qualities\nin things; universal exchange of the products of all alien climates and lands;\nnew (artificial) preparation of natural objects, by which they are given new\nuse values. The exploration of the earth in all directions, to discover new\nthings of use as well as new useful qualities of the old; such as new\nqualities of them as raw materials etc. ( _Grundrisse_ : 409) This is how\ncapital strives to be a universal system, but this process is also accompanied\nby the universalization of its own contradiction.\n\nThe exploration of the earth and the invention of new technologies cannot\nrepair the rift. The rift remains ‘irreparable’ in capitalism. This is because\ncapital attempts to overcome rifts without recognizing its own absolute\nlimits, which it cannot do. Instead, it simply attempts to relativize the\nabsolute. This is what Marx meant when he wrote ‘every limit appears a barrier\nto overcome’\n\n( _Grundrisse_ : 408).20 Capital constantly invents new technologies, develops\nmeans of transportation, discovers new use-values and expands markets to\novercome natural limits. This is how it constantly ‘shifts’ the metabolic rift\nto other social groups living somewhere else, not only for the sake of buying\ntime but also for minimizing the manifestation of negative effects in the\ncentres through the hierarchical integration of the peripheries (Clark and\nYork 2008). ‘Metabolic shift’ is a typical _reaction_ of capital to the\neconomic and ecological crisis it causes: ‘For only the reactive and\nretroactive manipulation of symptoms and effects is compatible with the\ncontinuing rule of capital’s _causa sui_ ’ (Mészáros 2012: 87). Metabolic\nshift, however, cannot solve the problem as long as it cannot stop its\ninsatiable process of accumulation.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n30 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ This is why Marx declared that ‘the _true\nbarrier_ to capitalist production is _capital itself_ ’ ( _Capital_ III: 358;\nemphasis in original).\n\nCorresponding to the three dimensions of metabolic rifts, there are also three\nways of shifting them. First, there is _technological shift_. Although Liebig\nwarned about the collapse of European civilization due to robbery agriculture\nin the 19th century, his prediction apparently did not come true. This is\nlargely thanks to Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, who invented the so-called\nHaber-Bosch process in 1906 that enabled the industrial mass production of\nammonia (NH ) by fixing nitrogen from the air, and thus of chemical 3\n\nfertilizer to maintain soil fertility. Historically speaking, the problem of\nsoil exhaustion due to a lack of inorganic substances was largely resolved\nthanks to this invention. Nevertheless, the Haber-Bosch process did not heal\nthe rift but only shifted, generating other problems on a larger scale.\n\nThe production of NH uses a massive amount of natural gas as a source 3\n\nof hydrogen (H). In other words, it squanders another limited resource in\norder to produce ammonia as a remedy to soil exhaustion, but it is also quite\nenergy intensive, producing a lot of carbon dioxide (CO ) (responsible for 1\nper cent 2\n\nof the total carbon emission in the world). Furthermore, excessive\napplications of chemical fertilizer leach into the environment, causing\neutrophication and red tide, while nitrogen oxide pollutes water.\nOverdependence on chemical fertilizer disrupts soil ecology, so that it\nresults in soil erosion, low water- and nutrient-holding capacity, and\nincreased vulnerability to diseases and insects (Magdoff and van Es 2010).\nConsequently, more frequent irrigation, a larger amount of fertilizer and more\npowerful equipment become necessary, together with pesticides. This kind of\nindustrial agriculture consumes not just water but large quantities of oil\nalso, which makes agriculture a serious driver of climate change.21 As Vandana\nShiva points out, the robbery character of agriculture has not changed since\nLiebig’s time: ‘Contemporary societies across the world stand on the verge of\ncollapse as soils are eroded, degraded, poisoned, buried under concrete and\ndeprived of life’ (Shiva 2015: 173).\n\nWhile soil exhaustion due to robbery agriculture is limited to a piece of\nland, agrochemicals leak to the environment with water and disrupt the normal\nfunctioning of ecosystems. In short, metabolic shift creates externalities\nwith the aid of new technologies. Soil fertility is artificially maintained\nand even strengthened, while capital does not pay for by-products. The\ncreation of externalities is also an effective way to obscure the\nresponsibility of companies for environmental problems due to the difficulty\nof proving the direct causation. Even if the responsibility is clarified and\nthe relevant costs are internalized, the original conditions of the\nenvironment often never recover to their original state. At the same time,\ncapital finds new business opportunities in these disruptions, taking the\nopportunity to sell more commodities such\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 31\n\nas chemical fertilizer and pesticide to the farmers. In other words, nature’s\nbiological systems are not mere obstacles or barriers for capital but their\ndegradation creates new sources of profit. Capital utilizes nature as a\n‘vehicle for accumulation’ (Kloppenburg 1988).\n\nFollowing Kloppenburg’s insight, Boyd, Prudham and Schurman (2001) extended\nMarx’s concept of ‘formal’ and ‘real subsumption under capital’ to nature.\nAccording to Marx, ‘formal subsumption’ of labour under capital simply\nsubjugates workers to the command of capital without changing the way they\nwork (that is, the production of ‘absolute surplus value’), while\n\n‘real subsumption’ of labour reorganizes the entire produces of production in\nfavour of capital accumulation through cooperation, division of labour and\nmechanization (that is, the production of ‘relative surplus value’).\nSimilarly, the\n\n‘formal subsumption’ of nature is the simple exploitation of natural processes\nfor the sake of commodity production in nature-based industries without\ncapital’s technological intervention in natural cycles and processes (for\nexample, finding new sites of extraction, usage of machinery, developing\npreservation system). In contrast, ‘real subsumption’ of nature aims at\nmanipulating biological processes with the aid of technologies so that nature\nis ‘(re)made to work harder, faster, and better’ (Boyd, Prudham and Schurman\n2001: 564).\n\nReal subsumption of nature fundamentally changes the natural metabolic cycle.\nExamples include growth hormones, synthetic fertilizers, pesticides as well as\nnew biotechnologies, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and biomedical\nimplants. In this manner, capital creates opportunities for opening new\nmarkets in the midst of metabolic rift. Consequently, peasants and farmers\nbecome more and more dependent upon commodities such as seeds, fertilizers and\npesticides provided by giant agribusiness companies.\n\nThe real subsumption of nature deprives them of traditional knowledge as well\nas autonomy and independence in the production process. Furthermore, such\ncommodification induces the concentration of capital in the sphere of\nagricultural production because the industrialization of operations and\nmaterials increases the minimum amount of capital to continue production on\nthe level of socially average level ( _Capital_ III: 359).\n\nAfter all, metabolic rift cannot be fully repaired unless the universal\nmetabolism of nature is mediated in a _qualitatively_ different manner by\nfreely associated producers. Thus, there remains a constant need to shift the\nrift under capitalism, which continues to bring about new problems. This\ncontradiction becomes more discernible in considering the second type of\nshifting the metabolic rift – that is, _spatial shift_ , which expands the\nantagonism of the city and the countryside to a global scale in favour of the\nGlobal North. Spatial shift creates externality by a geographic displacement\nof ecological burdens to another social group living somewhere else. Again,\nMarx discussed this issue https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published\nonline by Cambridge University Press\n\n32 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ in relation to soil exhaustion in core\ncapitalist countries in the 19th century.\n\nOn the coast of Peru there were small islands consisting of the excrement of\nseabirds called _guano_ that had accumulated over many years to form ‘guano\nislands’. ‘Guano’ means agricultural fertilizer in the Andean Indigenous\nlanguage Quechua, and the Indigenous people traditionally employed it as dung.\nIn fact, guano is quite rich in minerals such as phosphate and nitrogen.\n\nIt was Alexander von Humboldt who encountered the Indigenous usage of guano\nduring a research trip to Peru in 1802. He investigated the effectiveness of\nguano and tested it on European soils. Guano turned out to be quite effective\nand its usage became quite popular as the best natural fertilizer across those\nareas of Europe and the United States (Cushman 2013).\n\nThis spatial shift helped a gradual decoupling of agricultural production from\nnutrient cycles within a given territory. Massive import of guano enabled\nexponential urbanization in capitalist centres. As natural conditions of\nproduction faded away from workers’ everyday life, they came to share a\nperception of nature close to that of capitalists and landowners: the idea\nthat nature is a depository of resources that can be freely exploited by\nhumans.\n\nMarx wrote about this formation of a new common sense of the English people\nabout moving the conditions of production to somewhere else in favour of their\nown affluence:\n\nAgriculture no longer finds the natural conditions of its own production\nwithin itself, naturally, arisen, spontaneous, and ready to hand, but these\nexist as an independent industry separate from it – and, with this\nseparateness the whole complex set of interconnections in which this industry\nexists is drawn into the sphere of the conditions of agricultural production….\nThis pulling-away of the natural ground from the foundations of every\nindustry, and this transfer of its conditions of production outside itself,\ninto a general context – hence the transformation of what was previously\nsuperfluous into what is necessary, as a historically created necessity – is\nthe tendency of capital. The general foundation of all industries comes to be\ngeneral exchange itself, the world market, and hence the totality of the\nactivities, intercourse, needs etc. of which it is made up. ( _Grundrisse_ :\n527–8)\n\nIn the course of capitalist development, what used to be considered ‘luxury’ –\n\nsomething not ‘naturally necessary’ ( _Grundrisse_ : 527) – becomes\n‘necessary’.\n\nThis change of appetite occurs to the working class too. By externalizing the\nmaterial conditions of production, the working class in the Global North came\nto exploit others in the Global South, and in this way, new luxuries are\nadopted by the working class. This is how the ‘imperial mode of living’ of the\ncapitalist centres spreads all over the society (Brand and Wissen 2021).\n\nBy constantly shifting the ecological rifts and making them invisible to the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 33\n\ncapitalist centre, the current capitalist order of society appears attractive\nand comfortable for a wide range of social groups in the Global North. It thus\nfacilitates a general social consensus, while its real costs are imposed upon\nother social groups in the Global South.\n\nIn the 19th century, guano became ‘necessary’ to sustain soil fertility in\nEurope. Millions of tons of guano were dug up and continuously exported to\nEurope, resulting in its rapid exhaustion. Extractivism was accompanied by the\nbrutal oppression of Indigenous people and the severe exploitation of\nthousands of Chinese ‘coolies’ working under cruel conditions. Ultimately, the\nexhaustion of guano reserves provoked the Guano War (1865–6) and the Saltpetre\nWar (1879–84) in the battle for the remaining guano reserves. As John Bellamy\nFoster and Brett Clark (2009) argue, such a solution in favour of the Global\nNorth resulted in ‘ecological imperialism’. Although ecological imperialism\nshifts the rift to the peripheries and makes its imminent violence invisible\nin the centre, the metabolic rift only deepens on a global scale through long-\ndistance trade, and the nutrient cycle becomes even more severely disrupted.\n\nEcological imperialism is accompanied by ‘ecologically unequal exchange’\n\nof free energy and materials (Hornborg 2012). Its impacts are not fully\nrepresented in the unequal exchange of value, but it is essential to the\nprocess of capital accumulation. The centre accumulates more wealth and\nbecomes more affluent, while the periphery remains underdeveloped or becomes\neven more impoverished. The negative consequences of the rift, such as\nexhaustion of resources, corporeal rift of slaves and environmental pollution,\ndisproportionally emerge in those peripheries from which resources are\nconstantly extracted and transported to the centre (Martinez-Alier 2002:\n213).22 This is representative of the spatial shift as a way of organizing the\nentire world that can be aptly called capitalist system.23\n\nThe third dimension of metabolic shift is the _temporal shift_. The\ndiscrepancy between nature’s time and capital’s time does not immediately\nbring about an ecological disaster because nature possesses ‘elasticity’. Its\nlimits are not static but modifiable to a great extent (Akashi 2016). Climate\ncrisis is a representative case of this metabolic shift. Massive CO emissions\n2\n\ndue to the excessive usage of fossil fuels is an apparent cause of climate\nchange, but the emission of greenhouse gas does not immediately crystallize as\nclimate breakdown. Capital exploits the opportunities opened up by this time\nlag to secure more profits from previous investments in drills and pipelines.\nSince capital reflects the voice of current shareholders, but not that of\nfuture generations, the costs are shifted onto the latter. As a result, future\ngenerations suffer from consequences for which they are not responsible.\n\nMarx characterized such an attitude inherent to capitalist development with\nthe slogan ‘Après moi le déluge!’ ( _Capital_ I: 381).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n34 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ This time lag generated by a temporal shift\nalso induces a hope that it would be possible to invent new epoch-making\ntechnologies to combat against the ecological crisis in the future. In fact,\none may think that it is better to continue economic growth which promotes\ntechnological development, rather than over-reducing carbon dioxide emissions\nand adversely affecting the economy (Nordhaus 1991). However, even if new\nnegative emission technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) are\ninvented, it will take a long time for them to spread throughout society and\nreplace the old ones. In the meantime, the environmental crisis will continue\nto worsen due to our current inaction. As a result, the expected effects of\nthe new technology can be cancelled out. Barry Commoner already argued in the\n1970s with regard to pesticides that ‘in each case the new technology has\nworsened the environmental impact of the economic good’ (Commoner 1971: 153).\n\nThe same logic applies here. Furthermore, technological solutions sound\nattractive because they do not entail us changing our current lifestyle. In\nthis case, the hope for new technologies functions as an ideology to\nlegitimize the further usage of fossil fuels by temporally shifting the\ncontradiction to the future. Mészáros thus warned against technocratic\noptimism: ‘And finally, to say that “science and technology can solve all our\nproblems in the long run” is much worse than believing in witchcraft’\n(Mészáros 2014: 29).\n\n\n## **v**\n\n### **rosa luxeMburg’s theory of MetabolisM**\n\n\n## **aNd its oblivioN**\n\nThe elastic power of capital to shift the metabolic rift is quite astonishing\nas the history of capitalism demonstrates. Bill McKibben once formulated the\nhistorical dynamics of capitalism and ecological disaster in the following\nmanner: ‘The diminished availability of fossil fuel is not the only limit we\nface. In fact, it’s not even the most important. Even before we run out of\noil, we’re running out of planet’ (McKibben 2007: 18). This is not only\nbecause capital can constantly find new opportunities for a ‘climate-change\nshock doctrine’ (Klein 2019: 36) amidst the ecological crisis but also because\nit always shifts and externalizes the negative consequences to the sink in the\nGlobal South. In this way, the Global South suffers from doubly negative\nconsequences. After suffering from the robbery of nature and labour power\nunder ecological imperialism, it first faces the real impact of ecological\ncrisis. As Stephan Lessenich (2018: 166) argues, the capitalist slogan ‘After\nus, the deluge!’ becomes ‘Next to us, the deluge!’\n\nin an age of global ecological crisis when it is no longer possible to buy\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 35\n\ntime before the deluge – be it heavy rain and flooding, or refugee flows and\nimmigration waves. This is the essence of the ‘externalization society’\n\nprevailing in the affluent Global North.\n\nIn the Marxist tradition, it was Rosa Luxemburg who attempted to develop the\nconcept of ‘metabolism’ to conceptualize this unequal relationship between\ncapitalist centres and non-capitalist peripheries as the essential condition\nfor capital accumulation. In _The Accumulation of Capital_ , Luxemburg\ncriticized the destructive impact of capitalist development upon non-\ncapitalist societies, even arguing that capitalism was borne fundamentally in\na non-capitalist environment. In other words, capitalism is from the very\nbeginning dependent on unequal exchange that provides not simply cheap but\noften _free_ labour power of slaves as well as natural resources for the\ncentre.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Luxemburg formulated her own thesis _against_ Marx’s\ntheory of capital reproduction in volume II of _Capital_ because in her view\nhe treated English capitalism as if it were an independent and autarchic\nentity within which capital can reproduce itself without paying sufficient\nattention to its deep dependence on the extraction from non-capitalist\nsocieties: The Marxian schema of expanded reproduction thus does not\ncorrespond to the conditions of accumulation, as long as this is able to\nproceed; it cannot be conjured up out of the fixed, reciprocal relationships\nand dependencies between the two great departments of social production\n\n… as formulated by the schema. Accumulation is not merely an internal relation\nbetween the branches of the capitalist economy – it is above all a relation\nbetween capital and its noncapitalist milieu, in which each of the two great\nbranches of production can partially go through the accumulation process under\nits own steam, independently of the other, although the movement of each\nintersects, and is intertwined, with the other at every turn. (Luxemburg\n[1913] 2015: 303) Nevertheless, when she further described this process of\nunequal transportation of labour power and natural resources from the\nperiphery to the centre, she took up Marx’s concept of metabolism, clearly\ninfluenced by his usage of\n\n‘social metabolism’ in _Capital_ :\n\nWhile it is true that capitalism lives from noncapitalist formations, it is\nmore precise to say that it lives from their ruin; in other words, while this\nnoncapitalist milieu is indispensable for capitalist accumulation, providing\nits fertile soil, accumulation in fact proceeds at the expense of this milieu,\nand is constantly devouring it. Historically speaking,\n\n_the accumulation of capital is a process of metabolism occurring between_\n_capitalist and precapitalist modes of production_. The accumulation of\ncapital cannot proceed without these precapitalist modes of production, and\nyet accumulation consists in this regard precisely in the latter being\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n36 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ gradually swallowed up and assimilated by\ncapital. Accordingly, capital accumulation can no more exist without\nnoncapitalist formations, than these are able to exist alongside it. It is\nonly in the constant and progressive erosion of these noncapitalist formations\nthat the very conditions of the existence of capital accumulation are given.\n\n(Luxemburg [1913] 2015: 302; emphasis added)\n\nHer use of the term ‘metabolism’ indicates that she actually comprehended the\nemergence of serious metabolic rift on the international level. The problem of\nsuch a violent process of accumulation is not just about value transfer\nthrough unequal exchange of value nor severe exploitation of workers.\n\nIt is fundamentally a process of expropriating labour power, energy and\nresources through ecologically unequal exchange (Moore 2000: 138). Here labour\nconducted by certain groups of humans such as slaves, the indigenous and women\nis exploited as ‘free gift’ to capital. Capital cannot stop such exploitation\nand expropriation from non-capitalist milieu but even reinforces them because\nthis unequal transfer is constitutive of capitalist production: ‘It becomes\nnecessary for capital progressively to dispose ever more fully of the whole\nglobe, to acquire an unlimited choice of means of production, with regard to\nboth quality and quantity, so as to find productive employment for the surplus\nvalue it has realised’ (Luxemburg [1913] 2015: 258).\n\nLuxemburg found the absolute limit to capital in its dependence upon this kind\nof unequal exchange with the Global South. Capitalism strives to be a\nuniversal system, but it cannot be as long as it is essentially dependent on\nthe non-capitalist system. When it becomes universal, it must break down\nbecause the exhaustion of externality is fatal for the externalization\nsociety: Capitalism is the first form of economy with propagandistic power; it\nis a form that tends to extend itself over the globe and to eradicate all\nother forms of economy – it tolerates no other alongside itself. However, it\nis also the first that is unable to exist alone, without other forms of\neconomy as its milieu and its medium. Thus, as the same time as it tends to\nbecome the universal form, it is smashed to smithereens by its intrinsic\ninability to be a universal form of production. (Luxemburg\n\n[1913] 2015: 341)\n\nCapital is destined to expand, so it cannot tolerate any intrusion of\nregulation that hinders this tendency, but this only increases its own\ncontradiction in the long run.\n\nIn a sense, the Anthropocene represents a situation where the externality as\nthe precondition for capital accumulation has been exhausted.\n\nThe competition for robbery and externalization becomes more intensified with\nthe rapid development of the BRICs. The problem is not simply\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 37\n\nthat cheap nature is no longer available. As the space for externalization\ndiminishes, the once-obscured metabolic rift becomes increasingly visible even\nin the Global North as climate crisis influences heatwaves, wildfires and\nsuper typhoons. Reflecting upon this situation, Immanuel Wallerstein (2013:\n23) admitted that the ‘normality of externalization is a distant memory’. He\npointed out that the capitalist system is in terminal crisis now approaching\nthe ‘bifurcation’ point of replacing the old system with a new one in which\nthe ‘issue of ecological degradation … is a central locus of this debate’\n(Wallerstein 1999: 10).24 It is increasingly visible today that the ‘imperial\nmode of living’ cannot be universalized, but this situation is fatal to\ncapitalism. The contradiction of capitalism in the Anthropocene forces humans\nto rethink the legitimacy and effectiveness of capitalist social control as it\ncomes to severely interfere with ‘the elementary imperative of mere survival’\n(Mészáros 2012: 34).\n\nLuxemburg intended to expand Marx’s theory of primitive accumulation, but she\nformulated her theory of metabolism _against_ Marx, who she thought focused\nsolely on Western capitalism. Yet one passage in the chapter on primitive\naccumulation in volume I of _Capital_ clearly refers to the destructive\nprocess in the periphery of capitalism as an essential component of the\nformation of capitalism:\n\nThe discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and\nentombment in mines of the indigenous population of that continent, the\nbeginnings of the conquest and plunder of India, and the conversion of Africa\ninto a preserve for the commercial hunting of black-skins, are all things\nwhich characterize the dawn of the era of capitalist production. These idyllic\nproceedings are the chief moments of primitive accumulation. ( _Capital_ I:\n915)\n\nOf course, this is only a short passage, so Luxemburg criticized him despite\nher awareness of this passage: ‘Yet we must bear in mind that all this is\ntreated solely with a view to so-called primitive accumulation. For Marx,\nthese processes are incidental, illustrating merely the genesis of capital,\nits first appearance in the world; they are, as it were, travails by which the\ncapitalist mode of production emerges from a feudal society’ (Luxemburg\n\n[1913] 2015: 345). In other words, Marx treated capitalism as a self-\nsufficient system once it is established as such. However, as discussed in\nChapter 6 of this book, Marx _after the publication_ of volume I of _Capital_\nin 1867\n\ncritically reflected upon this point, intensively studying pre-capitalist and\nnon-Western societies. Consequently, Marx corrected his understanding of\ncapitalism and learned to envision a path to communism in a fully different\nway after the 1870s.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n38 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ However, Marx was not able to elaborate on his\nnew ideas during his lifetime – except his brief reference to this problem in\nhis co-authored preface to the Russian edition of _The Communist Manifesto_.\nIn this sense, Luxemburg was certainly justified at the time to criticize\nMarx’s theory of capital accumulation for its narrow focus on Western\ncapitalism. Although her concept of metabolism could have developed and\nenriched theoretical possibilities already inherent in _Capital_ , her\ncriticism directed against Marx resulted in heated debates in the Second\nInternational, which hindered the development of Marx’s theory of metabolism\nthereafter. However, there was a deeper theoretical reason for the\nmarginalization of the concept of metabolism in the history of Marxism. The\ntemptation to marginalize this concept – and correspondingly the question of\nMarx’s ecological critique of capitalism – can be found _before_ the Second\nInternational. Its origin can be traced back to Engels.25 He must have known\nof Marx’s serious engagement with the questions of natural science as well as\nnon-Western societies, but he did not highlight this point. Here his\nunderstanding indicates some tension with Marx’s theory of metabolism. It is\nthus necessary to reinvestigate the intellectual relationship between Marx and\nEngels from an ecological perspective in order to comprehend why Marx’s\nconcept of metabolism was marginalized for such a long time.\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nNot all Marxists ignored environmental concerns in the 1960s and 1970s, when\nenvironmental degradation became a pressing issue. Referring to _The Limits\nto_ _Growth_ , Ernest Mandel expressed his concern in a lecture, for example:\nOne has not necessarily to accept the predictions of unavoidable absolute\nscarcity of energy and raw materials of the Club of Rome type in order to\nunderstand that there is a collective responsibility for the present\ngeneration of humanity to transmit to future generations an environment and a\nstock of natural wealth that constitute the necessary precondition for the\nsurvival and flowering of human civilization.\n\n(Mandel 1995: 103–4)\n\nEven if Mandel did not explicitly refer to Marx in this passage, a Marxian\ncritique of capitalism also inspired ecological economists such as Karl\nWilliam Kapp ([1963] 2000), Barry Commoner (1971) and Shigeto Tsuru (1976).\nThe widespread anti-ecological characterization of Marxism turns out to be\noblivious to this long tradition of classical Marxists. See Foster and Burkett\n(2016: 2) for a longer list of Marxian ecological economists.\n\n2\n\nPost-Marxism attempted to rescue some useful theoretical legacies of Marx’s\nsocial philosophy, if not his political economy, but such attempts were\nunderstandably accompanied by the resolute rejection of Marxist economic\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 39\n\ndeterminism, resulting in the shift of the theoretical focus from the economic\nbasis to the ‘autonomy of the political’ (Laclau and Mouffe 1985; Rancière\n1998). In this way, post-Marxism contributed to eliminating the problem of\nnature from the agenda of Marxism. This is understandable considering the fact\nthat post-Marxism is a successor to Western Marxism. This problem will be\ndiscussed in the next chapter.\n\n3\n\nAccording to Liedman, this is because Marx ‘imagined that the society that\nwould replace capitalism could also restore the balance between humanity and\nnature in agriculture’. This critique does not make sense, and it makes a\nlarge part of today’s environmental movements non-ecological ‘in the modern\nsense’ as long as they also attempt to ‘restore’ the balance between humans\nand nature. It is not clear what kind of environmental movement can be\nregarded as\n\n‘ecologically conscious’ in light of Liedman’s definition.\n\n4\n\nThere are disputes between the _Monthly Review_ and _Capitalism Nature\nSocialism_.\n\nWhile Foster and Burkett defend the validity of Marx’s own ecological\napproach, Kovel (2007) maintains that Marx himself did not systematically\nelaborate on an ecological critique of capitalism. My own approach is closer\nto Foster and Burkett. However, I also draw inspiration from Japanese Marxists\nsuch as Shigeto Tsuru, Kenichi Miyamoto, Shigeru Iwasa, Tomonaga Tairako and\nRyuji Sasaki.\n\n5\n\nThe focus on Marx’s reception took a different form in Japan, where ecological\neconomics was pioneered by Marxian economists such as Shigeto Tsuru (1976) and\nKenichi Miyamoto (1967) in the 1960s. The discussion of Marx’s reception of\nLiebig’s _Agricultural Chemistry_ was also already present in the 1970s in\nworks by Fumikazu Yoshida, Shigeaki Shiina and Masami Fukutomi. When Foster’s\nwork was translated into Japanese in 2004, his interpretation did not leave a\nstrong impression among Japanese scholars because they were quite familiar\nwith Marx’s engagement with Liebig and its application to environmental\nissues. Consequently, while Foster’s path-breaking formulation of the\n‘metabolic rift’ spread quite effectively outside Japan, Japanese Marxists\nmissed this great opportunity to prevent the decline of their theoretical and\npractical influence after 1991.\n\n6\n\nOne may also wonder why some people so stubbornly refuse to acknowledge Marx’s\necology. There is another reason related to the later reception of Marx’s\ntheory by Engels and by Western Marxism. This issue will be discussed in\nChapter 2.\n\n7\n\nObviously enough, this does not mean that Marx got everything right. I fully\nagree with Engel-Di Mauro’s concern that today’s critique of capitalism cannot\nbe grounded upon the outdated science of the 19th century.\n\n8\n\nFor example, Marx’s notebooks on natural sciences are now available in the\n_MEGA_ IV/18, 26 and 31.\n\n9\n\nOne can think of American economist Kenneth E. Boulding’s famous remark:\n\n‘Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is\neither a madman or an economist’ (US Congress 1973: 248).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n40 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ 10 Among those ecosocialists who pay attention\nto Marx’s concept of metabolism, Mészáros is the one who most adequately\ngrasped the methodological core of Marx’s argument based on Lukács’s\nintellectual heritage, as discussed in Chapter 3. In Japan, Fumikazu Yoshida\n(1980) dealt with Marx’s theory of metabolism in detail.\n\n11 This point becomes more essential in Chapter 4 as those social\nconstructivist advocators of the ‘production of nature’ erase the difference\nbetween ‘first’ and\n\n‘second nature’, which is unable to provide an adequate treatment of the\nhuman–\n\nnature relationship.

(2019).\n\n12 This basic view expressed in _Capital_ is consistent since _The German\nIdeology_ , in which Marx made it clear that this materialist analysis needs\nto start from the problem of ‘labour’ as a unique human act of production: All\nhistorical writing must set out from these natural bases and their\nmodification in the course of history through the action of men.... They\nthemselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin\nto produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their\nphysical organization. ( _MECW_ 5: 31) 13 Mészáros’s method of focusing on the\n‘second-order mediation’ is notably consistent with his earlier analysis of\nMarx’s theory of alienation where he already employed this term. Although he\ndid not use the expression ‘metabolism’ at the time, his characterization of\n‘a historically specific mediation of the ontologically fundamental self-\nmediation of man with nature’ basically expresses the same thing (Mészáros\n1970: 79).\n\n14 It is not easy to distinguish between the first and the secondary\nmediations because these historical aspects of capitalism are ‘inextricably\nintertwined with its transhistorical dimension’ (Mészáros [1972] 2014: 73). It\nis necessary to recall here that Marx’s critique of political economy is a\ncritique of fetishism. It aims to reveal how these second-order mediations of\nhuman metabolism with nature constitute specific social dynamics and deepen\nmultiple crises. Without adequately distinguishing these dimensions, an\nanalysis easily falls into a fetish view to conflate the ‘historical\nnecessity’ of capitalism as a ‘natural necessity’.\n\nThis critique of the fetish will play an important role in Chapter 4, which\ndeals with the recent popularity of monist approaches in political ecology.\n\n15 In Part III of the book, I argue however that there were reasons why Marx\ncould not finish _Capital_. The reason has to do with the rapid deepening of\nhis ecological thinking after 1868.\n\n16 This passage was added by Engels. This is totally understandable\nconsidering the fact that his engagement with the deterioration of the working\nclass in the city in his pioneering work of 1845 is one of his most\nsignificant achievements.\n\n17 Furthermore, Timothy Mitchell (2013) points out that this separation was\neven reinforced by the pipeline of oil in the 20th century. While the\nextraction of coal requires a concentration of workers in the mine, which\nincreases the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Marx’s Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological Crisis_ | 41\n\nrisk of their strong resistance, extraction and transportation of oil\nsignificantly reduce such risk.\n\n18 Marx’s engagement with Jevons will be discussed in Chapter 6.\n\n19 This is what James O’Connor and more recently Jason W. Moore highlight as a\ngrave contradiction of capitalist accumulation. This issue will be discussed\nin detail in Chapter 4.\n\n20 Notably, in the _Grundrisse_ Marx contrasted the ‘real’ and ‘ideal’\ntranscendence of the barriers.\n\nBut from the fact that capital posits every such limit as a barrier and hence\ngets ideally beyond it, it does not by any means follow that it has really\novercome it, and, since every such barrier contradicts its character, its\nproduction moves in contradictions which are constantly overcome but just as\nconstantly posited. ( _Grundrisse_ : 410) Ideal represents the side of\ncapital, while the real the side of the material world. The limit cannot be\novercome in the real world because it is not socially produced. Even if it is\nelastic, it is objectively there.\n\n21 The food system is said to be responsible for one quarter of the world’s\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n\n22 This is the cause of the ‘Netherlands fallacy’, as if technological\ndevelopment alone solves the problem of environmental pollution (Ehrlich and\nEhrlich 1990: 39). The fallacy is a product of ignoring the constant spatial\nexternalization of negative impacts caused by the metabolic rift. At the same\ntime, unequal exchange is characterized by the appropriation of space and\ntime. By importing cotton, it is possible to save local space and times in the\ncentre at the cost of time and space consumed elsewhere. Alf Hornborg (2006)\ncalls this ‘time–\n\nspace appropriation’.\n\n23 Ecologically unequal exchange persists in various forms under today’s\nglobal capitalism. As a solution to climate crisis, solar panel and EVs are\nessential, but the associated battery technology is resource intensive,\nespecially with regard to rare metals. The largest reserve of lithium is found\nin the Andean plateau, so Chile has become the second-largest lithium\nexporter. The Salar de Atacama salt flat is where all the lithium of Chile is\nextracted. Lithium only exists in dry places such as the large salt flats, as\nit is only gradually condensed in brine over a long period. Mining lithium is\nthus conducted by extracting this brine beneath the salt flats of Salar de\nAtacama and by letting the water evaporate so as to allow the further\nconcentration of lithium. In this situation, it is quite obvious that\nexcessive mining of brine makes the area even drier and also degrades the\necosystem. It endangers the Andean flamingo, which eats brine shrimp.\nFurthermore, it causes a lowering of the water table, reducing access to fresh\nwater for Indigenous Antacameño communities (Aronoff et al. 2019: 148–9). The\nsituation is exacerbated by copper mining that also extracts massive\nquantities of fresh water in the Salar. Ironically, the greening of the Global\nNorth is rather strengthening the robbery mining processes of lithium, cobalt,\nnickel and copper in the Global South (Arboleda 2020).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n42 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ 24 However, it is also true that Wallerstein’s\nworld-system theory did not pay sufficient attention to the ecological\ndimension, and Moore (2000) made an important contribution by synthesizing the\nworld ecology into the theory of metabolic rift.\n\n25 This critique does not negate the possibility of finding ecological\nconcerns expressed by Engels, Kautsky and Liebknecht. My point is rather that\nthey did not systematically elaborate on the ecological question with Marx’s\nconcept of metabolism, which is why their texts give an impression of Marx’s\n‘sporadic’\n\ninterests in the issue of environmental destruction.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.002 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n**2**\n\n\n## **The Intellectual Relationship between**\n\n**Marx and Engels Revisited from an**\n\n**Ecological Perspective** *\n\nAs seen in the previous chapter, numerous critics have accused Marx of\n\n‘Prometheanism’, and even self-proclaimed Marxists have concluded that his\nproductivism is incompatible with environmentalism. However, with the\ndeepening ecological crises under neoliberal globalization, the need to\ncritically investigate capitalism’s destructive influence upon the ecosystem\nhas become much more pressing. Having rediscovered Marx’s ecology in this\ncontext, various ecosocialists today employ the concept of ‘metabolic rift’ in\norder to analyse environmental degradation under capitalist production.\nConsequently, ecology has become one of the central fields for enriching the\nlegacy of Marx’s _Capital_ in the 21st century. However, some Marxists still\nrefuse to acknowledge the potentiality of Marx’s ecology, dismissing it as\n‘apocalyptic’\n\n(Harvey 1996: 194). In particular, ‘Western Marxism’ broadly defined is often\ndismissive of Marx’s ecosocialist project as an alternative to capitalism. For\nexample, in an interview published in _Examined Life_ , Slavoj Žižek\nironically reformulates Marx’s famous remark, maintaining that ecology is ‘a\nnew opium for the masses’ (Žižek 2009: 158). Alain Badiou (2008: 139) repeats\nexactly the same judgement.\n\n* This chapter draws on material from ‘Marx and Engels: The Intellectual Relationship Revisited from an Ecological Perspective’, in _Marx’s Capital after 150 Years Critique_ _and Alternative to Capitalism_ , ed.

It is well\nknown that Western Marxism as initiated by Lukács regarded natural science as\nEngels’s domain of expertise, as in Adorno’s comment that Marx’s ‘concept of\n“nature” in which productivity is consummated, also remains underdeveloped, as\ndoes the famous expression\n\n“metabolism with nature”’ (Adorno 1974: 268). Since Western Marxism neglected\nMarx’s extensive research in the natural sciences and marginalized his central\nconcept of ‘metabolism’, it now faces a dilemma in the Anthropocene.\n\nIt cannot develop a Marxist critique of ecological degradation unless it\nadmits its earlier one-sided interpretation of Marx’s social philosophy.\nConsequently, Western Marxists deny the possibility of Marx’s ecology in order\nto defend their own theoretical consistency.\n\nIn contrast to Adorno, Žižek and Badiou, John Bellamy Foster (2000) and Paul\nBurkett (1999) adopted a more fruitful approach to the intellectual\nrelationship between Marx and Engels. They not only pay attention to Marx’s\nengagement with natural science but also effectively employ his methodological\nframework in order to analyse current environmental issues, demonstrating the\nrelevance of Marx’s ecology in today’s world.\n\nFoster and Burkett develop their ecological critique of capitalism by arguing\nthat there exists _no_ significant difference of opinion between Marx and\nEngels on ecology. Burkett argues, for example: As for substantial differences\nbetween Marx and Engels, I believe that this problem has often been\noverestimated – at times gravely so.… In the course of my work, I was _unable\nto find a single significant difference_ in Marx’s and Engels’ respective\nmaterialist and class-relational discussions of natural conditions, and here\nthat is the crucial issue.\n\n(Burkett 1999: 9; emphasis added)\n\nIt is undeniable that Foster and Burkett have quite convincingly shown the\nimportance of Marx’s (and Engels’s) ecology founded on materialism as an\nintegral part of his general critique of political economy and conducted\nmeaningful dialogues with ecological economics in order to highlight the\nunique contribution of Marxian economics to political ecology (Burkett 2006).\nThis great success notwithstanding, there remains the question of whether\ntheoretical differences between Marx and Engels in terms of political economy,\nwhose existence Foster and Burkett do not necessarily deny,1 can also result\nin different views on the issue of ecology.\n\nThis chapter proposes a ‘synthetic’ approach to the earlier literature. By\nfocusing on Marx’s research in natural sciences ignored by Western Marxism, it\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 45\n\naims at revealing the _differences_ in terms of the ecological critique of\ncapitalism between Marx and Engels that Foster and Burkett fail to\nacknowledge.\n\nPresupposing their obvious collaborations and common understandings, this\nchapter analyses _Capital_ in relation to new materials published in the\n_Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe,_ which were not considered in the earlier\nliterature.2 Section I will reveal the existence of a backstory behind the\nintellectual division of labour between Marx and Engels. By doing so, it\nbecomes clear that both Marx and Engels had a strong interest in natural\nscience, but for very different reasons. This is clear from Engels’s critique\nof Liebig’s theory of metabolism, which prevented him from fully appreciating\nMarx’s own rapid methodological development in the 1860s that pivots around\nLiebig’s concept of ‘metabolism’ (II). Consequently, Engels helped make Marx’s\necology invisible by criticizing Liebig’s concept of ‘metabolism’\n\n(III). Seen from a genealogical perspective, Engels also contributed to\nmarginalizing Marx’s theory of metabolism through his influential project on\nthe dialectics of nature. However, it is this suppressed method of Marx’s\npolitical economy that indicates the theoretical direction for developing his\nunfinished project of _Capital_ in the Anthropocene (IV).\n\n\n## **i**\n\n**iNtellectual divisioN of labour?**\n\nAs seen in the previous chapter, Marx’s ecology was ignored for quite a long\ntime. One reason for neglecting Marx’s legacy of ecology was the unfinished\ncharacter of Marx’s _Capital_. Until the recent publication of manuscripts and\nnotebooks in the _Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe_ , even scholars did not know of\ntheir existence, and they simply remained covered in dust in the two archives,\nthe Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) in Moscow and\nthe International Institute of Social History (IISG) in Amsterdam.\n\nYet there is another factor within the Marxist tradition that contributed to\nmarginalizing Marx’s ecological critique of capitalism in the 20th century.\nThe reason for this neglect is that ‘traditional Marxism’ treated Marx’s\nhistorical materialism as a closed dialectical system that would enable the\nworking class to comprehend the truth of the universe, encompassing both human\nhistory and nature. The establishment of such a gigantic ideological apparatus\nwas necessary for the mass mobilization of workers for Marxism against other\nsocialist rivals such as Eugen Dühring and Ferdinand Lassalle. In other words,\ntraditional Marxists likewise attempted to provide a proletarian\n\n‘worldview’ ( _Weltanschauung_) as a tool for the identification and\nmobilization https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n46 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ of the socialist movement (Heinrich 2012:\n24–5). However, such an attempt inevitably distorted Marx’s original project\nin various ways.3\n\nTraditional Marxists did not pay enough attention to Marx’s economic\nmanuscripts and even less to his notebooks because otherwise they were afraid\nto admit that these materials document the incomplete character of _Capital_.\n\nInstead, they simply focused on Engels’s edition of _Capital_ as the\ntheoretical foundation of Marx’s system of political economy that discloses\nexploitation of the working class and demonstrates the necessity of economic\ncrisis as well as the inevitability of socialist revolution. Even though\ntraditional Marxists admitted that Marx had almost nothing to say about the\nontological status of nature in his published writings, they simply took\nrecourse to Engels’s _Dialectics of Nature_ and _Anti-Dühring_ in order to\nexpand their materialist theory to the entire universe. The difference between\nMarx and Engels is erased in this assumption about their intellectual\ncollaboration.\n\nThere are, however, obvious problems here. Traditional Marxists cannot deny\nthat Marx did not produce any systematic account of the dialectics of nature.\nThe universal system of Marx’s dialectical materialism does not exist in\nMarx’s original writings. Such a system must be carefully reconstructed by\nediting manuscripts, adding annotations to Marx’s texts and even _omitting_\nwhat is inconvenient. They carefully chose what to publish and what not to\nbecause they were afraid that these unpublished writings might reveal the\nincomplete character of Marx’s system or reveal new aspects that were not\ncompatible with their own worldview.4 What was incompatible was marginalized\nor even suppressed. However, Marx’s economic manuscripts for _Capital_ were\nfinally fully published in 2012 in the _MEGA_.5 Based on the _MEGA_ , this\nchapter demonstrates the importance of the manuscripts and notebooks,\nespecially Marx’s notebooks on natural science.\n\nEngels played an important role in this story as the founder of ‘traditional\nMarxism’ because he established Marxism as a worldview for the social and\npolitical movement of the working class. He highlighted the systematic and\ncomplete character of Marx’s _Capital_ as well as its superiority over Eugen\nDühring’s influential work in order to win hegemony within the Social\nDemocratic Party during the period of Otto von Bismarck’s antisocialist laws\n(Adamiak 1974).6 It is well known that Engels edited Marx’s manuscripts and\npublished them as volumes II and III of _Capital_. He also republished various\nbooks, pamphlets and articles of Marx after his death. In doing so, he often\nadded new prefaces and introductions, sometimes even adding and modifying\noriginal texts written by Marx. As Terrell Carver (1983: 119) points out, it\nwas not Marx’s _Capital_ but Engels’s _Socialism: Utopian and_ _Scientific_\nthat was the most read book on Marxism. It is no exaggeration to say that ‘it\nwas Engels who established the central tradition’ (Lichtheim 1961:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 47\n\n235) and largely determined the course of Marxism in the 20th century. The\nleaders of the Second International as well as those who led the first\nsuccessful seizure of the state power in the Russian Revolution were heavily\ninfluenced by Engels’s views on history, the state and revolution. What these\n‘traditional Marxists’ thought of as ‘what everyone knows to be true about\nMarx’ was actually nothing but ‘a construct of the elderly Engels’ (Carver\n1983: 153).\n\nDespite the persistent claim in Marxism-Leninism that scientific socialism was\na collaborative project of Marx and Engels and that Marx ‘entirely shared\nEngels’ conceptions’ (Anguélov 1980: 132), Carver and supporters of his view\ndeterminedly reject the omnipotent worldview of traditional Marxist\ndialectical materialism (Paul Thomas 1976), even portraying their relationship\nas ‘Marx contra Engels’; Marxists were deceived by ‘Engelsism’, which they\nultimately hold responsible for the terror of Stalinism (Levine 1975: 241).\n\nThe most prominent example of stressing the difference between Marx and Engels\nis ‘Western Marxism’. The category was originally employed by Maurice Merleau\n(1973: 59),7 but its foundation goes back to the 1920s, in particular Lukács\nGyörgy’s _History and Class Consciousness_.8 Although Western Marxism is a\nbroad category that encompasses great heterogeneity among those who are\nlabelled as such, one of the key topics is this anti-Stalinist attempt to\nprovide a more sophisticated _theory of society_ without falling into a\nmechanistic worldview (Jacoby 1983: 583). Western Marxism, in a sense,\nattempted to save Marx’s social philosophy by criticizing Engels’s dialectics\nof nature and strictly limiting dialectics to society. In challenging the\nvalidity of traditional Marxism in reaction to Nikita Khrushchev’s secret\nspeech as well as the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956, Western Marxists\ndrew upon Hegel in order to counter the ‘dialectical materialism’ of Soviet\nMarxism. In this context, Western Marxism targeted Engels as the misleading\nfounder of this problematic worldview based on economic determinism and\nscientism. If Engels were right about the independent and objective existence\nof dialectics in nature, it would be possible to conceptualize and formulate a\ndialectical method first through the investigations in natural science and\nthen to apply it to the analysis of human society. However, such a procedure\nproduces a mechanistic and positivist understanding of society that is\nincompatible with Marx’s dialectical analysis of capitalism. Western Marxism\nthus regarded the realm of natural science as Engels’s domain of expertise and\ncompletely separated it from Marx’s dialectical philosophy of society.\n\nThis separation inevitably resulted in ‘a basic shift in the whole centre of\ngravity of European Marxism towards philosophy’ (P. Anderson 1976: 49).\n\nFor example, Louis Althusser (2001: 35) criticized Engels’s ‘positivist theme’\n\nthat erases philosophy. In his attempt to revive Marx’s dialectic, Jean-Paul\nSartre also denounced Engels’s materialism as absurdity: ‘I have always\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n48 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ thought that such a fertile working hypothesis\nas historical materialism in no way required as a basis the absurdity of\nmetaphysical materialism’\n\n(Sartre 2004: 51). Highlighting the intellectual division of labour between\nMarx and Engels, Lucio Colletti (1973: 132) even concluded that the views of\nMarx and Engels are characterized by ‘two profoundly different ways of seeing\nthings’. The central problem was the relationship between nature and\ndialectics. Alfred Schmidt in his treatment of Marx’s concept of nature\ndoubted ‘whether dialectical determinations such as “totality”,\n“contradiction”,\n\n“productivity”, “immanent negation” could in any sense be ascribed to nature’\n\nwithout falling into ‘dogmatic metaphysics’ (Schmidt [1971] 2014: 183–4, 51).\n\nIn this manner, Western Marxists expelled Engels and his mechanistic dialectic\nof nature from their analysis, but at the same time they completely excluded\nthe sphere of nature and natural science from Marx’s social philosophy.\n\nThis decision was inevitable for Western Marxists in order to prevent Marx’s\nsocial theory from descending into the crude materialism of Soviet Marxism,\nbut in a sense, the ‘divergence thesis’ was ‘motivated more by ideology than\nby evidence’ (Blackledge 2020: 29). In fact, the price paid by Western Marxism\nwas high. It became unable to integrate the problem of ecology into its\nanalysis because it is the sphere where nature must play a central role. As a\nresult, its heavily philosophical approach is unable to effectively respond to\nthe ecological crisis in the Anthropocene.9\n\nThis is how both traditional Marxism and Western Marxism ended up neglecting\nthe importance of Marx’s serious research in the field of natural sciences\nthroughout the 20th century. However, like Foster and Burkett, there are other\nclassical Marxists who recognize Marx’s strong interest in natural science and\nargue for the unity of Marx and Engels without falling into a positivist\nworldview.10 They pointed out the following facts: Marx wrote a whole chapter\nof _Anti-Dühring_ and revised Engels’s manuscript, calling it ‘very important’\n(Welty 1983: 183; _MECW_ 45: 334); Marx himself used the term ‘scientific\nsocialism’ (Stanley 2002: 43); and most decisively, Marx shared with Engels\nthe dialectic of nature when he wrote in _Capital_ about the transformation of\nquantity to quality (Foster 2020: 241). Thus, these Marxists conclude: ‘To\nmaintain anything more than that, however, makes Engels the scapegoat for\nScientific Marxism; to differentiate him radically from Marx is … historically\ndubious and unjust’ (Gouldner 1980: 251). Kaan Kangal (2020: 15, 185) argues\nthat the existence of ‘difference’ that is natural for any collaborative\nproject does not immediately mean ‘break’, concluding that Marx and Engels\n‘have a common worldview’.\n\nWestern Marxism, despite its claim to the authentic interpretation of Marx’s\nphilosophy, falls into nonsense when it denies his interest in natural\nscience. Marx, following Hegel, described some natural phenomena as\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 49\n\nmanifestations of an objective dialectic of nature. This is just one example\nof the many things upon which Marx and Engels agreed. To deny this fact would\nbe absurd. Nevertheless, this does not immediately mean that they had pursued\nthe same single project based upon a division of labour. Since they are\nultimately two different people with different interests, it is natural to\nassume that there were important differences of opinion even if they shared\nmany ideas. While it is unfair to scapegoat Engels ‘as a convenient whipping\nboy’ (Foster 2017: 48), one should not erase theoretical differences between\nMarx and Engels. Just as Marx’s understanding of political economy cannot be\nequated with Engels’s despite their long-standing collaboration (Otani 2016),\nthe possibility of disagreement always remains, even when they simultaneously\nstudied the same topic and _even when they believed that they_ _shared the\nsame interests_. In this context, the _MEGA_ provides new materials with which\nto more rigorously re-examine their intellectual relationship and division of\nlabour.\n\nIronically, it was Engels himself who emphasized this intellectual division of\nlabour with Marx, giving credibility to the claim made by Western Marxism.\n\nAccording to his preface to the second edition of _Anti-Dühring_ published\nafter Marx’s death, ‘Marx was well versed in mathematics, but we could keep up\nwith natural science only piecemeal, intermittently and sporadically’.\n\nLater, however, Engels reflected on this blind spot: ‘When I retired from\nbusiness and transferred my home to London, thus enabling myself to give the\nnecessary time to it, I went through as complete as possible a “moulting”, as\nLiebig calls it, in mathematics and the natural sciences’ ( _MECW_ 25: 11). In\nfact, _Anti-Dühring_ and _Dialectics of Nature_ document Engels’s serious\nstudy of developments in physics, chemistry and biology in his time.\nConsequently, his works greatly influenced the formation of the worldview of\ntraditional Marxism. Because of Engels’s authority as Marx’s closest comrade,\nsubsequent generations of Marxists could simply take for granted the existence\nof an intellectual division of labour between the two. This assumption makes\nit appear as if Marx did not have much to say about nature precisely because\nhe had entrusted Engels with the further development of the dialectics of\nnature.\n\nThus, Engels’s _Dialectics of Nature_ and _Anti-Dühring_ became the key\nreference points in applying Marx’s dialectical materialism to the sphere of\nnature. This was how ‘Marxism’ was ‘invented’ by Engels.\n\nHowever, Engels in his preface to the second edition of _Anti-Dühring_ (1885)\nhid some important information from his readers. At the time, this editor of\n_Capital_ was occupied with sorting out Marx’s manuscripts and notebooks, so\nhe must have known that Marx also eagerly studied natural sciences, especially\nin his later years while writing the manuscripts of _Capital_. In fact, Marx\nand Engels often discussed various issues in natural sciences. Some\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n50 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ of their close friends were experts in natural\nscience, such as Carl Schorlemmer, Samuel Moore and Roland Daniels, and they\nalso gave Marx and Engels intellectual stimulation to study chemistry,\nphysiology and biology, forming a scientific community (Griese and Pawelzig\n1995). However, Engels did not mention this fact and simply said that Marx\n‘only piecemeal, intermittently and sporadically’ followed the rapid\ndevelopment of natural sciences.\n\nWhile Marx and Engels surely shared an interest in natural science, Engels was\nmore advanced in his research into natural science at first. Indeed, Marx in\nhis letter to Engels dated 4 July 1864 wrote that he was inspired by Engels to\nread Carpenter’s _Physiology_ as well as Spurzheim’s _Anatomy of the_ _Brain\nand the Nervous System_ and wrote: ‘I invariably follow in your footsteps’\n\n( _MECW_ 41: 546). However, after reading the seventh edition of Justus von\nLiebig’s _Agricultural Chemistry_ in 1865, Marx started to study natural\nsciences quite intensively (Foster 2000; Saito 2017). His reading list after\n1868\n\nexpanded rapidly and came to include various fields of natural science such as\nchemistry, geology, mineralogy, physiology and botany. He rapidly caught up\nwith Engels, though the latter also kept studying these topics. Loyal to his\nold habit of studying new materials, Marx, especially in his last years, left\na large number of notebooks on natural science. In the last 15 years of his\nlife, he filled one-third of his notebooks, half of which comprise excerpts\nfrom books on natural sciences.\n\nOn 19 December 1882, Engels acknowledged that Marx was more familiar with what\ncan be considered today as the problem of increasing entropy with the\nconsumption of fossil fuel:\n\n[The] working individual is not only a stabiliser _of present_ but also, and\nto a far greater extent, a squanderer _of past_ , solar heat. As to what we\nhave done in the way of squandering our reserves of energy, our coal, ore,\nforests, etc., _you are better informed than I am_. ( _MECW_ 46: 411; emphasis\nadded)\n\nEngels’s remark indicates how much Marx’s ecological interest developed after\n1865. Marx dealt directly with the ‘squandering’ of natural recourses by\ngrounding his insights in geology and mineralogy ( _MEGA_ IV/31). Marx\ncarefully read books by geologists such as James F. W. Johnston and Joseph\nBeete Jukes, but he also read newspapers and articles related to economy and\necology. He paid attention to the mechanization of coal mining, whose impact\non workers as well as the environment must be carefully studied. In his letter\nto Jenny dated on 6 June 1881, Marx referred to the newly invented\n\n‘coal-cutting machine’ in the United States and paid attention to how it would\naffect to the miners as well as threaten ‘John Bull’s industrial supremacy (\n_MECW_ 46: 96). Even knowing all this, Engels did _not_ mention this point in\nthe preface to _Anti-Dühring_ and instead simply claimed that his dialectics\nof https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 51\n\nnature was an application of the dialectical method ‘founded and developed’\n\nby Marx ( _MECW_ 25: 9).\n\nThis is strange. Engels in the same preface emphatically maintained that the\nideas developed in _Anti-Dühring_ were fully compatible with Marx’s, saying\nthat he ‘read the whole manuscript to him before it was printed’\n\n( _MECW_ 25: 9), and Marx fully agreed with him. However, Engels’ remark is\nnot necessarily credible because this ‘proof ’ was provided only _after_\nMarx’s death (Carver 1983: 123). Moreover, Engels did not refer to Marx’s\nserious engagement with natural science. This silence is quite remarkable\nbecause the existence of Marx’s notebooks on natural sciences would provide\neven stronger ‘evidence’ for the dialectics of nature as their collaborative\nproject was supported by Marx himself. Since Marx’s notebooks had not been\npublished at the time, Engels could have simply said that, inspired by his\ngreat theoretical endeavour, Marx was also greatly interested in investigating\nthe dialectics of nature. But he did not mention the existence of these\nnotebooks, so that they remained unpublished throughout the 20th century. Here\none is tempted to symptomatically interpret Engels’s unnatural silence: _he\ntacitly admitted_ _that Marx’s interest in natural sciences possessed a\ndifferent character to his own_.\n\nConsequently, the honest Engels (unconsciously) avoided referring to Marx’s\nserious engagement with natural science and instead simply emphasized their\nintellectual division of labour. If this is the case, what is the underlying\ndifference between them?\n\n\n## **ii**\n\n**Marx as author aNd eNgels as editor of _Capital_**\n\nSince the publication of Marx’s notebooks in the _MEGA_ revealed that _both_\nMarx and Engels had studied natural science, Western Marxism’s one-sided\ndelimiting of the theoretical scope of Marx’s dialectical analysis to the\nsphere of society is flawed. It is no longer credible to maintain that Marx’s\ncritique of political economy must be restricted to the analysis of society\nbecause he actively expanded it to analyse how the metabolic exchange between\nhumans _and_ nature is transformed and reorganized in favour of capital\naccumulation.\n\nIn this sense, it is not possible to completely separate Marx and Engels.\n\nNevertheless, this does not immediately mean that Marx and Engels shared the\n_same_ interest in their research in natural science.11 One needs to\ninvestigate the issue more carefully.12\n\nThe unfortunate problem is that, despite his serious engagement with natural\nsciences, Marx passed away in 1883 before completing _Capital_. Engels had to\ntake up the task of editing volumes II and III of _Capital_. His effort\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n52 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ was enormous, considering the fact that Marx\nleft only a series of unfinished and fragmentary manuscripts, which were not\nat all suitable for publication in their original form. Volume II consists of\neight manuscripts written between 1864 and 1881, which means that these\nmanuscripts are not at the same level of theoretical maturity. The main body\nof the manuscript for volume III of _Capital_ was written in 1864/65 (before\nthe publication of volume I in 1867), so Marx was not able to integrate his\nlater developments into the manuscript except for some fragmentary\ncalculations on the rate of surplus value and profit ( _MEGA_ II/4.3 and\nII/14; Heinrich 2016).\n\nOf course, Engels did his best, but it was impossible for Engels to perfectly\nunderstand Marx’s intentions and objectives and to reflect them in his edition\nof _Capital_. As a result, differences inevitably emerged between Marx as the\nauthor and Engels as the editor of _Capital_ (Roth 2002). According to\nTeinosuke Otani (2016), the first cause for misinterpretation of Marx’s true\nintention in the manuscript was that the older Engels dictated the manuscript\naloud to Oscar Eisengarten, who transcribed it. Engels used this transcribed\ntext as the basis for his editorial work ( _MEGA_ II/12). Consequently, Engels\noverlooked the distinction Marx made in his manuscript as well as various\nmark-ups in it. Marx divided his manuscript into two parts, one for the main\ntext of volume III and the other written as notes on relevant materials to be\nused mainly as footnotes. However, Engels mistakenly treated the latter as\npart of the main text too, so that the logical line of Marx’s argument in the\nmanuscript became partially invisible in the Engels edition. This would not\nhave happened if Engels had directly looked at the original manuscript during\nhis editorial work.\n\nThe second reason for misappropriation is that the only information available\nto Engels about chapter 5 of volume III13 came from Marx’s sporadic remarks in\nhis private letters, so Engels inevitably had a strong prejudice about the\nobject of Marx’s analysis and its characteristics in chapter 5. Directly\nlooking at the original manuscript ( _MEGA_ II/4.2), it is clear that the\ntheme that chapter 5 as a whole deals with is interest-bearing capital, but\nEngels believed that the object of this chapter must be ‘bank’ and ‘credit’.\n\nAs a result, he made changes even in Marx’s texts in order to reconcile the\ncontent of chapter 5 with his own understanding. Due to Engels’s bias, the\ntrue shape of chapter 5 in Marx’s manuscript became invisible in part 5 of the\nEngels edition.\n\nConsidering these differences in their respective understandings of political\neconomy, there were probably noticeable differences in their ecology as well.\nIn fact, when Engels neglected Marx’s notebooks on natural sciences in the\npreface to _Anti-Dühring_ , there existed a subtle disagreement between Marx\nand Engels concerning the concept of ‘metabolism’. This problem is discernible\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 53\n\nin Engels’s edition of volume III of _Capital_ , in which Marx drew upon\nLiebig’s critique of robbery agriculture in order to demonstrate the\nirrationality of capitalist production. Certainly, Engels recognized the\nimportance of Liebig’s critique of robbery agriculture as a foundation of\nMarx’s ecological critique of capitalism. For example, in _The Housing\nQuestion_ , he like Marx referred to Liebig, pointing to the ‘antithesis of\ntown and country’. He also argued for the reconstruction of ‘an intimate\nconnection between industrial and agricultural production’ ( _MECW_ 23: 384).\nThis is basically a continuation of what Marx and Engels demanded as the\n‘combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries’ in the _Manifesto\nof the Communist Party_ ( _MECW_ 6: 505). Also, in editing _Capital_ , volume\nIII, Engels supplemented Marx’s description of robbery agriculture with\nconcrete examples. He added the following passage, for example, in order to\nhighlight Marx’s intention of criticizing the wasteful loss of soil nutrients\nthrough the use of water-closets in large cities more clearly: ‘In London, for\nexample, they can do nothing better with the excrement produced by 4½ million\npeople than pollute the Thames with it, at monstrous expense’ ( _Capital_ III:\n195). Here one can observe the intellectual _collaboration_ between Marx and\nEngels based on Liebig’s ‘law of replenishment’.\n\nHowever, things look rather different when the concept of ‘metabolism’ is at\nstake. Engels must have been aware that Marx discussed the problem of soil\nexhaustion with Liebig’s theory of metabolism and its disruption due to the\nrobbery system of modern agriculture. The hint is that Engels intentionally\nchanged a particular passage related to the concept of metabolism in volume\nIII of _Capital_. In his original manuscript, Marx wrote:\n\n[In] this way [large-scale landownership] produces conditions that provoke an\nirreparable rift in the interdependent process between social metabolism and\nnatural metabolism prescribed by the natural laws of the soil. The result of\nthis is a squandering of the vitality of the soil, and trade carries this\ndevastation far beyond the bounds of a single country (Liebig). ( _MEGA_\nII/4.2: 752–3)\n\nReferring to Liebig, Marx highlighted the danger of a serious global\ndisruption to the interdependent process between ‘social metabolism’\n(capitalist production, circulation and consumption for the sake of profit)\nand the ‘natural metabolism’ prescribed by natural law (plant growth and soil\necology). This is the problem of the second-order mediation of the universal\nmetabolism of nature that exists independently of human beings. The unique set\nof capital’s metabolic organization aiming at its own infinite valorization\nwith an ever-expanding scale is incompatible with the natural laws that exist\nprior to capital. The problem is aggravated by international trade because it\nincreases the difficulty of fulfilling Liebig’s law of replenishment. In this\npassage, Marx https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n54 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ clearly formulated the tense relationship\nbetween the capitalist economic form determinations ( _Formbestimmungen_) and\nthe natural properties of the material world. This passage undoubtedly plays a\ncentral role in the conceptual and methodological framework of the metabolic\nrift approach (Foster 2000).\n\nHowever, Engels modified the first sentence in his edition of volume III of\n_Capital_ as follows: ‘… in this way it produces conditions that provoke an\nirreparable rift in the interdependent process of social metabolism, a\nmetabolism prescribed by the natural laws of life itself ’ ( _Capital_ III:\n949). Now the word\n\n‘natural metabolism’ is omitted and ‘soil’ is changed to ‘life’.14 The\nomission of the term ‘natural metabolism’ is regrettable because the contrast\nbetween social and natural metabolism, which is key to Marx’s method of\ndistinguishing between the primary and the second-order mediation of\nmetabolism, became obscure.15 In this sense, the claim that ‘Engels’ and\nMarx’s conceptions of the method of political economy are in accord’ (Welty\n1983: 294) needs to be questioned. Rather, this passage seems to imply a\nprofound methodological difference between them. Certainly, there are a number\nof cases where Engels had to modify Marx’s expressions whenever unclear,\nconfusing or mistaken.\n\nHowever, in this passage, Marx’s intention is not only clear but also this is\na key passage for his theory of metabolic rift. What does Engels’s editorial\nchange signify?\n\nHere it is first helpful to briefly overview Engels’s ‘dialectics of nature’.\n\nAccording to him, _Anti-Dühring_ was written with the intention of grasping\nthe laws of nature and history and especially to ‘strip [them] of this\n[Hegelian]\n\nmystic form and to bring clearly before the mind in their complete simplicity\nand universality’. In contrast to Hegel’s idealist objective dialectics,\nEngels claimed his dialectics of nature to be a _materialist_ one that avoided\nHegel’s misconception of ‘building the law of dialectics into nature’. For\nhim, ‘there could be no question of building the laws of dialectics into\nnature, but of discovering them in it and evolving them from it’ ( _MECW_ 25:\n11–13). In other words, his project sought to grasp the real laws of\ndevelopment of nature as they exist in nature ‘objectively and independent’ of\nhuman existence and activities (McLellan 1977: 73). It is an ontological\ninvestigation in that it dialectically develops movements, metamorphosis and\nevolution in nature through history (Jordan 1967: 167). Nevertheless, this\nontological turn has become quite unpopular among those Marxists who wish to\ndistinguish Marx’s critique of political economy from Engels’s scientism.\n\nCarver (1983: 107) argues that Engels’s investigation, unlike Marx’s, reflects\nthe ontological dichotomy of ‘matter’ and ‘consciousness’ found in modern\nnatural science. Similarly, Shlomo Avineri maintained that ‘Engels’s\nmaterialism, based on the mechanistic traditions of the eighteenth century,\ndiffered markedly from the main stream of Marx’s thought’ (Avineri 1970: 4).16\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 55\n\nAlthough the laws of nature exist objectively, their comprehension has a great\npractical purpose for human beings.17 In other words, Engels’s dialectics of\nnature is tied to a practical demand for the realization of ‘freedom’ through\nthe ‘mastery’ and ‘control’ of external nature. Accordingly, the construction\nof socialism as a free society means for Engels to become the ‘real, conscious\nlord of nature’, as he insisted:\n\nThe extraneous objective forces that have hitherto governed history pass under\nthe control of man himself. Only from that time will man himself, with full\nconsciousness, make his own history ‒ only from that time will the social\ncauses set in movement by him have, in the main and in a constantly growing\nmeasure, the results intended by him. It is the humanity’s leap from the realm\nof necessity to the realm of freedom.\n\n( _MECW_ 25: 270)\n\nHe also wrote in _Dialectics of Nature_ that our mastery of [nature] consists\nin the fact that we have the advantage over other being of being able to know\nand apply its laws. And in fact, with every day that passes we are learning to\nunderstand its laws more correctly … we are more and more placed in a position\nwhere we can learn and even control the more remote natural consequences of\nour ordinary productive activities. ( _MECW_ 25: 461) According to Engels, not\nonly by abolishing the reified domination of capital independently of human\nconsciousness and behaviour but also by fully appropriating the objective laws\nof nature can humans finally leap to ‘the realm of freedom’.\n\nOf course, Engels did not think that the recognition of the laws of nature\nwould allow humans to arbitrarily manipulate nature. He was not naively\nadvocating for the absolute domination over nature by maximizing the\nproductive forces. In _Dialectics of Nature_ , he even warned against the\n‘revenge’\n\nof nature:\n\nLet us not, however, flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human\nvictories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us.\nEach victory, it is true, in the first place brings about the results we\nexpected, but in the second and third places it has quite different,\nunforeseen effects which only too often cancel out the first…. Thus at every\nstep we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror\nover a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature –\n\nbut that we, with flesh, blood, and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its\nmidst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact that we have the\nadvantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply\nthem correctly. ( _MECW_ 25: 460–1)\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n56 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ This remark has often been cited as proof of\nEngels’s ecological interest hidden in his otherwise highly abstract\n_Dialectics of Nature_ (Salleh, Goodman and Hamed 2015: 102). He was\nparticularly critical of capitalist production oriented towards short-term\nprofit maximization that refuses to recognize natural limits: ‘As the\nindividual capitalists are engaged in production and exchange for the sake of\nthe immediate profit, only the nearest, most immediate results must first be\ntaken into account’ ( _MECW_ 25: 463). If the laws of nature are continuously\nignored, the project of dominating nature inevitably fails, which culminates\nin catastrophe: humans cease to be active, labouring agents but are obliged to\nbehave passively at the mercy of nature’s power, leading to the collapse of\ncivilization. Thus, Foster concludes: ‘ _For Engels, as for Marx,_ _the key to\nsocialism was the rational regulation of the metabolism of humanity_ _and\nnature_ , in such a way as to promote the fullest possible human potential,\nwhile safeguarding the needs of future generations’ (Foster 2017: 50; emphasis\nadded). Is this really so?\n\nEngels was certainly an ecosocialist. Foster is right in this point. However,\nwhile Marx clearly demanded that ‘the associated producers’ ‘govern the human\nmetabolism with nature in a rational way’ ( _Capital_ III: 959), Engels did\n_not_ use the term ‘metabolism’ in demanding an ecosocialist future. Engels’s\necology pivoted around nature’s ‘revenge’, criticizing short-sighted profit\nmaximization under capitalism. The key passage on ‘metabolic rift’ in\n_Capital_ was also modified by Engels in accordance with this scheme of\nnature’s revenge. Engels’s edition of _Capital_ emphasizes that the violation\nof natural laws of life would bring about a fatal consequence for human\ncivilization, while the methodological approach unique to Marx’s metabolic\ntheory, which investigates how the law of value dominant in the social\nmetabolism modifies the natural metabolism and causes an irreparable rift, has\nbecome rather unclear. Engels judged that readers would find Marx’s original\nexpression about the entanglement between economic form determinations – the\n‘second order mediation’ – and the universal metabolism of nature hard to\nunderstand and changed the sentence into a more ‘accessible’ expression in\naccordance with his scheme of nature’s revenge.18\n\nEngels’s modification of _Capital_ may appear to be a subtle one. However, the\nsignificance of his editorial change becomes apparent when we notice the fact\nthat, unlike Marx, he did _not_ cherish Liebig’s theory of metabolism.\n\nIndeed, in _Dialectics of Nature_ he referred to Liebig’s concept of\nmetabolism _in_ _the context of criticizing_ him as a ‘dilettante’ in biology\n( _MECW_ 25: 576). This expression clearly indicates that Engels was not\nentirely supportive of Liebig’s view, except for his theory of robbery\nagriculture. Engels’s dismissal of Liebig’s theory of metabolism has to do\nwith their different opinions concerning the origin of life. Liebig (wrongly)\ndenied the possibility of the historical\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 57\n\nevolution of organic life from inorganic matter and accepted the hypothesis\nthat ‘eternal life’ had been ‘imported’ to the planet from universal space\n(Liebig 1859: 291). Here it is possible to discern the influence of 19th-\ncentury vitalism that believed in certain inexplicable forces of life\n(Wendling 2009: 81).\n\nIn opposition to this vitalist tradition, Engels correctly argued that life is\nthe process of metabolism that historically emerged and evolved from inorganic\nnon-life. ‘Protein’ confirms this point: ‘Life is the mode of existence of\nprotein bodies, the essential element of which consists in _continual\nmetabolic interchange_ _with the natural environment outside them_ ’ ( _MECW_\n25: 578; emphasis added).\n\nEngels saw the origin of life in the chemical process of assimilation and\nexcretion of protein bodies, and he pointed to the possibility of artificially\ncreating a living organism by generating protein in a laboratory.19\n\nEngels rejected Liebig’s vitalism, with its separation of biology from\nchemistry and its inexplicable principles that are supposedly unique to living\nbeings. According to Engels, inorganic bodies have metabolism as a chemical\ninterchange with their environment, and once ‘protein’ historically evolved,\nmetabolism came to exist as life. In this evolutionary process, there is no\nabsolute rift between inorganic (inanimate) and organic (living) matters. Here\nEngels’s concept of metabolism attains a unique theoretical importance in\n_Dialectics of Nature_ to bridge chemistry and biology.\n\nSince Engels’s concept of metabolism emphasized the historical emergence of\nprotein in opposition to Liebig, his ecology did not apply the concept of\nmetabolism to environmental issues as Marx and Liebig had done. In doing so,\nhowever, he lost sight of the methodological role of Liebig’s theory of\nmetabolism in Marx’s _Capital_ as a way to analyse the relationality of humans\nand nature from both a transhistorical and socio-historical perspective and to\nreveal the particular contradictions of capital’s second-order mediation.\n\nEngels limited the theoretical scope of metabolism to the process of the\norigin and evolution of life that proceeded _independently of_ human beings\nand their social relations unfolded as the dialectics of nature. According to\nEngels’s _Anti-Dühring_ , the motor of dialectics characterized by ‘negation\nof negation’\n\nis ‘a law which … holds good in the animal and plant kingdoms, in geology, in\nmathematics, in history and in philosophy’ ( _MECW_ 25: 131). The main role he\nassigns to ‘metabolism’ is not as an ecological analysis of capitalism but as\na demonstration that this objective law penetrates the whole of nature\nencompassing both inorganic and organic beings.20\n\nConsequently, although Engels partially took up Liebig’s views, he did not\nadopt the concept of metabolic rift in _Capital_ but rather maintained the\nearlier scheme of the ‘antagonism of town and country’ already put forward in\n_The German Ideology_.21 Here his personal interest in the dialectics of\nnature hindered his appreciation of the economic meaning of Marx’s reception\nof https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n58 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Liebig’s theory of metabolism. In other words,\nEngels’s modification implies that he could not entirely grasp the\nmethodological foundation of Marx’s critique of political economy that he\ndeveloped in the 1850s and 1860s, which deals with how the metabolism between\nhumans and nature is modified and reorganized through the formal and real\nsubsumption of labour under capital.\n\nThis is exactly how the differences between Marx and Engels in relation to\npolitical economy affects the sphere of ecology.\n\nCertainly, Marx did not abandon his earlier insight about the ‘antithesis of\ntown and country’ even in _Capital_ , where he wrote:\n\n… the foundation of every division of labour which has attained a certain\ndegree of development, and has been brought about by the exchange of\ncommodities, is the separation of town from country. One might well say that\nthe whole economic history of society is summed up in the movement of this\nantithesis. ( _Capital_ I: 472) This antagonism between town and country can\nbe fruitfully reinterpreted as the antagonism between ‘centre’ and ‘periphery’\nto analyse modern ecological imperialism in an ecological critique of\ncapitalism (Clark and Foster 2009).22\n\nHowever, this should not relativize the theoretical significance of the fact\nthat Marx started analysing the disturbance of metabolism between humans and\nthe earth in accordance with his own method of political economy because this\ndifference of method influences Marx’s and Engels’s visions of the future\nsociety.\n\n\n## **iii**\n\n**dialectics of ‘doMiNatioN’ aNd ‘reveNge’**\n\nBoth Marx and Engels regarded the conscious and teleological control of\nnatural laws through labour as a unique human activity, which they often\ncharacterized as ‘control’ over nature. For example, Engels wrote in _Anti-\nDühring_ : ‘Freedom therefore consists in the control over ourselves and over\nexternal nature, a control founded on knowledge of natural necessity’\n\n( _MECW_ 25: 106). Such remarks are often taken by critics as a manifestation\nof his ‘Baconian-Prometheanism’ belief (Peter Thomas 2008: 42). A counterproof\nagainst such a criticism is Engels’s warning against nature’s ‘revenge’.\nEngels held the necessity of correctly recognizing the laws of nature and\napplying them properly without necessarily advocating for the arbitrary\nmanipulation of nature.\n\nHowever, more recent criticisms have been directed against Marxism. For\nexample, Jason W. Moore argues that Engels is too ‘static’ in arguing that if\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 59\n\nthe law of nature continues to be ignored, nature will take revenge on humans\n_one day_(Moore 2015: 80). Neil Smith similarly rejected the revenge of nature\nas ‘left apocalypticism’ (N. Smith [1984] 2008: 247). In responding to Moore\nand Smith, one should note that Marx did not treat the disruption of the\nuniversal metabolism of nature under capitalism merely as revenge by nature\nbut analysed the problem of metabolic rift from two more aspects. First, Marx\nrepeatedly highlighted that capital does not simply accept the limits nature\nimposes. Capital is quite ‘elastic’ ( _Capital_ II: 433), constantly shifting\nthe rift. In the _Grundrisse_ , Marx also pointed out that this elasticity is\na form of capitalist power based on the ‘universal appropriation of nature’ (\n_Grundrisse_ : 409). The power of capital to buy time through metabolic shifts\nis astonishing, as history demonstrates. However, since capital’s\ninstrumentalist attitude cannot take sufficient account of the material\naspects of the world, its incessant attempt to overcome natural limits only\nposes new ones. It is not therefore possible to know a priori whether\ncapitals’ elasticity can tame a given natural limit or not.\n\nAn investigation into this _dynamic_ relationship between capital and nature\nwas the main topic for the later Marx. This is why his research shifted more\nand more to _empirical_ topics in geology, agricultural chemistry and\nmineralogy in order to comprehend these dynamics, while Engels was more\nconcerned with the transhistorical law of nature as a ‘science’ of the\nuniverse. Marx’s purpose in studying natural science differs from that of\nEngels in that he aimed to comprehend the source of capital’s astonishing\nelasticity in the interdependent historical process of social and natural\nmetabolism.\n\nSecond, Marx’s description of the disruption of the metabolism avoids the\n‘apocalyptic’ tone of nature’s revenge by emphasizing the _active_ factor of\nresistance. The boundless extension of working hours as well as the\nintensification of labour result in the alienation of labour and physical and\nmental illness. This ultimately calls for the conscious regulation of reified\npower such as by establishing the normal working day or schools for vocational\nteaching founded by the state. A similar path can be envisioned with regard to\nnature. As the disruption of the universal metabolism of nature annihilates\nthe possibilities for the co-evolution of humans and nature and even threatens\nhuman civilization, humans are obliged to establish more conscious social\nmanagement of productive activities: ‘But by destroying the circumstances\nsurrounding that metabolism, which originated in a merely natural and\nspontaneous fashion, [the capitalist mode of production] compels its\nsystematic restoration as a regulative law of social production, and in a form\nadequate to the full development of the human race’ ( _Capital_ I: 637–8).\n\nAll that capital cares about is whether its accumulation can be achieved, so\nit does not really matter even if most parts of the planet become unsuitable\nfor humans and animals to live. Instead of waiting for the collapse of\ncapitalism https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n60 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ thanks to nature’s revenge, it is\nindispensable that individuals confronting the global ecological crisis take\nactive measures for the conscious control over the metabolism with their\nenvironment.23\n\nAs a vision for such a post-capitalist society in _Capital_ , volume III, Marx\nfamously wrote:\n\nThe realm of freedom really begins only where labour determined by necessity\nand external expediency ends; it lies by its very nature beyond the sphere of\nmaterial production proper. Just as the savage must wrestle with nature to\nsatisfy his needs, to maintain and reproduce his life, so must civilized man,\nand he must do so in all forms of society and under all possible modes of\nproduction. This realm of natural necessity expands with his development,\nbecause his needs do too; but the productive forces to satisfy these expand at\nthe same time. Freedom, in this sphere, can consist only in this, that\nsocialized man, the associated producers, govern the human metabolism with\nnature in a rational way, bringing it under their collective control instead\nof being dominated by it as a blind power; accomplishing it with the least\nexpenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their\nhuman nature. But this always remains a realm of necessity. The true realm of\nfreedom, the development of human powers as an end in itself, begins beyond\nit, though it can only flourish with this realm of necessity as its basis. (\n_Capital_ III: 958–9) This passage must be compared with Engels’s view of the\nrealm of freedom quoted previously because there is an important difference:\nThe extraneous objective forces that have hitherto governed history pass under\nthe control of man himself. Only from that time will man himself, with full\nconsciousness, make his own history ‒ only from that time will the social\ncauses set in movement by him have, in the main and in a constantly growing\nmeasure, the results intended by him. It is the humanity’s leap from the realm\nof necessity to the realm of freedom.\n\n( _MECW_ 25: 270)\n\nEngels argued for the necessity to consciously apply the law of nature, and\nhis\n\n‘realm of freedom’ consists precisely in this control over nature. According\nto Engels, the recognition and practical application of natural laws enable\npeople to freely engage with nature to satisfy their own needs. That\nconstitutes\n\n‘humanity’s leap’ to the realm of freedom.\n\nIn replying to the popular criticism that Engels unlike Marx was a\n\n‘necessitarian’ (Peter Thomas 1998: 494) who thought that the transcendence of\nnatural limits will be the condition for the realization of the sphere of\nfreedom, John L. Stanley argued that both Marx and Engels recognized the\nnatural basis for the realization of human freedom (Stanley 2002: 23). In\nfact, https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 61\n\nMarx also thought of it as a necessary condition that producers confronted\nwith the disruption of metabolism associate with each other and put a ‘blind\npower’ under their conscious control. Yet this does not mean that Stanley is\ncorrect in arguing that there is no difference between Marx and Engels. Alfred\nSchmidt ([1971] 2014: 135) problematizes the ‘famous sudden leap’ to the realm\nof freedom in Engels’s vision of socialism – namely, mastery of natural laws\n_is_ identified with the realization of the realm of freedom. Again, this has\nto do with his interest in natural science. Engels, who was primarily\nconcerned with the dialectics of nature and modern science, placed great\nimportance on human freedom based on recognizing the transhistorical law of\nnature. It is control over nature that _immediately_ realizes the realm of\nfreedom.\n\nIn contrast, Marx did not forget to add that ‘this [mastery over nature]\n\nalways remains a realm of necessity’. In other words, the new society based on\nthe associated mode of production should realize the free development of\nindividuality, but this takes place _beyond_ freedom of labour. Labour is\nindispensable for human existence, and it needs to be meaningful and\nattractive for workers, but it is only one part of meaningful human activity.\nFreedom is not limited to the conscious regulation of the law of nature\nthrough natural science, and Marx’s ‘realm of freedom’ rather includes\ncreative activities such as art, the enrichment of love and friendship, caring\nfor others, and hobbies like sport, playing music and reading books, which are\nessential for the all-round development of the individual. These activities\nrealize the full development of individuality in communism. Compared to this\nvision, Engels’s view of nature rather impoverishes the content of the realm\nof freedom by reducing it to the realm of necessity and put forward the\nHegelian view of freedom as able to be realized by consciously obeying the\nnecessity: ‘Freedom is the insight into necessity’ ( _MECW_ 25: 105).\n\n\n## **iv**\n\n### **eNgels’s Notebooks aNd critique of**\n\n\n## **Political ecoNoMy**\n\nMarx’s theory of metabolism also helps us understand the meaning of his\nextensive notebooks on natural sciences after 1868. Hints for imagining the\nunwritten part of _Capital_ exist in these little-known notebooks.

Even if the reason for his\nengagement with Liebig’s _Agricultural Chemistry_ in 1864–5 has to do with the\ntheoretical question of ground rent, the meaning of Marx’s reception of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n62 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Liebig’s critique of modern agriculture cannot\nbe contained in it, but it deals with broader ecological questions. Simply\nput, Marx aimed at comprehending how disharmonies in the material world emerge\ndue to modifications of the universal metabolism of nature by the reified\npower of capital.\n\nMarx’s interest in ecological questions grew even further after 1868\n\nbecause he was not fully satisfied with Liebig’s critique of robbery\nagriculture.\n\nInstead, he gathered new materials including ones that were critical of\nLiebig’s pessimistic and Malthusian view of agricultural development ( _MEGA_\nIV/18; Saito 2017: 224). In this context, Marx’s excerpts from Carl N. Fraas,\na German agronomist in Munich, are of great importance not just for the sake\nof reconstructing Marx’s ecological development but also for investigating the\nintellectual relationship between Marx and Engels. The pair shared various\nkinds of information, including on ecological questions.\n\nMarx wrote in his letter to Engels dated 25 March 1868 that he even found a\n‘socialist tendency’ in Fraas’s warning against excessive deforestation after\nmaking detailed notes from his book _Climate and Plant World over Time_ (\n_MEGA_ IV/18):\n\nVery interesting is the book by Fraas (1847): _Klima und Pflanzenwelt_ _in_\n_der Zeit, eine Geschichte beider_ , namely as proving that climate and flora\nchange in historical times. He is a Darwinist before Darwin, and admits even\nthe species developing in historical times. But he is at the same time\nagronomist. He claims that with cultivation – depending on its degree – the\n‘moisture’ so beloved by the peasants gets lost (hence also the plants migrate\nfrom south to north), and finally steppe formation occurs.\n\nThe first effect of cultivation is useful, but finally devastating through\ndeforestation, etc. This man is both a thoroughly learned philologist (he has\nwritten books in Greek) and a chemist, agronomist, etc. The conclusion is that\ncultivation – when it proceeds in natural growth and is not consciously\ncontrolled (as a bourgeois he naturally does not reach this point) – leaves\ndeserts behind it, Persia, Mesopotamia, etc., Greece.\n\nSo once again an unconscious socialist tendency! ( _MECW_ 42: 558–9) Prompted\nby Marx’s high evaluation, Engels also later read the book by Fraas and made\nexcerpts in his notebook of 1879–80 ( _MEGA_ IV/31). It is thus possible to\ncompare Marx’s and Engels’s excerpts to see whether they really shared the\nsame interests.\n\nAs indicated in Marx’s latter to Engels, Fraas’s book deals with climate\nchange in ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Egypt and Greece, due to\nexcessive and irrational deforestation. Out of this similarity between Marx’s\nengagement with Fraas and Engels’s warning about nature’s revenge in\n_Dialectics of Nature_ , Stanley (2002: 18) points to the identity of their\nreception https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 63\n\nof Fraas’s theory. Yet Stanley only superficially compares these two isolated\nremarks in Marx’s letter and Engels’s manuscript without looking at their\nnotebooks. My detailed analysis of Marx’s notebook on Fraas’s work (Saito\n2017) provides a foundation for its comparison with Engels’s notebook on\nFraas.Although Engels’s excerpts are short because Engels had already used\nFraas’s book in his _Dialectics of Nature_ , they clearly document what he was\nmost interested in. First, one immediately notices that the intellectual\nrelationship between Marx and Engels in the field of natural science had been\nreversed compared to 1864, when Marx was still ‘invariably follow[ing] in\n[Engels’s]\n\nfootsteps’. It is noteworthy that Engels’s paraphrasing in his notebook on\nFraas indicates that his view was influenced _by_ Marx’s high evaluation of\nthe work. In other words, Engels now followed what Marx recommended to him.\n\nIn this letter, Marx highly valued Fraas’s insight that ‘cultivation – when it\nproceeds in natural growth and is not _consciously controlled_ …– leaves\ndeserts behind it’. Marx carefully studied Fraas’s explanation of how\nuncontrolled processes in ancient civilizations ultimately undermined the\nmaterial foundations of their prosperity because excessive deforestation\nirreversibly changes the local climate in a manner unfavourable to indigenous\nplants.\n\nEngels wrote down the same opinion in his notebook: ‘ _The development of_\n_people’s agriculture leaves behind an enormous desert_ ’ ( _MEGA_ IV/31: 515;\nemphasis in original). Engels summarized the significance of Fraas’s work as a\n‘main proof that civilization in its conventional forms is an antagonistic\nprocess which exhausts the soil, devastates the forest, renders the soil\ninfertile for its original products, and worsens the climate’. As an example,\nEngels noted that in Germany and Italy the average temperature increased ‘5 to\n6 degrees (°Re)’24 ( _MEGA_ IV/31: 512). This understanding that unconscious\nproduction results in ‘deserts’ is also reflected in his discussion on\nnature’s revenge in _Dialectics of Nature_. In fact, Engels argued based on\nFraas’s argument that the people who, in Mesopotamia, Greece, Asia Minor and\nelsewhere, destroyed the forests to obtain cultivable land, never dreamed that\nby removing along with the forests the collecting centres and reservoirs of\nmoisture they were laying the basis for the present forlorn state of those\ncountries. ( _MECW_ 25: 461)\n\nHere Engels was clearly influenced by Marx’s evaluation of Fraas’s work.\n\nSecond, Marx in the same letter characterized Fraas as a ‘Darwinist before\nDarwin’ ( _MECW_ 42: 558). Engels also documented in his notebook a passage\nfrom Fraas’s _Climate and Plant World_ _Over Time_ that reminds him of\nDarwin’s\n\n‘natural selection’:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n64 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ As said, oak is also quite sensitive to\nelements of natural climate (temperature and humidity), and when there is any\nsubtle change in them, oak is left behind in the competition against more\ndurable and less sensitive surrounding trees that strive together for natural\ngrowth and self-preservation. ( _MEGA_ IV/31: 515)\n\nThis passage is indicative because Engels added that he read Fraas’s book in\norder to refute the ‘belief in the stability of plant species based on a\nDarwinian argument’ ( _MEGA_ IV/31: 515). In writing this comment, he must\nhave thought that his own interests were surely identical to those of Marx.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the notebooks reveals that Marx’s interest in Fraas\nis not actually limited to nature’s revenge and a Darwinian argument. In the\nbeginning of 1868, Marx in addition to Fraas’s work carefully read Georg\nLudwig von Maurer’s _Einleitung zur Geschichte der Mark-, Hof-, Dorf-, und_\n_Stadtverfassung und der offentlichen Gewalt_ , in which the German historian\nof law dealt with the Germanic system of landed property. Actually, Marx\nplaced Fraas and Maurer in the same context by characterizing them with the\nsame ‘socialist tendency’ in his letter to Engels, and their relationship is\nmuch closer than that of Fraas and Darwin in Marx’s notebook. However, at\nfirst glance, the reason Marx simultaneously studied Germanic society is not\nclear, as Fraas and Maurer appear to have no connection. Prompted by Marx’s\nhigh evaluation of Maurer in the letter, Engels also read Maurer’s book and\nintegrated it into his own analysis. However, unlike Marx, there is no sign\nthat Engels connected Fraas and Maurer.\n\nA hint connecting Fraas and Maurer can be found in Fraas’s work _Agrarian\nCrisis and Its Solutions_ published in 1866, where Fraas quoted directly from\nMaurer’s book and praised the sustainability of lands in Germanic communes:\n\nIf the Mark village did not allow sales except among village members of wood,\nstraw, dung, and even livestock (pigs!) and also ordered that all the crops\nharvested within the village, and even wine, should be consumed within the\nvillage (out of this practice various socage rights [ _Bannrechte_]\n\nwere to emerge), the means must have been retained for the maintenance of land\npower, and furthermore, the use of additional nutrients from forests and\npastures, and even the use of meadows manured by rivers served to increase the\n[soil’s] power everywhere. (Fraas 1866: 210) As is clear from this passage,\nFrass did not maintain that all pre-capitalist societies ignored the laws of\nnature and left deserts behind them. Rather, he highlighted that in Germanic\nsociety soil productivity increased under sustainable production through their\ncommunal regulation of the land and https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 65\n\nits products, in contrast to Greek and Roman societies where commodity\nproduction existed to some extent and the communal tie of members was somewhat\ndissolved.\n\nIn December 1867 or January 1868 Marx wrote down the title of Fraas’s\n_Agrarian Crisis and Its Solutions_ in his notebook ( _MEGA_ IV/18: 359). It\nis quite likely that after reading Fraas’s book, Marx not only read further\nbooks by Fraas but was also interested in Maurer’s analysis of Germanic\ncommunes.\n\nUpon reading their books, he found the ‘socialist tendency’ in Maurer’s work\ntoo, so he came to pay more attention to different ways of organizing the\nmetabolism between humans and nature in pre-capitalist societies.25 This\npraise of the equal and sustainable production of pre-capitalist rural\ncommunes confirms that Marx did not overgeneralize nature’s revenge due to\nignorance of the laws of nature in pre-capitalist societies. Otherwise, he\nwould have fallen into the reductionist view that all civilizations are bad\nfor the environment.26\n\nRather, he recognized that the particularities of pre-capitalist metabolism\nbetween humans and nature might be the source of vitality of certain rural\ncommunes. Compared to the metabolic rift created by capitalist production,\nthese communes contain elements of economic superiority, even if equal and\nsustainable production was rather unconsciously accomplished by long-lasting\ntradition and customs, and not by recognising the laws of nature. This is why\nMarx found a ‘socialist tendency’ in Fraas’s and Maurer’s work. One should\nnote that this evaluation is quite different from Engels’s argument that pre-\ncapitalist societies suffered from nature’s revenge due to their ignorance of\nthe natural laws and that their recognition and appropriation would realize\nthe leap to the realm of freedom. It is possible to say that Engels continued\nto hold a unilateral view of historical development in this regard.\n\nFurthermore, Marx’s notebooks of 1878, which contain quite extensive\ngeological excerpts from John Yeats and Joseph Beete Jukes, are noteworthy in\nthat they expand his theory of metabolism. These long excerpts deal with\nvarious topics, and their meaning cannot be reduced to ecology. Nevertheless,\nit is clear that Marx studied geology for the sake of expanding his political\neconomy. For example, Marx noted that an ‘enormous sum of money is wasted in\ncoal-mining alone due to ignorance’ ( _MEGA_ IV/26: 478) and documented\nJukes’s comment on the ‘great practical importance’ of geology in his _Student\nManual of Geology_ , which is\n\none of the chief points in the practical applications of geology in the\nBritish islands [both for the purpose of guarding against] a wasteful\nexpenditure of money in rash enterprises, as well as [for]\n\ndirecting it where enterprise [may have a] chance of being successful.\n\n( _MEGA_ IV/26: 642)\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n66 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Furthermore, Marx paid attention to Jukes’s\ndescription of how progress in geology improves methods of discovery and\nmining of raw and auxiliary materials such as coal and iron and increases\nproductivity and how improvements in transportation influence the relationship\nbetween industry and agriculture (as well as extractive industry). What was\nunprofitable becomes profitable and what was infertile becomes fertile in the\ncourse of capitalist development. This brings about tremendous complications\nin the application of the law of the rate of profit to fall.\n\nThis does not mean that capital can be freed from geological conditions.\n\nBy contrast, Marx eagerly documented in his notebook how geologic strata, as a\nnatural condition that humans cannot modify, heavily influence the course of\nsocial development. Already in the 1850s Marx was interested in the\nrelationship between human history and natural history. For example, Marx’s\nintensive engagement with geology led him to adopt the concept of ‘geological\nformation’ from James F. W. Johnston in the _London Notebooks_ in order to\ngrasp the multiple layers of social formation; though that was a mere metaphor\nat the time. In the 1870s and 1880s, he went one step further to study the\ndirect relationship between geological formation and social formation. He\nwrote down a passage from Jukes’s book, for example:\n\n… ‘England is divided into two totally dissimilar parts, in which the form and\naspect of the ground, and condition and employment of the people,\n\n[were] alike contrasted with each other’. Namely, the part to the north-west\npart of this life is ‘chiefly Palaeozoic ground, often wild, barren and\nmountainous, but in many places full of mineral wealth.’ The part to the\nsouth-east of it consists of ‘Secondary and Tertiary ground, and generally\nsoft and gentle in outline, with little or no wealth beneath the soil’. As a\nresult, the ‘mining and manufacturing populations’ are to be found in the\nfirst district, and the ‘working people of the latter’ are mainly\n\n‘agricultural’. ( _MEGA_ IV/26: 641)\n\nIn _Capital_ , Marx envisioned a ‘new and higher synthesis, a union of\nagriculture and industry’ beyond their antithesis ( _Capital_ I: 637).\nHowever, the unchangeable geologic characteristics that Jukes pointed out must\nbe much more carefully treated when envisioning post-capitalism because they\ncannot be modified. In fact, Marx highlighted these passages in his notebooks\nso that he could come back to them later. If so, Leszek Kołakowski’s critique\nthat ‘Marx can scarcely admit that man is limited either by his body or by\ngeographical conditions’ (Kołakowski 1978: 413) is completely refuted.27\n\nIn relation to Fraas and Darwin, Marx’s excerpts from Jukes’s book are also of\ninterest because they also discussed how climate and precipitation effect the\ngeological formation as well as flora and fauna. In the section titled\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 67\n\n‘Palaeontology’, Jukes, referring directly to Darwin, pointed to great climate\nchanges over time and argued that ‘alternation of climates involves\ndestruction of species’ ( _MEGA_ IV/26: 219). In this vein, Marx also\ndocumented Jukes’s remark that ‘ _extinction of species_ is still going on (\n_man himself_ is the most active exterminator)’ ( _MEGA_ IV/26: 233; emphasis\nin original). Marx studied climate change from a long-term geological\nperspective as well as its impact upon the environment, paying particular\nattention to human impacts, as Fraas did. A similar remark on climate change\nin North America due to excessive deforestation can be found in his excerpt\nfrom Yeats’s _Natural History of_ _the Raw Materials of Commerce_ : ‘ _The\nenormous clearings_ have, on the other hand, _already sensibly modified the\nclimate_ ’ ( _MEGA_ IV/26: 36; emphasis in original). Here Marx’s interest in\nDarwin is – unlike Engels’s – not limited to encyclopaedic topics like the\norigin of life, natural selection and evolution that proceed independently of\nhumans, but encompasses the empirical and historical ways of _human_ metabolic\ninteraction with nature and its negative impacts.\n\nThe key differences between Marx and Engels in their reception of the natural\nscience can be summarized in the following way. Engels’s focus was the\nscientific recognition of the transhistorical law of nature in order to\nrealize the realm of freedom. Engels’s dialectics of nature, founded on the\nphilosophical dichotomy of consciousness/matter and idealism/materialism,\nadvocated the ontological primacy of the latter. Despite Engels’s interest in\necological issues under capitalist production, it is undeniably characterized\nby a philosophical and transhistorical scheme, as a result of which he ended\nup rejecting Liebig’s concept of metabolism and remained satisfied with the\n\n‘antithesis of town and country’ conceptualized in the 1840s. Furthermore, in\nEngels’s discussion of the realm of freedom as well as of pre-capitalist\nsocieties, he held a more unilateral vision of historical development based on\nprogressive recognition of natural laws with an aid of modern natural science.\n\nIn contrast, Marx never really adopted the project of materialist dialectics\nthat Engels was pursuing, even if he ‘may have given his friend moral support\nand encouragement to follow such wide-ranging scholarly inclinations’\n\n(O’Rourke 1974: 50). Marx, after ‘breaking away from philosophy’\n\n(Sasaki 2021: 35) in _The German Ideology_ , was not interested in such\nphilosophical ontology. In fact, his engagement with natural science came to\npossess an increasingly empirical character after the 1860s. By enriching the\nconcept of metabolism after the 1860s, Marx aimed at comprehending the\nphysical and social transformation of the relationship between humans and\nnature from historical, economic and ecological perspectives. He also came to\nstudy different ways of organizing human metabolism with nature in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n68 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ pre-capitalist and non-Western societies and\nto recognize the source of their vitality for building a more egalitarian and\nsustainable society beyond capitalism. In other words, contrary to Stanley’s\nassumption, Marx’s engagement with natural science was not for the sake of\nestablishing\n\n‘the universal science’ (Stanley 2002: 37) as he had advocated in the\n_Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts_ of 1844. Of course, this difference\nbetween the founders of Marxism need not be _over_ estimated. Marx did not\ncompletely reject Engels’s attempt to establish a materialist conception of\nnature.28 At the same time, the difference must not be _under_ estimated\nbecause it is relevant to understanding why Engels did not fully understand\nthe scope of Marx’s notebooks on natural science and modified the key passage\non the metabolic rift in volume III of _Capital_. In fact, Engels’s\nunderstanding determined the reception of Marx’s theory in the successive\ngenerations.\n\nSusan Buck-Morss once argued: ‘Surely [Marx] shared the bourgeois belief in\nprogress, and there was much in Marx’s later writings to justify Engels’s\nunderstanding of dialectics as a natural law of historical development’\n\n(Buck-Morss 1977: 62). This chapter demonstrates quite the contrary. It was\nprecisely due to this difference between ‘Marx’s later writings’ and ‘Engels’s\nunderstanding of dialectics’ that the concept of metabolism and its ecological\nimplication were marginalized throughout the 20th century. Marx’s notebooks on\nnatural science were also neglected by Engels after his death, and even\ntalented Marxists in the following generations held onto the myth of the\nintellectual division of labour between Marx and Engels. While traditional\nMarxists failed to notice the importance of Marx’s ecological concept of\nmetabolism, even those Western Marxists who determinedly rejected Engels fell\ninto the same one-sided understanding as traditional Marxists. This shows how\nstrong Engels’s influence was among Marxists in the 20th century.\n\nHowever, there was one exceptional Marxist who challenged this general trend\nand attempted to revive the Marxian legacy of metabolism. That was Lukács\nGyörgy.\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nFoster and Burkett (2016: 10) write, for example: Engels’s contributions were\nalso of extraordinary brilliance, even if frequently overshadowed by those of\nMarx. Although the two thinkers were not identical, and must be distinguished\nfrom each other, attempts to separate them entirely, which have become common\nin some circles of Western Marxism in recent years, are, in our view, self-\ndefeating and misguided. In relation to the ecological critique of capitalism,\nboth were major contributors.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 69\n\n2\n\nFoster and Burkett often refer to Marx’s notebooks, but they do not pay\nattention to their chronology or their actual content. I will highlight the\nimportance of the chronology because it reveals the development of Marx’s\ntheory.\n\n3\n\nAs Michael Heinrich (2012: 24) argues, this attempt to establish Marxism as a\nproletarian worldview began with Engels in the face of the increasing\ninfluence of Eugen Dühring in Germany. In this sense, Engels surely had a\npolitical interest in emphasizing the systematic character of Marx’s thought\nand in simplifying it so that working class people could comprehend it.\n\n4 For example, the publication of the so-called _Economic and Philosophical_\n_Manuscripts of 1844_ in 1932 as a part of _MEGA1_ led to a ‘humanist’\ncritique of Soviet Marxism. But it is also noteworthy that the Russians wanted\nto treat this bundle of text as ‘manuscripts’ and bestow a systematic\ncharacter upon the general structure of the text, even though Marx did not\nhave any actual plan to publish it. As Jürgen Rojahn (2002) shows, the text\nwas rather a spontaneous product of Marx’s process of studying political\neconomy.\n\n5 However, except for a few Marxists (for example, Heinrich [2013]; Otani\n\n[2013]), Marxian scholars do not pay attention to the economic manuscripts of\n_Capital_ even today. In a sense, their position remains close to that of\ntraditional Marxists. English translation of Marx’s manuscript of 1864–5,\nwhich is the main manuscript for volume III of _Capital_ , was published in\n2015 (Marx 2015).\n\nHowever, in its introduction, Fred Mosely (2015: 41) argues that there is no\nsignificant difference between the manuscript and Engels’s edition of\n_Capital_ except for a few points. This is the dominant attitude of Marxian\nscholars in the English-speaking world, which basically underestimates the\nimportance of the _MEGA_.\n\n6 Ironically,\n\n_Dialectics of Nature_ also remained incomplete, but the debate proceeded as\nif Engels’s philosophy were complete. Kaan Kangal (2020) challenges this\nwidely shared assumption of the more or less complete character and attempts a\nmore nuanced reconstruction and evaluation of Engels’s philosophy.\n\n7\n\nAs Merleau-Ponty points out, the expression itself, however, originally comes\nfrom _Karl Korsch’s Marxismus und Philosophie_ (Korsch 1966: 63). The relevant\nparagraph in Korsch was not translated into English, and this is probably why\nMerleau-Ponty became the reference point in the English-speaking world.\n\n8\n\nSee Chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion of the so-called Lukács problem\n(Foster, York and Clark 2010: 224).\n\n9\n\nIronically, due to its rejection of the evolutionary–ecological aspect of\nnature, Western Marxism shares with Soviet Marxism the assumption that the\nsphere of nature is the realm of mechanism and positivism.\n\n10 Throughout this book, I distinguish between ‘traditional Marxism’ and\n‘classical Marxism’. The two schools both maintain the general validity of the\nMarxian approach elaborated in _Capital_. The former is close to the Soviet\nworldview of dialectical materialism, while the latter endorses Marx’s basic\nconcepts such https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n70 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ as labour theory of value, reification, class\nand socialism without falling into determinism and reductionism.\n\n11 This does not negate the contribution of Engels to the issue of ecology,\nespecially in relation to the issue of entropy and the second law of\nthermodynamics (Foster and Burkett 2016; Foster 2020; Royle 2020). The aim of\nthis chapter is rather to understand the differences between Marx and Engels.\n\n12 Of course, not all Western Marxists deserve the same degree of criticism.\n\nAlthough Lukács at first reproached the application of dialectic to nature, he\nalso admitted that Marx did not completely separate the relationship between\n‘society’\n\nand ‘nature’ but comprehended both in their integrity (Foster 2013). As\ndiscussed in the next chapter, in _Tailism and the Dialectic_ Lukács (2002)\nrecognized that the concept of ‘metabolism’ expresses this unity, even by\nacknowledging the existence of dialectics of nature. Also, Herbert Marcuse\nwrote: ‘History is also grounded in nature. And Marxist theory has the least\njustification to ignore the metabolism between the human being and nature’\n(Marcuse 1978: 16), leading him to a much more active engagement with the\necological crisis in his last years (Marcuse 1992). This is not a coincidence\nbecause, as seen in the previous chapter, the concept of metabolism is the key\nterm for the Marxian ecological critique of capitalism. This marks a clear\ncontrast to Alfred Schmidt ([1971]\n\n2014), who can only integrate ecological critique by criticizing Marx and\nhaving recourse to the romanticism of Ludwig Feuerbach (Saito 2017: 85). Yet\nthere is also a possibility of developing a critical theory of nature based on\nAdorno’s philosophy of non-identity (Cassegård 2021). I return to this issue\nin Chapter 4.\n\n13 Chapter 5 corresponds to part 5 (chapters 21–36) of the current edition\nedited by Engels.\n\n14 The second modification might be due to Marx’s bad handwriting because\n_Boden_ and _Leben_ look similar in his original handwriting.\n\n15 Considering the importance of this passage, it is very unfortunate that the\nrecent English translation from Marx’s manuscript for volume III of _Capital_\n(Marx 2015) is heavily dependent on Ben Fowkes’s earlier translation of the\nEngels edition published by Penguin. It often ignores Marx’s original text,\nwhich basically ruins the basic meaning of this translation project.\nUnfortunately, this key passage quoted here is one of those examples. Fred\nMosely, who wrote the introduction to this translation, does not consider\nthese changes. If one does not pay attention to these ‘minor’ changes, it is\nnot necessary to read the manuscript from the beginning, but one can simply\ncontinue reading Engels’s edition.\n\nHowever, without a careful reading of these changes, one inevitably ends up\nconcluding that there is no important difference between the Engels edition\nand Marx’s original manuscript. For a further critique of this translation,\nsee Sasaki (2018).\n\n16 To be fair, Engels did not simply separate objective natural laws and human\nconsciousness. The famous discussion on the role of labour in the transition\nfrom ape to human cannot be reduced to a mechanistic explanation. Furthermore,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.003 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Intellectual Relationship between Marx and Engels Revisited_ | 71\n\nhis interest in Darwin’s theory of evolution as well as thermodynamics clearly\nrejected the mechanistic worldview. Rather, in contrast to Engels’s alleged\npositivism (Peter Thomas 1988), his dialectics is an investigation of the\ninterconnected universality of nature, which is characterized by continuous\nintegration of qualitatively new emergent properties (Foster 2020).\n\n17 Here again, Engels is not a mechanically materialist thinker.\n\n18 This has to do with the fact that Engels’s economic understanding of\ncapitalism is also tied to the so-called breakdown theory. He did not\nappreciate Marx’s concept of ‘productive forces of capital’ and the ‘real\nsubsumption of labour under capital’, which will be discussed in Chapter 5.\n\n19 Of course, Liebig was also not entirely a naïve vitalist. In the 1840s,\nLiebig conceived the processes of absorption, assimilation and excretion of\nnutrients as\n\n‘metabolism’ and tried to explain this life activity as a chemical process.\nOne of his great achievements as a chemist at the time was the discovery of\nthe organic compound of hippuric acid, demonstrating the possibility of\novercoming the\n\n‘two kinds of kingdom’, that is, the spheres of plants and animals (Goodman\n1972). Animals were supposed to consume what plants provide, but Liebig found\nthat horses (and, of course, other animals) also produce organic compounds in\nthe course of their metabolism. Liebig’s theory of metabolism is actually\nquite critical of the dominant vitalist dualism of Jean-Baptiste André Dumas\nand Jean Baptiste Boussignault. Notwithstanding, Liebig could not fully\nabandon the idea of vital forces either (Brock 1997: 313).\n\n20 Lukács (2002) started with a similar dialectics of nature independent of\nhumans, but he also used the concept of metabolism to trace the further\ndevelopment of dialectics in the sphere of the social. See the discussion in\nChapter 3.\n\n21 Using this scheme, Engels predicted that the technological development and\nplanned economy in socialism would render concentration in large cities\nunnecessary and thus overcome the antagonism:\n\nAbolition of the antithesis between town and country is not merely possible.\nIt has become a direct necessity of industrial production itself, just as it\nhas become a necessity of agricultural production and, besides, of public\nhealth.… It is true that in the huge towns civilisation has bequeathed us a\nheritage which it will take much time and trouble to get rid of.

Since the entire surface of our\nplanet is now covered by traces of human economic activities, there apparently\nexists no pristine ‘nature’ that remains untouched by humans. Bill McKibben’s\nclaim about the ‘end of nature’ (McKibben 1989) has become quite compelling 30\nyears after it was first pronounced, but the full-blown impact of climate\nchange beyond any human control signifies the ultimate failure of the modern\nPromethean dream of absolute domination over nature. The catastrophic\nsituation created by this failure recalls Engels’s warning about the ‘revenge’\n\nof nature as well as Max Horkheimer’s discussion of the ‘revolt of nature’ in\n_Eclipse of Reason_(Horkheimer [1947] 2005: 86).\n\nThe ‘revenge’ and ‘revolt’ of nature seem to redistribute the agency, creating\na new ontological situation, in which the passive ‘things’ in nature appear to\nacquire agency _against_ humans. This appearance of the total remaking of\nnature as well as the new agency of things is the reason why both Noel\nCastree’s\n\n‘production of nature’ and Bruno Latour’s ‘actor–network theory’ (ANT) are\ngaining increasing popularity in recent debates over political ecology. While\nCastree (2005) denies the existence of a nature independent of human beings,\nLatour (1993) rejects the modern dualist conception of subject and object,\nredistributing agency to things as ‘actants’. Their ideas are certainly quite\ndifferent, but they share a common belief in the superiority of ontological\nmonism over dualism in the face of the _hybridity_ of the social and the\nnatural that they think of as characteristic of the Anthropocene.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n74 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ In this context, the Marxian concept of\n‘metabolism’ ( _Stoffwechsel_) as the theoretical foundation for Marxian\necology has been the target of harsh criticism. Especially, its central\nconcept of ‘metabolic rift’ has been accused of ‘epistemic rift’ (Schneider\nand McMichael 2010: 467) due to its ‘Cartesian dualism’ of ‘Nature’ and\n‘Society’ as two fully separate and independent entities. There are\naccordingly various attempts even among Marxists – particularly by Jason W.\nMoore (2015) – to replace this dualist treatment of capitalist development\nwith a post-Cartesian one for a better understanding of the current ecological\ncrisis. It is unfortunate that Marx never systematically elaborated on the\nontological status of nature in his critique of political economy – it was not\nthe task of his critique of political economy to elaborate on such an issue.\nHowever, not every Marxist ignored its theoretical relevance. This chapter\nmakes recourse to Lukács György and his _History and Class Consciousness_ in\norder to reply to recent critics in defence of Marx’s theory of metabolic\nrift.\n\nThis approach might sound contradictory, as Chapter 2 criticized the unjust\nneglect of nature in the tradition of Western Marxism. In fact, as the\nfoundational work of Western Marxism Lukács’s _History and Class\nConsciousness_ can be regarded precisely as an attempt to exclude the sphere\nof nature from Marx’s dialectical analysis. Furthermore, _History and Class\nConsciousness_ has been criticized for its inconsequent ‘ontological dualism’\n(Vogel 1996).\n\nHowever, the lack of clarity in Lukács’s _History and Class Consciousness_\ncomes not only from his ‘premature’ thinking but also from the difficulties he\nfaced in attempting to criticize Orthodox Marxism in the 1920s. For political\nreasons, he was often compelled to hide or obscure his real intentions, which\nled to various critiques against his ambivalences and inconsistencies. These\ncriticisms continue to constrain our understanding of his work until today.\n\nIn replying to these critics, I will argue that by looking at Lukács’s theory\nof metabolism more carefully, as it is developed especially in his self-\ndefence of _History and Class Consciousness,_ published much later under the\ntitle _Tailism and the Dialectic_ , the position he elaborated in _History and\nClass_ _Consciousness_ is _not_ incoherent. Furthermore, Lukács’s theory of\nmetabolism is also relevant to today’s debates as it is superior to that of\nhis critics in its avoidance of both Cartesian dualism and Latourian monism.\nIn order to demonstrate this point, this chapter first reconstructs the\nalleged inconsistency of Lukács’s ‘methodological’ and ‘ontological dualism’\n(I). It then defends the theoretical consistency of _History and Class\nConsciousness_ in the face of criticism of his grave inconsistencies, by\nlooking at Lukács’s unpublished _Tailism and the Dialectic_. However, despite\nthe discovery of this manuscript, criticisms of Lukács remain. The main\nchallenge comes from Paul Burkett’s critique of Lukács’s ‘scientific dualism’\nthat he thinks is incompatible with https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 75\n\nMarx’s materialism (II). Against such a critique, I will show that Lukács\ncorrectly adopted Marx’s own method as well as his theory of metabolism. On\nthe one hand, he argued for ‘ontological monism’ based on Marx’s theory of\nmetabolism. However, Lukács also advocated for ‘methodological dualism’ with\nhis concept of ‘identity of identity and non-identity’, which he took over\nfrom the young Hegel’s conception of the absolute (III). Developing the\nMarxist treatment of the problem of nature, Lukács contributed to establishing\nan ecosocialist realism for a critical analysis of the global ecological\ncrisis in the Anthropocene (IV).1\n\n\n## **i**\n\n**‘aMbivaleNces’ iN _History and Class ConsCiousness_**\n\n_History and Class Consciousness_ is fundamentally a work of disputes,\nchallenging the dogmas of Orthodox Marxism and attempting to explore the true\nlegacy of Marx’s philosophy. Such an ambitious project inevitably triggered a\nlot of criticisms in the 1920s. Even those who are sympathetic to Lukács’s\ngood intention, almost without exception point to the theoretical\ncontradictions and to the difficulties that emerged because he was still\ntrapped in the paradigm of Orthodox Marxism (Fracchia 2013: 87). One of the\nmain problems arises in his treatment of society and nature. This is of great\ninterest here as it has to do with the intellectual relation between Marx and\nEngels that was discussed in the previous chapter.\n\nIn a famous footnote in _History and Class Consciousness_ , Lukács limited the\napplicability of Marx’s dialectical method only to society while reproaching\nEngels’s unjustified expansion of the dialectical method to nature: It is of\nthe first importance to realize that the method is limited here to the realms\nof history and society [ _historisch-soziale Wirklichkeit_]. The\nmisunderstandings that arise from Engels’s account of dialectics can in the\nmain be put down to the fact that Engels – following Hegel’s mistaken lead –\nextended the method to apply also to knowledge of nature. However, the crucial\ndeterminants of dialectics – the interaction of subject and object, the unity\nof theory and practice, the historical changes in the reality underlying the\ncategories as the root cause of changes in thought, etc. – are absent from our\nknowledge of nature.\n\n(Lukács 1971: 24)\n\nIt is this claim, though hidden in a footnote, that made him one of the ‘real\noriginators of the whole pattern of Western Marxism’ (P. Anderson 1976: 29),\nwhose main characteristic is the dismissal of Engels’s dialectics of nature\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n76 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ by highlighting its fundamental difference\nfrom Marx’s social philosophy.2\n\nAccording to Lukács, two methods, one for natural science and the other for\nsocial analysis, must be strictly separated and must not be confused.\nOtherwise, the method of natural science will intrude into Marxist social\nanalysis so that the Soviet mechanistic understanding of social development\nwould emerge, as was the case in Nikolai Bukharin’s positivist dialectic.\nAccording to the standard interpretation, Lukács intended to save Marxism from\nEngels’s scientism, which is incompatible with Marx’s original dialectical\nmethod.\n\nLukács’s criticism became quite influential, determining the general direction\nof Western Marxism.\n\nHowever, as seen in Chapter 2, such a rigorous separation of Marx and Engels\nas well as of social science and natural science met with a negative response.\nAllen Wood, for example, argues that the interpretation put forward by Lukács\n‘has no basis whatever in Marx’s texts’ as he more than once explicitly\nasserts that dialectical principles are ‘verified equally in history and\nnatural science’ (A. Wood 1981: 223). This was a common reaction already in\nthe 1920s. Antonio Gramsci, another original founder of Western Marxism,\nquestioned Lukács’s claim in the following manner in his _Prison Notebooks_ :\n\n[Lukács] seems to contend that we can deal with dialectics only about the\nhuman history but not about nature.... If his claim presupposes a dualism\nbetween nature and humans it is wrong.... How can we disconnect dialectics\nfrom nature if we should grasp the history of humans as the history of nature\nas well (besides, through the history of sciences)?\n\n(Gramsci 1971: 448)\n\nToday’s general evaluation of Lukács’s provocative claim is that, though his\nintention was correct, he ‘erred in the opposite direction by separating them\ntoo categorically’ (Jay 1984: 116).\n\nIn this context, Steven Vogel in his _Against Nature_ characterizes Lukács’s\ndistinction of society and nature as ‘methodological dualism’, which prohibits\nthe misapplication of two methods. This distinction between social analysis\nand natural science assumes that there is a real border that must not be\nviolated. Thus, Vogel points out that this methodological dualism is\nnecessarily accompanied by ‘ _ontological_ dualism’ of nature and society\n(Vogel 1996: 18; emphasis in original). In short, the particularities of each\nrealm that require different methods stem from the differences of properties\nunique to the respective realms.\n\nHowever, Vogel finds this implicit presupposition of ontological dualism in\nLukács’s discussion problematic because this ontological distinction runs\ncounter to Marx’s fundamental materialist claim about the continuity of nature\nand humanity. According to Vogel (1996: 41), Marx’s concept of metabolism\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 77\n\nexpresses the ontological situation where ‘the natural and the social are\nwoven together in an inextricable connection’. In other words, Lukács’s\n‘ontological dualism’ is not compatible with Marxian materialism as\n‘ontological monism’.\n\nAccording to Vogel, Lukács as a talented Marxist was actually aware of this\nincompatibility, but he could not fully give up ontological dualism. As a\nconsequence, Lukács ended up suffering from various inconsistencies and\ncontradictions in _History and Class Consciousness_.\n\nVogel maintains that one of Lukács’s ambivalences manifests in his attitude\ntowards the progress of modern natural science. On the one hand, Lukács seems\nto believe that the application of the method of natural science in the realms\nof nature produces _more objective_ and _less problematical –_ that is, less\nideological – knowledge than social science: ‘When the ideal of scientific\nknowledge is applied to nature _it simply furthers the progress of science_.\nBut _when_ _it is applied to society_ it turns out to be ideological weapon of\nthe bourgeoisie’\n\n(Lukács 1971: 10; emphasis added). In this passage, Lukács appears to simply\nproblematize the misapplication of the method of natural science to society as\na tool of bourgeois domination, but not its correct application within natural\nscience.\n\nOn the other hand, Lukács’s _History and Class Consciousness –_ especially in\nits most prominent essay ‘Reification and the Consciousness of the\nProletariat’ – criticized modern science by revealing the problems that arise\nfrom its ‘contemplative attitude’. Vogel (1996: 21) summarizes Lukács’s\ncritique of natural science in four points. The first principle of natural\nscience is _immediacy_. Nature appears as given and can be objectively known\nas ‘pure facts’: ‘the immediately given form of the objects, the fact of their\nexisting here and now and in this particular way appears to be primary, real\nand objective’\n\n(Lukács 1971: 154). Second, this creation of ‘pure facts’ is carried out\nthrough the _total quantification_ of the world. Modern science aims at\nquantifying everything in a mechanistic fashion so that its objects of study\ncan be comprehended with regular, universal and predictable laws, which allows\nhumans to manipulate them. The third principle is _simplicity._ For the sake\nof calculability, the complicated appearance of natural phenomena must first\nbe broken down to simple elements, and then they can be combined to explain\nmore complicated phenomena. The fourth principle is _ahistoricity_. The\nmechanistic law of nature is supposed to be eternal and unchanging over time.\n\nLukács rejected these naïve presuppositions of modern science by arguing that\nthis kind of ‘formalism’ reflects the world of ‘reification’ created by\ncapital – that is, the world of quantified things that appear as an alien\nforce to humans. This reified worldview in Lukács’s view results in various\ntheoretical difficulties in natural science because it has to forcefully\nabstract from the complexity of the real world. First, the objectivism\ninherent in the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n78 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ idea of immediacy is unable to erase all\nsubjective aspects from its analysis.\n\nSecond, quantification for the sake of calculability neglects various concrete\nand qualitative aspects of the world that resist quantification. Third, the\nreductionistic method based on simplicity suffers from the loss of totality\nand consists only of isolated facts, so it is unable to deal with holistic and\nrelational properties of the world. Finally, an ahistorical understanding of\nnature cannot explain historical and evolutionary changes, so they must be\ndismissed as mere contingency. In short, the formalism of modern science finds\nthe concreteness and qualitative diversity of the real material world ‘beyond\nits grasp’\n\n(Lukács 1971: 105). Natural science presents itself as a neutral and objective\nscience that can explain everything in the universe, but in reality, insisted\nLukács, its neutrality and objectivity are secured only by violently\ndismissing the unquantifiable and temporal aspects of the material world.\n\nAccording to Lukács, this method of natural science became dominant because it\nworked in favour of the capitalist production, whose rationalization of the\nproduction process is directed by the drive to maximize profit. With this\nbackground, natural science even functions as a ‘bourgeois ideology’: its\napplication contributes to the radical transformation and reorganization of\nthe entire process of production in favour of capital’s valorization by\nstrengthening its domination over workers. Simultaneously, naturalism obscures\nthis capitalist function of science that is hostile to workers by presenting\nitself as an objective and neutral method of investigating unchanging ‘pure\nfacts’. It mystifies the underlying social relations of capitalism behind\nthose facts and compels everyone to accept them as given:\n\nAs the products of historical evolution they are involved in continuous\nchange. But in addition they are also precisely in their objective structure\nthe products of a definite historical epoch, namely capitalism. Thus when\n\n‘science’ maintains that the manner in which data immediately present\nthemselves is an adequate foundation of scientific conceptualisation and that\nthe actual form of these data is the appropriate starting-point for the\nformation of scientific concepts, it thereby takes its stand simply and\ndogmatically on the basis of capitalist society. It uncritically accepts the\nnature of the object as it is given and the laws of that society as the\nunalterable foundation of ‘science’. (Lukács 1971: 7) Human lives are subsumed\ninto the quantified world of science – especially in the labour process, where\nthe fruits of natural science are actively applied as technologies in order to\nincrease the productive forces of capital. Consequently, a naturalistic and\nobjectivistic rationalization ultimately creates the ‘reified’\n\nworld in which humans are subjugated to the alien forces of non-human objects.\nIn fact, the uniquely capitalist element of commodity production\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 79\n\nmodifies the labour process into abstract, fragmented and repetitive\nactivities under the system of mechanical rationalization. The production\nprocess is increasingly quantified through a breakdown of organic activities\nof labour into partial activities that exclude any arbitrary, contingent and\nsubjective factors, and workers can only participate in the automated process\nwith the same ‘contemplative attitude’. Based on the principle of\ncalculability, capital aims ‘to abandon empiricism, tradition and material\ndependence’, so that human activities are reified only to acquire a thing-like\ncharacter. This is how the realm of society becomes ‘second nature’. The\nsphere of the social and that of the natural get closer to each other than\never in modern capitalism.\n\nOntological dualism starts to collapse here. This is exactly why, in Vogel’s\nview, Lukács’s critique of natural science is _not_ consistent. If the\nknowledge of nature is thoroughly mediated by social relations under\ncapitalism, there is no longer any essential superiority of natural science\nover social science. If Lukács’s critique of modern science is right, the\nneutrality of natural science turns out to be ‘bourgeois ideology’. This\nconclusion apparently contradicts Lukács’s own earlier statement about the\nneutrality of natural science. Furthermore, Lukács criticized the\npresupposition of the immediacy of nature. Nature is not simply given without\nany historical change but is thoroughly mediated by social relations. What\nappears to be ahistorical turns out to be always already mediated and modified\nby a certain set of social relations. Lukács even proclaimed that ‘nature is a\nsocial category’ (Lukács 1971: 130). This is also problematic in Vogel’s view.\nIf nature is really a social category, then it becomes a social construct. It\nis no longer possible to maintain ontological dualism between the social and\nthe natural because both are _social constructs_. However, if ontological\ndualism breaks down, methodological dualism collapses as well, and Lukács,\ndespite his alleged loyalty to Marx’s materialism, falls into an\n\n‘idealist’ social constructivism of nature.3\n\nIn this vein, Steven Vogel attempts to save Lukács’s legacy. His radical\nsolution, however, is to push Lukács’s remark that ‘nature is a social\ncategory’\n\nmuch further by maintaining that nature is ‘ _literally_ socially\nconstructed’: ‘the\n\n“natural” world and the social one are not distinguishable’ (Vogel 1996: 7;\nemphasis in original).4 According to Vogel, Lukács’s critique of false\nimmediacy in _History and Class Consciousness_ should have led him to both\n‘methodological’\n\nand ‘ontological _monism_ ’. Vogel laments that although Lukács hinted this\npossibility, he was not able to pursue this radical path of social\nconstruction of nature because, for classical Marxists like Lukács, the claim\nthat nature is\n\n‘built’ was ‘too close to the sort of idealist’ (Vogel 1996: 40).\n\nVogel’s idea of the social construction of nature might remind us of Marx’s\nown critique of Ludwig Feuerbach in _The German Ideology_ : ‘He does\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n80 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ not see that the sensuous world around him is\nnot a thing given direct from all eternity, [… but] a historical product, the\nresult of the activity of a whole succession of generations, each standing on\nthe shoulders of the preceding one’ ( _MECW_ 5: 39). Marx wrote already in\n1844 that humankind as a\n\n‘species being’ would be able to ‘see himself in a world that he has created’\n\n( _MECW_ 3: 277) once capitalist alienation is transcended in communism. In\nfact, the idea of ‘production of nature’ may seem a perfect description of the\nontological situation of the Anthropocene, where nature as such no longer\nexists due to planetary human intervention. While Marx could still count as a\nperfect prophet of the Anthropocene, Lukács’s ontological dualism, on the\ncontrary, appears totally outdated.\n\n\n## **ii**\n\n### **lukács’s dialectics of Nature aNd**\n\n\n## **scieNtific dualisM**\n\nLukács’s ‘ambiguities’ and ‘inconsistencies’ can be summed up in two points.\n\nFirst, his ‘methodological dualism’ assumes that the method of natural science\ncan produce a neutral and objective knowledge, while the method of social\nscience reveals the historicity and class character of the bourgeois\ncategories.\n\nHowever, Lukács’s critique of modern science reveals the ideological and\nhistorical character of natural science under capitalism. Thus, the first\nambiguity is related to ‘scientific dualism’. Second, Lukács’s ‘ontological\ndualism’ presupposes that there is an undialectical nature that exists prior\nto and independently of society. At the same time, he also emphasizes that\n‘nature is a social category’. This is the second ambiguity concerning\n‘ontological dualism’, especially with regard to the ontological status of\nnature.\n\nHowever, considering Lukács’s undoubted philosophical talents, it is odd that\nhe made such obvious mistakes because these two ambiguities are too clear to\nbe overlooked:\n\n1\\. If he so thoroughly criticized the presupposition of immediacy in natural\nscience, it would not make sense to simultaneously argue, based on\n\n‘scientific dualism’, that natural science is neutral and ideology-free.\n\n2\\. If he explicitly said that nature is a ‘social category’, it would\nobviously be contradictory to suppose the ‘ontological dualism’ of Society and\nNature at the same time.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to be more cautious in dealing with Lukács’s\nargument and to suspect that Vogel and others may have missed something.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 81\n\nOne needs to re-examine if there really is no alternative interpretation of\n_History and Class Consciousness_ that can be more consistent, compelling and\nproductive.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to suspect that Lukács’s remark in a footnote was\nexaggerated by later generations. Western Marxism used Lukács’s footnote to\njustify its own decision to focus on the sphere of society.5 This decision was\naccompanied by scapegoating Engels as a figure who founded a positivist\nmethodology that led to Stalinism. In other words, the footnote was rather\n_politically_ utilized in order to clearly differentiate those authors in\nWestern Europe from Soviet Marxism and thereby to save Marx. By excluding the\nsphere of nature, Western Marxism restricted Marx’s conclusions to society,\nand their discussions came to pivot around the concept of ‘reification’ as a\nnormative foundation for a critique of capitalism (Honneth 2008). It is\nprobable that Lukács’s alleged ‘ambiguities’ emerged precisely because Western\nMarxism too easily avoided the problem of nature in his _History and Class_\n_Consciousness_ based on a single footnote as a justification for its own\nexclusive focus on the realm of society. However, such an interpretation not\nonly turns out to be incompatible with Lukács’s own view but also\nsignificantly narrows his theoretical scope of ‘reification’, which has\nserious consequences today. By its omission of the problem of nature from\nMarxism, Western Marxism is unable to deal adequately with the ecological\ncrisis.\n\nOne may respond in the following manner. Lukács’s later self-criticism of\n_History and Class Consciousness_ might be taken as a reason to deny any\npossibility of defending its theoretical consistency. When he finally gave\npermission to reprint _History and Class Consciousness_ in 1967, Lukács added\na long, self-critical preface. In this preface, he explicitly regretted the\nfact that his treatment of nature as a ‘social category’ strengthened ‘the\ntendency to view Marxism exclusively as a theory of society, as social\nphilosophy, and hence to ignore or repudiate it as a theory of nature’ (Lukács\n1971: xvi). This was, Lukács wrote, due to the fact that the central Marxist\nconcept of ‘labour’ was missing in _History and Class Consciousness_ , even\nthough it is the fundamental activity mediating the metabolic exchange between\nsociety and nature: ‘… the purview of economics is narrowed down because its\nbasic Marxist category, labor as the mediator of the metabolism between\nsociety and nature, is missing’ (Lukács 1971: xvi). In the 1960s, Lukács\napparently abandoned his original claim from the 1920s and gave credibility to\nthe Western Marxist interpretation of his work, even if he now distanced\nhimself from it.\n\nHowever, Lukács hid an important fact in this preface. Although widely ignored\neven today, the discovery of Lukács’s manuscript _Tailism and the Dialectic_\n,6\n\nwritten between 1925 and 1926, and its subsequent publication in 1996\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n82 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ challenges his claim made in 1967. The\nexistence of the manuscript was totally unknown for a long time as he made no\nreference to it during his lifetime, and it was only later discovered in the\njoint archive of the Comintern and the Central Party Archive of the Communist\nParty of the Soviet Union (CPSU).\n\nThis early manuscript, which Vogel and others do not take into account, is of\ngreat significance for the current investigation because Lukács attempted to\nrespond to criticisms raised against _History and Class Consciousness_ and\nstill passionately defended his own claims, especially with regard to the\nproblem of nature.7 His key concept here is ‘metabolism’ ( _Stoffwechsel_).\n\nLukács’s _Tailism and the Dialectic_ fundamentally differs from the preface of\n1967 in that he drew upon Marx’s concept of ‘metabolism’ between humans and\nnature in order to _defend_ the central thesis about the problem of nature\ndeveloped in _History and Class Consciousness_. As quoted earlier, he utilised\nthe same concept for the opposite reason in the preface of 1967. In other\nwords, when he later used the lack of this concept as proof of his inadequate\ntreatment of nature in _History of Class Consciousness_ , Lukács distorted the\nhistory of his personal intellectual development. It is true that the concept\nof ‘metabolism’\n\ndoes not play a central role in _History and Class Consciousness_. However, in\n1925–6, Lukács insisted that the concept of ‘metabolism’ is indispensable to\ncorrectly understand the key theme in _History and Class Consciousness_ ,\nnamely, to avoid the ontological dualism of Nature and Society and the one-\nsided focus on society. This one-sidedness is exactly the consequence into\nwhich Western Marxism fell by ignoring Marx’s concept of ‘metabolism’. Lukács\nwas already well aware of this risk at the time, and this is why he came to\nhighlight the importance of the concept of ‘metabolism’ in the unpublished\nmanuscript.\n\nKnowing the existence of the manuscript, it becomes more interesting to reread\nthe preface of 1967 because even there Lukács tacitly said that\n\n‘ _contrary to the subjective intentions of its author_ , objectively it falls\nin with a tendency in the history of Marxism’ to ‘view Marxism exclusively as\na theory of society’ (Lukács 1971: xvi; emphasis added). The ‘objective’\nconsequence of this is clearly discernible in various critiques raised against\nhim and the aftermath of Western Marxism. By contrast, it is worth examining\nwhat Lukács’s own ‘subjective intentions’ actually were because no one has\nproperly investigated this issue. One can find hints in _Tailism and the\nDialectic._\n\nIn this unpublished manuscript, Lukács attempted to reply to his critics such\nas Abram Deborin, the Russian Marxist, and Ladislaus Rudas, who was an\ninfluential Marxist–Leninist philosopher in the Hungarian Communist Party.\nThese orthodox Marxists actually picked up the footnote about the\n\n‘methodological dualism’, arguing that Lukács’s rigid separation of society\nand nature inevitably made him fall into ‘ontological dualism’, which is\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 83\n\nincompatible with Marxism because materialism should be founded on ontological\nmonism. Rudas wrote, for example:\n\nIf the dialectic is restricted to society, then two worlds exist, with two\nquite different sets of laws: nature and society. In nature phenomena are\nundialectical, in society they are dialectical. Fine. All the great\nphilosophers may have been monists, but that does not mean that they were\nright. According to L. the world is dualist. (Rudas 1924: 502)8\n\nRudas also argued that Lukács’s view is contaminated by idealist\n‘subjectivism’\n\nwhose social constructivist idea in the social realm ignores the objective,\nmaterial preconditions for the formation of class consciousness and socialist\nrevolution. Due to the footnote, Lukács in the 1920s was already criticized\nfor his dualism and idealism. This is why it is worth taking a closer look at\nhis counterargument in _Tailism and the Dialectic._\n\nWhat is most important in the current context, however, is Rudas’s use of the\nconcept _Stoffwechsel_ in his article ‘Oxthodoxer Marxismus?’. It is with this\nconcept that he criticized the separation of society and nature in Lukács’s\n_History and Class Consciousness_ and defended Engels’s dialectics of nature\nwith reference to Marx’s _Capital_ : ‘For in this sense industry is an eternal\nnatural process between humans and nature in which humans mediate their\nmetabolism with nature (Marx. Kapital. I. 140)’ (Rudas 1924: 515).9 According\nto Rudas, since the concept of metabolism is missing, laws of nature suddenly\ndisappear in Lukács’s analysis of capitalist society as if society could exist\nindependently of them. Deborin (1924: 617) agreed with Rudas’s critique of\ndualism, adding that it is precisely in the labour process in which the\nidentity of subject and object is realized, unlike in Lukács’s ‘idealist’\napproach to this problem based on his Hegelian speculative idealism.\n\nNotwithstanding this, it may seem strange that Lukács responded so seriously\nto ‘second-rate authors’ like Rudas and Deborin in _Tailism and_ _the\nDialectic._ Michael Löwy (2013: 66–7) regards this, together with the absence\nof the concept of ‘reification’, as one of the ‘serious shortcomings’ of\n_Tailism and the Dialectic_. He maintains that Lukács did not publish it\nbecause he had ‘doubts’ and ‘finally changed his mind and did not agree\nanymore with its political and philosophical orientation’. This need not to be\nthe case. Lukács utilised the critiques raised by Rudas and Deborin as an\nimportant opportunity to elaborate on his own ‘subjective intention’. Rudas’s\nreference to the concept of ‘metabolism’ in _Capital_ , to which Lukács did\nnot pay sufficient attention in _History and Class Consciousness_ , prompted\nhim to reflect upon his inappropriate and inaccurate expression in the\nfootnote. Even if he decided not to publish _Tailism and the Dialectic_ –\nwhich can be equally well explained from the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n84 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ political situation surrounding him – the\nconcept of metabolism remained central to Lukács’s philosophical project even\nin his last unfinished manuscript _Ontology of Social Being_( _Zur Ontologie\ndes gesellschaftlichen Seins_). This fact indicates how important the debate\nwith Rudas and Deborin was to the development of some of his key life-long\nideas.\n\nFirst, in _Tailism and the Dialectic_ Lukács reflected upon his formulation of\nthe controversial footnote. He clarified his ‘subjective intention’ in the\nfootnote in _History and Class Consciousness_ by stating that he talked\n‘always (on two occasions!) only of _knowledge of nature_ and not nature\nitself ’ (Lukács 2002: 97; emphasis in original). According to Lukács, it is\nsimply wrong to say that his critique of Engels’s dialectics of nature would\nlead to the idealist construction of nature because he was only talking about\n‘knowledge of nature’. In other words, Lukács’s position differs from Steven\nVogel’s social constructivist approach to nature, even when he said ‘nature is\na social category’.\n\nHe meant that knowledge of nature is conditioned by social relations. This is\nan epistemological argument. In fact, after claiming that nature is ‘a social\ncategory’, Lukács actually continued to argue in _History and Class\nConsciousness_ :\n\n‘That is to say, what _passes for nature_ … [is] all socially conditioned’\n(Lukács 1971: 234; emphasis added). Here he did not talk about the ontological\nstatus of nature at all (Feenberg 2017: 130).\n\nIn fact, Lukács explicitly recognized the objective existence of nature prior\nto human beings: ‘Self-evidently society arose from nature. Self-evidently\nnature and its laws existed before society (that is to say before humans)’\n\n(Lukács 2002: 102). Notably, this remark also points to the fundamental\n_continuity_ of society and nature as society ‘arose’ from nature. His\nintention to distance himself from Cartesian dualism is clear. In other words,\nhe held with neither social constructivism of nature nor ontological dualism.\nLukács also had no intention of denying the existence of an objective\ndialectics of nature, which ‘exist prior to people and function independently\nof them’\n\n(Lukács 2002: 103): ‘Self-evidently the dialectic _could_ not possibly be\neffective as an _objective principle of development_ of society, if it were\nnot already effective as a principle of development of nature before society,\nif it did not already _objectively exist_ ’ (Lukács 2002: 102; emphasis in\noriginal). Dialectics of society exist objectively only because dialectics of\nnature existed prior to the formation of society and because society arose\nfrom nature. This remark constitutes a complete negation of Western Marxism,\nwhich argues that ‘the idea (later espoused by Engels) that nature exists\nindependently of, and prior to, man’s efforts to transform it is utterly\nforeign to Marx’s humanism’ (Ball 1979: 471).\n\nAfter all, his point in the footnote of _History and Class Consciousness_ is\n_not_ that dialectics of nature do not exist. He rather argued that it cannot\nbe directly applied to the analysis of society because society does not simply\nconsist of natural laws independent of humans. The sphere of society contains\nuniquely https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 85\n\nsocial dimensions consisting of interrelations of the subject and the object.\n\nThis is why ‘methodological dualism’ is necessary _despite_ Lukács’s\nendorsement of ‘ontological monism’ in the spirit of Marxist materialism.\n\nLukács’s claim is understandable in the face of the tendency within Soviet\nMarxism that emerged from Engels’s usage of dialectics through the\ngeneralization of the objective dialectics of nature over the whole society.\nWhat Lukács problematized is Engels’s explanation of how ‘dialectical’\nknowledge can be acquired through scientific experiment. For example, Engels\nmaintained that even Kant’s ‘thing in itself ’ can be known thanks to the\ndevelopment of natural science through industry and experiments in the\nlaboratory. However, according to Lukács:\n\nBut Engels’ deepest misunderstanding consists in his belief that the behaviour\nof industry and scientific experiment constitutes praxis in the dialectical,\nphilosophical sense. In fact, scientific experiment is contemplation at its\npurest. The experimenter creates an artificial, abstract milieu in order to be\nable to observe undisturbed the untrammelled workings of the laws under\nexamination.... (Lukács 1971: 132) The problem is obvious: if a laboratory\nexperiment is understood as the dialectical practice, as Engels seems to\nbelieve, its application to society would lead to a mechanistic understanding\nof the objective law of history. Especially in capitalism, because the thing-\nlike character of human relations appears as ‘second nature’, the method of\nnatural science can be easily expanded to include the social realm, producing\nthe positivist view of society. Even if Engels cautioned against the\novergeneralization of this type of dialectics, this misleading type of\ndialectics predominated more and more as a method for analysing society and\nhistory within Orthodox Marxism. This is why Lukács rejected Engels’s\ndialectics of nature as a tool for critical social analysis.\n\nLukács’s defence of the existence of dialectics of nature in _Tailism and the\nDialectic_ must be disappointing to Western Marxists. Yet nor is Lukács’s\ncritique of Engels pleasant to those who want to defend the usefulness of\nEngels’s dialectics of nature. Paul Burkett thus argues that Lukács continued\nto assume ‘scientific dualism’, which highlights the neutrality and\nobjectivity of modern natural science, while degrading the epistemological\nstatus of social science: ‘Lukács slides into the view that natural science\nitself is “more objective”, and therefore less _internally problematical_ than\nsocial science’ (Burkett [2001] 2013: 8; emphasis in original). There are,\naccording to Burkett, still paradoxical remarks in _Tailism and the Dialectic_\nthat only make sense if we do not assume Lukács accepted scientific dualism.\n\nAs seen earlier, Lukács did have a critique of the ideological character of\nmodern natural science, even when he acknowledged the objective character\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n86 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ of natural laws. Is this ambiguous? For Vogel\nand Burkett, the answer is ‘yes’.\n\nHowever, there is one key concept in _Tailism and the Dialectic_ to which they\ndo not pay attention, namely ‘metabolism’. Strangely enough, Burkett, despite\nhis usual inspiring focus on the concept of ‘metabolism’ in his careful\ntreatment of Marx’s ecology (Burkett 1999), hardly pays attention to Lukács’s\nconcept of ‘metabolism’. However, one should recall the fact that Lukács’s\n‘subjective intention’ was not correctly understood in _History and Class\nConsciousness_ at the time, and this is why he felt the need to go back to\nMarx’s _Capital_ and to introduce this concept of ‘metabolism’ in _Tailism and\nthe Dialectic_ in order to more clearly express his intentions. It is unfair\nto attribute ‘scientific dualism’\n\nto Lukács without discussing his key concept of ‘metabolism’.\n\n\n## **iii**\n\n### **lukács’s theory of MetabolisM aNd**\n\n\n## **oNtological MoNisM**\n\nThe general assessment of Lukács’s theory of ‘metabolism’ is not necessarily\nhigh. Other important eco-Marxists such as Brett Clark and John Bellamy\nFoster, for example, write that ‘in the 1920s, Lukacs emphasized the\n“metabolic interaction with nature” through labor as a key to Marx’s dialectic\nof nature and society. He did not, however, go any further’ (Clark and Foster\n2010: 124).\n\nThis statement is misleading as Lukács did go further. In fact, the concept of\nmetabolism continued to play a central role in his work right up until his\nlast unpublished manuscript from the 1960s, _Ontology of Social Being._ 10\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the concept of metabolism originates in Marx’s\n_Capital._ Humans can only live on this planet through their incessant\nmetabolic interaction with nature mediated by labour. Obviously, this is a\ntranshistorical, general condition for human survival (as it is, of course,\nfor other animals), but even this abstract comprehension of human metabolism\nalready highlights two things. First, there is something peculiar about the\nhuman labour process. Certainly, humans are part of nature, and consciousness\nis a product of biological evolution, but Marx argued that the conscious and\nteleological activities of human labour indicate an essential difference from\nother animals whose metabolism with nature is largely predetermined by\ninstinct and a given natural environment. Only humans can relate to extra-\nhuman nature by reflecting upon their objective conditions as well as their\nsubjective desires, which brings about much more dynamic transformations of\nproduction in the long run.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 87\n\nThis leads to the second unique quality of human metabolism with nature.\n\nAccording to Lukács, this transhistorical process is modified by the\nincreasing\n\n‘predominance of the social element’ (Lukács 2002: 99). This is because labour\nis not only a transhistorical physiological activity but also a _social_\nactivity.\n\nThe concrete ways of carrying out labour are conditioned not only by natural\nconditions, whose laws cannot be arbitrarily modified by humans, but also by\nsocial relations. It is this ‘double determination’ of the labour process that\nMarx highlighted: ‘From the specific form of material production arises in the\nfirst place a specific structure of society, in the second place a specific\nrelation of men to nature’ (Lukács 2002: 100; _MECW_ 31: 182). With the\ndevelopment of productive forces, natural-ecological processes of metabolism\nbetween humans and nature are more and more mediated in a socio-historical\nmanner by means of the social division of labour, cooperation, communication\nand various social norms, laws and institutions.\n\nIn this context, Lukács argued that human knowledge is subsequently\nconditioned by metabolic interaction with nature: ‘Since human life is based\non a metabolism with nature, it goes without saying that certain truths which\nwe acquire in the process of carrying out this metabolism have a general\nvalidity\n\n– for example the truths of mathematics, geometry, physics, and so on’ (Lukács\n1975: 43). Knowledge of nature is indispensable in order to successfully\nrealize the teleological activity of labour. Especially, in the earlier stages\nof human history, when human metabolism was still heavily determined by given\nnatural conditions, human knowledge was largely prescribed by the need to\nsatisfy basic needs. In this sense, the content of scientific discoveries are\nalso social products of human metabolism with nature. In other words,\nknowledge of nature is not only materially but also socially and historically\nmediated in the process of human metabolism with nature, even if the objective\ndialectics of nature exist independently of and prior to humans on an\nontological level:\n\n‘Our knowledge of nature is socially mediated, because its material foundation\nis socially mediated’ (Lukács 2002: 106). This is what Lukács meant in the\nfootnote in _History and Class Consciousness_ when he claimed that _our\nknowledge_ _of nature is not independent of but inevitably belongs to the_\n‘realms of history and society’ ( _historisch-soziale Wirklichkeit_), so they\nmust be objects of the dialectics of society. This is also why ‘nature is a\nsocial category’.\n\nIn fact, Lukács already wrote in _History and Class Consciousness_ : From this\nwe deduce the necessity of separating the _merely_ objective dialectics of\nnature from those of society. For in the dialectics of society the subject is\nincluded in the reciprocal relation in which theory and practice become\ndialectical with reference to one another. (It goes without saying that the\ngrowth of _knowledge_ about nature is a social\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n88 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ phenomenon and therefore to be included in the\nsecond dialectical type.) (Lukács 1971: 207; emphasis added)\n\nEven if the dialectics of nature exist prior to humans, their knowledge about\nnature cannot be treated as if it could exist independently of human praxis.\nIn this sense, there is no ‘scientific dualism’ between social and natural\nscience. It is possible to investigate the underlying social relations of\nmodern natural science without discarding its objectivity. It is this type of\nsocial dialectical knowledge of nature that must be distinguished from\nEngels’s objective dialectics of nature, which he often describes as a process\nindependent of humans. Engels’s project is ‘merely’ descriptive of that which\nexists independently of human metabolism with nature and of social factors. In\nLukács’s opinion, Engels’s lack of a theory of metabolism meant he did not\nsufficiently integrate the social aspects into the dialectical development of\nthe knowledge of nature. This is what Lukács wanted to say in his\ncontroversial footnote and he clarified the point in _Tailism and the\nDialectic_ : ‘Our consciousness of nature, in other words our knowledge of\nnature, is determined by our social being. This is what I have said in the few\nobservations that I have devoted to this question; nothing less, but nothing\nmore’ (Lukács 2002: 100).11\n\nSuch emphasis on sociality and historicity of human metabolism with nature\nalso marks a clear contrast with the self-understanding of modern natural\nscience characterized by the ‘contemplative attitude’. Of course, Lukács did\nnot deny the possibility of obtaining objective and universally valid\nknowledge of nature through the method of modern natural science.12\nNevertheless, the ‘contemplative attitude’ conceals the fact that knowledge of\nnature is mediated by social metabolism with nature; in other words, it\nforgets its own social foundation in the ‘capitalist society, whose metabolism\nwith nature forms the material basis of modern natural science’\n\n(Lukács 2002: 114). Due to this reification, that is, forgetfulness, of social\nrelations, humans come to treat nature simply as an independent existence that\nis immediately accessible and manipulable through natural science, turning it\ninto a bourgeois ideology.\n\nIn Lukács’s opinion, it is the modern scientific worldview that falls into the\n‘dualism’ of nature and history: in the modern scientific worldview, anything\nrelated to society is deprived of the true objectivity, while only ahistorical\nobjects in nature that exist independently of society are considered to be\nobjective.13 This is exactly what Lukács attempted to overcome through his\ncritique of the false immediacy of pure ‘facts’, which are an abstraction from\nthe real historical metabolic process between humans and nature. What is\nabstracted here is significant because it constitutes the interplay of the\nsubject and the object, as well as theory and practice in history: ‘Categories\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 89\n\nthat appear today as “eternal”, as categories directly taken from nature, e.g.\n\nwork in physics, are actually historical, determined by the specific\nmetabolism between capitalist society and nature’ (Lukács 2002: 131).14 This\nstatement might give the impression that Lukács is advocating for a social\nconstructivist treatment of knowledge of nature. It is true that Lukács argues\nthat the knowledge of nature must be analysed as a historical product in\nrelation to the socio-historical process of metabolism with nature. However,\nLukács distances himself from relativism, as he explicitly states: ‘The fact\nthat modern natural science is a product of capitalist society takes nothing\naway from its objectivity’\n\n(Lukács 2002: 115). Truth is historical,15 but its content is objective:\nHowever – in as far as it pertains to the objective reality of social being\nand the nature mediated through this – it is objective truth, absolute truth,\nwhich only changes its position, its theoretical explanation, etc., because of\nthe knowledge that ‘overcomes’ it, and which is more comprehensive and more\ncorrect. (Lukács 2002: 105)\n\nTo sum up, Lukács did not argue for ‘scientific dualism’. By contrast, he\nconsistently highlighted that the transformation of our knowledge of nature is\ntightly linked to the transformation in the constellation of the social\nbeings, which always changes with the socio-historical development of\nmetabolism with nature. As Feenberg (2017: 132) puts it, ‘Knowledge of nature,\nlike social knowledge, is dialectical.’ By highlighting this point, Lukács was\narguing for the establishment of a new dialectical conception beyond the\ndivision of social science and natural science. This would require a critical\nanalysis of the categories and methods of natural sciences in relation to\nconcrete human metabolism with nature, which is mediated not only by material\nconditions but also by social relations such as class, gender and race. This\nis exactly what Burkett demands by transcending scientific dualism.\n\nHowever, this is not the end of the story. What is more, Lukács’s concept of\nmetabolism is also essential to avoid the ‘ontological dualism’ that Rudas and\nVogel ascribe to Lukács. Ontological dualism is founded upon the absolute\nseparation between Society and Nature – so-called Cartesian dualism. Yet the\nMarxian concept of ‘metabolism’ emphasizes their incessant interchange\nmediated by human labour. Humans are without doubt a part of nature. To put it\ndifferently, they are a part of the incessant flow and flux of the universal\nmetabolism of nature. This view is incompatible with Cartesian dualism.\n\nAs Kate Soper points out, Cartesian dualism confronts a difficulty in terms of\nexplaining how the two fully separated substances – ‘mind’ and ‘body’ in\nDescartes, and now ‘the social’ and ‘the natural’ – interact with each other:\n‘To accept the Cartesian picture is simply to accept that there exist two\nutterly https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n90 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ different kinds of substance…, and that they\nmiraculously but inexplicably operate continuously upon each other’ (Soper\n1995: 43–4). Vogel’s monist alternative is compelling only when we assume that\nLukács embraced the Cartesian dualism of Nature and Society. Yet the basic\ninsight of Lukács’s theory of metabolism is an ontological monism that\nrecognizes the continuity of humans and extra-human nature in the biophysical\nprocesses of the universal metabolism of nature. Humans and non-human nature\nare mediated by labour and intertwined. There is no absolute separation, so\nthe accusation of Cartesian dualism directed against Marxism is a strawman\nargument.\n\nOn the other hand, Vogel’s idea of social constructivism of nature is\ncounterintuitive. The fact that nature is affected by the social does not mean\nthat nature is socially constructed. For example, even if X is affected by\nsocial practice, this fact alone does not make X a social construct. Likewise,\nnature undergoes constant changes through labour, so there is no ‘pure’\npristine nature. However, this obvious fact alone does not turn nature into a\nsocial construct. There still exists a natural substance, upon which the\nsocial works.\n\nSimilarly, nature cannot be simply resolved into a social category by the\nsingle fact that nature is affected by labour or that the knowledge of natural\nscience is discovered through a set of social practices in the laboratory. As\nMauricio Ferraris points out, such a discussion confuses the ontological and\nepistemological dimension (Ferraris 2014: 33). After all, nature is not\nproduced in the same way as a watch is produced through labour. Ironically, it\nis the advocates of post-Cartesian monism that presuppose Cartesian dualism.\n\nThey tacitly separate the two entities in a dualist manner, so that humans\ntouching it would immediately make nature a social construct.\n\nSince Lukács rejected Cartesian dualism, he did not argue for a flat ontology\neither. While he insisted on the unity of the social and the natural in the\nconstant process of metabolism between society and nature, Lukács did not\nforget to add that there are ‘new, equally objective forms of movements’\n\n(Lukács 2002: 102) that exist _only_ in certain social conditions – so-called\nsocial beings. In other words, he emphasized the _qualitative_ difference of\nthe purely social that emerges in the metabolic process of the entanglement of\nsociety and nature without negating their continuity. This historical\ninterrelation and entanglement in the process of metabolism is the fundamental\ninsight of Lukács’s ‘historical materialism’. Historical materialism makes it\nclear that there is a fundamental unity in the natural, ecological process of\nmetabolic interchange between humans and nature (‘materialism’), whose actual\nprocesses and appearances are, however, always already socio-historically\nmediated and evolve accordingly (‘historical’).16\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 91\n\nIn fact, in another unpublished manuscript, _Ontology of Social Being_ , the\nlate Lukács claimed that there is a qualitative ‘leap’ ( _Sprung_) between the\nrealm of nature and the realm of society (Lukács 1984: 169). Although society\n‘arises’\n\nfrom nature, there are new, qualitatively different properties in the realm of\nthe social emerging from social relations mediated by human language, social\nlabour and other activities. These emergent properties bring about radically\nnew dimensions in the process of human metabolism with nature. Thus, it is\nnecessary to carefully investigate these qualitatively different ‘social\nforms’\n\nin order to reveal the historical uniqueness of social beings under\ncapitalism.\n\nFor example, the ‘value’ of a desk as a commodity is a ‘purely social’\nproperty that attains a universal form only in capitalism, but it is as\nobjective as its brown colour, even if you cannot touch or see value as a\nsensible property of the desk ( _Capital_ I: 139). Indeed, what is produced\nthrough social relations attains objective social power and the appearance of\nagency, even confronting humans as an alien force: ‘The direct forms of\nappearance of social beings are not, however, subjective fantasies of the\nbrain, but moments of the real forms of existence’ (Lukács 2002: 79).\n\nIn short, _both_ ‘continuity’ and ‘break’ ( _Bruch_) exist in the course of\nthe historical development of human metabolism with nature. In order to\nexpress this complex relationship between society and nature, Lukács borrowed\nan expression from Hegel, calling this differentiated unity of society and\nnature in their incessant metabolism the ‘identity of identity and non-\nidentity’\n\n(Lukács 1984: 395): humans are a part of nature and embedded in the universal\nmetabolism of nature (‘identity’) but at the same time distinguished due to\nnew qualitatively distinct emergent properties of society that do not exist in\nextra-human nature (‘non-identity’). These two aspects exist together in\nreality as ‘identity’ or ‘unity-in-separation’.17 This ‘identity of identity\nand non-identity’ is the key to differentiate Lukács’s view from those of both\nflat ontology and social constructivism.18 With the ‘identity of identity and\nnon-identity’ between nature and society in mind, one can argue that a\nscientism that privileges the neutral objectivity of natural science places\ntoo much emphasis on the _discontinuity_ (non-identity) between nature and\nsociety, thus falling into Cartesian and scientific dualism. Social\nconstructivism, on the other hand, depends too much on the sameness and\n_continuity_(identity) between society and nature, missing new, purely social\nqualities, so it is unable to reveal the uniqueness of the capitalist way of\norganizing human metabolism with their environment. This insight into Lukács’s\nmethodology is necessary to understand his theory of ‘crisis’.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n92 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ **iv**\n\n**towards lukács’s theory of crisis as a critique** **of ecological crisis**\n\nIn contrast to today’s dominant monist flat ontology that tends to erase the\ndistinction between society and nature, Lukács consistently argued for\nanalysing the ‘double determination’ of metabolism between humans and nature\nwhich is socio-historical as well as natural-ecological. He adopted a more\nnuanced description of the metabolic relationship of society and nature based\non unity-in-separation by suggesting we ‘consider this metabolism with nature\nin its double determination, as much as an interaction with nature – which\nexists independently from humans – as well as simultaneously determined by the\neconomic structure of society at any one time’ (Lukács 2002: 113).\n\nLukács’s point is that the natural and the social are obviously entangled in\nreality, but this does not mean that they need not be distinguished. On the\ncontrary, it is all the more essential to distinguish them and to analyse\ntheir unique determinations by the capitalist economic structure. This is the\nonly way the historically unique character of capitalist production becomes\ncomprehensible. It is in this particular sense of paying attention to the\ndimension of purely social forms that Lukács’s _analytical_ distinction of\nnature and society plays an essential role. However, this methodological\ndualism is radically different from the one that Steven Vogel characterizes as\nLukács’s dualist method because Lukács does not presuppose ontological dualism\nof Society and Nature.19\n\nLukács’s ‘methodological dualism’ is close to Alf Hornborg’s analytical\nseparation of the natural and the social. Hornborg argues for a dualist\nmethodology precisely because nature is subsumed into the social in the\nAnthropocene:\n\nBut does this mean the categories of Nature and Culture, or Nature and\nSociety, are obsolete and should be discarded? On the contrary, never has it\nbeen more imperative to maintain an _analytical_ distinction between the\nsymbolic and the pre-symbolic, while acknowledging their complex interfusion\nin the real world. Only by keeping Society and Nature _analytically_ apart can\nwe hope to progress in the demystification of that hybrid web in which we are\nall suspended. (Hornborg 2012: 34) In contrast to Vogel, who ends up arguing\nfor both methodological and ontological monism, Hornborg maintains that an\n‘analytical dualism’ is all the more important for critical theory in the age\nof hybridity. Andreas Malm (2018: 53) makes a similar distinction between\n‘substance monism’ – equivalent to ‘ontological monism’ – and ‘property\ndualism’. Even though the social and https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 93\n\nthe natural belong to the same ontological level and share the same substance,\ntheir properties are different like ‘mind’ and ‘body’, so it is necessary to\nanalyse them separately. Only based on this separation can one reject the\nfetish view that accepts the appearance of hybridity as given.\n\nWhile the analytical separation of society and nature gains a critical\nfunction in the Anthropocene,20 it is not sufficient for Lukács. In Lukács’s\nHegelian terminology, he advocated taking the dimension of the ‘totality’\n\ninto account. In fact, the ‘identity of identity and non-identity’ is nothing\nbut young Hegel’s expression for the absolute. While emphasizing the double\ndetermination of the natural and the social, Lukács claimed that the natural\nand the social must not remain separated all the time, as they never exist\nseparately in reality, but only in the ‘identity of identity and non-\nidentity’. In fact, Marx also argued that social forms cannot exist without a\nmaterial ‘bearer’ ( _Träger_): ‘Value is independent of the particular use-\nvalue by which it is borne, but a use-value of some kind has to act as its\nbearer’\n\n( _Capital_ I: 295). A prominent example in _Capital_ is money. Its function\nas the\n\n‘general equivalent form’ is something purely social, but it requires gold as\nits bearer. As a result, gold as money is a classic example of the hybridity\nof the social and the natural in capitalism, resulting in fetish. In order to\navoid the fetish confusion of the social and the natural, it is first\nanalytically necessary to comprehend the logic of ‘value-form’. In the reified\nworld, however, the purely social power of ‘commodity’, ‘money’ and ‘capital’\nsubsume their material bearers and transform the entire world according to the\nlogic of capital’s valorization. Only through comprehending this tension of\n‘unity-in-separation’\n\n(Holloway and Picciotto 1978: 3) or ‘unity-in-opposition of nature and\nsociety’ (Napoletano et al. 2019: 8) is it possible to treat the natural and\nthe social in their relation to the dynamic process of the historical\ndevelopment of the capitalist mode of production.\n\nAfter comprehending the importance of this analytical separation _and_\ncombination of the social and the natural, one can understand Lukács’s true\nintention in his critique of the ‘immediacy’ that is characteristic of the\nmodern\n\n‘contemplative attitude’. As seen earlier, Lukács pointed to the need to\nanalyse the mediated character of natural science, but this mediatedness also\nneeds to be understood as a double determination. Vogel only pays attention to\none of these aspects, falling into a social constructivism of nature.\n\nOn the one hand, _the natural is mediated by the social._ Behind the\ndevelopment of natural sciences, there exist social relations that constitute\na historically particular way of organizing the metabolism between humans and\nnature. Under the capitalist mode of production, this metabolism is obviously\ndriven by capital’s infinite drive for valorization. Accordingly, this process\nof subsumption of nature under capital brings about the ‘rationalization’ of\nthe https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n94 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ production process based on quantification and\nmechanization and later of the entire social sphere, so even human beings are\ntreated like things. This reversal of the subject and the object is what Marx\ncriticized as ‘reification’\n\n( _Versachlichung_). On the other hand, _the social is mediated by the\nnatural._\n\nLukács sees the second problem of reification in the fact that such a process\nof quantification of the world forgets the mediation by ‘matter’ (\n_Materie_).21\n\nIn other words, the dimension of the ‘material’ always persists despite its\nhistorical modifications under certain social relations because social ‘forms’\n\nalways require their ‘bearers’. They cannot be simply reduced to pure social\nconstructions and total quantification. Nature persists. What is more, the\nrelationship between economic form and matter is asymmetrical: the latter can\nexist without the former, but _not vice versa._ This is exactly why the\nformalism of modern capitalism that tendentially erases the non-identity of\nnature as capital’s bearers ultimately results in serious contradictions.\n\nNow it becomes clear that Lukács did not simply praise the modern natural\nsciences as more objective and neutral than the social sciences. By contrast,\nhe consistently problematized the formalism of reified natural science because\nits contemplative attitude cannot fully take into account the non-identity of\nnature due to its ‘indifference of form towards content’ (Lukács 1971: 126).\n\nThis has an important ecological implication.22\n\nAs the totalizing tendency of capital strengthens itself with the development\nof capitalism, its contradiction crystalizes as ‘crisis’. Everything,\nincluding human and non-human nature, is commodified, through which the value-\nform is uniformly imposed upon the various products of labour. Total\nquantification through the value-form is representative of identity-thinking,\nwhich suppresses non-identity of material world by reducing the differences of\nvarious use-values and imposing an abstract measure of value. Under the\ntotalizing logic of commodification, nature is reduced to a mere vehicle for\ncapital’s valorization without acknowledgement of its own independent\npurposiveness. Erasing the distinction between the social and the natural is\n‘a recipe for hubris’ (Henning 2020: 306) that leads to techno-optimist\ninterventions in the natural environment. As long as the formal and\nreductionist approach characterized by identity-thinking persists in the\nreified world, the material is increasingly marginalized: This rational\nobjectification conceals above all the immediate qualitative and material-\ncharacter of things as things. When use-values appear universally as\ncommodities they acquire a new objectivity, a new substantiality which they\ndid not possess in an age of episodic exchange and which destroys their\noriginal and authentic substantiality.\n\n(Lukács 1971: 92)23\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 95\n\nWhen non-identity is reduced to identity in the course of the\ninstrumentalization of non-human nature, the process of quantification becomes\nmore and more violent. However, the non-identity of nature persists in\nreality. The natural world exceeds our full grasp, and it cannot be fully\ncontrolled, often resulting in unforeseen hazards precisely due to our\nintentional actions.24 This contradiction ultimately manifests itself as\n‘crisis’, which Lukács formulated in the following way:\n\nThis rationalisation of the world appears to be complete, it seems to\npenetrate the very depths of man’s physical and psychic nature. It is limited,\nhowever, by its own formalism. That is to say, the rationalisation of isolated\naspects of life results in the creation of-formal-laws. All these things do\njoin together into what seems to the superficial observer to constitute a\nunified system of general ‘laws’. But the disregard of the concrete aspects of\nthe subject matter of these laws, upon which disregard their authority as laws\nis based, makes itself felt in the incoherence of the system in fact. This\nincoherence becomes particularly egregious in periods of crisis. At such times\nwe can see how the immediate continuity between two partial systems is\ndisrupted and their independence from and adventitious connection with each\nother is suddenly forced into the consciousness of everyone. (Lukács 1971:\n101)\n\nSince modern rationalization driven by natural science inevitably creates\ntension with the material dimension of the world as its bearer, the\nrationality of formal laws adds up to the ‘relative irrationality of the total\nprocess’\n\n(Lukács 1971: 102). In the moment of crisis, the interdependence of each\nfactor within the totality of the system becomes manifest in a way that\nformalism can neither adequately anticipate nor handle. No matter how much\nproductive forces and technologies develop, warned Lukács, it is impossible to\ncontinue suppressing the qualitative side of the natural world. Its non-\nidentity explodes in periods of crisis. This ultimately poses a serious threat\nto human prosperity. After all, human beings are natural beings, and the\n‘biological basis of life remains the same even in society’ (Lukács 1986: 91).\nEcological crisis as a metabolic rift is the ‘crisis’ in Lukács’s sense.\n\nLukács’s realist account of historical materialism combined both dimensions of\nthe social and the natural by bringing them into unity, without falling into\ndualism. In doing so, he called for establishing a new dialectical science\nthat takes into account both dimensions for the sake of establishing a more\nsustainable society beyond capitalism. However, this ‘subjective intention’ of\nthe early Lukács was poorly understood at the time and later neglected.\nRevisiting Lukács’s dualist method and his theory of crisis is more important\nthan ever today. However, there is currently a general popularity\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n96 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ of monist views that accept the hybridity of\nthe natural and the social. It is worth re-examining the validity and the\nsuperiority of monism from a Marxist perspective. Upon closer examination, it\nbecomes clear that Marx’s methodological dualism provides a more powerful tool\nnot only to analyse the ecological crisis but also to envision a post-\ncapitalist future beyond the crisis of the Anthropocene.\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nIn this way, István Mészáros, who was Lukács’s colleague, was able to\nintegrate Marx’s theory of metabolic rift into his own theory at a very early\nstage by recognizing the need for a critique of capital’s ‘ultimately\nuncontrollable mode of social metabolic control’ (Mészáros 1995: 41).\n\n2 Another fundamental characteristic of Western Marxism is its recourse to\nHegel’s philosophy. This also plays an important role in the second half of\nthis chapter.\n\n3\n\nVogel is not alone here. In the face of these theoretical ambiguities, Andrew\nArato and Paul Breines conclude that Lukács’s extension of his sociological\ncritique of reification to all sciences is ‘less convincing, given his\ndifficulties with\n\n“nature”’ (Arato and Breines 1979: 121). Andrew Feenberg (1981: 204) also\njudges that ‘Lukács does not have a fully coherent theory of either nature or\nnatural science’.\n\n4\n\nSee Vogel (2015: 44–5):\n\nThe environment is socially constructed; society is environmentally\nconstructed. Humanity and the environment cannot be separated from each other\n– a conclusion that does _not_ mean that we are masters of the world, or that\nit masters us either, but rather that ‘world’ and ‘we’ are so deeply\ninterconnected that there is no way to tell where one leaves off and the other\nbegins.\n\n5\n\nThis tendency continues today. Axel Honneth (2008) typically reduces the\nentire theoretical relevancy of Lukács’s theory of reification to the problem\nof mutual recognition and its forgetfulness.\n\n6 The German title _Chvostismus_ originates from a Russian term that Lenin\nemployed in _What Is to Be Done?_ (Löwy 2013: 69). Lukács aimed to criticize\nthose Marxists who passively follow – ‘tail-ending’ – the objective course of\nhistory that proceeds independently of human consciousness.\n\n7\n\nThis fact alone is quite interesting when compared with previous literature.\n\nArato and Breines (1979: 190) maintained that Lukács already in 1924–6 went\nthrough a ‘substantial shift’ with regard to his earlier position made in\n_History_ _and Class Consciousness_. However, this is not the case, and he\nstill defended his earlier view at the time.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 97\n\n8\n\nFor the relationship between Rudas and Lukács, see Congdon (2007). The English\ntranslation of Rudas’s work is based upon Lukács (2002).\n\n9\n\nRudas wrote: ‘Denn in diesem Sinne ist die Industrie ein ewiger Naturprozeß\nzwischen Mensch und Natur, in dem der Mensch seinen Stoffwechsel mit der Natur\nvermittelt. (Marx. Kapital. I. 140).’\n\n10 This last work of Lukács was neglected and even ‘despised’ for quite a long\ntime because even ‘Lukács’s students fought to boycott the project because\nthey preferred _History and Class Consciousness_ ’ (Infranca and Vedda 2020:\n16). Foster is also aware that Lukács kept employing the concept until the\n1960s, making his dismissal appear rather strange.\n\n11 Lukács repeated the same point in another passage in _Tailism and the\nDialectic_ : That objective dialectics are in reality independent of humans\nand were there before the emergence of the people, is precisely what was\nasserted in this passage; but that for thinking the dialectic, for the\ndialectic as knowledge (and that and that alone was addressed in the remark),\nthinking people are necessary. (Lukács 2002: 107) 12 It is absurd to\ncharacterize _History and Class Consciousness_ as ‘the first major irruption\nof the romantic anti-scientific tradition’ into Marxism (Jones 1971: 44).\n\n13 Rudas is actually the one who fell into Cartesian dualism, when he\ncriticized Lukács’s footnote that the absolute separation of society and\nnature actually results in dualism and subjectivism. He only regarded ‘subject\n= human (society)’ and ‘object = nature’, so any product of ‘the socio-\nhistorical process of development’ becomes ‘subjective’, while only those\nthings that are independent from the ‘historical process of the social\ndevelopment’ can be seen as possessing\n\n‘true objectivity’. Consequently, all social forms are treated as merely\nsubjective under Rudas’ methodology. This inflexible separation is responsible\nfor a mechanistic understanding of nature that supposes the eternal\nobjectivity of nature.\n\n14 It was Herbert Marcuse who correctly grasped Lukács’s point without knowing\n_Tailism and the Dialectic_ and linked the _historische Wirklichkeit_ and\n_Stoffwechsel_ when he wrote:\n\nIf the Marxian dialectic is in its conceptual structure a dialectic of the\nhistorical reality, then it includes nature in so far as the latter is itself\npart of the historical reality [ _historische Wirklichkeit_] (in the metabolic\ninteraction [ _Stoffwechsel_] between man and nature, the domination and\nexploitation of nature, nature as ideology, etc.). But precisely in so far as\nnature is investigated in abstraction from these historical relations, as in\nthe natural sciences, it seems to lie outside the realm of dialectic.\n\n(Marcuse 1958: 143–4)\n\n15 Lukács’s favourite example is the affinity between Darwin’s theory of\nnatural selection and the endless atomistic competition in the modern market\nsociety, https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n98 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ an example which is borrowed from Marx’s own\nremark in his letter to Engels dated 18 June 1862:\n\nI’m amused that Darwin, at whom I’ve been taking another look, should say that\nhe also applies the ‘Malthusian’ theory to plants and animals, as though in\nMr. Malthus’s case the whole thing didn’t lie in its not being applied to\nplants and animals, but only – with its geometric progression –\n\nto humans as against plants and animals. It is remarkable how Darwin\nrediscovers, among the beasts and plants, the society of England with its\ndivision of labour, competition, opening up of new markets, ‘inventions’\n\nand Malthusian ‘struggle for existence’. It is Hobbes’ _bellum omnium_ _contra\nomnes_ and is reminiscent of Hegel’s Phenomenology, in which civil society\nfigures as an ‘intellectual animal kingdom’, whereas, in Darwin, the animal\nkingdom figures as civil society. ( _MECW_ 41: 381) 16 This is different from\nJacob Moleschott’s understanding of the (vulgar) materialist theory of\nmetabolism, which reduces everything to the eternal cycle of matter ( _Stoff_)\nand thus deprives materialism of any _historical_ dimension (Saito 2017: 84).\n\n17 The term was originally used for analysing the relationship between the\neconomic and the political in the state debate (Holloway and Picciotto 1978:\n3).\n\nThis conception adequately grasps the unique methodology of Marx’s critique of\npolitical economy.\n\n18 Honneth’s critique of Lukács’s ‘idealism’ that ‘mind and world coincide\nwith one another’ (Honneth 2008: 27) misses this point.\n\n19 Andrew Feenberg (2017: 121) adequately argues: ‘The problem he addressed\nwith the contrast between natural scientific study of nature and society is a\nmethodological one. It was not intended to institute a dualism of nature and\nsociety generally but only to preclude the application of natural scientific\nmethods to the social world.’ Feenberg (2015: 234) also cautions that critics,\nconfounding the nature appropriated in the labour process with the nature of\nnatural science, render ‘Lukacs’s methodological distinction of nature and\nsociety far more substantive than Lukacs himself intended’, turning it into an\nontological one. Here Feenberg apparently changed his earlier view that Lukács\nhad a ‘real contradiction’ due to this ‘methodological split between history\nand nature’. He had previously argued that as long as such a split exists,\nLukács’s idealist goal of ‘a “heroic rationalism” that accepts no boundaries’\ncan never be achieved (Feenberg 1981: 210–11). Such a reconstruction of the\nGerman idealist tradition, as if Hegel attempted to dissolve the entire world\ninto the spirit, sounds absurd, and it is also nonsense to assume that Lukács\nfollowed such a path.\n\n20 This issue will be discussed in the next chapter.\n\n21 Marx himself distinguished between two aspects of the English term\n‘reification’.\n\nHe actually used two terms _Versachlichung_ and _Verdinglichung.\nVersachlichung_ expresses the inversion of the subject and the object, while\n_Verdinglichung_ is https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online\nby Cambridge University Press\n\n_Lukács’s Theory of Metabolism as the Foundation of Ecosocialist Realism_ | 99\n\nthe fusion of the economic form and its material bearer. The latter can thus\nbe translated as ‘thingification’.\n\n22 _History and Class Consciousness_ is marked by the Hegelian positive view\nof the totality, according to which the proletariat is assumed to realize the\nabsolute unity of the subject and the object. In such a theoretical scheme,\neven the unity and reconciliation of society and nature can be established\nbeyond the modern alienation from nature. It is problematic to assume such a\nromantic reconciliation of society and nature, and this is why Theodor W.\nAdorno ([1966] 1990) correctly emphasized the ‘non-identity’ of the subject\nand the object, as well as of society and nature. The late Lukács increasingly\ndistanced himself from his earlier position in _History and Class\nConsciousness_ and came to emphasize the irreducible non-identity of nature.\n\n23 In\n\n_Tailism and the Dialectic_ , Lukács repeated the same point: ‘But [the\nimpartial attitude towards nature by natural scientists] does make it\nimpossible for them to interpret the contradictions that arise in concrete\nmaterial as dialectical contradictions…, in their connection to the totality,\nas moments of a unified historical process’ (Lukács 2002: 118).\n\n24 Ecomodernism is another example of eliminating the non-identity of nature,\nas discussed in Chapter 5.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.004 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n**Part II**\n\n\n## **a critique of Productive**\n\n**forces iN the age of global**\n\n\n## **ecological crisis**\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n**4**\n\n**Monism and the Non-identity**\n\n\n## **of Nature**\n\nAs discussed in Part I, the concept of metabolism is crucial for a Marxian\nanalysis of the global ecological crisis in the Anthropocene. However,\npersistent criticisms are directed against those eco-Marxists who seek to\ndevelop the concept of metabolic rift. The criticisms have been reinforced\nrecently as those political ecologists who problematize the concept of the\nAnthropocene as an anthropocentric and Eurocentric narrative also maintain\nthat eco-Marxists are not only productivist but also dualist. According to\ncritics, the dualist notions of nature’s ‘revenge’ and ‘metabolic rift’ are\nunable to properly grasp the historical dynamics of ecological crises caused\nby capitalist accumulation.\n\nThis chapter, following Marx’s ecological analysis and method, defends his\necosocialist realism in a non-Cartesian manner against monist conceptions of\nthe world. While many critiques of the Anthropocene narrative are valid, they\ndo not immediately justify the claim that monism is superior to dualism in\nconceptualizing the current ecological crisis (I). The problem of monism\nbecomes particularly visible when investigating influential discourses in\ncurrent environmental geography. Prominent critiques of Cartesian dualism of\nSociety and Nature in the Marxist tradition come from Neil Smith’s\n\n‘production of nature’ and Jason W. Moore’s ‘world-ecology’. Although their\nreconceptualization of the human–nature relationship looks quite radical at\nfirst glance, a series of theoretical difficulties in these monist approaches\nbecome discernible upon closer examination.\n\nThere are obviously significant differences between Smith and Moore.\n\nDavid Harvey’s critique of neo-Malthusianism in the 1970s heavily influenced\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n104 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Smith’s ‘production of nature’ approach.\nTheir fear of Malthusianism, however, made them dissolve real natural limits\ninto a social construction, so both Harvey and Smith were hesitant to\nrecognize the necessity of integrating environmentalism into the Marxian\ncritique of capitalism. In fact, the ‘production of nature’ approach is\nhaunted by an illegitimate kind of anthropocentrism, which undermines nature’s\nindependence and autonomy as non-identical with society. Consequently, they\nended up underestimating the impact of the global ecological crisis under\ncapitalism (II).\n\nIn contrast, Moore’s treatment of the ecological crisis is characterized by a\ndetermined negation of anthropocentrism. Through his monist concept of\n_oikeios_ , he denounces advocates of ‘metabolic rift’ for falling into a\n‘Cartesian dualism’ of Society and Nature. He maintains that his theory of\n‘world-ecology’\n\noffers a more fertile way to combine Marx’s ecology with his political economy\nthan does the Metabolic Rift School that is characterized by dualism (III). In\ndefence of the Marxian concept of ‘metabolic rift’, this chapter clarifies\nMarx’s intention to strictly distinguish society and nature in _Capital_ ,\neven though Moore claims that his own post-Cartesian view is more loyal to\nMarx’s philosophical framework. However, Moore’s treatment of the key passage\nof _Capital_ is too hasty. He incorrectly identifies Marx’s expressions of\n‘rift’\n\nand ‘separation’ with Cartesian dualism and suppresses them. This omission\nindicates Moore’s failure to fully appreciate Marx’s dualist methodology\nimplied in his discussion of ‘irreparable rift’ (IV).\n\nSince Moore abandons the concept of ‘rift’, his theory of capitalist crisis\nnarrowly focuses on the _economic_ crisis of capital’s valorization due to the\n‘end of Cheap Nature’, a concept akin to James O’Connor’s ‘second\ncontradiction of capitalism’. In contrast, Marx was concerned with the issue\nof the _ecological_ crisis from an ‘anthropocentric’ perspective because he\nconsistently recognized the ‘non-identity’ of nature (V). Finally, it is not\naccidental that the monist understanding of the society–nature relationship\nunderestimates the ecological crisis precisely because it marginalizes this\nnon-identity of nature. Consequently, it risks falling into an ecomodernist\nvision of geo-constructivism to create the ‘good Anthropocene’ by justifying\nfurther technological intervention in the name of stewardship of the Earth\nsystem (VI).\n\n\n## **i**\n\n**aNthroPoceNe, caPitaloceNe or techNoceNe?**\n\nThe concept of the Anthropocene has become popular in the last decade, but it\nhas inevitably been subject to various criticisms. Andreas Malm and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 105\n\nAlf Hornborg (2014), for example, point to the possible fallacy of ‘fetishism’\n\nin the Anthropocene narrative. According to them, there is a tendency in\nAnthropocene narratives to identify the ultimate cause of today’s\nenvironmental catastrophe in ancient causes like the ‘use of fire’ (Raupach\nand Canadell 2010: 211). In this framework, the ecological crisis was set in\ntrain once our ancestors started to use fire to dominate nature. Such a\ndiscourse attributes the origin of today’s ecological crisis to a certain\n‘essential’ trait of human beings.\n\nIt abstracts from the social relations that largely determine how humans\nrelate to nature and who are most responsible in this process. Consequently,\nsuch an essentialist view prevents us from investigating the ecological crises\nin relation to the modern social system of capitalism and its specific\nrelations of power, capital, hegemony and technology.1\n\nSighard Neckel (2021: 138) also criticizes the way the term ‘Anthropocene’\n\ntreats human species as the single subject of planetary transformation and\nconceals economic inequality under capitalism. The _Anthropos_ that is\nresponsible for the ecological crisis is an abstract concept, which is\nactually nothing but an idealist fiction. Geographical, economic and political\ninequalities in the emission of greenhouse gas clearly indicate that humans as\nsuch are by no means responsible for the global climate change. In reality,\nthose who are most responsible for the current situation are people with a\nhigh income living in the Global North. The negative consequences of climate\nchange are unevenly distributed to the poor and marginalized in the Global\nSouth who lack the financial and technological means to adjust to it. In\nshort, the current changes in the climate are tightly linked to power\nrelations under the hegemony of global neoliberal capitalism, and reflecting\nupon climate justice requires us to take hierarchies consisting of class, race\nand gender into account. Nevertheless, such an approach is, according to\nNeckel, absent in the dominant Anthropocene narrative that subsumes everyone\nunder the unified entity of human species. Consequently, this master narrative\nof the Anthropocene obscures the constitution of the current status quo\nthrough the violence, oppression and exploitation of capitalism.\n\nFor example, Dipesh Chakrabarty, a prominent historian of the Anthropocene,\navoids a critique of capital by arguing that it ‘is not sufficient for\naddressing questions relating to human history once the crisis of climate\nchange has been acknowledged and the Anthropocene has begun to loom on the\nhorizon of our present’ (Chakrabarty 2009: 212). It is plain enough that this\ninsufficiency does not legitimate his avoidance of a ‘critique of capital’.\n\nThis kind of Anthropocene narrative ‘denaturalizes’ the current ecological\ncrisis by emphasizing human impacts but ultimately only ‘renaturalizes’ it,\nsuch that it cannot critically examine the social relations constituted by\ncapitalism (Malm and Hornborg 2014: 65).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n106 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Without consciously questioning the existing\ncapitalist mode of production and its hierarchies, proponents of the\nAnthropocene often end up aspiring to further technological development and\n‘domination over nature’ as the only solution to the coming ecological\ncatastrophe, all the more because this approach is compatible with capital’s\ndrive to further economic growth.\n\nThey demand the ‘management’ of the Earth system for human survival amid the\ndeepening ecological crisis. For example, Paul Crutzen, the inventor of the\nAnthropocene concept, proposes geo-engineering as a solution to climate\nchange. This technology involves disseminating aerosol sulphate into the\natmosphere to reduce sunlight and cool down the planet (Crutzen 2006: 212).\n\nYet scientific discussions concerning terraforming the earth, no matter how\nrobust they may be on the level of computer calculation, raise ethical\nquestions.\n\nIt is questionable whether elites in developed countries should be allowed to\nmake a political decision that will nevertheless have enormous impacts upon\nthe entire planet, while people who are more likely to experience their\nnegative consequences are excluded from that decision-making process. Without\na democratic process of decision-making, technocratic countermeasures against\nthe ecological crisis from above are likely to reinforce existing inequalities\nand the social divide, leading to ‘ecofacism’ (Gorz 1980: 77) or\n‘technofascism’\n\n(Illich 1977: 14). This is why the Anthropocene narrative is criticized as ‘a\ngrand narrative seeking legitimation for the installation of a global,\npilotable, management machine’ (Neyrat 2019: 9).\n\nAgainst this productivist myth of the Anthropocene, Stefania Barca (2020)\ndeterminedly rejects the Anthropocene narrative. Drawing upon the ecofeminist\ntradition, Barca criticizes the master narrative of the Anthropocene from the\nperspective of ‘forces of reproduction’. In contrast to the instrumental logic\nof capitalist modernization, ‘forces of reproduction’ such as domestic work,\nnursing, subsistence farming and fishing are characterized by the act of\n_caring_ based on the recognition of interdependency with other human and\nnonhuman life. Based on this concept, Barca argues that capitalist development\nand its incessant economic growth are founded on its exploitative dependence\non the unpaid reproductive labour of women, peasants, slaves and indigenous\npeople. The essential contribution of women, non-Europeans, indigenous peoples\nand non-human creatures remain devalued and marginalized today.\n\nThe concept of the Anthropocene does not change this situation. The master\nnarrative reproduces and reinforces the existing relations of domination and\nsubordination due to its tacit acceptance of hierarchical _dualism_ such as\n\n‘human and nature (non-human)’, ‘civilization and barbarism’, and ‘man and\nwoman’ (Plumwood 2002). This is because these dualisms inherent to the\nAnthropocene help obscure the white, male and heterosexual subjectivity of\nWestern rationality.2\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 107\n\nOpposing the master narrative of the Anthropocene, Malm, Hornborg, Neckel and\nBarca rightly emphasize the importance of examining the historical specificity\nof capitalist production and its appropriation of economic, political, gender,\nracial and geographical inequalities. In this vein, they propose alternative\ngeological epochs such as the ‘Capitalocene’ (Moore 2016; Malm 2016),\n‘Technocene’ (Hornborg 2015) and ‘Plantationocene’\n\n(Haraway 2015). With the term ‘Capitalocene’, Malm, for example, aims to\nhighlight the ‘geology not of mankind, but of capital accumulation....\n\n[C]apitalist time, biochemical time, meteorological times, geological times\nare being articulated in a novel whole, determined in the last instance by the\nage of capital’ (Malm 2016: 391). The surface of the entire planet is covered\nby capital’s footprints, so the logic of capital needs to be analysed as the\norganizing principle of the planetary metabolism.3\n\n\n## **ii**\n\n**MoNisM aNd the ProductioN of Nature**\n\nSince capitalism essentially relies on a series of dualistic hierarchies, a\ncritique of the Anthropocene demands that we reflect upon the prejudices\narising from modern binarism. Considering the fact that even those who are\ncritical of capitalism have often been trapped into the productivist myth of\ndomination over nature as well as the marginalization of reproductive work, it\nis no coincidence that monist views have become dominant in recent critical\nenvironmental thought and even in Marxian ecology. However, even if the old\ndualist schemes surely need revision, it does not immediately follow that\nmonism is always superior to dualism. In fact, as mentioned in the last\nchapter, Malm and Hornborg distance themselves from Latourian monism and\ndefend a non-Cartesian kind of dualism despite their critique of the\nAnthropocene concept.\n\nOne of the main monist approaches in the Marxist tradition is the social\n\n‘production of nature’ as a kind of social constructivism. According to its\nproponents, although eco-centric approaches lament the destruction of ‘first\nnature’, that is, pristine nature external to society and untouched by humans,\nsuch a naïve society–nature separation fails to grasp the actual dynamics of\nthe social formation of nature in capitalism. Nature as such does not exist\nanymore as Neil Smith declares that ‘nature is nothing if it is not social’\n\n(N. Smith [1984] 2008: 47). The Anthropocene seems favourable to such a bold\nclaim, giving credibility to the account that ‘the social and the natural are\nseen to intertwine in ways that make their separation – in either thought or\npractice – impossible’ (Castree 2001: 3). Noel Castree (2013: 6) even suggests\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n108 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ treating ‘nature’ as ‘a particularly powerful\nfiction: it’s something made, and no less influential for being an artefact’.\n\nHowever, there are various problems with this kind of social constructivist\napproach to nature. First, it is necessary to distinguish between its\nepistemological and ontological dimensions, as discussed in the previous\nchapter. Our ‘knowledge of nature’ is discursively mediated by scientific\npraxes, and ‘making sense of nature’ is inevitably constrained by social power\nrelations. As long as human access to nature is conditioned by language, there\nis no full transparent and direct access to external nature as such. This does\nnot mean, however, that external nature independent of humans does not exist\nas if nature itself were ontologically constructed. In this warming world,\ntemperatures will continue to increase, ice will melt and sea levels will\nrise, even if there is no language and no human beings. These phenomena are\nobjective and count as obvious facts that exist independently of human\nconsciousness. Nature is socially _affected_ and _modified_ by humans, so\nnatural events like droughts and wildfires are affected by climate change due\nto CO 2\n\nemission from human economic activities fuelled by the burning of coal and\noil. In this sense, societies are physically reconstituting nature in such a\nway that they suffer from unintentional manufacturing ‘risks’ as a by-product\nof capitalist development (Beck 1992). Nevertheless, we cannot conclude from\nthis social influence and reconstitution that nature is ‘built’ as a social\nconstruct.\n\nIn short, the social production of nature confuses ‘modification’ and\n\n‘construction’ (Malm 2018: 37). For its advocates, touching is building.\n\nHowever, even if we touch a tree, it does not mean that we have ‘built’ the\ntree.\n\nThe tree retains its independent existence. While we can build a house, it is\nnot possible to build nature by sowing, cutting trees or mining coal. Rather,\nall economic activities are dependent on trees and coal, whose processes of\nformation are _independent_ of humans. Nature is an objective presupposition\nof production. Vogel’s constructivist critique of nature welcomes Bill\nMcKibben’s\n\n‘end of nature’ in a literal sense, but the end of nature is simply not the\ncase.\n\nEven today human labour is extremely dependent upon what is produced by nature\nwithout any human intervention, namely fossil fuel.4 If there were really no\nlonger any nature left, there would no longer be anything for capital to\nextract. Capitalism and our economic activities require nature at least as a\nform of natural resource that exists prior to its extraction and exploitation.\n\nMarx clearly recognized the objective and independent existence of nature,\nhighlighting this point with the expression ‘substratum’ in _Capital_ :\n\n‘This substratum is furnished by nature without human intervention. When man\nengages in production, he can only proceed as nature does herself: i.e.\n\nhe can only change the form of the materials’ ( _Capital_ I: 133). Marx’s\ntheory of metabolism negates the idea that nature is built by labour. Labour\n‘only https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 109\n\nchanges’ its forms. In arguing that touching immediately turns nature into\nbuilt nature, Vogel and Smith presume the absolute separation of Society and\nNature that exists prior to global capitalism. Only then is it possible for\nthem to argue that when society touches nature, the latter immediately\ndisappears.\n\nSince such a presupposition of Cartesian dualism is obviously problematic,\nVogel’s conclusion that we should treat nature as something akin to a\n‘shopping mall’ (Vogel 2015) is dubious as well.\n\nIn order to avoid falling into Cartesian dualism, whose negation only leads to\nan extreme form of social constructivism of nature, the concept of ‘societal\nrelationship with nature’ ( _gesellschaftliche Naturverhältnisse_) put forward\nby Christoph Görg is a useful point of reference as it allows a more nuanced\ntreatment of the society–nature relationship. Görg (2011: 49) acknowledges\nthat nature is _materially_ modified by economic and technical practices and\n_symbolically_ constructed through cultural and scientific discourses, but\nunlike Smith, Castree and Vogel, he does not argue that nature is socially\nproduced. Following the tradition of Adorno’s negative dialectic, Görg instead\nrefers to the ‘non-identity of nature’ and the ‘preponderance of the object’\n\n( _Vorrang des Objekts_), which is reminiscent of Lukács’s discussion of the\n\n‘identity of identity and non-identity’.\n\nAccording to Adorno, the preponderance of the object is what characterizes\nmaterialism: ‘It is by passing to the object’s preponderance that dialectics\nis rendered materialistic’ (Adorno [1966] 1990: 192).5 There is always an\naspect of objects that cannot be reduced to thought. Matter signifies non-\nidentity with concepts, and this non-identity signifies that nature is more\nthan human. In this sense, Adorno’s critical theory maintains a realist view\nthat ‘something’ outside exists (Görg 2011: 51). There exist apparent\naffinities between nature and society because society is also a part of\nnature, so society cannot fully dissociate itself from nature because of its\nconstitutive preponderance.6 Society remains founded upon nature: ‘society\nitself is determined by the things of which it is composed and … therefore\nnecessarily contains a non-social dimension’ (Adorno 2006: 122). Nature is a\nprecondition through which mediating social activities become possible, and\nnature and society are not separate and independent entities, but they are the\ntwo interrelated poles that encompass an array of impact potentials and\ncontexts that are socially malleable, but which always escape comprehensive\norganization and control. It is not coincidental that nature is experienced as\nan independent and autonomous entity despite our daily conviction that humans\nbelong to it. Contact between nature and society does not represent the ‘end’\n\nof nature but an essential character in the eternal process of social\norganization of human metabolic interaction with the environment.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n110 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ In this context, Thomas Jahn and Peter\nWehling, who likewise adopt the standpoint of a ‘societal relationship with\nnature’, argue that nature and society are interdependent and mediated in a\nprocessual interaction on both symbolic and material levels, but it is these\ntwo dimensions that must be separated\n\n‘analytically’ (Jahn and Wehling 1998: 84). Analytical separation is essential\nnot only because nature ontologically retains its independence separate from\nsociety but also because by erasing the essential difference between the two\nrealms, it becomes impossible to comprehend _how_ each historical stage of\nsociety organizes its unique metabolic interchange with nature. This\nhistorical and social investigation is, as Jahn and Wehling observe, possible\nonly based on the analytical distinction between society and nature.\n\nIn addition, the ‘societal relationship with nature’ approach reveals another\nimportant problem of the ‘production of nature’ – that is, its\n‘anthropocentric’\n\ncharacter (Castree 2001: 204). Constructivism of nature is characterized by\nits one-sided focus on how society _works upon_ nature. This risks falling\ninto a Promethean approach to nature, especially due to its insufficient\nattention to the non-identity and the preponderance of nature. From Adorno’s\nstandpoint, the social constructivist approach is problematic because the\nmeaning of nature is reduced to only that which exists to humans. This\napproach thus tends to reinforce an instrumentalist attitude towards nature.\nIn fact, nature can easily appear as a passive medium of human agency, as if\nit could be modified and manipulated at will. The social constructivist\napproach does not challenge the dominant narrative of the further\ntechnological intervention and modification of the natural environment for the\nsake of stewardship of the earth. It is rather compatible with a productivist\nversion of the Anthropocene narrative, but this is exactly why\nenvironmentalist criticisms of productivism directly apply to the scheme of\nproduction of nature.\n\nEven if such a productivist vision is not so explicit and the production of\nnature claims to be concerned with ecological issues (Castree 2002), the risk\nis always there. Marxism is traditionally sympathetic to technological\nprogress.\n\nEven today’s most prominent Marxist geographer, David Harvey, shows a\nsurprisingly negative reaction to the ecological turn in Marxism. Harvey wrote\nagainst John Bellamy Foster, claiming that his view of the ecological crisis\nis too ‘apocalyptic’:\n\nAgainst this [postulation of a planetary ecological crisis] it is crucial to\nunderstand that it is materially impossible for us to destroy the planet\nearth, that the worst we can do is to engage in material transformations of\nour environment so as to make life less rather than more comfortable for our\nown species being, while recognizing that what we do also does have\nramifications (both positive and negative) for other living species….\n\nPolitically, the millenarian and apocalyptic proclamation that ecocide is\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 111\n\nimminent has had a dubious history. It is not a good basis for left politics\nand it is very vulnerable to the arguments … that conditions of life (as\nmeasured, for example, by life expectancy) are better now than they have ever\nbeen and that the doomsday scenario of the environmentalists is far-fetched\nand improbable. (Harvey 1996: 194) Harvey is hesitant to incorporate\n‘pessimistic’ ecological ideas into Marxism, claiming that ‘a socialist\npolitics that rests on the view that environmental catastrophe is imminent is\na sign of weakness’ (Harvey 1998: 19). Furthermore, Harvey (1998: 19–20)\nstated that ‘the invocation of “limits” and “ecoscarcity”\n\nas a means to focus our attention upon environmental issues makes me as\npolitically nervous as it makes me theoretically suspicious’. Here Harvey\nagrees with Neil Smith ([1984] 2008: 247), who had criticized ‘left\napocalypticism’\n\nfor its recognition of natural limits because environmentalism falls into\nMalthusianism: ‘But the Malthusian scenario has never as yet really grabbed\nhold’ (Harvey 2011: 94).7 He rather stresses capital’s ability to convert any\n\n‘limits’ to mere ‘barriers’ (Harvey 2011: 90). Here a ‘socialist hesitation\nbefore environmentalism’ (Foster 1998: 56) is undeniable. Harvey’s scepticism\ntowards environmentalism ends up drawing upon journalists like Greg\nEasterbrook and Julian Simon. Famously enough, Easterbrook, in _A Moment on\nthe Earth_ ,\n\nargues that humans can ‘terraform’ Mars in order to have two biospheres as a\nsolution to overpopulation.\n\nNeil Smith shows the same hesitation before environmentalism. In the afterword\nto the third edition of his _Uneven Development_ , he expresses a\n\n‘skeptic’s’ attitude to the ways that global climate change is discussed in\nthe public sphere. This scepticism arises from his fear of what he calls\n‘nature-washing’: ‘… nature-washing reconstructs the apparently unassailable\npower of natural agency over and above the social’ (N. Smith [1984] 2008:\n246). Such a view of natural agency, says Smith, only leads to\n‘apocalypticism’ because it acknowledges the existence of forces of nature\nthat humans cannot change.\n\nHe cannot accept it because it contradicts Smith’s basic standpoint on the\nproduction of nature that is characterized by his ungrounded optimism that\nsocial power is always able to overcome the power of natural agency.\nSimilarly, Noel Castree is concerned about the ‘over-confidence’ of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its denunciation of\nclimate ‘denialists’\n\nand recommends that discussions in the mass media should be more ‘balanced’\n\n(Castree 2013: 242, 258). According to Castree, the exclusion of denialist\nvoices from public discourse is undemocratic, and the IPCC represents a new\nform of neo-Malthusianism, even if many environmentalists often problematize\nthe conservative estimation of the IPCC reports. Castree’s remark sounds anti-\nscientific, considering the fact that the most recent IPCC report (AR6) now\nconsiders human impact as the cause of climate change to be ‘unequivocal’.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n112 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ In any case, these three prominent\ngeographers are surprisingly reluctant to recognize natural limits even in the\nface of the ecological crisis. The reason is their ‘fear of Malthusianism’,\nwhich has to do with Harvey’s early intellectual career. His contribution to\nthe problem of nature originates from his prominent article ‘Population,\nResources, and the Ideology of Science’, published in the 1970s, which deals\nwith the population explosion and the scarcity of natural resources and\ndenounces neo-Malthusianism as an _ideology_ (Harvey 1974). At that time, the\nClub of Rome’s report _Limits to Growth_ and Paul R. Ehrich and Anne H.\nEhrich’s _Population Explosion_ were causing great anxiety about\noverpopulation and resource scarcity shortage. There were various criticisms\nof their pessimistic tone, but in Harvey’s view even the critics of _Limits to\nGrowth_ shared the neo-Malthusian paradigm that he thinks overemphasized the\nexistence of objective natural limits.\n\nAgainst the grain, Harvey points out that natural limits are not absolute.\n\nResource scarcity does not exist a priori without any reference to society but\ncan be determined only under a certain set of social relations. In other\nwords, overpopulation and resource scarcity do not exist independently of\ncapitalistically constituted relations of production but are relational\nconcepts whose meaning requires the specification of what and how society\nproduces.\n\nBy presupposing these historical relations as given and by fixing the purpose\nof social production and the manner of technical appraisals of nature as\nunchangeable, the size of populations becomes the only variable that can be\nmodified in the face of resource scarcity, inevitably falling into\nMalthusianism (Harvey 1974: 270). Harvey warns that environmentalism often\nmakes this kind of error despite its appeal to scientific facts. Here science\nplays an ideological function that masks or even justifies the existing social\nconstellation of power and domination in Western capitalism.\n\nHarvey’s critique of the ideology of science is founded upon Marx’s concept of\n‘relative surplus population’ as a critique of Malthus’s theory of absolute\nsurplus population. In the face of neo-Malthusianism, Harvey revives this\nMarxian approach to the issue of overpopulation and resource scarcity.\nAlthough Harvey as a ‘materialist’ nowhere negates the existence of physical\nnature, this critique of neo-Malthusianism has made him reluctant to recognize\n_any_ natural limits because he too hastily identifies their recognition as\nguilty of ‘Malthusianism’.8 When Malthusianism becomes such a broad framework,\nthere is no room for environmentalism. As quoted earlier, he even maintains\nthat ‘it is materially impossible for us to destroy the planet earth’, but the\nAnthropocene demonstrates that it is utterly possible for humans to destroy\nthe planet Earth to the extent that it will become unhabitable for humans (and\nmany other living beings).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 113\n\nHarvey’s hesitation explains why these Marxian geographers who advocate the\nproduction of nature thesis turn out to be quite reactionary in the sphere of\necology despite their self-claimed radical reconceptualization of the\nsociety–nature relationship. Again, it is helpful to refer to Adorno and\nHorkheimer’s _Dialectic of Enlightenment_. The modern project of instrumental\nreason is characterized by a ‘lack of reflection’\n\n(Horkheimer and Adorno [1944] 2002: 158) that ignores the non-identity of\nnature and reduces it to a mere tool to be controlled and exploited for the\nsake of exchange value in capitalism (Cook 2011). ‘Reification’ is the\n‘forgetfulness’\n\nof society’s embeddedness in nature as well as nature’s otherness. This\nneglect results in ‘imperialism’ against nature (Horkheimer [1947] 2016: 76).\nThe danger of monism in the ‘production of nature’ derives from its obscuring\nof the difference between the social and the natural that undermines the\nreflexibility over the non-identity of nature. According to Adorno, nature can\nbe useful for humans in various ways, but non-human nature has its own\npurposiveness that is indifferent and irrelevant to humans. Under the identity\nthinking of capital, nature is damaged even more.9\n\nIt is important to highlight that the recognition of objective natural limits\nis _not_ equal to Malthusianism. As Harvey rightly points out, Malthus’s\ntheory of overpopulation is founded on an ‘ideology of nature’ in that it\nobscures the historical and social character of subsistence (what people\nneed), natural resources (what they can use) and scarcity (how much they can\nuse) under capitalist relations. The problem of overpopulation arises not\nbecause the world is not rich enough to feed everyone but because its wealth\nis quite unevenly distributed in favour of the rich in the Global North –\nhence, Harvey’s call to radically transform the capitalist relation of\nproduction for a fairer and more just share for everyone. Harvey is certainly\ncorrect, but this kind of critique in no way needs to eliminate the objective\nbiophysical limits of the Earth.\n\nNo matter how hard capital attempts to discover new frontiers of nature and\nnew markets, there is no infinite space on the earth after all. Technological\nprogress can push limits back _to some extent_ , but entropy increases,\navailable energy decreases and natural resources get exhausted. These are\nobjective facts that are independent of social relations and human will. It is\ninadequate to call the recognition of these objective limits ‘weakness’ and\ndecry their\n\n‘apocalyptic vision of a planetary ecological crisis’. If this recognition\ncounts as Malthusianism, then the only way to avoid the Malthusian trap would\nbe the dogmatic denial of natural limits as such. Combined with Marxian\nPrometheanism, this easily turns into the problematic endorsement of further\ntechnological intervention in the form of genetic engineering, geo-engineering\nand nuclear fusion.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n114 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ **iii**\n\n**froM the aNthroPoceNe to the caPitaloceNe**\n\nDespite his problematic conclusion, Castree (2001: 204) at least recognized\nthe problem of anthropocentrism inherent to the ‘production of nature’ and\nargued for investigating ‘how produced nature affects capitalism’. In this\ncontext, Jason W. Moore’s discussion on the ‘Capitalocene’ marks a theoretical\nadvance compared with the ‘production of nature’, as he clearly integrates the\nrecent fruits of various critical discussions that pivot around the\nAnthropocene and overcomes the shortcomings of Smith and Castree.\n\nWhat is noteworthy here is Moore’s criticism of Engels’s ‘revenge of nature’.\nAccording to Moore, Engels’s theoretical limitation is apparent in his\n‘static’ and ‘ahistorical’ treatment of nature. Agreeing with Smith and\nHarvey, Moore claims that Engels’s conceptualization suffers from the\n\n‘fetishization of natural limits’ (Moore 2015: 80). This inevitably leads to\nthe\n\n‘consequentialist bias of Green Thought’ (Moore 2015: 171) because Engels’s\necological critique is trapped in a ‘Cartesian dualism’ of ‘Society’ and\n‘Nature’, two fully independent entities. His analysis can only confirm the\npredictable\n\n‘consequence’ that capitalism destroys nature. Engels’s conclusions may be\ncorrect – his claim that nature stops being a passive medium but attains\nagency rather matches Moore’s own view – but at the same time everyone already\nknows that capitalism is bad for the environment. Thus, Moore puts forward\nanother grandiose project of ‘world-ecology’. It aims to analyse the world-\nhistorical _process_ of how humans and nature incessantly ‘co-produce’\n\neach other through the web of life, culminating in the ecological crisis.\n\nMoore claims that his view is founded on Marx’s own, even though he criticizes\nEngels. As discussed in Chapter 2, it is not unreasonable to distinguish Marx\nand Engels, but Moore’s critique does not end with simply rejecting Engels’s\ntreatment of the human–nature relationship. Moore’s main opponent is John\nBellamy Foster and his colleagues, who employ the concept of ‘metabolic rift’.\nThis rejection is surprising, considering the concept’s growing popularity\namong Marxists as well as the fact that Moore himself used to employ it in\norder to grasp the tense relationship between humans and nature under the\ncapitalist world-system (Moore 2000, 2002).\n\nAll the same, in _Capitalism in the Web of Life_ , Moore significantly altered\nhis attitude towards the concept of metabolic rift, now denouncing it as\n\n‘Cartesian dualism’. Cartesian dualism assumes that Society works _upon_\nNature, but Moore argues that such a static division of Society and Nature\ncannot adequately analyse the dynamic historical process of capitalist\ndevelopment\n\n‘through’ nature – that is, the dialectical ‘co-production’ of society and\nnature https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 115\n\nin the singular web of life. ‘Nature is co-produced. Capitalism is co-\nproduced.\n\nLimits are co-produced’ (Moore 2015: 232). Without being able to adequately\ndeal with natural limits, the ‘metabolic fetish, and its manifold resource-\nand energy-determinisms’ represent the highest stage of this ‘Green\nArithmetic’\n\n(Moore 2015: 180): Society plus Nature equals Crisis. This is apparently too\nstatic like Engels’s ‘revenge of nature’. Today’s ecological crisis is,\naccording to Moore, a crisis of ‘modern-in-nature’ – that is, not the result\nof an ‘irreparable rift’ between Society and Nature but of the constant\n(re)configuration of flux and flow in the entire web of life under capitalism.\n\nMoore criticizes Engels and Foster, but _not_ Marx himself. On the contrary,\nhe defends his own interpretation as the true and more productive successor of\nMarx’s ‘theory of value’ and ‘philosophy of internal relations’\n\n(Moore 2015: 22). He claims that only by combining his critique of political\neconomy with his ecological analysis can the potential of Marx’s value theory\nbe fully realized. Foster’s interpretation, on the contrary, falls into an\n\n‘epistemic rift’ between ‘political economy’ based on the ‘theory of monopoly\ncapital’ (Paul Sweezy and Paul A. Baran) and ‘ecology’ based on the ‘theory of\nmetabolism’ (Lukács and Mészáros). The debate over whether ‘Marx’s ecology’\nexists has been affirmatively decided. The current controversy in Marxian\npolitical ecology centres on the search for an adequate method to\nconceptualize the relationship between humans and nature under capitalism and\nits contradictions in the Anthropocene.\n\nMoore’s method of world-ecology softens the binary of society and nature. In\norder to avoid falling into the static and apocalyptic conception of the\nmetabolic rift, as Moore believes Foster does, he argues that it is necessary\nfirst to abandon the epistemological framework that Society works _upon_\nNature and destroys it. This is why Moore highlights that nature and human\n\n‘co-produce’ together. Nature is in no sense a passive medium. In fact, the\ndevelopment of capitalism is always conditioned by nature. In this sense,\nnature possesses a certain form of agency as an ‘actant’ (Moore 2015: 196).10\nFor example, Moore describes that coal formation in England was a key actant\nfor British capitalism to take off. Compared to Smith’s and Castree’s\nproduction of nature approach, Moore focuses not simply on how capitalism\nproduces nature but also how capitalism is produced through nature. He thus\nreplaces the dualist conception of ‘Nature _plus_ Society’ with ‘society- _in_\n-nature or nature- _in_ -society’, and the idea that ‘capitalism acts _upon_\nnature’ is substituted by the monist scheme that capitalism ‘develops\n_through_ ’ the web of life because what is constructed is an intricate\nnetworked assemblage consisting of social and natural arrangements of actants.\nIn this way, his monist ontology attempts to avoid anthropocentrism, which\nallows him to elaborate on a more suitable framework of the Capitalocene – at\nleast at first glance.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n116 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Moore’s monist terminology is influenced by a\npopular discourse within political ecology that is characterized by a ‘hybrid’\nunderstanding of the human–nature relationship. This kind of monism challenges\nthe modern view of the subject–object relationship that attributes agency\nexclusively to humans. As Bruno Latour (1993) argues, agency must be\nredistributed to ‘things’. Such a new theoretical framework is quite critical\nof Marxism (Latour and Lépinay 2009), demanding a rethinking of its labour\ntheory of value, especially because of its ‘anthropocentric’ character. It is\nthus understandable that Moore also proposes its revision when he claims that\ncapitalism puts nature to ‘work’ in order to produce value: How is nature’s\nwork/energy transformed into value? … The question shifts our thinking away\nfrom too much of one thing (humans, or capitalism) and too little of another\nthing (Nature), and towards the _longue durée_ relations and strategies that\nhave allowed capitalism-in-nature to survive. And capitalism has survived not\nby destroying nature (whatever this might mean), but through projects that\ncompel nature-as- _oikeios_ to work harder and harder – for free, or at a very\nlow cost. (Moore 2015: 13)\n\nAccording to Moore, nature’s ‘work’ does not directly produce value – that\nwould be a negation of Marx’s labour theory of value – but the expropriation\nof the unpaid work of nature essentially contributes to capital’s\nvalorization.11\n\nIn this sense, nature is exploited, and Moore (2019: 53) even calls it\n‘biotariat’.\n\nThis extended conception of ‘work’ to include non-human work is common among\nthose who criticize the anthropocentrism of the Anthropocene discourse.\nStefania Barca (2020: 19) argues that ‘capitalism adopted this\n\n[anthropocentric] model of rationality in reshaping the notion of modernity as\nthe capacity to extract value from both human and non-human work’. The\ncritique of the master narrative of the Anthropocene ‘allows to see that the\nkey commonality between all non-master Others is a broadly defined but still\ncogent notion of _labour_ : from different positions, and in different forms,\nwomen, slaves, proletarians and animals and non-human nature are all made to\nwork for the master’ (Barca 2020: 6; emphasis in original).\n\nThis treatment of ‘work’, which redistributes agency to nature and blurs the\ndistinct roles of humans and nature in the production process, shows how Bruno\nLatour’s actor–network theory (ANT) is intruding into political ecology.\nLatour argues for ‘blurring the distinction between nature and society\n_durably_ , so that we shall never have to go back to two distinct sets’\n\n(Latour 2004: 36). According to his hybridism, it is no longer possible to\ndistinguish between social and natural phenomena. Latour, referring to ozone\ndepletion and wildfires, argued already in the early 1990s that the issue of\nenvironmental destruction cannot be neatly categorized into the sphere of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 117\n\nhumans and the sphere of nature. Natural phenomena such as ozone holes and\nclimate change are deeply entangled with social phenomena (production of Freon\ngas and emission of carbon dioxide from car and airplanes): ‘All of culture\nand all of nature get churned up again every day’ (Latour 1993: 2).\n\nAs everything seems to have become hybrid of society and nature in the\nAnthropocene, Latour’s hybridism has become a popular way to describe the\nAnthropocene in which things possess the active agency in uncontrollable\nwildfires and gigantic typhoons.\n\nIn short, according to Latourian monists, the Anthropocene is the age of post-\nnatural post-humanism, in which the hierarchical divide between humans and\nnon-human is dissolved into the world of ‘actants’\n\n(Purdy 2015: 271–2). This kind of understanding can be found among those who\ntake a Marxist approach. For example, Christoph Bonneuil and Jean-Baptiste\nFressoz refer positively to Latour and ask about how to overcome the dualism\nof human and nature: ‘How then are we to overcome the dualism between nature\nand society’? Then, they answer this question by emphasizing the importance of\ncomprehending a ‘double relation of internality’\n\nconsisting of ‘natures pervaded by social’ and ‘societies pervaded by nature’\n\n(Bonneuil and Fressoz 2016: 41). It is in this context that Bonneuil and\nFressoz speak highly of the ‘ecologized Marxism of Jason Moore’ and argue that\nthe metabolisms have ‘political agency’ too (Bonneuil and Fressoz 2016: 35–7).\n\nEven Slavoj Žižek is influenced by Latour’s monist approach. Žižek, who had\nrejected ecology as ‘a new opium for the masses’, recently changed his opinion\nafter the global pandemic and now recognizes the seriousness of the ecological\ncrisis as a contradiction of capitalism. However, in advocating for ‘a radical\nphilosophical change’ adequate to the Anthropocene, he also points to the\ninsufficiency of the Marxian dualist concept of ‘metabolism’: To confront the\nforthcoming ecological crisis, a radical philosophical change is thus needed,\nmuch more radical than the usual platitude of emphasizing how we, humans, are\npart of nature, just one of the natural species on Earth, i.e., of how our\nproductive processes (our metabolism with nature, as Marx put it) is part of\nthe metabolism within nature itself.\n\n(Žižek 2020a: 115)\n\nHere Žižek supports Latour’s ‘assemblage’ by criticizing Foster’s concept of\nmetabolic rift, which he thinks is not radical enough for the sake of\nadequately handling the current entanglement of the social and the natural.12\nThis is how Moore’s self-proclaimed ‘loyalty’ to Marx’s philosophy is\neffectively gaining more influence. Nevertheless, if Moore is right, the\nconcept of ‘metabolic rift’\n\nis no longer tenable. Before abandoning the concept, it is necessary to look\nat his claims a little more carefully.13\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n118 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Moore’s project of ‘world-ecology’ is an\nexpansion of Immanuel Wallerstein’s world-system analysis.14 In order for the\ncapitalist centres to attain greater profits, they exploit cheap labour from\nthe peripheries by creating a ‘semi-proletariat’ whose costs of reproduction\nfor capital is artificially low because they have other means of subsistence.\nThis ‘unequal exchange’ based on the exploitation of cheap labour results\nsimultaneously in\n\n‘overdevelopment’ in the Global North and ‘underdevelopment’ in the Global\nSouth. In Wallerstein’s theoretical scheme, the object of exploitation was\nhuman labour power, but that only deals with one side of the actual process of\nunequal exchange because it misses nature, the other essential component of\nproduction. There also exists ‘ecologically unequal exchange’ (Hornborg and\nMartinez-Alier 2016). Thus, it is not only labour power in the periphery that\nis exposed to capitalist robbery but also the non-human environment such as\nresource, food and energy. In other words, capitalism, which treats human\nbeings as a mere tool for capital accumulation, inevitably regards nature\nsimply as an object to be squandered. Extending Wallerstein’s argument, it is\npossible to say that the capitalist centres expropriate nature and externalize\nthe costs and burdens that lie behind economic development to the peripheries.\n\nMoore argues that capitalism’s lifeline is an abundant and cheap supply of\nwhat he calls the ‘Four Cheaps’, consisting of labour-power, food, energy and\nraw materials: ‘The law of value in capitalism is a law of Cheap Nature’\n\n(Moore 2015: 53). It is noteworthy that Moore includes ‘labour-power’ within\n\n‘Cheap Nature’. ‘Cheap Nature’ consists of a large number of humans such as\nthe poor, women, people of colour and slaves. Capital not only expropriates\nnatural resources but also constitutes and thoroughly utilizes gender\nhierarchy, violent colonial rule and technological domination over humans and\nnature to secure profitability and to globally expand the capitalist mode of\nproduction.\n\nMoore argues that capitalism did not simply develop through the ‘exploitation’\n\nof (male and white) workers in industrialized capitalist centres. Rather, it\nis essentially dependent on the ‘expropriation’ of the ‘unpaid work’ of the\nFour Cheaps. Through such a constant ‘thingification’ (Césaire [1955] 2000:\n42) of the world, capitalism reassembles networks of humans and nature and\nmakes them ‘work’ harder for the sake of profit making.15\n\nUpon this background, Moore attacks Foster’s metabolic rift as\n\n‘Cartesian dualism’, arguing that his own post-Cartesian approach is a more\nproductive interpretation of Marx’s own ecological critique of capitalism: The\n\n‘dialectical thrust of Marx’s philosophy is to see humanity/nature as a flow\nof flows’ (Moore 2015: 22). Moore proposes to analyse constant metabolic\n‘shifts’\n\nin the ‘singular metabolism’ of co-produced society and nature.16\n\nMoore’s treatment of Marx’s text is dubious, however. When he criticizes the\nmetabolic rift between social and natural metabolism and replaces it with\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 119\n\n‘metabolic shift’ in the singular metabolism, it is strange that he does not\nmention Marx’s own usage of ‘rift’. He writes: ‘Rather than ford the Cartesian\ndivide,\n\n[Foster’s] metabolism approaches have reinforced it. Marx’s “interdependent\nprocess of social metabolism” became the “metabolism of nature and society”.\n\nMetabolism as “rift” became a metaphor of separation, premised on material\nflows between Nature and Society’ (Moore 2015: 76). While ‘interdependent\nprocess of social metabolism’ is taken from _Capital_ , volume III,\n‘metabolism of nature and society’ is Foster’s formulation (Foster 2013), so\nthat it sounds as if he produced a dualist understanding of metabolism in\nfavour of the concept of metabolic ‘rift’, distorting Marx’s original and\npost-Cartesian insight.\n\nHowever, the passage to which Moore refers shows that Marx himself employed\nthe concept of ‘rift’, as he wrote that capitalist production ‘provoke[s]\n\nan irreparable rift in the interdependent process of social metabolism and\nnatural metabolism’. Moore arbitrarily cherry-picks from Marx’s original\npassage in favour of his own monist understanding of capitalism in the web of\nlife. It is ‘arbitrary’ because Marx clearly distinguished and contrasted two\nkinds of metabolism – one social and the other natural – warning against the\nformation of rupture in their perpetual interaction under capitalism. Did Marx\nalso fall into the ‘Cartesian divide’ by mistake? Or, is it an intentional\nexpression that is consistent with his method?\n\n\n## **iv**\n\n**NoN-cartesiaN dualisM of ‘forM’ aNd ‘Material’**\n\nFirst, Moore too hastily borrows an existing concept of Cartesian dualism\nwithout sufficiently considering its applicability to the Marxian concept of\n\n‘metabolic rift’. The accusation of falling into Cartesian dualism of Society\nand Nature makes sense only if Society remains fully outside Nature without\nany interaction like ‘mind’ and ‘body’ do in Descartes’s philosophy (Soper\n1995). Seen from this perspective, the Marxian concept of metabolism is anti-\nCartesian from the very beginning because neither Marx nor Foster assumes such\nan absolute separation of society and nature. The basic insight of Marx’s\ntheory of metabolism is, on the contrary, that humans always produce as a part\nof nature and that their activities are entangled with extra-human nature more\nand more in the course of capitalist development. Thus, the question needs to\nbe reformulated in the following way: why did Marx intentionally draw upon a\ndualist distinction of social and natural metabolism, _even though_ he held a\nmonist understanding of the universal metabolism of nature?17\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n120 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ As discussed in the last chapter, there is\nactually nothing wrong with separating the social from the natural _and_\ninsisting at the same time that humans are also a part of it. As Foster says:\n\nThere is no contradiction in seeing society as both separate from and\nirreducible to the Earth system as a whole, and simultaneously as a\nfundamental part of it. To call that approach ‘dualist’ is comparable to\ndenying that your heart is both an integral part of your body and a distinct\norgan with unique features and functions. (Foster and Angus 2016)\n\nIt is possible to add that the difference between society and nature is even\ngreater than that between heart and body. It is rather analogous to the\nrelationship between mind and body. Mind has a property that cannot be reduced\nto the materiality of the body, even though mind is connected to the\nmateriality of the brain. The reduction of mind to activities of the brain\nwould be crude materialism (Gabriel 2019), which is another extreme form of\nidentity thinking opposed to social constructivism. Similarly, society does\nnot exist without nature, but social relations produce their own unique\n_emergent properties_ that do not exist in nature without humans, even if the\nemergent properties of society cannot be fully separated from their material\nbasis and bearer. Capital is parasitic to its bearers and is thoroughly\ndependent on them, but capital remains blind to them until their degradation\nappears as an obstacle to valorization. This paradoxical character of capital\nis exactly why Marx’s critique of political economy puts emphasis on the\ndistinction _and_ interconnectedness of the ‘purely social’ forms and their\nmaterial ‘bearers’ and analyses their tension due to their non-identity.18\n\nThus, the rejection of Cartesian dualism does not automatically lead Marx to a\nflat ontology without any distinction between the social and the natural,\nsomething for which Hegel (1977: 9) once ridiculed Schelling as equivalent to\n‘the night in which … all cows are black’. Instead, Marx emphasized the\nuniqueness of human metabolism with nature compared with that of other\nanimals. This is not necessarily outdated anthropocentrism. Since Marx insists\nthat only human labour under certain social relations produces _value_ , the\ncategory of value in Marxian economics is inevitably anthropocentric.\n\nDue to this anthropocentric labour theory of value, critics often emphasize\nthe essential contribution of nature to production by recognizing its power to\nproduce value. However, here again, the question needs to be formulated the\nother way around. Marx’s theory of metabolism clearly recognized the essential\ncontribution of nature to production. If so, it is necessary to ask why Marx\nnevertheless formulated his labour theory of value without redistributing\nagency to nature and refused to attribute nature’s ‘work’ to an agency that\nproduces value.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 121\n\nHere the purely social dimension of ‘value’ is of importance because it is\nwhat gives human labour – more precisely abstract labour – a privileged role\n_in capitalism_ compared to non-human nature. Marx’s labour theory of value is\nanthropocentric, but he also added that not all human labour produces value,\ndistinguishing productive from unproductive labour. Depending on social\nrelations and material conditions, the same concrete labour can be productive\nor unproductive of value. Where does this difference come from?\n\nThe production of value is tied to commodity production, and Marx argued that\n‘private labour’ as a unique form of social division of labour necessitates\nthe category of value: ‘As a general rule, articles of utility become\ncommodities, only because they are products of the labour of private\nindividuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of\neach other’\n\n( _MECW_ 35: 83). Private labour designate a situation where labour is carried\nout without any previous social coordination among the members of a society.\n\nWhen private producers without any shared interest and personal ties meet in\nthe market in order to obtain products that others have, commodity exchange\ntakes place. In this sense, the social relation between private producers is\nbased on a relation between their products. In seeking to exchange their own\nproducts at an appropriate rate, private producers compare the ‘worth’ of\ntheir products. In doing so, use-value cannot be the standard for exchange as\nuse-values of products are all different and incomparable. Private producers\ninstead recognize a common social power of products, which Marx calls _value_\nas the objectification of the abstract labour that is common to all products\nof human labour _._ As Sasaki (2021: 67) argues, ‘... the only way for their\nlabour products to come into that relation [of exchange] is for the products\nto be treated as things of value’. _Only private labour produces value_ and\nprovides the products of labour with an economic form determined as the\ncommodity.\n\nHere private producers are compelled to unconsciously treat their products as\nthings of value. They create this purely social category of value.\n\nNevertheless, it is not an imaginary fiction but has an enormous objective\npower. Thus, Marx investigated how the purely social form of value that\ncontains ‘not an atom of matter’ dominates the metabolic processes of nature.\n\nThe capitalist mode of production subsumes the entire society under the formal\nlogic of value mediated by human agency as the personification of commodities,\nmoney and capital. Compared to non-capitalist societies, value brings about an\nhistorically specific dynamic of social and natural metabolism.\n\nThe purely social power of value contains no atoms of matter, but it is deeply\nentangled with the material conditions of the universal metabolism of nature\nbecause humans are part of nature. Precisely because nature exists\nindependently of and prior to those social categories and continues to retain\nnon-identity with the logic of value, the primacy of profit maximalization\nresults https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n122 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ in a series of disharmonies within natural\nmetabolism. ‘Rift’ is not a ‘metaphor’\n\nas Moore argues. Rift exists between the social metabolism of commodities and\nmoney and the universal metabolism of nature. Moore believes the concept of\nrift automatically implies a dualism, so he intentionally ignores Marx’s own\nusage of it. In contrast, Marx’s metabolic rift is consistently deduced from\nhis labour theory of value. In Marx’s view, it is essential to separate the\nunique form of value-producing labour as the organizing principle of the\nmodern bourgeois society. Otherwise, it is not possible to comprehend how the\nactual process of capitalist accumulation develops ‘through nature’. The logic\nof value determines what counts as Cheap Nature and how certain humans and\nnon-humans are used as free gifts of nature. Value must be comprehended based\non private labour as a unique way of organizing social division of labour.\n\nThis is why labour power cannot be reduced to a form of Cheap Nature because\nsuch a conception only obscures the logic of how and why the particular and\ncentral form of labour under commodity production necessitates the category of\nvalue.19\n\nMoore undermines the central role of labour in Marx’s political economy in\nfavour of monism. Therefore, he dismisses ‘metabolic rift’ as a mere metaphor\nthat does not exist in the actual web of life. The cost of reducing the rift\nto a metaphor is high, however. Andreas Malm points out that the allegedly\nradical view of Moore’s world-ecology is not radical enough because it occurs\nonly on the level of ‘language’ (Malm 2018: 181). Indeed, Moore’s phraseology,\nwhich is filled with newly invented vocabularies and hyphenations such as\n‘capitalism- _in_ -nature’ and ‘develop _through_ the oikeios’, reminds us of\nMarx’s famous eleventh thesis: ‘The philosophers have only interpreted the\nworld, in various ways; the point is to change it’ ( _MECW_ 5: 5).\n\nThereby Marx rejected Feuerbach’s ‘philosophy of essence’ (\n_Wesensphilosophie_) that aimed at enlightening the masses by pointing out the\n‘truth’ that God, an alienated omnipotent being, is in reality nothing but a\nprojection of humans’ own infinite and universal essence as ‘species-being’.\nMarx criticized Feuerbach that it is not sufficient to reveal the essence of\nChristianity and posed the question in a ‘materialist manner’ ( _Capital_ I:\n494), namely, ‘why’ and\n\n‘how’ people accept such an illusion and it actually dominates people’s life\n(Sasaki 2021: 36). Even if Feuerbach is right in pointing out that God is a\nproduct of the human imagination, it is necessary to ask how a certain set of\nsocial behaviour constantly produces and reproduces the alien power of God\nover human beings. Unless these social praxes are radically modified in\nreality, calls for the correct recognition of the true essence are unable to\novercome alienation.\n\nSimilarly, it is not enough to replace the dualism of Society and Nature with\nmonist expressions in language of hyphenation because a certain form\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 123\n\nof dualism _does_ possess an objective force to shape reality, even if Moore\nwith his ‘philosophical lens’ wishes to ‘interpret’ the world in a monist way.\n\nIn other words, when Marx described the problem of ‘rift’ between social and\nnatural metabolism in a dualist manner – as well as other issues such as\n\n‘productive’ and ‘unproductive’ labour – it is not because he mistakenly fell\ninto the Cartesian dualism. He did so consciously because the uniquely social\nrelations of capitalism do exert an alien power in reality. A critical\nanalysis of this social power inevitably requires separating the social and\nthe natural respectively as independent realms of investigation and analysing\ntheir entanglement thereafter. This is also what Lukács advocated. If the\nreality is dualist, re-describing it in a monist manner may end up mystifying\nthe particular arrangements and functioning of existing social forces\ncharacteristic of capitalism. In short, despite Moore’s critical intention,\nhis theory can fall into the ‘ideology of science’.\n\nTake an example of the ‘planetary boundaries’. The increasing emission of CO\nin the great acceleration is a social phenomenon tied to a certain 2\n\nway of organizing social production based on fossil fuels. Beyond a certain\ntipping point, it is probable that irreversible, rapid and unexpected changes\nwill be triggered through positive feedback effects. Due to the melting of the\nAntarctic ice sheet because of climate change, methane gas contained in the\nice will be released, accelerating climate change. Ocean acidification and\ndeforestation causes the decrease or extinction of certain species, which\ndisturbs the food chain, leading to the decrease of other species too. These\nchain reactions are not directly caused by human activities, and nor can\nhumans change them. This is why they are considered ‘irreversible’. The fact\nthat ice melts beyond 0 degrees or that shells need calcium carbonate (CaCO )\nbut that the absorption of CO decreases carbonate ion (CO 2−) and 3\n\n2\n\n3\n\nincreases bicarbonate ion (HCO3−) in the ocean is not something humans can\ndetermine nor modify according to will, no matter how hard they try. These\nphenomena are determined by natural processes that exist independently of and\nprior to human intervention. Although capitalist development affects nature\nthrough the commodification of fossil fuels, this fact does not make the\nnatural process social either. The environmental problem emerges precisely\nbecause natural laws exist objectively and independently of social ones, and\nbecause a particular way of organizing social metabolism based on the massive\nconsumption of fossil fuels greatly diverges – that is, creates a ‘rift’ –\nfrom the conditions of sustainable production prescribed by nature’s\nbiophysical processes.\n\nThis is why Andreas Malm (2018: 85) demands to focus on social causes of\necological crises based on _human_ ‘agency’, which must be strictly\ndistinguished from causal chains in nature. The increasing emission of\ngreenhouse gas as https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online\nby Cambridge University Press\n\n124 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ the direct cause of climate change and ocean\nacidification has an intimate relation with the social choice to use fossil\nfuels in capitalism. It is possible to make a different choice by using\nrenewable energy, for example. In short, there are certain things that humans\ncan consciously modify and others that they cannot. The natural planetary\nboundaries must be first recognized, and a sustainable society needs to\naccommodate itself to these limits.20 Thus, Malm maintains that the\n‘analytical distinction’ between the social and the natural is ‘ _the\nindispensable premise for any solution to such a combined problem_ ’ (Malm\n2018: 61; emphasis in original). Even though the critique of the Anthropocene\nnarrative based on its Eurocentrism and productivism is totally valid, the\nresponse should not be monism. Methodological or analytical dualism is\nindispensable in order to critically investigate the capitalist way of\norganizing production and constituting various unjust hierarchies.\n\nA just transition to a more sustainable production is also inevitably an\nanthropocentric project because it involves human beings aiming to overcome\nwhat they have created by themselves: ‘Ecological concerns are not problems\nderived internally, originating from ecosystems themselves, but are produced\nexternally, by social drivers. For example, the oceans are not polluting\nthemselves; _humans are doing it_ ’ (Longo, Clausen and Clark 2015: x;\nemphasis in original). Thus, only humans can consciously act to repair the\nrift. Marx demanded this in arguing for another way of conducting human\nmetabolism with nature by freely associated producers in order to abolish\nprivate labour and wage labour.\n\nThroughout this process, non-anthropocentric concerns are essential to\nproblematize the current ecological crisis and abandon the instrumental\nattitude towards non-human nature, but they are also only accessible to us\nbased on _our_ current understanding of the world and of non-human beings and\nare inevitably conditioned by human interests and perspectives. In this sense,\nthey inescapably remain ‘anthropocentric’ (Hailwood 2015: 20), but it is not\nnecessary to fall into human exceptionalism.21 Kate Soper criticizes the\nhypocrisy of post-humanist monism because post-humanism is actually\nanthropocentric and thus self-subverting:\n\nPosthumanist theory, however, is produced exclusively by and for human beings\nand it seeks a response through their particular capacities for adjusting\nthought and behaviour in the light of argument. It thus relies for its\ntheoretical coherence and ethical appeal on an implicit commitment to\ndistinctively human qualities, and by extension to intentionality and\nconscious agency. (Soper 2020: 22–3)\n\nTherefore, one should not be satisfied with pointing to the hybrid situation\nand end the analysis with a flat ontology. Rather, accepting the state of\nhybridity https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 125\n\nand a flat ontology is equivalent to falling for a fetishized understanding\nthat simply accepts what is given without revealing its social factors. In\nfact, the idea of ‘actant’ that distribute agency to things is incompatible\nwith Marx’s critique of ‘fetishism’ (Hornborg 2016: 11). Marx actually talked\nabout the\n\n‘agency’ of the thing in his analysis of commodity in _Capital_. He argued\nthat in capitalism the relations of things replace the relations of humans,\nand human agency is rather subjected to and constituted through the movement\nof things: social relations ‘do not appear as direct social relations between\npersons in their work, but rather as material [ _dinglich_] relations between\npersons and social relations between things’ ( _Capital_ I: 166). However, the\nwhole point of his critique of fetishism is to reveal the uniquely human\nagency that produces this pathological inversion of the subject and the object\nin the commodity-producing society. Stopping at the level of actant mystifies\nthe specific difference of the capitalist relations and the agency of reified\nthings by treating all the appearances of actants in the same way. By evenly\nredistributing agency, a flat ontology obscures the social impact of capital\nupon the environment as if nature’s impact were as significant as the social\none in the process of capital accumulation.22 It is after all _Anthropos_ that\ncreates oppression and hierarchy and destroys the environment. What is more,\nthis anthropocentrism also affects the vision of a post-capitalist society.\n\n\n## **v**\n\n**elasticity of caPital aNd ecological crisis** Despite his provocative\nlanguage, Moore’s theoretical framework of capitalist development and crisis\nis largely a repetition of the ‘second contradiction of capitalism’ originally\nsuggested by James O’Connor. According to O’Connor (1998), the first\ncontradiction of capitalism is characterized by the increasing productivity\nand increasing poverty of the proletariat, which ultimately leads to the\neconomic crisis of overproduction and the destabilization of the capitalist\nsystem. The second contradiction of capitalism arises due to an\n‘underproduction’\n\nof nature. In contrast to earlier crisis theories of ‘underconsumption’ that\napproach the problematic from the demand side (Luxemburg [1913] 2016),\n\n‘underproduction’ of nature results in a crisis on the supply side, which\naffects production costs. As the productive forces continue to increase under\nmarket competition, nature gets exhausted, so that the price of raw materials,\nenergy, food and labour power increases. This underproduction of nature\ndecreases the rate of profit, bringing about the stagnation of capital\naccumulation. A sudden interruption of supply and a dramatic increase in\nproduction costs can seriously harm the economy. Workers are fired and the\nwages stagnate. The https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online\nby Cambridge University Press\n\n126 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ social system is destabilized in the moment\nof crisis. Moore’s arguments about the end of Cheap Nature and the decline in\nthe ‘ecological surplus’ appears quite similar to O’Connor’s views.23\n\nThus, it is helpful to go back to earlier critiques of O’Connor’s theory with\nits theoretical limitations as a framework for grasping the ecological crisis\nunder capitalism. As Burkett (1999: 195) argues, O’Connor’s theory pivots\naround a _crisis of capital_ in that it is a crisis of capital accumulation\ndue to rising production costs and a corresponding decline in profitability.\n\nO’Connor underestimated Marx’s concept of the ‘elasticity of capital’, which\noffers a more dynamic account of the relationship between capital and nature.\n\nOnly if we neglect the astonishing elasticity of capital, does it sound\nplausible that the rising price of natural resources would threaten capitalism\nas the law of the rate of profit to fall penetrates itself. Yet Marx did not\nargue for an\n\n‘iron law’ of capitalism’s breakdown due to the falling rate of profit, but he\nrepeatedly emphasized that two aspects of the law of the rate of profit to\nfall\n\n‘contain a contradiction, and this finds expression in contradictory\ntendencies and phenomena. The contending agencies function simultaneously in\nopposition to one another’ ( _Capital_ III: 357). He was convinced that\ncapitalism develops through this ‘living contradiction’ ( _Grundrisse_ : 421).\nIn other words, the existence of contradiction drives further technological\nprogress and modifications in the production and circulation processes.\n\nWhile O’Connor tends to underestimate the elasticity of capital, Moore’s\n\n‘co-production’ of society and nature can be regarded as an attempt to go\nfurther than O’Connor by rejecting the existence of static natural limits and\nby more clearly emphasizing the elasticity of nature as the source of the\nastonishing vitality of capital. In fact, Moore repeatedly maintains that\nthere are no objective natural limits to capital, but that they are co-\nproduced in the web of life. His theory of underproduction of nature attempts\nto avoid both Malthusianism and the social constructivism of nature.\n\nMarx also argued that capital harnesses various elastic characteristics of the\nworld for the sake of producing greater flexibility: The natural materials\nwhich are exploited productively (and which do not form an element of the\ncapital’s value), i.e. soil, sea, mineral ores, forests, etc. may be more or\nless severely exploited, in extent and intensity, by greater exertion of the\nsame amount of labour-power, without an increase in the money capital\nadvanced. ( _Capital_ II: 432)24\n\nWith the aid of both science and technology, capital constantly appropriates\nnew raw materials and energies to increase productivity without proportionally\nincreasing the costs of production. In addition, capital utilizes nature’s\nelasticity https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 127\n\nto generate externalities and temporally and spatially shift the negative\nconsequences of the social costs from the centres to the peripheries.\n\nNevertheless, the elasticity of capital inevitably has objective limits. Once\nthese natural limits are surpassed, elasticity is lost entirely all of a\nsudden, just like an overstretched spring, so it no longer delivers capital’s\ndesired results.\n\nThis dependence on natural elasticity then turns out to be problematic for the\naccumulation of capital. The quality of natural power degrades when its\nmaterial characteristics continue to be ignored, and this can be accompanied\neven by the decrease in the _quantity_ of products as well. The difficulty\nincreases in the course of capitalist development because the concentration of\ncapital – as a response to the falling rate of profit in order to increase the\nmass of profit – requires a larger volume of raw and auxiliary materials to\nkeep production running. Difficulties increase as natural productivity may\nfail to catch up with industry’s rising productivity. There is a contrary\nmovement in these different spheres so that the productivity of labour rises\nin one place while, it falls in another. We need only consider the influence\nof the seasons, for example, on which the greater part of the raw materials\ndepends, as well as the exhaustion of forests and coal and iron mines, etc. (\n_Capital_ III: 369)\n\nThe elasticity of natural power may be able to cover such an increase of\ndemand for a certain period, but it triggers serious degradation and\nexhaustion of the natural conditions of production over the long term. This\ninevitably constrains capital accumulation while it also accelerates capital’s\nfurther intervention into nature. This is how capital and nature are ‘co-\nproduced’ and Moore seems to more properly grasp this dynamic logic of\ncapitalist development than O’Connor.\n\nNonetheless, Moore’s prediction for the future is as apocalyptic as Engels’s\n\n‘revenge of nature’: the degradation of the natural environment generates a\ncrisis for capital _one day_ due to the end of Cheap Nature. However,\nconsidering the enormous elasticity of capital, it remains unclear whether\ncapitalism or the Earth will collapse first. There is no compelling reason to\nbelieve that capitalism will collapse under rising production costs and\ndegrading natural conditions of production. This is unlikely, as capital can\nprofit even from natural degradation by finding new opportunities for\ninvestment in such disasters too (Burkett 2006: 136). As Naomi Klein (2007)\nhas documented, this possibility is clearly visible in what neoliberal\n‘disaster capitalism’ has done in the last decades. Capital continues to\nprofit from current ecological crises by inventing new business opportunities\nsuch as fracking, geo-engineering, genetically modified organisms (GMOs),\ncarbon trading and natural disaster https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n128 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ insurance. Incessantly attempting to shift\nthe rift, capitalism can keep going beyond these natural limits and accumulate\nmore wealth. In contrast, the current level of civilization cannot sustain\nitself beyond a certain point _precisely_ _due to objective natural limits_.\nAs far as the logic of capital’s accumulation is being estranged from human\nlife and the sustainability of the ecosystem, the capitalist system might\ncontinue to exist, even if all the planetary boundaries are exceeded, but many\nparts of the earth will be unsuitable for civilization.\n\nIn short, there is simply no empirical evidence that the pressure on profit\nrates due to the increasing costs of circulating capital will bring about an\n‘epochal crisis’ any time soon. For example, it is necessary to realize net\nzero carbon emissions by 2050 to keep global warming within 1.5°C by 2100.\n\nWhen this line is crossed, various effects might combine, thereby reinforcing\ntheir destructive impact on a global scale, especially upon those who live in\nthe Global South. However, capitalist societies in the Global North will not\nnecessarily collapse. This brief example suffices to show an enormous\ndifference between the material conditions for capital accumulation and the\nmaintenance of the liveable ecospheres.25 Since Moore’s concept of ‘epochal\ncrisis’ mainly deals with the crisis of capital accumulation, it tends to\nmarginalize ecological crisis as such.\n\nMoore’s weakness arising from this marginalization of ecological crisis\nmanifests in his vision of a transition to the future society. Since he\nanalyses today’s general crisis mainly from the perspective of capital, his\nvision of emancipation contains some tension with Marx’s humanism. According\nto Marx’s theory of metabolic rift, the ecological crisis significantly\nundermines the possibility of free ‘sustainable human development’ (Burkett\n2005). He warned that capitalist production ‘destroys at the same time the\nphysical health of the urban worker, and the intellectual life of the rural\nworker’.\n\nHumanism calls for the practical necessity of establishing a more sustainable\nform of production beyond capitalism before the latter collapses due to\nunderproduction of nature. In this sense, Marx problematized the ecological\ncrisis not from the standpoint of capital, but rather from the perspective of\nfree and sustainable human development, which monism cannot do well as it\nundermines the position of humanity. In fact, Moore confronts the difficulty\nwith Marx’s vision of establishing a future society by consciously changing\nthe form of human labour, that is transcending private labour and wage labour.\nInstead, Moore aims to overcome capitalism with the aid of nature as\n\n‘actant’ – its exhaustion, turbulence and the rising price of natural\nresources and energy. This is a revolt of the ‘biotariat’.\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, Marx’s anthropocentrism does not\nautomatically erase the non-identity of nature. An adequate treatment of\necological crisis requires that we recognize the non-identity of nature. Its\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 129\n\nrecognition remains ‘anthropocentric’ in that its non-identity can only be\ndefined in relation to identity, that is, in relation _to us_. This is not\npernicious as the critics of the Anthropocene narrative fear, however. Rather,\nthis kind of anthropocentrism is necessary in order to talk about the\necological crisis at all in a meaningful manner. Bacteria and insects may\ncontinue to live even after climate breakdown leads to the extinction of human\nspecies. However, if their existence prohibits us from talking about the\necological crisis from a human perspective, that basically negates the\nexistence of the ecological crisis.\n\nWithout anthropocentrism, it would actually be almost impossible to speak of\nthe ecological crisis because it exists mainly _for humans_.\n\n\n## **vi**\n\n**good aNthroPoceNe?**\n\nThere is no compelling reason to assume that capital will stop its\nintervention into nature in the face of the crisis of capital accumulation.\nFor example, Bruno Latour argues in his article ‘Love Your Monsters’ that the\ncrime of Dr Frankenstein is not that he created a monster but that he\nabandoned it due to fear. Latour continues:\n\nIt is not the case that we have failed to care for Creation, but that we have\nfailed to care for our technological creations. We confuse the monster for its\ncreator and blame our sins against Nature upon our creations. But our sin is\nnot that we created technologies but that we failed to love and care for them.\n(Latour 2011: 22)\n\nLatour prohibits the rejection of modern technologies and productivity all of\na sudden due to fear in the context of the hybrid situation. Rather, the way\nto go is to push this hybridization even further and to create ‘intimacy with\nnew natures’ (Latour 2011: 22). Latour’s attitude is _hypermodern_. His monism\nis exemplary in its ignorance of the ‘primacy of the object’ and ‘the non-\nidentity of nature’, which reinforces the Promethean project of domination\nover nature with a strong instrumentalist attitude. This notorious example\nsuffices to show that monism does not automatically provide a superior view of\nthe world compared to dualism if it denies the non-identity between humans and\nnature as well as the latter’s preponderance.\n\nLatour’s article was published in a journal edited by the US-based think tank,\nBreakthrough Institute, where he was a senior fellow. Although Latour denies\nthat he fully agrees with the general agenda of the think tank (Latour 2014:\n240), their affinity is visible. According to their view, the world has always\nbeen turbulent and so environmentalists are too romantic and even\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n130 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ reactionary in attempting to protect pristine\nnature in a state of equilibrium that never existed and will never exist.\nThus, _The Ecomodernist Manifesto_ – to which Latour is a contributor – claims\nthat further intervention in nature through ‘increasing social, economic, and\ntechnological power’ is a condition for the democratic ‘good Anthropocene’\n(Breakthrough Institute 2015). It is not clear at all how the idea of\n‘democratic control’ could be compatible with capital-intensive gigantic\ntechnologies such as geo-engineering, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and\nnuclear fusion.26 In any case, if technological and economic development alone\nwere sufficient to overcome the ecological crisis by fully remaking the earth,\ncapitalism could be salvaged. Leigh Phillips (2015), an advocate of\necomodernism, boldly declares that ‘there is no metabolic rift’.\n\nWhat does ecomodernism have to do with Moore? Moore does not endorse such an\nidea, but he refers to Ted Nordhaus and Michael Schellenberger, the founders\nof the Breakthrough Institute, as powerful critics of the dualist conception\ndominant in Marxism:\n\nA radical and emancipatory alternative does not deny the degradation of\nnature. Far from it! But a politics of nature premised on degradation rather\nthan work renders the radical vision vulnerable to a powerful critique. This\nsays, in effect, that pristine nature has never really existed; that we are\nliving through another of many eras of environmental change that can be\nresolved through technological innovation (Lynas 2011; Shellenberger and\nNordhaus 2011). The counterargument for the Capitalocene – an ugly word for an\nugly system – understands the degradation of nature as a specific expression\nof capitalism’s organization of work. (Moore 2016: 111)\n\nLater, Moore tacitly modified a similar passage to add that these arguments\nare\n\n‘rubbish’ (Moore 2017a: 78),27 but he still believes that monist ecomodernists\nare better than those who endorse the dualist concept of metabolic rift.\n\nOne may object that a reference to the Breakthrough Institute does not\nimmediately mean support for its ecomodernist vision. That might be true, but\nthis situation is similar to Harvey’s reference to Greg Easterbrook. This is\nthe risk of monism. Foster correctly emphasizes the danger of hybridism in the\nface of the global ecological crisis:\n\nIn the face of the very real bifurcation of the world in the Anthropocene by\ncapitalism’s alienated social-metabolic reproduction, to focus on the truisms\nthat in the end the world is all one, and that human production inevitably\ncreates new hybrid forms of human-nature linkages (as if this in itself\ntranscends natural processes and laws), is to downplay the real depths of the\ncrisis in which the world is now placed. (Foster 2016: 407)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 131\n\nMoore criticized the ‘fetishization of natural limits’ in Engels’s idea of\nnature’s revenge, but this rejection prompts him to endorse the idea of making\nnatural limits more elastic, although it is not comprehensible how his\nprediction of the end of Cheap Nature and his technological optimism can\ncoexist consistently in Moore’s theory. As a result, Moore can only vaguely\nanticipate the collapse of capitalism due to the end of Cheap Nature _one day_\nwhen capital’s technologies cannot open up new frontiers and overcome the\ntendency of a falling ecological surplus.\n\nAfter all, it is certainly necessary to intervene and modify the natural world\nin order to tackle today’s climate change. Recognition of the non-identity of\nnature is key, lest one falls into the illusion of absolute control over the\nentire eco-system. It requires humans to live with the irreducible otherness\nof nature. Nature resists their instrumentalist purposes as long as it has its\nown purposiveness that eludes human’s full grasp.28 From the perspective of\nthe ‘identity of identity and non-identity’ in Lukács’s sense, methodological\ndualism turns out to be indispensable to any critical theory of nature in the\nAnthropocene.29 Unfortunately, the current revival of post-capitalist\ndiscourses is heading in the opposite direction and endorses technological\nprogress. This situation is ironic because the late Marx came to question the\nemancipatory character of the capitalist development of productive forces.\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nThe inability of such an approach to analyse the social system means that the\nsolution to ecological crisis becomes a primitivist one of going back to\nnature or even returning to the Pleistocene in order to regain closeness to\nit. Or worse, the extinction of humans becomes a topic of philosophical\ninvestigation in the Anthropocene.\n\n2\n\nIn fact, although most of the excessive burden upon the global environment is\ndue to the economic activities of people living in the Global North, its\neconomic development model is generally assumed to be self-evident. That is\nwhy economic growth and technological innovation continue to be regarded as\nthe only solution to the multi-stranded crises in the Anthropocene. This\nsolution would be, however, hypocritical because those who are responsible for\nthese crises now propose solutions to them and praise them in order to justify\ntheir conventional rule and way of life. They are part of the problem, not the\nsolution.\n\n3\n\nMore recently, however, Malm (2018) seems to distance himself from his earlier\nusage of the ‘Capitalocene’. This is presumably because Jason W. Moore (2015)\npropagates the same concept, but Malm is highly critical of Moore’s monist\nunderstanding of the current ecological crisis.\n\n4\n\nMcKibben’s argument was also problematic due to his conflation of touching\nnature with the end of nature. Here it is possible to discern his Cartesian\ndualism.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n132 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ 5\n\nAdorno, however, did not develop his theory of negative dialectic in terms of\necology. Görg’s project counts as a critical expansion of original attempts\nmade by the first generation of the Frankfurt School. One reason for this is\nthat Adorno did not pay attention to Marx’s concept of metabolism as a\nfoundation of the ecological critique of capitalism. Likewise, Alfred Schmidt\n([1971] 2014) did not elaborate on the ecological critique despite his lengthy\ntreatment of Marx’s concept of nature and rather characterizes Marx as a\ntechnological determinist. I do not necessarily agree with Cassegård’s defence\nof Adorno’s and Schmidt’s interest in nature in an ecological sense (Cassegård\n2017), but I am certainly sympathetic to Cassegård’s insistence on the non-\nidentity of nature as the foundation of a ‘critical theory of nature’.\nCassegård (2021) also supports my understanding of Marx’s dialectics of ‘form’\nand ‘matter’.\n\n6\n\nThis is true for Marx as it defined the role of labour as the ‘mediating’\nactivity of the metabolism between humans and nature. ‘Mediation’ implies that\nMarx was aware that nature cannot be erased and that it retains its\nindependence no matter how labour seems to be able to manipulate the external\nnature.\n\n7\n\nHarvey (2011: 94) adds: ‘Because capital has successfully done this in the\npast does not necessarily mean, of course, that it is destined to do so in\nperpetuity.’\n\nBut taken together with his previous remark about Foster, it is questionable\nhow much he really believes this. Only in 2019 did Harvey finally admit the\nseriousness of ecological crisis as an epochal crisis without attributing it\nto apocalypticism, but this is almost too late. Listen to his podcast ‘The\nPlastic Industry and CO Emission and Climate Change’.\n\n2\n\n8\n\nThis fear of Malthusianism is influential in the Marxian tradition. Even the\nyoung Marx fell into a productivist view that negates the existence of natural\nlimits (Saito 2017).\n\n9\n\nMarx also emphasized that the modification of nature cannot be arbitrary.\n\nLabour alone cannot produce natural substances, and its power is limited; it\ncan only modify their shapes according to various purposes. He wrote that\nlabour provides ‘natural substance’ with ‘ _external form’_ ( _Grundrisse_ :\n360; emphasis in original). For example, the form of a desk that labour\nprovides to the ‘natural substance’ of wood remains ‘external’ to the original\nsubstance because it does not follow the ‘immanent law of reproduction’.\nAlthough the immanent law maintains the wood in its specific form of a tree,\nthe new form of a desk cannot reproduce its substance in the same way, so that\nit now starts to get exposed to the natural force of decomposition. In order\nto protect the product of labour from the power of natural metabolism, a\npurposeful regulation of metabolism through productive consumption is\nrequired, which nonetheless cannot fully overcome the force of nature.\n\n10 Moore might respond that he only used the term ‘actant’ once, and his view\nis not identical with Latour’s ‘flat ontology’. He might add that his theory\nis _not_ monism because he also employed the term ‘monism’ only once and also\nuses\n\n‘soft dualism’ in _Capitalism in the Web of Life_ (Moore 2015: 13, 85). Yet it\ndoes not really matter how many times he used these terms. After all, he fails\nto explain https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 133\n\nhow his view differs from Latour’s flat ontology and other kinds of monism and\nwhat his ontology actually is after his determined rejection of Cartesian\ndualism.\n\nActually, if he really accepts ‘soft dualism’, there is no significant\ndifference between his world-ecology and the metabolic rift school.\n\n11 ‘All of these de- and un-valued forms of work are, however, outside the\nvalue form (the commodity). They do not directly produce value. And yet – it\nis a very big and yet – value as abstract labor cannot be produced except\nthrough unpaid work/energy’ (Moore 2015: 65). Others are much more explicit\nabout the value produced by extra-human agencies, suggesting ‘the value theory\nof nature’ (Yaşın 2017: 397), but this simply reverts to physiocracy.\n\n12 This move is not surprising in that it is more or less consistent with his\nearlier criticism of environmentalism that naively presupposes the harmonious\ntotality of nature (Žižek 2008: 444). Furthermore, this leads Žižek (2020b) to\ncriticize my understanding of nature as well as of abstract labour. Žižek – he\nis by no means alone – claims that abstract labour is historically specific to\ncapitalism.\n\nHowever, this argument conflates value and abstract labour. Value is purely\nsocial and specific to capitalism, but abstract labour is an abstraction of\none aspect of human labour, which exists as long as humans labour. According\nto Marx’s methodology, there is nothing wrong with separating the\ntranshistorical dimension of abstract labour from its socially specific\nfunction in valorization under capitalism.\n\n13 Certainly, the popularity of monism is understandable, considering their\ncommon interest in overcoming Cartesian dualism of Society and Nature.\nHowever, Bonneuil and Fressoz also recognize Marx’s contribution in his\nanalysis of ‘the metabolic rupture between Earth and society that capitalism\nhad produced’\n\n(Bonneuil and Fressoz 2016: 176) and often draw upon Foster’s analysis of the\nmetabolic rift. In other words, they think it is their contribution to Marxian\necology to expand the metabolic rift approach in the context of ‘world-\necologies’\n\nthat deal with the unequal exchange of value and ecological flows without\nreally questioning whether such a synthesis is really possible.\n\n14 In fact, the term ‘world-ecology’ stems also from Wallerstein (1974: 44).\n\n15 The ecofeminist tradition is also quite essential for understanding the\nlong history of marginalization of reproductive labour from Marxist discourse.\nHowever, it is noteworthy that Silvia Federici (2004), a leading Marxist\nfeminist, does not adopt the monist standpoint. Monism is not necessary even\nif we recognize the exclusion of various kinds of work from ‘productive’\nlabour.\n\n16 Žižek (2020b) also argues that my approach is anti-Hegelian. My critique of\nWestern Marxism strengthens this impression. However, the methodology of\n_Form_ and _Stoff_ is an inheritance from Hegel’s _Wesenslogik_.\n\n17 Marx claimed that labour cannot be realized without nature’s assistance (\n_Capital_ I: 134). In this sense, the entire world is certainly ‘co-produced’\nin the labour process. Purely seen in terms of the circulation of matter and\nenergy, there is no distinction among various kinds of metabolism conducted by\nhumans, https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n134 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ non-human animals and non-living beings. Even\nif labour is a uniquely human activity, metabolism with the surrounding\nenvironment is also conducted by bees and beavers, while non-living inorganic\nmatter is also exposed to natural processes of metabolism such as decay and\noxidization. Marx’s materialist view is a _monistic_ one which encompasses the\nuniversal metabolism of nature. This simple explication alone should suffice\nto negate the accusation of Cartesian dualism directed against Marx and\nFoster.\n\n18 Castree (2002: 138) recognizes this point when he criticizes ANT. It is a\npity that in attempting to defend Harvey and Smith he undermines his own view.\n\n19 The category of ‘labour’ does not play any noticeable part in Moore’s\nreconceptualization of ‘metabolic rift’ into ‘metabolic shift’ within a\n‘singular metabolism of human-in-nature’ (Moore 2015: 83). His monism\nundermines the importance of labour power as a specific category in value\nproduction. It is true that the contribution of natural forces gives the\nappearance that nature produces value too, because it cheapens the cost of\nproduction, but by attributing the role of ‘unpaid work’ for that reason,\nMoore obscures the concept of value and the historical specificity of value-\nproducing private labour. His expression that nature also ‘works’ is\nconsistent with his tendency to attribute agency to nature next to humans. Yet\nMarx never said that nature ‘works’ because such a standpoint would be a\nretreat to physiocracy. He criticized Adam Smith’s residual physiocracy in his\ntreatment of agriculture in _Capital_. Smith wrote in _Wealth of Nations_ :\n‘In agriculture, too, nature labours along with man; and though her labour\ncosts no expense, its produce has its value, as well as that of the most\nexpensive workmen’ (A. Smith 1937: 344). In Smith’s view, ‘labouring cattle’\nproduce value too. This is strikingly similar to Moore’s view of ‘nature’s\nwork’ and the ‘ecological surplus’ as value-producing elements. By accepting\nthe appearance of production, value becomes a transhistorical and non-\nanthropocentric category. Consequently, he cannot explain _why_ labour\nproduces value only in capitalism and why the category of value becomes a\nuniversal and objective one in capitalism.\n\n20 The same applies even for the advocators of further technocratic\nintervention in nature. It is first necessary to recognize the current Earth\nsystem to decide in how and at what scale geo-engineering should be\nintroduced. This also presupposes the unity-in-separation. It is up to humans\nto decide whether further intervention beyond natural limits should be carried\nout or should be refrained from for the sake of respecting certain boundaries.\n\n21 Moore argues that such a view ‘remain[s] captive to the logic of human\nexceptionalism’ (Moore 2015: 77), but this need not be the case. The point is\nsimply that it is not possible for humans to obtain a non-human perspective.\n\n22 Again, this does not deny that capital is dependent on and conditioned by\nmaterial conditions.\n\n23 Strangely enough, Moore refers to O’Connor only once in _Capitalism in the\nWeb_ _of Life_ in an irrelevant context.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Monism and the Non-identity of Nature_ | 135\n\n24 Changes occur in various ways, depending on how capital takes advantage of\nthe material characteristics of each component. For example, labour power is\nalso elastic in that it can be further exploited both intensively and\nextensively for the sake of increasing the rate of profit. Instead of hiring\nnew workers in the case of a sudden increase in demand, current workers are\nmade to work longer hours even without additional wages. Workers can be used\nwith greater intensity too.\n\nThe content of their activities is not fixed but elastic in that they can\nperform various tasks in accordance with constantly changing market demands.\n\n25 Another possibility that Moore does not discuss is accumulation of capital\nthrough green technologies. Solar power in particular is an ideal source of\nCheap Nature by reducing marginal costs to zero (Rifkin 2014). This issue will\nbe partly discussed in the next chapter.\n\n26 The problem of technology and post-capitalism will be discussed in the next\nchapter.\n\n27 Moore copies and pastes this passage in another article only to add the\nlast sentence: ‘A politics of nature premised on degradation rather than work\nrenders the radical vision vulnerable to a powerful critique. That critique\nsays, in effect, that pristine nature has never really existed; that we are\nliving through another of many eras of environmental change that can be\nresolved through technological innovation. Of course such arguments are\nrubbish’ (Moore 2017a: 78).\n\n28 The danger of monism is discernible even among environmentalists. While the\npractice of ‘caring’ based upon ‘interspecies communication’ for the sake of\n\n‘multispecies ecojustice’ would be worth attempting through a post-Cartesian\nrationality, monist concepts such as ‘forestzenship’ (Barca 2020: 58),\n‘biotariat’\n\n(Moore 2019) and ‘hybrid labour’ (Battistoni 2017: 5) also risk erasing the\nnon-identity of nature. They rather remind us of the danger of ‘either\nequating the _domestication_ of nonhuman nature with “caring” for it, or of\nreading human values into nonhuman nature’ (Hailwood 2015: 151).\n\n29 There is a need for pluralism (Malm 2018), but for the purpose of the\ncurrent investigation, responding to the criticism of dualism, it suffices to\nreject the monist standpoint.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.005 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n**5**\n\n**The Revival of Utopian Socialism and**\n\n\n## **the Productive Forces of Capital**\n\nTraditionally, Marxists are sympathetic to technological progress. They often\nproclaim that only the further development of productive forces prepares the\nmaterial conditions for the post-capitalist mode of production. While the late\nHerbert Marcuse (1992) came to explicitly emphasize the environmentally\ndestructive aspects of capitalist production, even he was optimistic about the\npossibility of technological advancement as the major force for human\nemancipation beyond scarcity and poverty through the famous dialectics of\nquantity and quality. He suggested that the biological foundation would have\nthe chance of turning quantitative _technical progress_ into qualitatively\ndifferent ways of life – precisely because it would be a revolution occurring\nat a high level of material and intellectual development, one which would\nenable man to conquer scarcity and poverty. If this idea of a radical\ntransformation is to be more than idle speculation, it must have an objective\nfoundation in the production process of advanced industrial society, in its\ntechnical capabilities and their use. For freedom indeed depends largely on\ntechnical progress, on the advancement of science. (Marcuse 1969: 19)\nUnfortunately, the Promethean dream of realizing freedom through technical\nprogress has not been realised. Or, to put it in terms of the dialectic, the\ndialectical transformation of quantity to quality happens only in such a way\nthat technical ‘progress’ comes to exert an uncontrollable destructive power\nover the planet.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 137\n\nDespite its history of failure, Promethean ideas are again coming back to have\na great influence within political ecology. In fact, ecomodernist ideas become\nhegemonic as the ecological crisis deepens. Now the development and\napplication of gigantic technologies and science seems to be the only solution\nthat is fast enough and on a sufficient scale to tackle the serious threat of\nclimate breakdown. The new advocates of Prometheanism argue that\nenvironmentalists, by contrast, are too naïve in calling for slowing down and\nscaling down to live in harmony with nature. Environmental Prometheanism is ‘a\nlesser evil’ (Symons 2019: 52).\n\nContemporary Marxism is also responding to this situation. For example,\nAlberto Toscano (2011) insists upon reviving the ‘Promethean’ ideals of the\nleft in order to envision a post-capitalist world. The Promethean spirit is\nalso reflected in Aaron Bastani’s vision of ‘luxury communism’: ‘Our ambitions\nmust be Promethean because our technology is already making us gods – so we\nmight as well get good at it’ (Bastani 2019: 189). Supporters of this ideal\nare often categorized as ‘left accelerationists’, and they are ‘late-\ncapitalist utopians’\n\n(Benanav 2020: 11).1 This optimistic turn within Marxism, after decades of\npessimism brought about by the collapse of actually existing socialism, is\ncharacterized by the open endorsement of the exponential growth of new\ntechnologies, such as full automation with the aid of artificial intelligence\n(AI) and robotics as well as the sharing economy through ICT and IoT. While\nthese new technologies cause social anxiety about mass unemployment caused by\ncompetition with machines, utopian socialists boldly maintain that they open\nup new possibilities to establish a ‘postcapitalist world without work’\n\n(Srnicek and Williams 2016).\n\nEnvironmentalists might immediately dismiss such technocratic arguments as\nirrational. They reinforce the impression that Marxism is incapable of\nlearning from its past mistakes. Nevertheless, I welcome new attempts to go\nbeyond the long-lasting ‘capitalist realism’. Marx valued\n\n‘utopian socialists’ such as Robert Owen and Henri de Saint-Simon more highly\nthan ‘bourgeois socialists’ like Pierre-Joseph Proudhon who accepted the\nmarket and wage-labour as the basis of socialism. That was because these\nutopians enriched the radical imaginary for an alternative post-capitalist\nsociety instead of idealizing and naturalizing particular elements of the\nexisting society. Similarly, late-capitalist utopians provide powerful\ninspiration for emancipatory post-capitalist potentials. These political\nimaginaries are in dire need in the moment, when the legitimacy of capitalist\nsystem is increasingly in question due to the long depression, severe\nausterity, growing economic inequality, as well as the catastrophic\ndegradation of natural environment.\n\nAdmitting the practical contributions of late capitalist utopians, this\nchapter critically examines their Promethean claims in close relation to\nMarx’s https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n138 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ own project, with a particular focus on his\necological critique of capitalism.\n\nThe key question is why, in _Capital_ , Marx abandoned some of the central\nideas he elaborated in the 1850s that are nonetheless passionately endorsed by\nthe left accelerationists. In other words, their theoretical framework is one-\nsidedly dependent on Marx’s concept of the ‘general intellect’ explained in\nthe section known as the ‘Fragment on Machines’ in the _Grundrisse_ written in\n1857/8. Marx no longer endorsed these views in _Capital_. Tracing what\nhappened to Marx during those ten years, this chapter demonstrates that Marx\nbecame much more critical with regard to the emancipatory potentialities of\nthe development of productive forces under capitalism. The key concept that\ncharacterizes this decisive shift in Marx’s conception of history is that of\n\n‘productive forces of capital’. Furthermore, this concept is closely tied to\ntwo other important concepts: ‘cooperation’ and ‘real subsumption of labour\nunder capital’. Only by correctly grasping these three concepts _together_ is\nit possible to set up criteria for adequately dealing with the dual – or\n‘dialectical’ –\n\naspects of incessant technological development under the capitalist mode of\nproduction. While Marx clearly continued to believe that technological\ndevelopment under capitalism provides the necessary material conditions for a\nleap to socialism, his dialectical method came to more emphatically emphasize\nthe negative and destructive side of new technologies. His critique of\ntechnology is more important than ever in the context of the Promethean\nrevival in the Anthropocene, but it also reveals to Marxism a wholly new\nhorizon for a post-capitalist society.\n\nIn order to clarify this point, this chapter starts with an overview of why\nrecent forms of Prometheanism treat new technologies as an opportunity to\ntranscend capitalism (I). As left accelerationists admit, their view is\ngrounded upon Marx’s _Grundrisse_ (II). While the _Grundrisse_ was written in\nthe late 1850s, the next section introduces Marx’s concepts of ‘productive\nforce of capital’ and ‘real subsumption’ elaborated in the 1860s in order to\nrelativize some of the key arguments made in the _Grundrisse_. These new\nconcepts indicate that Marx in the 1860s had consciously abandoned the\nproductivist idea of history that was remnant in the _Grundrisse_ (III). This\ntheoretical development is of great significance for reconstructing the non-\nPromethean Marx. This shift is reflected in Marx’s discussion on ‘cooperation’\nin _Capital_ , which is non-existent in the _Grundrisse_. Consequently, he was\ncompelled to cast doubt on the progressive character of the development of\nproductive forces. These three concepts, however, create some tension with his\nearlier view of historical materialism (IV). Since contemporary utopian\nsocialists miss Marx’s theoretical change in the 1860s, they inevitably\nretreat to his Prometheanism of the 1850s. One limitations of this is the one-\nsided focus on a _political_ struggle that pivots around electoral politics\nwithout challenging https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online\nby Cambridge University Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 139\n\nthe economic structure and consumerist ideas that continue to constrain our\npolitical imaginary (V).\n\n\n## **i**\n\n**full autoMatioN as aN oPPortuNity for**\n\n**Post-caPitalisM**\n\nIn the face of the recent development of AI, robotics, biogenetic and\nnanotechnology, there is growing anxiety about massive technological\nunemployment and growing economic inequality. Frey and Osborne (2017) predict\nthat most work can be replaced by machines in the next decades, and there is\nno guarantee that even high-level professional jobs such as bankers, tax\naccountants and journalists will be free from this danger.2 The underlying\nproblem today is that, in contrast to the industrial revolution, in which the\nsurplus population was absorbed from rural areas into a large number of\nfactories in the city, the new industries created in the third industrial\nrevolution do not create new jobs but rather accelerate deindustrialization in\nthe developed countries. Combined with the global outsourcing and off-shoring\nof factory production, digitalization intensifies the competition among\nworkers more than ever as it allows workers all over the world to participate\nin the same job market. The vast number of ‘relative surplus population’ is\ndiscernible in increasingly precarious jobs with casual working hours and\nstagnant wages.\n\nMartin Ford predicts that although the development of technology is generally\nregarded as the key factor for economic growth, the extreme concentration of\nwealth by a few privileged digital-haves will lead to ‘techno-feudalism’\n\n(Ford 2015: 210). From the standpoint of the ruling class, information\ntechnology also enables the monitoring of every single activity, and big data\ncollected through such monitoring can be used to intervene in social\nbehaviours and desires (Zuboff 2019). In contrast to the prognosis that the\ndevelopment of information technology would open up a more free and democratic\nspace, ‘big data-enabled, IT-backed authoritarianism’ seems to point to a\n‘path towards an entirely new, potentially totalitarian future’. This is a\n‘new digital Leninism’ (Heilmann 2016).3\n\nHowever, for some Marxists, the prognosis of digital feudalism is too\npessimistic. Instead of slowing technological and scientific progress out of\nfear of dystopia, they even argue for accelerating it further in the name of\nhuman emancipation. In a manner that reminds me of Latour’s call to ‘love your\nmonster’, they also attempt to envision a post-capitalist alternative by\n\n‘reintegrating human labour into the machine’ (Noys 2014: 12). They see\nroughly three emancipatory tendencies in contemporary capitalism.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n140 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ **1\\. Full Automation and a World without\nWork** Mass unemployment due to automation is certainly not desirable for\nworkers.\n\nEven if full automation could produce massive cheap goods and services, modern\nwage-labourers would not be able to attain the means of subsistence if they\ncould not sell their labour power due to harsh competition with machines and\nother precarious workers. Their existence is fundamentally dependent upon the\nwage, so workers are compelled to accept even low-paid jobs with long hours\nlest they starve to death.4 However, seen from a different perspective, the\nthreat of mass unemployment signifies the irrationality of the current\neconomic system. If the threat of mass unemployment is emerging and wages are\ncut, that is _precisely because_ the current level of productivity is already\nsufficiently high to satisfy human needs without making everyone work so long.\nNotwithstanding, productivity must become ever higher in capitalist production\nas capitalists under market competition are forced to constantly introduce new\ntechnologies, further deepening the contradiction. Capitalism cannot shorten\nwork hours – labour is the only source of value and the rate of profit falls\nfurther due to the mechanization of capital’s dependence on the production of\nabsolute surplus-value – while the high rate of unemployment cannot be\ntolerated either. This dilemma shows that capitalism cannot use its high\nsocial productivity for the sake of human well-being.\n\nOnce the obsolete work ethic of capitalism is overcome, however, higher\nproductivity can be utilized to minimize or even eliminate drudgery and to\nsimultaneously increase the amount of wealth and free time for everyone.\n\nAccelerationists thus insist that workers should not be afraid of the threat\nof robots but endorse full automation: ‘Full automation is a utopian demand\nthat aims to reduce necessary labour as much as possible’ (Srnicek and\nWilliams 2016: 114). Full automation prepares the conditions whereby a great\nnumber of social needs can be satisfied with a small amount of labour and\nnatural resources. John M. Keynes ([1930] 1971) once predicted that by 2030,\nwork time will be reduced to 15 hours a week, so the real economic problem for\nthe human society would be how to spend the leisure time. His prediction has\ncertainly not come true but this is not because he was totally wrong but\nbecause capitalism persists. A post-work society could be realized immediately\nwith a leap to a post-capitalist society.\n\n**2\\. Zero Marginal Cost and the Society of Abundance** Today’s challenge to\ncapitalism does not come from full automation alone.\n\nJeremy Rifkin in his _Zero Marginal Cost Society_ (2014) explicates the\ndestructive impacts of the ‘third industrial revolution’ upon the current\nmarket system. According to him, information technology brings about\nrevolutionary https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 141\n\ntransformations in the entire production process because it can produce goods\nand service as ‘free, instant and perfect’ copies. Music and newspaper are\nRifkin’s primary examples. When they are digitalized, the production costs for\nan extra unit will be reduced almost to zero once the music is recorded or the\ntexts written. This is in clear contrast to the previous method of production,\nwhich incurred an additional cost for producing every unit of CD and\nnewspaper. Rifkin bluntly predicts that the marginal cost will be tendentially\nreduced to zero in various branches of production thanks to new information\ntechnologies supported by 3D printers and renewable energies.\n\nThe zero marginal cost society is characterized by an ever-greater abundance\nof free wealth. Expressed in Marxian terms, information technology destroys\nthe market system by decoupling use-value from value. Perfect digital copies\nare free _precisely because_ they are instantly produced and thus require no\nexpenditure of human labour. Information technology exponentially increases\nthe amount of use-value – ‘Moore’s law’ – so that the output of labour no\nlonger corresponds to the labour inputs. If goods and services are produced\nand distributed at zero marginal cost, the price mechanism breaks down\naccording to the labour theory of value. Material and immaterial wealth is\nrapidly expanding, while its value is constantly decreasing. This is a great\nthreat to capitalism. As Paul Mason (2015: 142) argues, ‘a world of free stuff\ncannot be capitalist’.\n\nSimilarly, Rifkin highlights the incompatibility of capitalism and the newly\nemerging collaborative economy, which will bring about the ‘demise’\n\nof capitalism:\n\nThe slow demise of the capitalist system and the rise of a Collaborative\nCommons in which economic welfare is measured less by the accumulation of\nmarket capital and more by the aggregation of social capital. The steady\ndecline of GDP in the coming years and decades is going to be increasingly\nattributable to the changeover to a vibrant new economic paradigm that\nmeasures economic value in totally new ways.\n\n(Rifkin 2014: 20)\n\nCombined with full automation, renewable energy, cellular agriculture and\nasteroid mining, the third industrial revolution will overcome scarcity of\nlabour, energy, food and resource, and their abundance will make the system of\nvalue obsolete. Aaron Bastani boldly declares this post-scarcity society as\n\n‘fully automated luxury communism’:\n\nSo as information, labour, energy and resources become permanently cheaper –\nand work and the limits of the old world are left behind – it turns out we\ndon’t just satisfy all of our needs, but dissolve any boundary between the\nuseful and the beautiful. Communism is luxurious – or it isn’t communism.\n(Bastani 2019: 56)\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n142 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ **3\\. Network Effects and the Crisis of\nPrivate Property** As Rifkin’s discussion of a zero marginal cost society\nindicates, immaterial production based on knowledge plays a central role in\nthe age of information technology. Already in the early 1990s Peter Drucker\npointed out that\n\n‘knowledge is now fast becoming the most important factor of production’\n\n(Drucker 1993: 8). He believed that free and autonomous collaboration assisted\nby information technology would destroy the managerial hierarchy in the labour\nprocess and replace it with a more horizontal and democratic form of\nproduction. This democratic production is threatening to capital because the\nknowledge economy is ‘potentially free’ (Gorz 2010: 53). Knowledge and\ninformation are common goods to be shared widely, so they are by nature\nincompatible with exclusive and monopolized possession. In fact, they create\n\n‘positive externalities’ that emerge out of a network effect of connected\nindividuals. The more interaction and communication develop through the\nnetwork, the greater the positive externalities that can increase the\nproductive forces. In this sense, the knowledge economy as the main driver of\nthe third industrial revolution is essentially democratic, horizontal and\ncommunal.\n\nYet it is precisely this communal character of knowledge that poses a problem\nfor capitalism. Private property is indispensable for capital accumulation.\nHowever, such a monopoly inevitably lessens the utility of immaterial goods\nbecause it weakens the positive network effect of collaborative commons\ncreated through social cooperation. There is also a problem of legitimacy too.\nWhen goods and services are essentially produced through social cooperation,\nit is not clear to whom they should belong, and it is questionable whether a\nproduct whose nature is inherently social should be patented and monopolized\nby a few. With the expansion of the social network, the system of private\nproperty is increasingly under challenge. Rifkin (2014) optimistically\nforesees the future of ‘collaborative economy’ through the exponential growth\nof positive network effects that would ultimately blow away the system of the\nprivate property. Of course, if the system of private property collapses, so\ndoes capitalism. Capital’s countertendency to the network effects lies in\nconstructing a monopolized digital platform and knowledge from which rent can\nbe extracted by artificially creating scarcity and exclusivity of information\n(Srnicek 2016). However, the dilemma for capital never disappears. Such rent-\nseeking by means of monopoly inevitably hinders further development of the\ncollaborative economy as a source of profits. Furthermore, the costs of\nprotecting the monopoly become very high because there is a constant risk that\na free network emerges, which makes the entire business no longer profitable\n(Hardt and Negri 2005).\n\nSumming up these three tendencies towards post-capitalism, Mason maintains\nthat a new form of post-capitalist society is emerging today:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 143\n\nThe main contradiction today is between the possibility of free abundant goods\nand information and a system of monopolies, banks, and governments trying to\nkeep things private, scarce and commercial.\n\nEverything comes down to the struggle between the network and the hierarchy,\nbetween old forms of society moulded around capitalism and new forms of\nsociety that prefigure what comes next. (Mason 2015: xix) The future, in this\naccount, looks ‘clear’ and ‘bright’ (Mason 2019), but is it true?5\n\n\n## **ii**\n\n**the _Grundrisse_****aNd the ‘geNeral iNtellect’**\n\nAlthough Keynes and Drucker provide important inspiration for today’s utopian\nvisions of post-capitalism, it is without doubt Marx who unified the three\naspects outlined in the last section for a project of post-capitalism. The\n_Grundrisse_ , or more precisely, the section known in English as the\n‘Fragment on Machines’, plays a central role here.6\n\nFirst, Marx in the ‘Fragment on Machines’ argued based upon his labour theory\nof value that there is a serious dilemma of capitalist production.\n\nCapitalists under market competition incessantly introduce new machines and\nincrease the productive forces in order to acquire extra surplus value.\nHowever, this process of mechanization inevitably expels workers from the\nlabour process unless the scale of production expands more rapidly than the\nrate of increase in productivity. This accelerated expansion of production\ncannot last forever anyway, because social needs are inevitably finite, so\ncapitalist development tendentially leads to the diminution of workers\nemployed in the labour process:\n\n‘Capital here – quite unintentionally – reduces human labour, expenditure of\nenergy, to a minimum’ ( _Grundrisse_ : 701). Thus, increasing investment in\nfixed capital is accompanied by the diminution of the value produced by\nworkers, while material wealth increases thanks to the increase of social\nproductive forces under large-scale industrial production. As production\nbecomes more and more independent from the actual expenditure of human labour\nand the meaning of labour for the production of social wealth declines, value\nceases to be a measure of material wealth: ‘But to the degree that large\nindustry develops, the creation of real wealth comes to depend less on labour\ntime and on the amount of labour employed than on the power of the agencies\nset in motion during labour time’ ( _Grundrisse_ : 701). In the end, the gap\nbetween value and real material wealth increases to the point where the\nmeasure of value becomes ‘anachronistic’ (Postone 1996: 197).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n144 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Seen from a different perspective, this rapid\ndevelopment of productive forces significantly reduces ‘necessary labour\ntime’. Marx predicted a future of increasing ‘free time’ that is available for\nnon-compulsory activities:7\n\nThe saving of labour time [is] equal to an increase of free time, i.e. time\nfor the full development of the individual, which in turn reacts back upon the\nproductive power of labour as itself the greatest productive power....\n\nFree time – which is both idle time and time for higher activity – has\nnaturally transformed its possessor into a different subject, and he then\nenters into the direct production process as this different subject. This\nprocess is then both discipline, as regards the human being in the process of\nbecoming; and, at the same time, practice, experimental science, materially\ncreative and objectifying science, as regards the human being who has become,\nin whose head exists the accumulated knowledge of society. ( _Grundrisse_ :\n711)\n\nOne can easily deduce from this argument the legitimation for Srnicek and\nWilliams’s claim that full automation realizes the emancipation from work as\nwell as the full development of the individual in a post-work society.\n\nFurthermore, in this quoted passage Marx emphasizes that the increase of free\ntime is closely related to the social character of ‘accumulated knowledge of\nsociety’ by arguing that social networks based on the combination and\ninterconnection of individuals becomes ‘giant social forces’ in the form of\nthe objectified human knowledge in fixed capital. Here Marx introduced the\nfamous concept of the ‘general intellect’ in order to highlight that the\ncondition of production is increasingly dependent upon the social force\nmediated by autonomous social collaboration and communication: ‘The\ndevelopment of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge\nhas become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the\nconditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of\nthe general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it’ (\n_Grundrisse_ : 706). The power of the general intellect comes from the\npositive network effect of free individuals. Capital cannot fully manipulate\nthe enormous social power of the collaborative economy because the imposition\nof strict control and regulation for the sake of valorization undermines this\nsocial power. At the same time, further development of social collaboration\nand free knowledge destabilizes the market mechanism and the system of private\nproperty.\n\nMarx even proclaimed that further increase of the new productive forces blows\naway the barriers set up by capital and establishes a post-capitalist society:\n\nOn the one side, then, it calls to life all the powers of science and of\nnature, as of social combination and of social intercourse, in order to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 145\n\nmake the creation of wealth independent (relatively) of the labour time\nemployed on it. On the other side, it wants to use labour time as the\nmeasuring rod for the giant social forces thereby created, and to confine them\nwithin the limits required to maintain the already created value as value.\nForces of production and social relations – two different sides of the\ndevelopment of the social individual – appear to capital as mere means, and\nare merely means for it to produce on its limited foundation.\n\nIn fact, however, they are the material conditions to blow this foundation\nsky-high. ( _Grundrisse_ : 706)\n\nOnce the collaborative economy fully liberates the general intellect beyond\ncapitalism, increasing free time and free goods will realize the all-round\ndevelopment of the individual. The utopian socialists thus seem to be\nconvincingly arguing that Marx was a ‘fully automated luxury communist’\n\n(Bastani 2019) – at least in the _Grundrisse_.\n\n\n## **iii**\n\n**subsuMPtioN of labour aNd the Productive**\n\n\n## **forces of caPital**\n\nAlthough today’s automation utopians appeal to the _Grundrisse_ , one needs to\nbe a little more cautious before generalizing their claims about the post-\nscarcity economy as embodying Marx’s definitive vision of a post-capitalist\nsociety. Marx never published the _Grundrisse_ during his lifetime. As the\nfirst systematic attempt of his political economy, it was theoretically\npremature in various ways. While it is certainly true that the _Grundrisse_\ncontains highly original ideas that cannot be found in Marx’s later economic\nworks (Negri 1992), one should not forget that Marx abandoned some of his\nearlier key ideas when writing _Capital_. For example, Marx never again used\nthe term\n\n‘general intellect’ in his later writings,8 which poses the question of\nwhether there was a shift in his conception of capitalist development in the\nbeginning of the 1860s. In fact, Marx introduced a series of new ideas in the\n1860s. One of them was the distinction between ‘formal’ and ‘real subsumption’\nin another unpublished manuscript, the _Economic Manuscripts of 1861–63_.\n\nThe distinction between ‘formal’ and ‘real’ is representative of Marx’s own\nmethodological dualism. As seen in his theory of metabolism, Marx’s discussion\nbegins with distinguishing the material side of labour process and its\n‘economic form determination’ ( _Formbestimmung_) as the valorization process\nin analysing their ‘unity-in-separation’ in actual capitalist production.\n\nIn other words, the transhistorical material process of the labour process\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n146 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ attains a uniquely capitalist function as the\n‘valorization process’ for capital.9\n\nAccording to Marx’s methodology, formal subsumption simply denotes the\neconomic form determination as the ‘valorization process’ to the ‘labour\nprocess’. That is, it introduces the capitalist relations of production\nbetween capital and wage-labour, while there are not yet substantial changes\nin the material aspects of the labour process. In this sense, the\nrelationships between\n\n‘form’ ( _Form_) and ‘matter’ ( _Stoff_) remain external to each other at this\nlevel, so the mode of production peculiar to capitalism is not yet established\nwith formal subsumption alone. However, capital does not stop there. Marx\nrather asked ‘to what extent the character of the labour process is itself\nchanged by its subsumption under capital’ ( _MECW_ 30: 64). In fact, _Form_\nand _Stoff_ become increasingly intertwined and entangled in the course of\ncapitalist development as capital thoroughly transforms and reorganizes the\nlabour process. This takes place through what Marx called ‘real subsumption’.\nIt is through this ‘real subsumption’ that the material aspect of the labour\nprocess becomes ‘adequate’\n\nto the capitalist mode of production.\n\nThe _Economic Manuscripts of 1861–63_ define ‘formal subsumption’ in the\nfollowing way:\n\nHistorically, in fact, at the start of its formation, we see capital take\nunder its control (subsume under itself) not only the labour process in\ngeneral but the specific actual labour processes as _it finds them available_\nin the existing technology, and in the form in which they have developed on\nthe basis of non-capitalist relations of production. It finds in existence the\nactual production process – the particular mode of production – and at the\nbeginning it only subsumes it _formally_ , without making any changes in its\nspecific technological character. ( _MECW_ 30: 92; emphasis added) The formal\nsubsumption of labour under capital does not affect the character of the\nactual labour process but simply takes what it ‘finds available’ as it is and\nintroduces new relations of production. In other words, the capitalist\nrelations of production dissolve the older ones based on craftsmanship and\nguilds, and replace them with the new social relations of capital and wage-\nlabour without changing the technological composition of production. Now\ncapital supervises the workers and imposes command over them. Marx wrote that\nformal subsumption ‘consists in the worker’s subjection as worker to the\nsupervision and therefore to the command of capital or the capitalist’ (\n_MECW_ 30: 93).\n\nThis command of capital aims at ‘the most effective, most exact organisation\nof the actual labour process, which depends on the will, the hard work etc.,\nof the worker’ for the sake of increase of the value of capital ( _MECW_ 30:\n94).\n\nCertainly, there already emerges a significant change in the labour process as\na result of the formal subsumption of labour under capital. The\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 147\n\nduration and continuity of labour increases because the primary aim of the\nproduction becomes the production of surplus value instead of concrete use-\nvalues for the sake of satisfying human needs.10 This change significantly\ndegrades the physical and mental conditions of workers. Nevertheless, since\nthe form determination of the production process as the capitalist relation of\nproduction between capital and wage-labour does not modify the organization of\nproductive forces, only the production of ‘absolute surplus value’ is possible\nthrough the extension of the working day. In this sense, formal subsumption\nalone cannot create a system of production adequate to the capitalist mode of\nproduction.\n\nIn contrast, Marx wrote about the ‘real subsumption of labour under capital’\nin _Results of the Immediate Process of Production_ in the following manner:\n\nWith the real subsumption of labour under capital a complete (and constantly\nrepeated) revolution takes place in the mode of production, in the\nproductivity of the workers and in the relations between workers and\ncapitalists.... On the one hand, _capitalist production_ now establishes\nitself as a mode of production _sui generis_ and brings into being a new mode\nof material production. On the other hand, the latter itself forms the basis\nfor the development of capitalist relations whose adequate form, therefore,\npresupposes a definite stage in the evolution of the productive forces of\nlabour. ( _Capital_ I: 1035)\n\nSimply gathering a number of workers in one factory is not enough for real\nsubsumption, even if there exist cooperation and division of labour. That\nremains the level of formal subsumption. Real subsumption needs to push\nforward _with capital’s own initiative_ an efficient way of production that\n‘give[s]\n\nthe very mode of production a new shape and thus first create[s] the mode of\nproduction peculiar to it’ ( _MECW_ 30: 92). Instead of accepting as they are\nthe conditions of labour that capital finds available, it actively creates\nqualitatively new productive forces and a _uniquely_ capitalist way of\nproduction _sui generis_.\n\nBy modifying the entire labour process not only through the application of\nscience and technology but also through the social organization of labour –\nthe way the workers work – capital overcomes the external relationship between\n_Form_ and _Stoff_ that can still be seen in formal subsumption.\n\nOne may immediately think about machinery and industrial production as the\ncapitalist relations that are unique to capitalist production, but such a view\nnarrows the whole discussion of the real subsumption to technological changes.\nAlthough large-scale industry surely realizes the specifically capitalist from\nof production and maximizes the productive forces of capital, Marx emphasized\nthat the analysis of ‘cooperation’ ‘both historically and _conceptually_ ’\n\nprovides the theoretical foundation for the real subsumption ( _Capital_ I:\n439; https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n148 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ emphasis added). He also added that\ncooperation is the ‘fundamental form of the capitalist mode of production’ (\n_Capital_ I: 454). Cooperation is the first step in organizing the entire\nlabour process from the standpoint of capital, which brings about ‘real\nalteration of the mode of production itself ’ ( _MECW_\n\n30: 263). As Marx wrote:\n\n[Cooperation] is the first stage at which the subsumption of labour under\ncapital no longer appears as a merely formal subsumption but changes the mode\nof production itself, so that the _capitalist_ mode of production is a\nspecific mode of production.… With cooperation a specific distinction already\nenters the picture. The work takes place under conditions in which the\nindependent labour of the individual cannot be carried on –\n\nand indeed these conditions appear as a relation dominating the individual, as\na band with which capital fetters the individual workers.\n\n( _MECW_ 30: 262)\n\nCooperation ‘changes the mode of production’ and begins to create the\n\n‘specific’ mode of production. By contrast to the formal subsumption, the real\nsubsumption changes both the technological composition _and_ the social\nrelations of production. In fact, capital organizes cooperation in the labour\nprocess in such a way that individual workers can no longer conduct their\ntasks alone and autonomously, but are subjugated to the command of capital.\n\nHarry Braverman describes this process as the ‘separation of conception from\nexecution’ (Braverman 1998: 79) and he analyses it as an effective way of\nsubjugating workers to the supervision and command of capital. Just as an\norchestra requires a conductor, cooperation always requires coordination and\nadjustment regardless of the relations of production. That is to say, it is a\ntranshistorical requirement. However, under capitalism this direction function\nis integrated as one of the ‘functions of capital’ and ‘acquires its own\nspecial characteristics’ ( _Capital_ I: 449). Consequently, capitalist command\ndevelops ‘into a requirement for carrying on the labour process itself, into a\nreal condition of production’ ( _Capital_ I: 448). This command becomes\nindispensable for workers to successfully carry out their labour, but now this\nfunction is fundamentally driven by the effective valorization of capital, so\nits alien and dominating character appears ‘purely despotic’ to the workers (\n_Capital_ I: 450).\n\nThe fact that workers can conduct labour only under the despotic rule of\ncapital means that they are not simply deprived of the objective means of\nproduction. Rather, workers also lose the _subjective_ conditions of\nperforming their labour, that is, the power of ‘conception’. It is this\ntendency inherent to cooperation that strengthens with the implementation of a\n‘division of labour’ and of ‘machinery’. Workers increasingly lose their\nknowledge, skills https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online\nby Cambridge University Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 149\n\nand insight into the entire labour process because it is organized by capital.\n\nSkilled workers are replaced by unskilled ones as capital analyses, divides\nand recombines the labour process that now consisting of simple, repetitive,\ncalculable and mechanic tasks. Since capital entirely reorganizes the labour\nprocess independently of workers’ experience and knowledge, workers have to\npassively follow commands from above. The results of this process are clearly\ndiscernible in that today’s workers could not assemble automobiles or\ncomputers even if they had access to the means of production because they lack\nthe knowledge of how each part functions in the final product.\n\nThat is how workers become ‘subjectlos’ and confront the objective means of\nproduction without the ability to realize their own labour. In this way, the\nreal subsumption greatly increases workers’ dependence upon capital, while the\nobjective conditions for realizing workers’ capacity increasingly appear as\n‘an _alien power_ , as an _independent power_ ’.\n\nInsofar as capital as objectified labour – means of production – employs\nliving labour, the ‘relation of subject and object is inverted’ in the labour\nprocess ( _MECW_ 30: 113). Marx also called this inversion of the subject and\nthe object\n\n‘a personification of the thing and a reification of the person’ ( _MECW_ 34:\n123). Since labour is ‘embodied’ in capital, the role of the worker is reduced\nto a mere bearer of the reified thing, that is, the means of preserving and\nvalorizing capital next to the machines ( _Versachlichung der Person_), and\nthe reified thing attains the appearance of the subjectivity that controls as\nan alien power the behaviour and the will of the person ( _Personification der\nSache_).\n\nAs the reified power of capital penetrates the labour process, the increase of\nsocial productive forces emerges only through capital’s initiative. Precisely\ndue to this process, workers’ autonomy and independence are fatally\nundermined, and they become much more easily tamed and disciplined under the\nregime of capital. Exposed to competition for jobs, workers passively follow\nthe strict orders and commands of capital.\n\nSince the conditions of carrying out labour are monopolized by capital, and\nsince the increase of productive forces is possible _only_ under capital’s\ninitiative and responsibility, the new productive forces of workers’ social\nlabour does not appear as their own productive forces but as the ‘productive\nforces of capital’: ‘To the extent that the worker creates wealth, living\nlabour becomes a power of capital; similarly, all development of the\nproductive forces of labour is development of the productive forces of\ncapital’ ( _MECW_ 30: 112). Summing up, Marx wrote that\n\nthe _social conditions_ of labour, which emerge from the _social productive_\n_power_ of labour and are posited by labour itself, appear most emphatically\nas forces not only alien to the worker, belonging to _capital,_ but also\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n150 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ directed in the interests of the capitalist\nin a hostile and overwhelming fashion against the individual worker. ( _MECW_\n34: 29–30) Cooperation under capital brings about new productive forces that\nindividual workers cannot exert, but it is capital that appropriates the\nfruits of cooperation as a free gift: ‘The socially productive power of labour\ndevelops as a free gift to capital…. [It] appears as a power which capital\npossesses by its nature – a productive power inherent in capital’ ( _Capital_\nI: 451).\n\nSince the development of productive forces under capitalism only increases the\nalien power of capital by depriving workers of their subjective skills,\nknowledge and insights, it does not automatically open up the possibility of a\nclear bright future. Notwithstanding, contemporary utopian socialists focus\nsolely on the _Grundrisse_ , so they tend to marginalize Marx’s critique of\nproductive forces. They too narrowly understand the concept of ‘productive\nforces’ as if they were equivalent to ‘productivity’ defined as the ratio of\ninput and output.11 The concept of ‘productive forces of capital’ indicates\nthat Marx’s concept of productive forces is actually broader. It also has to\ndo with what humans can produce and how they do so. In other words, it\nincludes human productive capacities such as skill, knowledge and strength as\nwell as natural conditions (Cohen [1978] 2000: 55). These capacities\nespecially have to do with workers’ autonomy, freedom and independence, which\nare essential for overcoming alienation of labour. In this sense, the concept\nof productive forces is both quantitative _and_ qualitative.12 The\nquantitative increase in productivity through full automation, for example,\ncan be accompanied by the qualitative degradation of working conditions as\nwell as of the natural environment, hindering the full development of the\nindividual. For Marx, that does not necessarily count as the real development\nof ‘productive forces’.\n\nTo sum up, Marx in the 1860s came to emphasize that the increase in the\nproductivity of capital is accompanied by a uniquely capitalist way of\norganizing the material aspect of the production process. According to this\nunderstanding, the establishment of the ‘capitalist mode of production’ is\nfounded upon transformations in both the ‘formal’ and ‘material’ aspects of\nproduction. That is, capitalist production is based upon the economic\n‘relations of production’ mediated by wage-labour relations as well as the\n‘productive forces’ that emerge from a specifically capitalist way of\norganizing the labour process. This dual aspect of the mode of production is\nconsistent with Marx’s method of separating and unifying the _purely social_\nand the _material_ in order to analyse how metabolism between humans and\nnature is transformed and reorganized under capitalistically constituted\nsocial relations. Through his discussion of real subsumption, Marx finally\nattained an understanding of the\n\n‘mode of production’ that was adequate to his own methodological dualism.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 151\n\nHowever, this new insight created a tension with his earlier view of\n‘historical materialism’ formulated in the Preface to his _Critique of\nPolitical Economy_.\n\n**iv**\n\n**caPitalist Mode of ProductioN aNd**\n\n\n## **historical MaterialisM**\n\nAlthough there were important theoretical developments in Marx’s _Capital_ and\nother economic manuscripts in the 1860s compared with the _Grundrisse_ , one\nshould not overemphasize their discontinuity. In fact, Marx’s concept of the\n‘productive force of capital’ already appears in the _Grundrisse_. He wrote,\nfor example:\n\nAs the infinite urge to wealth, it strives consistently towards infinite\nincrease of the productive forces of labour and calls them into being. But on\nthe other hand, every increase in the productive force of labour …\n\nis an increase in the productive force of capital and, from the present\nstandpoint, is a productive force of labour only in so far as it is a\nproductive force of capital. ( _Grundrisse_ : 341)\n\nMarx also wrote about the productive forces of capital in relation to\ncooperation and division of labour:\n\nLike all productive powers of labour, i.e. those which determine the degree of\nits intensity and hence of its extensive realization, the association of the\nworkers – the cooperation and division of labour as fundamental conditions of\nthe productivity of labour – appears as the productive power of capital. (\n_Grundrisse_ : 585)\n\nFrom these passages, one might even think that there is no decisive change in\nMarx’s argument, but that is not the case.13\n\nIn this context, it is worth referring to the analysis conducted by Japanese\nMarxist scholar Sadao Ohno (1983: 295),14 because he maintains that Marx’s\nconceptualization of the ‘mode of production’ in the _Grundrisse_ was still\ninsufficient. According to Ohno, Marx’s discussion in the 1850s did not\nsufficiently include the material side of production, although he had paid\nattention to the social and formal aspects that consists of the social\nrelations of capital and wage-labour. This insufficiency, Ohno argues, has to\ndo with the fact that Marx’s concept of ‘cooperation’ was not yet established\nas the elementary category of capitalist production in the _Grundrisse_.15 In\nthe _Grundrisse_ , Marx wrote about the mode of production without mentioning\ncooperation: ‘Productive capital, or the mode of production corresponding to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n152 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ capital, can be present _in only two forms_ :\nmanufacture and largescale industry’\n\n( _Grundrisse_ : 585; emphasis added). It was only _after_ the 1860s that Marx\npaid sufficient attention to the concept of ‘cooperation’, which also\ncontributed in deepening his understanding of the ‘mode of production’ (Ohno\n1983: 296).\n\nWhat is the mode of production? Generally speaking the ‘mode of production’ is\nunderstood as consisting of ‘relations of production’ and\n\n‘productive forces’. Yet, following Marx’s methodological dualism, one should\nrather say that the ‘mode of production’ is conditioned both socially and\nmaterially. On the one hand, the social aspects express its formal economic\nside, which is determined by ‘relations of production’ founded on the social\nrelations of capital and wage-labour. In this aspect, the capitalist mode of\nproduction is fundamentally characterized by ‘commodity production’ as well as\nby ‘production of surplus value’. The capitalist mode of production\npresupposes social relations in which workers are exploited by capitalists,\nand this relationship must be constantly reproduced in the process of capital\naccumulation. On the other hand, the ‘relations of production’ also contain\nmaterial aspects as a way of organizing the metabolism between humans and\nnature, which consists of cooperation, division of labour and large-scale\nindustry.\n\nMarx’s notebook to be published in the _MEGA_ IV/17 confirms this point.16 In\nFebruary 1859 when Marx took up the task of continuing writing chapter 3 of\n_Critique of Political Economy_ , he made excerpts from various books on\npolitical economy. Marx took notes from works by Richard Jones\n\nand Edmund Potter, and their arguments prompted him to focus on the category\nof ‘cooperation’ as a foundation of capitalist production. For example, Marx\nmade an excerpt from the following paragraph in Potter’s annotation to\nScrope’s _Political Economy_ (1833):\n\nThe principle here referred to is usually called the _division of labour_.\n\nThe phrase is objectionable, since the fundamental idea is that of _concert_\nand _cooperation_ , not of _division_. The term of division applies only to\nthe process; this being subdivided into several operations, and these being\ndistributed or parcelled out among a number of operatives. It is thus a\n_combination of labourers_ effected through a _subdivision of processes_.\n(IISG\n\nSig. B 91a: 109; emphasis in original)17\n\nHere Marx recognized the difference between ‘division of labour’ and\n\n‘cooperation’ and to the latter’s unique role in capitalism. One can also\ndiscern this shift in his excerpts in the same notebook from Jones’s _Textbook\nof Lectures_ _on the Political Economy of Nations_ (1852), where he documented\nthe following passage about cooperation in the Oriental state that made\npossible giant construction projects such as the Pyramids and the Great Wall:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 153\n\n_The number of the labourers, and the concentration of their efforts\nsufficed_. We see mighty coral reefs rising from the depths of the ocean into\nislands and firm land, yet each individual depositor is puny, weak and\ncontemptible.\n\nThe non-agricultural labourers of an Asiatic monarchy have little but their\nindividual bodily exertions to bring to the task; but _their number is_ _their\nstrength_ , and the power of directing theses masses gave rise to the palaces\nand temples, the pyramids and the armies of gigantic statues, of which the\nremains astonish and perplex us. It is that _confinement of the_ _revenues\nwhich feed them, to one or a few hands, which make such undertakings_\n_possible_. (IISG Sig. B 91a: 152; emphasis in original) The point is that\nwhile cooperation, as the most basic form of social labour, is\ntranshistorical, capitalism utilizes it in a unique manner. Both Potter and\nJones helped Marx to comprehend both the transhistorical and the historical\ndimensions of cooperation.\n\nOhno argues that Marx’s new insight into cooperation is reflected in the new\nplan for his project of political economy that was written after the\npublication of _Critique of Political Economy_ in spring/summer 1859 (Ohno and\nSatake 1984: 22). In contrast to the _Grundrisse_ , Marx for the first time\nincluded the category of ‘cooperation’ in his plan as part of the analysis of\nthe production of relative surplus value. Marx wrote in the _Draft Plan of\nthe_ _Chapter on Capital_ :\n\n3) Relative surplus value\n\na) Cooperation of masses\n\nb) Division of labour\n\nc)\n\nMachinery\n\n( _MECW_ 29: 511)\n\nThis clearly indicates that Marx came to assign cooperation as the elementary\nform of capitalist production in relation to the real subsumption of capital.\n\nThis change is important for the current investigation. If the role of the\nmaterial aspect of the mode of production was still ambivalent in the\n_Grundrisse_ – which also means that his methodological dualism of _Form_ and\n_Stoff_ was not yet clearly established – it is understandable that his\nanalysis of ‘real subsumption’ as well as of the ‘productive forces of\ncapital’ was also missing. When he successfully integrated the material\ntransformation and reorganization of the labour process into his theory of the\nreal subsumption, Marx was able to develop his analysis of the capitalist mode\nof production in a way that is consistent with his methodological dualism.\n\nThis is not a minor point. Although Marx’s theory of ‘cooperation’ in\n_Capital_ is often neglected, one should not underestimate its importance. It\nimplies a decisive break with the traditional view of historical materialism.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n154 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ According to the traditional view based on\nthe Preface to _A Contribution_ , two elements, the ‘productive forces’ and\nthe ‘relations of production’, are directly connected to each other, forming\nthe ‘mode of production’.18 Marx himself expressed their relationship in\nstating that ‘relations of production correspond\n\n[ _entsprechen_] to a given stage in the development of their material forces\nof production’ ( _MECW_ 29: 263).19 This statement is basically consistent\nwith what Marx and Engels wrote in _The German Ideology_.20 However, in the\npreface to the first edition of _Capital_ in 1867, Marx modified his\nformulation, writing ‘the capitalist mode of production, and the relations of\nproduction\n\n… that correspond [ _entsprechen_] to it’ ( _Capital_ I: 90). This change\nlooks very subtle, but Marx must have carefully formulated the beginning of\n_Capital_ , volume I. In fact, this change reflects the important shift in\nMarx’s view of history related to real subsumption and cooperation.\n\nIn accordance with the traditional view of historical materialism, Marx in the\npreface to _A Contribution_ continued to argue: At a certain stage of\ndevelopment, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with\nthe existing relations of production or –\n\nthis merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property\nrelations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto.\n\nFrom forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into\ntheir fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the\neconomic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole\nimmense superstructure. ( _MECW_ 29: 263) Accordingly, in the traditional\nconception of historical materialism, the increase of productive forces is the\nindependent variable and the driving force of historical progress; after they\nreach a certain point, the contradiction between the productive forces and the\nrelations of production explodes to transform the latter, leading to the\nformation of another mode of production.\n\nAs G. A. Cohen (2000: 135) succinctly puts it in his defence of historical\nmaterialism, ‘changes in productive forces brings about changes in production\nrelations’. Consequently, there emerged a common assumption that the increase\nof productive forces is a necessary and sufficient conditions for a post-\ncapitalist society. Such an assumption easily results in a productivist view\nof historical progress that treats the productive forces as the main driver of\nhistory and aims to unlock them from their capitalist fetters. The traditional\nview fetishizes the productive forces developed under capitalism, regarding\nthem as if they were neutral forces that can be taken over by the proletariat\nand utilized for establishing a socialist society. What is missing here is an\nanalysis of the real material transformation of the labour process under\ncapitalist relations of production that ‘corresponds to’ the capitalist mode\nof production.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 155\n\nThe same problem appears in the _Grundrisse._ It is precisely in the section\n\n‘Fragment on Machines’ where Marx actually referred to the concept of\n\n‘productive forces of capital’. Nevertheless, his insufficient attention to\nthe material aspect of the labour process cannot avoid a productivist tone. As\ndiscussed earlier, he believed that new technologies ‘blow this foundation\n\n-high’. It is no coincidence that Marx talked positively about the conquest of nature by science and technology in the same context: In the production process of large-scale industry, by contrast, just as the conquest of the forces of nature by the social intellect is the precondition of the productive power of the means of labour as developed into the automatic process, on one side, so, on the other, is _the labour of the_ _individual in its direct presence posited as suspended individual, i.e. as social,_ _labour. Thus the other basis of this mode of production falls away._ ( _Grundrisse_ : 709; emphasis in original)\n\nHere one can find the basic logical structure of historical materialism\nfuelled by the development of productive forces. Combined with the idea of the\nanachronism of value thanks to increasing material wealth, the _Grundrisse_\ncomes close to the breakdown theory of capitalism (Heinrich 2012: 176).21 It\nis difficult to deny Marx’s latent Promethean idea of the domination of nature\nin the _Grundrisse_ , which is incompatible with environmentalism.22\n\nHowever, Marx’s Prometheanism should not be overgeneralized (Löwy 2017: 11).\nIn the 1860s, when he consciously distanced himself from his earlier\ntechnocratic productivism, Marx was compelled to rethink his optimistic view\nof history and to reflect more seriously upon its negative implications. This\nself-critical reflection took place as he investigated the material aspect of\nthe production process unique to capitalist production, especially how\nmaterial world – human and non-human – is reorganized by capital’s initiative\nin favour of its own accumulation. This is because the increase of productive\nforces subordinate workers to command of capital more effectively. If so,\n\n‘relations of production’ and ‘productive forces’ cannot be simply separated\nas assumed in the traditional view of historical materialism. The development\nof productive forces of capital is dependent upon the thorough reorganization\nof human metabolism with nature in the form of cooperation, division of labour\nand machinery. In this sense, the ‘mode of production’ expresses a particular\nsocial arrangement of the material elements of production. That is why in the\npreface to _Capital_ , Marx set himself the task of examining ‘the capitalist\nmode of production, and the relations of production … that correspond to it’\ninstead of treating ‘productive forces’ as an independent variable as was the\ncase in the preface to _A Contribution_.\n\nThis change concerning the ‘mode of production’ might be discounted as a minor\nphilological quibble, but its theoretical significance should _not_\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n156 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ be underestimated because it has to do with\nthe transformation of Marx’s vision of post-capitalism. When the development\nof productive forces is not purely formal and quantitative, but is deeply\nrooted into the transformation and reorganization of the labour process, one\ncan no longer assume that a socialist revolution could simply replace the\nrelations of production with other ones after reaching a certain level of\nproductive forces. Since the ‘productive forces of capital’ that emerge\nthrough the real subsumption are materialized and crystalized in the\ncapitalist mode of production, they disappear together with the capitalist\nmode of production. In this sense, we need to radically reverse the\ntraditional historical materialist view about the actual relationship between\nproductive forces and relations of production: ‘ _Relations of production_\n_determine productive forces_ ’ (Tairako 1991: 60; emphasis in original).\n\nThis is how the establishment of the concepts of ‘productive forces of\ncapital’ and ‘real subsumption’ compelled Marx to abandon his earlier\nformulation of historical materialism in the preface to _A Contribution_.\nSince both aspects of _Form_ and _Stoff_ are closely entangled with each other\ndue to the real subsumption of the labour process23 it is not possible to\nchange one without simultaneously changing the other. This complexity would\nnot occur if the productive forces of capital were simply dependent upon\nmachines.\n\nThey could be utilized in socialism as before. However, the productive forces\ndeveloped under capitalism are tightly connected to the uniquely capitalist\nway of organizing the collaborative, cooperative and other social aspects of\nlabour.24 If so, the transcendence of the capitalist mode of production must\nbe a much more radical and thoroughgoing one than the mere abolition of\nprivate property and exploitation through the re-appropriation of the means of\nproduction by the working class. It requires the radical reorganization of the\nrelations of production for the sake of freedom and autonomy among associated\nproducers, so that the productive forces of capital disappear.\n\nOtherwise, despotic and ecologically destructive forms of production will\ncontinue in post-capitalist society. Yet when the productive forces of capital\ndisappear, the productive forces of social labour are diminished as well.\n\nThe concept of ‘real subsumption’ thus marks a radical shift in Marx’s\nevaluation of the progressive character of capitalism. In _Capital_ , he was\nno longer able to endorse the progressive character of capitalism. André Gorz\nrecognized this point when he wrote:\n\nIn other words, the development of productive forces within the framework of\ncapitalism will never lead to the gate of Communism, since the technologies,\nthe relations of production and the nature of the products exclude not just\nthe durable, equitable satisfaction of needs but also the stabilization of\nsocial production at a level commonly accepted as _sufficient_. (Gorz 2018:\n110–11)\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 157\n\nMészáros argued similarly, pointing to the necessity of rejecting the ‘\n_false_ _identification_ of commendable productive development, idealized as\nunquestionably desirable “ _growth_ ” in general, with the _fetishistic\nabsolute_ of increasingly more destructive _capital-expansion_ ’ (Mészáros\n2012: 257; emphasis in original).\n\nMore concretely, there are four reasons for the incompatibility of capitalist\ncooperation and socialist cooperation. First, productive forces of capital\ncannot be properly transferred to post-capitalism because they are created in\norder to subjugate and control workers. Since the socialist organization of\nthe labour process must be much more democratic and egalitarian, it is likely\nthat the system of production developed under capitalism can no longer be\neffectively conducted in a future society without the command and supervision\nof capital.\n\nIt is hard to imagine how the same order of things could be utilized under\ndemocratic control by freely associated producers. Rather, once capital’s\ninitiative and responsibility is dismantled, ‘productive forces of capital’\n\ndisappear together with their alien character. However, if the productive\nforces developed under the capitalist mode of production do _not_ provide a\nmaterial foundation for post-capitalism, this undermines the general thesis of\nhistorical materialism that presupposes that the ‘transition from the\ncapitalist to the socialist mode of production demands the scrupulous\npreservation of capitalist technics’ (Venable 1945: 95). On the contrary, the\nabolition of the despotic regime of capital may even require the _downscaling_\nof production.25\n\nSecond, capitalist technologies are not suitable to the socialist requirement\nof reunifying ‘conception’ and ‘execution’ in the labour process.26\n\nAs Braverman (1998) argued, this separation constitutes the condition of\nrelation of production that is _peculiar_ to the capitalist mode of\nproduction.\n\nCorrespondingly, knowledge and technology developed under capitalism serve to\nrealize the despotic domination of capital over workers, weakening their\nindependence and autonomy in the production process through standardization\nand simplification of tasks. André Gorz distinguishes two types of technology\nhere: ‘open technologies’ and ‘locking technologies’.\n\nAccording to Gorz, open technologies are ones that ‘promote communication,\ncooperation and interaction’ on a wide scale. In contrast, locking\ntechnologies under capitalism are those that ‘enslave the user’ and\n‘monopolize the supply of a product or service’ (Gorz 2018: 8–9).27 Capitalism\ntends to develop locking technologies. Democratic control under socialism\ndemands that they be replaced with open technologies in order to establish\nwholly different relations of production. While left accelerationism\npresupposes the harmonious incorporation of capitalist technologies into\nsocialist production, many of the locking technologies need to be abandoned\nfor the purpose of more https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published\nonline by Cambridge University Press\n\n158 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ egalitarian and autonomous production. In\nother words, the development of open technologies must start from scratch in\nmany cases.28\n\nThird, there is the problem of sustainability. Marx repeatedly warned that the\ncapitalist development of productive forces undermines and even destroys the\nuniversal metabolism of nature. As long as the capitalist mode of production\nis driven by the logic of valorization, its reorganization of the material\naspects of the labour process degrades the material conditions of general\nproduction.\n\nThis is why Marx argued that capitalist increase of productive forces is tied\nto\n\n‘a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the\nsoil’\n\n( _Capital_ I: 638). Accordingly, Marx demanded in volume III of _Capital_\nthat a future society must ‘govern the human metabolism with nature in a\nrational way’ ( _Capital_ III: 959). It is clear that the development of\nproductive forces of capital do not prepare the conditions for such a\nsustainable regulation of the metabolism with nature. In other words, even if\nthe ‘fetter’ of the development of productive forces is overcome through the\ntranscendence of the capitalist mode of production, capitalist technologies\nremain unsustainable and destructive and cannot be employed in socialism.\n\nFinally, the problems of these locking and destructive technologies cannot be\novercome simply by transferring ownership from capitalists’ hands to state (or\ncommunal) ownership. In this sense, the widespread identification of socialism\nwith state-ownership – and capitalism with private ownership – is insufficient\nfor Marx. If only formal subsumption had taken place, it would be possible to\nabolish the system of exploitation and to make a transition to socialism\nrelatively easily. However, when the ‘productive forces of capital’\n\nmust be transformed into ‘productive forces of social labour’, the transfer of\nownership alone does not solve the problem. If the separation of ‘conception’\n\nand ‘execution’ continues, a bureaucratic class would rule general social\nproduction instead of capitalist class, so the alienated condition of the\nworking class would basically remain the same. Environmental destruction would\nalso continue under bureaucratic rule. In other words, the real subsumption\nposes a difficult problem of free ‘socialist management’, for which the\ntraditional view of historical materialism does not provide any clue (Tairako\n1991).\n\nObviously enough, these four problems are not easy to solve, as the disastrous\npast failures of really existing socialism have demonstrated. Today’s\n(eco)socialism cannot simply utilize the productive forces of capital as the\nbasis for a future society. If so, post-capitalism can no longer be\ntheoretically founded upon the _Grundrisse_. Marx had serious trouble in\nsolving the inherent problems in his earlier formulation of historical\nmaterialism. What is more, Marx was not able to provide a definitive answer to\nthese problems even in _Capital_ , so we need to go beyond it.\nNotwithstanding, it is precisely these presuppositions of traditional Marxism\nthat have resurfaced among contemporary utopians due to their one-sided focus\non the _Grundrisse_.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 159\n\n**v**\n\n\n## **electoralisM aNd techNology as ideology**\n\nDespite these theoretical difficulties, automation utopians assume that\ntechnologies growing out of capitalism can provide the foundation for a\npostcapitalist society and realize universal human emancipation. Compared to\nMarx’s treatment of ‘productive forces of capital’, their claim is closer to\nthe view that Engels put forward in _Socialism: Utopian and Scientific_ :\n\n... now modern industry, in its more complete development, comes into\ncollision with the bounds within which the capitalistic mode of production\nholds it confined. The new productive forces have already outgrown the\ncapitalistic mode of using them. And this conflict between productive forces\nand modes of production … exists, in fact, objectively, outside us,\nindependently of the will and actions even of the men that have brought it on.\nModern Socialism is nothing but the reflex, in thought, of this conflict in\nfact. ( _MECW_ 24: 307) In addition to points clarified in Chapter 2, this is\nyet another important theoretical difference between Marx and Engels that\nemerged in the 1860s. In fact, Engels’s view expressed in this passage\ncontinues to treat the development of productive forces as an independent\nvariable. Engels did not fully comprehend the importance of Marx’s theory of\nreal subsumption and productive forces of capital. He thus continued to argue:\nThus, the products now produced socially were not appropriated by those who\nhad actually set in motion the means of production and actually produced the\ncommodities, but by the capitalists. The means of production, and production\nitself, had become in essence socialized.…\n\nThe greater the mastery obtained by the new mode of production over all\nimportant fields of production and in all manufacturing countries ...\n\nthe more clearly was brought out the incompatibility of socialized production\nwith capitalistic appropriation. ( _MECW_ 29: 309–10) It sounds as if once the\nprivate property of the means of production is abolished, workers could simply\ntake over capitalist production and transform it into a socialist one because\nproduction is already ‘in essence socialized’ under capitalism. Reducing the\nproblem of capitalism to private property, Engels avoided the difficult\nquestions concerning the new social management of productive forces under\nsocialism. Engels’s view became commonplace for traditional Marxism, and it is\nrepeated even today in the seemingly radical theories that highlight the\nrevolutionary potentialities of new information technologies and robotics.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n160 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Contemporary utopians only consider the\nefficiency and the abundance of goods and services without sufficiently taking\ninto account the qualitative and material side of production, that is, the\nautonomy and independence of workers and the sustainability of the natural\nenvironment. Their vision of an economy of abundance based on market-driven\ninnovations ends up reinforcing the real subsumption under capital and easily\nturns into the means of further expropriation from nature and surveillance\nover workers. Since alienation of work cannot be overcome in this way, fully\nautomated post-capitalism propagates an alternative hope that everyone keeps\ndriving electronic SUVs, changing smartphones every two years and eating\ncultured meat hamburgers. Such a vision of the luxury future obviously sounds\nattractive to many people in the Global North because ecological modernization\nassures them that they do not need to change anything about their extravagant\nlifestyle. This kind of abundant future appeals to the satisfaction of\npeople’s immediate desires without challenging the current imperial mode of\nliving in the Global North. The problem is, however, that such a vision\naccepts too uncritically existing value-standards and consumerist ideals.\n\nIt ends up reproducing the social relations marked by oppression, inequality\nand exploitation that are inherent to capitalism.\n\nParadoxically, hidden under the optimistic tone of this technocratic vision is\nactually a pessimistic ‘capitalist realism’ that holds that there is no strong\nclass struggle to challenge the existing social relations and to fundamentally\ndetach from the capitalist mode of living. People are deprived of the power to\ntransform the system, and this is why technology must play a central role to\nfill the void left by agency. In fact, this transformation can be implemented\nwithout strong social movements, and its promise of a comfortable life appear\nattractive. Such a productivist vision of post-capitalism ends up endorsing\ncapitalist value-standards under the guise of a grandiose emancipatory project\nfor infinite production and consumption. It gives up the revolutionary\nsubjectivity of the working class and accepts the reified agency of machines\nas the subject of history.\n\nHowever, such a post-capitalist project is compelling only when it\ndemonstrates how the productive forces of capital can be transformed into\nproductive forces of social labour that truly enable the ‘full development of\nthe individual’.\n\nSince the automation utopians avoid the problem of production, they focus on\nthe sphere of ‘politics’, which pivots around the idea of ‘left populism’\n\n(Mouffe 2018). Utopian socialists claim that they are not technological\ndeterminists by emphasizing the importance of constructing a new ‘political\nsubjectivity’ for a social change, especially through electoral politics.29\nBastani openly argues for ‘electoralism’ as a way of transforming society to\n‘fully automated luxury communism’: ‘FALC, embedded within a luxury populism,\nmust engage in a mainstream, electoral politics’ (Bastani 2019: 195).30\nBastani’s assumption here is that ecomodernist technologies can be utilized\nfor the sake https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 161\n\nof socialist transformation once their ownership is transferred to the state,\nbut this assumption is ungrounded.\n\nIn this context, Ellen Meiksins Wood’s critique of post-Marxism applies to\nBastani’s electoralism too (E. Wood 1986: 114–15). According to Wood, the\ntheoretical apparatus of left populism is determined by ‘the logic of\nelectoral politics’: ‘The new “true” socialism is intended not as a strategy\nfor transforming society but as a programme for creating a parliamentary\nmajority.’\n\nSuch a political programme presumes an ideological view of the ‘neutrality’\nand\n\n‘universality’ of the liberal democratic state. This view, however, by failing\nto transform the sphere of social production, misses the limitation of\ndemocracy itself. In other words, politics alone is not able to change society\nbecause the extension of democracy to the economic realm will face an\ninsurmountable limit when it comes to challenging and undermining the power of\ncapital. This is why a socialist strategy cannot simply focus on the autonomy\nof the political but needs to transform the sphere of social production: ‘At\nleast, the full development of liberal democracy means that the further\nextension of popular power requires not simply the perfection of existing\npolitical institutions but a radical transformation of social arrangements in\ngeneral, in ways that are as yet unknown’ (E. Wood 1986: 150). Technological\nacceleration alone does not provide a way of overcoming the barrier imposed by\ncapital. It is too narrow to count as the radical change in social\narrangements that are required for establishing a post-capitalist society. It\neven risks turning into a means of reinforcing the despotic power of capital\nover society.\n\nIn fact, it is not clear how the productive forces of capital can be\ntransformed into democratic power in the process of accelerating them. It is\nmore likely that this will only further exacerbate the separation between\n‘conception’\n\nand ‘execution’. Without social struggles, the model of constructing counter-\nhegemony based on technological development is likely to become a project of\nimposing social transformation ‘from above’. Intellectuals, technocrats and\npoliticians come up with the ideas for realizing policies as they are supposed\nto know better in terms of how to effectively manage and mitigate the\necological and economic crisis. They will monopolize the power of decision-\nmaking about which technologies to use and how to use them. Although\nscientific knowledge is undoubtedly indispensable, centralized and gigantic\nlocking technologies, by their very nature, do not lend themselves to\ndemocratic control because they require top-down policies and management.31\nEven the mitigation of the ecological crisis becomes a means of subordinating\nindividuals to undemocratic and technocratic command from above. This is why\nGorz warned that a project of Promethean modernism would end in the ‘negation\nof both politics and modernity’ (Gorz 2018: 48). This risk cannot be\nunderestimated after the failure of the avant-garde socialist model in the\n20th century.32\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n162 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ In addition, the novelty of new technologies\ncan obscure the real problem that it is precisely the continuation of business\nas usual that is irrational.\n\nTechnology functions as an ideology that mystifies this irrationality. In\nother words, technology suppresses and eliminates the possibilities of\nimagining a completely different lifestyle and a safe and just society in the\nface of the economic and ecological crisis. Crisis is supposed to be a\ncatalyst for critical self-reflection on our irrational behaviour and for\nenvisioning a different future that is more democratic, egalitarian and\nsustainable. However, locking technologies deprive us of the imaginaries and\ncreativities needed to go beyond capitalism. The ideology of technology is one\nof the reasons for the poverty of imagination that pervades contemporary\ncapitalism. Automation utopia is one manifestation of this problem.\n\nDespite disagreeing with them, this chapter devoted many pages to the\nautomation utopians because they, at least, have shown that ‘abundance’\n\nand ‘luxury’ are dangerous for capitalism. They correctly grasp that the price\nmechanism of the market is based on scarcity, and abundance seriously disturbs\nthis mechanism, opening up the possibility of a post-scarcity economy.\n\nAbundance is also important to envision an attractive post-capitalist future\nas an anti-thesis to neoliberal austerity. In order to radically challenge\ncapitalist consumerism and productivism in the age of global ecological\ncrisis, Marxist theory, however, needs to redefine ‘abundance’ because its\ntraditional usage is incompatible with objective ecological limits. As the\ntheoretical limitations of automation utopians show, Marx’s _Grundrisse_\ncannot fulfil this task due to its remnant Prometheanism, so it is necessary\nto look elsewhere. Fortunately, Marx came to critically reflect upon this\nproblem of his own historical materialism and attempted to reformulate his\nvision of post-capitalism after the l860s.\n\nMarx’s serious attempt continued throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Instead of\ngoing back to works such as the _Grundrisse_ and _A Contribution_ that predate\n_Capital_ , it is thus more fertile to examine Marx’s writings _after_ 1868 in\norder to envision a post-capitalist and post-scarcity future in the\nAnthropocene that is radically different from ‘fully automated luxury\ncommunism’.\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nIn this chapter, I also use the term ‘utopian socialism’ instead of ‘left\naccelerationism’\n\nbecause the figures mentioned here do not necessarily categorize themselves as\n\n‘accelerationists’. Christian Fuchs (2016) uses the term ‘utopian socialism\n2.0’ in order to characterize Paul Mason’s vision of post-capitalism.\nObviously, there are various theoretical differences among the contemporary\nutopian socialists, and there are aspects that contribute to the utopian post-\ncapitalist vision of this book discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 163\n\n2\n\nFor a compelling critique of the exaggerated threat of full automation from a\nMarxist perspective, see Benanav (2020). In this sense, left accelerationism\ndoes not have a solid empirical foundation. Benanav also shows some sympathy\nfor its utopian vision for post-capitalism, while proposing another vision of\nthe post-scarcity society that is compatible with my own view discussed in the\nnext two chapters.\n\n3\n\nThis vague image of ‘Leninism’ has actually nothing to do with Lenin’s ideas.\nIt is more adequate to call it ‘digital Stalinism’.\n\n4 They also desperately look for a job and accept low-paid and precarious jobs\nlest they suffer from the stigma of unemployment in order to live up to\ncapitalism’s work ethic. A strong work ethic is precisely what makes modern\nwage-labourers ‘more productive’ than premodern slaves and bondsmen. In fact,\nMarx argued that while slaves ‘work only under external compulsion’, ‘the free\nworker can only satisfy the requirements of his existence to the extent that\nhe sells his labour; hence is forced into this by his own interest, not by\nexternal compulsion’ ( _MECW_ 30: 198). Modern workers sell their labour power\nbased on their free will for the sake of satisfying their own needs, which\nmakes them more industrious and responsible to the command of capital. They\naccept the logic of self-responsibility after ‘freely’ signing the contract\nwith capitalists as their equal partners.\n\n5\n\nIncidentally, it is not clear how Mason’s passionate celebration of\ninformation technology in Postcapitalism (2015) can be compatible with his\nstraightforward defence of humanism in _Clear Bright Future_ (2019).\n\n6\n\nThe popularity of this manuscript is not new, as it has been a key text for\nItalian Marxists such as Antonio Negri, Mario Tronti and Paolo Virno. The\ncontemporary utopian socialists update this tradition in a form that is\nadequate to the age of information technology.\n\n7\n\nMarx was aware that what counts as ‘necessary’ for the reproduction of labour\npower changes with the development of productive forces. He wrote in the\n_Grundrisse_ that\n\nwhat previously appeared as a luxury is now necessary, and that so-called\nluxury needs appear e.g. as a necessity for the most naturally necessary and\ndown-to-earth industry of all. This pulling-away of the natural ground from\nthe foundations of every industry, and this transfer of its conditions of\nproduction outside itself, into a general context – hence the transformation\nof what was previously superfluous into what is necessary, as a historically\ncreated necessity – is the tendency of capital.\n\n( _Grundrisse_ : 527–8)\n\n8 Matteo Pasquinelli (2019) traces Marx’s concept of ‘general intellect’ as\noriginating from William Thompson’s _An Inquiry into the Principles of the_\n_Distribution of Wealth_ (1824). Furthermore, he argues that this concept was\nreplaced by _Gesamtarbeiter_ in _Capital_. This is possible, but considering\nthe fact that his view of capitalist development significantly changed between\nthe https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n164 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ _Grundrisse_ and _Capital_ , it is not merely\na choice of different words with the same meaning.\n\n9\n\nG. A. Cohen ([1978] 2000: 104) as well as Cassegård (2021: 5) adequately grasp\nthis method as Marx’s unique conception central to his critique of political\neconomy.\n\n10 In the _Economic Manuscripts of 1861–63,_ Marx also incorporates the\nintensification of labour into the production of absolute surplus value, while\nin _Capital_ Marx discusses the issue in relation to relative surplus value.\nIn my view, this change is adequate. This modification reflects Marx’s\nawareness that the intensification of labour is only possible based upon the\nreal subsumption of labour.\n\n11 Obviously, Marx used the term in the sense of productivity too. For\nexample, he wrote:\n\nBut [labour time required for the production] changes with every variation in\nthe productivity of labour. This is determined by a wide range of\ncircumstances; it is determined amongst other things by the workers’ average\ndegree of skill, the level of development of science and its technological\napplication, the social organization of the process of production, the extent\nand effectiveness of the means of production, and the conditions found in the\nnatural environment. For example, the same quantity of labour is present in\neight bushels of corn in favourable seasons and in only four bushels in\nunfavourable seasons. ( _Capital_ I: 130)\n\n12 In this sense, one can define the ‘productive forces’ as the ability of\nhumans to consciously regulate their metabolism with nature.\n\n13 One may also point to Marx’s following remark in the _Grundrisse_ : The\nsimplest form, a form independent of the division of labour, is that capital\nemploys different hand weavers, spinners etc. who live independently and are\ndispersed over the land. (This form still exists alongside industry.) Here,\nthen, the mode of production is not yet determined by capital, but rather\nfound on hand by it. ( _Grundrisse_ : 586) Based on these remarks, one could\nargue that Marx had utilized the concept of\n\n‘productive forces of capital’ and distinguished ‘real’ and ‘formal’\nsubsumption already in the _Grundrisse_. Yet that underestimates Marx’s\ntheoretical development after the _Grundrisse._ It does not suffice to simply\npoint out the appearance of the term because it is possible that the same term\nhas a different degree of importance and a different role for Marx.\n\n14 Raya Dunayevskaya (1973: 80) argued that Marx’s break with theory initially\ntook place in his decision to include the lengthy chapter on the working day\nin volume I of _Capital_ to highlight the importance of the struggle for\nshortening the working day. However, this is not necessarily convincing\nbecause Marx always planned to write such a chapter, and her claim leads our\nfocus on the production of absolute surplus value instead of relative surplus\nvalue. As Marx came to pay more attention to the actual organization of the\nlabour process, a decisive shift occurred in his theory of cooperation.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 165\n\n15 Obviously, Marx used the concept of ‘cooperation’ in the _Grundrisse_ , and\nhe did so even in _The_ _Poverty of Philosophy_. This does not contradict the\nclaims made in this chapter. Cooperation obviously has a transhistorical\ndimension. The point is that Marx did not clearly treat cooperation as the\nelementary form of capitalist production until the early 1860s.\n\n16 This notebook was not available to Ohno, although my argument here\nbasically follows his ideas. The volume _MEGA_ IV/17 that contains this\nnotebook is currently being edited by the Japanese team, including myself.\nMarx’s original notebooks are available online:\nhttps://search.iisg.amsterdam/Record/\n\nARCH00860/ArchiveContentList#A072e534c62 (accessed 7 September 2022).\n\n17 This passage is later utilized by Marx in his _Economic Manuscripts of\n1861–63_.\n\nSee _MEGA_ II/3: 251. See the List of Abbreviations for the reference to\nMarx’s archival materials.\n\n18 This traditional view is not a misinterpretation of Marx’s text. It is a\ncorrect interpretation of the preface, but it misses the later development of\nMarx’s own view.\n\n19 The translation is modified following the German original text.\n\n20 There Marx and Engels wrote: ‘The form of intercourse [that is, relations\nof production] determined by the existing productive forces at all previous\nhistorical stages, and in its turn determining these, is civil society’ (\n_MECW_ 5: 50; emphasis added). They continue to argue: ‘In the development of\nproductive forces there comes a stage when productive forces and means of\nintercourse are brought into being which, under the existing relations, only\ncause mischief, and are no longer productive but destructive forces’ ( _MECW_\n5: 52). Here Marx and Engels expressed the view that productive forces\ndetermine the historical stage of human society and endorsed the possibility\nthat once the ‘fetter’ is got rid of, the development of productive forces can\ncontinue in a socialist society.\n\nThe problem is that Marx and Engels did not acknowledge the possibility that\nsocialism does _not_ automatically make productive forces sustainable but that\ntheir development continues to become ‘destructive forces’.\n\n21 See the _Grundrisse_ (705):\n\nAs soon as labour in the direct form has ceased to be the great well-spring of\nwealth, labour time ceases and must cease to be its measure, and hence\nexchange value [must cease to be the measure] of use value.\n\nThe _surplus labour of the mass_ has ceased to be the condition for the\ndevelopment of general wealth, just as the _non-labour of the few_ , for the\ndevelopment of the general powers of the human head. With that, production\nbased on exchange value breaks down.\n\n22 This problem is also related to Marx’s notorious Eurocentric endorsement of\nthe ‘great civilising influence of capital’ (see Löwy 2019). This problem will\nbe discussed in the next chapter.\n\n23 Tairako (2017) calls this penetration of the economic form to the material\naspect of things ‘thingification’ ( _Verdinglichung_), distinguishing it from\n‘reification’\n\n( _Versachlichung_). He follows Marx’s own usage of these two concepts.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n166 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ 24 While Marx did not directly mention it in\nthis context, the capitalist mode of production is also accompanied by\nparticular flows of natural resources and energy with the aid of science and\ntechnology. This needs to change in the course of deconstructing the\nproductive forces of capital.\n\n25 Obviously enough, this was not a possibility for traditional Marxists. The\nremaining option then becomes the bureaucratic control of social production\nafter the disappearance of productive forces of capital, which led to the\nfailure of this Soviet path. The central topic of the next two chapters is the\nneed to downscale and slowdown production in order not to repeat the same\nfailure.\n\n26 Another problem of productivism is that the increase of quantitative\nproduction can be maximized with technologies that end up subjugating human\nsubjectivity and strengthening the inversion between the subject and the\nobject. This is because the criterion of abundance alone does not tell what\nkind of technology post-capitalism should actively employ. In fact, the\nanalysis of the real subsumption showed how the autonomy of workers is\nundermined under the despotic regime of capital precisely for the sake of\nincreasing productivity by reorganizing the entire labour process.\nEcosocialism needs to develop counter-technologies which aim to endow workers\nwith the autonomous ability to regulate and coordinate the labour process even\nafter the capitalist function of supervision and command disappears.\nOtherwise, it risks the concentration of power in the hands of the few: people\nmay be equal but unfree. The deprivation of autonomy can take place outside\nthe domination of capital. State ownership can be introduced simply for the\nsake of realizing equality, which has resulted in brutal conformism. For\nexample, in the context of the development of information technology\ncelebrated by utopian socialists, algorithms can significantly increase\nproductivity by effectively adjusting and directing social cooperation.\nHowever, when algorithm functions based on big data are utilized without the\ncontrol and knowledge of workers, they will be controlled by the commands of\nthe algorithm. These commands are totally alien to the workers because they do\nnot know how this algorithm is working on them. If you are a taxi driver, you\nhave a certain set of knowledge based on your experience as a driver. You\nknow, for example, which road to choose in order to get more customers or to\navoid crowded roads at a certain hour. This is what provides you with a degree\nof autonomy in work. But, when the GPS in taxis starts to collect data related\nto drivers’ actions, the company can analyse the big data – how they drive and\nwhich roads they use, and so on. Then, the platformers can monopolize the\nknowledge of the taxi drivers. Based on algorithms formulated through big\ndata, companies can introduce a new computer system that orders each driver\nwhich way to go. Capital can replace those old taxi drivers with autonomous\nknowledge with anyone with a driver’s licence without any previous experience\nwho simply follows the directions shown on their smartphone display. This is a\nnew form of real subsumption as the separation of ‘conception’ and ‘execution’\n\nin the age of information technology. Braverman’s insight remains valid under\ndigital capitalism.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Revival of Utopian Socialism and the Productive Forces of Capital_ | 167\n\n27 Nuclear power and geo-engineering are prime examples of ‘locking\ntechnology’.\n\nThey make it impossible to democratically control the ecological system.\nRather, the political decision of the developed countries will decide on\nirreversible interventions in the climate and ocean system, eliminating the\npossibility of regaining autonomous ways of organizing the metabolic\ninteraction between humans and nature in the future.\n\n28 Gorz does not negate the possibility of open technologies in capitalism.\nHis optimistic view of the Internet as an open technology, however, appears\nnaïve today in the face of the formation of ‘surveillance capitalism’ (Zuboff\n2019).\n\n29 What Srnicek and Williams (2016: 15) call ‘folk politics’ is characterized\nby the small-scale and horizontal assembly, based on the model of direct\ndemocracy.\n\nThe ‘assembly’ aims at the immediate and temporal achievement of civil\njustice.\n\nAccording to them, folk politics typically gives up challenging worldwide\nissues and the global economic system and instead aims at ‘prefigurative\npolitics’ that takes place at a face-to-face local level. Apparently, this\nscaling down of political ambition is the result of the failure of Soviet\nsocialism and the corresponding formation of neoliberal common sense. Srnicek\nand Williams argue that local movements such as local food movements and\nOccupy Wall Street lack any efficacy because the issues that they are trying\nto solve are deeply rooted in the global capitalist system and the planetary\necological system. What is direly needed, Srnicek and Williams argue, is a\nuniversal project for progress and emancipation as a counter-hegemonic\nproject. The problem is, however, the full automation that they advocate for\nundermines such subjectivity.\n\n30 While accelerationism is a communist version of electoralism, ecomodernism\npresents a ‘social democratic’ version of electoralism that advocates state\nregulation and intervention in the capitalist market. Thus, Jonathan Symons\n(2019: 12) also argues for the importance of ‘state-driven innovation’ because\nthe state is ‘the only actor with the capacity and social mandate to take on\nsuch a role’. There is no reason to deny the central importance of the state\nin the process of mitigating the climate crisis, but ecomodernism is not the\nonly way to utilize state power. I have no intention of defending ‘folk\npolitics’ here either.\n\nNevertheless, a one-sided focus on technologies often mystifies the irrational\nand exploitative character of the current system. Folk politics at least\nchallenges the current mode of living in the Global North in search of a more\nsolidaristic mode of living with those people in the Global South (Brand and\nWissen 2021).\n\n31 Such political decisions will likely reinforce the existing asymmetry of\npower. As noted earlier, if geo-engineering is introduced in such a manner, it\nis justified in the name of stewardship of the earth and aims to manage the\nentire ecological system at the cost of enslaving people – especially in the\nGlobal South through the metabolic shift – to heteronomous regulation by\ntechnologies. That is incompatible with climate justice.\n\n32 Similarly to Srnicek and Williams’s critique of ‘folk politics’, Andreas\nMalm (2020) argues for ‘ecological Leninism’. While his intention is fully\nunderstandable, Leninism does not solve the problem of productive forces of\ncapital either.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.006 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n**Part III**\n\n\n## **towards degrowth coMMuNisM**\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n**6**\n\n\n## **Marx as a Degrowth Communist**\n\n**The _MEGA_****and the Great Transformation after 1868**\n\nThrough discussions in previous chapters, various productivist approaches\ncharacteristic of Marxism turned out to be inadequate to formulate a response\nto the economic and ecological crises of the Anthropocene. Technocratic\nvisions, despite their bold claims of emancipation, reproduce the non-\ndemocratic and consumerist relations of domination and subjugation that exist\nunder capitalism.\n\nFurthermore, capitalist development does not guarantee the transcendence of\nthe contradictory character of the capitalist mode of production because\n\n‘productive forces of capital’ as an art of robbery severely deform the human\nmetabolic relationship with nature, without providing a material foundation\nfor the future society. This is not a new problem. In the 1860s Marx became\nincreasingly aware of this problem while writing _Capital_ , but due to the\npersistent understanding of the philosophical foundations of Marx’s historical\nmaterialism as the unilateral progress of universal human history driven by\nthe development of productive forces, his vision of revolution tended to be\nreduced to a Promethean one, as if the maximal acceleration of the existing\ntendencies of capitalism could ultimately realize a final leap to communism.\n\nMarx’s own remarks reinforce this impression. Even in the well-known passage\nfrom the preface to _A Contribution_ in 1859, Marx famously wrote, for\nexample: ‘No social formation is ever destroyed before all the productive\nforces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior\nrelations of production never replace older ones before the material\nconditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old\nsociety’\n\n( _MECW_ 29: 263). This kind of assumption can easily be read as productivist,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n172 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ but such an interpretation is untenable today\nbecause the acceleration of productive forces will sooner or later make most\nof the planet inhabitable before the collapse of capitalism.\n\nIt is understandable that environmentalists often show disdain for Marxism. In\nfact, historical materialism is unpopular today. This is a pity considering\ntheir shared interest in criticizing capital’s insatiable desire for\naccumulation, though from different perspectives. Admitting the inadequacy and\nflaws of Promethean Marxism, this chapter attempts to finally resolve the\ntension between Red and Green. By revisiting Marx’s own texts, I re-examine\nwhether a path exists to reconcile the long antagonism between Green and Red\nand to build a new Front Populaire in defence of the planet in the\nAnthropocene. Such a re-investigation is worth conducting because the ongoing\nproject of publishing the complete works of Marx and Engels, _Marx-Engels-\nGesamtausgabe_ ( _MEGA_), has made possible a more nuanced reconstruction of\nMarx’s thinking process. His notebooks published in the fourth section of the\n_MEGA_ are of great use for the current investigation.\n\nAlthough these notebooks were mostly treated as ‘mere’ excerpts even by\nserious Marxist scholars, together with his letters and manuscripts they\ncontain ideas and insights that were not fully integrated into his published\nwritings.1 Because Marx barely published after volume I of _Capital_ (1867)\nand its volumes II and III remained unfinished, his notebooks are valuable\ndocuments that shed light on unknown aspects of his unfinished project of\npolitical economy.\n\nIn short, the _MEGA_ is not just for biographers who want more detailed\ninformation about Marx’s and Engels’s life. Rather, it has important\n_theoretical_ implications. Combined with Marx’s economic manuscripts\npublished in its second section, the _MEGA_ sets up the conditions for a new\ncritical investigation of Marx’s critique of capitalism. In fact, there have\nbeen novel attempts to reconstruct the late Marx based on the _MEGA_ in recent\nyears (K. Anderson 2010; Heinrich 2013; Vollgraf 2016; Jones 2016; Saito 2017;\nMusto 2020). They reveal that Marx quite intensively studied two fields after\nthe publication of _Capital_ : natural science and pre-capitalist or non-\nWestern societies. Based on the new materials published in the _MEGA_ , Kevin\nAnderson (2010) demonstrates Marx’s departure from his earlier Eurocentric and\nlinear view of historical progress, while Carl-Erich Vollgraf (2016) argues\nthat Marx’s passionate engagement with natural science indicates his serious\nconcern about environmental destruction under capitalism (I).\n\nHowever, no matter how important these recent discoveries of Marx as a ‘non-\nethnocentric’ and ‘ecological’ thinker may be for Marxist scholars who wish to\nsave him from various accusations directed against him, they\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 173\n\nare not sufficient to demonstrate why _non-Marxists_ still need to care about\nMarx’s interest in ecology today. In order to demonstrate why non-Marxists\nshould still care about Marx, Marxian scholars need to offer something more\npositive here. This chapter goes further than previous literature by\nconcretely depicting the late Marx’s vision of post-capitalist society after\nhe abandoned Eurocentrism and Prometheanism in the 1870s. In finally\ndiscarding both ethnocentrism and productivism, Marx abandoned his earlier\nscheme of historical materialism. It was not an easy task for him. His\nworldview was in crisis. In this sense, Marx’s intensive research in his last\nyears was a desperate attempt to reconstruct and reformulate his materialist\nconception of history from an entirely new perspective, resulting in a\nradically different conception of the alternative society (II).\n\nFamously enough, Marx’s serious engagement with non-Western society after 1868\nmade him recognize the revolutionary potentialities of non-Western societies\nbased on communal landed property. This shift is clearly discernible in his\nfamous letter to Vera Zasulich and his call for an immediate Russian\nRevolution bypassing the capitalist stage in Russia. Previous studies paid\nattention to the letter to Zasulich and its drafts (Wada 1975; Shanin 1984; J.\nWhite 2019), but their description of Marx as a non-Eurocentric thinker alone\nsounded ‘romantic’ as long as the high evaluation of Russian communes is tied\nto the understanding that the old Marx, giving up hope of a revolution in\nWestern Europe, strongly sympathized with revolutionary movements in Russia.\nObviously enough, romanticism does not offer any convincing reason why it is\nuseful to go back to the late Marx today (III).\n\nTo demonstrate the contemporary relevance of Marx’s theory, it is necessary to\nelaborate on his positive vision of the post-capitalist society. The\nrevolutionary potentiality of Russia, about which he learned through his\nintellectual communication with Russian authors such as Nikolay Chernyshevsky\nand Maxim Kovalevsky, not only inspired him to rethink the Russian path to\ncommunism but also enriched his view of communist society _in_ _Western\nEurope_. However, previous studies failed to sufficiently examine this point\nprecisely because they did not pay attention to Marx’s interest in ecology\nafter 1868. In short, Marx’s final vision of an alternative society can be\ndeveloped only based upon a full synthesis of Marx’s engagement with political\neconomy, ecology and pre-capitalist societies in the last 15 years of his\nlife. By carefully investigating the reason why he had to study pre-capitalist\nsocieties _and_ natural sciences at the same time, a new and surprising\npossibility of interpreting Marx’s letter to Zasulich emerges: Marx ultimately\nbecame a _degrowth communist_ (IV).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n174 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ **i**\n\n**the _MeGa_****aNd the late Marx**\n\nRecent discussions on the late Marx based on the _MEGA_ offer unique insights\ncompared with previous interpretations. According to a stereotypical account\nof Marx’s theory of revolution, economic inequality increases under capitalism\nbecause workers’ surplus labour is appropriated by capitalists. Capitalists,\ndriven by market competition, aim to increase productive forces by introducing\nnovel machines and produce a greater number of commodities than ever. However,\nworkers who are severely exploited cannot afford to consume all of the new\ncommodities. _Capital_ continues to expand the market to find new demand.\n\nHowever, ‘new markets were not limitless and the more exploitation was pursued\nthe greater was the likelihood that what seemed like overproduction would\nactually happen’ (Lamb 2015: 48). Overproduction results in a sudden fall in\ncommodity prices, bankruptcy and mass employment, which degrades the living\nconditions of the working class even more. Ultimately, the proletariat,\ndeveloping class consciousness as a universal revolutionary class, unites and\nstands up against the capitalists; ‘the expropriators are expropriated’.\n\nOne might say that this description very roughly summarizes the basic logic of\n_The_ _Communist Manifesto_ of 1848. The _Manifesto_ seethed with\nrevolutionary optimism, and its tone reflects Marx’s and Engels’s conviction\nthat capitalism would soon be transcended through a socialist revolution\ntriggered by a severe economic crisis. Since the further development of\ncapitalism prepares the way for an ever-greater economic crisis, it is\nprobable that Marx thought it necessary to accelerate capitalism’s development\ndespite the negative side-effects of such a crisis, including economic\ninequality and the further degradation workers’ living conditions. However,\nthe revolution of 1848 failed, and capitalism was revived thereafter. That was\nalso the case after the economic crises in 1857 and 1866. After all, economic\ncrises alone have never brought about the breakdown of capitalism. An economic\ncrisis is actually an integral part of capitalist development as it\nannihilates value to prepare new conditions for a next industrial cycle\n(Kliman 2011). Repeatedly confronted with the stubbornness of capitalism, Marx\ngradually corrected his optimistic view about the inevitability of a socialist\nrevolution. Thus, no matter how accessible and encouraging the story told in\n_The Communist Manifesto_ might be, it does not necessarily reflect Marx’s\ndefinitive vision (Sasaki 2021).\n\nIn this sense, we must surely deal with his magnum opus, _Capital_ , but the\npoint is that even that is not sufficient because _Capital_ remains\nessentially an unfinished work. One needs to go _beyond_ it in order to\ncomprehend Marx’s final vision of post-capitalist society.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 175\n\nHowever, traditional Marxism was often satisfied with Marx’s theory of surplus\nvalue and exploitation in _Capital_ , volume I. This served as ‘proof ’\n\nof the illegitimate domination of the bourgeoisie and the legitimacy of\nproletarian revolution. His theory of crisis in volumes II and III were\nlikewise understood as a ‘proof ’ of the inevitability of capitalism’s\ncollapse. _Capital_ was celebrated as a socialist ‘bible’ to ground both the\nlegitimacy and the necessity of socialism, but such a reading is not\ncompelling today and the failure of traditional Marxism is not necessarily a\nnegative thing to lament. The end of the Cold War also opened up new\npossibilities for rereading Marx. What characterizes this ‘new reading of\nMarx’ ( _neue Marx-Lektüre_) compared with traditional Marxism is an honest\nacknowledgement of the incompleteness of his system of political economy.\nScholars started to investigate his economic manuscripts, letters, and even\nnotebooks more carefully (Dellheim and Otto Wolf 2018). They demonstrate that\nalthough volumes II and III of _Capital_ were not completed during Marx’s\nlifetime, his critique of capitalism did deepen after the publication of\nvolume I. However, the unfinished character of Marx’s critique of political\neconomy has been underestimated in the past because it became invisible in\nEngels’s edition of _Capital_. Engels, editing Marx’s manuscripts after his\ndeath, strove to establish ‘Marxism’ as a doctrine to mobilize the working\nclass. He tended to overemphasize the systematic character of _Capital_ so\nthat it could provide a universal ‘worldview’ for the working class.\n\nAs a consequence, Marx’s thinking processes are sometimes obscured in Engels’s\nedition. This is unfortunate because it is precisely those passages in the\noriginal manuscript for volume III, where Marx had most difficulties and\nplanned to come back later to rework them, that had to be modified by Engels\nfor the sake of improving the readability of Marx’s text _as a book_. These\npassages are usually hard to read as Marx struggled to formulate his new ideas\nin writing. They are often accompanied by redundant repetitions, vague\nformulations and grammatical errors. Marx often used the mark ‘L’ in the\nmanuscripts to denote where he started over his argument. Or, when he felt the\nneed to come back later to elaborate more, he highlighted those passages in\nthe notebooks by drawing lines in the margins.2 However, all these traces of\nstruggle were ‘cleaned up’ by Engels.3 Of course, thanks to Engels’s enormous\nefforts, _Capital_ in three volumes became available in a form that is\naccessible to a broad audience (if not easily comprehensible to the working\nclass). This enabled ‘Marxism’ as a doctrine of ‘scientific socialism’ to\nexert an enormous political influence throughout the 20th century. While\nEngels’s achievement is undeniable, it is also true that the new theoretical\nhorizon that looms in Marx’s economic manuscripts became rather invisible\ngiven the impression https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published\nonline by Cambridge University Press\n\n176 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Engels’s edition gives that the three volumes\nof _Capital_ are more or less complete in their current form. Consequently,\nMarxists often assumed that Marx’s research after 1867 has little meaning\nbecause it hardly contributed to volumes II and III of _Capital._ This is also\nreflected in the widespread view that the late Marx lost his intellectual\ncapacity due to illness. Isaiah Berlin provides a typical example when he\nconcludes that the late Marx ‘was less capable of the active campaigns of his\nyouth and middle years; overwork and a life of poverty had finally undermined\nhis strength; he was tired, and often ill, and began to be preoccupied by\nhealth’ (Berlin [1948] 2013: 252–3).\n\nHowever, as the _MEGA_ publishes the economic manuscripts of _Capital_ in its\nsecond section, as well as relevant notebooks in the fourth section, it\nbecomes clear that despite his worsening health, Marx quite passionately\nstudied new materials and wrote various manuscripts for the sake of completing\n_Capital_.\n\nAs an attempt to refine and revise his system of political economy even after\n1868, Marx conducted a lot of calculations of the profit rate related to the\nlaw of profit rate to fall ( _MEGA_ II/4.3; _MEGA_ II/14; Akashi 2021). He\nalso tried to reconsider the theory of crisis in the face of the panic of 1866\n\n( _MEGA_ IV/19; Graßmann 2022) as well as the theory of ground rent ( _MEGA_\nIV/18). Looking at the economic manuscripts, Michael Heinrich (2013: 167) even\nargues that due to the rise and increasing influence of the United States, as\nwell as Russia, which volume I of _Capital_ barely took into account,\nespecially with regard to joint stock companies and the impact of railway\nconstruction, Marx was no longer certain whether England could be treated as a\nmodel of capitalism as an ideal type. Heinrich believes that this new economic\nsituation compelled Marx to consider a reconstruction of the logical structure\nof _Capital_ almost from scratch. Likewise, Carl-Erich Vollgraf concludes his\nanalysis of Marx’s notebooks on natural science by claiming that Marx came to\nrecognize the ‘value-producing’ contribution of nature in the production\nprocess and realized that he must abandon the labour theory of value (Vollgraf\n2016: 129). Heinrich and Vollgraf maintain that due to the enormous scale of\nsuch a theoretical reconsideration, Marx’s unfinished project became\n_unfinishable._\n\nWhile Heinrich’s and Vollgraf ’s statements exaggerate the theoretical and\npersonal crisis Marx and his project faced after 1868 – he never explicitly\nadmitted what they claim to be the case – their investigation of the _MEGA_ ,\nfocusing on the neglected aspects of the late Marx, correctly points to the\nnecessity for a thorough re-examination of his critique of political economy.\n\nNevertheless, these discussions on the _MEGA_ remain largely unknown outside\nGermany and Japan. As a result, even those scholars, who do not naively take\n_The Communist Manifesto_ as Marx’s definitive view, often fail to recognize\nthe endpoint of his intellectual journey, especially with regard to his vision\nof post-capitalism. This chapter aims at revealing what the late Marx actually\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 177\n\nenvisioned as an alternative to capitalism in a way that opens up new debates\nwith contemporary currents of political economy and political ecology in the\nAnthropocene.\n\n**ii**\n\n\n## **decoNstructiNg historical MaterialisM**\n\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, Marx underwent a significant theoretical\nshift after he brought his attention to bear on the problem of ‘productive\nforces of capital’ in his analysis of the ‘real subsumption’ in the _Economic\nManuscripts_ _of 1861–63._ This shift made him thoroughly rethink his previous\nassumption about the progressive character of capitalism. He realized that\nproductive forces do not automatically prepare the material foundation for new\npostcapitalist society but rather exacerbate the robbery of nature. However,\ndue to the neglect of the concept of ‘productive forces of capital’, there\nremains a common misunderstanding that Marx continued to naively presume a\n\n‘progressive view of history’ comparable to a natural law: ‘Marx adopted\nHegel’s view that history was … a development, which, like the growth of a\nplant, proceeded ineluctably according to its own laws’ (Perry 2015: 343).\n\nMarx, like Hegel, becomes a passionate defender of linear progress in human\nhistory driven by the dialectical development of productive forces, which\nshould dialectically bring about human emancipation despite its initially\ndestructive impacts upon communities and the natural environment.\n\nNo wonder then that Marx’s ‘historical materialism’ is repeatedly criticized\nfor its economic determinism (Popper 1967). Economic determinism has two main\ncharacteristics: ‘productivism’ and ‘Eurocentrism’. Productivism is\ncharacterized by an optimistic endorsement of capitalist modernization because\ntechnological and scientific inventions and innovations introduced under\nmarket competition lead to the elimination of poverty and shorter working\nhours. The affluent life that was hitherto limited to a small number of the\nruling class becomes available to the working class. Since the development of\nproductive forces counts as the main driver of historical progress, the\nacceleration of capitalist development becomes the _most efficient_ path\ntowards human emancipation.\n\nSuch a productivist vision simultaneously presupposes a linear progress of\nhistory. It regards the Western capitalist countries with higher productive\nforces as located on a higher stage of history compared to non-Western and\nnon-capitalist countries. It follows that other non-capitalist countries\n_must_ follow the same European path of capitalist industrialization in order\nto establish socialism. This kind of uncritical presupposition of the\nsuperiority of https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n178 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Western Europe as it imposes its own history\nupon other parts of the world makes Marx’s thought ‘Eurocentric’ (Avineri\n1969: 29).\n\nNeedless to say, both productivism and Eurocentrism are untenable today.\n\nSome of these criticisms of Marx are justifiable. _The Communist Manifesto_\ncontains passages where his and Engels’s ethnocentric productivism is\ndiscernible in their writing about ‘the subjugation of nature to man’ and the\n\n‘barbarian and semi-barbarian countries’:\n\nThe bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has\ncreated enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as\ncompared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the\npopulation from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country\ndependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries\ndependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois,\nthe East on the West. ( _MECW_ 6: 488) Marx and Engels continued to argue:\n\nThe bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more\nmassive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding\ngenerations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery,\napplication of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation,\nrailways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation,\ncanalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground –\n\nwhat earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces\nslumbered in the lap of social labour? ( _MECW_ 6: 489) Fascinated by new\ntechnologies, Marx praised the development of the productive forces under\ncapitalism and hoped that the subjugation of nature would civilize the entire\nworld and realize human emancipation. As far as these statements are\nconcerned, it is fair to say that Marx was both Promethean (Löwy 1998) and\nEurocentric (Carver 1983: 80).4\n\nHowever, what Marx said in the _Manifesto_ should not be overgeneralized\nbecause he later critically reflected upon both of these problematic\nassumptions. As I have pointed out throughout this book, the existence of\nMarx’s ecology is undeniable today as seen in recent robust discussions that\nemploy his concept of metabolic rift. Although some ecosocialists caution that\nthe role of Liebig’s _Agricultural Chemistry_ in Marxian ecology should not be\noveremphasized because it is based on outdated science of the 19th century\n(Engel-Di Mauro 2014), Marx’s ecological investigation of natural science did\nnot end with Liebig. Marx was well aware that Liebig’s work alone did _not_\nprovide sufficient scientific ground for a critique of ecological degradation\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 179\n\nunder capitalism. After 1868, Marx thus intensified his study of the natural\nsciences, including those who explicitly _criticized_ Liebig’s treatment of\nsoil exhaustion and chemical fertilizer. The scope of Marx’s research\ndocumented in his notebooks is astonishing, and his notebooks cover topics in\ngeology, chemistry, mineralogy, and botany. These notebooks document that his\necological critique of capitalism went beyond Liebig’s critique of robbery\nagriculture, covering new topics such as excessive deforestation, cruel\ntreatment of livestock, squandering of fossil fuels and species extinction\n(Saito 2017).\n\nAs already mentioned in Chapter 2, Marx eagerly read the work of the German\nagronomist Carl Fraas in 1868, who was a harsh critic of Liebig’s exaggerated\nclaim that soil exhaustion was the cause of decay in civilizations.\n\nInstead, Fraas (1847) in _Klima und Pflanzenwelt_ warned that excessive\ndeforestation was a real threat to modern European civilization because it\nwould change the local climate. Rising temperatures and dryness would have\nnegative impacts on indigenous plants as well as agriculture, ultimately\nleading to the collapse of ancient civilizations. He was concerned that the\ndevelopment of logging and transportation technologies under capitalism would\nallow the felling of trees previously inaccessible or unprofitable,\naccelerating the tempo and scale of deforestation ( _MEGA_ IV/18: 621).5 This\nmarks a decisive expansion in Marx’s ecological understanding.\n\nMarx also knew about William Stanley Jevons. Jevons’s warning about the\nexhaustion of the British coal caused heated controversy in the British\nParliament at the time. Marx, who was carefully following various newspapers\nand magazines, came to learn of the debate and acquired a copy of Jevons’s\n\n_The Coal Question_. In a notebook made in 1869, which was recently published\nin _MEGA_ IV/19, Marx actually read Jevons’s treatment of the coal question.6\n\nAs documented in Marx’s notebook, Jevons warned about the ‘probable\nexhaustion’ of coal reserves ‘in 100 years’.7 He predicted that Britain would\nbe at a disadvantage in the international competition with the United States\nbecause ‘their coal is often better in quality and incomparably more\naccessible than ours’. Marx recognized that while ‘ _great economy in the use\nof coal_[has been] already introduced’, the consumption of coal kept\nincreasing because of its cheap price. This constitutes ‘the Jevons Paradox’.\n\nIn the same notebook of 1869, he went on to cover other ecological topics too.\nMarx, for example, read articles published in the _Economist_ on the\nrinderpest epidemic in Great Britain between 1865 and 1867. At the time, meat\nconsumption was growing, and the fattening of domestic animals for meat and\nprofit intensified. As he noted from the _Economist_ dated 10 February 1866:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n180 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Year by year the amount of meat consumed in\nthe country augments.\n\nFollowing shows how rapidly the trade is augmenting: **Number of living\nanimals imported in the 11 months ended November 30**\n\n**1863**\n\n**1864**\n\n\n## **1865**\n\nOxen, bulls and cows\n\n89,518\n\n141,778\n\n196,030\n\nCalves\n\n36,930\n\n44,678\n\n48,926\n\nSheep and lambs\n\n380,259\n\n412,469\n\n763,084\n\nSwine and hogs\n\n24,311\n\n68,777\n\n117,766\n\n( _MEGA_ IV/19)\n\nMarx documented the following passage about the relationship between\n\n‘cattle plague’ and a modern system of breeding obsessed with fattening of\ncows:\n\nMr. Cousmaker said: ‘too much importance could not be attached to the system\nof breeding … they ought to combine the breeding of stocks with its fattening:\nfattening.’ ‘He had himself escaped the cattle plague, although violently\nraging in his neighbourhood. In August and September they had lost in his\nparish 270 head of cattle. One of the causes of this escape was that he had\nnot for years bought stock. He bred at one end and fattened on the other, and\nhe never bought or sold, except to the butcher, beyond buying about once every\n2 years a yearling bull, for the sake of change of breed....’ ( _MEGA_ IV/19)\nMarx already studied Léonce de Lavergne and Wilhelm Hamm in 1864\n\non how modern livestock farming increases the vulnerability of animals to\ndisease because these animals are kept inactive in a closed space for the sake\nof speedier maturity with excessive fat. Marx’s comments are quite critical of\nsuch ‘improvements’ and sympathetic to animal welfare. Responding to Léonce de\nLavergne’s enthusiastic reports about the ‘system of selection’\n\ndeveloped by English breeder Robert Bakewell, Marx wrote in his notebook:\n\n‘Characterized by precocity, in entirety sickliness, want of bones, a lot of\ndevelopment of fat and flesh etc. All these are artificial products.\nDisgusting!’\n\n( _MEGA_ IV/18: 234).8 In the notebooks of 1868, cattle plague provided Marx\nwith another more horrifying manifestation of the metabolic rift created by\nindustrial meat production. It does not end with the sacrifice of individual\nanimal welfare, but the spread of viruses that created pandemics in the entire\ncountry at that time.9\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 181\n\nFurthermore, Marx clearly recognized the multi-faceted development of the\necological problem. On the one hand, the rearing of a great number of cattle\nis also tied to soil exhaustion:\n\nThere is a very large area of grassland, which is in a very impoverished\ncondition. The land is grazed year after year; young cattle are reared, and\ndairy produce sold; but nothing is returned to the soil. It will not be long\nbefore the Irish farmer experiences that this system will end in the total\nexhaustion of the land. ( _MEGA_ IV/19)\n\nInstead of returning to the soil, soil nutrients contained in the food\nconsumed by the working class in the large cities was digested and then flowed\ninto the river through water closets as sewage. This was tied to the\ndegradation of living conditions in the city:\n\n‘We learn’, say the Commissioners, ‘with something approaching to dismay, that\none manufacturer alone employs from 1 to 2 tons of oxalic acid in bleaching\nstraw plaits, but are somewhat reassured upon consideration that the poisonous\ncharacter of this substance is entirely destroyed by admixture with the\ncarbonate and sulphate of lime contained in the water of the river.’ Then, the\nriver is polluted by sheep washing, and, as the preparation for dipping sheep\ncontains arsenic, another noxious ingredient is added to the new witches’\ncauldron.\n\nBut, besides these directly poisonous substances, the river receives the\nsewage of Hatfield, Hertford, Ware, Enfield, Barnet, and Tottenham.\n\n( _MEGA_ IV/19)\n\nThe foulness of waterways was a serious issue at the time, and every town\nblamed the town upriver. Sewage in the River Thames is known to have been the\ncause of the cholera outbreak of the 1830s, which persisted for over 20 years.\nA similar problem occurred even in the 1860s. Although based on articles in\nthe _Economist_ , Marx’s notebook of 1868 documents how he came to deal with\nthe ecological complex around modern food production consisting of water\npollution, soil exhaustion and pandemic disease. This insight marks a clear\nadvancement compared to his earlier reception of Liebig in 1864 that focused\nsolely on the problem of soil exhaustion.\n\nThe research objective that is discernible from Marx’s late notebooks is very\ndifferent from his earlier optimistic view. Abandoning his celebration of the\nincreasing productive forces under capitalism, he came to recognize that the\nsustainable development of the productive forces is not possible under\ncapitalism because it only reinforces intensive and extensive squandering and\nrobbery of human and nature for the sake of short-term profit and endless\ncapital accumulation, creating more complicated and extensive ecological\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n182 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ issues. The reparation of the metabolic rift\nnecessitates a different economic system, and this is the fundamental insight\nof Marx’s ‘ecosocialism’ in the 1860s.\n\nMarx’s endorsement of ‘ecosocialism’ in the 1860s certainly counts as a\nsignificant modification of his earlier view. Yet this theoretical shift is\nonly the beginning of a more profound change. Marx’s decisive break with\nproductivism shook his larger worldview called ‘historical materialism’.\nAbandoning productivism, Marx must have recognized that higher productive\nforces by themselves no longer automatically guarantee Western capitalism a\nhigher historical status compared with non-Western and non-capitalist\nsocieties.\n\nIt is not clear at all whether the development of destructive technologies\ncounts as ‘development’ towards free and sustainable human development.\n\nIn fact, in _Capital_ Marx characterized the power of capital to expropriate\nfrom nature as ‘robbery’ ( _Raub_). When Marx jettisoned productivism as the\nessential component of his view of human history, he was also compelled to\nreconsider his biased Eurocentrism, which is the other side of the same coin.\n\nFurthermore, if he ultimately discarded both productivism and Eurocentrism,\nMarx must have completely parted ways with ‘historical materialism’ as it has\ntraditionally been understood. In this case everything would have to start\nover again. It is easy to imagine that this was a painful task for the old\nMarx, but he did not give up his project as is demonstrated by his research on\nthe world history and non-Western/pre-capitalist societies.\n\nBefore reconstructing what happened to Marx’s vision of post-capitalism after\nhe consciously discarded historical materialism, it is useful to briefly\nsketch the problem of Marx’s Eurocentrism. The most famous criticism was\nraised by Edward Said, who characterized Marx as a typical ‘Orientalist’\n\nthat treats the non-Europeans as barbaric and inferior in order to legitimize\nWestern domination over them. Said wrote about Marx’s comments on British\ncolonialism in India published in the _New York Daily Tribune_ in 1853: In\narticle after article he returned with increasing conviction to the idea that\neven in destroying Asia, Britain was making possible there a real social\nrevolution.… Marx’s economic analyses are perfectly fitted thus to a standard\nOrientalist undertaking, even though Marx’s humanity, his sympathy for the\nmisery of people, are clearly engaged. Yet in the end it is the Romantic\nOrientalist vision that wins out, as Marx’s theoretical socio-economic views\nbecome submerged in this classically standard image. (Said 1979: 153–4)\n\nIndeed, Marx wrote in one of those articles titled ‘The British Rule India’:\nEngland, it is true, in causing a social revolution in Hindostan, was actuated\nonly by the vilest interests, and was stupid in her manner\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 183\n\nof enforcing them. But that is not the question. The question is, can mankind\nfulfil its destiny without a fundamental revolution in the social state of\nAsia? If not, whatever may have been the crimes of England she was the\nunconscious tool of history in bringing about that revolution.\n\n( _MECW_ 12: 132)\n\nCertainly, Marx acknowledged the brutality of British colonialism in India at\nthat time, but his tone is somewhat ambivalent. He maintained that British\ncolonialism ‘has to fulfil a double mission’ that is not only ‘destructive’\ntowards Indian villages but also ‘regenerating’ for Asian society by\nintroducing new technologies brought about by Western capitalism, such as\nrailways, steam engines and irrigation systems. Marx emphasized the\nprogressive role of British colonialism in terms of the dissolution of\ncommunal landed property and its replacement with private land ownership as\nwell as of the caste system through modern industrialization. This is because\nhe assumed that Indian village communes were stagnant and lacked all\ncommunication with the outside world and failed to take note of technological\ndevelopment and commodity production in precolonial India. He thus argued in\nanother article\n\n‘The Future Results of British Rule in India’ that Asian societies are static\nand passive by themselves, even claiming that ‘Indian society has no history\nat all’\n\n( _MECW_ 12: 217). For Marx, the ‘unchanging nature of non-European society is\nthus a drag on the progress of history and a serious threat to socialism’\n\n(Avineri 1969: 21) This is why, Marx argued, Indians needed compulsion from\nwithout through the imperialist intervention of European societies. It seems\nthat Marx accepted the sufferings of the Indian people as a necessary evil for\nthe general progress of humankind towards socialist emancipation.\n\nSaid’s critique of Orientalism sounds appropriate here.\n\nHowever, before too hastily accepting these accusations of Eurocentrism, it is\nworth pointing to a number of rebuttals of them (Ghosh 1984; Pradella 2016).\nOne can respond to Said’s criticism by arguing that already in the late 1850s,\nMarx more emphatically expressed his anti-colonialist and abolitionist\nposition and acknowledged the agency of the Indian people (Jani 2002: 94). For\nexample, Marx wrote about the Revolt of 1857 against British colonialism in\nIndia, asking readers ‘whether a people are not justified in attempting to\nexpel the foreign conquerors who have so abused their subjects’\n\n( _MECW_ 15: 341). This was not a one-off remark. Whether it was Indian\ncolonialism, the Polish Uprising, the American Civil War, or the Irish\nquestion, Marx always stood on the side of the oppressed and more clearly\ndenounced the brutality of imperialism and slavery under capitalism (K.\nAnderson 2010).\n\nThis does not necessarily mean that he fully distanced himself from\nEurocentrism. Actually, abolitionist remarks can be found already in the 1840s\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n184 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ when he wrote in _The_ _Poverty of\nPhilosophy_ that ‘direct slavery is just as much the pivot of bourgeois\nindustry as machinery, credits, etc’ ( _MECW_ 6: 167).10 In other words, it is\npossible that Marx, despite his hatred of and anger towards British\nimperialism, still believed in the passive and static character of non-Western\nsocieties. This can be characterized as a trait of Orientalism.\n\nIn fact, it is likely that Marx ultimately accepted colonial rule from the\nperspective of the progress of human history as a whole. Even though he\nstarted to pay attention to the destructive character of capitalist\ndevelopment of productive forces in the beginning of the 1860s, similar\n‘Orientalist’ remarks can still be found in the 1860s. For example, in the\n_Economic Manuscripts of_ _1861–63_ , Marx criticized Jean Charles Léonard de\nSismondi by arguing: To oppose the welfare of the individual to this end, as\nSismondi does, is to assert that the development of the species must be\narrested in order to safeguard the welfare of the individual, so that, for\ninstance, no war may be waged in which at all events some individuals perish.\nSismondi is only right as against the economists who conceal or deny this\ncontradiction.\n\nApart from the barrenness of such edifying reflections, they reveal a failure\nto understand the fact that, although at first the development of the\ncapacities of the human species takes place at the cost of the majority of\nhuman individuals and whole human classes, in the end it breaks through this\ncontradiction and coincides with the development of the individual; the\n_higher development of individuality is thus only_ _achieved by a historical\nprocess during which individuals are sacrificed_ ….\n\n( _MECW_ 31: 347–8; emphasis added)\n\nIncrease the productive forces, even if individuals are sacrificed! Market and\ncapitalism all over the world for human emancipation! It is as if Marx were an\nideologue of neoliberal globalization.\n\nFurthermore, it is not obvious whether Marx really abandoned his Eurocentrism\neven in volume I of _Capital_ , where he continued to talk about the\nstationary character of Asian societies: ‘This simplicity supplies the key to\nthe riddle of _the unchangeability of Asiatic societies_ ’ ( _Capital_ I: 479;\nemphasis added). In the 1850s, this passivity and steadiness were exactly the\nreasons Marx pointed to the need for European intervention in Asia from\nwithout.\n\nNon-Western societies remained deprived of historical agency, despite their\nessential contribution to the affluence of Western capitalism by supplying\nlabour power and natural resources.\n\nIn addition, Marx notoriously wrote in the preface to the first edition of\n_Capital_ : ‘The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to\nthe less developed, the image of its own future’ ( _Capital_ I: 91). Such a\nunilateral view of historical development counts as another trait of his\nEurocentrism, because it uncritically projects the trajectory of European\nhistory onto the rest of the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 185\n\nworld. Such a violent universalization of the particular justified\ncolonialism.\n\nThis kind of Eurocentric framework easily falls into a reductionist analysis\nof non-Western societies from the hegemonizing perspective of European\ncapitalism, marginalizing the specificities of local social relations. Thus,\nMarx’s emphasis on the universalizing tendency of capitalist development shows\n\n‘ambivalences’ (Chakrabarty 2000: 65) without paying sufficient attention to\nwhat resists the universal logic of capital. It is necessary, so Dipesh\nChakrabarty argues, to thoroughly reconstruct Marx’s view of history in a way\nthat does not erase contingencies and discontinuities in particular cases.\nThey cannot be explained using the universal law of capitalist development but\nhave essential impacts upon the history of both European and non-European\ncountries in the process of capital’s globalization.\n\nChakrabarty concludes that ‘Marx does not himself think through this problem’\n(Chakrabarty 2000: 67), but that is not necessarily the case.11 By the latter\nhalf of the 1860s at the latest, Marx reflected much more critically upon the\ndestructive character of Western intrusion into non-Western societies and the\nlimits to the universalization of capital. Instead of emphasizing the ‘double\nmission’, Marx problematized the asymmetrical subjugation of peripheral\nregions into the capitalist world system, which prevents them from achieving\nthe promised modernization process. This shift in his tone in the 1860s needs\nto be understood in relation to the new concept of ‘productive forces of\ncapital’, with which he reconsidered the progressive character of capitalism\nin general.\n\nAs a result, similarly to the sphere of ecology, a decisive shift occurred\nafter 1868 in terms of his treatment of non-Western societies. This revision\nbecomes apparent in his alliance with people in Ireland against English\ncolonial rule. In his letter to Engels dated 10 December 1869, Marx wrote: For\na long time, I believed it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by\nEnglish working class ascendancy. I always took this viewpoint in the _New\nYork Tribune. Deeper study has now convinced me of the opposite_.\n\nThe English working class will never accomplish anything before it has got rid\nof Ireland. The lever must be applied in Ireland. This is why the Irish\nquestion is so important for the social movement in general.\n\n( _MECW_ 43: 398; emphasis added)\n\nIn this letter, Marx clearly admitted that he changed his earlier view from\nthe 1850s, arguing that colonized Ireland plays a rather leading and _active_\nrole in the fight against English capitalism and imperialism without ascribing\na progressive role to England in pushing forward history in another region.\n\nThis marks his first explicit break from the logic of Eurocentrism. Although\nIreland is located within Western Europe, underlying this break was the fact\nthat Marx had started intensively studying not only natural sciences but also\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n186 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ non-Western and pre-capitalist societies\n_immediately_ _after_ the publication of volume I of _Capital_.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to suspect that Marx’s theoretical transformations\nregarding of Prometheanism and ethnocentrism occurred at the same time. This\ndual shift is a reflection of Marx’s parting way with historical materialism.\nOne should recall that in the same letter dated March 1868, in which Marx\nfound a ‘socialist tendency’ in Fraas’s work, he also found the same socialist\ntendency in Maurer’s work (see Chapter 2). At that time, he was simultaneously\nreading Fraas’s ecological investigation and Maurer’s historical analysis of\nTeutonic communes. These two research topics – natural science and pre-\ncapitalist/non-Western societies – are closely related in the late Marx.\n\nMarx was interested in Teutonic communes and their sustainability, and he\nstarted to spend more time studying various non-Western and precapitalist\nsocieties with a particular focus on non-capitalist agriculture and systems of\nlanded property. After 1868 Marx read books on ancient Rome, India, Algeria,\nLatin America, the Iroquois in North America and Russian agrarian communes.\nThe change of his view is clearly documented, especially with regard to\nRussia.\n\nEven in the late 1860s, Marx did not hide his dismissiveness not only of\nTsarist Russia but of Russian revolutionaries like Mikhail Bakunin.\n\nIn the first edition of _Capital_ , volume I, Marx mocked the Russian populist\nand Slavophile, Alexander Ivanovich Herzen, together with August von\nHaxthausen, a German historian who wrote extensively on Russian peasant\ncommunes and land reform:12\n\nIf on the continent of Europe the influence of capitalist production continues\nto develop as it has done up till now, enervating the human race by overwork,\nthe division of labour, subordination to machines, the maiming of women and\nchildren, making life wretched, etc., hand in hand with competition in the\nsize of national armies, national debts, taxes, sophisticated warfare etc.,\nthen the rejuvenation of Europe by the knout and the obligatory infusion of\nKalmyk blood so earnestly prophesied by the half-Russian and full Muscovite\nHerzen may become inevitable.\n\n(This belletrist, incidentally, has noted that he made his discoveries on\n\n‘Russian’ communism, not in Russia, but in the work of the Prussian Privy\nCouncilor Haxthausen.) ( _MEGA_ II/5: 625)13\n\nHere Marx did not recognize the revolutionary potentiality of Russian communes\nat all, dismissing Herzen’s romantic optimism. At the time, agrarian communes\ncalled ‘mir’ or _obshchina_ still existed in Russia, and there was also a\ngroup called the ‘Narodoniks’, who aimed for a socialist revolution against\nTsarism based on these agrarian communes. Among those Russian populists,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 187\n\nHaxthausen’s work had the most decisive impact. Nevertheless, Marx also wrote\nin his letter to Engels dated 7 November 1868: ‘The whole business [in the\nRussian communal system], down to the smallest detail, is absolutely identical\nwith the primaeval Germanic communal system…. The whole shit is breaking down’\n( _MECW_ 43: 154). Despite his intensive engagement with Maurer in March 1868,\nMarx at the time did not believe that primitive communism existing in the\nRussian communal system – Haxthausen ([1847–52] 1972) often compared the\nGermanic and Russian communes14 – could persist any longer, let alone function\nas a place of resistance to capitalist invasion from the West.\n\nMarx’s attitude towards Russia gradually changed, however, through his contact\nwith the Russian populist revolutionary movement. They not only wished to\ntranslate _Capital_ into Russian but also supplied him with recommendations\nabout writings on Russia. Prompted by them, Marx even started to learn Russian\nin November 1869, in order to get access to direct information about Russian\nsociety. He affirmatively read Nikolay Chernyshevsky’s _Outlines of Political\nEconomy According to Mill_ in summer 1870. Chernyshevsky was one of the main\nfigures in the Narodoniks who defended the significance of _obshchina_ for a\nRussian revolution as well as Haxthausen’s work. Marx was quite impressed by\nChernyshevsky’s works, even attempting to translate his political testament,\n_Letters without an_ _Address_ into German (IISG Sign. B112: 131–52). Another\nindication of Chernyshevsky’s influence upon Marx is that the dismissive\npassage on Herzen and Haxthausen disappeared in the second edition published\nin 1873. He instead praised Chernyshevsky’s _Outlines_ in the postface to the\nsecond edition: ‘… an event already illuminated in a masterly manner by the\ngreat Russian scholar and critic N. Chernyshevsky’ ( _Capital_ I: 98). This\nmodification implies that his attitude towards Russia somewhat shifted already\nbetween 1868 and 1872 (J. White 2019: 12), even if he was not yet fully\nconvinced of the revolutionary potentialities of Russian society.\n\nMarx also integrated the result of his new findings into the French edition of\n_Capital_. He emphasized the importance of this new French edition in his\nletter to Danielson dated 15 November 1878 about the second edition of the\nRussian translation of _Capital_ , suggesting that ‘the translator always\ncompare carefully the second German edition with the French one, since the\nlatter contains many important changes and additions’ ( _MECW_ 45: 343). In\nthe French edition of _Capital_(1872–5), Marx, for example, added a sentence\nin the chapter on ‘primitive accumulation’, in which he explicitly restricted\nthe scope of his analysis to Western Europe:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n188 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ At the core of the capitalist system,\ntherefore, lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of\nproduction ... the basis of this whole development is the expropriation of the\nagricultural producer. To date this has not been accomplished in a radical\nfashion anywhere except in England.... But _all the other countries of Western\nEurope_ are undergoing the same process. ( _MEGA_ II/7: 634; emphasis added)15\n\nConsidering his remark in the letter, it is clear that Marx quite consciously\nmodified this passage as a result of his engagement with non-Western\nsocieties.\n\nIn the same letter dated 15 November 1878, written shortly after Maxim\nKovalevsky’s visit to Marx in London, Marx wrote about the disputes on\n_Capital_ in Russia:\n\nOf the polemics of Tschischerin and other people against me, I have seen\nnothing, save what you sent me in 1877 (one article of Sieber, and the other,\nI think, of Michailoff, both in the _Fatherlandish Annals_ , in reply to that\nqueer would-be Encyclopedist – Mr Joukowski). Prof. Kowalewskiy, who is here,\ntold me that there had been a rather lively polemics on the _Capital_. (\n_MECW_ 45: 343–4)\n\nThe Russian translation of _Capital_ was published in March 1872, and it was\nquite successful, selling 3,000 copies within a year. While Kovalevsky\napparently exaggerated the scale of the polemics in Russia, the dispute that\nMarx referred to in this letter was initiated by a Russian Narodnik, Nikolay\nK. Mikhailovsky. It concerned whether socialism could be established in Russia\nwithout going through the stage of capitalism. This makes one passage in the\npreface to the first edition of _Capital_ problematic: ‘The country that is\nmore developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of\nits own future’ ( _Capital_ I: 91). The central question was whether this\ndescription would apply to Russia.\n\nAlthough he had written a positive review of _Capital_ in 1872 and continued\nto cherish its importance, Mikhailovsky later expressed doubts about the\napplicability of Marx’s historico-philosophical theory to Russia. In an\narticle titled ‘Karl Marx before the Tribunal of Mr Zhukovsky’ published in\nthe _Otechestvenniye Zapiski_ in November 1877, Mikhalovsky, while defending\nthe general theoretical validity of _Capital_ from Zhukovsky, doubted that\nRussia needed to go through the process of capitalist development in order to\nachieve the socialization of labour. Referring to Marx’s dismissal of Herzen\nin the first edition of _Capital_ , he problematized this dismissive attitude\ntowards the desperate attempt of Russians to save their suffering peasants\nfrom the catastrophic consequences of Tsarist government policies as well as\nof the capitalist invasion of Russia. The polemic continued when Nikolai\nSieber, a passionate defender of Marx’s _Capital_ , replied to Mikhalovsky in\nthe same https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 189\n\njournal, where he maintained that Marx’s description of history is universally\napplicable, and Russia is no exception (J. White 2019: 33).\n\nIn summary, Marx himself already confronted criticism for falsely imposing a\nEurocentric ‘universal’ law on non-Western societies in the form of these\nRussian critiques. Similar criticisms would be repeated many times in the 20th\ncentury. Marx attempted to respond to Mikhalovsky in November 1878.16 In this\nletter to the editorial board of the _Otechestvenniye Zapiski_ , Marx\nexplicitly denied that his rejection of Herzen’s Pan-Slavism immediately meant\nthe negation of a uniquely Russian path to socialism. In order to ground his\nclaim that Mikhalovsky misrepresents the logical structure of _Capital_ , he\ndrew upon his own treatment of Chernyshevsky in the postface to the second\nedition of _Capital_ as well as the modified passage in the French edition,\nwhich limits the scope of his discussion of the primitive accumulation to\nWestern Europe ( _MECW_ 24: 199). Marx continued to complain that Mikhalovsky\nhad distorted his own view:\n\nIt is absolutely necessary for him to metamorphose my historical sketch of the\ngenesis of capitalism in _Western Europe_ into a historico-philosophical\ntheory of general development, imposed by fate on all peoples, whatever the\nhistorical circumstances in which they are placed, in order to eventually\nattain this economic formation which, with a tremendous leap of the productive\nforces of social labour, assures the most integral development of every\nindividual producer.\n\n( _MECW_ 24: 200; emphasis added)\n\nMarx insisted upon the importance of studying particular the historical\ncontext of each society instead of taking a homogenizing approach within a\npre-given schema of private and communal property system based on the European\nexperience of the transition from feudalism to capitalism: ‘Thus events\nstrikingly analogous, but occurring in different historical milieu, led to\nquite disparate results.’ The dissolution of communal landed property, for\nexample, brings about different consequences depending on the historical and\nsocial context.\n\nIn this way, Marx maintained that his view was actually close to Mikhalovsky’s\nown. However, it is unfair to take recourse to the second edition of _Capital_\nto justify Marx’s ‘true’ intentions because such a view is not discernible in\nthe first edition upon which the Russian translation was based. Mikhalovsky\ndid not misunderstand _Capital_. On the contrary, it was Marx who changed his\nview after 1868 (Wada 1975: 110). In any case, Marx in the draft letter\nexpressed his own tentative conclusion in the following manner: ‘I have\narrived at this result: if Russia continues along the path it has followed\nsince 1861, it will miss the finest chance that history has ever offered\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n190 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ to a nation, only to undergo all the fatal\nvicissitudes of the capitalist system’\n\n( _MECW_ 24: 199). In Western Europe, the process of capitalist formation was\naccompanied by the transformation of peasants into proletarians, but this is\nnot inevitable in other regions. As long as there existed no mass proletariat,\nRussia would not necessarily follow the same law of capitalist development.\n\nThere was still a chance to avoid it, so Marx advocated for an immediate\nuprising in Russia.\n\nThis letter was never actually sent, and Engels found it in 1883 after his\ndeath. Marx was probably aware of the weakness of his critique of Mikhalovsky,\nand he was also afraid that his critique of Mikhalovsky would work negatively\nfor the Russian populists as well as create tension with Sieber, who was a\npassionate supporter of his views in Russia. However, Marx was destined to\nreturn to this question in the 1880s.\n\n\n## **iii**\n\n**the last Marx aNd his New idea of coMMuNisM**\n\nBetween 1879 and 1881, Marx engaged in the study of non-Western societies and\npolemics on the Russian revolution, which is documented in his so-called\n_Ethnological Notebooks_. In September 1879, Marx read Maxim Kovalevsky’s\n_Common Landownership: The Causes, Course and Consequences of Its Decline_\n(1879), a large part of which is dedicated to the analysis of Indian society.\nIn the following years, in addition to Lewis H. Morgan’s _Ancient Society_ ,\nhe also read _Java, or How to Manage a Colony_ (1861) by James Money; The\nAryan Village in India and Ceylon (1880) by John Phear; and _Lectures on the\nEarly_ _History of Institutions_ (1875) by the historian Henry Maine. Reading\nthese books, Marx studied how non-Europeans regulated property rights over\nmany years until their colonization by Europeans.\n\nFor example, Marx carefully followed Kovalevsky’s description about the\npersistent vitality of rural communes in India. According to Kovalevsky, this\nis explained by the fact that the ‘characteristic of Indians consists of the\nsolidity of their communal bond’ (Harstick 1977: 37–8). Although systematic\nextermination and robbery weakened the rural communes in many places, he\nmaintained that ‘they did not completely disappear’. In the notebook, Marx\nhighlighted the ‘survival of the rural communes on a large scale’.17\n\nKovalevsky distinguished ‘natural causes’ and ‘human causes’ in the process of\ntheir dissolution. If these communes would have declined anyway in the long\nrun, communal property can be regarded as a historically transitory form, but\nKovalevsky paid special attention to the human causes of their decline under\nBritish colonial rule. Marx summarized in his own words the negative impact\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 191\n\nof British colonialism upon communes in India, criticizing Kovalevsky’s\nteacher Henry Maine because he marginalized the active role of English\ncolonialism during the dissolution of Indian rural communes: The English\nIndian officials, and the publicists supported upon these, as _Sir H. Maine,\netc_., describe the decline of common property in the Punjab as the mere\nresult, – in spite of the loving English treatment of the archaic form, – of\neconomic progress, whereas they themselves are the _chief bearers_ (active) of\nthe same – to their own danger (p. 184).\n\n(Krader 1975: 394)\n\nIn this passage, Marx modified his original expression to make an even more\nemphatic criticism of Maine’s defence of the dissolution of rural communes in\nIndia than did Kovalevsky (Wada 1975: 145). Their dissolution was not\ninevitable in the course of ‘natural’ development, and Marx was interested in\nthe possibility of active resistance by Indian communes when they collided\nwith the British invasion, creating a ‘danger’ for British rule in India. He\nwould later repeat this point in his letter to Zasulich too in relation to\nRussia.\n\nReading various books on non-capitalist societies, Marx reflected upon the\nflaws in his earlier homogenizing approach and paid attention to\nparticularities and differences among non-Western societies and their\nhistorical changes instead of simply subsuming them under the single European\ncategory of a\n\n‘feudal’ or ‘Asiatic’ mode of production. This is visible from the fact that\nhe explicitly criticized those European historians who imposed a Eurocentric\nconception of history as if its categories were universally applicable to non-\nEuropean regions. For example, Marx called John Phear a ‘donkey’\n\n( _Esel_) in characterizing ‘the constitution of the villages’ in India as\n‘feudal’\n\n(Krader 1974: 256).18 Marx’s comment here differs radically from his earlier\nstatements made in the ‘British Rule in India’ where he had applied the\nOrientalist framework to India’s static and passive society and was happy to\nlet it dissolve in the name of economic progress.19 He no longer praised the\nsuperiority of European societies or justified their colonial intervention in\nAsia in the name of historical progress. Kolja Lindner (2010: 34) thus\nconcludes that ‘Marx breaks with Eurocentric conception of development’ in\n_The Ethnological Notebooks_. Kevin Anderson (2010: 237) similarly argues that\nthe late Marx had ‘created a multilinear and non-reductionist theory of\nhistory, to have analyzed the complexities and differences of non-Western\nsocieties, and to have refused to bind himself into a single model of\ndevelopment or revolution’. Although Marx did not elaborate on this topic in\ndetail in his published writings, one can still discern the process by which\nhe was\n\n‘provincializing Europe’ (Chakrabarty 2010).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n192 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ If Marx really reduced the entire world to\nthe universal law of capitalist development due to his economic determinism\nand historicism, it would be incomprehensible why Marx had to spend so much\ntime conducting research on non-Western and pre-capitalist societies. Rather,\nhe explicitly acknowledged that the existence of the universal law of\ncapitalism does not negate particularities and contingencies and refused to\nsubsume them within a historico-philosophical theory of general development:\n‘By studying each of these evolutions on its own, and then comparing them, one\nwill easily discover the key to the phenomenon, but it will never be arrived\nat by employing the all-purpose formula of a general historico-philosophical\ntheory whose supreme virtue consists in being supra-historical’ ( _MECW_ 24:\n201). The real world is full of contingencies and particularities, and they\ncannot necessarily be analysed adequately using European categories. However,\nMarx’s point is that universal economic categories such as ‘commodity’,\n‘money’ and ‘capital’\n\nobjectively exist in any capitalist society regardless of our consciousness\nand of the historical particularities of each region. These ‘economic forms’\nare universal as long as the capitalist mode of production exists, no matter\nwhere you are and what cultural and geographical background you have. Marx’s\nmethodological dualism is discernible here too in his abstraction of ‘economic\nforms’ from the concrete material reality of the world. Without such a\nuniversal theoretical framework, scientific investigation falls into a\nrelativist and empiricist understanding of reality that consists of isolated\nparticular facts and lacks the ability to reveal the historical dynamics of\nthe capitalist development.\n\nOf course, Marx’s investigation did not stop there. He also analysed how these\neconomic forms are intertwined with particular realities through the mediation\nof labour. This analysis inevitably requires paying careful attention to the\ndifferences and specificities of each society with various contingencies and\ndiscontinuities. Marx thus attempted to carefully study each society in order\nto discern how the contradictions between the universal law of capitalist\ndevelopment and its particular constellation creates not only degradation of\nthe conditions of sustainable human metabolic interaction with nature but also\na possible rupture with the capitalist system in the course of its global\nexpansion. This kind of analysis is, however, only possible _after_ the\ngeneral social dynamics of capitalist development are correctly grasped, and\nit actually lies outside of the proper task of his critique of political\neconomy. Although this analysis lies outside the scope of _Capital_ , it does\nnot mean that this issue is of secondary importance for Marx.\n\nAfter his intensive engagement with Kovalevsky, in 1881 Marx was suddenly and\nunexpectedly compelled to come back to the issue of historical materialism\nupon receiving a request from the Russian revolutionary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 193\n\nVera Zasulich. Intrigued by the polemics in Russia, Zasulich in her letter\ndated 16 February 1881 asked Marx directly about his real intention, so that\nshe could publish his opinion in Russia:\n\nYou would be doing us a very great favour if you were to set forth Your ideas\non the possible fate of our rural commune, and on the theory that it is\nhistorically necessary for every country in the world to pass through all the\nphases of capitalist production. (Shanin 1983: 99) It is in the letter and its\ndrafts that one can discern how Marx’s view changed in the 14 years since the\npublication of volume I of _Capital._ Marx’s rejection of a Eurocentric view\nof history is clearly visible and his new vision of postcapitalist society\nbegins to emerge.\n\nThe actual reply sent to Zasulich is quite short. This is partly because Marx\nwas supporting the populist group People’s Will in Russia, who were in\nopposition to Zasulich’s Black Repartition. Marx knew that sending a letter to\nZasulich would not profit People’s Will. He simply repeated the same point he\nhad made in his letter to _Otechestvenniye Zapiski_ that the ‘historical\ninevitability’ of the law of capitalist development in _Capital_ is expressly\nlimited to the countries of Western Europe’ (Shanin 1983: 100). Nevertheless,\nhe actually wrote three drafts to answer Zasulich’s question. This indicates\nthat the question Zasulich posed was quite striking to him. This is not\nsurprising because her question, coming from Eastern Europe, hit the\nproblematic point in volume I of _Capital_. Zasulich asked whether such a\nEurocentric view of history was really Marx’s own. He thus used this\nopportunity to formulate his ideas based on what he had acquired through his\nintensive engagement with Russian and other non-capitalist countries.\n\nIn the Second Draft,20 Marx quoted from the French edition and repeated the\nsame point he had made in his draft letter to Mikhalovsky:\n\n‘[o]nly in England has it (the expropriation of the agricultural producer)\nbeen accomplished in a radical manner…. All the other countries of Western\nEurope are following the same course’ (loc. cit.). Thus [in writing these\nlines] I expressly restricted [the development in question]\n\nthis ‘historical inevitability’ to ‘the countries of Western Europe’.\n\n(Shanin 1983: 100)\n\nIn this draft, however, he did not refer to the possibility of a Russian\nrevolution.\n\nInstead, he concluded: ‘What threatens the life of the Russian commune is\nneither a historical inevitability nor a theory; it is state oppression, and\nexploitation by capitalist intruders whom the state has made powerful at the\npeasants’ expense’ (Shanin 1983: 104–5). However, the shift in his view of\nRussian society is obvious when he pointed to ‘the economic _superiority_ of\ncommunal property’ (Shanin 1983: 104; emphasis added). This is because\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n194 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ communal property functions as the basis of\nco-operative and associated labour, which was, however, being rapidly\ndestroyed by the capitalist intrusion into Russia.\n\nIn the First Draft Marx again made the same point that Russia has ‘an element\nof superiority over countries still enslaved by the capitalist regime’\n\n(Shanin 1983: 106). Compared to the Second Draft, what is striking is his more\ndetailed discussion of the Russian agrarian communes as ‘an archaic form’.21\nMarx cautioned that the term ‘archaic’ ought not have a negative connotation,\nstating that one ‘should not, then, be too frightened by the word “archaic”’\n(Shanin 1983: 107). Referring to Georg L. Maurer, Marx also distinguished\nbetween ‘archaic commune’ and ‘commune of the secondary formation’ among the\nGermanic tribes. He argued that one of the key differences between these two\ntypes of communes was that while archaic communes carry out collective\nproduction and distributes its products directly among members, the newer\n(secondary) commune maintained collective property of land but allocated and\ndistributed it among members, so that its members individually appropriated\ntheir fruits. Due to this ‘dualism’ of collectivism and individualism, the\n‘commune of the secondary formation’ is at risk of decay, but the dissolution\nof an excessively strong communal bond also created the possibility of ‘a\ndevelopment of individuality’ (Shanin 1983: 109). According to Marx, it\ndepends on each ‘historical context’ whether individualism will overwhelm\ncollectivism and lead to the disintegration of communes, or collective\nregulation will remain in the process of socialization of labour, opening up a\nsocialist path.\n\nIn Marx’s opinion, the historical context was favourable for the Russian\nagricultural communes: ‘Russia is the only European country in which the\n\n“agricultural commune” has maintained itself on a national scale up to the\npresent day’ (Shanin 1983: 110). Acknowledging that the ‘commune perished in\nthe midst of never-ending foreign and intestine warfare’ in Western Europe\n(Shanin 1983: 107), he pointed out that the historical circumstances\nsurrounding Russian communes in the late 19th century were quite different and\nunique. Unlike in India, they existed together with Western capitalism without\nbeing subjugated to its colonial rule. Furthermore, although the isolation of\nthe communes as a ‘localised microcosm’ was a source of weakness, the positive\nfruits of the capitalist development of technologies and means of\ncommunication and transportation in the West could help overcome such\nisolation and enable collective labour. Marx thus maintained that there was no\nneed to let Russia’s remaining rural communes and their communal properties\nperish under the tidal waves of capitalist modernization and globalization\nthat would then engulf the entire planet. The vitality of the rural communes\nin Russia could provide a basis for resistance against ruthless and limitless\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 195\n\ncapitalist expansion. Marx affirmed Russia’s potential for a communist\ntransition without going through the historical stage of capitalism: ‘The\n_contemporaneity_ of Western [capitalist] production, which dominates the\nworld market, enables Russia to build into the commune all the positive\nachievements of the capitalist system, without having to pass under its harsh\ntribute’ (Shanin 1983: 110).\n\nMarx did not demand the preservation of the pre-capitalist condition of the\nrural commune as it was but rather advocated for the development of the\ncommunes ‘on their present foundations’ by actively absorbing the positive\noutcomes of Western capitalism. Only then could they utilize this encounter\nwith the West as a chance to establish communism in Russia. However, the\nremaining time was limited as the decay of the _mir_ was already happening.\n\nMarx thus argued for an immediate Russian revolution: ‘If the revolution takes\nplace in time, if it concentrates all its forces to ensure the unfettered rise\nof the rural commune, the latter will soon develop as a regenerating element\nof Russian society and an element of superiority over the countries enslaved\nby the capitalist regime’ (Shanin 1983: 116–17).\n\nMarx’s view of history changed by 1881 in that he explicitly acknowledged the\npower of Russian rural communes to make their own history by leaping to\nsocialism based on existing communal property without going through the\ndestructive process of capitalist modernization. Marx discovered the\npossibility of a Russian Revolution by focusing on the active elements of\nresistance to capitalist expansion in non-Western societies. His conclusion in\nthe unsent letter was not an arbitrary one. In fact, Marx together with Engels\nexpressed the same view in the preface to the second Russian edition of _The_\n_Communist_ _Manifesto_ :\n\nCan the Russian _obshchina_ , a form, albeit heavily eroded, of the primeval\ncommunal ownership of the land, pass directly into the higher, communist form\nof communal ownership? Or must it first go through the same process of\ndissolution that marks the West’s historical development? Today there is only\none possible answer: If the Russian revolution becomes the signal for a\nproletarian revolution in the West, so that the two complement each other,\nthen Russia’s peasant communal landownership may serve as the point of\ndeparture for a communist development. (Shanin 1983: 139)\n\nThis statement is not mere lip service to their Russian readers. On the\ncontrary, without this explicit clarification in the new preface, the\npublication of _The_ _Communist Manifesto_ in Russian would make people wonder\neven more whether Marx naively held a Eurocentric view of history. Thus, Marx\nand Engels cautioned that the Russian communes could not only avoid going\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n196 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ through the capitalist stage but even\ndemanded that they _initiate_ communist development by sending ‘the signal for\na proletarian revolution in the West’.\n\nThey recognized the active agency of Russian society as the driving motor of\nhistory.22\n\nThere is no need to limit this argument to Russia. The same logic can be\napplied to other agrarian communes existing in those areas that Marx\nintensively studied at that time in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Marx\nviewed Asian communes as agricultural rural communes of the most recent type\nthat survived destruction through war and invasion (Shanin 1983: 108).23\nUnlike the 1850s when he still praised the ‘double mission’, Marx in the Third\nDraft much more explicitly denounced British ‘vandalism’ in India (Shanin\n1983: 118) and its destruction of indigenous agriculture: ‘The English\nthemselves made such attempts in the East Indies; they only managed to spoil\nindigenous agriculture and to swell the number and intensity of famines’\n(Shanin 1983: 121). This has to do with his recognition with the ‘element of\nsuperiority’\n\nthat was being destroyed under colonial rule. Various archaic communes that\nremained all over the world had the same potential power, though of course to\ndifferent degrees. Marx came to advocate that they could and should _actively_\nresist capitalism and that they possessed collective _agency_ to establish\nsocialism as a new stage of human history. In other words, they were no longer\na passive object of history without their own agency to resist capitalism and\ncreate a new society. Given this transformation in the thought of the late\nMarx, Said was not justified in denouncing Marx as a typical ‘Orientalist’.\n\n\n## **iv**\n\n### **the traNsforMatioN of Marx’s visioN**\n\n\n## **of coMMuNisM**\n\nHowever, this is not the end of the story. The last section details what can\nbe regarded as today’s shared understanding of the late Marx, at least among\nMarxian scholars, thanks to Haruki Wada (1975), Kevin Anderson (2010), and\nKolja Lindner (2010). Nevertheless, some scholars reject these attempts at\nreinterpreting the late Marx’s thought to demonstrate his theoretical\nrelevancy to contemporary capitalism. In his recent biography, published on\nthe bicentenary of Marx’s birth, the British historian Gareth Stedman Jones\n(2016: 569), like Anderson and Lindner, points to a ‘remarkable change’ in the\nlate Marx. His overall evaluation of this shift is, however, a negative one,\nconfining the validity of Marx’s argument to the 19th century.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 197\n\nStedman Jones is worth referring to in the current analysis because he is one\nof the few who pay attention to the key year of 1868, when Marx encountered\nthe work of Georg Ludwig von Maurer. However, Stedman Jones is dismissive of\nboth Maurer and of Marx’s reception of his work. His intention in discussing\nMaurer’s work becomes apparent in the concluding part of his biography, which\nrefers to Fustel de Coulanges’s refutation of Maurer in his _Origin of\nProperty in Land_ (1889). In Stedman Jones’s opinion, Coulanges successfully\nrepudiated Maurer’s romantic and nationalistic idealization of the Teutonic\ntribes, but even before that, it was almost ‘outmoded by the time of Marx’s\ndeath’, Stedman Jones argues, because it was not based on empirical research\nbut mainly on ‘classical or biblical’ speculation – Maurer’s work is based on\nCaesar’s _Gallic Wars_ and Tacitus’s _Germania_ – that conflates historical\nfact and fiction (Jones 2016: 592).24 Marx’s attraction to Maurer and to Henry\nL. Morgan implies that Marx’s youthful ‘romanticism’, which according to Jones\nwas stronger when the young Marx dreamt of becoming a poet, underwent a\nrevival as the tide of revolution receded in the West in the 1870s, especially\nafter the bloody defeat of the Paris Commune. He concludes that Marx’s\n‘romantic’ conclusions are not acceptable today because his interest in the\nagricultural rural communes reflects ‘a nineteenth-century phantasm’\n\n(Jones 2016: 568). In short, Marx’s analysis of non-Western and pre-capitalist\nsocieties is nothing but a nostalgic and Orientalist fiction that fetishizes\nthe Other.\n\nA question arises here. Is it just the nostalgic ‘romanticism’ of an older\nperson to search for revolutionary possibilities in non-Western society? This\nkind of criticism is nothing new. As seen earlier, many scholars have argued\nthat the old Marx lost his intellectual capacity and revolutionary hope in the\nWest due to his severe illness: ‘But there is little to show for the last\ndecade of his life.\n\nIt is a period of decline and of increasing ill-health and incapacity’ (Carr\n1934: 279). This is why Eric Hobsbawm (2011: 162–3) felt compelled to\nhighlight the danger of such a reactionary characterization of the late Marx:\n‘The view that the older Marx lost some of the revolutionary ardour of the\nyounger, is always popular among critics who wish to abandon the revolutionary\npractice of Marxism while retaining a fondness for his theory.’ Confining Marx\nto the theory and history of the 19th century without any practical\nimplication for today’s world is a safe way to treat him within academic\ndiscourse.\n\nStedman Jones’s claim about Marx’s retreat to romanticism only makes sense if\nthe late Marx did erroneously idealize the Russian commune. This is clearly\nnot the case. First, his study of Russian society was based upon various\nstudies _by Russians_ that contain more empirical analysis than Maurer’s, and\nhe was aware that these communes, often accompanied by poverty and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n198 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ unfreedom, were rapidly decaying in the face\nof capitalist intrusion.25 Second, when the real contradictions become more\nmanifest in the peripheries of capitalism, there is nothing wrong with\nresearching the possibility of a social revolution in Russia seriously, paying\nattention to its specificities. Finally, even before weakening of a\nrevolutionary hope in Western societies after the collapse of the Paris\nCommune, Marx in 1868 emphasized that the revolution in England could only\noccur when the Irish people were liberated. Since he clearly emphasized at\nthat time that revolutionary movements in the capitalist centre alone are not\nsufficient to overthrow capitalism, his engagement with non-Western societies\nin the 1870s and 1880s cannot simply be explained by his disappointment at the\nharsh reality in Western Europe and by his illness.\n\nHowever, it is not adequate to respond to Stedman Jones’s criticism by arguing\nthat Marx shifted from a unilateral view to a multilinear view of history, as\nKevin Anderson (2010) does. Stedman Jones does not necessarily deny this\npoint. Rather, he dismisses this move as a form of romanticism. In addition,\nthe claim that the late Marx significantly changed his attitude towards the\npossibility of Russian revolution is also not very new, as Haruki Wada (1975)\nand Teodor Shanin (1983) already pointed it out several decades ago.\nFurthermore, Marx had already studied various non-Western societies in the\nlate 1850s and subsequently strengthened his anti-colonial and abolitionist\nposition (Ghosh 1984). Considering these facts, Anderson underestimates Marx’s\nintellectual ability in concluding that his final theoretical standpoint after\nmore than 20 years is the acquisition of a non-Eurocentric and multilateral\nview of history. Unfortunately, this underestimation is one reason why Stedman\nJones’s critique appears compelling because it strengthens the impression that\nMarx did not achieve much after 1868. In order to refute Stedman Jones, one\nneeds to demonstrate the late Marx’s theoretical relevance to today’s world.\nFor that purpose, it does not suffice to show that Marx abandoned his earlier\nunilinear view of history because hardly anyone adopts such a reductionistic\nview today.\n\nIn a word, it is necessary to show that the new theoretical scope indicated in\nhis letter to Zasulich is larger than both Stedman Jones and Anderson assume.\n\nIn fact, once this new scope is properly grasped, Stedman Jones’s critique of\nMarx’s romanticism appears trivial because the price he had to pay for his\ninterpretation is higher: by dismissing the revolutionary character of the\nlate Marx’s theoretical engagement after 1868 altogether, Stedman Jones fails\nto recognize Marx’s final vision of post-capitalism.\n\nFurthermore, even if Anderson determinedly rejects the old dogma of Marxism,\nit is undeniable that his entire polemics pivot around a Eurocentric/\n\nlinear vs postcolonial/multilinear view of history. In a sense, they are still\nconfined by the very traditional paradigm of historical materialism. That\nnarrows the scope of the discussion. To put it bluntly, Marx’s primary\ninterest https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 199\n\nwas _not_ to establish the law of history. In other words, Marx’s main\ntheoretical task in engagement with pre-capitalist and non-Western societies\nwas _not_ to test the applicability of his law. The idea of historical\nmaterialism as an\n\n‘iron law’ was strengthened by later Marxists after his death. By abandoning\nthe paradigm of historical materialism today, one can reinvestigate what was\nreally at stake for Marx’s project in the 1880s. This requires to challenge\nboth Eurocentrism _and_ productivism.\n\nIf the conclusion of Anderson’s path-breaking investigation of Marx’s\nnotebooks appears somewhat predictable, and if Stedman Jones’s response ends\nup repeating the stereotypical criticism of Marx, it is because they only deal\nwith _one_ aspect of Marx’s historical materialism, that is ‘Eurocentrism’,\nneglecting the other, that is ‘productivism’.26 The need remains for a more\nintegral approach.\n\nThis is a decisive point. Only by looking at the problems of _both_\nEurocentrism and productivism does a completely new interpretation of the late\nMarx become compelling. That is, not that the paths to communism became plural\nbut that _Marx’s idea of communism itself_ significantly changed in the 1880s\nas a result of his conscious reflection upon earlier theoretical flaws and the\none-sidedness of historical materialism. The transcendence of capitalism and\nthe establishment of communism was apparently the main theoretical and\npractical task throughout Marx’s life, but this problem has never been\ndiscussed in the previous literature in relation to his letter to Zasulich.\nActually, Marx in 1881 utilized this opportunity to formulate his vision of\nnon-class society based on what he had learned through his intensive study of\nrural communes.27\n\nThe possibility that Marx’s idea of communism transformed in his late years is\nhinted at by the substantial delay in publishing volumes II and III of\n_Capital_. Even though Engels strongly desired their completion as soon as\npossible, Marx conducted his research in natural science and pre-capitalist\nsocieties. The riddle remained for a long time why Marx spent so much time on\nthese topics instead of finishing _Capital_. Indeed, it looks as if Marx,\nunder pressure and with worsening health, wanted to escape from the painful\njob of writing _Capital_. For example, Ludo Cuyvers (2020: 33) commented on\nMarx’s\n\n‘erratic’ interest rather negatively: ‘Marx’s perfectionism, combined with a\nwide and seemingly erratic interest in knowledge – which also explains his\nstudies in the 1870s of Russian, mathematics, geology, ethnography, etc. –\n\nmost likely contributed much to _Capital_ being left unfinished.’ However,\nsuch an explanation is not compelling as long as Cuyvers does not investigate\nthe actual content of these notebooks. In contrast, I argue that Marx did not\ncompletely lose his intellectual capacities and passion despite his serious\nhealth condition, and he strove to learn new things _in order to complete_\n_Capital_.28\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n200 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ The hint for solving this riddle is Marx’s\ntheory of metabolism as the central pillar of his political economy. In other\nwords, his intensive engagement with ecology and pre-capitalist/non-Western\nsocieties was indispensable in order to deepen his theory of metabolism. Marx\nattempted to comprehend the different ways of organizing metabolism between\nhumans and nature in non-Western and pre-capitalist rural communes as the\nsource of their vitality.\n\nFrom the perspective of Marx’s theory of metabolism, it is not sufficient to\ndeal with his research in non-Western and pre-capitalist societies in terms of\ncommunal property, agriculture and labour. One should note that agriculture\nwas the main field of Marx’s ecological theory of metabolic rift. In other\nwords, what is at stake in his research on non-Western societies is not merely\nthe dissolution of communal property through colonial rule. It has ecological\nimplications. In fact, with his growing interest in ecology, Marx came to see\nthe plunder of the natural environment as a manifestation of the central\ncontradiction of capitalism. He consciously reflected on the irrationality of\nthe development of the productive forces of capital, which strengthens the\nrobbery praxis and deepens the metabolic rift on a global scale. Marx also\nstudied radically different ways of social organization of metabolic\ninteraction between humans and nature in precapitalist and non-Western\nsocieties from an ecological perspective.\n\nIt is through the mediation of this concept that these two research fields\nprove to be closely connected to each other. Here one also needs to recall why\nthe late Marx started studying pre-capitalist and non-Western societies: he\nwas prompted to deal with Maurer’s analysis of the Teutonic communes after\nreading Carl Fraas’s ecological work in the beginning of 1868. Fraas’s\ndiscussion on Teutonic ‘mark association’ ( _Markgenossenschaft_) and its\nsustainable agriculture draws upon Maurer’s analysis. In other words, _the_\n_issues of ecology and pre-capitalist societies are connected from the very\nbeginning_.\n\nWhile Marx’s ecological interest certainly existed before reading Fraas, his\nwork expanded its scope, so that Marx not only found a ‘socialist tendency’\n\nin his critique of excessive deforestation but also came to pay more attention\nto the concrete ways of metabolic interaction in pre-capitalist societies from\nan ecological perspective.29 He now recognized that cooperative production and\ncorresponding communal property in those societies are related to more\nsustainable form of human metabolic interaction with their environment. In\nfact, Marx found the same ‘socialist tendency’ in Maurer’s _Einleitung_ ,\nreferring to radical ‘egalitarianism’ in the Teutonic communes: The second\nreaction is to look beyond the Middle Ages into the primitive age of each\nnation, and that corresponds to the socialist tendency, although these learned\nmen have no idea that the two have any connection. They are therefore\nsurprised to find what is newest in https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 201\n\nwhat is oldest – even equalitarians, to a degree which would have made\nProudhon shudder. ( _MECW_ 42: 557)\n\nBy characterizing both Maurer and Fraas with the same ‘socialist tendency’,\nMarx implied a connection between sustainability and social equality. But how\nare they related?\n\nAccording to Maurer, ‘mark association’ is a transitory period from nomadic to\nagricultural life.30 In contrast to Justus Möser, who insisted upon the\nexistence of private property as the basis of the _Mark_ , Maurer emphasized\nthe fundamentally communal character of the Germanic form of property, as Marx\ndocumented in his notebook:\n\nIndividual yards without any cooperative ties ... did not originally exist at\nall.\n\n_Family and tribal cooperatives_ rather already existed before the permanent\nsettlements, _they already settled as such_ , and did not only come into being\nsince their settlement. ( _MEGA_ IV/18: 544; emphasis in original) Teutonic\ntribes treated the land as communal property, so land did not belong to any\nsingle individual. They carefully arranged the regular allocation of the land\nso that its fruits were equally distributed without the concentration of\nwealth in the hands of the few.\n\nOnly that part of the field that could be cultivated was divided, and at first\nonly as much as was needed to feed the members. All other land not capable of\ncultivation or not necessary for cultivation remained in an undivided\ncommunity. This included first of all the _forests, pastures,_ _heaths, moors,\netc_. (p. 84) Also in Gaul and the other conquered provinces only the already\ncultivated and tilled land was subjected to division.\n\nIn contrast, many _fields_ and _forests_ (silva indivisa, silva communis) etc.\n\nremained there in undivided community. p. 87. ( _MEGA_ IV/18: 554; emphasis in\noriginal)\n\nMarx carefully traced passages of Maurer’s _Einleitung_ in which he explained\nnot only that mark associations secured common pasture for grazing but also\nthat they introduced a lottery in the process of allocating land among\nmembers: In all these communities, the mark village with all the gardens,\nfields, meadows, pastures and forests was in the undivided community of the\ncooperative members, as already at the time of Caesar. The individual received\nhis share of the common mark, as far as it was distributed, for a number of\nyears, but only for cultivation and use. The share of each in the gardens,\nfields and meadows was allotted to him and was called the whole share. After\nthe expiration of the years designated for special use, all shares reverted to\nthe community and were then remeasured and again distributed to the\nindividuals. The pastures were used jointly and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n202 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ the community’s needs and taxes were met from\nthe yield of the forests, but what remained was distributed among all the\nmembers in proportion to the lots assigned to them. (6, 7). ( _MEGA_ IV/18:\n545) This was an effective way to prevent the formation of relationships of\ndomination and subjugation among its members due to the concentration of\nwealth. This communal treatment of lands marks a clear contrast to\n_Latifundium_ , the system of large landed property worked with slave labour\nin ancient Rome, although Maurer also traced how under the influence of the\nRoman law this lottery system was gradually replaced by the system of private\nproperty (Maurer 1865: 98).\n\nAt the same time, since land did not belong to anyone, the commune also\nprevented particular individuals from arbitrary usage of land as well as sales\nof its products, guaranteeing the sustainability of social production. Maurer\nwrote about the closed character of _Markgenossenschaft_ in those passages in\n_Geschichte der Dorfverfassung_ to which Fraas referred to in his\n_Ackerbaukrisen_ _und ihre Heilmittel_ :\n\nThe export of wood from the village commons and sale outside the commons was\nforbidden in free communities as well as in manorial communities... For the\nsame reason, houses, barns, warehouses and other buildings were not allowed to\nbe sold from the village commons.... The same prohibition applies to the\nexport of manure or dung, straw, hay and other fodder, then brooms and other\nproducts of the village.... The same also applies to the sale of fish and\ncrabs caught in the village.... In the same way, the fruits and animals raised\nin the village should be consumed as much as possible in the village itself or\nthe products should at least be processed there. Therefore, the pigs fattened\nin the village should not be sold outside it.... For the same reason, the\ncrops and wines grown in the village should also be ground, baked, eaten and\ndrunk in the village itself, which then led to socage rights in many villages.\n(Maurer 1865: 313–16)31\n\nBeing familiar with Justus von Liebig, one immediately realizes that such a\nstrong system of communal regulation over lands guaranteed the circulation of\nsoil nutrients, which realized sustainable agriculture by securing the ‘law of\nreplenishment’. Fraas (1866: 209) thus concluded, based on Maurer’s analysis,\nthat ‘the first Teutonic village formation already always followed the law of\nthe necessity of increasing soil power’ instead of robbery of the soil. In\nthis way, Maurer and Fraas agreed that communal regulation was indeed founded\nupon both sustainability _and_ social equity. These two aspects were closely\nlinked in Marx’s notebook in March 1868. Underlying them was the radically\ndifferent metabolic relation between humans and nature within the Teutonic\ncommune compared to the capitalist mode of production.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 203\n\nMarx’s characterization of Fraas and Maurer with the same ‘socialist tendency’\nindicates the central importance of ‘social equity’ and ‘sustainability’\n\nin his socialist project. This insight is essential to understanding the late\nMarx. Certainly, Marx was well aware that pre-capitalist communes were more\negalitarian than modern society before reading Fraas and Maurer. He\ncharacterized communal primitive societies even as ‘indigenous communism’\n\n( _Capital_ III: 970), but he did not sufficiently take its ecological\ndimension into account and often dismissed its exclusionary and steady\ncharacter. His re-evaluation of ‘indigenous communism’ after 1868 is related\nto his deepening ecological awareness, a tendency that continued until his\nreception of Morgan’s\n\n‘communism in living’ in 1880–1.32\n\nMarx wrote to Engels in the same letter dated on March 1868 about his surprise\nat finding ‘what is newest in what is oldest’ ( _MECW_ 42: 557).\n\nFor Stedman Jones, this simply represents a further manifestation of his\nromanticism. However, this statement was made in March 1868. Why had Marx\nsuddenly become ‘romantic’ only a few months after the publication of volume I\nof _Capital_? He must have been quite passionate about the possibility of a\nsocialist revolution with the publication of his masterpiece. Paying attention\nto the interconnectedness of sustainability and social equality, the story\nlooks quite different. It becomes clear why Marx started to simultaneously\nstudy pre-capitalist societies and natural sciences after 1868. With this in\nmind, one can imagine that Marx must have been surprised again to ‘find what\nis newest in what is oldest’ when he studied Russian agricultural communes in\nthe 1870s. In fact, Marx reread Maurer’s _Einleitung_ together with two other\nbooks by him in 1876.33\n\nIn the Third Draft of his letter to Zasulich, Marx refers to Maurer again when\nhe repeated the same point about the perpetual character of the Germanic\ncommunes that he had made in the letter of March 1868: More importantly,\nhowever, we find the clear imprint of this ‘agrarian commune’ so clearly\ntraced on the new commune which emerged from it that Maurer was able to\nreconstruct the former while working to decipher the latter. The new commune –\nin which cultivable land is privately owned by the producers, while the\nforests, pastures, waste ground, etc., still remain communal property – was\nintroduced by the Germans to all the countries they conquered. Thanks to\ncertain features borrowed from its prototype, it became the only focus of\npopular life and liberty throughout the Middle Ages. (Shanin 1983: 118–19) The\n‘ _natural vitality_ ’ (Shanin 1983: 118) of the agrarian communes was so\nstrong that while other communes collapsed and disappeared due to war and\ninvasion, these agrarian communes survived for a long time as the ‘new\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n204 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ commune’ in Germany at Marx’s time.34 In\nRussia, the ‘agrarian commune’\n\nexisted more solidly, so it could be utilized as the foundation for a\nsocialist revolution.\n\nHowever, one should note that this is only one part of the story. Marx was\ninterested in how non-Western viability could be utilized in Western Europe\nfor the purpose of leaping to a post-capitalist society. It is not an\nexaggeration to say that the main purpose of his long engagement with the\nrural communes and natural sciences is not the revolutionary potentiality of\nthose non-Western communes but rather _their meaning for Western Europe_.\nSince Zasulich suddenly asked him, he was compelled to ‘descend from pure\ntheory to Russian reality’\n\n(Shanin 1983: 112), writing directly about the path of the Russian Revolution\nin his letter. Yet Marx was originally studying pre-capitalist and non-Western\nsocieties because their ‘natural vitality’ was inspiring even for the sake of\nenvisioning a post-capitalist society in Western Europe. This might sound\ncontradictory, but in order to comprehend this point, one needs to analyse\nMarx’s letter to Zasulich from an ecological perspective.\n\nAs discussed earlier, Marx was forced to critically reconsider his earlier\ntheoretical scheme in the 1860s due to the ecological degradation brought\nabout by capitalist development. Metabolic rift is nothing but a manifestation\nof the degradation of ‘natural vitality’ through the capitalist destruction of\ncommunal production and property. In this sense, class formation and\nenvironmental degradation have the same root cause. This made Marx doubt\nwhether Western Europe, with its ‘higher’ productive forces, was in fact\nsuperior to non-Western and pre-capitalist societies. His use of the\nexpression ‘economic superiority’ in the letter in relation to pre-capitalist\ncommunes, confirms this doubt. For example, even though the productive forces\nof mark association are much lower than Western capitalist societies, they are\n‘superior’ in that they had a much more conscious regulation of their\nmetabolic interaction with nature, simultaneously securing social equality and\nsoil fertility. This was the source of their long-lasting natural vitality.\nSince productive forces of capital do not provide the foundation for a post-\ncapitalist society, Marx was prompted to argue that Western societies need to\nlearn different ways of organizing metabolism from these agrarian communes.\nThis attitude marks an absolute departure from his earlier Eurocentrism.\n\nThrough this learning process, Marx’s analysis of Western capitalism and his\nvision of post-capitalist society changed significantly over time. One can\ndetect a hint of this theoretical modification in his letter to Zasulich, when\nMarx pointed to the ‘crisis’ of capitalism in Western Europe: Today,\n[capitalism] faces a social system which, both in Western Europe and the\nUnited States, is in conflict with science, with the popular masses,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 205\n\nand with the very productive forces that it generates – in short, in a crisis.\n\n(Shanin 1983: 106)\n\nIt is noteworthy that Marx discussed the crisis of capitalism not just in\nrelation to working-class movements but also to ‘science’ and ‘productive\nforces’. Marxism–Leninism almost naturally read the meaning of this crisis in\na productivist fashion to mean that the further development of science and\ntechnology would ultimately blow capitalism sky high and terminate the crisis\nof capitalism. However, when considering Marx’s ecology in _Capital_ , such a\nproductivist reading of the passage is no longer compelling.\n\nIf one reads this passage in the letter from the perspective of Marx as a\n_critic_ of productivism, its meaning becomes the opposite one. Capitalism\nfinds itself in the middle of perpetual crises because it is exposed to harsh\ncriticisms from ‘science’ that capitalism has become an obstacle to the\nsustainable development of productive forces. For example, Liebig and Fraas\nmaintained that, under capitalism, new technologies would only reinforce\nrobbery of nature. Its unsustainable character is far from the ‘rational’\napplication of modern science in Liebig’s and Fraas’s sense. These ecological\nscientists questioned the legitimacy of capitalism as a progressive social\nsystem. In other words, they unveiled the failure of the modern Promethean\nproject to subjugate and manipulate nature. In contrast, when natural science\nis brought into the service of such a capitalist purpose, it inevitably turns\nout to be ‘exploitative’\n\nand ‘wasteful’.\n\nAs Marx argued in volume III of _Capital_ , the earth is a common property,\nand this irrational treatment of the earth is unacceptable: ‘The entire spirit\nof capitalist production, which is oriented towards the most immediate\nmonetary profit – stands in contradiction to agriculture, which has to concern\nitself with the whole gamut of permanent conditions of life required by the\nchain of human generations’ ( _Capital_ III: 754). The capitalist system of\nprivate property, including the private ownership of land, legitimizes the\narbitrary usage of what belongs to private individuals. Furthermore, the\ndamage caused by the selfish misbehaviour of atomized individuals would spill\nover to the whole society in a disproportionate manner. By contrast, Marx\ndemanded that ‘the associated producers, govern the human metabolism with\nnature in a rational way’ ( _Capital_ III: 959). This is also exactly what\nLiebig and Fraas demanded, which amplified the crisis of capitalism.\n\nHow does this crisis end? Marx continued to argue in the First Draft that the\ncrisis of capitalism ‘will end through its own elimination, _through the\nreturn_ _of modern societies to a higher form of an “archaic” type of\ncollective ownership and_ _production_ ’ (Shanin 1983: 107; emphasis added).\nHere again, ‘what is newest is what is the oldest’. Marx did not argue that\ncommunism would be established https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n206 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ after pushing capitalist development as far\nas possible. Surprisingly, he now claimed that Western Europe needed to\n‘return’ to pre-capitalist society. Is this romanticism? The real question\nbecomes what exactly Western Europe needs to integrate from non-Western\nsocieties so that they can ‘return’ to a higher form of an archaic type.\n\nWe are finally approaching the theoretical core of the late Marx. As seen\nearlier, after Marx speculated about the interrelation of ‘sustainability’ and\n\n‘social equality’ in the 1870s, he took Zasulich’s question as an opportunity\nto formulate a new form of rational regulation of human metabolism with nature\nin Western Europe and the United State. In doing so, he amended his\npresupposition about the superiority of Western societies for ecological\nreasons. Now he insisted that Western societies revive the superior elements\nof archaic communes in the process of establishing communism. In other words,\nwhat is important is not the pluralization of the historical course and the\nprovincialization of Europe but that Marx significantly modified his vision of\ncommunism as such.\n\nThe expression of returning to a ‘higher form’ is influenced by Henry L.\nMorgan’s _Ancient Society_.35 Morgan argued that the main aim of modern\nWestern society has become a ‘mere property career’. He also argued for\nreturning to the democratic communal life at a higher scale in order to\nrehabilitate liberty, equality and fraternity in ‘a higher form’. Marx noted\nthe following passage:\n\nThe time will come, nevertheless, _when_ human intelligence _will rise to_\n_the mastery over property_.... A _mere property career is not the final\ndestiny_ of mankind. The _time which has passed away since civilisation_ began\nis but a fragment (and very small) of the past duration of man’s existence;\nand _but_ _a fragment of the ages yet to come_. _The dissolution of society\nbids fair to become_ _the termination of a career of which property is the end\nand aim; because such a_ _career contains the elements of self-\ndestruction...._ It (a higher plan of society) _will be a revival, in a higher\nform, of the liberty, equality and fraternity of the_ _ancient gentes_.\n(Krader 1974: 139; emphasis in original) Although Morgan did not elaborate in\ndetail what this higher form of society should look like, he repeatedly used\nthe term ‘communism in living’ in opposition to a capitalist society,\nespecially focusing on the sindiasmic family of the Iroquois.36 It is\nnoteworthy that Marx was adding comments in brackets on their similarity with\nRussian rural communes: _Communism in living_ seems to have originated _in the\nnecessities of_ _the consanguine family_ , to have been continued in the\npunaluan, and transmitted to the _syndyasmian_ under the American aborigenes,\nwith whom it remained a practice down to the epoch of their discovery –\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 207\n\n(and the _South Slavonians_? and even _Russians_ to a certain degree?) (Krader\n1974: 115; emphasis in original)\n\nMarx repeated the same point by inserting comments in brackets again,\nindicating that he was influenced by Haxthausen’s analysis of the abolition of\nserfdom in Russia in 1861:\n\n_forming a communal household [like South Slavonians and. in some degree:_\n_Russian peasants_ before and after serf emancipation] in which the\n_principle_ _of communism in living was practised_. This fact proves _that_\n_the family was_ _too feeble an organisation_ to face alone the hardships of\nlife. (Krader 1974: 116; emphasis in original)\n\nCompelled by the hardship of the natural environment, Russians had to rely on\nmutual aid instead of Darwinian natural selection based on _bellum omnium_\n_contra omnes_ , a view that Peter Kropotkin put forward later.\n\nThrough the communal regulation of lands and property, communism in living\nbasically repeated the same cycle of production every year. That is, its long-\nlasting traditional way of production realized a _stationary and circular_\n_economy without economic growth_ , which Marx once dismissed as the\nregressive steadiness of primitive societies without history. This principle\nof steady-state economy in agrarian communes is radically different from\ncapitalism that pursues endless capital accumulation and economic growth. Marx\nwas aware of this point as he noted Caesar’s description of the Teutonic\ncommunes in Morgan’s _Ancient Society_ :\n\nFor agriculture they have no zeal, and the greater part of their food consists\nof milk, cheese, and flesh. No man has a definite quantity of land or estate\nof his own: the magistrates and chiefs every year assign to tribes and clans\nthat have assembled together as much land and in such place as seems good to\nthem, and compel the tenants after a year to pass on elsewhere. They adduce\nmany reasons for that practice – the fear that they may be tempted by\ncontinuous association to substitute agriculture for their warrior zeal; that\nthey may become zealous for the acquisition of broad territories, and so the\nmore powerful may drive the lower sort from their holdings; that they may\nbuild with greater care to avoid the extremes of cold and heat; that some\npassion for money may arise to be the parent of parties and of quarrels. It is\ntheir aim to keep common people in contentment, when each man sees that his\nown wealth is equal to that of the most powerful.37 (Krader 1974: 413)\nCommunal regulation and restriction were necessary for people to reproduce\nthemselves, and the development of productive forces was quite slow as\ntechnologies remained ‘persistent’, as Marx noted: ‘The arts by which savages\nmaintain their lives are remarkably persistent’ (Krader 1974: 143).\nNevertheless, https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n208 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ the low and stationary level of productive\nforces was not because they were\n\n‘barbaric’ and ‘ignorant’ of science. Even if they had possibilities of\nincreasing productive forces or working for longer hours, these communities\n_intentionally_ avoided doing so. In this way, they consciously prevented the\nconcentration of power which generates the relationship of domination and\nsubjugation (Clastres 1989).\n\nMarx’s call for returning to the archaic type in the letter to Zasulich is not\na careless and arbitrary one. By the 1880s Marx recognized that the persistent\nstability of communes without economic growth is the underlying foundation for\nrealizing sustainable and egalitarian metabolic interaction between humans and\nnature. This marks a clear contrast to Marx’s previous negative comments on\nthe stationary state and invariability of the Asian communes in the 1850s and\neven in volume I of _Capital_. This is how these two seemingly irrelevant\nresearch fields of natural science and communes prove tightly interwoven in\nMarx’s abandonment of his earlier historical materialism. After 14 years of\nresearch, he concluded that sustainability and equality based on a steady-\nstate economy is the source of power to resist capitalism, and it would be no\nwonder should Russian communes skip the capitalist stage to arrive at\ncommunism. It is also this kind of sustainability and equality of the steady-\nstate economy that Western societies consciously need to ‘return’ as a higher\nform of the archaic type as a solution to the crisis of capitalism. In short,\nMarx’s last vision of postcapitalism is _degrowth communism_.\n\nMarx’s call for a ‘return’ to non-capitalist society demands that any serious\nattempt at overcoming capitalism in Western society needs to learn from non-\nWestern societies and integrate the new principle of a steady-state economy.\nMarx’s rejection of productivism is _not_ identical with the romantic\nadvocation of a ‘return to the countryside’. In fact, he repeatedly added that\nthe Russian communes would have to assimilate the positive fruits of\ncapitalist development. The critique of productive forces of capital is not\nequivalent to a rejection of all technologies. Western Europe must not abandon\nall of its own previous development, and it is the combination of the fruits\nof capitalist development and the principle of steady-state economy in non-\nWestern societies that would allow Western societies to leap communism as a\nhigher stage of the archaic communes. This revival of communism in living as\ndegrowth communism is utterly different from the productivist approach of\ntraditional Marxism in the 20th century, but it is consistent with Marx’s\nrecognition that the further development of ‘productive forces of capital’\ndoes not lead to the establishment of a post-capitalist society.\n\nThe idea of degrowth communism is opposite to the young Marx’s Prometheanism\nand nor is it quite identical with the standpoint of\n\n‘ecosocialism’ that he put forward in _Capital_ through his reception of\nLiebig’s https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 209\n\ncritique of robbery agriculture. Ecosocialism does not exclude the possibility\nof pursuing further sustainable economic growth once _capitalist_ production\nis overcome, but degrowth communism maintains that growth is not sustainable\nnor desirable even in socialism. Accordingly, degrowth communism is also\ndifferent from Engels’s vision of post-capitalism. Engels believed that once\ncapitalism was transcended, ecosocialism would fully emancipate productive\nforces for the sake of the working class: socialism realizes ‘constantly\naccelerated development of the productive forces, and … a practically\n_unlimited increase_ of production itself ’ ( _MECW_ 25: 269; emphasis added).\nBy contrast, in 1881\n\nMarx distanced himself from the endorsement of endless growth, and pointed to\nthe need for social equality and sustainability based on the principle of\n\n‘communism in living’. This great transformation is comparable to a _coupure_\n_épistémologique_ in the Althusserian sense (Althusser 2005).\n\nOnly after Marx completely abandoned productivism and Eurocentrism was he able\nto fully integrate the principle of a steady-state economy as the foundation\nof the future society. The degrowth communism that Marx was hinting at in the\nlast stage of his life was not an arbitrary interpretation, considering his\npassionate endorsement of the Narodiniks. In addition, the idea of ‘endless\ngrowth’ belongs to the 20th century under the hegemony of GDP growth as if\nthere were not substantial limits to human economic activities (Schmelzer\n2017). In the 19th century, the impossibility of endless growth was rather\nkeenly felt beneath the optimistic tone about future technological progress.\nFor example, Ricardo and Malthus were aware of the insurmountable natural\nlimits in his discussion on the law of diminishing returns. More famously,\nJohn Stuart Mill (1849: 326) argued for the\n\n‘impossibility of ultimately avoiding the stationary state’ due to the falling\nrate of profit in advanced capitalism.38 Furthermore, anarchist communists\nsuch as Peter Kropotkin and Eliseé Reclus, together with ecosocialists such as\nWilliam Morris, also envisioned a future society that is not based upon\nendless material consumption (Ross 2015: 104).39 In this sense, Marx’s high\nevaluation of the Paris Commune as well as of rural communes in non-Western\nsocieties is not exceptional.40\n\nHowever, it is this possibility of Marx as a degrowth communist that even\nEngels was unable to recognize despite their close collaboration. State\nsocialism in the Soviet as well as social democracy in Western Europe in the\n20th century also dismissed such communal forms of regulating social\nproduction and reproduction. Instead, both aimed at modernization and economic\ngrowth. As a result, Marx’s view of history was reduced to a linear and\nproductivist one – ironically quite similar to the capitalist goal of endless\nGDP growth, marginalizing environmental issues and suppressing other\nemancipatory imaginaries.41 Many still believe that Marxism and degrowth\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n210 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ are incompatible (Schwartzman 1996). Marxists\nstick to the belief in the need for further growth in order to improve the\nliving conditions of the working class. Even those ecological Marxists who\nclearly distance themselves from such a naïve vision of abundance are hesitant\nto accept the idea of degrowth, as Michael Löwy (2020) writes: ‘Since these\nand similar measures of draconian austerity risk being quite unpopular, some\nof them … play with the idea of a sort of “ecological dictatorship”.42\n\nHowever, it was John Bellamy Foster, referring to Lewis Mumford’s ‘basic\ncommunism’, who pointed to the need for the transition of high-income\ncountries to a steady-state economy in order to avoid ecological breakdown:\nTherefore, society, particularly in rich countries, must move towards a\nsteady-state economy, which requires a shift to an economy without net capital\nformation, one that stays within the solar budget. Development, particularly\nin the rich economies, must assume a new form: qualitative, collective, and\ncultural – emphasizing sustainable human development in harmony with Marx’s\noriginal view of socialism. (Foster 2015: 9) Nevertheless, Foster, who usually\npassionately defends the consistency of Marx’s ecology, does not make it clear\nwhether a steady-state economy is compatible with Marx’s own view of post-\ncapitalism. By comprehending the theoretical potentialities of the late Marx\nthere emerges a new path to enrich a Marxist vision of an alternative to\ncapitalism. The final chapter attempts to push Marx’s unfinished critique of\ncapitalism beyond _Capital_ by revisiting it from the perspective of degrowth\ncommunism in order to envision a post-scarcity economy in the Anthropocene.\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nEngels’s notebooks are just a few volumes in the _MEGA_ while Marx’s 200\n\nnotebooks occupy a large part of its fourth section. Marx’s financial\ndifficulties are not the only reason he had to visit the British Museum to\ngather materials necessary for writing _Capital_. The young Marx had already\nacquired the habit of studying new materials by taking notes.\n\n2\n\nThese marks and lines are deleted in Engels’s edition as well as in the recent\nEnglish translation of the manuscript (Marx 2015).\n\n3\n\nAnother reason for this cleaning up was that Engels used the text dictated by\nEisengarten in order to edit Marx’s manuscript.\n\n4\n\nFoster (1998: 171) puts forward another interpretation of these passages that\nis more sympathetic to Marx and Engels. While Foster treats Marx as a\nconsistent ecologist since the 1840s, I argue that Marx became an ecologist\nonly in the 1860s.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 211\n\n5\n\nFraas is hardly known today, but his strong influence is discernible in the\nwork of George Perkins Marsh’s _Man and Nature_ (1864), a work that\ncontributed to launching the modern conservation movement in the USA.\n\n6 The fourth section of the _MEGA_ is now published online. The notebook\n\n‘London. 1868’ that contains excerpts from Jevons’s book can be found here:\nhttps://megadigital.bbaw.de/exzerpte/detail.xql?id=M0004847&sec=1\n\n(accessed 7 September 2022).\n\n7\n\nEmphasizing the importance of cheap coal for British capitalism, Jevons\nreferred to Liebig: ‘Civilisation, says Baron Liebig, is _the economy of\npower_ , and our power is coal’ (Jevons 1865: 105; emphasis in original).\n\n8\n\nJoel Kovel (2001: 80) doubts that Marx recognized the intrinsic value of\nnature.\n\nAccording to Kovel, Marx treated nature merely as humanity’s instrument, but\nthis kind of criticism can be refuted by remarks recorded in Marx’s notebooks.\n\nKovel instead endorses an aesthetic intuition of nature’s value, as suggested\nby Jakob Böhme, which marks a retreat into idealism and romanticism. This is a\ntypical tendency within environmentalism, as exemplified by deep ecology (Næss\n1973), when it attempts to go beyond anthropocentrism.\n\n9\n\nIn the manuscript for volume II of _Capital_ , Marx also came up with another\nexample from stock farming about the constant pressure to shorten the time\nrequired for rearing, quoting from William Walter Good’s _Political,\nAgricultural_ _and Commercial Fallacies_(1866). There exists a biological\nlimit to the shortening of production time, which leads to the premature\nslaughter of animals ( _Capital_ II: 313). Marx referred to Robert Bakewell’s\nattempt to shorten the time for rearing through his careful breeding ‘system\nof selection’, lamenting the growing sickliness of animals raised for profit (\n_MEGA_ IV/18: 232).\n\n10 Thierry Drapeau (2017) argues that Marx already took an anti-colonial and\nabolitionist position to be an essential component of anti-capitalism in 1853,\nafter he was inspired by Ernest Jones’s denunciation of British imperialism\nand his argument about the need for the working class to support resistance\nmovements against British rule abroad. Influenced by Jones, Marx, Drapeau\nargues, condemned British rule in India as an example of ‘the inherent\nbarbarism of bourgeois civilization’ in his famous article ‘The Future Results\nof British Rule in India’. However, Drapeau does not give a convincing account\nof the passage from Marx already quoted about the progressive character of\nBritish imperialism. Furthermore, Engels argued even more explicitly in his\nspeech on Poland in 1847 that ‘a nation cannot become free and at the same\ntime continue to oppress other nations’ ( _MECW_ 6: 389). If Marx were so\ndramatically influenced by Richard Jones in the beginning of the 1850s through\ntheir collaboration, Engels must have had a much stronger influence upon\nMarx’s view of anti-colonialism already in the 1840s.\n\n11 As discussed here, I disagree, although it is true that Marx did not\nelaborate on these points in published writings. At the same time, I agree\nwith his discussion on Marx’s history consisting of ‘History 1’ and ‘History\n2’. Such a conception constitutes his methodological core as discussed here.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n212 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ 12 Marx’s evaluation of Haxthausen was also\nquite negative. He wrote in 1858\n\nthat ‘we shall have proof of the full extent to which the worthy Privy\nCouncilor Haxthausen has allowed himself to be hoodwinked by the [Russian]\n“authorities”\n\nand by the peasants those authorities have trained’ ( _MECW_ 40: 346).\n\n13 This English translation is taken from J. White (2019: 8).\n\n14 Haxthausen assumed that Russian communes differ from Germanic ones, but he\nemphasized the similarities of the two types of communes throughout his\nanalysis.\n\n15 This modification is not reflected in the standard English translations.\n\n16 It is generally assumed that Marx’s letter to the _Otechestvenniye Zapiski_\neditorial board was written in November 1877 soon after the publication of\nMikhalovsky’s article. But the expression in the letter to Danielson dated 15\nNovember 1878,\n\n‘the other, I think, of Michailoff ’, indicates that Marx was not really\nfamiliar with Mikhalovsky’s claims until then.\n\n17 These passages are not available in English translation of the excerpts\npublished in Krader (1975).\n\n18 Marx distanced himself from Kovalevsky in this point as the latter also\napplied\n\n‘feudalism in the West European sense of the term’ to India. Marx pointed out\nthat Kovalevsky misses that fact that ‘serfdom’, the essential component of\nfeudalism, does not exist in India (Krader 1975: 383).\n\n19 Hans-Peter Harstick thus wrote: ‘Im ganzen plädiert Marx für eine\ndifferenzierte Betrachtung der asiatischen und europäischen Geschichte und\nzielt seine Argumentation gegen eine zu starke Generalisierung des\nFeudalismusbegriffs und überhaupt gegen die simple Übertragung von am Modell\nWesteuropas entwickelten Strukturbegriffen auf indische oder asiatische\nVerhältnisse’\n\n(Harstick 1977: 13).\n\n20 Here I follow Hinada (1975) who argued that the order of writing these\nthree drafts was actually Second, First, and Third.\n\n21 Once Marx argued that ‘the Asiatic or Indian property forms everywhere mark\nthe beginning’ ( _MECW_ 42: 547), but he corrected his view here.\n\n22 Wada (1975: 206) highlighted the difference between Marx and Engels. Marx\nwas more passionate about the possibility of a Russian revolution than Engels.\n\nEngels wrote in 1875 that\n\nthe possibility undeniably exists of raising this form of society to a higher\none … without it being necessary for the Russian peasants to go through the\nintermediate stage of bourgeois small holdings.\n\nThis, however, can only happen if, before the complete break-up of communal\nownership, a proletarian revolution is successfully carried out in Western\nEurope, creating for the Russian peasant the preconditions requisite for such\na transition, particularly the material things he needs.\n\n( _MECW_ 24: 48)\n\nBut in the Russian edition of the _Manifesto_ the initiative lies in Russia,\nalthough the Russian preface was written by Engels. Wada finds evidence for\nMarx’s intervention here. Marx and Engels clearly shared the view that Russia\ncould https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 213\n\nfollow the non-Western path to socialism at that time, but Engels emphasized\nthe need for a Western proletarian revolution as a condition for the success\nof Russian revolution. After Marx’s death, Engels also judged that the time\nfor a Russian revolution based on the agricultural communes had already\npassed.\n\n23 Marx wrote: ‘The “rural commune” may also be found in Asia, among the\nAfghans, etc. But it everywhere appears as the most recent type – the last\nword, so to speak, in the archaic formation of societies’ (Shanin 1984: 119).\n\n24 This is not entirely the case. Marx was greatly inspired by Maksim M.\nKovalevsky, and he is of a younger generation than Maurer and Morgan, and\nKovalevsky did not solely focus on ‘outdated’ philological study. Stedman\nJones intentionally marginalizes the importance of Marx’s extensive notebook\non Kovalevsky, only mentioning his work in a short single paragraph. This is\nunfair. In addition, as Kolja Lindner (2010: 36) argues, Marx’s conceptual\napproach ‘has not lost all relevance’, even if some of his analysis of the\nRussian rural communes is based on erroneous information. For example, with\nregard to the section titled ‘Forms Which Precede Capitalist Production’ in\nthe _Grundrisse_ , its description has also been criticized for its inaccurate\nhistorical assumptions about Asian, Roman and Germanic societies. Once the\ntheoretical aim become clear, it is not necessary to abandon Marx’s insight\ndue to some errors in terms of historical facts. As Ellen M. Wood has argued:\n\nMarx was indeed seriously wrong in his historical observations, for reasons\nhaving less to do with his own shortcomings than with the existing state of\nhistorical scholarship at the time of his writing the _Grundrisse_ ; but the\nedifice he constructed on the foundation of this faulty knowledge reveals the\npower, not the weakness, of historical materialism as he conceived it, which\npushed him beyond the limitations of existing scholarship. (E. Wood 2008: 79)\n\nHowever, the late Marx went further. Marx was not studying these regions\nsimply to recognize the specificity of capitalism but also to comprehend the\nrevolutionary vitality of these non-Western communes, which compelled him to\nrethink the revolutionary path in the West as well.\n\n25 In the bibliographic list made in 1881, Marx listed 115 books that he found\nimportant. In Marx’s bookshelves, there were 67 books in Russian.\n\n26 Not only Anderson and Stedman Jones, but also Kolja Lindner (2010) and\nMarcello Musto (2020) do not pay attention to Marx’s treatment of ecological\nissues in their discussion of his engagement with non-Western societies. As a\nresult, they all tend to reduce the theoretical importance of Marx’s notebooks\nto a tool for replying to questions and criticisms posed by post-colonial\nstudies.\n\n27 In this sense, unlike Stedman Jones’s assumption, Marx’s recognition of the\nvitality of Russian communes as a place of resistance against capital is by no\nmeans equal to ‘idealizing’ communal society. In fact, in his letter to\nZasulich, Marx did not call for a return in the Western countries to rural\nagrarian communes nor uncritically endorse their rural life. Marx was always\nconcerned about the exclusive, patriarchal and conservative characteristics of\ntraditional https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n214 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ communes. As far as I know, only Masami\nFukutomi (1970: 172) insists that the actual content of the letter to Zasulich\nhas to do with Marx’s formulation of post-capitalist society in Western\nEurope. However, he did not elaborate on this in detail.\n\n28 As indicated earlier, Marx wrote the manuscripts for volume II of _Capital_\n, which are now available in _MEGA_ II/4.3 and II/11. Marx prepared eight\nmanuscripts for volume II of _Capital_ and the last one was written in the\nfirst half of 1881, using the same paper as his letter to Zasulich. In terms\nof the content, Marx in the eighth manuscript largely solved the remaining\nproblems of volume II, especially with regard to the reproduction scheme (\n_MEGA_ II/11). Stedman Jones (2016) does not refer to this manuscript either,\nin order to give impression that Marx in the 1880s had already completely lost\nhis intellectual capacity and fell into romantic nostalgy.\n\n29 Notably, Liebig also discussed pre-capitalist society in his critique of\nrobbery praxis (Liebig 1862), but Marx did not pay attention to it and did not\nmake excerpts on these relevant sections in 1864, which indicates the\nexpansion of his interest after 1868 (Saito 2017).\n\n30 Marx later made excerpts from Maurer twice in the 1870s. This indicates how\nimportant Maurer was for him. Although unpublished, it would be necessary to\ninvestigate these later notebooks to trace the shifts in Marx’s interests in\nmore detail.\n\n31 Marx also read Maurer’s _Geschichte der Dorfverfassung_ in 1876. It would\nbe necessary to examine these excerpts in order to more concretely discuss\nMarx’s interest in Maurer’s work.\n\n32 As Tomonaga Tairako (2016) points out, there is also a change in Marx’s\nconception of property in the Teutonic communes after having read Maurer’s\nbook compared with the _Grundrisse_. Such a shift needs to be reexamined from\nan ecological perspective.\n\n33 These excerpts will be published in _MEGA_ IV/24.\n\n34 Maurer insisted that some aspects of these agrarian communes remained even\ninto the 19th century:\n\nFolgt aus dem zu Cäsars Zeiten bei allen Germanen, insbes. auch den Sueven 25\ngeltenden jährlichen Wechsel des Besitzes u. den jedes Jahr neuerdings wieder\nvorgenommenen Anweisungen v. Grund u. Boden (Cäsar IV, I, VI, 22.), noch zu\nTacitus Zeit (Germ. c. 26. arva (das Ackerland) per annos mutant\\wechseln sie\njährlich, et superest ager (u.\n\nGemeindeland bleibt übrig, d.h. eine gemeine, unvertheilte Mark.)), in\nDeutschland hier 30 u. da bis auf unsre Tage fortgedauert. ( _MEGA_ IV/18:\n544)\n\n35 According to Andrzej Walicki (1969: 189), Marx’s letter to Zasulich also\nfollows Chernyshevsky’s. The ‘reasoning of Marx bears much resemblance to\nNikolay Chernyshevsky’s _Critique of Philosophical Prejudices against the_\n_Communal_ https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_Marx as a Degrowth Communist_ | 215\n\n_Ownership of the Land_ ’. This is another important source of his\ninspiration, which Wada (1975) summarizes.\n\n36 In this context, Haxthausen also compared the Russian agrarian commune with\nexisting communism in his _Zustand_. It was Chernyshevsky who strongly\ninfluenced Marx to pay attention to Haxthausen through his review of the book\nand of the revolutionary potentials of Russian communes in the 1870s.\n\n37 As Caesar argued in the following paragraph, even the existence of wasted\nlands was intentional because it was meant to show the power of a commune to\nother people:\n\nIt is the greatest glory to the several states to have as wide deserts as\npossible around them, their frontiers having been laid waste. They consider\nthis the real evidence of their prowess, that their neighbors shall be driven\nout of their lands and abandon them, and that no one dare settle near them; at\nthe same time they think that they shall be on that account the more secure,\nbecause they have removed the apprehension of a sudden incursion.\n\n38 Marx was highly critical of Mill, and he never discussed Mill’s ‘stationary\nstate’.\n\nThe comparison here is simply meant to indicate that the idea of a steady-\nstate economy was not entirely alien to classical political economy.\nChernyshevsky’s _Outlines of Political Economy According to Mill_ does not\ndeal with Mill’s discussion of the steady-state economy either, so it is\nunlikely that Marx’s engagement with the book in 1870 contributed to changing\nhis view of Mill’s prediction about the future of capitalism.\n\n39 One thing that Ross (2015: 77) highlights and this book cannot analyse in\ndetail with regard to the post-capitalist imaginary is Marx’s encounter with\nthe Paris Commune, which was ‘enormously generative’ for his thinking. It is\nnecessary to examine more carefully how his experience altered his frame of\nperception and opened up a new field of the possible. Ross argues furthermore\nthat Marx’s attraction to the Russian _obshchina_ was because he found there\nthe traces of the primary communism observed in the Paris Commune.\n\n40 Kristin Ross (2015: 104) proposes the concept of ‘anarchist communism’,\nwhich is quite similar to what I call degrowth communism in this book.\n\n41 As Ross (2015: 78) points out, Marx added in the second German edition of\n_The_ _Communist Manifesto_ published in 1872 that ‘the working class cannot\nsimply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for their own\npurpose’\n\n( _MECW_ 23: 175). This remark indicates that his experience of the Commune\nprompted him to rethink his earlier strategy of state centralization.\n\n42 One exception is the open endorsement of degrowth and Marxian economics by\nMax Koch (2019), but he simply uses Marx’s critique of endless capital\naccumulation as an inspiration for his degrowth theories without asking\nwhether degrowth is compatible with Marx’s own view.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.007 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n**7**\n\n\n## **The Abundance of Wealth in**\n\n**Degrowth Communism** *\n\nIn the ‘Paralipomena’ (or side notes) to _On the Concept of History_ , Walter\nBenjamin (2003: 393) once criticized the Marxist conception of labour for its\ncharacteristic ‘exploitation of nature’. In an attempt to overcome the\nPromethean vision of revolution, Benjamin famously wrote: Marx says that\nrevolutions are the locomotive of world history. But perhaps it is quite\notherwise. Perhaps revolutions are an attempt by passengers on this train –\nnamely, the human race – to activate the emergency brake. (Benjamin 2003: 402)\n\nThe metaphor of the ‘emergency brake’ is more important than ever today.\n\nIn the face of ecological disasters, environmentalism starts to demand radical\nsystemic change by ending limitless economic growth in order to terminate the\nceaseless exploitation of humanity and the robbery of nature. In short,\ntoday’s emergency brake implies a call for degrowth.1\n\nMarxism has been, however, unable to adequately respond to this call for\ndegrowth. Even those eco-Marxists who are critical of productivism are\nreluctant to accept the idea of degrowth, which they believe is politically\nunattractive and ineffective. Instead, they stick to the possibility of\nfurther sustainable growth under socialism, once the anarchy of market\ncompetition under capitalism is transcended (Vergara-Camus 2019). Thus, even\nafter the idea of ecosocialism has softened the long-lasting antagonism\nbetween\n\n* A part of this chapter draws on material from ‘Primitive Accumulation as the Cause of Economic and Ecological Disaster’, in _Rethinking Alternatives with Marx_ , ed.\n\nMarcello Musto (New York: Palgrave, 2021), 93–112.

The situation is changing, however. One of the most important\nadvocates of degrowth, Serge Latouche (2019: 65), has accepted the idea of\necosocialism as a basis for degrowth, advocating the need ‘to propose forms of\npolitics in a way that is coherent with the objectives of the ecosocialist\nproject for the next era’. Considering the fact that degrowth is often\nconceived as the third path alternative to both capitalism and socialism,2\nthere has been a remarkable shift in recent years among the proponents of\ndegrowth in a clearly _anti-capitalist_ direction. This opens up a space for\nnew dialogues with Marxists, who have been critical of degrowth’s ambiguity in\nterms of its compatibility with the market economy. It is worth investigating\nfurther whether ‘socialism without growth’ (Kallis 2017) and ‘ecosocialist\ndegrowth’ (Löwy et al. 2022) are compatible with Marx’s own vision of post-\ncapitalism.\n\nBased on Marx’s last idea of ‘degrowth communism’ as discovered in the\nprevious chapter, this chapter attempts to fully sublate the long-lasting\nantagonism between Red and Green and create a new space for reviving Marx’s\ntheoretical legacy in the Anthropocene. Since Marx was not able to elaborate\non degrowth communism, it is necessary to revisit the unfinished project of\n_Capital_ _retrospectively_ , from the perspective of degrowth communism, to\nupdate its contents. This is an attempt to go beyond _Capital_ in order to\nconcretize his final vision of post-capitalism. The key for such a\nreconstruction is the ‘negation of the negation’, discussed in one of the most\nfamous passages in volume I of _Capital_.\n\nThis is a passage to which Marx paid careful attention, demonstrated by the\nfact that he modified the passage between the second and the third edition of\n_Capital_.\n\nThis chapter starts with Marx’s theory of ‘primitive accumulation’ as the\nfirst negation of a radical transformation of human metabolic interaction with\nnature. While previous literature on primitive accumulation tends to focus on\nits destructive impact on human life, Marx’s theory of metabolism deals with\nits negative effects on nature too. By fully appreciating the theoretical\nscope of Marx’s discussion of primitive accumulation of capital, one can more\nconcretely envision from an ecological perspective the second negation as the\nre-establishment of the original unity of humans and nature on a higher scale\n(I). Marx’s theory of primitive accumulation also shows that capitalism is\nultimately a social system that constantly increases _scarcity_ rather than\ncreating an abundance of wealth through its incessant increase of productive\nforces. In order to understand this paradoxical point, one needs to revisit\nhis concept of ‘wealth’ in the opening passage of volume I of _Capital_. The\nvery beginning of Marx’s critique of political economy reveals the problems of\nthe narrow conception of wealth in capitalist categories that reduce various\ndimensions of reality to a simple logic of value and thus destroys the\nrichness of society and nature (II). Marx argued that this narrow capitalist\nconception of wealth inevitably turns out to be incompatible with the material\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n218 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ conditions for a sustainable development of\nhuman metabolism with nature.\n\nThrough this critique of the category of capitalist wealth, the Marxian\nunderstanding of ‘abundance’ will be reconfigured in a non-consumerist and\nnon-productivist way. This reconceptualization and reinvention of wealth\nallows us to reconsider various passages related to abundance and wealth in an\nutterly new and more consistent manner. This includes Marx’s discussion of the\nabundance of ‘common wealth’ ( _genossenschaftlicher Reichtum_) in the\n_Critique of the Gotha Programme_. Although it is elaborated in the most\nfamous description of communism in Marx’s writings, ecosocialists often\nsuppressed this well-known passage precisely because the passage looks\nPromethean.\n\nHowever, by correctly understanding the ‘paradox of wealth’, it is possible to\ninterpret the passage in a non-productivist manner (III). Such a new\ninterpretation ultimately solves the fundamental problem that Marx did not\nanswer in _Capital_ , namely, how to repair the ‘irreparable rift’ in\nhumanity’s metabolic interaction with their environment in a post-capitalist\nsociety.\n\nDegrowth communism as a post-scarcity future without economic growth aims to\nreduce the ‘realm of necessity’ and expand the ‘realm of freedom’\n\nwithout necessarily increasing productive forces (IV).\n\n\n## **i**\n\n**PriMitive accuMulatioN as the cause of ecoNoMic** **aNd ecological\ndisaster**\n\nMarx maintained that the typical example of the historical process of\n‘primitive accumulation’ of capital as the precondition for capitalist\ndevelopment can be found in the ‘enclosure’ movement in England. In contrast\nto Adam Smith’s narrative about the formation of the capitalist economy having\nbeen initiated by industrious capitalists who saved money and carefully\ninvested it to increase it, Marx argued that primitive accumulation of capital\nwas a violent and bloody process of separation forcefully ‘divorcing the\nproducer from the means of production’ ( _Capital_ I: 875). As David Harvey\n(2005: 149) succinctly summarizes, primitive accumulation ‘entailed taking\nland, say, enclosing it, and expelling a resident population to create a\nlandless proletariat, and then releasing the land into the privatised\nmainstream of capital accumulation’. After losing means of production and\nsubsistence under the monopoly of lands by the few, peasants were turned into\nprecarious wage-labourers for whom selling their own labour power was their\nonly means to acquire money necessary for living. This process of primitive\nexpropriation continues even today as it ‘not only maintains this separation,\nbut reproduces it on a constantly extending scale’ ( _Capital_ I: 874),\nincreasing the misery of the working class.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 219\n\nWhile it is important to highlight the destructive impact of this violent\nprocess upon direct producers and how it worsened their living conditions, one\nneeds to recall that Marx defined ‘labour’ as a conscious mediating activity\nof the incessant metabolism between humans and nature.3 From this perspective,\nprimitive accumulation as the separation of the original unity of the\nproducers from their objective conditions of production encompasses great\ntransformations in the life of workers _and_ in their relationship with\nnature.4\n\nIn fact, Marx, in the _Grundrisse_ , highlighted the formation of a\nhistorically peculiar chasm between humans and nature due to primitive\naccumulation of capital. He wrote:\n\nIt is not the _unity_ of living and active humanity with the natural,\ninorganic conditions of their metabolic exchange [ _Stoffwechsel_] with\nnature, and hence their appropriation of nature, which requires explanation or\nis the result of a historic process, but rather the separation between these\ninorganic conditions of human existence and this active existence, a\n_separation_ which is completely posited only in the relation of wage labor\nand capital. ( _Grundrisse_ : 489)\n\nIn pre-capitalist societies, as Marx noted, humans retained their ‘unity’ with\nnature. Certainly, slaves and serfs were dominated and exploited by the master\nand the lord. They were unfree and even treated like things. In other words,\nthey were reduced to a part in the objective conditions of production and\nreproduction next to cattle. However, this way of existence, in spite of an\napparent lack of freedom, also prevented the formation of a chasm in their\nmetabolism with nature. As the master does not let cattle starve to death, the\nsatisfaction of the basic needs of slaves and serfs was more or less\nguaranteed in precapitalist societies. In short, the reduction of their\nexistence to a part of inorganic nature like cattle ironically realized what\nMarx called ‘original unity between the worker and the condition of labourer’\n( _MECW_ 33: 340).\n\nThe dissolution of this original unity is a precondition for the\ncommodification of labour power in order to realize full-scale commodity\nproduction. Only when the overwhelming majority of means of subsistence become\ncommodities are they forced to sell their labour as commodities.5\n\nWhat underlies this historical process is the ‘separation’ in the metabolism\nbetween humans and nature that is unique to modern capitalist society.6 As a\nresult of this alienation from nature, labour as the mediation of human\ninteractions with nature came to be carried out in a totally differently\nmanner –\n\nnow the entire production process is thoroughly reorganized for the purpose of\nmaximal capital valorization – so that the expenditure of human labour and\nhuman metabolic exchanges with nature also begin to take on an utterly\ndifferent form. This transformation exerts a powerful influence not only on\nthe economic but also on the ecological sphere. Due to the mediation\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n220 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ of labour, different organizations of social\nlabour and the corresponding reorganization of the metabolism between humans\nand nature in capitalism do harm to _all_ kinds of wealth. Samir Amin (2018:\n85) puts it thus: ‘Marx concludes his radical critique in _Capital_ with the\naffirmation that capitalist accumulation is founded on the destruction of the\nbases of all wealth: human beings and their natural environment.’ Stefania\nBarca also points to the close interrelationship between the degradation of\nliving conditions and that of the natural environment through primitive\naccumulation: ‘From a historical-materialist perspective, the working class,\nor proletariat, and metabolic rift originate from a unique, global process of\nviolent separation of people from their means of subsistence, which also\ndisrupts the biosphere. The ecological crisis is thus a direct consequence of\nclass making’ (Barca 2020: 42).\n\nIn arguing for re-establishing the ‘original unity’ in the future society\nbeyond this alienating separation from nature under capitalism, Marx was\nconsistent with his theory of metabolism: ‘The original unity can be re-\nestablished only on the material foundation which capital creates and by means\nof the revolutions which, in the process of this creation, the working class\nand the whole society undergo’ ( _MECW_ 33: 340). In addition, his remark on\nthe ‘negation of the negation’ in volume I of _Capital_ logically corresponds\nto this reconstitution of the ‘original unity’ as a process of overcoming the\nantagonistic separation in the metabolic exchange between humans and nature.\nHowever, to clarify what needs to be re-established in communism, it is first\nnecessary to grasp more carefully what had to be destroyed in the formation of\ncapitalism through the dissolution of the ‘original unity’ between humans and\nnature. To put it bluntly, it is the ‘wealth’ of society and nature that is\nseverely impoverished under capitalism. It may sound paradoxical to claim that\ncapitalism destroys wealth despite the magnificent increase in productive\nforces it generates. Indeed, our society is filled with an excess of\ncommodities. However, this poverty in plenty constitutes the ‘paradox of\nwealth’\n\n(Foster and Clark 2020: 152).\n\n\n## **ii**\n\n**Marx’s coNcePt of ‘wealth’ aNd the true**\n\n**begiNNiNg of _Capital_**\n\nTo understand this paradox, it is first necessary to adequately comprehend the\nMarxian category of ‘wealth’. Here, the beginning of _Capital_ , volume I,\nfunctions as a useful reference point. Although written in a logical manner\nthat starts with the analysis of the ‘commodity’, the description at the\nbeginning of _Capital_ presupposes the historical process of primitive\naccumulation of capital.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 221\n\nWith this historical presupposition in mind, one notices that the opening\npassage already hints at the fundamental contradiction of capitalism created\nby the historical chasm in the metabolic exchange between humans and nature.\n\nMarx began his discussion of the commodity by writing: The wealth of societies\nin which the capitalist mode of production prevails appears as an ‘immense\ncollection of commodities’; the individual commodity appears as its elementary\nform. Our investigation therefore begins with the analysis of the commodity. (\n_Capital_ I: 125) It is certainly true that _Capital_ starts with the\n‘analysis of the commodity’, but John Holloway demands that we pay attention\nto its true beginning. The subject of the first sentence, which is not the\n‘commodity’ but the ‘wealth’\n\n( _Reichtum_) of societies (Holloway 2015: 5). The verb is also important: the\nwealth of societies ‘appears’ ( _erscheint_) as an ‘immense collection of\ncommodities’\n\nin capitalism. The verb ‘appear’ implies that wealth and commodities ‘are’\n\n(being = _Wesen_) actually not identical, and in fact, the majority of wealth\nin non-capitalist societies does not ‘appear’ as commodities as long as\nnoncapitalist wealth is produced, distributed and consumed without the\nmediation of market exchange. Only under certain social relations does the\nwealth of societies ‘appear’ as the commodity, or in Marxian terminology, the\nproduct of labour receives a ‘commodity form’. Distinguishing _Wesen_ and\n_Erscheinung_ , Marx proceeded in a manner that is true to his own method of\nanalytical dualism of _Stoff_ and _Form_ from the very beginning of _Capital_.\nAccording to this view, ‘wealth’ is the material aspect of the product of\nlabour, while\n\n‘commodity’ appears as its economic form determination.\n\nThe non-identity between wealth and commodity contains a fundamental tension,\nalthough they appear identical in capitalism. Karl Polanyi ([1944]\n\n2001) once warned that ‘land’, ‘labour’ and ‘money’ are ‘fictitious\ncommodities’\n\nthat must not be completely commodified and subjected to the dictates of the\nmarket. Otherwise, says Polanyi, social reproduction will be seriously\nthreatened because they do not properly function under the logic of commodity\nexchange. These three categories can be considered typical forms of ‘wealth’\n\nthat are incompatible with full commodification under capitalism. Yet Marx’s\nconcept of ‘wealth’ is even broader than Polanyi’s and includes other kinds of\nproducts of labour. His intention might be difficult to grasp at first because\nthe contemporary image of ‘wealth’ is often reduced to its capitalist form so\nthat being wealthy ( _reich_) usually signifies having a lot of money and real\nestate. However, wealth does not have to be understood this way. As Holloway\n(2015: 5) argues, the German term _Reichtum_ can be translated to mean\n‘richness’\n\nbecause _reich_ means ‘rich’. Of course, ‘being rich’ can mean the possession\nof a large sum of monetary wealth. Yet it also has broader connotations, such\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n222 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ as richness in taste and smell, experience of\nlife and nature. Thus, its noun _Reichtum_ can be understood as a broader\ncategory of richness than monetary wealth, once it is possible to remove the\ncapitalist constraint imposed upon it.\n\nThis is not an arbitrary claim. Marx wrote in the _Grundrisse_ about the vast\npossibilities of non-capitalist wealth, saying: In fact, however, when the\nlimited bourgeois form is stripped away, what is wealth other than the\nuniversality of individual needs, capacities, pleasures, productive forces\netc., created through universal exchange?\n\nThe full development of human mastery over the forces of nature, those of so-\ncalled nature as well as of humanity’s own nature? The absolute working out of\nhis creative potentialities, with no presupposition other than the previous\nhistoric development, which makes this totality of development, i.e. the\ndevelopment of all human powers as such the end in itself, not as measured on\na predetermined yardstick? … In bourgeois economics – and in the epoch of\nproduction to which it corresponds –\n\nthis complete working-out of the human content appears as a complete emptying-\nout, this universal objectification as total alienation, and the tearing-down\nof all limited, one-sided aims as sacrifice of the human end-in-itself to an\nentirely external end. ( _Grundrisse_ : 488) Marx considered the richness of\nculture, skills, free time and knowledge as the wealth of societies. In other\nwords, the wealth or richness of societies cannot be measured by an ever-\ngreater quantity of commodities produced and their monetary expressions, but\nrather by the full and constant development and realization of the\npotentialities of human beings. The full and all-round development of human\ncapacities and creative potentialities is, however, heavily constrained under\ncapitalism because they are always measured on a ‘predetermined yardstick’,\nnamely, how much use they can be for profit-making. Capitalist production\nsacrifices social wealth under ‘total alienation’\n\nand the ‘complete emptying-out’ of human activities by imposing ‘an entirely\nexternal end’ upon producers solely for the sake of capital valorization.\n\nMarx problematized this tendency of capital as the _impoverishment of social_\n_wealth_ under the accumulation of an ‘immense collection of commodities’.\n\nAgainst this tendency, he maintained that the full realization of human\ncreative potentialities requires stripping away the ‘bourgeois form’ of wealth\nas commodity.\n\nThe wealth of society is not limited to social wealth. Marx also used the\nexpression ‘natural wealth’ ( _natürlicher Reichtum_) to designate the natural\nand material conditions of production and reproduction. For example, he wrote\nin volume I of _Capital_ :\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 223\n\nExternal natural conditions can be divided from the economic point of view\ninto two great classes, namely (1) natural wealth in the means of subsistence,\ni.e. a fruitful soil, waters teeming with fish, etc., and (2) natural wealth\nin the instruments of labour, such as waterfalls, navigable rivers, wood,\nmetal, coal, etc. ( _Capital_ I: 535) The richness of nature in the form of\nland, water, and forests is obviously indispensable for human flourishing as\nmeans of subsistence and production as well as for a healthy life. The\nabundance and quality of natural wealth provided by the earth surely counts as\nthe fundamental ‘wealth’ of all societies:\n\n‘The earth is the reservoir, from whose bowels the use-values are to be torn’\n\n( _MECW_ 31: 465). This statement is consistent with Marx’s recognition of the\nessential contribution of nature to the production process: ‘Labour is not the\nsource of all wealth. Nature is just as much the source of use values (and it\nis surely of such that material wealth consists!) as labour’ ( _MECW_ 24: 81).\n\nHowever, out of the commodification of social and natural wealth, there arises\nan increasing tension between ‘wealth’ and ‘commodity’ because commodities\nfocus one-sidedly on the value of the labour product and marginalize that\nwhich does not possess value because the ‘predetermined yardstick’ does not\nproperly function for them. This tension is visible in terms of nature. On the\none hand, natural forces are thoroughly exploited by capital as ‘free gifts’:\n‘Natural elements which go into production as agents without costing anything,\nwhatever role they might play in production, do not go in as components of\ncapital, but rather as a free natural power of capital’\n\n( _Capital_ III: 879). Nature enters the labour process and aids in the\nproduction of commodities together with workers but does not enter the\nvalorization process as it is not a product of labour. Nature is free, and\ncapital seeks to utilize its power as much as possible. Capital’s treatment of\nnature strengthens the destruction and squandering of the richness of nature\nin favour of capital’s incessant valorization. Nevertheless, nature remains\nthe material ‘bearer’ of wealth as well as value. Wealth is often something\nthat capital does not create by itself (capital creates neither knowledge and\nculture nor land and water), and wealth has its own characteristics and\ndynamics that are independent of and incompatible with capital’s aims.\nConsequently, as use-value is subordinated to exchange value under the logic\nof capital’s valorization that is blind to its own material substance, the\ncontradiction manifests as metabolic rift.\n\nOn the other hand, nature is increasingly commodified because wild nature is\nworthless when left as it is. Its commodification, however, occurs by\ndissolving the abundance of social and natural wealth. Enclosure dissolved the\ncommons, commodifying lands and expelling the people living on them.\n\nNature was devastated after the expulsion from the land of peasants who had\ntaken care of it. Capitalist farmers sought only short-term profit without\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n224 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ taking good care of the soil. Quoting various\nreports, Marx in volume I of _Capital_ , especially in the French edition,\nalso pointed to the fact that the most fertile lands in Scotland were totally\nlaid waste after the enclosure. These lands were actually intentionally left\nwasted for the sake of a more profitable usage: Immense tracts of land, much\nof which is described in the statistical account of Scotland as having a\npasturage in richness and extent of very superior description, are thus shut\nout from all cultivation and improvement, and are solely devoted to the sport\nof a few persons for a very brief period of the year. ( _Capital_ I: 894)\nApparently, this transformation of land usage had an immense impact on the\ndaily life of people in the countryside, as seen in the general impoverishment\nof people’s living conditions through the second enclosure in the 18th\ncentury.\n\nWhile the agricultural revolution based on the Norfolk four-course system\nsignificantly increased the production of wheat, peasants lost access to\ncommon lands and forests, where they used to raise pigs with acorns, collect\nmushrooms, woods and fruits, and catch birds. Living in the countryside, they\nalso had access to the river to catch fish and for fresh water. Now driven\ninto the city, they almost completely lost access to such natural wealth and\ncould consume much less meat. Even if they remained in the countryside, their\nprevious daily activities in the commons were now criminalized as acts of\ntrespass and theft.\n\nFurthermore, enclosure concentrated lands in the hands of fewer capitalist\nfarmers. As they hired peasants only during the busy season and fired them\nthereafter, the farming villages disappeared, and the small vegetable gardens\nmaintained by the villagers ceased to provide fresh vegetables for their\ndinner tables. As it was no longer clear by whom and how the vegetables sold\nin the market were grown – they might, for example, be smeared with excreta of\ncattle and poultry – they became inedible without cooking, and fresh salads\ndisappeared from the menu.\n\nIn addition, all family members had to work in the factories to make a living\nin the city. The loss of access to the commons significantly increased the\nfinancial burden on households because now they had to buy their means of\nsubsistence from the market. They began working in factories from an early\nage, so children were not able to attend school. They could not acquire basic\ncooking skills at home or during the festivals and ceremonies of the farming\nvillages, where they were served free and luxurious meals. Even if they\nacquired and maintained some cooking skills, working-class families in the\ncity were no longer able to buy expensive meat and other ingredients but only\nthe cheap potatoes that were sold on the street. Consequently, the traditional\nEnglish recipes based on ingredients available to the rural villages became\nuseless for working-class families living in the large cities.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 225\n\nFinally, English food culture was destroyed by adulteration. Marx documented\nthis custom in volume I of _Capital_ , explaining the adulteration of bread\nwith alum, soap, pearl ash and chalk based on Arthur Hill Hassall’s work\n_Adulterations_ _Detected_. Adulteration was quite widespread as a way of\nreducing production costs and of providing cheap food for the poor working\nclass: the worker ‘had to eat daily in his bread a certain quantity of human\nperspiration mixed with the discharge of abscesses, cobwebs, dead cockroaches\nand putrid German yeast, not to mention alum, sand and other agreeable mineral\ningredients’ ( _Capital_ I: 359). The problem was not limited to bread.\n\nHassall reported various adulterations in milk, butter, vegetables, and beer\n(Hassall 1861). These foods were apparently unhealthy and unsafe, but since\nthey were cheap, the poor working class had to depend on them in order to fill\ntheir hungry stomachs.\n\nIn short, culture, skills and knowledge were impoverished, the financial\nburden for working-class families increased, and the quality of natural wealth\nwas sacrificed as the world became increasingly commodified.\n\nFrom the perspective of capital, the same situation looks very different,\nhowever. Paradoxically, this is how capitalism took off, emancipating the full\npotentialities of productive forces, as workers became more and more dependent\non commodities in the market.\n\nThis tension between wealth and the commodity is what underlies\n\n‘Lauderdale’s paradox’ (Daly 1998: 22). James Maitland, the eighth Earl of\nLauderdale pointed to an inverse relationship between ‘public wealth’ and\n\n‘private riches’. Namely, if one increases, the other decreases. According to\nLauderdale, this is a paradox that Adam Smith overlooked in believing that the\n‘wealth of nations’ is an aggregate sum of ‘private riches’. He demonstrated\nthis point by introducing the third concept of ‘public wealth’.\n\nLauderdale defined ‘public wealth’ as consisting ‘of all that man desires, as\nuseful or delightful to him’. In contrast, ‘private riches’ has an additional\ncharacter, in that it comprises ‘all that man desires as useful or delightful\nto him; which exists in a degree of scarcity’ (Lauderdale 1819: 57–8). The\ndifference between the two concepts is ‘scarcity’. Expressed in Marxian terms,\n‘public wealth’ possesses ‘use-value’, but not ‘value’ because it exists\nabundantly in nature and is available to everyone that wishes to use it in\norder to satisfy their needs. Public wealth includes the air, common lands,\nforests, and river water.\n\n‘Public wealth’, however, can be turned into ‘private riches’ when it becomes\nscarce. Lauderdale argued that scarcity does not necessarily arise from the\nexhaustion of natural resources. It is often _intentionally created_ by\nconstructing gates and by forcefully expelling people from the land. In other\nwords, land, water and food are artificially made scarce so that they can\nfunction to augment the ‘private riches’ of their owners expressed in monetary\nterms (as https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n226 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ well as the wealth of nation that comprises\nthe sum total of individual riches).\n\nThe obvious problem here is, as Lauderdale argued, that the increase in\nprivate riches is inevitably accompanied by the augmentation of scarcity in a\nsociety, that is, the decrease in the free and abundant common public wealth\nfor the majority of the people. As seen in the primitive accumulation of\ncapital, common lands and forests were gated and became inaccessible and\nscarce for peasants, which increased the misery of the masses and the\ndevastation of the natural environment, while this process of creating\nartificial scarcity amplified private riches of the few.\n\nWhile there obviously exists ‘natural’ scarcity of arable lands and available\nwater independently of humans, scarcity under capitalism is different. It is a\n\n‘social’ one. This social scarcity is also an ‘artificial’ one because the\nrichness of social and natural wealth was originally abundant in the sense\nthat they did not possess value and were accessible to members of the\ncommunity.\n\nScarcity must be _created_ by thoroughly destroying the commons, even if this\nbrings about a disastrous situation for the many in an economic and ecological\nsense. Lauderdale provided cases where edible products were intentionally\nthrown away and arable lands were deliberately wasted, so that market supply\ncould be limited in order to keep commodity prices high. Herein manifests the\nfundamental tension between wealth and the commodity, and this is the\n\n‘paradox of wealth’ that marks the historical peculiarity of the capitalist\nsystem (Foster and Clark 2009).\n\nIt is in this sense of the term that the opposition of ‘abundance’ and\n\n‘scarcity’ needs to be discussed. No matter how much capitalism increases the\nproductive forces, this paradox of wealth does not disappear but is rather\nintensified due to the constant creation of artificial scarcity. At the same\ntime, it is not necessary to maximize productive forces in order to overcome\nthis kind of scarcity. A post-scarcity society could be founded upon the\nreconstruction of the abundance of the commons found in pre-capitalist\nsocieties on a higher scale, through the transcendence of artificial scarcity.\nMarx’s degrowth communism aims to repair the ‘irreparable’ metabolic rift and\nto rehabilitate the non-consumerist ‘abundance’ of the social and natural\nwealth beyond the Lauderdale paradox through the ‘negation of the negation’.\n\n\n## **iii**\n\n**the NegatioN of the NegatioN aNd the abuNdaNce** **iN coMMuNisM**\n\nPrimitive accumulation of capital, as the first negation, dismantles\nindividual property as founded on the labour of its proprietor.

This is the negation of the negation. It does not re-establish\nprivate property, but it does indeed establish individual property on the\nbasis of the achievements of the capitalist era: namely co-operation and the\npossession in common of the land and the means of production produced by labor\nitself. ( _Capital_ I: 929) Interestingly, this passage was modified in the\nthird edition based on Marx’s comments in his own copy of the second edition\nof _Capital_. He modified this passage in the 1880s shortly before his death.\nIn the second edition, he still wrote:\n\nIt is the negation of negation. This re-establishes individual property, but\non the basis of the acquisitions of the capitalist era, i.e., on co-operation\nof free workers and their possession in common of the land and of the means of\nproduction produced by labour. ( _MEGA_ II/6: 683) Marx modified this passage\nin the third edition in order to more explicitly distinguish between ‘private\nproperty’ and ‘individual property’. What does this change imply?\n\nIn the _Civil War in France_ published in 1871, Marx came back to this problem\nof individual property in communism with the same logic in his mind, as is\nseen clearly in the expression ‘the expropriation of the expropriators’:\n\n… the Commune intended to abolish that class-property which makes the labour\nof the many the wealth of the few. It aimed at the expropriation of the\nexpropriators. It wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming\nthe means of production, land and capital, now chiefly the means of enslaving\nand exploiting labour, into mere instruments of free and associated labour….\nIf co-operative production\n\n[ _genossenschaftliche Produktion_] is not to remain a sham and a snare; if it\nis to supersede the Capitalist system; if united co-operative societies are to\nregulate national production upon a common plan, thus taking it under their\nown control, and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical\nconvulsions which are the fatality of Capitalist production –\n\nwhat else, gentlemen, would it be but Communism, ‘possible’\n\nCommunism? ( _MECW_ 22: 335)\n\nThe Paris Commune was an attempt to ‘make individual property a truth’\n\nthrough the negation of the negation. As explained in the second half of the\nquoted passage, ‘co-operative production’ aims to regulate social production\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n228 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ through common planning and communal control\nof the means of production.\n\nIn this way, it allocates individual shares among members through democratic\nand communal management. This is how ‘individual property’ is rehabilitated.\n\nIn a sense, individual property is equivalent to ‘co-operative’ (\n_genossenschaftlich_) property. For Marx, this is ‘possible Communism’. Here\nhe seems to have established the concept of ‘individual property’ as clearly\ndistinguished from\n\n‘private property’, which led to the modification of the relevant expression\nin the third edition of _Capital_.7\n\nYet the Paris Commune was not the only reason for this modification.\n\nConsidering the fact that he modified the relevant passage on post-capitalist\nsociety in the 1880s for the third edition of _Capital_ , it needs to be\nexamined in relation to his view on the rural communes elaborated in his\nletter to Zasulich.\n\nMarx wrote as follows in his letter to Zasulich when he returned to this\ntopic: The peoples among which it reached its highest peak in Europe and\n\n[the United States of] America seek only to break its chains by replacing\ncapitalist with co-operative production [ _la production coopérative]_ , and\ncapitalist property with a higher form of the archaic type of property, that\nis, communist property. (Shanin 1984: 102) Here again, Marx argues that\ndeveloped capitalist societies need to return to a ‘higher form of the archaic\ntype’ after transcending the system of private property in capitalism. In a\nsense, he went further here than in the _Civil War in France_. What Marx\ndemanded in the _Civil War in France_ as the ‘united co-operative societies’\nis now specified in that they should be realized through the principles of a\nsteady-state economy imminent to the archaic commune. ‘Communist property’ is\nnot just based on ‘co-operative’\n\n( _genossenschaftliche_) production, but also seeks to revive a communal form\nof property in Mauer’s sense of ‘mark cooperative’ ( _Markgenossenschaft_) _._\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, the archaic commune was characterized by\nthe ‘dualism’ of collectivism and individualism. This dualism needs to be\nrehabilitated in Western Europe not by going back to isolated small-scale\nproduction in rural communes but by transforming the large-scale production\ndeveloped under capitalism into co-operative production. Private property is\nturned into individual property, but its content can be better expressed as\n\n‘co-operative’ ( _genossenschaftliche_) property as the higher form of the\narchaic type. Indeed, this understanding will prove decisive in interpreting\nthe term\n\n‘communal wealth’ ( _genossenschaftlicher Reichtum_), which appears in Marx’s\nfamous description of communism in the _Critique of the Gotha Programme_.\n\nThere is another important term worth paying attention to in the passage on\nthe ‘negation of the negation’ in _Capital_. The term ‘land’ used in the quote\nabove is _Erde_ in German. It also means ‘earth’. In fact, Marx used this\nexpression to designate natural resources other than land too. Marx argued\nthat the earth https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 229\n\n(natural resources) must be controlled ‘in common’, meaning that it must be\nused cautiously, so as to care for the interests of future generations. Marx\nwrote in volume III of _Capital_ , in which the term _Erde_ is translated as\n‘earth’, saying: From the standpoint of a higher socioeconomic formation, the\nprivate property of particular individuals in the earth will appear just as\nabsurd as the private property of one man in other men. Even an entire\nsociety, a nation, or all simultaneously existing societies taken together,\nare not the owners of the earth. They are simply its possessors, its\nbeneficiaries, and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding\ngenerations, as _boni patres familias._ ( _Capital_ III: 911) The earth is\nwhat the current generation succeeded from the previous one, and they are\nobliged to pass it on to the next generation without destroying it. This,\nhowever, is what capitalism cannot fulfil due to its one-sided focus on the\nendless augmentation of private riches. By contrast, the perspective of\nsustainability is essential for enriching social and natural wealth,\nespecially because capitalism is a system of profit-making, private property\nand anarchic competition. Against the logic of commodification by capital,\ncommunism seeks the _commonification_ of wealth. However, this statement must\nnot be understood as the full realization of human desire to enjoy the world’s\nriches without any constraint. Marx was well aware that the availability of\nnatural wealth is inevitably limited and cannot be arbitrarily utilized for\nsatisfying unlimited human desires. This is why the ‘negation of the negation’\ntranscends artificial scarcity, but not scarcity as such.\n\nThis ecosocialist insight must be contrasted with the popularized vision of\nsocialist society where material abundance is supposed to become almost\ninfinite, so that the working class can enjoy the same luxurious life without\nnatural limits. In _Self-Ownership, Freedom and Equality_ , G. A. Cohen\ndescribes abundance under communism in this manner. According to Cohen’s left-\nwing libertarian interpretation, Marx’s vision of an equal society is still\ntrapped in\n\n‘certain radical bourgeois values’ (Cohen 1995: 116). He held ‘a conviction\nthat industrial progress brings society to a condition of such fluent\nabundance that it is possible to supply what everyone needs for a richly\nfulfilling life’\n\n(Cohen 1995: 10). Infinite material abundance is the condition of material\nequality for all, but such a productivist negation of natural limits in the\nfuture society is absolutely incompatible with the planetary boundaries that\nexist independently of human will. Thus, Cohen concludes that it is no longer\npossible to ‘sustain Marx’s extravagant, pre-green, materialist optimism’, and\nit is necessary to ‘abandon the vision of abundance’ (Cohen 1995: 10).\n\nCohen is surely right in emphasizing the need to reject the extravagant and\nproductivist vision of social and economic equality in socialism. Yet this\nrejection does not require abandoning the ‘vision of abundance’ in Marx’s\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n230 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ critique of capitalism. In fact, Marx’s\ncritique of political economy would be inconsistent and mediocre if he so\nnaively endorsed ‘bourgeois values’. In order to avoid this confusion, one\nneeds to understand the category of ‘scarcity’\n\nas an inherently socio-historical category. According to Marx, scarcity has\ntwo aspects, social and natural. Natural scarcity cannot be entirely overcome,\nno matter how much technology may advance. By contrast, social scarcity\nincreases in capitalism in the face of unlimited capital expansion. Everything\nis by definition scarce in capitalism: ‘ _capital always is –_ and, this\ncannot be stressed strongly enough, it _always must remain_ , as a matter of\ninner systemic determination – insuperably _scarce_ , even when under certain\nconditions it is contradictorily _overproduced’_ (Mészáros 2012: 304; emphasis\nin original). The more capital develops for the sake of overcoming self-\nimposed scarcity, the more destructive the entire system becomes, but the\nabundance it generates can never eliminate the artificial scarcity created by\ncapital itself. This is the fundamental paradox of wealth in capitalism.\n\nCohen assumes that Marx envisioned the abundance of a post-capitalist society\nbased on that of capitalist society, that is, the abundance of ‘private\nriches’ for all beyond natural scarcity. If this were the case, Marx’s claim\nwould be inconsistent with his demand in the _Grundrisse_ for the ‘stripping\naway’\n\nof the bourgeois form of wealth. It is much more consistent to assume that\nwhat needs to be overcome in a post-capitalist society is not scarcity as such\nbut the ‘objective conditions of socially specific _capital-accumulating\nscarcity_ ’\n\n(Mészáros 2012: 269; emphasis in original). Nevertheless, there is a certain\nambivalence in the _Grundrisse_ too, where Marx explicitly stated that the\n‘full development of human _mastery over the forces of nature_ , those of so-\ncalled nature as well as of humanity’s own nature’ ( _Grundrisse_ : 488;\nemphasis added).\n\nSuch a statement can be easily presented as strong proof of Marx’s naïve\nendorsement of bourgeois values, especially because he also praised the ‘great\ncivilising influence of capital’ ( _Grundrisse_ : 409).8\n\nHowever, as discussed in previous chapters, Marx’s treatment of nature became\nmore nuanced in the 1860s. With this ecosocialist understanding of _Capital_\nin mind, it is worth revisiting Cohen’s critique of Marx’s concept of\nabundance. As evidence of Marx’s productivist vision of abundance, Cohen\nrefers to the famous passage in his _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ , where\nhe wrote about the future communist society:\n\nIn a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of\nthe individual to the division of labour, and thereby also the antithesis\nbetween mental and physical labour, has vanished; after labour has become not\nonly a means of life but life’s prime want; after the productive forces have\nalso increased with the all-round development of the individual, and _all the\nsprings of common/co-operative/communal_\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 231\n\n_wealth_ [ _genossenschaftlicher Reichtum_] _flow more abundantly_ – only then\ncan the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and\nsociety inscribe on its banners: From each according to his abilities, to each\naccording to his needs! ( _MECW_ 24: 87; emphasis added) Cohen is not alone\nhere. Herman Daly (1991: 196) similarly argued that for Marx, the\n‘materialistic determinist, economic growth is crucial in order to provide the\noverwhelming material abundance that is the objective condition for the\nemergence of the new socialist man. Environmental limits on growth would\ncontradict “historical necessity”’. In fact, this passage from the _Critique\nof the Gotha Programme_ appears to be identical with Marx’s naïve endorsement\nof infinite wealth thanks to the development of productive forces and the\ncontinuation of the absolute domination over nature in the _Grundrisse._ It is\nno coincidence that ecosocialists such as Foster and Burkett do not refer to\nthis famous passage, although this is one of the rare cases where Marx\ndirectly discussed the future society.\n\nHowever, considering the ecosocialist background to Marx’s _Capital_ , it\nwould be inconsistent to read this passage as a celebration of productivist\ndomination over nature to achieve an abundance of wealth in the future\nsociety. In addition, Cohen’s attribution of left-wing libertarianism and its\nprinciple of self-ownership to Marx fails to explain why the latter thought\nthis abundance of wealth in communism could overcome ‘the narrow horizon of\nbourgeois right’.9 When Marx demanded that the metabolic exchange between\nhumans and nature should be regulated more rationally by freely associated\nproducers free from the pressure of capital accumulation, he did so precisely\nbecause he was aware of the fact that the universal metabolism of nature\nconsists of various biophysical processes that cannot be socially transcended\neven in socialism. The persistent existence of natural scarcity demands a more\nconscious regulation of social and natural wealth, even in a post-capitalist\nsociety.\n\nThus, it is not compelling to argue that Marx’s conception of ‘abundance’\n\ndemanded the satisfaction of all unlimited desires.10 It is also possible to\nimagine a different kind of abundance of wealth, that is, one founded upon the\nabundance of _common wealth_. Here one needs to recall the\n\n‘Lauderdale paradox’; the capitalist process of creating artificial scarcity.\n\nTranscendence of the artificial scarcity of private riches as the negation of\nthe negation requires the re-establishment of the abundance of common wealth,\nwhich is available to everyone without the mediation of monetary exchange.\n\nThe point is that this rehabilitation of communal abundance does not have to\nnegate natural scarcity.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Marx in this passage referred to the\n_genossenschaftlicher Reichtum_ as the form of post-capitalist abundance\nflowing https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n232 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ from its springs. He used this expression\nonly once, but its significance cannot be overestimated. This expression needs\nto be contrasted with the opening sentence of his _Critique of Political\nEconomy_(1859). Like _Capital_ , the _Critique of Political Economy_ starts\nwith an analysis of the commodity, where Marx wrote: ‘The bourgeois wealth [\n_der bürgerliche Reichtum_], at first sight, presents itself as an immense\naccumulation of commodities, its unit being a single commodity’ ( _MECW_ 29:\n269). Here Marx designated the commodity as the ‘bourgeois wealth’ that can be\ncontrasted with the postcapitalist wealth, i.e., ‘common wealth’ ( _der\ngenossenschaftliche Reichtum_) that does not appear as commodity. Common\nwealth is democratically managed by the associated producers and produced\naccording to their abilities as well as distributed according to their needs.\nThis is exactly how ‘individual property’ is rehabilitated based on ‘co-\noperative [ _genossenschaftliche_] production’ as discussed in the _Civil War\nin France_. Although Marx did not believe that it would be possible to produce\ninfinite amounts of wealth without any natural limit, he was convinced that\nonce capitalism is overcome there would be sufficient to feed everyone. In\nother words, abundance is not a technological threshold, but a social\nrelationship. This insight is fundamental to the abundance of common wealth to\nbe re-established beyond the artificial scarcity of ‘bourgeois wealth’.\n\nKristin Ross calls this kind of abundance of common wealth as ‘communal\nluxury’ by demanding the ‘end of the scarcity capitalism produces through\nwaste, hoarding, and privatization’ (Ross 2015: 127). Similarly, Jason Hickel\n(2019) names it ‘radical abundance’ because this form of abundance inherent to\ncommon wealth is _radically_ different from the bourgeois form of material\nwealth that is inevitably based on ever-increasing productivity and endless\nmass consumption of commodities. ‘Communal luxury’ and ‘radical abundance’\n\nare not equivalent to the unlimited access to abundant private properties in a\nconsumerist fashion; otherwise communist society would simply preserve the\nbourgeois form of private riches, contributing to the further degradation of\nthe natural environment. Since primitive accumulation created ‘artificial\nscarcity’, the ‘negation of the negation’ reverses the order of the Lauderdale\nparadox with the aim of recovering the ‘radical abundance’ of common wealth,\nmaking it equally accessible to everyone at the cost of private riches. In\nother words, the abundance of common wealth is about sharing and cooperating\nby distributing both wealth and burdens more equally and justly among members\nof the society. Only by recognizing this point can ‘the narrow horizon of\nbourgeois right be crossed in its entirety’.\n\nThe point is that unlike the left accelerationists discussed in Chapter 5\n\nwho place their hope for a post-scarcity society in unprecedented\ntechnological breakthroughs, Marx and other theorists of post-scarcity such as\nThomas More, https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 233\n\nÉtienne Cabet and Peter Kropotkin did not advocate the full-automation of\nproduction for the sake of the abolition of labour or emancipation from labour\n(Benanav 2020: 83). In this sense, Marx’s remark about the development of\nproductive forces in the _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ is not equivalent\nto the ‘mere’ increase of productivity because productive forces are both\nquantitative and qualitative. For example, in a higher phase of communism, the\nproductive forces of capital based on ‘the enslaving subordination of the\nindividual to the division of labour’ as well as ‘the antithesis between\nmental and physical labour’ – the separation of ‘conception’ and ‘execution’ –\nvanishes, so that labour becomes ‘life’s prime want’ as it becomes more\nattractive as an opportunity for ‘all-round development of the individual’.\nThis reorganization of the labour process may decrease productivity by\nabolishing the excessive division of labour and making labour more democratic\nand attractive, but it nonetheless counts as the ‘development’ of productive\nforces of social labour because it ensures the free and autonomous activity of\nindividual workers.\n\nBased upon this understanding, the famous declaration ‘From each according to\nhis abilities, to each according to his needs!’ can be interpreted in a non-\nproductivist manner too. Marx envisioned a society in which natural and social\ndifferences of abilities and talents among individuals do not appear as social\nand economic inequality but as individual uniqueness because they can be\ncompensated and supplemented by each other. What one person cannot do well –\nsomething that will always remain despite all-round development –\n\ncan be done by others, and you can help others with what you are good at.\n\nWhat everyone is not willing to do – unpleasant and boring work cannot be\nfully eradicated – can be shared by everyone more fairly. In this sense,\ncommunism does not impose conformity and uniformity upon everyone for the sake\nof equality, but it is about social organization and institutionalization that\naims to demolish the capitalist tie between differences in abilities and skill\nand economic inequality, as well as the imposition of unpleasant work on a\nparticular social group.\n\nThis alternative interpretation of the _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ from\nthe perspective of degrowth communism makes the meaning of the\n\n‘negation of the negation’ clear: de-enclosing and expanding the commons for\nthe sake of the many. Marx used the term ‘genossenschaftlich’ in order to\nsignify the future associated mode of production – in this case one can simply\ntranslate it as ‘co-operative’, but its meaning gradually shifts into the\narchaic type of _Markgenossenschaften_ – thus the term _genossenschaftlich_\nalso signifies ‘communal’. It is the rehabilitation of communal wealth in a\nhigher form without going back to the isolated small-scale production of\nprecapitalist communes. Rather, it presupposes socialized production under\ncapitalism, but with social planning and regulation to hinder infinite\neconomic growth and https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online\nby Cambridge University Press\n\n234 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ to decrease output in those branches that\ndrive extravagant consumption.\n\nInstead, the expansion of communal wealth through basic services and public\nspending will enable people to satisfy their basic needs without constantly\nseeking after a higher level of income by working longer hours and being\npromoted. In contrast, it lessens the pressure for endless competition and\nexpands the possibility of free choice outside the market.\n\nIn this way, it is possible to revisit Marx’s famous discussion in volume III\nof _Capital_ with regard to the distinction between the realms of ‘freedom’\nand\n\n‘necessity’:\n\nThis realm of natural necessity expands with his development, because his\nneeds do too; but the productive forces to satisfy these expand at the same\ntime. Freedom, in this sphere, can consist only in this, that socialized man,\nthe associated producers, govern the human metabolism with nature in a\nrational way, bringing it under their collective control instead of being\ndominated by it as a blind power; accomplishing it with the least expenditure\nof energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their human\nnature. But this always remains a realm of necessity. The true realm of\nfreedom, the development of human powers as an end in itself, begins beyond\nit, though it can only flourish with this realm of necessity as its basis. The\nreduction of the working day is the basic prerequisite. ( _Capital_ III: 959)\nLike the passage in the _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ , this has often\nbeen celebrated as an endorsement by Marx of the unlimited growth of\nproductive forces through full-automation and a provocation for absolute\ndomination over nature so that the realm of freedom can expand by reducing the\nworking day.\n\nAgain, such an interpretation is incompatible with the ecosocialist character\nof Marx’s _Capital_. From the perspective of radical abundance and degrowth\ncommunism, the expansion of the ‘realm of freedom’ need not solely depend on\never-increasing productive forces. Rather, once the artificial scarcity of\ncapitalism is overcome, people, now free from the constant pressure to earn\nmoney thanks to the expanding common wealth, would have an attractive choice\nto work less without worrying about the degradation of their quality of life.\nJason Hickel (2019: 66) nails down this point: ‘Liberated from the pressures\nof artificial scarcity, the compulsion for people to compete for ever-\nincreasing productivity would wither away. We would not have to feed our time\nand energy into the juggernaut of ever-increasing production, consumption and\necological destruction.’ Without the market competition and endless pressure\nfor capital accumulation, freely associated labour and cooperative production\ncould possibly reduce the working day to just three–\n\nsix hours. Only then will people have sufficient time for non-consumerist\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 235\n\nactivities such as leisure, exercise, study and love. In other words, it is\npossible to reduce the realm of necessity not by increasing the productive\nforces, but by rehabilitating communal luxury, which allows people to live\nmore stably without the pressure of being subjugated to the wage-labour\nsystem.\n\nDegrowth communism produces less not only to increase free time but also to\nsimultaneously lessen the burden on the natural environment. Certainly, the\nshortening of the working day is a precondition for the expansion of the realm\nof freedom, but the fairer (re)distribution of income and resources can also\nshorten the working day without the increase of productive forces.\n\nIn addition, by cutting down unnecessary production in branches such as\nadvertisement, marketing, consulting and finance, it would also be possible to\neliminate unnecessary labour and reduce excessive production as well as\nconsumption. Emancipated from the constant exposure to advertisement, planned\nobsolescence and ceaseless market competition, there would emerge more room to\nautonomously ‘self-limit’ production and consumption (Kallis 2020). When Marx\nargued that humans can organize their metabolic interaction with the\nenvironment in a conscious manner, it means that they can consciously reflect\nupon their social needs and limit them if necessary. This act of self-\nlimitation contributes to a conscious downscaling of the current ‘realm of\nnecessity’ which is actually full of _unnecessary_ things and activities from\nthe perspective of well-being and sustainability. They are only ‘necessary’\nfor capital accumulation and economic growth and not for the ‘all-round\ndevelopment of the individual’. Since capital drives us towards endless\nconsumption, especially in the face of ‘the _total absence_ of identifiable\n_self-limiting_ targets of productive pursuit admissible from the standpoint\nof capital’s mode of social metabolic reproduction’ (Mészáros 2012: 257;\nemphasis in original), self-limitation has a truly revolutionary potential.\n\nAt the same time, as Kate Soper (2020) argues, even if the current way of life\nbecame fully sustainable thanks to unprecedented technological development, it\nwould nonetheless not be a desirable world that could fully realize human\npotentialities and a good life. This is because of its constant pressure to\nengage in competitive work and consumption and its tendency to impoverish\nother opportunities for satisfying experiences and a more meaningful life\noutside the market. Post-capitalism needs to invent wholly different value-\nstandards and social behaviours, and a new sense of sufficiency and well-being\nneeds to replace the widespread aspiration to become upper-middle class.\nSoper’s call for ‘alternative hedonism’ in a post-growth society, however,\ndoes not mean austerity and poverty because it simultaneously aims to enrich\nvarious non-commercial activities that are not necessarily reflected in the\ngross domestic product (GDP). People will have different wants.\n\nInstead of wanting destructive, extravagant and wasteful products, people\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n236 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ will desire healthier, more solidaristic and\ndemocratic ways of living. In this way, _degrowth communism expands the ‘realm\nof freedom’ without depending on_ _an increase in productivity and even by\ndownscaling production_. This is how the\n\n‘negation of the negation’ reconstructs the radical abundance of ‘common\nwealth’ and increases the chances for free and sustainable human development\nwithout repeating the failures of really existing socialism in the 20th\ncentury.\n\n\n## **iv**\n\n**coMMoN labour as a way of rePairiNg the**\n\n\n## **Metabolic rift**\n\nMarx’s idea of degrowth communism is founded upon the radical abundance of\ncommunal wealth ( _genossenschaftlicher Reichtum_). It does not require\nunlimited growth because the abundance of common wealth can be multiplied by\nabolishing the artificial scarcity of the commodity and money and by sharing\nsocial and natural wealth with others. This offers an important insight for\nreconstructing how Marx after 1868 strove to find a way of repairing the\nmetabolic rift, which he characterized as ‘irreparable’ in volume III of\n_Capital_.\n\nCarl-Erich Vollgraf judges that Marx’s language here is haunted by an\n\n‘apocalyptic metaphor’ that leaves no space for the future optimism and that\nhe would not have used the same expression in the final manuscript if he were\nable to complete volume III (Vollgraf 2016: 130). Vollgraf ’s concern arises\nfrom the fact that, when reading _Capital_ , volume III, one cannot find\nMarx’s explanation about how ‘the freely associated producers’ would be able\nto\n\n‘govern the human metabolism with nature in a rational way, bringing it under\ntheir collective control instead of being dominated by it as a blind power’.\n\nMarx’s silence here signifies the incomplete character of _Capital_.\n\nUnder a productivist reading, the subsequent remark about ‘accomplishing\n\n[the regulation of human metabolism with nature] with the least expenditure of\nenergy’ ‘instead of being dominated by it as a blind power’ is understood as\nthe manipulation of natural phenomena through intensive and extensive usage of\ntechnologies. Of course, the rational regulation of natural law is essential\nfor the sake of successfully carrying out labour. However, one should also\nrecall that human metabolism with nature came to be dominated by a ‘blind\npower’\n\nnot only due to a lack of natural scientific knowledge but due to the reified\nsocial relations that exist under capitalism. For Marx, this is the main\nreason labour in capitalism cannot be carried out ‘in conditions most worthy\nand appropriate for their human nature’ even given today’s level of\ntechnology.

Seen from\nthis perspective, the human metabolism with nature under capitalism turns out\nto be irrational because it is far from satisfying social needs ‘with the\nleast expenditure of energy’. This is why as long as the dominance of this\nblind power of reified things persists, the metabolic rift will be\n‘irreparable’.\n\nHowever, the question remains as to why the conscious regulation of means of\nproduction and subsistence under socialism would realize a more rational\nmetabolic exchange with nature. This point is not necessarily clear in\n_Capital_ , and the sustainability of socialism cannot be taken for granted.\nIn fact, if a socialist society continues to raise its productive forces in\norder to satisfy all kinds of human needs, it would be a catastrophe for the\nenvironment. A more equal society is not automatically more sustainable. While\nthe earth has biophysical constrains, social demands are potentially\nlimitless. Marx thus came to admit that the principles of a steady-state\neconomy need to be rehabilitated in Western society. In this context, it is\nworth revisiting _Capital_ retrospectively from the standpoint of degrowth\ncommunism in order to envision a more sustainable future.11 There are at least\nfive reasons that communism increases the chance of repairing the metabolic\nrift compared with capitalist production.\n\nFirst, the aim of social production shifts from profit to use-values.\nCapitalist production continues to expand, endlessly seeking after the\nmaximization of profits. Capital is concerned about use-values only insofar as\nthey are required for selling products. Due to this marginalization of use-\nvalues, products that are not essential for social reproduction or that are\ndestructive of humans and the environment – for example, SUVs, fast fashion\nand industrial meat – are mass produced, as long as they sell well. At the\nsame time, goods and service that do not make a profit are under-produced, no\nmatter how essential they are. Marx’s point is that by abolishing the law of\nvalue, it becomes possible to shift the focus of social production to the\nproduction of higher use-values and their quality would be freed from the\nconstant pressure of infinite economic growth. It is true that in some sectors\nproduction must _improve_ (not _grow_) because some essential sectors are\ncurrently _under_ developed in capitalism.\n\nThis improvement requires reallocating money and resources to provide better\neducation, care work, art, sports and public transportation. These sectors,\nhowever, do not aim for unlimited growth, and in this sense they are already\nrealizing a stationary economy today – a university that grows at the rate of\n3 per cent per year would be absurd. The qualitative improvement of education,\nfor example, cannot be measured using GDP.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n238 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ Looked at from a different angle, these\nsectors are not fit to increase productivity.12 Much essential work cannot be\nfully automated but remains labour intensive. Consequently, it is often\ntreated as ‘unproductive’ compared with other industrial sectors that become\nmore and more capital intensive through mechanization. Unlike the industrial\nsectors whose production can double and triple with the introduction of new\nmachines, the productivity of care work such as nursing and teaching cannot\nincrease in the same manner.\n\nIn many cases, these caring sectors cannot increase productivity without\nsacrificing use-value and increasing the risk of incidents and maltreatment.\n\nThere are thus innate limits to the increase of productive forces imposed by\nthe nature of care work, this creates the problem known as ‘Baumol’s cost\ndisease’. The more society shifts towards essential work that produces basic\nuse-value, the slower the entire economy is likely to become.\n\nSecond, Marx stated in _Capital_ that the ‘reduction of the working day is the\nbasic prerequisite’ for the realm of freedom. However, no matter how much\ncapitalism develops productive forces, work hours did not decline during the\n20th and 21st centuries. On the contrary, the increasing number of precarious\nand low-paid jobs compels people to work longer hours. Mass production for the\nsake of capital valorization also increases non-essential jobs such as\nadvertising, marketing, finance and consulting. Marx wrote about such\nunnecessary jobs that inevitably increase with capitalist development: The\ncapitalist mode of production, while it enforces economy in each individual\nbusiness, also begets, by its anarchic system of competition, the most\noutrageous squandering of labour-power and of the social means of production,\nnot to mention the creation of a vast number of functions at present\nindispensable, but in themselves superfluous.\n\n( _Capital_ I: 667)\n\nBy reducing the production of non-essential goods that are produced simply for\nthe sake of profit-making, it is possible to significantly reduce unnecessary\nlabour. In other words, this reduction of ‘the realm of necessity’ and the\ncorresponding expansion of the ‘realm of freedom’ can occur by eliminating\nunnecessary labour and sharing the remaining work among everyone.\n\nThe paradox of capitalist production is that ‘necessary labour time’ that\ncorresponds to the reproduction of the labour power of individual workers is\nactually spent on producing an enormous collection of unnecessary products.\n\nIn other words, from the social and ecological standpoint, a large part of\nnecessary labour is already _unnecessary_ labour. This manifests in the\nwidespread phenomena of ‘bullshit jobs’ (Graeber 2018), that is, jobs that\neven workers themselves know are meaninglessness for society. Even if these\nmeaningless jobs are eliminated in socialism, this does not negatively affect\nthe prosperity https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 239\n\nof society and the well-being of its members because they were meaningless and\nunproductive of use-values from the beginning. Well-being can even improve\nbecause spending a large part of one’s life upon meaningless jobs is harmful\nfor mental health and these jobs also create meaningless products such as\nexcessive advertisements, intimidation lawsuits, and high-frequency trading.\nFurthermore, this kind of meaningless labour consumes a lot of energy and\nresources as well as the support of care workers. The elimination of bullshit\njobs would not only reduce social labour time but also immediately reduce\nenvironmental impacts without waiting for unrealistic technological\nadvancements in the future.\n\nCertainly, surplus labour and surplus products will remain necessary to some\nextent to safeguard against unexpected natural disasters, wars and famines.13\nHowever, once the aim of social production is emancipated from the pressure of\ninfinite capital accumulation, there is no need to produce an enormous and\neven wasteful amount of surplus products. The elimination of excessive surplus\nproducts is fully compatible with Marx’s insight into the steady-state\neconomy. This counts as ‘the basic prerequisite’ for the realm of freedom to\ntruly bloom in a post-scarcity economy. In fact, utopians of the post-scarcity\neconomy typically assume 15–25 hours work per week, but this does not\nnecessarily require full-automation of the labour process (Benanav 2020). On\nthe contrary, it is possible to realise such a post-work society by sharing\nessential work among all the members of society. However, this way of reducing\nwork hours is incompatible with the principle of profit-making and economic\ngrowth.\n\nThird, degrowth communism transforms the remaining realm of necessity in order\nto increase workers’ autonomy and make the content of work more attractive.\nThis transformation of work is essential because the realm of necessity\ninevitably remains in a post-revolutionary society. One need not be\npessimistic about the transhistorical necessity of labour. As seen above, Marx\nargued for abolishing ‘the enslaving subordination of the individual to the\ndivision of labour, and thereby also the antithesis between mental and\nphysical labour’, placing a high value on ‘the all-round development of the\nindividual’\n\nthrough labour.14 Labour becomes ‘life’s prime want’ ( _MECW_ 24: 87). Here\nMarx adopted a ‘more optimistic view’ of emancipatory labour (Klagge 1986:\n776). Through the real subsumption of labour under capital, cooperation and\nthe division of labour reinforce domination and discipline over workers. The\nincrease of productive forces under capitalism accelerates due to market\ncompetition only to establish the ‘despotism of capital’ ( _Capital_ I: 793).\nIn this context, the first step for degrowth communism is to abolish the\nexcessive division of labour that turns workers into a partial existence not\ncapable of https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n240 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ autonomously collaborating with others to\nproduce an entire product. Marx’s strategy for modifying work, when understood\nin a non-productivist manner, differs decisively from the emancipation of\nhumans from labour through full automation.15 In his opinion, the problem of\ncapitalist production is that labour lost its content due to the boring\nrepetition of simple tasks without any skill or autonomy, while full\nautomation can strengthen this tendency without making labour ‘life’s prime\nwant’. In order to end this alienation of work, Marx argued for abolishing\n‘the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour’. De-\ndivision of labour and the expulsion of those machines that deprive workers of\ntheir autonomy and independence in the labour process slows down the economy\nand creates more attractive work as the basis of individual self-\nrealization.16\n\nAlthough Marx focused on the need to secure ‘attractive work, the individual’s\nself-realization’ ( _Grundrisse_ : 611), this does not mean that labour\nbecomes ‘play’ even in a post-capitalist society, as Charles Fourier once\nadvocated. Indeed, Marx cautioned that this ‘in no way means that it becomes\nmere fun, mere amusement, as Fourier, with _grisette_ -like naivete, conceives\nit’.\n\nHe continued to argue that\n\n… really free working, e.g. composing, is at the same time precisely the most\ndamned seriousness, the most intense exertion. The work of material production\ncan achieve this character only (1) when its social character is posited, (2)\nwhen it is of a scientific and at the same time general character. (\n_Grundrisse_ : 611–12) Marx acknowledged that certain kinds of labour continue\nto exist in postcapitalism and cause suffering and pain as they are boring and\ntiresome.\n\nThese kinds of work need to be reduced with the aid of new technologies.\n\nAlternatively, a just society needs to fairly allocate dirty or unpleasant\ntasks through work rotations instead of imposing them on those with less\npower.17\n\nIf excessive division of labour is replaced by fairer rotation of work and\nequal distribution of collaborative work, this protection of the ‘general\ncharacter’ of labour is likely to slow the production process, but this is\nwelcome in degrowth communism.\n\nFourth, the abolition of market competition for profits in degrowth communism\nalso deaccelerates the economy:\n\nin the absence of market compulsions, it is more likely that the realm of\nnecessity would change slowly, by adapting innovations from the realm of\nfreedom. The practical implementation of those innovations might take a long\ntime, since the rush to implement changes in process would no longer be\nenforced by market competition, but instead would need to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 241\n\nbe decided through coordination among various committees. (Benanav 2020: 92)\n\nIn this vein, Aaron Benanav also recognizes that there will be ‘no built-in\ngrowth trajectory’ in such a post-capitalist system.18\n\nFinally, what Marx demanded as the abolition of the ‘antithesis between mental\nand physical labour’ in the _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ is of great\nsignificance. This transcendence of the antithesis should not be confused with\nthe de-division between material labour and immaterial labour. Marx’s usage of\nmental and physical labour rather corresponds to Harry Braverman’s concepts of\n‘conception’ and ‘execution’ respectively (Braverman 1998). The problem of the\ndespotism of capital lies in the total deprivation of workers’\n\nsubjective power of ‘conception’, so that they are subordinated to the command\nof capital that decides what, how and how much they produce independently of\ntheir will and desires. As a result of the real subsumption, workers simply\nexecute according to the imperative and command of capital. By contrast, the\nreunification of conception and execution requires establishing substantive\nequality in the production process among producers beyond their formal\nequality within market exchange. Marx wrote about communal production from\nthis perspective:\n\nThe communal character of production would make the product into a communal,\ngeneral product from the outset. The exchange which originally takes place in\nproduction – which _would not be an exchange_ _of exchange values but of\nactivities_ , – determined by _communal needs and_ _communal purposes_ – would\nfrom the outset include the participation of the individuals in the communal\nworld of products. ( _Grundrisse_ : 171; emphasis in original)\n\nThe key here is the active participation of workers in deciding what, how and\nhow much they produce. This democratic production is the direct antithesis of\nthe ‘despotic’ character of capitalist production. Associated producers more\nactively participate in the decision-making process without the imposition of\nthe will of the few. Hierarchal control is incompatible with Marx’s vision of\nproviding more autonomy to the associated producers, but without hierarchy, it\ntakes more time to mediate between different opinions and reach a consensus.\nSince the increase of productive forces under capitalism relies upon the\nundemocratic and top-down character of the production process with the\nconcentration of power in the hands of the few, democratic decision-making in\nthe workplace inevitably slows down the entire process of production. The USSR\nwas not able to accept this and imposed bureaucratic control upon social\nproduction. Through collective decision-making processes, workers have more\nroom to reflect upon the necessity of their products, egalitarian\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n242 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ relations of class, gender and race, and\nenvironmental impacts. Thus, Giorgos Kallis (2017: 12) concludes: ‘Genuine\ndemocratic socialism cannot grow at the pace of capitalism, which sidelines\nand destroys what slows it down.’\n\nTaking into account these five transformations that Marx demanded as\nconditions of socialism, one may wonder how they could be achieved without\ndegrowth. They also help explain why degrowth communism is more likely to\nrepair the metabolic rift than capitalism. Furthermore, economic growth does\nnot become green simply because it occurs in socialism. As long as economic\ngrowth is founded upon the biophysical process of production and consumption,\ngrowth is not sustainable after a certain point _in any society._ In other\nwords, Marx’s ecosocialism needs to be specified as a degrowth one, and this\nis the conclusion that Marx arrived at after seriously studying natural\nsciences and pre-capitalist societies after 1868.\n\nIt should be clear by now that socialism promotes a social transition to a\ndegrowth economy. The regulation of capital’s reckless attempt to valorize\nitself creates a greater chance of reducing the working day and thus the\nenvironmental impact. More autonomy for workers who are free from the market\ncompetition also gives them opportunities to reflect on the meaning of work\nand consumption. Social planning is indispensable to banning excessive and\ndirty production and to staying within planetary boundaries while satisfying\nbasic social needs. These transformations reinforce the possibility of slowing\ndown and scaling down the economy in order to create a more sustainable and\negalitarian economy. Although it was never recognized during the 20th century,\nMarx’s idea of degrowth communism is more important than ever today because it\nincreases the chance of human survival in the Anthropocene.\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also demonstrated the possibility of pulling an\nemergency brake on economic activities for the sake of protecting human lives.\n\nThe obvious problem was that it created serious disturbances under an economic\nsystem that presupposes constant economic growth.\n\n2\n\nLatouche (2006) used to characterize degrowth in this way. In addition, Herman\nE. Daly (1992) is far from endorsing Marx’s socialism as discussed below. The\nshift in tone can be also found in Tim Jackson (2021), although he is far from\nendorsing socialism or communism.\n\n3\n\nHarvey (2004) expands Marx’s concept of primitive accumulation to an analysis\nof neoliberalism as ‘accumulation by dispossession’. While Harvey focuses on\nthe political project of taking wealth from the working class for the\ncapitalist class, the problem of nature remains largely absent (see Chapter\n4).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_The Abundance of Wealth in Degrowth Communism_ | 243\n\n4 This is Marx’s consistent standpoint since the _Economic and Philosophical_\n_Manuscripts_ of 1844 (see Saito 2017).\n\n5\n\nThe ‘unprotected’ ( _vogelfrei_) proletariat did not automatically become\ndiligent workers. It took a long time to subjugate them to the command of\ncapital with punishment and discipline. In this sense, primitive accumulation\nis not a one-time process but must be repeated. Yet, once the regime of\ncapital is firmly established, the situation looks quite favourable for it.\nSince their objective existence was basically secured, slaves and serfs worked\nonly out of fear under direct personal domination, while workers in capitalist\nsociety work ‘freely’, which make them more productive in spite of the absence\nof such an external threat of physical violence:\n\nIn comparison with that of the slave, this work is more productive, because\nmore intensive and more continuous, for the slave only works under the impulse\nof external fear, but not for his own existence, which does not belong to him;\nthe free worker, in contrast, is driven on by his own WANTS. The consciousness\nof free self-determination – of freedom – makes the latter a much better\nworker than the former, and similarly the feeling of RESPONSIBILITY. ( _MECW_\n34: 98–9; emphasis in original)\n\n6\n\nThe contrast of wage labour with slavery should not eliminate the similarity\nbetween them. Marx used the expression ‘wage slavery’ to highlight this point.\n\nIn one passage, he even argues that the system of wage-labour is nothing but\n\n‘veiled slavery’:\n\nWhile the cotton industry introduced child-slavery into England, in the United\nStates it gave the impulse for the transformation of the earlier, more or less\npatriarchal slavery into a system of commercial exploitation.\n\nIn fact the veiled slavery of the wage labourers in Europe needed the\nunqualified slavery of the New World as its pedestal. ( _Capital_ I: 925) 7\n\nMarx did not fully distinguish between private property and individual\nproperty in the second edition of _Capital_ as individual property appears in\nchapter 25\n\nin an utterly different sense ( _MEGA_ II/6: 685). In the French edition of\n1875, Marx thus corrected that to ‘private property’ ( _MEGA_ II/7: 682).\nEngels did not reflect this modification in the third German edition. This\nimplies that Engels was not as sensitive as Marx about the difference between\nthese concepts.\n\n8\n\nWhereas John Bellamy Foster (2008: 96) highlighted the existence of Marx’s\necological critique of capitalism in the _Grundrisse_ , it is not necessarily\nclear in my opinion whether Marx was fully ecologically conscious at that\ntime. It is relatively easy to find productivist statements in the\n_Grundrisse_.\n\n9 The characterization of ‘left-wing libertarianism’ is also incompatible with\nMarx’s intensive engagement with precapitalist communes after 1868.\n\n10 It is helpful to recall that Ernest Mandel (1992: 206) defined ‘abundance’\nas\n\n‘saturation of demand’. He continues to argue that ‘a large number of goods\nalready fall into this category in the richer countries – not only for\nmillionaires but for the mass of the population’. Abundance already exists,\nbut it cannot be felt as such under capitalism.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n244 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ 11 The abolition of the reified power of\ncapital alone does not guarantee the realization of sustainable production\nbecause production is a material process, and burning fossil fuel means the\nsame for the climate whether that happens in capitalism or socialism. The\npoint is that non-capitalist society expands the room for more conscious\ncontrol of production and consumption once freed from the endless competition\nand endless accumulation of capital.\n\n12 This is the main reason why these sectors inevitably remain underdeveloped\nin capitalism and are characterized by low wages and long working hours.\n\n13 Thus, Marx highlighted that surplus labour and surplus products always\nexisted in any society. However, only under capitalism are they extended\nalmost infinitely.\n\n14 ‘Labour’ needs to include reproductive labour. It should not be reduced to\nthe capitalist category of wage labour.\n\n15 The position put forward here is different from the abolition of abstract\nlabour (Postone 1996). Considering its material character, abstract labour is\nnot peculiar to the capitalist mode of production, and it cannot be abolished,\nalthough value can be transcended with private labour. Both concrete labour\nand abstract labour remain in the post-capitalist society, but the persistence\nof abstract labour does not result in domination by real abstraction because\nvalue is no longer the organizing principle of social reproduction.\n\n16 Thus, the slowing down of the economy in favour of the autonomy of everyone\nin the production process poses a limitation to shortening of work hours.\n\nThis makes it all the more important to transform the content of labour into\nan attractive one. At the same time, it does not exclude the possibility of\nintroducing new technologies that will allow everyone to work more freely and\nautonomously.\n\n17 Another way of allocating work is a different way of renumeration. In\ncapitalism, high-skilled labour is often characterized by high income, which\ncreates economic inequality. In degrowth communism these jobs will be\nrenumerated with shorter working hours, and not with a higher salary.\n\n18 One should add that this course of trajectory is not inevitable in a\ndegrowth economy. One can imagine that freely associated producers can come up\nwith more innovative and original ideas once freed from the constant pressure\nof profit-making. For example, researchers in academic institutions are not\ndriven by profit-making, but their motivation comes from intellectual\ncuriosity and joy, leading to some epoch-making discoveries.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.008 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nJoseph Schumpeter (1951: 293) once said, ‘Capitalism is a process, a\nstationary capitalism would be a contradictio in adjecto.’ Degrowth is\nincompatible with capitalism, and it is essentially an anti-capitalist\nproject. However, there has been little intellectual dialogue between degrowth\nand Marxism in the past mainly because of the latter’s alleged Prometheanism.\nThis needs to change, and, fortunately, it has already started to change with\nadvocacy for an\n\n‘ecosocialist degrowth’ (Löwy et al. 2022). This situation reflects the\ntheoretical and practical progress of political ecology in the last two\ndecades.\n\nToday, the existence of Marx’s ecology has become undeniable thanks to recent\nrobust attempts by Marxian scholars to critically comprehend the historical\ndynamics of capital accumulation and its contradictions from an ecological\nperspective, especially by those ecosocialists who employ the concept of\n‘metabolic rift’. This concept opened up a space of critical engagements with\nother traditions of environmentalism and political ecology, including\ndegrowth. In this context, the recent renaissance of degrowth theory provides\na great opportunity to re-examine and update Marx’s vision of a post-scarcity\neconomy. Also inspired by new findings from the _MEGA_ , this book attempted\nto decisively liberate Marxism from productivist ‘socialism’ by reinterpreting\nthe late Marx as a ‘degrowth communist’.\n\nThe positive elaboration of Marx’s vision of post-capitalist society in this\nbook is also an attempt to respond to those who doubt the fruitfulness of\ninvestigating Marx’s ecology in his notebooks. It is true that the existence\nof Marx’s ecology alone does not necessarily mean that his insights are useful\ntoday nor justify the need to engage with his political economy. Thus, critics\nexpress concerns about whether Marx’s ecology can be applied to the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.009 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n246 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ contemporary world because the economic and\necological situation in the 21st century is wholly different from his time,\nand the level of scientific knowledge is incomparable. Others object that such\na ‘greening’ of Marx’s critique of capitalism is a mere imposition of ‘our’\nconcerns upon Marx’s text, distorting and neglecting the deep flaws and\nlimitations in Marx’s theory. Due to the ‘obsolescence’ of Marx’s theory,\ncritics even conclude that ‘Marxism has become so theoretically marginal that\nhopes for an “ecological Marx” are now best regarded as illusory’ (Boggs 2020:\n83).\n\nIndeed, Marx was not always consistent but ambivalent in a number of points.\nThis ought not to be a surprise. His ideas were inevitably limited by his own\npersonal experiences as well as the social and economic structure and dominant\nvalue-standards and norms of Western Europe in the 19th century.\n\nOne can thus find productivist and Eurocentric remarks in his writings and\ncriticize them, but it would be reductionistic to reject his entire\ntheoretical contribution because of some isolated remarks without sufficiently\nconsidering their historical, theoretical and political contexts and Marx’s\nintentions. This reductionism is especially problematic because Marx often\nreflected upon his earlier flawed assumptions and developed more sophisticated\nviews.\n\nAs I discussed throughout the book, he clearly corrected his own earlier\nproductivist and Eurocentric positions after the 1860s. By carefully tracing\nMarx’s theoretical development during his life, it is possible to avoid\ninfertile polemics based on either dogmatically defending the correctness of\nMarx’s theory or blindly denying its usefulness by overgeneralizing the\nimmature views of the young Marx. While the former attitude is obviously\ninadequate, the latter rejection is unfortunate because Marx is clearly one of\nthe few theorists to have developed a systematic critique of the capitalist\nsystem.\n\nBy negating his intellectual legacy too hastily, it becomes increasingly hard\nto criticize capitalism, especially when endless capital accumulation is the\nobvious cause of today’s environmental crisis. This reproduces and reinforces\n\n‘capitalist realism’.\n\nOne should note that digging into unpublished writings of Karl Marx through\nthe _MEGA_ is _not_ yet another attempt to deify his omnipotent worldview that\nperfectly predicted the environmental catastrophe in the Anthropocene. At the\nsame time, my extensive investigation of Marx’s notebooks in my earlier work,\n_Karl Marx’s Ecosocialism: Capital, Nature and_ _the Unfinished Critique of\nPolitical Economy_ , did not aim to save Marx by demonstrating the ‘mere’ fact\nthat he was interested in ecological issues. Such a philological quibble would\nonly be relevant to Marxian scholars who wish to defend Marx’s _Capital_ as a\nbible. The discussion in the current book should once again make it clear that\nMarx’s project of political economy essentially remains unfinished, and\n_Capital_ did not explain everything.1\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.009 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n_Conclusion_ | 247\n\nEven if Marx’s ecological project cannot be directly applied to today’s\nsituation in the Anthropocene, his notebooks offer useful hints that enable us\nto speculate how Marx would have developed his critique further if he were\nable to integrate recent scientific findings into his critique of political\neconomy. This is the task that today’s Marxists are expected to fulfil because\n_it_ _offers a wholly new vision of post-capitalism_ after the collapse of the\nUSSR. In this sense, _Karl Marx’s Ecosocialism_ was a preparation for _going\nbeyond Capital_ in order to open up new dialogues with other currents of\nenvironmentalism in the Anthropocene and to more concretely envision a post-\ncapitalist future.\n\nYet, going beyond _Capital_ is not equivalent to denying it. Marx’s ecological\ncritique of capitalism in _Capital_ provides an indispensable methodological\nfoundation for a critical understanding of capitalist ecological destruction.\n\nWith this methodology, more recent scientific discoveries on the Earth system,\nsoil and marine ecology, and climate change can be used to supplement Marx’s\necosocialist critique of capitalism. This will substantiate the idea of\ndegrowth communism further.\n\nUnfortunately, Marx did not elaborate on the idea of degrowth communism. Until\nhis death, he was struggling with various theoretical inconsistencies and\nlimitations, especially those having to do with the development of productive\nforces. After all, he was not able to fully correct and expand his earlier\narguments in volumes II and III of _Capital_ in the 1870s, which sometimes\nleaves the impression that he remained a productivist and Eurocentric thinker.\nThat negative impression multiplied after his death partly because even\nEngels, the founder of Marxism, was not able to fully understand what Marx was\nseeking beyond _Capital_. This is not meant to negate Engels’s great\nachievements in the history of Marxism. Without Engels’s reassembling of\nMarx’s theory, the enormous success of Marxism in the 20th century would have\nbeen impossible.\n\nNonetheless, the reason for Engels’s success largely owes to his\n\n‘simplification’ of Marx’s theory in addition to his own sharp analyses of\nconcrete social and political events. Engels recognized that the extensive\nscope of Marx’s project went far beyond the short-sighted interests of the\nworking class, which would make the wide reception of Marx’s theory among\nworkers difficult. The essence of Engels’s theoretical endeavour is thus not a\nsimple\n\n‘deformation’ of Marx’s theory based on an insufficient understanding, but\nrather an intentional ‘reconstruction’ of its key elements in a way that was\nadjustable to and compatible with socialist and workers’ movements in his\ntime. ‘Marxism’ for Engels provided a comprehensive intellectual orientation\nfor the working class as a counter-ideology against the main capitalist\nideology of modernization. In this attempt, however, Engels ended up\noveremphasizing https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.009 Published online by\nCambridge University Press\n\n248 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ some aspects of Marx’s theory, such as\n‘rationalism’, ‘positivism’, ‘progressive view of history’, ‘productivism’ and\n‘Eurocentrism’.\n\nInsofar as the secret of Engels’s success was based on his uncritical\nappraisal of the modernization process, ‘Marxism’ was not able to provide the\ntheoretical scope necessary to truly go beyond modern capitalist society. As\nImmanuel Wallerstein (1979) pointed out, Marxism in the ‘centres’ of the\ncapitalist world-system turned into social democracy that demands reforms of\nthe capitalist economy and representative democracy. In the ‘semi-peripheries’\n\nand ‘peripheries’ where socialist revolutions succeeded, Wallerstein argued,\nMarxism functioned as an ideology that legitimized industrialization and\nmodernization in the form of un-democratic ‘state capitalism’.2 As a result,\nthe ‘actually existing socialist countries’ remained trapped within the global\ncapitalist system of sovereign states.\n\nIt is in this sense that Engels’s theoretical intervention – more or less\nlegitimately – came to be regarded as responsible for the political\ndogmatization of ‘Marxism’ as well as for ‘deformation’ of Marx’s theory.\nAlthough Engels shared many views with Marx, there were theoretical\ndifferences between them. This is not surprising as they were two different\npeople after all. Engels’s philosophical project was not quite compatible with\nMarx’s late theoretical endeavours. This is why distinguishing Marx and Engels\nis an indispensable condition for going beyond _Capital_.\n\nAs discussed in this volume, it is worth revisiting Georg Lukács in this\ncontext as he criticized Engels already in the 1920s and contributed to the\nformation of Western Marxism. Even though his critique of Engels caused grave\nmisunderstandings due to his careless formulation and ended up being\ncriticized for inconsistencies and ambivalences by other Marxists, Lukács,\nunlike the later Western Marxists, integrated Marx’s concept of\n\n‘metabolism’. He successfully developed a Marxian methodology to thematize the\ntense relationship between humans and nature under capitalism.\n\nLukács’s ‘methodological dualism’ – not ‘ontological dualism’ – elaborated in\n_Tailism_ _and the Dialectic_ , is loyal to Marx’s own method of political\neconomy.\n\nHis Hegelian concept of the ‘identity of identity and non-identity’ also makes\nan essential contribution to critically comprehending the historical dynamics\nof capital accumulation and its limits even in the Anthropocene.\n\nMarx’s dualist methodology is of great significance in the Anthropocene as it\nopens up an alternative to the recent popular discourse on post-Cartesian\nontology between humans and nature. Various forms of dualism are certainly\ninadequate to respond to the multi-stranded crisis of the Anthropocene, a\ncrisis characterized by the entanglement of the natural and the social.\nHowever, flat ontologies or other forms of monism are not the only\nalternatives to Cartesian dualism. Since the analytical distinction between\nsociety and nature does not https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.009\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\n_Conclusion_ | 249\n\nnecessarily mean Cartesian dualism, many monist critiques of the Cartesian\ndualism often attributed to Marxism are strawmen in that they exclude the\npossibilities of more productive ‘dualist’ approaches a priori. Jason W. Moore\nemploys such a strawman argument against the metabolic rift approach, but\nMarx’s methodological dualism is founded upon his unique conception of\n\n‘material’ ( _Stoff_) and ‘form’ ( _Form_), which is essential to grasp the\nhistorical particularity of capitalist production and its contradiction with\nthe material conditions for sustainable production. The social and the natural\nare deeply intertwined in reality, and pristine nature does not exist anymore,\nbut it is nonetheless necessary to distinguish between the social and the\nnatural _analytically._\n\nWhile Alf Hornborg and Andreas Malm have already defended the validity of such\nanalytical dualism against Bruno Latour and Moore, the current book also aims\nto go further by demonstrating that Marx’s methodological dualism has\ntheoretical consequences for his vision of post-capitalism.3 In contrast to\nthe recent revival of post-capitalism based on the _Grundrisse_ , which is\nstill haunted by productivist attitudes under the name of the stewardship of\nthe earth, Marx actually changed his understanding of productive forces of\ncapital in the beginning of the 1860s in a manner that is consistent with his\nmethodological dualism. By paying attention to the intertwined character of\nform and matter, the late Marx became aware of the likelihood that the\nannihilation of productive forces of capital will result in the decrease of\nsocial productivity for the sake of more autonomous and sustainable production\nin democratic socialism. This awareness represents a clear contrast to the\nleft accelerationism based on full automation, and it offers a wholly new\nvision of post-capitalism. For Marx in the 1870s, a post-scarcity society need\nnot be grounded upon technocratic development of productive forces. The\nabundance of ‘common/communal wealth’ ( _der genossenschaftliche Reichtum_)\nthat appears in his _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ enables to integrate\ndegrowth into a Marxian vision of post-capitalist society, although such a\npossibility was completely neglected for such a long time. In this vein, I\nrevisited _Capital_ in the final chapter in order to truly go beyond it by\nexplicating why Marx’s vision of degrowth communism can increase the chance of\nestablishing a more equal and sustainable society beyond capital’s regime of\ninfinite economic growth at the cost of our invaluable planet.\n\nAdmitting the current political unpopularity of ‘degrowth communism’, the term\nintends to highlight differences not only from the increasingly popular vision\nof green capitalism but also from technocratic ecosocialism.\n\nEcosocialism, like green capitalism, can be growth driven, but it will not be\nsustainable. Degrowth communism as a variant of ecosocialism aims for a post-\nscarcity society without economic growth. It aims to rehabilitate the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.009 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n250 _| Marx in the Anthropocene_ abundance of common wealth against the\nartificial scarcity created by capital.\n\nIf so, Marxism needs to be thoroughly reinterpreted from this standpoint of\n\n‘ecosocialist degrowth’ without negating Marx’s theory of value, reification,\nclass and socialism. This bold renewal of Marx’s post-capitalism after the\ncollapse of the USSR is indispensable in order to enrich dialogues with non-\nMarxian environmentalism and to envision the possibility of human survival in\nthe Anthropocene. Whether the political project of degrowth communism will\ninevitably remain ‘illusory’ will be judged by history.\n\n\n## **Notes**\n\n### 1\n\nThe impression that Marx’s ecology depends excessively on the outdated science\nof the 19th century is the result of a one-sided focus on his reception of\nJustus von Liebig in _Capital_. However, it is not necessary to absolutize\nLiebig’s critique of the robbery system of agriculture. Marx corrected his\novervaluation of Liebig’s critique of robbery agriculture in the second\nedition of _Capital_ (Saito 2017).\n\n2\n\nThe same point was recently put forward by Branko Milanović (2019) about\nChina. In this sense, what he discusses as ‘political capitalism’ is nothing\nnew to Marxism.\n\n3\n\nNow Hornborg (2020) also argues for degrowth, but his vision of a\npostcapitalist future remains abstract. Malm (2021) remains silent with regard\nto this point.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108933544.009 Published online by Cambridge\nUniversity Press\n\n**References**\n\nAdamiak, Richard. 1974. ‘Marx, Engels and Dühring’. _Journal of the History of\nIdeas_ 35 (1): 98–112.\n\nAdorno, Theodor W.

You have a win to world!\n\n—The Cyborg International\n\nDisparate times call for disparate methods. Let’s just say that this is the\nend of pre-history, this moment when planetary constraints start really coming\nto bear on the ever-expanding universe of the commodification of everything.\nThis is the worldview-changing realization that some now call the\n_Anthropocene_. Let’s not despair. Some of the greatest accelerations in the\nlife of our species-being have happened in moments of limit, if never before\non such a scale.\n\nThe Anthropocene is the name Paul Crutzen and others give to this period of\ngeological time upon which the planet has entered. Crutzen:\n\n> About 30–50 percent of the planet’s land surface is exploited by humans …\n> More than half of all accessible fresh water is used by mankind. Fisheries\n> remove more than 25 percent of the primary production in upwelling ocean\n> regions … Energy use has grown sixteen-fold during the twentieth century …\n> More nitrogen fertilizer is applied in agriculture than is fixed naturally\n> in all terrestrial ecosystems.[1](part0015.html#preft-1)\n\nIt’s not the end of the world, but it is the end of pre-history. It is time to\nannounce in the marketplace of social media that the God who still hid in the\nworldview of an ecology that was self-correcting, self-balancing and self-\nhealing—is dead. “The Anthropocene represents a new phase in the history of\nthe Earth, when natural forces and human forces became intertwined, so that\nthe fate of one determines the fate of the other. Geologically, this is a\nremarkable episode in the history of the planet.”[2](part0015.html#preft-2)\nThe human is no longer that figure in the foreground which pursues its self-\ninterest against the background of a wholistic, organicist cycle that the\nhuman might perturb but with which it can remain in balance and harmony, in\nthe end, by simply _withdrawing_ from certain excesses.\n\nThis is not the end of pre-history that the main currents of critical theory\nthought they would encounter. So perhaps we need some new critical theory. Or\nnew-old, for it turns out that there was a powerful and original current of\nthought that was all but snuffed out in a previous, failed attempt to end pre-\nhistory. There may even be more than one. But the one I offer here in the\nfirst part of this book, “Labor and Nature,” bears the names of two Russian\nMarxist writers, Alexander Bogdanov and Andrey Platonov.\n\nOnce we are equipped with this preterite thought, we can set it to work. In\nthe second part, “Science and Utopia,” we move from the cold and hunger of\nearly Soviet Russia to the sunshine and plenty of California at the end of the\ntwentieth century. The feminist science studies scholar Donna Haraway and the\nscience fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson are avatars of two approaches to\nthinking and writing at the end of this pre-history that echo and update\nBogdanov and Platonov for our self-consciously Anthropocene times.\n\nCommon sense has it that the Cold War is over, that the Soviet Union lost and\nthe United States won. While some would wish to hibernate in some “psychic\nsoviet,” the dominant mood is that regnant American-style capitalism won a\nglobal victory. The historic arc of _Molecular Red_ is different. In this\nversion, the collapse of the Soviet system merely prefigures the collapse of\nthe American one. While the ruins of the first are real and poignant, the\nruins of the latter have not quite been apprehended for what they\nare.[3](part0015.html#preft-3)\n\nA traveler among the antique ruins comes across the shattered visor of a\nrusting ship, half sunk in sand. Round the decay of this colossal wreck\nnothing beside remains; only desperation, boundless and bare. The name of this\nvessel has peeled off, but it might as well be named after Ozymandias, the\nfabled Egyptian king of Shelley’s poem, and his challenge “Look on my works,\nye Mighty, and despair!”\n\nBeyond this rusting hull lies innumerable others. This is a modern ruin, mass-\nproduced. And it is not just sand or time that ruined it. This dusted Martian\nlandscape is one of the Seven Wonders of the World in negative. The vast and\nnow gone waters that these ships once plied was the Aral Sea, which is less\nthan a tenth of its former size.[4](part0015.html#preft-4)\n\nThere were once pharaoh-sized statues here too. The Aral Sea is in what was\nonce the Soviet Union, so perhaps the statues were of Lenin, pointing to a\nfuture rather remote from this one. But the ship itself is a wreck that\nrecalls a power of a different kind: the capricious stubbornness of the\nnatural world.\n\nCotton-growing actually began in this region when the American Civil War cut\noff Russia’s cotton supply. After the revolution, Soviet engineers tapped the\nAmu Darya River that flowed into the Aral Sea as a water source for a cotton\nindustry. The Soviets greatly expanded cotton production as an export crop\nafter World War Two, and built vast irrigation projects to this end. Enormous\nquantities of water were an input, mixed with soil and seed and fertilizer, to\ngrow cotton plants. The engineers knew the Aral Sea would disappear. Its\nfishing fleet was collateral damage, and so too perhaps were the many species\nof plant and animal now fossilizing here.\n\nThis is an example of what, after Marx, we might call _metabolic\nrift_.[5](part0015.html#preft-5) Labor pounds and wheedles rocks and soil,\nplants and animals, extracting the molecular flows out of which our shared\nlife is made and remade. But those molecular flows do not return from whence\nthey came. The waters diverted from the Aral Sea to the cotton fields did not\ncome back. As Marx knew, agriculture is a maker of deserts.\n\nMarx’s example of metabolic rift was the way nineteenth-century English\nfarming extracted nutrients such as nitrates from the soil, which growing\nplants absorbed, which farmers harvested as crops, which workers in the cities\nate to fuel their industrious labors, and who would then shit and piss the\nwaste products out of their private metabolisms. Those waste products,\nincluding the nitrates, flow through run-off and sewers and pour out to sea.\nWhole industries for making artificial fertilizer would arise to address this\nrift—in turn causing further metabolic rifts\nelsewhere.[6](part0015.html#preft-6)\n\nThe Anthropocene is a series of metabolic rifts, where one molecule after\nanother is extracted by labor and technique to make things for humans, but the\nwaste products don’t return so that the cycle can renew itself. The soils\ndeplete, the seas recede, the climate alters, the gyre widens: a world on\nfire. Earth, water, air: there is a metabolic rift where the molecules that\nare out of joint are potassium nitrate, as in Marx’s farming example; or where\nthey are dihydrogen-oxide as with the Aral sea; or where they are carbon\ndioxide, as in our current climate change scenario.\n\nIt used to seem as if exhausting the soil here or diverting water there were\nlocal problems. The Anthropocene is the recognition that some metabolic rifts\nare global in scope.[7](part0015.html#preft-7) Nitrogen and carbon are on\nvacation from their old routines. Climate change already appears to be\naffecting the global distribution of water in profound ways. The Aral Sea\nexperience of Soviet times is a microcosm of our now global experiment in\nmetabolic rift. The draining of the Aral Sea was a kind of terraforming in\nreverse, making Earth into a Martian desert rather than Martian deserts into a\nnew Earth.[8](part0015.html#preft-8)\n\nMarx: “All that is solid melts into air.”[9](part0015.html#preft-9) That\neffervescent phrase suggests something different now. Of all the liberation\nmovements of the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, one succeeded\nwithout limit. It did not liberate a nation, or a class, or a colony, or a\ngender, or a sexuality. What it freed was not the animals, and still less the\ncyborgs, although it was far from human. What it freed was chemical, an\nelement: carbon. A central theme of the Anthropocene was and remains the story\nof the Carbon Liberation Front.\n\nThe Carbon Liberation Front seeks out all of past life that took the form of\nfossilized carbon, unearths it and burns it to release its energy. The\nAnthropocene runs on carbon.[10](part0015.html#preft-10) It is a\nredistribution, not of wealth, or power, or recognition, but of molecules.\nReleased into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, these molecules trap heat,\nthey change climates. The end of pre-history appears on the horizon as carbon\nbound within the earth becomes scarce, and liberated carbon pushes the climate\ninto the red zone.[11](part0015.html#preft-11)\n\nPowerful interests still deny the existence of the Carbon Liberation\nFront.[12](part0015.html#preft-12) Those authorities attentive to the evidence\nof this metabolic rift usually imagine four ways of mitigating its effects.\nOne is that the market will take care of everything. Another proposes that all\nwe need is new technology. A third imagines a social change in which we all\nbecome individually accountable for quantifying and limiting our own carbon\n“footprint.” A fourth is a romantic turn away from the modern, from\ntechnology, as if the rift is made whole when a privileged few shop at the\nfarmer’s market for artisanal cheese.[13](part0015.html#preft-13) None of\nthese four solutions seems quite the thing.\n\nThe first task of critique is to point out the poverty of these\noptions.[14](part0015.html#preft-14) A second task might be to create the\nspace within which very different kinds of knowledge and practice might meet.\nEconomic, technical, political, and cultural transformations are all\nadvisable, but at least part of the problem is their relation to each other.\nThe liberation of carbon transforms the totality within which each of these\nspecific modes of thinking and being could be practiced. That calls for new\nways of organizing knowledge.\n\nHegel, that great systematizer of knowledge, thought the French Revolution was\na world-historical moment, but from our vantage point in time he was\nmistaken.[15](part0015.html#preft-15) A world-historical event of considerably\nmore general significance is the discovery of the totality of effects of human\nactivity on its material support, on what we now call the\n_biosphere_.[16](part0015.html#preft-16) All the products of any labor process\nhave to be factored back into it, and for all of them. That’s a task beyond\nany master-thinker or grand plan, beyond the magic of the market or computer\nmodeling. How to think about designing the ad hoc practices for mitigating\nsuch a rift? _Molecular Red_ sets itself the lowly task of gleaning some\nforgotten histories, neglected concepts, and minor stories that might usefully\nre-orient thought to such an agenda.\n\nWe are not short of big-picture stories, either about the fate of the October\nRevolution, or the grand epoch of unchallenged capitalism since the demise of\nthe Soviet Union.[17](part0015.html#preft-17) Here the left doesn’t differ too\nmuch from the right. This is a drama of events that could be called the\n_molar_ , where big-bodied entities clash, antagonist against protagonist.\nMeanwhile, the interesting processes might be more subtle and imperceptible—\n_molecular_. Felix Guattari: “The same elements existing in flows, strata and\nassemblages can be organized in a molar or a molecular mode. The molar order\ncorresponds to signification that delimits objects, subjects, representations\nand their reference systems. Whereas the molecular order is that of flows,\nbecomings, phase transitions and intensities.”[18](part0015.html#preft-18)\n\nThe molecular is less obvious but not more real than the molar. In the pores\nof those vast dramas of class and party, nation and history, there is another\nkind of story: the Carbon Liberation Front and the metabolic rift. It’s a\nquestion of being able to perceive both molar drama and molecular gesture\ntogether, of not being too distracted by the stagecraft of the molar clash of\nembodied ideas.\n\nHow can knowledge and labor be organized to extract a _living_ from nature\nwhen that very process produces secondary effects that undermine its own\nongoing life? Taking on the Carbon Liberation Front requires not just actions\nof a number of different kinds but their integration. What we need is a kind\nof _low theory_ , for designing integrated solutions on a collaborative basis,\nwhich includes many kinds of people’s experience of the labors of the\nmolecular.[19](part0015.html#preft-19)\n\nThe unspeakable secret about climate change is that nobody really wants to\nthink about it for too long.[20](part0015.html#preft-20) It’s just too\ndepressing! Reading about it sometimes seems like helplessly watching some\nawful train derailment careen in slow motion. Rather, let’s take this world-\nhistorical moment to be one in which to reimagine what the collective efforts\nof everyone who labors could make of the world, and as a world.\n\nHere is the itinerary for _Molecular Red_ : Our story begins with Alexander\nBogdanov. Once Lenin’s rival for the leadership of the Bolsheviks, he went on\nto elaborate and occasionally even try to implement a radical practice of\nknowledge. He took the core of Marxism to be the _labor point of view_. He\nthought that if labor was to organize the world, it needed to develop its own\norganization of knowledge, which he called _tektology_ , and its own means of\ncultural development, or _proletkult_.\n\nBogdanov saw a positive role for ideologies as _worldviews_ that overcome\naffective _resistance_ to organizing the human side of collective labor.\nDrawing on the philosopher-scientist Ernst Mach, his own worldview is an\n_empiro-monism_ , which took its metaphors from advanced labor practices,\nincluding the sciences, and refused all spiritual doubles to this world. He\nunderstood the emotional appeal of the spiritual and saw _utopia_ as another\nway of motivating the needs and wants of labor in its collective tasks.\n\nBogdanov usefully delimits the category of _nature_. To him it specifies _that\nwhich labor encounters_. It’s a focused yet open way to handle a term that can\nso quickly get out of hand. But Bogdanov still thought in terms of labor’s\ndomination over nature. Here we turn to Andrey Platonov, perhaps the greatest\nproletkult writer, but one who gave up writing in the worst years of the\nRussian Civil War to become an engineer. Nature appears as harsh and\nunforgiving in Platonov, and he grasps early on that as labor presses down on\nnature, nature presses down even harder on labor. Usually thought of as a\nfiction writer, I treat Platonov as a theorist not just of the point of view\nof labor, but the point of view of _comrades_.\n\nFor Platonov, we are comrades only when we face the same dangers. Those\ndangers start with famine and the struggle to produce an _infrastructure_ that\ncould undergird the grand projects of the early Soviet period. Platonov\nextends the idea of an organization of knowledge, by and for labor, into his\nvision of a _factory of literature_ , able to collaboratively filter the\neveryday life of working people into an understanding of collective labor and\nits tasks.\n\nBogdanov was largely forgotten and Platonov mostly unknown to those who\ncreated postwar versions of Marxism as a critical theory, the best known of\nwhich center on philosophy, cultural critique or normative political thought.\nIn [Part II](part0011.html) of _Molecular Red_ I pick up the thread of those\nwriters who, while having little else in common with Bogdanov and Platonov, at\nleast worked as they did on the borders between culture and the _sciences_ ,\nand across both critical and fictional writing. My central examples are the\nCalifornian writers Donna Haraway and Kim Stanley Robinson. Our themes also\nchange here, from _Labor and Nature_ , to _Science and Utopia_.\n\nThe synthesis of Ernst Mach and Karl Marx attempted by Bogdanov has few\ninheritors. I begin [Part II](part0011.html) with one of Mach’s defenders,\nPaul Feyerabend, who finds Mach far from a simple-minded “empiricist” and\nrather a practitioner of an art of discovery, in which philosophy’s tendency\nto high theory is muted, but the experimental rerouting of concepts from one\nkind of scientific labor to another is part of a _dada_ method. It’s a way of\nkeeping the rather extravagant tendencies of language-work oriented toward\nmatters at hand.\n\nThe central node onto which Feyerabend and everyone else in [Part\nII](part0011.html) is grafted is the work of Donna Haraway, who gives the\nmetaphoric potentials of language a freer hand, rather like Bogdanov did in\nhis tektology, even though Haraway stays very close to the biological\nsciences. Haraway usefully updates Bogdanov’s account of worldview as both\nmeans and limit to organizing the world, and she confronts his concept of the\nlabor point of view not only with a _feminist standpoint_ , but also with its\nporous boundaries with other organisms, and with technology, not least in her\nfamous concept of the _cyborg_. The cyborg refigures the imaginative\npossibilities not only for critical but also for utopian thought, in these\ntimes inextricably entangled with _techno-science_.\n\nTwo other writers influenced in various ways by Haraway help flesh out the\ncyborg point of view within a world made over by techno-science. Karan Barad’s\nclose engagement with modern physics shows Mach’s tactics for thinking\nscientific knowledge at work. She introduces to the labor, or rather cyborg,\npoint of view a close attention to the _apparatus_ , as that which makes the\n_cut_ between labor and nature in the act of producing knowledge.\n\nPaul Edwards extends this concept of apparatus to that of the _knowledge\ninfrastructure_ required to collaboratively produce a science of the Carbon\nLiberation Front and its climate-changing effects. Here we witness the\ncollaborative labor of scientists and technical labor producing a new\nworldview and overcoming resistances, both technical and ideological, on a\nglobal scale.\n\nIn the age of the Carbon Liberation Front, even sunny California can seem like\na vision haunted in advance by its own ruins. No wonder critical theorists are\nnow turning to past-times, reading Saint Paul for instance, as if there was\nnothing for it as Rome burns but to day-trip in the City of God. This is why,\nto conclude _Molecular Red_ , I turn to Kim Stanley Robinson, whose majestic\n_Mars Trilogy_ science fiction novels revisit the utopian practice of Bogdanov\nfor the age of techno-science. I read these books as theoretical works.\nRobinson offers a mode of writing that really does confront this era of\nmetabolic rift with a renewal of utopian thought, in which, strangely enough,\nscience fiction turns out to be a kind of realism of the possible.\n\nLike Haraway, Robinson takes us always to be cyborg beings embedded in techno-\nscience. Like Barad, he is attentive to how different apparatuses make cuts\nthat produce different objects and subjects of knowledge. Like Platonov,\nRobinson asks how such different subjects engaged in different struggles in\nand against their object-worlds can yet be comrades. Like Bogdanov, he refuses\nan over-arching high theory in favor of a low theory of negotiating between\ndifferent worldviews.\n\nWhat Robinson offers is something like a _meta-utopia_ , a kind of writerly\nproblem-solving practice for combining different visions of an endurable\nfuture. For at the end of the day, what Bogdanov and Platonov, Haraway and\nRobinson have in common is a critical and creative approach to the _selection_\nout of the past, into the future, of ways of life that know that only if our\nspecies-being endures can it be said to touch the real.\n\nBut now, a caveat: These are strictly amateur discussions of the languages of\nthe sciences. They are not meant to settle disputes or provide an overarching\nphilosophy, still less to proffer a humanist judgment on other modes of\nknowing. I take being a theorist writing about the sciences not to be a claim\nto any kind of authority but simply as permission to be wrong. Where these\ndiscussions of the sciences are wrong, the test is whether they can be\n_usefully_ wrong, in providing metaphors or diagrams to test out in other\nfields of collective labor.\n\nA theory for the Anthropocene can be about other things besides the melancholy\nparalysis that its contemplation too often produces. Here I think there’s a\nplace for what Platonov called _secondary ideas_. What can keep the larger\nproject from becoming debilitating is getting to work on the kinds of\nknowledge practices that are useful in a particular domain. The particular\nsecondary ideas that are the topic of _Molecular Red_ are about selecting from\nwithin the archive those strands of Marxist theory for which the Anthropocene\nalready appears as an object of thought and action in all but name.\n\nAddressing the Anthropocene is not something to leave in the hands of those in\ncharge, given just how badly the ruling class of our time has mishandled this\nend of pre-history, this firstly scientific and now belatedly cultural\ndiscovery that we all live in a biosphere in a state of advanced metabolic\nrift. The challenge then is to construct the _labor perspective_ on the\nhistorical tasks of our time. What would it mean to see historical tasks from\nthe point of view of working people of all kinds? How can everyday\nexperiences, technical hacks and even utopian speculations combine in a common\ncause, where each is a check on certain tendencies of the other?\n\nTechnical knowledge checks the popular sentiment toward purely romantic\nvisions of a world of harmony and butterflies—as if that was a viable plan for\nseven billion people. Folk knowledge from everyday experience checks the\ntendency of technical knowledge to imagine sweeping plans without thought for\nthe particular consequences—like diverting the waters of the Aral\nSea.[21](part0015.html#preft-21) Utopian speculations are that secret\nheliotropism which orients action and invention toward a sun now regarded with\nmore caution and respect than it once was. There is no other world, but it\ncan’t be this one.[22](part0015.html#preft-22)\n\nMost historical thought that takes ameliorating climate change seriously\nassumes one of two big-picture narratives, the first of which is _capitalist\nrealism_.[23](part0015.html#preft-23) This insists that there is no\nalternative, and we just have to stick with the program. If it takes the\nplanet down with it then so be it. The alternative narrative imagines a kind\nof non-technical, holistic and spiritual alternative, often drawing its images\nfrom a pre-capitalist landscape. But as was already clear to Marx, this is\n_capitalist romance_ , a story constructed within capitalism itself as one of\nthe byproducts of its own momentum.[24](part0015.html#preft-24) It is a kind\nof capitalist realism in negative, where we all ride bamboo bicycles, but it\nrarely ventures beyond an ideological mirroring of capitalist realism.\n\nWhat we need then is an alternative realism. One which sticks close to the\ncollaborative labors of knowing and doing. One which opens toward plural\nnarratives about how history can work out otherwise. A realism formed by past\nexperience, but not confined to it. This requires something of a reorienting\nof critical thought away from certain dominating tendencies: rather than a\nspeculative realism in philosophy, a speculative fiction that makes no claims\nto be a spokesmodel for the object world, let alone the absolute; rather than\nan obsession with all-powerful capital and the phantasm of a pure redeeming\ncommunism, a working knowledge of the ways labor and nature confront and\nconfuse each other; rather than a totalizing critique of technology as the\nacme of Western metaphysics, a frank acknowledgment of the entangling of our\ncyborg bodies within the technical.\n\nWhat the Carbon Liberation Front calls us to create in its molecular shadow is\nnot yet another philosophy, but a poetics and technics for the organization of\nknowledge. As it turns out, that’s exactly what Alexander Bogdanov tried to\ncreate. We could do worse than to pick up the thread of his efforts. So let’s\nstart with a version of his story, a bit of his life and times, a bit more\nabout his concepts, from the point of view of the kind of past that labor\nmight need now, as it confronts not only its old nemesis of capital, but also\nits molecular spawn—the Carbon Liberation Front. Here among the ruins,\nsomething living yet remains.\n\n\n## [Acknowledgments](part0005.html#ack)\n\nTiny bits of this book appeared previously in _Public Seminar, Occupied Times_\n, the _Los Angeles Review of Books_ , the _White Review_ , and in the book\n_Realism, Materialism, Art_.

It\nis 1908 and Lenin is visiting Gorky and his houseguest Bogdanov at Gorky’s\nvilla on the island of Capri. Bogdanov won that match, and according to Gorky,\nLenin was not a good sport about it.[1](part0015.html#ch1ft-1) Gorky’s attempt\nto reconcile Lenin and Bogdanov, the leading lights of the party, did not go\nwell. Borrowing a line from _Hamlet_ , Gorky accused Lenin of trying to play\npeople like flutes. And yet of these three once-famous people, it is Lenin who\nis best remembered.\n\nIn the larger game between them, Lenin checked Bogdanov’s designs on how to\norganize the theoretical, scientific, and practical stratagems of the workers’\nmovement—and did so more than once. We rarely remember much about those whom\nthe grand masters beat in the heat. Even though, when the masters are defeated\nin their turn, there might be something to glean from the faded tactics of the\nlosers. Now that Lenin’s world too is listed in columns of the defeated,\nperhaps we can pick through the strategies of his opponents and find things of\nvalue; now that it’s time to build the world again, again.\n\nOur species-being is as builders of worlds. This is the central proposition of\nall of Bogdanov’s thought. Let’s not concern ourselves just yet with what the\nboundaries of the “human” might be. It’s a category endlessly caught up in\ndifferences and similarities with the categories of the animal, the angelic or\nthe machinic.[2](part0015.html#ch1ft-2) Let’s just think of us, for now, as\nDarwin might, as a _population_. And while we now know that all our writings\nmay well be “read” by the machines of the security agencies, I will assume\nthat the human is a population to which you, dear reader, most likely belong,\nand whose collective well-being is something you might care for. Bogdanov, who\nknew some Darwin, had more interest in the life of this species-being than in\nits definition.\n\nBogdanov’s version of social democracy was always more about the self-\norganization of workers than about building a party to seize the\nstate.[3](part0015.html#ch1ft-3) It was always more attuned to the struggle in\nand against _nature_ to organize a way of life. Nature is of course an elusive\ncategory, prone to slippage between the material and the divine, between\nsubstance and essence.[4](part0015.html#ch1ft-4) As Bogdanov was well aware,\ndifferent kinds of social organization produce wildly different images of it.\nNature is for the moment then a category without a content. It means simply\n_that which labor encounters_.\n\nBorn in the industrial town of Tula in 1873, son of a school inspector,\nBogdanov was educated at boarding school. Bogdanov: “Experience of the\nmalicious and obtuse authorities there taught me to hate rulers and deny all\nauthority. I was awarded a gold medal on completion of my\nstudies.”[5](part0015.html#ch1ft-5) He was first arrested in 1894, and\narrested and exiled several times thereafter. Exile to Vologda in 1901 only\nfurthered his political education, among the thriving dissident community\nthere. Here he wrote one of the earliest and most widely used handbooks on\nMarxist economics.[6](part0015.html#ch1ft-6)\n\nNicolai Berdyaev: “He was a remarkable man, extremely sincere and utterly\ndevoted to his ideas; but he had a rather narrow mind, and constantly engaged\nin finicky and sterile sophistry”[7](part0015.html#ch1ft-7)—including in\ndisputes with Berdyaev, who was then retreating from Marxism, in which\nBogdanov probably bested him with his sophisticated version of the same. In\nVologda he met several other internal exiles whom he later recruited into the\nBolshevik faction of Russian Social Democracy, including the future Commissar\nof Enlightenment Anatole Lunacharsky, and the co-translators of Marx’s\n_Capital_. He joined the Russian Social Democratic Workers’ Party in 1899.\n\nLike many activists in Russia at the time, he had little interest in or\nknowledge of the factional squabbles of the leaders of the party in European\nexile. He didn’t meet Lenin until 1904, in Switzerland, when he was thirty-one\nand Lenin thirty-four. There Bogdanov was welcomed into the fractious conclave\nthat was the Bolshevik faction of the party.\n\nBack in Russia, he became Lenin’s front man, and a Bolshevik representative on\nthe St. Petersburg Soviet in the 1905 revolution. The legendary Bolshevik bank\nrobber Kamo offers a colorful portrait of Bogdanov the revolutionary: “Krasin\nintroduced me to a great man. Together they run the military-technical center\nfor the Bolsheviks. You must understand that this man knows everything. He\nwrites scholarly books, he makes bombs and dynamite. He also treats patients,\nyou know, as a doctor.”[8](part0015.html#ch1ft-8)\n\nDuring the 1905 revolution Bogdanov was arrested again. In prison, he\ncompleted his first major philosophical work, _Empirio-monism_ , and on his\nrelease sent Lenin a copy. In his Finland retreat, Lenin composed a long\nletter to Bogdanov on it. Bogdanov returned the letter, writing that in the\ninterests of maintaining their political unity, he would pretend never to have\nread it. His alignment with Lenin disintegrated by 1907.\n\nThree things were at stake.[9](part0015.html#ch1ft-9) First, Bogdanov opposed\nLenin’s rightward tack after the failure of the 1905 revolution. Lenin wanted\nthe Bolsheviks to participate in elections, while Bogdanov wanted to keep the\nparty underground and continue revolutionary work, and many in the party\nagreed with him.\n\nSecond, there was apparently also some squabbling over party funds. Bogdanov\nand the Bolshevik engineer Leonid Krasin had control over money raised through\n“expropriations”—bank robberies. It is hard to imagine Lenin having much\ntolerance for political or intellectual independence, but for both to then be\ncombined with financial independence must have been particularly galling.\n\nThird, the two men were never in agreement on philosophical matters. Lenin\nhewed closer to the “dialectical materialist” orthodoxy of George Plekhanov,\nwho was aggressively opposed to the theoretical innovations starting to\nemanate from Bogdanov and his circle. Plekhanov once even wrote a polemic\naddressed to “Mr. Bogdanov”—as he refused to consider the author of such\nheresies a comrade.[10](part0015.html#ch1ft-10) Lenin and Bogdanov maintained\nunity within the Bolsheviks so long as they were agreed on tactics. When that\nunity broke down, the philosophical dispute came out in the open.\n\nBogdanov led the left-wing of the Bolsheviks against Lenin from 1907 to 1911.\nLenin’s position was a difficult one. Bogdanov may have had more support than\nLenin among the Bolsheviks in exile, and most certainly among those still in\nRussia, which may be why Lenin attacked him on philosophical rather than\npolitical grounds. He took aim at Bogdanov’s _Empirio-monism_.\n\nPublished in three volumes from 1904 to 1906, _Empirio-monism_ addresses the\nimpact on Marxist thought of the new physics, and the “spontaneous” philosophy\nthat sprang from it, of Ernst Mach and others. For Mach, a scientific theory\nis just the most economical way of describing sensory experience. He withdrew\nthe warrant for metaphysical speculation about what is real, beyond what can\nbe said about what is observed. Bogdanov found in Mach a useful line of\nretreat from the would-be materialism of Engels and Plekhanov, which had\nraised the scientific theories of their time—only some of which would prove\nenduring—into metaphysical “laws.”[11](part0015.html#ch1ft-11)\n\nAt a time of increasing repression within Russia and political crisis within\nthe party, it rather puzzled militants that Lenin in exile was spending his\ntime in libraries researching philosophical questions. The result of these\nlabors was Lenin’s lengthy polemic against Bogdanov and other “Machists,”\n_Materialism and Empirio-criticism_ (1909). Gorky thought this tract had “the\nsound of a hooligan,” but it did the job.[12](part0015.html#ch1ft-12)\n\nBeing “philosophical” rather than political may have helped the book evade\ncensorship. It certainly checked the influence not just of Bogdanov’s\ntheoretical innovations but also of his political line. Lenin secured his\nexpulsion from the Bolsheviks, and—whether intentionally or not—set the dismal\nprecedent of trials of doctrinal orthodoxy, as if correct action on any and\nevery issue required the correct “line” in philosophy.\n\nWhether Bogdanov’s political tactics would have been better than Lenin’s need\nnot concern us, but his _theoretical_ tactics certainly had—and continue to\nhave—merit, even if they diverged from the first principles of so-called\n“dialectical materialism.” But then, as Gilles Deleuze once noted, the first\nprinciples in a philosophy are less interesting than the second or third\nprinciples.[13](part0015.html#ch1ft-13) Even with third principles, there’s no\nend to the fruitless argument to be had.\n\nOf more interest might be the kinds of _practices of knowledge_ that can be\nbuilt on a particular theoretical configuration. Stuart Hall: “Theory is\nalways a detour on the way to something more\nimportant.”[14](part0015.html#ch1ft-14) It is the contention of _Molecular\nRed_ that Bogdanov offers, even today, a base on which to build a practice of\nknowledge for the era of the Carbon Liberation Front. Bogdanov retreated from\nthe sterile attempts to construct a materialist metaphysics and took his stand\non a realist approach to sensation itself, opening a path for thinking about\nthe practice of knowledge as organized sensation. Such pragmatism seems timely\nagain.\n\nAlienated from Lenin on political, practical, and theoretical matters,\nBogdanov, Gorky, and Lunacharsky formed their own faction. They ran two party\nschools in Capri in 1909 and Bologna in 1910, funded by Gorky’s earnings as a\ncelebrated writer and perhaps some expropriation funds Bogdanov still\ncontrolled. The Capri gathering was the moment when an intellectually open\nBolshevism existed, if only for a brief moment.[15](part0015.html#ch1ft-15)\n\nThe Capri school didn’t last. The students were arrested on their return to\nRussia; Bogdanov and Gorky fell out; Lenin patched up his relations with\nGorky, while Lunacharsky drifted back under Lenin’s spell. Alienated from his\nparty, by 1909 Bogdanov considered suicide. He gave up politics in 1911 to\nconcentrate on literary and scientific work. At odds with both Lenin and\nGorky, with the Bolsheviks in disarray, Bogdanov watched from afar the long,\nslow counter-revolution that unfolded in Russia. It was in these difficult\ncircumstances for the revolution, for the party, and for Bogdanov personally\nthat he wrote, of all things, a _utopia_.\n\nBogdanov’s utopia, _Red Star_ , proved rather popular, and was a founding text\nof Soviet science fiction. It is the pole-star by which Bogdanov himself\nnavigated the tempestuous times that were to follow. By attending to _Red\nStar_ , we can understand something of Bogdanov’s project and how it might be\nreimagined for the era of the Carbon Liberation Front.\n\n[RED MARS](part0005.html#sec-2)\n\n“Well, you should write a novel for the workers,” says Lenin to Bogdanov, “on\nhow the predatory capitalists have despoiled the Earth and wasted all its oil,\niron, lumber and coal. That would be a very useful book, Mister\nMachist!”[16](part0015.html#ch1ft-16) Or so Gorky recalled, or thought he\nrecalled, from Lenin’s visit to Capri. Much to Lenin’s annoyance, Bogdanov’s\nnovel was rather more original and sensational than that.\n\nThe utopian fable _Red Star_ (1908) and its prequel, the vampire story _The\nEngineer Menni_ (1913), are didactic tracts that popularized Bogdanov’s ideas\nabout labor, nature and revolution. Both are set on Mars. Older and further\nfrom the sun, Martian life is less energetic than on Earth, less violent in\nits struggles, and more advanced.[17](part0015.html#ch1ft-17) The two books,\ntaken together, are thought-experiments conducted in a parallel planet.\nCertain variables are missing—Mars lacks competing states—but in its\nessentials, pre-revolution Mars is not unlike where twenty-first-century Earth\nactually ended up after the victory of the Carbon Liberation Front.\n\nIn _Engineer Menni_ , what drives the story is the tension between a vast,\nstate-directed development project and the interests of finance capital.\nMartian capitalism is on the brink of crisis. Markets must expand, but there’s\nnowhere left to grow. Menni the engineer proposes a canal-building project as\nthe solution, a project so vast it will lead to whole new planetary spatial\nform. It will even alter the climate.\n\nA delicate political compromise puts a state-run agency in charge, but this\ndoes not appease financial interests. Meanwhile, the workers are angry about\nthe casualty rate that ensues from a particularly difficult stretch of\nterrain. Finance seizes on this as an opportunity to privatize the whole\nproject. Their alternate route for the canal is through earthquake country.\nWhile the work is easier and there’s a quick profit to be made, in the long\nrun it will endanger whole populations along the shaky new route. The logic of\naccumulating capital, with its own special reality, dominates that of labor\nstruggling in and against nature to build and maintain a habitable world.\n\nThe workers find toiling for finance capital worse than working for the\nengineer-dominated state corporation. Netti, a radical engineer, proposes a\nworker-engineer alliance against the one percent. He writes an exposé of\ncorruption and incompetence on the project, and releases it to coincide with a\ngeneral strike. Bogdanov wants to combine the interests of workers who labor\ndirectly with resistant matter with those who hack the information that\norganizes direct labor and a knowledge of nature.\n\nBut Netti’s agenda is far more ambitious: “What must we do so that we\nourselves can know and see, and not just constantly believe? Or is that\nimpossible? Is it always going to be like it is now? And if it is impossible,\nthen what is the use of living and struggling if we are to remain\nslaves?”[18](part0015.html#ch1ft-18) The worst form of slavery is believing\ninstead of knowing, of taking on faith what hasn’t been derived from the\ncareful testing of what is sensed.[19](part0015.html#ch1ft-19) The goal is not\njust to throw off the vampire squid of finance capital, but to organize again\nthe whole of labor and knowledge.\n\n_Red Star_ takes place after _Engineer Menni_ , on socialist Mars. Gender\nequality prevails, if still patterned on a masculine norm. The Martians enjoy\na liberated sexuality, free from repressive morality if not from emotional\ncomplexity. It is a vision rather like that of Bolshevik feminist Alexandra\nKollontai. Martian medicine is of course advanced. They practice blood\ntransfusion as a restorative therapy.[20](part0015.html#ch1ft-20) Bogdanov\nhere has an uncanny intimation of posthuman techniques via which the tissues\nof the human body will pass transversally from body to\nbody.[21](part0015.html#ch1ft-21) It is a field to which he will even\ncontribute himself in the last stage of his own life.\n\nOn Mars, labor has become fully socialized. The human narrator can barely\nperceive what labor has become for the more advanced Martians: “To the\noutsider the threads connecting the delicate brains of the men with the\nindestructible organs of the machines were subtle and\ninvisible.”[22](part0015.html#ch1ft-22) Bogdanov’s tract constructs a utopia\nof near-frictionless, computer-coordinated labor, to bracket off the class\nstruggle of our own Earth, and show how it masks another struggle, between\nlabor and nature. It is perhaps the earliest vision of a kind of cyber-\ncommunism as a new mode of production based on a more efficient and effective\nmode of information than the market.[23](part0015.html#ch1ft-23)\n\nBogdanov’s utopia is not a Platonist stasis. The struggle in and against\nnature continues. As a Martian explains to the gob-smacked human visitor:\n“Happy? Peaceful? Where did you get that impression? True, peace reigns among\nmen, but there cannot be peace with the natural\nelements.”[24](part0015.html#ch1ft-24) Like H. G. Wells before him, Bogdanov\ngrasped the significance of Darwin for utopian writing, which could no longer\nposit ideal states beyond the horizon of historical time. The utopian after\nDarwin had to be more of a storm-tossed ship than an eternal city on the hill.\n\nFor the Martians, the canal-building project came at a terrible price: “Only\nseventy years ago, when our coal reserves were exhausted and the transition to\nhydroelectric power was still far from complete, we were forced to destroy a\nconsiderable portion of our forests in order to give us time to redesign our\nmachines. This disfigured the planet and _worsened the climate for\ndecades_.”[25](part0015.html#ch1ft-25)\n\nThat clearing forests could have a _local_ effect on climate was understood at\nthe time.[26](part0015.html#ch1ft-26) The doctor in Chekhov’s _Uncle Vanya_\n(1897) gets in a whole speech about it. Bogdanov grasps the molecular relation\nbetween clearing and burning forests, changing the atmosphere and hence\nchanging the climate, although of course he imagines the Martian climate to be\nessentially the same as the Earth’s. What is not clear is whether Bogdanov was\nstarting to grasp the global implications.\n\nIn their search for new sources of energy, the Martians’ choice is to get it\nfrom Earth or from Venus. The former is technically easier, but involves the\ndestruction of human life. Even socialist Mars contemplates extermination when\nit is running out of energy while trying to mitigate climate change.\nFortunately their organizational culture is richer than that, and the option\nis not pursued. For Bogdanov, violence is a logical choice at lower levels of\norganization, but not at higher ones—a theme that will reappear in Robinson,\nand in Platonov in a far more desperate form.\n\nThe Martians are interested not just in science and technology but also in a\nnew kind of art: the _tragedy of the totality_. Bogdanov: “The struggle\nbetween classes, groups and individuals precludes both the idea of the whole\nand the happiness _and suffering_ implied by the\nnotion.”[27](part0015.html#ch1ft-27) The exploitation of class by class is one\nof the fetishes to be overcome in the struggle to organize the totality of\nhuman effort, in and against a world that resists the labors of our species-\nbeing. But there is no end to this more basic story, this natural history\nwithout end. Bogdanov uses the utopian literary form to write from the point\nof view of labor, but not limited to the labor point of view as capital limits\nand contains it. The happiness and suffering of the whole is at the heart of\nBogdanov’s whole teaching.\n\nLabor has to aspire, through art and science, to the tragedy of the\ntotality.[28](part0015.html#ch1ft-28) _Red Star_ aims not just to equip the\nlabor movement with some intimation of its goals, but to suggest that labor’s\nstruggle is in its origin and ends not fundamentally against the ruling class,\nbut is rather the quest to find and found a totality within which to cultivate\nthe surplus of life. Is that not still the great task of labor?\n\nThe systematic thought of forms and environments “was excluded from the minds\nof the old classes by the divisibility of their existence and the separateness\nand one-sidedness of their experience.”[29](part0015.html#ch1ft-29) But this\nview of the joy and suffering of the totality is something toward which even\nthe proletariat has to work. It has to overcome its own fetishes and\nunderstand not just its own activities but the totality of activities from the\nlabor point of view. This was the project for which Bogdanov would later\nconstruct his tektology, which has the singular merit of finding a unique form\nfor such an inquiry, even if the fate of that writing was decades of oblivion,\nthanks to Lenin and his successors.\n\nIt is notable that in _Red Star_ , Bogdanov already has inklings of the\nworkings of the Carbon Liberation Front and its relation to climate. He\nanticipates the possibility of Martian (and hence of human) generated climate\nchange at a time when the theoretical possibility was starting to occur to\nclimate scientists, even though the _infrastructure_ did not exist yet for\nmeasuring or computing climate models.[30](part0015.html#ch1ft-30) The\nMartians of _Red Star_ already possess a global knowledge concord,\nfrictionless data gathering, and computational power that Earthly climate\nscience would finally acquire by the late twentieth century. With that\ninfrastructure in place, the Martians found then what humans have found only\nnow—that collective labor transforms nature at the level of the totality.\n\nIn parallel to the writing of his utopia and its prequel, Bogdanov undertook\ntwo other important literary tasks. He was the general editor of the\ntranslation into Russian of all three volumes of Marx’s _Capital_ , which\nappeared between 1907 and 1910.[31](part0015.html#ch1ft-31) These would become\nstandard translations in the Soviet Union—even if Bogdanov’s name was removed\nfrom them. Soviet dogma would later ritually accuse Bogdanov of “idealist”\nheresies, but the fact is he knew his Marx better than most, and traces of\nMarx’s metabolic thinking, especially from the third volume of _Capital_ ,\nshow up in Bogdanov’s thought.\n\nBogdanov also set to work redacting his empirio-monist philosophy into a\ncompact volume. The result, _The Philosophy of Living Experience_ , came out\nin 1913, around the same time as _Engineer Menni_. Bogdanov had by then given\nup on exile politics and returned to Moscow. In his more philosophical\nwritings he would flesh out what was only implied in the science fiction\nnovels: the worker and engineer alliance, the labor point of view, the neither\ndialectical nor materialist Marxism, and the qualified optimism about the task\nof revolution. And this is why it is important: given that we may still need\nsome sort of revolution to head off the Carbon Liberation Front, these ideas\nmay help us to equip ourselves with some other elements of Bogdanov’s program.\n\n[_THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIVING EXPERIENCE_](part0005.html#sec-3)\n\n_The Philosophy of Living Experience_ sketches the program with which Bogdanov\ncould move forward, out of philosophy into a new practice of\nknowledge.[32](part0015.html#ch1ft-32) Within philosophy, Bogdanov’s thought\nis a species of _monism_ , which holds that there is only one substance. But\nthis is for him a point of departure from philosophy, since it has no special\nmethod for knowing it. _The Philosophy of Living Experience_ is a step toward\na _tektology_ , a new way of organizing knowledge, and a new practice of\nculture, called _proletkult_. These are still key steps toward the practice of\na molecular red knowledge of the kind we need today.\n\nBogdanov is not really trying to write philosophy so much as to hack it, to\nrepurpose it for something other than the making of more philosophy.\nPhilosophy is no longer an end in itself, but a kind of raw material for the\ndesign and organizing, not quite of what Foucault called discourses of\npower/knowledge, but more of practices of\nlaboring/knowing.[33](part0015.html#ch1ft-33) The projected audience for this\nwriting is not philosophers so much as the organic intellectuals of the\nworking class, exactly the kind of people Bogdanov’s activities as an\neducator-activist had always addressed. Having clearly read his Nietzsche,\nBogdanov’s decision is that if one is to philosophize with a hammer, then this\nis best done, not with professional philosophers, but with professional\nhammerers.\n\nBogdanov’s practice is a _détournement_ of philosophy for other purposes.\nDétournement, a term developed by the Situationists, refers to the practice of\ntaking all of past culture and knowledge to be a commons, as always and\nalready belonging to all of us.[34](part0015.html#ch1ft-34) If the Marxist\ntradition is a critique of bourgeois property, then property in knowledge is\nalso an object of critique. It turns out Bogdanov had his own critique of\nbourgeois property in knowledge, and indeed some distinctive practices of\ndétournement.\n\nBogdanov is not interested in what is unique to any given subjectivity, which\nis likely to be based on only very specific kinds of activity in the world.\nHis interest is in two kinds of collective knowing: folk knowledge and\nscientific knowledge.[35](part0015.html#ch1ft-35) Both are in their own ways\nverified and corrected by forms of collective praxis. Take for example the\nfolk knowledge embedded in proverbs. “Many hands make light work” is a\ncondensation of the experience of collective labor, as is “too many cooks\nspoil the broth.” Folk knowledge from a given stage of the development of\norganized labor about the capacities and limits of cooperation is embedded in\nthe tension between these two incompatible proverbs.\n\nWhatever their limitations, such proverbs might hold more organizational\nthought than certain kinds of formal philosophy. Professional philosophers\nhave over time become detached from other kinds of labor and from everyday\nlife. Philosophy becomes just the study of thought, and forgets its real\nsubject, which is the entirety of human experience. To the extent that\nphilosophy has responded to other kinds of activity, whether of labor or\nscience, it has been by trying to subsume them or even legislate what is\nproper for them. A critical theory can become hypocritical theory if it\nattempts to dominate other forms of knowing from other modes of collective\nexperience.\n\nAs great a work as Marx’s _Capital_ is, it is not the work of an individual\nauthor, but the product of collective experience. The author is the codifier\nof the social activity of a class:\n\n> Marx utilized a huge amount of material that was gathered before him by both\n> learned and practical people. He applied perfected methods of treatment,\n> which were also partly created and partly prepared by the efforts of\n> innumerable investigators. And he unified and tied together all the ideas\n> that express the direction of the entire development of contemporary\n> society. In a word, we have a conscious and systematic verification of the\n> ideas of all existent collective experience, consciously and systematically\n> organized according to collectively elaborated\n> methods.[36](part0015.html#ch1ft-36)\n\nOr, in short, the achievement understood under the rubric of “Marx” is not\nthat of an individual genius, but of a collective process—a “science,” broadly\nunderstood.\n\nA _science_ is that which comprehends the whole of a given domain of\ncollective experience as fully as is possible within the social organization\nand technical apparatus of its time. The scientific point of view is that\nwhich corresponds to the highest level of development of an era. There are no\nuniversal or eternal forms. Bogdanov: “There can be no absolute and eternal\nphilosophical truth.”[37](part0015.html#ch1ft-37) Universals are projections\nbeyond the limit of a given experience into a _worldview_ , which may be\nexpressed in literature or philosophy or religion.[38](part0015.html#ch1ft-38)\nThis is not, however, a species of relativism. Some worldviews are more\ngeneral than others. And while regression is possible, successful worldviews\nare usually more and more general, grasping more and more of a totality. A\nworldview overshoots the science of its time, and may either lead it or\nmislead it.\n\nScience, philosophy, and everyday experience ought to converge as the\nproletariat grows. Bogdanov: “When a powerful class, to which history has\nentrusted new, grandiose tasks, steps into the arena of history, then a new\nphilosophy also inevitably emerges.”[39](part0015.html#ch1ft-39) Marx’s work\nis a step in this direction, but only a step. Proletarian class experience\ncalls for the integration of forms of specialized knowledge, just as it\nintegrates tasks in the labor process. More and more of life can then be\nsubject to scientific scrutiny. The task of today’s thought is to integrate\nthe knowledge of sciences and social sciences that expresses the whole of the\nexperience of the progressive class forces of the moment.\n\nBogdanov: “The philosophy of a class is the highest form of its collective\nconsciousness.”[40](part0015.html#ch1ft-40) As such, bourgeois philosophy has\nserved the bourgeoisie well, but the role of philosophy in class struggle is\nnot understood by that class. It wanted to universalize its own experience.\nBut philosophies cannot be universal. They are situated. The philosophy of one\nclass will not make sense to a class with a different experience of its\nactions in the world. Just as the bourgeoisie sponsored a revolution in\nthought that corresponds to its new forms of social practice, so too organized\nlabor must reorganize thought as well as practice.\n\nThe _basic metaphor_ is the naming of relations in nature after social\nrelations.[41](part0015.html#ch1ft-41) It can be found “at work” in the theory\nof _causality_ , the centerpiece of any worldview. _Authoritarian causality_\nhad its uses: it allowed the ordering of experience, and reinforced\nauthoritarian cooperation in production. Worldviews that assume authoritarian\ncauses when none were observed usually invoke invisible spirit authorities as\ncauses. Horatio obeys Hamlet; Hamlet obeys his father’s ghost. Matter is\nsubordinated to spirit. Thus the slave model of social relations became a\nwhole ontology of what is and ever could be.\n\nBogdanov makes the striking argument that religion was the scientific\nworldview of its time. The old holy books are veritable encyclopedias,\nsomewhat arbitrarily arranged, on how to organize farming, crafts, sexuality\nor aged-care. This was a valid form of knowledge so long as an authoritarian\norganization of labor prevailed. But as technique and organization changed,\n“religious thinking lost touch with the system of labor, acquired an\n‘unearthly’ character, and became a special realm of\nfaith.”[42](part0015.html#ch1ft-42) There was a detachment of authority from\ndirect production. Religion then becomes an objective account of a partial\nworld.\n\nBogdanov thinks it no accident that the philosophical world-views that\npartially displaced religion and authoritarian causation arose where\nmercantile exchange relations were prevalent—among the\nGreeks.[43](part0015.html#ch1ft-43) Extended exchange relations suggest\nanother causal model, _abstract causality_. Buyers and sellers in the\nmarketplace come to realize that there is a force operating independently of\ntheir will, but operating in the abstract, as a system of relations, rather\nthan acting as a particular cause of a particular event.\n\nThis is an advance on authoritarian causation, but it will in turn reveal its\nlimitations in the light of more advanced forms of social organization:\n\n> in exchange relations economic necessity—external to people and foreign to\n> them—determines both their actions and the objective results of those\n> actions. The nature and origin of economic necessity will remain unknown to\n> people because they find themselves struggling with other commodity\n> producers in the marketplace, and they cannot see the social collaboration\n> which is hidden beneath this struggle. Society as a laboring whole exists\n> outside the boundaries of their thought; each producer can only see his\n> separate, partial business. Thus producers are unable to understand the\n> force of the social relation which hangs over them. They do not see the\n> living _economic connection of people_ and instead conceive of it as\n> necessity—only empty, naked, abstract necessity without any concrete social\n> content. This is how economic causality appears to the commodity\n> producer.[44](part0015.html#ch1ft-44)\n\nNevertheless, philosophy remained a mix of authoritarian and abstract causal\nmodels. Within this mix, abstract causality was the progressive development.\nIt posited an infinite set of cause-effect sequences governed by a necessity\nat once both logical and natural. Yet this causality remains abstract. It is\noften posited metaphorically as a law, as if nature itself was a judge banging\na gavel.\n\nEach successive worldview formalizes the experience of the class to which that\nexperience belongs. Bogdanov’s empirio-monism is based on the experience of\nlabor, and points beyond the limits of exchange society. One of his more\ninteresting arguments is that _both_ idealist and materialist philosophies\nfall short of the labor point of view, as both approach the world as an object\nof contemplation. Idealism takes the organization of social relations as its\nmodel for thought, while materialism tries to bypass social relations and take\nthe relations of the natural world as its object of contemplation.\n\nMaterialism at least has the advantage of being closer to labor as _praxis_ ,\nas living activity, and to be destabilized by the periodic developments of new\nnatural scientific knowledge and new labor processes. The problem with\nmaterialism is that it tends toward purely abstract accounts of nature. It\nmakes matter primary being, but as a thing apart.\n\nTwenty-first-century materialisms are no different in this regard. Slavoj\nŽižek: “Materialism has nothing to do with the assertion of the inert density\nof matter; it is, on the contrary, a position which accepts the ultimate Void\nof reality—the consequence of its central thesis on the primordial\nmultiplicity is that there is no ‘substantial reality’, that the only\n‘substance’ of the multiplicity is Void.”[45](part0015.html#ch1ft-45) Here are\nall the old vices. Here is authoritarian causation, in the form of a first\nprinciple, outside of labor, the everyday, or scientific investigation, not to\nbe further questioned, a principle of which now philosophers rather than\npriests have some special knowledge.\n\nRather than such a contemplative materialism, Bogdanov, like Marx, wants an\nactive one, an account based on the social production of human existence.\nBogdanov: “Nature is what people call the endlessly unfolding field of their\nlabor-experience.”[46](part0015.html#ch1ft-46) Nature is the arena of labor.\nNeither labor nor nature can be conceived as concepts without the other. They\nare historically co-produced concepts.\n\nThe being of nature is not something a philosophy can dogmatically claim to\nknow. It is not void, or matter; it is whatever appears as resistance in\nlabor. Bogdanov changes the object of theory from nature in the abstract to\nthe practices in which it is encountered and known: “The system of experience\nis the system of labor, all of its contents lie within the limits of the\ncollective practice of mankind.”\n\nTake thermodynamics as an example. Industrialization runs on carbon. Demand\nfor carbon in the form of coal meant that miners dug deeper and deeper.\nPumping water out of deep mines becomes an acute problem, and so the first\napplication of steam power was for pumping water out of mines. Out of the\npractical problem of designing steam-driven pumps arises the abstract\nprinciples of thermodynamics as a science.[47](part0015.html#ch1ft-47)\nThermodynamic models of causation then become the basic metaphor for thinking\nabout causation in general, extended by substitution to explain all sorts of\nthings.\n\nThere are at least two levels of labor activity: the technical and the\norganizational. Both have to overcome resistance. Technical labor has to\novercome the recalcitrance of matter itself. Organizational labor has to\novercome the emotional truculence of the human components of a laboring\napparatus. Its means of motivation is _ideology_ , which for Bogdanov has a\npositive character, as a means of threading people together around their\ntasks. What the idealist thinker unwittingly discovers is the labor-nature of\nour species-being—ideology as organization and the resistance to it—a not\ninsignificant field of experience, but a partial one.\n\nBefore Marx, neither materialists nor idealists oriented thought within labor.\nThe materialists thought the ideal an attribute of abstract matter; the\nidealists thought matter an attribute of an abstract ideal. Both suffer from a\nkind of _abstract fetishism_ , or the positing of absolute concepts that are\nessences outside of human experience and that are its cause. Bogdanov: “An\nidea which is objectively the result of past social activity and which is the\ntool of the latter, is presented as something independent, cut off from\nit.”[48](part0015.html#ch1ft-48) This abstract fetishism arises from exchange\nsociety. Causation moves away from particular authorities, from lords and The\nLord, but still posits a universal principle of command.\n\nThis is why Bogdanov takes his distance even from materialist philosophy\nbefore Marx, for it still posits an abstract causation: matter determines\nthought, but in an abstract way. Whether as “matter” or “void,” a basic\nmetaphor is raised to a universal principle by mere contemplation, rather than\nthought through social labor’s encounters with it. The revival in the twenty-\nfirst century of philosophies of speculative objects or vitalist matter is not\na particularly progressive moment in Bogdanovite terms.\n\nThe labor point of view has to reject ontologies of abstract exchange with\nnature.[49](part0015.html#ch1ft-49) Labor finds itself _in and against_\nnature. Labor is always firstly in nature, subsumed within a totality greater\nthan itself. Labor is secondly against nature. It comes into being through an\neffort to bend resisting nature to its purposes. Its intuitive understanding\nof causality comes not from exchange value but from use value. Labor\nexperiments with nature, finding new uses for it. Its understanding of nature\nis historical, always evolving, reticent about erecting an abstract causality\nover the unknown.\n\nThe labor point of view is a monism, yet one of plural, active processes.\nNature is what labor grasps in the encounter, and grasps in a way specific to\na given situation. Marx: “The chief defect of all hitherto existing\nmaterialisms … is that the thing, sensuousness, is conceived only in the form\nof the object of contemplation, but not as sensuous human activity, practice,\nnot subjectively.”[50](part0015.html#ch1ft-50)\n\nThe basic metaphor, the one which posits an image of causality, is just a\nspecial instance of a broader practice of thought. All philosophies explain\nthe world by metaphorical _substitution_.[51](part0015.html#ch1ft-51) A great\nexample in which Marx himself participates would be the way _metabolism_ moves\nbetween fields, from respiration in mammals to agricultural science to social-\nhistorical metabolism. Substitution extends from the experience of either\nnature or labor as resistance (materialism or idealism). But in either case,\nprogress in knowledge is limited. The result tends to be the thought of\nactivity without matter or of matter without activity. This is the problem\nwhich “dialectical materialism” imagines itself to have solved, although it\nhas done so only abstractly.\n\nMaterialism is concerned with a larger portion of experience and is hence more\nprogressive and more general, but it still falls short of the labor point of\nview. Materialist thought evolves as the material base evolves. For Bogdanov,\nthe history of materialism is the history of philosophy, for materialism in\nphilosophy is a kind of labor unconscious.\n\nHow can thought get outside of its cloistered world, into the great outdoors?\nThe dogmatic philosophers who preceded Kant had no trouble erecting various\nmetaphysics of the absolute. Kant brought thought back to its conditions of\npossibility as thought, and barred the way to a direct knowledge of the thing-\nin-itself. Philosophy would no longer pronounce on what is, but rather on the\nlimits to what can be known about what is. What can be known is what\ncorrelates with what a subject can know.\n\nThe limit to what a subject can know is henceforth the proper jurisdiction of\nphilosophy. Kant put paid to philosophy’s claims to a knowledge of the\nabsolute, but in so doing substituted the image of philosophy as judge of the\nconditions of thinking scientifically at all. As such, philosophy trapped only\nan image of the labor specific to science, one caught in the correlation of\nthe object of thought with the subject that thinks it, or some other dualism\nlike it.\n\nActual sciences, little by little, began working through an _apparatus_\ncapable of registering sensations that extended far beyond the scale and scope\nof the human. Science became not just a way of objectively recording what the\nsubject senses, but of recording also what a subject could never sense: scales\nway below the molecular or above the solar system; times faster even than\nthought, or epochs billions of years before the perceiving subject—before this\nonly life we know—existed.[52](part0015.html#ch1ft-52)\n\nBogdanov rightly saw Mach as pointing to a way out of Kant’s legislative\nedicts. Mach and the empirio-critics fused the object and subject of knowledge\ninto one substance— _sensation_. Quentin Meillassoux: “They acknowledged\ncorrelationism’s discovery of a fundamental constraint—viz., that we only have\naccess to the for-us, not the in-itself—but instead of concluding from this\nthat the in-itself is unknowable, they concluded that the correlation is the\nonly veritable in-itself.”[53](part0015.html#ch1ft-53) It remained only for\nBogdanov to connect sensation back to labor, to the experience of the\ncollective and historical task of its production. This is the passage from the\nempirio-criticism of Mach to the _empirio-monism_ of Bogdanov.\n\nEmpirio-monism will emerge as a synthesis of the philosophies of Marx and\nMach, which Bogdanov takes to be the advanced forms of the point of view\nrespectively of industrial labor and scientific labor. Or, in twenty-first-\ncentury terms, workers and hackers, where the latter includes all kinds of\nnon-routine scientific, technical and intellectual labor, whose object is not\ndetermined in advance as it is in industrial\nlabor.[54](part0015.html#ch1ft-54)\n\nIn Bogdanov’s reading, the central category in Mach and his empirio-critical\nschool is sensation, but not as individual sensation. Sensation is an\nundecidable assemblage of sense impressions and material forms. Bogdanov: “The\nempirio-critics strove to overcome the duality of things and psychical facts,\nto advance philosophical thought towards realism, towards living experience,\nfrom which it has been separated.”[55](part0015.html#ch1ft-55) The only\nmaterial with which knowledge works is sensation, and the goal of knowledge is\nfinding an orientation within that experience.\n\nAll elements of experience are continuous with each other. The empirio-critic\nbegins with the critical method of breaking experience up into elements, with\nthe goal of describing integrated wholes. The basic metaphor of causality is\n_functional dependency_ : this happens and then that happens. Bogdanov reads\nthis basic metaphor in Mach as a materialist causality, but of a still rather\nabstract kind.\n\nFor Mach, knowledge _describes_ experience and orders it, but it doesn’t\nintend to change it. This worldview expresses the role of technical and\nscientific labor, particularly in the new research institutes of the time, and\nthe emerging organizational role of the intellectual in\nproduction.[56](part0015.html#ch1ft-56) It is a world of intellectual workers,\ndetached from that social labor with direct experience of the resistance of\nnature. Theirs is a fetishistic abstraction—an imagining of the resistance of\nnature in formal terms only, like in a lab experiment.\n\nThe scientist’s experience of labor relations was still an authoritarian one.\nHence the persistence of dualities of thought, of forms of idealism, and of\nthe tendency to see the world as subordinate to abstract schemes. Mach’s\nthought is still that of his class, although not in a simple way. It is partly\nlimited to causal models drawn from the exchange relations of advanced\ncapitalism. It is also partly drawn from the authoritarian habits in relation\nto that labor which works more directly on resistant nature in the\nlaboratory.[57](part0015.html#ch1ft-57)\n\nThe kind of dialectical materialism in which Lenin so devoutly believed was\nnot for Bogdanov a particularly plausible alternative to these sorts of\nspontaneous philosophy of the scientific and technical workers. The dialectic\nis an idealist residue within an otherwise active and materialist theory.\nMarx’s dialectic was unreal and still abstract, imposed from without, falling\nshort of a metaphor which could substitute for any and every experience of\nprocess. The dialectic is not a universal method, as Hegel and Marx still\nmaintained. It is only a cognitive model taken from human organizational\nexperience, and from a narrow realm of experience at that.\n\nBogdanov: “Idealism by its nature does not know real, sensuous\nactivity.”[58](part0015.html#ch1ft-58) German idealism came up with an active\nprocess, but it is an explanation which substitutes the logic of ideas for\nliving practices. With Hegel it at least rose to the level of systematizing\nthis zone of experience. Feuerbach tried to turn philosophy away from the\nself-developing idea to the self-development of the species-being of man in\nand against resisting nature.[59](part0015.html#ch1ft-59) But Feuerbach\nretreats to the petit-bourgeois scale of the family and affective life. He\ngets beyond individualism—even the individualism writ large of Hegel—but does\nnot get to collective labor. He does not make the transit from molar to\nmolecular perceptions of experience that comes with the labor point of view.\n\nLabor as social activity, in and against nature, is what is central to Marx,\nnot an abstract concept of material nature. He grasped that matter and\nactivity are not just correlates but aspects of the same—monistic—process. He\nmoves beyond Hegel’s ideal contradictions to concrete forces at work. But his\ndialectic was still idealist. There is a limit to explaining the world through\nstruggles of opposites, which substitute the form of linguistic relations for\nall other relations.[60](part0015.html#ch1ft-60)\n\nWhile sympathetic to Joseph Dietzgen, the worker-philosopher, Bogdanov did not\nthink it progress to retreat from Marx’s engagement with Hegel to Spinoza,\nwhich resulted in an even more abstract and contentless monism. Dietzgen was,\nhowever, the source for Bogdanov’s idea that there could be specifically\nproletarian class-forms of thought, or\n_proletkult_.[61](part0015.html#ch1ft-61) Dietzgen’s achievement, like Marx’s,\nis neither the dialectic nor materialism, but the _labor point of view_.\n\nBogdanov saved his critical attention for the so-called dialectical\nmaterialism of Lenin and Plekhanov, where “man and his consciousness are\nposited as the passive product of external matter. This is that reflective\nrelationship which was characteristic of all old materialisms and against\nwhich Marx asserted himself. Matter is an object of human activity\n…”[62](part0015.html#ch1ft-62) The dogmatic insistence on the causal priority\nof matter as thing-in-itself places matter outside of experience. It becomes\nan article of faith. An authoritarian causal first principle—that the world is\nmade of matter—is simply asserted.\n\nThis is contrary to the scientific worldview and practice, where a knowledge\nof matter is to be produced by experiment with an apparatus rather than\nthrough contemplation alone. Such scientific methods are not really explained\nby the dialectic. The problem with dialectical materialism is that it doesn’t\ncriticize the dialectic in the light of labor and scientific experience. The\ndialectic describes only a part of the organizational whole, the molar\nstruggle for authority of rival ideas for organizing labor. It does not\nnecessarily also explain labor’s experience in and against nature.\n\nBogdanov’s empirio-monism is a critique of the dialectic, but one which takes\nfrom Marx the active worldview and the collective experience of the\nproletariat. The starting point is a realistic view of activity and what\nresists it. The sensation of matter is a product of social activity, not a\nthing-in-itself. The practice of knowledge is to search for explanations of\nprocesses, and its aim is nothing less than _organizing the world_.\nOrganizational processes can move from less to more complexity, but are not\nnecessarily dialectical.\n\nBogdanov: “Elements of the dialectic may be found almost everywhere, but life\nand movement are not exhausted by them. Philosophy must, consequently,\nconceive of its task in the broadest and most general form: to research the\nbonds of the world process in order to discover all possible ways and means of\norganization. Such is the basic notion of Empirio-\nmonism.”[63](part0015.html#ch1ft-63) It is a low theory of the discovery and\ncommunication of potential forms of organization between different experiences\nin a comradely way.\n\nThe labor point of view calls for a thought which embodies its ambitions.\nBogdanov: “Dialectical materialism was the first attempt to formulate the\nworking-class point of view on life and the\nworld.”[64](part0015.html#ch1ft-64) But not the last. Strikingly, the labor\npoint of view implies a new understanding of causality. The apparatuses of\nboth modern science and machine production generate new experiences of\ncausation. As in modern chemistry, labor can interrupt and divert causal\nsequences. Matter is not a thing-in-itself beyond experience, but a\nplaceholder for the not-yet-experienced.\n\nBogdanov’s example is the concept of energy, which is neither substance nor\nidea but whose discovery emerges out of the practical relationship of the\nlabor apparatus to a nature which resists it. Energy is not _in_ coal or oil,\nbut an outcome of an activity of labor on these materials. Bogdanov: “Labor\ncausality gives man a program and a plan for the conquest of the world: to\ndominate phenomena, things, step by step so as to receive some from others and\nby means of some to dominate others.”[65](part0015.html#ch1ft-65)\n\nHere Bogdanov retains a rather authoritarian worldview, but imposed on nature,\nrather than on a subordinate class. That there can be unintended effects of\nsuch interventions on a resistant nature has not quite occurred to him as a\nconcept, even though he intuits it, as shown in the peak energy and climate\nchange problems confronting his Commie Martians in _Red Star_. Bogdanov has\nnot entirely overcome the authoritarian streak in his own activity. He may not\nbe a Leninist, but he still thinks like a Bolshevik. His thought is marked by\nthe organizational limits of his times. But then, as good Bogdanovites, we\nknow all philosophies are bound to their era and do not touch the eternal. Or\nas Guy Debord once put it: “Theories are made to die in the war of\ntime.”[66](part0015.html#ch1ft-66)\n\n[TOWARD A COMRADELY POETICS OF KNOWLEDGE AND LABOR](part0005.html#sec-4)\n\nWhile rejecting Bogdanov’s residual attachment to an authoritarian relation of\ncollective labor to nature, his practices of organization still have something\nto recommend them, and are worth a little further elaboration. The elements of\nexperience have to be not only efficiently named but also combined in new ways\nwith a view to new or better labor processes. This is the seed of Bogdanov’s\nidea of a practice of tektology. Neither a theory or a science, tektology is a\npractice which generalizes the act of substitution by which one thing is\nunderstood metaphorically via another.[67](part0015.html#ch1ft-67) It is a\npractice of making worldviews.\n\nRather than unconsciously using metaphors borrowed from authoritarian or\nexchange relations, the wager of tektology is that it might be possible to\nconstruct a kind of low theory whose purpose is to experimentally apply\nunderstandings of one process to other quite different processes to see if\nthey can be grasped as analogous. It is a kind of détournement that works\n“sideways,” from field to field, rather than from past to present.\n\nFor Bogdanov, labor is first physical, then mental. Physical labor is always\nsocial, whereas psychic labor is always negotiating the idiosyncratic\nphilosophies of individuals. What is objective is what is socially agreed. A\ncertain trade-off comes at this point if one thinks empirio-monism\nconsistently. The physical world _as we know it_ cannot be thought as\npreceding our labors upon it. The world is not absolute or eternal, even if,\nat each moment in the history of social labor, objective worldviews form that\nclaim certain things are absolute and eternal.\n\nWhat appears _objective_ is the product not of thought alone but of the social\nlabor apparatus of all kinds. Bogdanov insists that no “reality” limits social\nlabor in advance, as limits are discovered in practice. Here he is expunging\nresidues of the Gods, even from within materialism. A really consistent\n“materialism” cannot claim to speak of the nature of the world in advance of\npractices in and against it. Bogdanov: “the practical organization of labor\neffort precedes the mental organization of the elements of experience and\nproduces it.”[68](part0015.html#ch1ft-68)\n\nAs we shall see later, an example is the evolution of climate science. It has\nthree elements: predicting the weather, modeling the climate, and the physics\nof how both weather and climate work. It took many decades to bring all three\ntogether. Gathering timely weather data from disparate locations and altitudes\nrequires a huge, global apparatus. Crunching that data with an accurate model\nof the physics takes a vast amount of computational power. Data,\ncommunication, and computational resistances impeded the study of climate\nuntil the late twentieth century. At the base of our contemporary knowledge of\nclimate, and climate change, is an evolution from discrete fields and\ntechnologies to a global climate knowledge infrastructure, requiring\ncoordinated global labors, or in Bogdanov’s terms, a kind of\ntektology.[69](part0015.html#ch1ft-69)\n\nWhile our worldview is always partial and limited, bound by the labor\npractices of our time, some perspectives are better than others. Some\ncorrespond to more advanced, in the sense of more general, forms of labor\nactivity. In Bogdanov’s time, it appeared as if the industrial working class\nwas the avant-garde of organizational practice. In our own time, Kim Stanley\nRobinson suggests that the scientific, technical _and_ creative work of\nhackers occupies such a position. The Bogdanovite challenge is to think from\nthe point of view of the most advanced, general and complex forms of social\nactivity.\n\nLabor may well take different forms than it did in Bogdanov’s time, but his\nkey method for making a low theory that passes between forms of labor may\nstill apply. _Substitution_ is the method of systematizing labor’s various\nexperiences. The means of organizing labor process A may turn out to be\nhelpful for process B. Substitution is a kind of détournement, by which the\nformal properties of any given activity can become the experimental template\nfor any other. The product of the sum of all labors belongs to the laboring\nclasses as a whole.\n\nSo too the _conceptual product_ of any particular encounter with resistant\nnature belongs to all, and can inform the invention of yet more kinds of\norganization through an experimental practice of substitution. Substitution is\npart of an experimental process for finding out which discoveries and\ninventions of labor can be generalized. The concept of fluid dynamics, which\nproved so useful for engineering A-bombs, is also at work in climate science,\nnot to mention other fields of application. Bogdanov: “Substitution in general\nstrives to replace lesser contents with greater, permitting more combinations\nin consciousness such that the material for processing will be richer, and, at\nthe same time, to replace complexes more simple and strictly organized with\nless structured, less organized complexes such that the resistance to the\nprocessing activity will be less.”[70](part0015.html#ch1ft-70)\n\nLabor causality and substitution are two versions of the same proposition. No\nsubstitution is forbidden in advance. Each production of a causal series by\nlabor points to other possible causal series. Bogdanov, who was not a\nparticularly poetic writer, nevertheless advocates a poetics of knowledge\nformation. This will become his tektology, which is at heart a poetics of the\nexperimental substitution of one relation for another which in turn has to be\ntested in practice. Not all substitutions will work. For instance, there is a\nlimit to how much _metabolism_ will explain about agricultural chemistry or\nthe totality of collective labor.\n\nEmpirio-monism is a worldview that frees our species-being from external a\npriori forms. Philosophy codifies present reality and no other. It\nmetaphorically substitutes a class interest and experience toward the\nworld.[71](part0015.html#ch1ft-71) Philosophy is scientific when based on\ncollective experience. From the labor point of view, philosophy is not of\nespecial interest as a high theory, a specialized domain which produces\nknowledge of the world through the systematic production of relations within\nlanguage. Rather, it can become a low theory, whose task is to extract from\nparticular labor processes those diagrams of form and relation that might have\nexperimental application elsewhere.\n\nOr rather, this low theory is what replaces philosophy now that its\nGods—authoritarian and abstract causality—are passing from the objective\nreality of the world as labor makes and remakes it. Philosophy is not the form\nof knowledge with which we need ultimately be concerned. It’s a step toward\nsomething else. Bogdanov: “No effort of thought can gather and organize the\nparts of a shattered body into a living whole. Philosophy cannot work\nmiracles.”[72](part0015.html#ch1ft-72) The detour of critical theory through\nphilosophy can come to an end, not because the problems of philosophy have\nbeen “solved,” but because in the Anthropocene labor and science have other\nproblems. Not the least of which is the challenge of the Carbon Liberation\nFront.\n\nThe form of knowledge that the present requires is determined by forms of\nsocial labor and the kinds of resistance it encounters. Automation requires\nknowledge beyond immediate experience. Bogdanov thought that as automation\nadvanced, all workers would become more like engineers, and also more like\nartists—like the Martians in _Red Star_. In the Bogdanovian future, workers\ncease to be workers, organizers of their particular labor alone, but become\nco-creators of the whole of social organization. The science and poetics of\norganization become the tools for changing the world, superseding philosophy.\n\nBogdanov did not anticipate deskilling, or the counter-attack via which\ncapital used technology to prevent the accumulation of knowledge by workers in\nthe workplace.[73](part0015.html#ch1ft-73) He did not anticipate that the\nruling class would so effectively co-opt the surpluses of time and\ninformation, let alone of life. Bogdanov’s thought appears limited to his time\nin at least three respects.\n\nFirst, it is limited by the furthest advances of industrial labor of the\nscience of the time. Second, Bogdanov expunged authoritarian relations within\nproletarian knowledge and labor practice, but not between labor and nature.\nThird, tektology clearly implies the dissolution of philosophy as the system-\nbuilding of the master thinker into a low theory that is collectively and\ncollaboratively produced, and yet Bogdanov cannot quite stop himself from\nengaging in a system-building that overshoots the limits of his own core\nprinciples. Still, he makes a great case for empirio-monism as the last\n_necessary_ philosophy, and tektology as the beginning of something else.\n\nFor labor to becoming self-organizing is for labor to acquire not just a\nknowledge of technical labor but also to take over the functions of\norganizational labor from the bourgeoisie. Labor has to acquire its own\npractices of coordination on larger and larger scales. The Russian revolutions\nof 1917 directly posed the problem of just how much of the social formation\norganized labor could claim to manage, and how. Before a _tektology_ of\norganizing the material world can apply, a _proletkult_ has to emerge within\nwhich workers acquire for themselves the confidence to organize the world.\n\nIn the era of the Carbon Liberation Front, tektology prefigures a pressing\nneed to coordinate the social labor of confronting metabolic rift. Proletkult\nprefigures the no less pressing need to elaborate a new folk knowledge of\ncooperative labor’s abilities, limits, and challenges.\n\n[RED HAMLET: FROM SHAKESPEARE TO MARX](part0005.html#sec-5)\n\nSomething is rotten in the October Revolution. Bogdanov was not alone in this\nsuspicion. It was shared by many of the Russian and European\nleft.[74](part0015.html#ch1ft-74) Bogdanov worked both in and against the new\nSoviet state. His critique of the course of events was uncannily accurate,\neven though his actions were, in the end, futile. His biographer calls him Red\nHamlet, and like Hamlet, he had to glide through the superstructures of a new\nworld with rotten roots, speaking in riddles, while the old mole labored away\nbelow, undermining it.[75](part0015.html#ch1ft-75)\n\nOne of Bogdanov’s more engaging bits of journalism is actually about\nShakespeare’s _Hamlet_ , in which he illustrates how the proletariat can\nusefully read the classics of the past to help it act within its present\ncondition.[76](part0015.html#ch1ft-76) It is still a good statement of the\nBogdanovite practice of détournement. It has the added charm of functioning as\nan allegory of Bogdanov’s own fate in the Soviet Union. How intentionally he\nmeant it to be read as such we may never know. It remains an allegory for our\ntimes, too.\n\nHamlet is a soul torn between love and struggle. Bogdanov: “What should be\ndone to restore harmony to the soul rent asunder by the sharp conflict between\nits deepest and sublimest need, and the imperious demand dictated by the\nhostility of his environment?” The proletariat too has this problem: it wants\nharmony and unity, but has to struggle with the rift between exchange value\nand use value. “Little joys have been given it, and great is the thirst for\nthem; but even that little is constantly threatened with destruction or\ndeformation by the inevitable elements of social hatred and anarchy.”\n\nBy contrast, Hamlet’s life has been a good one. Study abroad made him a\ncultured man, and he has the love of Ophelia.[77](part0015.html#ch1ft-77) But\nupon returning to his native land, horror grips him. He finds his family\ndestroyed, his country shattered, a traitor on the throne, the good old\ncustoms breached, not honored. Even his mother is in the camp of the enemy.\nSomething must be done, but what? Is he able to accomplish it? He has to be\nnot just an aesthete, but an activist.\n\nHamlet must resort to tactics hostile to his nature. Bogdanov: “Here is the\nessence of the tragedy. The struggle demands from Hamlet a resort to cunning,\ndeception, violence and cruelty; but these are repulsive to his mild and\nrefined soul. And more, he has to direct them against his nearest and\ndearest.” This, he cannot do, at least not directly:\n\n> His hand, which is raised for the blow, is stopped; the inner struggle\n> paralyses his will, the momentary resolution gives way to hesitation and\n> inaction, time passes in fruitless meditation—the result is a deep duality\n> and for a time even the wreck of his personality: everything is confused in\n> the chaos of unavoidable contradictions, Hamlet “becomes insane.”\n\nAn ordinary person would have been crushed in such a situation, yet Hamlet\nbecomes the activist-aesthete, “the champion of the harmony of life.” He\nbecomes the example within the everyday that another life is possible. He\nenacts the good life. “The organizational problem is solved, the artistic idea\nhas been clothed in form.” He wagers against the brief, violent time of\nintrigue with the long loops of everyday culture.\n\nMost prophetically, Bogdanov writes in conclusion: “Hamlet, it is true,\nperished; and in this the great poet is objectively right, as always. The\nenemies of Hamlet had this advantage: while he was gathering the forces of his\nsoul, they acted, and prepared everything for his destruction.” Bogdanov too\nwill die from a poisoned point.\n\nWhat Bogdanov constructs within the emerging Soviet spectacle is proletkult, a\nsort of counter-spectacle, which can say the unsayable while it can still be\nsaid, just as Hamlet had his players do. He refuses what he once loved. He\nrefuses to join a world given over to intrigue. He writes the lines, but it is\nthe part of the historical actor, the proletariat, to figure out how to play\nthem. The play’s the thing, with which to catch the conscience, not of the\nking, but of the proletariat itself.\n\nOn several key points, he called it: The struggle against capitalism is not\nthe same as the struggle for socialism. The Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917\nwas premature. Revolutions can be regressive as well as progressive, leading\nto less rather than more complex organization. The Bolshevik’s coercive policy\nof war communism was no different to the expediencies of other wartime states\nand was not a step toward socialism. War communism turned the worker’s party\ninto a soldier’s party. Labor should neither be militarized (Trotsky) nor\nTaylorized (Lenin). While the peasants had to be appeased, the long-term\nalliance should be between workers and technical personnel. It is not enough\nto learn from advanced capitalist culture; socialist forms have to be invented\nwithin and against it.[78](part0015.html#ch1ft-78)\n\nBogdanov recasts Hamlet’s role for a different time in not only creating a\ncounter-spectacle, but in mapping out a pedagogy for how proletarian culture\ncould become self-determining. The task of proletarian culture is the\ndétournement of the past rather than the rejection or admiration of it. The\novercoming of bourgeois modes of organization requires a broader grasp of\norganizational forms. The proletariat had to learn for itself the history of\norganizational design. This provides the key protocol for how to read the\nculture of the past.\n\nShakespeare’s _Hamlet_ can be usefully read as a work from the last days of\nthe feudal world. It has a double form: the molar form presents a struggle\nbetween an illicit hierarchy and a legitimate one, against the backdrop of\nmilitary maneuverings. On the molar level, the king is to his minions “a massy\nwheel, fix’d on the summit of the highest mount, to whose huge spokes ten\nthousand lesser things are mortised and adjoin’d.” The molecular form is\nHamlet’s perception of a quite different organization of matter: “A man may\nfish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed\nof that worm.” Hamlet’s madness is in seeing through the huggermugger of\ncourtly mischief to this other scale of organization which knows no ideal\nhierarchies.\n\nEven the feudal aspect of _Hamlet_ does not destroy its legacy for the\nproletariat. What can be extracted from a Bogdanovite reading of its worldview\nis something like what Raymond Williams calls a _structure of feeling_ of a\nfeudal mode of organization.[79](part0015.html#ch1ft-79) This is what it feels\nlike to organize the world through authoritarian relations that present\nthemselves as divinely inspired. The play’s merit is more than “to show you\nhow a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.” Or, to show the\nvanity of that authority that would “go to gain a little patch of ground that\nhath in it no profit but the name.” It might teach as well that no matter what\nthe form of state, “the readiness is all.”\n\nIt is not as if authoritarian forms belong only in the past. Their study can\nspeak to the present in illuminating ways as well:\n\n> It also becomes clear why the patriarchal petit-bourgeois and peasant family\n> is so attached to religion, to the “law of God”; and at the same time we can\n> see the great danger in the way of social progress that this fecund seed of\n> authoritarianism may represent if it is preserved. A new light is shed upon\n> the role of party leaders, on authorities and the significance of collective\n> control over them.\n\nMarx begins the process of the détournement of the past from the labor point\nof view, starting with bourgeois economics and its petit-bourgeois critics\nfrom Feuerbach to Fourier. Bogdanov: “All this received a new form and was\narranged in new combinations, it was turned into a tool for the building of a\nproletarian organization.” Marx extracts molecular flows, of concepts, of\nevidence, out of the old molar world view of the old ruling class. He\ncontinues in no tradition. Quite the reverse. He appropriates textual\nmaterials into the labor point of view from the extant discourses of his time.\n\nMarx is not a philosopher or an economist or a sociologist and still less a\ntheologian. He détourns from all of the above, ignoring property and propriety\nand paternity in the process.[80](part0015.html#ch1ft-80) He begins a new\npractice of knowledge from a novel point of view. Bogdanov continues in that\nvein. He is not faithful to Marxist writ, but détourns Marx and the modern\nlife sciences from the labor point of view, with the same disregard for\nproperty and propriety and paternity.\n\nIf the proletariat wants different modes of organization to bourgeois ones,\nthen there is a lot to learn from forms of organization that were as different\nto the bourgeois modes as the proletarian ones aspire to become. “And who\nelse, if not the great and skillful artist, can lead one into the very depths\nof an alien organization of life and thought?”[81](part0015.html#ch1ft-81)\nBogdanov was perhaps not skilled enough an artist to describe Martian\norganization, but he was a good enough organizer to create the space where it\nmight come into being of its own accord—the Proletkult movement.\n\n[FROM MARX TO PROLETKULT](part0005.html#sec-6)\n\nAfter the October Revolution, Proletkult had an uneasy relationship with the\nCommissariat of Enlightenment, headed by Anatole Lunacharsky, Bogdanov’s old\nfriend and former comrade of the Capri school\ndays.[82](part0015.html#ch1ft-82) The Commissariat took over the cultural and\neducational activities of the old Tsarist state. Proletkult, on the other\nhand, was interested in a specially proletarian culture. While Lunacharsky was\nnot unsympathetic to Proletkult, his support or tolerance could only be\npartial. The biggest problem of his ministry—and its biggest success—was in\nraising levels of literacy. He lent support to a variety of factions and\ngroups on the cultural left, of which Proletkult was only one.\n\nAmong the Bolshevik leadership, only Bukharin was at all supportive. Lenin\nmost notably was not. Since Proletkult received its budget from the\nCommissariat of Enlightenment, and hence from the Bolshevik-controlled state,\nits desire for an autonomous proletarian culture was always compromised.\nStill, for a time it aroused considerable enthusiasm, and not least among\nclass-conscious workers themselves. Bogdanov nearly got his version of the\ncounter-spectacle to happen within and against the Bolshevik one.\n\nFor Bogdanov, scientists, artists, and philosophers are “organizers of\nexperience” and the proletarian revolution should in turn organize their\nlabors in a certain way.[83](part0015.html#ch1ft-83) If culture grows out of\nparticular experiences within the relations of production and exchange, then\nthe proletariat could not simply adopt or adapt bourgeois culture. Proletarian\nculture needed developing, not just as new content within the old forms, but\nas a new form of culture altogether. Most centrally, proletarian culture had\nto develop organically out of the experience of collaborative labor. The ethos\nof bourgeois individualism had grown out of competitive market relations; the\nethos of proletarian collaboration would grow out of the sophisticated self-\norganization of labor in the most advanced industries.\n\nThis was hardly an academic question. The Russian Revolution faced an\nimpossible decision in 1917. Put crudely: The proletariat could be mobilized\nto seize control of strategic assets, but if it moved quickly and alone, its\nleaders faced the challenge of making a revolution without the help of\nspecialists, technicians, and others of the educated class. This was the\nBolshevik policy. The Menshevik policy, at least in its more cogent moments,\nwas to take it slow, to try to forge a united front between the proletariat\nand the intelligentsia—not unlike what transpired in Bogdanov’s imaginary\nMartian revolution. With the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks seized the\ninitiative, but as a consequence took control of a state and an economy with\nbarely the means to run them.\n\nProletkult created a network of studios in both the arts and the sciences\n(although they worked best in the arts). The aim was self-governed activity on\nthe part of workers rather than propaganda or consciousness raising.\nProletkult sought liberation from fetishes such as authority, subjectivity,\nand property. Bogdanov even thought this might be easier in Russia, where\neveryday life was barely touched by bourgeois norms.\n\nProletkult was a movement with a mission: to _change labor_ , by merging art\nand work; to _change everyday life_ , by developing the collaborative life\nwithin the city and changing gender roles and norms; and to _change affect_ ,\nto create new structures of feeling, to overcome the emotional friction of\norganizing the labor that in turn organizes nature around its appetites.\n\nRealizing Proletkult’s mission was the aim of a threefold practice:\n\n_Creativity_ —to overturn the fetish of the individual creator; to reveal the\nrole of the unconscious in creation. The newspaper was the model of a\ncollective creativity. One might note that all significant Marxists were also\ngreat journalists, and often editors and publishers as well, starting with\nMarx himself.[84](part0015.html#ch1ft-84)\n\n_Collectivity_ —to work in groups and express the sensations of group life.\nBogdanov did not however want to submerge singularities. His is rather the\ncommunity those who have nothing in common.[85](part0015.html#ch1ft-85) His\nMartians, for example, were far from indistinguishable numbers, and their\ncooperation is imperfect.\n\n_Universalism_ —to break down the division of labor. This raised the problem\nof professionalism: should Proletkult have professional artists? When the\ngoing gets weird, as it did in the civil war, even as weird a writer as Andrey\nPlatonov could turn pro, although in the end his professional success was\nmeager. Professional specialization remained a conceptual problem for the\nwhole life of the movement.\n\nProletarian culture is not an end in itself, and in this regard Proletkult is\ndifferent to most flavors of workerism. It can tend to a certain fetishism of\nits limited perspective, rather than trying to expand out toward the most\ngeneral account of the experience of the world. The violent rejection of\nbourgeois culture is no better than naive atheism. It is not able to put up\nanything as an alternative. The proletariat needs a point of view through\nwhich to assimilate the past. Proletarian détournement is not then a matter of\npicking out the bits that seem “revolutionary.” The proletariat should be\nself-developing rather than self-mythologizing.[86](part0015.html#ch1ft-86)\n\nBogdanov anticipates those who, like Henri Lefebvre, move the focus of\nproletarian self-determination from the space of the factory alone to the\nspace of everyday life in the city as a whole.[87](part0015.html#ch1ft-87) The\ncity provides the situations for the development of the labor point of view.\nIt is in the city that the worker can discover that in the struggle against\nthe elements for existence the individual is a node in a web. On their own,\nworkers are powerless playthings of external forces.\n\nThe city extends the time and complexity of cooperative action, but it has its\nlimits: “while the masses are gathered in the cities, they become removed from\nnature. The latter reveals itself to the proletariat only as a force in\nproduction, not as a source of live impressions.”[88](part0015.html#ch1ft-88)\nThe proletariat has to learn a more systematic way to organize its\nexperiences.\n\nBogdanov co-authored a textbook of political economy that came out in 1919,\nand appears as his major contribution to pedagogy during the\nrevolution.[89](part0015.html#ch1ft-89) It must have seemed somewhat\ncounterintuitive to Bolsheviks at the time, in its stress on the revolutionary\nforce of capitalism and its role in the development of the forces of\nproduction. The discussion centered on the development of an organic social\nsystem. As the pioneering Bogdanov scholar Ilmari Susiluoto puts it: “He had\nset his sights centuries ahead. He could not, therefore, provide exact advice\non how a new society should be built. The ideal should be implemented through\na prolonged period of learning, in the process of which the collective\nexperience would raise the awareness of the people to a new\nlevel.”[90](part0015.html#ch1ft-90)\n\nBogdanov thought a major area of proletarian learning had to be around new\nenergy systems. Fossil fuels were limited and non-renewable. Tides and winds\nhad to be harnessed as energy sources, as well as the “internal energy of the\natom.” The power of the atom would also be a stimulus to more cooperative\nforms of government.\n\nThat cooperative form of government was more a form of what he elsewhere\ncalled the _biregulator_ , where two systems regulate each other. In this case\nthe two systems are labor and nature, and their relationship one of\nstatistical automation. Bogdanov:\n\n> Since all goal oriented human activity is organizational in character, the\n> organization of natural elements for the benefit of society is a technical\n> process; the organization of experiences is a process of consciousness; the\n> organization of human forces in society is an economic process. All of these\n> join together in principle to form a single organization of socio-productive\n> energy.[91](part0015.html#ch1ft-91)\n\nThe deficit of organizational intelligence made the formation of a proletarian\nculture, of a new type, a pressing agenda. The prevailing position in the\nBolshevik Party was that the political revolution abolished the class basis of\nculture and made all of the cultural inheritance of the past common\nproperty.[92](part0015.html#ch1ft-92) Bogdanov insisted that culture wasn’t\njust “content” that could be poured into a new form. Culture was itself a\nseries of forms which had a definite class character. The proletariat had to\nstruggle for its own form of culture, which Bogdanov saw as an extension of\nthe commons of collaborative and experimental practice embodied in industrial\nlabor at its most sophisticated.\n\nProletarian culture had to be more than bourgeois novels and symphonies mass\nproduced for a mass audience by a “socialist” culture industry. It also had to\nbe more than an extension of the Bolshevik propaganda of the revolutionary\nperiod, bringing consciousness from without. Proletarian culture should rather\ngrow out of the laboratory that is labor, and the labor that is the\nlaboratory.\n\nThis was also different to the avant-garde modernism that flourished in the\nearly days of the Soviet Union, which confined innovation to questions of\nliterary or plastic form. Bogdanov wanted to revolutionize the relations of\nproduction of culture, not just literary form or affective\ncontent.[93](part0015.html#ch1ft-93) Proletkult did not mean this or that\nmodernist style of poem or painting. It meant the collaborative production of\nart, culture, even science, by and for the proletariat itself.\n\nProletkult was popular in the civil war period, although this may have been in\npart because the spaces Proletkult commandeered had food and\nheat.[94](part0015.html#ch1ft-94) It rapidly became a mass movement, and\ntogether with the trade unions, it provided some semblance of balance to the\npower of the Bolshevik Party within the state. When the civil war turned in\nthe Bolshevik’s favor, and the party had less need of equivocal allies, the\npower of both the unions and Proletkult were seriously curtailed—although that\nof the Cheka, or secret police—not so much.[95](part0015.html#ch1ft-95)\n\nLike the French Revolution before it, the Russian Revolution called for an\nenlightenment, and like that earlier one, it was to be about not just\nparticular ideas but new modes of practicing knowledge. Bogdanov thought a\nspecifically proletarian encyclopedia a worthy project, to redact the sum of\nexisting knowledge with a new kind of reader in mind.\n\nBogdanov’s most ambitious plan for Proletkult was in higher education, and for\na brief period he managed to organize a program along the line of his empirio-\nmonism and tektology. In 1919 the Proletarian University opened with 450\nstudents. It was based on the experiments of the Capri school, and had some of\nthe same teachers. It was aimed at adult students, and stressed the equality\nof teacher and student. It offered a concentrated curriculum that included the\nbasics of both social and natural sciences. Its goal was not just to transmit\nknowledge but to transform selves. It was not so much a liberal arts college\nas a social arts college, seeking close alignment with the workplace rather\nthan distance from it.\n\nBut with the eclipse of Proletkult, this too was taken from him. Bogdanov kept\nsome of his academic and administrative posts, but the proletariat was not to\nhave its own independent mass organization. Like many other non-Bolshevik\nintellectuals of the left who had managed to stay out of the hands of the\nCheka, at least for now, he was exiled in the university.\n\nProletkult artists and writers are not as well remembered as other currents\nfrom the heady early years of the Soviet Union.[96](part0015.html#ch1ft-96)\nMuch of what Proletkult achieved is still buried in the archives, waiting for\nthe moment when a collective and common culture can recognize its own\nprecursor. In the meantime, there is at least one writer who emerged out of\nProletkult whose work is undeniably great in that recognizably bourgeois\nform—the genius. The work of Andrey Platonov does not mark the achievement of\na new organization of perception and communication (although as we shall see,\nhe proposed one). But he does at least open the door to a new practice of it\nby his particular example. Platonov is what could be made out of the ruins of\nwhat Bogdanov proposed for Proletkult.\n\nWhile Bogdanov was not to get his own university, his plan for how to organize\nit, and how it might train the proletariat for the work of this world,\nremains. And it is still a striking model of how to organize labor and\nknowledge for interesting times—such as our own. Bogdanov’s most extraordinary\nachievement, however, was his tektology. It is a way of organizing knowledge\nfor difficult times, such as the times of total war, revolution and civil war\nthat Bogdanov experienced, and perhaps also for the strange times likely to\ncome in the twenty-first century, courtesy of the Carbon Liberation Front.\n\nThe labor point of view advances along three axes. The first is empirio-\nmonism, a détournement of philosophy aimed at finding in it some practices of\norganization. The second is proletkult, and the organization of labor through\nthe affective attractions of culture. And the third is tektology, and the\norganization of the nonhuman world—to which we now turn.\n\n[FROM DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM TO TEKTOLOGY](part0005.html#sec-7)\n\nBogdanov belongs to that generation whose thought responds to the shock of the\nGreat War, when “the command of the most insignificant individual … directed\nmillions of people into an unprecedented hell of iron and dynamite\n…”[97](part0015.html#ch1ft-97) He served as an army doctor during the war. A\ndistressing time, and not least because his training was mostly in psychiatry,\nnot in cauterizing the bloody stumps of severed limbs. Experience taught\nBogdanov what a crude form of organization the military was in his day.\n\nBogdanov: “The world war turned out to be the greatest school of\norganization.”[98](part0015.html#ch1ft-98) He had written his _Empirio-monism_\nvolumes before and after the 1905 revolution. His second great series of\ninquiries, the _Tektology_ , began in 1913 but received a great impetus from\nthe war and the 1917 revolutions.[99](part0015.html#ch1ft-99) And just as he\nhad summed up his earlier inquiries in _Philosophy of Lived Experience_ (1913)\nso too his inquiries in tektology resulted in the synthesis of _Essays in\nTektology_ (1921). The former is a philosophical program for the revolution to\ncome; the latter is an organizational program for a revolution that has come\nto pass.\n\nBogdanov thought that the stalemate produced by the February 1917 revolution\nbespoke a social formation with only a rudimentary organizational capacity.\nEven on the left, the differences among the rival forces created a deadlock\nthat could only be resolved by force. Thus the _Tektology_ is a program for a\nhigher level of organization. If such abilities were not to be found within\nthe Bolshevik state, then Bogdanov could at least formulate a program for\nhigher education that might one day achieve it. He was not without success,\nfor “Bogdanovites” populated key economic and technical bureaux until the time\nof Stalin.[100](part0015.html#ch1ft-100)\n\nThe word _organ_ , from the Greek via the Latin _organum_ , can mean a tool,\nbut also a part of the body. The seed of Bogdanov’s thought is contained\nwithin the metaphorical leap of this primary term. A tool is an external organ\nof a body; an organ is an internal tool of a\nbody.[101](part0015.html#ch1ft-101) And as to what then defines a body, when\nits organs can be outside and tools can be inside—that then gets rather\ninteresting. “If several workers work at one machine, then as far as their\nsystem of collaboration is concerned, their relation to this machine, which\nbinds them together, is an internal connection of the system, although this is\na relation to a spatially external object.”[102](part0015.html#ch1ft-102) What\nis inside and outside a system can be different to what is inside and outside\nan object or body. As we shall see, troubling kinds of fetishism can arise out\nof perceiving the body and not what organizes behind its appearance.\n\nBogdanov conceived of organization very broadly, even if part of the impetus\nwas his particular experiences of it: “splits in organizations which occur in\nthe political and cultural life of our epoch, which is full of contradictions,\nwould probably be less frequent, if the leaders always clearly understood that\nin a partial and temporary separation is inevitably concealed a tendency\ntoward a deeper and irreversible one.”[103](part0015.html#ch1ft-103) It’s an\nobservation which could apply to the split between Mensheviks and Bolsheviks,\nor the further splitting of the Bolsheviks between Lenin and Bogdanov, both of\nwhich proved irreconcilable divergences.\n\nIn the cultural and scientific domains, Bogdanov wanted to equip the\nproletariat with the courage and the skill to understand the given world and\nrealize its capacity to transform both that world and itself. Even before the\nOctober Revolution of 1917, he saw power not just as a matter of insurrection\nand seizing or smashing the state. His abiding interest was in the “fate of\nforms,” their emergence, persistence, and dissolution. Bogdanov was a writer\nin and against his times.[104](part0015.html#ch1ft-104) He was not in favor of\nLenin’s seizure of power in October. He viewed with alarm the militarization\nof the party and state during the civil war.[105](part0015.html#ch1ft-105)\n\nThis stems from the different relation Bogdanov and Lenin had with the\nproletariat. If, as Gorky put it, the worker was to Lenin what iron ore was to\nthe ironworker, Bogdanov was fascinated by the flux of collective _affect_ :\n\n> their strength now crystallizes into an unexpectedly mighty, triumphant\n> transport, now spreads and dissipates into an elemental apathy; at times the\n> success of the boldest plans is achieved with astounding ease, at others it\n> is gained only through the most stubborn and intense efforts. Because of the\n> changeability and instability of the environment, our politician develops a\n> point of view and methods which include shades of utopianism and\n> adventurism.[106](part0015.html#ch1ft-106)\n\nThis might be partly self-criticism, but may also be directed at Lenin, who\ntook the shift of the masses toward the Bolshevik position in late 1917 to be\nan historical alignment rather than a situational convergence.\n\nBogdanov’s was quite a different way of thinking to Lenin’s partisan splits\nand political leaps: “The working class carries out the organization of things\nin its labor, and the organization of its human forces in its social struggle.\nIt must connect the experience of both fields into a special ideology; namely,\nthe organization of ideas. Thus, life itself makes the proletariat an\norganizer of a universal type, and the organizational point of view is a\nnatural and even necessary tendency for it.”[107](part0015.html#ch1ft-107) The\nonly difference between political and economic organization is that the latter\nis usually more predictable.\n\nThe _Essays in Tektology_ are the intellectual component of Bogdanov’s quiet\nstruggle within the revolution over its fate, and as such are a discourse on\nforms. Tektology, he said, is “consciously\npractical.”[108](part0015.html#ch1ft-108) Bogdanov:\n\n> Assume that in this case some sensitive and experienced political figure has\n> captured the essence of the situation by the _analogies_ which he knows\n> personally from life or history. But he is able to transmit to others\n> neither his knowledge as a whole nor his practical sensitivity, and,\n> therefore, his conclusions are not convincing to others. And, perhaps, the\n> most vital elements would continue to expend their energies in the wrong\n> direction, against the turning point of the wheel of history. Only a\n> scientific organization of experience permits a real proof of such\n> conclusions.[109](part0015.html#ch1ft-109)\n\nBogdanov’s aim was not a “scientific socialism,” but a socialism of science.\nBased not only on his own experience but on extensive reading in the general\nscientific literature available at the time, _Essays in Tektology_ is\nessentially a pedagogy in how _forms_ emerge, evolve, interact, and decay.\nBogdanov treats form as a category entirely independent of scale: “Is it\nreally possible that the same laws can be applied to combinations of cosmic\nworlds and biological cells, living people and etheric waves, scientific ideas\nand energy atoms?”[110](part0015.html#ch1ft-110) He sees exactly this\nmetaphorical work of substitution as an organizing act in itself. It is a\nprototype of the organizational view of the universe. Tektology first proposes\na metaphorical jump from one scale or form of organization to another.\n\nMetaphor is the tektology of the everyday, a movement in language that\nrecognizes the connection and relation of all things, but it has to be subject\nto verifiable experiment. While more positive about metaphor than Mach,\nBogdanov is aware of the possibility that the substitution of ideas from one\nscale of organization to another that abounds in tektology might be no more\nthan metaphorical.[111](part0015.html#ch1ft-111) Old habits of thought can\nlead to false analogies. A bee hive is not presided over by a “queen,” for\ninstance. Nevertheless, language arises out of communal labor, and reason\narises out of language. Language is where reason\n_works_.[112](part0015.html#ch1ft-112) So one of the methods of tektology is\nto trace metaphor back to the process of its production.\n\nTektology can also speculatively draw organizational principles out of the\nparticular sciences. “The methods of all sciences are for tektology only modes\nof the organization of material supplied by\nexperience.”[113](part0015.html#ch1ft-113) Tektology is not a philosophy but a\nmethod of organization. It is a very different idea to that of setting up some\nversion of “dialectical materialism” as the universal guarantor of particular\nknowledge practices. Nevertheless, tektology does have some basic operating\nassumptions, crystallized out of scientific, political, and everyday life\nexperiences—not least of its founder.\n\nNature is the first organizer, and the human is just one of its organizational\nproducts. Everything is organized in some manner and in some degree. “Complete\ndisorganization is a concept without meaning. It is, in reality, the same as\nnaked non-being.” Once we break through the “membranes of fetishism,” we\ndiscover that “mankind has no other activity except organizational activity,\nthere being no other problems except organizational\nproblems.”[114](part0015.html#ch1ft-114) And indeed, there is no more useful\nway of thinking the human than as a self-organizing population.\n\nWhen the whole is more than its parts, there is organization; when there is\nless, there is disorganization. Bogdanov’s concept of organization excludes\nthe positing in advance of a purpose, which he defines as a fetishism.\nOrganization is as organization does. There are no goals or gods. Tektology\n“is just as alien to morals as it is to\nmathematics.”[115](part0015.html#ch1ft-115) Mathematics is not ontology;\ntektology is not theology. Rather, it struggles against the residues of\nPlatonism old and new, ontological and theological.\n\nTektology diagrams organizational forms and situations, but there are only\nparticular organizations. There’s no prior unity or ultimate synthesis, no\npermanent harmony that they subtend or intend. Not even the revolution can\nforge a unity of the disparate natural and social forms as if by fiat. Even\n_Red Mars_ has an imperfect way of organizing labor and nature, which can’t\nprevent the exhaustion of fossil fuels or the attendant effects of the Carbon\nLiberation Front. For Bogdanov, a political revolution is not the solution to\nanything. It merely enables the problem of organization to be posed. There can\nbe no victory over the sun.[116](part0015.html#ch1ft-116)\n\nMarx showed how private property and the wage relation turn particular and\nconcrete labors into abstract labor.[117](part0015.html#ch1ft-117) Concrete\nlabors interact with nature and each other in particular ways, but are\nsubsumed into the same commodity form. The commodity form is not the only form\nwith which to organize the concrete via the abstract. There is another way\nthat concrete labors are connected, and it is via the transfer of techniques.\nSteam power, for example, arose in one branch of industry (mining) and was\ntransferred to others. Just as there is technology transfer, there is also\n_tektology transfer_. Forms of organization can migrate from site to site.\nTektology is among other things a pedagogy for this other practice of\nsynthesis, outside of the wage relation and the commodity form. Tektology’s\nmovement is “towards a monism of organizational\nexperience.”[118](part0015.html#ch1ft-118)\n\nTektology “was excluded from the minds of the old classes by the divisibility\nof their existence and the separateness and one-sidedness of their\nexperience.”[119](part0015.html#ch1ft-119) Once the bourgeoisie is surpassed,\nand with them the fetish of market competition within relations of exchange as\nthe sole recognized organizational principle, tektology can begin in earnest.\nThe bourgeois thinks in terms of the profit on an investment in competition\nwith others; the worker thinks about the enjambment of his or her labor with\nthose in the adjacent lines of the labor process. This for Bogdanov is the\nbasis in everyday life for the organizational outlook. All that comes from\nwithout is the pedagogy for realizing what the worker already knows.\n\nThere is a pessimism in Bogdanov that is sometimes lacking in his Proletkult\nfollowers. Full organization is not possible, and “there is no absolutely\nharmonious combination.”[120](part0015.html#ch1ft-120) While organizational\nforms can be improved with conscious study and practice, they are not\nperfectible. Red Mars has in the end to face up to extinction (and does so in\nhigh-phallic style by sending the “seeds” of its culture off on rockets into\nspace). There’s a note that pervades Bogdanov’s writing where he appears as a\ndetached observer of his own fallibility: “Sometimes it is possible in the\nsame system to observe factually all the transitional steps from the higher\norganization to the deepest disorganization; as happens, for example, with the\ngradually unfolding quarrel between close collaborators or between\nspouses.”[121](part0015.html#ch1ft-121)\n\n“The basic significance of tektology lies in the most general statement of\nquestions.” It refuses the unstated demand of the Leninist revival in the West\nof the twenty-first century, which repeats Mao’s slogan “put politics in\ncommand” but means by it “put philosophy in command,” and takes philosophy to\nbe the language of an ideal state, if not to come, then at least legible in\nutopian moments such as that of 1917. “Tektology rejects as fruitless\nscholasticism the … philosophical theory of cognition which aims to\ninvestigate conditions and modes of cognition not as vital, organizational\nprocesses among other processes, but abstractly, as a process which differs\nessentially from practice.”[122](part0015.html#ch1ft-122) A materialist\nphilosophy is a contradiction in terms, for as philosophy its materialism\nremains contemplative. Tektology, as a monist approach to knowledge, organizes\nit. Materialist philosophy is new wine in old bottles; tektology seizes the\nbottle factory and makes it a cooperative.\n\nIdeologies are not so much “false consciousness” as the “true” limited\nconsciousness of particular modes of organization. For example, dualist\nbeliefs, which separate spirit and matter, are org-charts to authoritarian\npower, which separates the leader from the led.[123](part0015.html#ch1ft-123)\nOr, to give another example: the doctrine of marginal utility, based on the\nsubjective evaluations of atomized units, diagrams the possessive\nindividualism of the market economy and private property. And while he was\nhardly explicit on the topic, one might imagine that Bogdanov perceived the\nBolshevik faith in sacrifice in the name of history as an accurate ideological\nmap to an authoritarian state embarking on a period of primitive accumulation\nin the context of a hostile peasantry, an exhausted working class and\nsurrounded by imperialist enemies.\n\nViewed via tektology, the labor theory of value is not true where marginal\nutility is false, it is rather a form which anticipates a different kind of\norganization. All those categories that economists—even progressive ones—find\nsuperfluous, such as surplus value, use value, and labor power, point to the\nintractable externality within and against which any economic organization\ntries to contend.[124](part0015.html#ch1ft-124)\n\nCall it “nature,” but it is a nature that can only be known through particular\norganizational forms and processes. “For tektology the unity of experience is\nnot ‘discovered’ but actively _created_ by organizational\nmeans.”[125](part0015.html#ch1ft-125) An ideology is a mode of substitution\nspecific to a mode of production. Bogdanov finds the roots of this\norganizational approach to ideology in Marx, “but Marx did not posit the\nquestion in a general form.”[126](part0015.html#ch1ft-126)\n\nMarx at least puts three related things on the agenda: the problem of the\norganization of collective labor, the problem of social needs, and the problem\nof nature’s intractability. Marx’s thought is relentlessly metonymic, showing\nhow parts emerge out of wholes and are made back into parts of a transformed\nwhole. His thought is horizontal and historical. Bogdanov’s thought is\nrelentlessly vertical and metaphorical, jumping from one whole to another,\nshowing how one whole differs from another.[127](part0015.html#ch1ft-127)\n\nThe result is strange and beautiful sentences, worthy of Platonov, such as:\n“Conjunction is the assimilation of nourishment which sustains an organism and\nof poison which destroys it, soft embraces of lovers and mad embraces of\nenemies, congress of workers in the same trade and a close fight of\nantagonistic detachments.”[128](part0015.html#ch1ft-128) In so many respects a\n“bad Marxist,” Bogdanov has the singular merit of opening up a whole dimension\nthat is present in a subordinate way in Marx’s thought. His is a non-standard\nMarxism in that it addresses a set of phenomena that includes what Marxism is\ntraditionally thought to cover within a larger domain, but not in the form of\na dialectical materialist philosophy.\n\nMarx: “Capitalist production … only develops the techniques and the degree of\ncombination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining\nthe original source of all wealth— _the soil and the\nworker_.”[129](part0015.html#ch1ft-129) Bogdanov might add two things to this.\nFirst, the undermining of the wealth of the soil is obscured for a time by the\nundermining of the worker. The depletion of the soil—the Phosphorous\nLiberation Front—emerges only belatedly as a problem for capitalist\norganization. The solution came firstly by way of “guano imperialism,” and\nthen through the development of the chemical\nindustry.[130](part0015.html#ch1ft-130) The molecular elements stripped from\nthe soil are replenished from elsewhere, at least for a time, and yet the\nmetabolic rift continues.\n\nSecond, Bogdanov’s concept of these undermining forces operates in a more\nabstract way. An organization is only as durable as its weakest component.\nThat which disorganizes it could even be molecular. “People … are capable of\nthe collective creation of fortresses which can withstand any living enemies\nbut they are not yet able to guard themselves against geological and, even\nless so, against cosmic crises. We must, therefore, study the question within\nthe limits of its relative solution.”[131](part0015.html#ch1ft-131) If social\norganization is weakened by the Phosphorous Liberation Front at one moment, it\nmay be the Carbon Liberation Front, or the Nitrogen Liberation Front, at\nanother. The point is not this or that constraint, but that organization has\nto be thought more generally in terms of such constraints. Marx:\n\n> Large landed property reduces the agricultural population to an ever\n> decreasing minimum and confronts it with an ever growing industrial\n> population crammed together in large towns; in this way it produces the\n> conditions that provoke an _irreparable rift in the interdependent process\n> of the social metabolism_ , a metabolism prescribed by the natural laws of\n> life itself.[132](part0015.html#ch1ft-132)\n\nIn the Russia of Bogdanov’s time, shifting the population from agriculture to\nindustry seemed an intractable problem. In the twenty-first century, when the\nglobal urban population may now outnumber the rural for the first time, talk\nof “large towns” rather than a _planet of slums_ seems\nquaint.[133](part0015.html#ch1ft-133)\n\nStill, in his own way, Bogdanov grasped the problem of the _metabolic rift_\nbetween economy as organization and nature as environment, as his fable of the\nMartians makes evident. Tektology was meant to be a design practice for\norganizing organization, conceived under very real conditions of scarcity and\ndisorganization, but under no illusions that a rosy and harmonious future lay\nahead. The Anthropocene makes Bogdanov our contemporary, and the tektology\nworth a closer look.\n\n[TEKTOLOGY AS METAPHORIC MACHINE](part0005.html#sec-8)\n\nAt the core of tektology is a handful of concepts: environment, conjunction,\nlinkage, ingression, disingression, boundary, crisis, selection, equilibrium,\negression and degression. There is always an _environment_ : Bogdanov brackets\nit off at first to simplify the exposition, in which the primary term is\n_conjunction_. Before systems can interact, merge or destroy each other, or in\nshort for there to be any kind of tektology, there is first their conjunction.\nSystems mesh at the margin. Nothing is entirely discrete. This is the basic\nprinciple of Bogdanov’s monism.\n\nThe breaching of a _boundary_ starts a conjunction: “revolution is … a breach\nin the social boundaries between various classes … ; the boiling of water, a\nbreach of the physical boundary between the liquid and its atmosphere; the\npropagation of a living cell, the creation of a vital boundary between its\nparts which acquire independence; death a breach in the living bond of an\norganism …”[134](part0015.html#ch1ft-134) Cooking is a conjunction of fire and\nwater, labor is a conjunction of “the tender cells of the brain” with\naggregates of steel. It is even “possible to coordinate the efforts of two\nworkers who happen to be at the two opposite sides of the earth” by means of a\n“sufficient number of telegraphic stations.”[135](part0015.html#ch1ft-135)\n\n_Linkage_ is the forging of connections between the elements of different\nsystems, in the zone where they overlap. _Ingression_ is the formation of a\nnew system out of that linkage. _Disingression_ is the decline of the\nconjugated system, a situation where these systems “mutually paralyze each\nother.”[136](part0015.html#ch1ft-136) An _equilibrium_ is the stabilizing of a\nboundary between the two disingressive systems, such as the front line between\ntwo armies (and it is entirely characteristic of Bogdanov to think of two\ncontending armies as one system). A _crisis_ appears where the linkage of\nsystems produces a disequilibrium.\n\nBogdanov wants to broaden the meaning of the term _selection_ both toward\nevents in the non-living world and events in human\nculture.[137](part0015.html#ch1ft-137) All of these are domains for “natural\nselection,” although not of the same kind. There is selection when the climate\nchanges, as some species perish and others thrive. There is selection when a\ntown catches fire, as the stone buildings survive and the wooden ones burn.\nThere is selection in the way the awn on an ear of barley enables it to not\nonly stick to but work its way up the sleeve of a peasant walking across a\nfield.\n\n_Conservative selection_ governs the preservation or destruction of an\norganization in relation to an environment, where that environment is\nunchanging. Environment here means the “totality of the external influences\nunder which a system finds itself, but taken exactly in relation to\nit.”[138](part0015.html#ch1ft-138) Where the organization survives, it is in\nequilibrium with its environment. But there are few, if any, unchanging\nenvironments, so the concept is a stepping-stone to the idea of progressive\nselection and of dynamic equilibrium, or the preservation of forms in changing\nenvironments.\n\n_Progressive selection_ is a change in the number of elements in a system that\nmaintains a dynamic equilibrium with a changing environment. For instance, a\ndrop of dew on a leaf is exchanging molecules of water with the atmosphere.\nUnder certain conditions of temperature, pressure, and humidity, the molecules\nlost from the drop and those adhering to it are the same. If this was\nmaintained, then it would be a situation of conservative selection. But all of\nthese variables can change, and with them the exchange of molecules between\nthe drop and the atmosphere. Progressive selection prevails, and from the\npoint of view of the droplet, its effect can be positive or negative. It can\neither add or lose elements from its system. Moreover, the effect is not\nmerely quantitative. If the droplet is diminishing, its form becomes more and\nmore ovoid; if it is growing, it becomes less ovoid and flattens. If it grows\nsome more, then the conjunction of water vapor within the liquid droplet,\nlinking the new molecules with the existing form, may result in a\ndisingression, where a boundary forms and the droplet splits in two.\n\nBogdanov anticipates those like Franco Moretti who find evidence for a process\nof selection working also in cultural forms. A culture retains those ideas\n“which correspond to the permanent and common conditions of its\nlife.”[139](part0015.html#ch1ft-139) The domain of culture operates according\nto parallel processes of selection as other domains, although it has its own\nspecific forms of tektological movement. “Cognition operates with complexes\nwhich are much more plastic; and its field, which has as its base the same\nfield of physical labor, expands much faster and easier. Therefore it develops\nits chain of ingressions correspondingly faster and easier … cognition has\nlong ago arrived at the idea of a continuous connection of all that exists, at\nthe idea of a ‘universal ingression.’”[140](part0015.html#ch1ft-140) Culture\nopens toward the totality. But it does so in a rather open-ended way.\n\nTektology as organized labor experiments with the poetic substitutions of\nuniversal ingression, to propose social and technical forms, from among which\nhistory will select. This was the program intended for the Proletkult labs,\nand it might not be a bad one for twenty-first-century design practice either.\nIt begins with a kind of détournement of existing forms, then experiments with\ntheir application in other domains, before testing out prototypes in\nsituations where users select the most useful and discard the least\nuseful.[141](part0015.html#ch1ft-141)\n\nWhat is selected for in the life of organizing ideas is what in the past has\nenabled collective being to survive. Nothing guarantees that such ideas have\neternal survival value, and in any case selection works negatively. Images,\nmetaphors or concepts are preserved “which correspond to the permanent and\ncommon conditions of its life, and those disintegrate and disappear which are\nin opposition to them; this is the selection of social\ncomplexes.”[142](part0015.html#ch1ft-142) Even the permanent and common\nconditions of life can change, however. The question remains of how ideas that\nin the past were selected out might be tried again under changed conditions.\n\nThe main question for Bogdanov is: how to build a program of knowledge\noriented not only to survival but to growth in organizational capacities in\nrelation to an environment. Particularly problematic here is that one can’t\nalways know in advance where the environment is going to make itself felt.\n“The total stability of a system in relation to its environment is evidently a\ncomplex result of the partial stabilities of its various parts in relation to\nthose influences which are directed against\nthem.”[143](part0015.html#ch1ft-143)\n\nEducation based on the assumption of conservative selection can specialize to\nmeet what it knows to be the challenges of maintaining equilibrium in a given\nenvironment. But “conservatively formed organisms are stable only in a\nconservative environment.”[144](part0015.html#ch1ft-144) If the relation to\nthe environment is one of progressive selection, it is much less easy to\npredict the points at which equilibrium might fail. “What can these hothouse\nplants put in opposition to the severe blows of actual\nreality?”[145](part0015.html#ch1ft-145) A different kind of knowledge is\ncalled for, one more flexible and adaptable, which can meet the challenge to\nsurvival at any point.\n\nBogdanov thought that the “replacement of conservative social structures by\nstructures carrying the seeds of progressive development” calls for new kinds\nof knowledge:\n\n> when comparing two different political or cultural organizations existing\n> within the frame of the same society, it is possible to conclude that one of\n> them is structurally better adapted than another, i.e. more structurally\n> stable. But if social conditions undergo an unusual change, such as a\n> revolution, war or economic crisis, then the correlation will generally turn\n> out to be different, sometimes quite the\n> opposite.[146](part0015.html#ch1ft-146)\n\nAnd probably not knowable in advance, outside of historical praxis.\n\nWhat is revealed in the moment of victory in 1917 is for Bogdanov quite the\nopposite of what Bolshevik optimism expected to find there. “Capitalism with\nits crises provides a mass of examples of hidden contradictions which\naccumulate under conditions of ‘prosperity.’”[147](part0015.html#ch1ft-147)\nUnderneath the quantitative expansion of capital are underlying\nvulnerabilities. It’s a system built on the assumption of conservative\nselection, which has specialized to meet predicted challenges. It isn’t\nprepared for some rather less predictable ones that war and revolution might\nuncover.\n\nIn theory at least, the victorious proletariat of 1917 no longer confronts the\nbourgeoisie as a class, but confronts another boundary. The environment with\nwhich it has relations appears in a new form.\n\n> The entire environment of life on earth, the entire environment in which\n> mankind acts and evolves, with its usual amplitude of fluctuations in the\n> various conditions of its astronomical, atmospheric and other cycles, may be\n> considered as limitedly-changeable; and this means exactly the environment\n> in which changes are scientifically considered in advance, either in their\n> totality or in broad summary conditions.[148](part0015.html#ch1ft-148)\n\nIf the revolution really is the moment of proletarian victory, then those\nboundaries that are both biospheric and molecular at the same time could come\ninto view—and at the time still appear to be limitedly changeable.\n\nScience and labor together confront the problem of identifying and\nrefashioning the weak points in the interaction of social and natural systems.\nWhat changes is that flexibility is needed not just for anticipating and\nhealing internal ruptures within the social, but for ruptures between the\nsocial and its external conditions of existence, and not always at sites that\nare known in advance. This is the field of operation of tektology.\n\nThe Soviet Union of the civil war period found itself in an environment of\nprogressive selection. Social relations came apart at the most unexpected\nplaces. Everything had to be learned again. One of the main challenges was\nfamine. Bolshevik boot-strapping fell back to earth repeatedly on the\ninability to make much improvement on the struggle to extract agricultural\nsurplus from the land, and indeed their policies repeatedly made a bad\nsituation even worse, as Bogdanov had predicted. The reversal of policy in\n1921, when “war communism” was abandoned in favor of the New Economic Policy,\nis a striking example of how quickly the struggle within and against nature\ncan ramify through the whole social organization. Bogdanov: “the chain will\nbreak at its weakest link.”[149](part0015.html#ch1ft-149)\n\nIn _Red Star_ , Bogdanov anticipated the possibility that the weakest link\nwould be not so much energy for organic systems but energy for inorganic ones.\nThe Martians destroyed their forests to fuel their industries, and changed\ntheir climate. While Bogdanov does not foresee human-engineered climate change\nas the likely challenge to equilibrium in the _Essays in Tektology_ , he\ncertainly understands the dynamics of climate as a system and the kinds of\ndisruptions it can cause: “Climate change occurs in a country: it becomes\ncolder. Of the animals and plants inhabiting it, some are able to endure this\nchange and survive; others perish. As a result, the organization of life on a\ngiven territory is regulated in accordance with new\nconditions.”[150](part0015.html#ch1ft-150)\n\nAnimal and plant life are part of a system characterized by both divergence\nand complementarity. _Divergence_ is a refinement of the Epicurean concept of\nthe swerve and a primitive attempt at a concept of a chaotic system. Small\nvariations in initial conditions can lead to divergent transformations of\notherwise almost identical systems. Small variations in otherwise comparable\nstates in the weather produce wildly diverging patterns with a short space of\ntime. Or, over a much larger time scale, plants and animals are two of several\nforms of life that started to diverge from initially small variations on a\ncommon ancestor, starting some 3,500 million years ago.\n\nSelection favors some forms over others, no matter what their origins, and in\nparticular those which form relations of _complementarity_ with each other. So\nit is with animal and vegetable life. These two forms of organism diverged a\nlong time ago, but their relation is one of complementary difference. Plant\nmetabolism requires carbon dioxide as an input and produces oxygen as an\noutput; animal metabolism requires oxygen as an input and produces carbon\ndioxide as an output. Their fates are linked.\n\nBogdanov understands life as part of a self-regulating system, although not\nnecessarily one that will always find equilibrium. The cyclical exchange of\ncarbon dioxide and oxygen:\n\n> forms a basis for complimentary correlations between life as a whole—the\n> _biosphere_ —and the gaseous cover of the earth—the atmosphere. The quantity\n> of carbon dioxide is maintained at a definite, stable level. If, due to the\n> development of animal life, forest fires and also a _discharge of carbon\n> dioxide in volcanic processes or from other_ _sources_ , there is an\n> overproduction of carbon dioxide, then the growth of plants immediately\n> intensifies at its expense, and the surplus is\n> absorbed.[151](part0015.html#ch1ft-151)\n\nAnd vice versa. Remarkable for his time, Bogdanov has some understanding of\nthe biosphere as a system. His struggle for a monist practice after philosophy\nhas all been leading up to this threshold. The concept of the biosphere calls\nfor a new worldview.\n\nPhilosophical monism and the cooperative point of view of labor point Bogdanov\ntoward a symbiotic view of evolution, although in no sense does he see it as\nan intentional or teleological system.[152](part0015.html#ch1ft-152) Rather,\nit is an argument from the principle of selection. Any system that endures is\nlikely to be self-correcting within given parameters, as is the systematic\ninteraction of the atmosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere of earth. “Thus the\nregulation of their quantity by conjunctive couplings between the three\nspheres is a basic condition for the maintenance of a stable, on average,\nlevel of their temperature.”[153](part0015.html#ch1ft-153) In the _Essays_ ,\nBogdanov grasps the carbon cycle, but has now forgotten the possibility he\ncanvassed in _Red Star_ of the destabilizing effect of the Carbon Liberation\nFront.\n\nThe early Soviet Union is a microcosm in which a revolutionary society, no\nlonger bound by the old laws of private property, nevertheless had to confront\n“the cognitive struggle with nature,” or rather struggle(s) with(in) nature,\nand under difficult conditions.[154](part0015.html#ch1ft-154) It is a\nmicrocosm for us in the twenty-first century, for the Carbon Liberation Front\nwill bring with it a widening metabolic rift, destabilization, and reduced\ncircumstances. As for what forms of social organization will emerge, that is\nanybody’s guess. Or perhaps not a guess. Perhaps tektology has a perspective\non the fate of social forms in the Anthropocene.\n\nThis brings us to the concepts of egression and degression. _Degressive_\nsystems are skeletal, often a matter of a waste product externalized, as with\nthe skeletons of animals. It is not always hard like an animal skeleton. A\nsquid’s ink is a degressive system. So too is the surface tension of water.\nInterestingly, so too is writing. Meaning exceeds the sign, but the signs\n“protect from decay the living plastic tissue of mental\nimages.”[155](part0015.html#ch1ft-155)\n\n_Egression_ is a system of sub-systems, one of which predominates. There’s a\nprotocol of interaction, within which one sub-system influences the others\nmore than the others influence it. One could call it leadership, which may or\nmay not be permanent. If the environment remains constant, and all the sub-\nsystems are in the same environment, and one sub-system is better organized\nthan the others, then “egressive difference” can only increase. Power accrues\nto the leading sub-system. “During revolutionary epochs, the process of\nconversion of organizations with an embryonic egression, in the form of a\nhardly noticeable authoritarianism, into organizations of fully expressed\negression, strict authoritarian discipline and ‘firm rule’, appears quite\nfrequently and quite vividly.”[156](part0015.html#ch1ft-156)\n\nEnvironments aren’t constant, however, and equilibrium is usually dynamic. The\nenvironment can become more or less favorable, and in consequence selection\ncan become positive or negative. In either case the better organized sub-\nsystem has the advantage. If the environment is favorable, it is enriched\nfaster. Under negative selection it loses ground less quickly than the other\nsub-systems.\n\nWhat comes together in tektology is molecular and biospheric thought. The war,\nrevolution, and civil war ripped the veil away long enough for Bogdanov to see\nthrough to another way of organizing knowledge and practice. He was no\nenthusiast. He clearly saw the problems the Bolsheviks had set for themselves.\nHe distanced himself from their authoritarian worldview, their new idealisms,\ntheir militarization of everyday life, and their instrumentalizing of labor.\nHe was inclined as they were to champion labor’s struggle in and against\nnature, even though elsewhere in his work he had already developed the concept\nof the biosphere and the feedback loop between the molecular rifts labor opens\nup and the planet as system. The arrest of Bogdanov in 1923 led him to focus\nmore narrowly on scientific work, putting an end to the evolution of his\nlarger frame of thought.\n\n[BLOOD EXCHANGE](part0005.html#sec-9)\n\nBy the time the _Essays on Tektology_ came out in 1921, Bogdanov’s position\nwas a precarious one. Bukharin, under orders, attacked him in print. He was\npacked off on a trade mission to London by his friend Leonid Krasin to keep\nhim out of harm’s way. While in London he caught up on the latest in blood\ntransfusion theory and technology. This was a topic of longstanding interest\nto Bogdanov—his Martians practiced it. He set up a small and rather secret\ngroup to experiment with it upon his return from London. His arrest came in\n1923, when he was accused of leading the opposition group Worker’s Truth.\nWhile his writings may have influenced such groups, he denied all involvement.\nThe secret police interrogated him for two weeks in the basement of the\nLubianka prison.\n\nBy 1924 Bogdanov was conducting experiments in which blood transfusions were\nsimultaneous exchanges between two parties. The idea was that blood was a\ncollective resource of the body, which could in turn be collectivized between\nbodies. The physiological basis of this was shaky. Nor did Bogdanov know\nmodern scientific method. The lack of control conditions rendered his results\nmeaningless. Yet it appears that he really did help Krasin recover from a case\nof anemia in 1925.\n\nKrasin was not the only communist leader who suffered from anemia at the time.\nA veritable epidemic of exhaustion was passing though the Bolshevik\nleadership. Holding a monopoly on state power while sending not just your\nenemies but also your friends into exile or prison came at a cost. The leading\ncircles of the party created their own private healthcare system, in part to\ndeal with this endemic exhaustion. In 1926 Bogdanov got his own institute,\nwhose mission was to develop blood transfusion techniques for sustaining the\nhealth of the party leaders. His institute was not approved in the usual way\nand stood outside the now very extensive scientific apparatus of the Soviet\nUnion. More scientifically rigorous researchers in the field ignored\nit.[157](part0015.html#ch1ft-157)\n\nBogdanov died in 1928 as a result of a blood exchange with a student who had\nan inactive form of tuberculosis. He received a state funeral. Bukharin\ndelivered the eulogy, although the meaning of this was rather\nobscure.[158](part0015.html#ch1ft-158) Having Bukharin preside may not have\nmeant that Bogdanov was accepted as part of the party, but rather that\nBukharin was joining Bogdanov among those who were already excluded from it.\nBy 1929 his institute had been named after him, but had at the same time\nbecome a properly scientific one, and part of the establishment of a modern\nblood transfusion regime. Stalin invested resources in transfusion as part of\nhis mobilization and militarization of the whole of society.\n\nAttempts are sometimes made to make Bogdanov a precursor to Stalin, but this\nis itself a smear campaign of the Stalinist type. It is true enough that when\nStalin was consolidating his power he mobilized the rhetoric of the cultural\nrevolution that sounded a bit like Proletkult. But this was a top-down power\nplay, not Bogdanov’s self-organization of labor from below. In any case,\nStalin quickly abandoned such rhetoric once it had served its\npurpose.[159](part0015.html#ch1ft-159)\n\nIt is also true enough that Bogdanov thought that acquired characteristics\ncould be passed on by an organism to its offspring. But this was a common\nerror among Darwinists even in the early twentieth century. A proper synthesis\nof Darwinian selection with Mendel’s genetics had yet to be thought through\n(and would come, incidentally, from Marxist biologists in both the Soviet\nUnion and Britain). Bogdanov is not to blame for the persecution by Stalin of\nVavilov and other genetic scientists, and the elevation of the fraudulent but\nseemingly “dialectical materialist” work of Lysenko to scientific\nrespectability.[160](part0015.html#ch1ft-160)\n\nThe legacy of Bogdanov lived on not in philosophy or science so much as in\nengineering culture. Some of the leaders of Lenin’s electrification program\nwere Bogdanovites. Platonov, as we shall see, went from Proletkult to hydro-\nengineering to an extraordinary synthesis of the literary and technical\naspirations of the Proletkult movement. While not a major figure in his day in\neither technical or literary circles, Platonov now looms large as not only a\ngreat witness but also a great theoretician of his age.\n\nThat Bogdanov fell out with Lenin does not make him a Stalinist. On the other\nhand, it made him a non-person to the Western Marxists who thought that they\nwere returning to an authentic Leninist thought prior to Stalinist\nfalsifications. The revival of Marxist thought by the New Left, which\nconsolidated the canon of Western Marxism as we now know it, also selected\nagainst Bogdanov. Its interests were largely in grafting political and\ncultural theories onto Marxist political economy, and it looked to Lenin,\nTrotsky, and to Marxist philosophers in the West for the resources for\nthis.[161](part0015.html#ch1ft-161) In the twenty-first century, when of all\nthe liberation fronts it is the Carbon Liberation Front that is ascending,\nperhaps Bogdanov is the point to which to return.\n\nHere our method can itself be a tektological one. For tektology, even\nsuperseded organizations may have their uses. “In this sense, tektology will\npreserve and save for mankind much of its labor, crystallized in the verities\nof the past. Undoubtedly, contemporary verities will also become obsolete and\ndie in their time; but tektology guarantees that even they will not simply be\ndiscarded and will not be converted in the eyes of future generations into\nnaked, fruitless illusions.”[162](part0015.html#ch1ft-162) It’s hard not to\nsee in this statement, poignant given the circumstances in which it was\nwritten, a Bogdanov who is appealing to future readers, appealing, dear\nreader, to you. The _Essays in Tektology_ are science fiction in reverse: not\nthe present writing about the future, but the past writing to the future.\nBogdanov wrote for the Martians, and the Martians are us.\n\nAt its most expansive, tektology makes not only all humans comrades, but all\nthings comrades:\n\n> But what is the origin of the tektological unity itself? The more science\n> develops, the more it is revealed that this unity is nothing else but the\n> result of a genetic unity, that in it is expressed the bond of origin,\n> although this bond is quite remote. It unfolds to the entire universe _of\n> the experience accessible to us_ ; and the formal convergence is being\n> thereby reduced to a more indirect real\n> convergence.[163](part0015.html#ch1ft-163)\n\nThe qualifying clause is quite important. An absolute unity of being can be\nposited as a worldview, and both science and labor discover through praxis the\nparticular tektological forms via which all things embrace and transform each\nother, but a praxis can never be perfected. Our finite nature limits us. It is\nenough of a struggle for our species-being for it to survive those relentless\npressures of selection that would erase it. This might be a particularly key\npoint now that it is our own science, and our own labor, that sets loose the\nCarbon Liberation Front, which makes progressive selection progress at an ever\nfaster clip.\n\nThe tektology can be read as a first, perhaps premature attempt at a _systems\ntheory_. Bogdanov’s systems are curiously less autopoetic than they are what\nDonna Haraway calls sympoetic.[164](part0015.html#ch1ft-164) While systems\ntheory never quite became a science of science, it did spawn a series of\nmetaphors and techniques which migrated sideways from science to science,\nilluminating systems and structures. Tektology is then not so much a failed\nattempt at a science of science as an intuition about a certain kind of\n“sideways” organization of knowledge in the world.\n\nBogdanov thought the great task for collective labor was the organizing of the\nworld. That meant finding methods of coordinating across the division of labor\nother than commodity exchange. What he came up with is a model for a kind of\nexperimental practice where the concepts developed in one labor process can be\nmetaphorically substituted into others, and tested there in practice.\n\nThe labor and knowledge practices of Bogdanov’s time were far too slender an\ninfrastructure for such a tektology. The means simply didn’t exist for\ncomradely sharing of qualitative experiences from particular labors. There is\na certain poignancy in Bogdanov’s death from blood sharing. Neither the\nsharing of biological materials nor the sharing of conceptual materials was\nyet possible. Tektology, like blood exchange, was utopian.\n\nAnd yet, as we shall see in [Part II](part0011.html), the far more advanced\ntechno-scientific infrastructures of the twenty-first century do indeed\nsupport all kinds of substitutions between fields, and not just of a\nmetaphorical kind. In a relatively new field like climate science, it is\ncertainly possible to see echoes of many of Bogdanov’s premature insights—and\nnot least about atmospheric carbon. Not the least reason to restore the memory\nof Bogdanov’s work is that he already anticipated the systematic and\norganizational problems that would confront working people in our time.\n\nWhat of Bogdanov’s other organizing idea: proletkult? Like tektology, it did\nnot come to pass in the Soviet Union. But we do have at least one\nextraordinary instance of what proletkult could have been, in the work of\nAndrey Platonov. Attention to Platonov’s major works, long buried in the\nSoviet archive, can help us think through certain follies to which Marxist and\nother critical theories are still prone, and toward a revised critical\napparatus for the era of the Carbon Liberation Front.\n\nPart of Bogdanov’s originality was to insist that the central tenet of Marx’s\nwork is not dialectics or materialism or the critique of political economy,\nbut the labor point of view. Bogdanov grasped the central role in Marx of what\nDeleuze calls the _conceptual personae_.[165](part0015.html#ch1ft-165) Marx,\nas Bogdanov reads him, thinks capital through the persona of the worker. The\nworker-persona both maps out, and constitutes, in its relation with other\nclass personae, particularly its antagonistic relation to the capitalist-\npersona, the space of Marx’s thought. The worker-persona is not a product of\nthe author’s mind, as the persona and the author are also mutually\nconstituting. Personae are not so much novelistic characters as embodiments of\nconcepts, even though the personae may at the same time have a certain affect\nand a certain appearance that attaches to them.\n\nWhat Platonov will add to this persona of the worker is the persona of the\n_comrade_. He does not simply assume a universality of the worker point of\nview, as is sometimes the case in Marx and Bogdanov. He is interested in the\nstruggle to become comrades together. For Deleuze, personae carry with them\npossible modes of existence. While Platonov writes both appealing and\nterrifying comrades, they are all integral to his thought, which is precisely\nthe thought of the space between these various incarnations of the comrade. To\nunderstand Platonov, then, is to understand what is between comrades as a\nplural but not universal point of view.\n\n\n## [2](part0005.html#ch2)\n\n## [Andrey Platonov: A Proletarian Writing](part0005.html#ch2)\n\n[SON OF PROLETKULT](part0005.html#sec-10)\n\nFamine and war appear on the first page of Platonov’s great (anti) novel\n_Chevengur_. The old woman Ignatevna can cure children of hunger. She feeds\nthem a broth of grass and mushrooms. They fall asleep and never wake up, “dry\nfoam flecked on their lips.”[1](part0015.html#ch2ft-1) She will take an old\nskirt or an iron for her services. There is not a lot to look back fondly on\nfrom the time of the Tsar.\n\nThe peasants leave their village to beg, or for the front. Pavlovich stays\nbehind, living on boiled grass. He makes in wood all the things that used to\nexist in metal. He even makes an oak frying pan. He brings water to the boil\nin it slowly so the wood doesn’t burn. He understands the material constraints\non wants. He listens to a locomotive, off in the distance, but it stops.\n\nEvery page of Platonov contains condensed emblems of the Soviet experience. On\nthe one hand, peasants and workers and their ways, doing and making, and the\nsensations that arise out of their labors. On the other hand, agents of the\nrevolution, some noble idealists, some sinister hacks, and their fantastic\nexhortations. He stages close encounters of these comrades with each other,\nusually far from the center, in the village or the countryside, or the far,\nfar east.\n\nFrom the point of view of the high-minded Leninism of the Soviet state, it is\nlike a game of telephone. What we get is not the governing universals of the\nphilosophy of the center, but how minor characters in the provinces mix signal\nand noise to suit their own situations and experiences. In Platonov we touch\nthat highfalutin language only from beneath. His personal party line is rather\nlike that of the comrade who said to me once that “the party should stick to\nthe working class like shit to a blanket.”\n\nPlatonov was born into the working-class family of a metal worker for the\nrailways in the provincial city of Voronezh. He grew up in one of those raw\ninterzones between the industrial and the agricultural that are characteristic\nof early industrialization.[2](part0015.html#ch2ft-2) As the oldest of ten\nkids, he had to work to help support the family from an early age. He\nsupported the Bolsheviks from the start of the revolution, and was briefly a\nparty member, but a more lasting influence was Proletkult. He became something\nof a provincial success as a journalist, poet and story writer. The local\nProletkult organization even sent him to Moscow for a congress, at which he\nheard Bogdanov speak.\n\nWhile an accomplished writer of stories, Platonov’s most striking works are a\nseries of anti-novels or anti-novellas. Taken together, they are an\nallegorical history of the Soviet Union. _Chevengur_ stretches from the\nrevolution, through the civil war and war communism, to the New Economic\nPolicy of the early 1920s. _Foundation Pit_ tells the story of Stalin’s forced\ncollectivization of agriculture, beginning in 1928. _Happy Moscow_ turns on\nStalin’s 1934 statement, after the completion of the first five-year plan,\nthat “life has become merrier.”[3](part0015.html#ch2ft-3) _Soul_ escapes the\nimminent era of the great purges by traveling east, and confronts the whole\nhistory of the revolution with a fable of its failure and redemption in\nTurkmenistan.\n\nPlatonov’s writings lend themselves to multiple readings. I leave it to others\nbetter qualified to account for his distinctive use of the Russian language,\nhis cosmist or theological themes.[4](part0015.html#ch2ft-4) My reading\nconcentrates on three things, read through three series of figures: his\n_historical allegory_ of the revolution; the _everyday quality_ of that\nhistory; and a kind of _tektology_ that arises from his distinctive method of\nconstructing proletarian prose. In the rather limited sphere of the production\nof writing, Platonov actually pulled off in a minor way something of what\nBogdanov suggested, even if Bogdanov himself would have been rather perplexed\nby the results.\n\nThe first of these three readings—historical allegory—is mediated in turn by\nthree figures, who no doubt literally loomed large over Platonov his whole\nadult life: Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. His play _Fourteen Little Red Huts_\npresents condensed versions of all three. About Marx, the intellectual says:\n“All his life he was looking for something serious and laughing at the current\nnonsense of every event.” The peasant replies: “you’re lying, man of science!\nMarx didn’t laugh at us—he loved us, in advance and\nforever.”[5](part0015.html#ch2ft-5)\n\nThis Marx addresses two classes, hacker and worker, as both critic and savior.\nOne of Platonov’s abiding themes is a Bogdanovite one: who is Marx to the\nproletariat? Marx’s _Capital_ traces an allegorical descent into hell of the\nworker who passes through the factory gates, out of the realm of circulation\nand equality into the inferno of production.[6](part0015.html#ch2ft-6)\nPlatonov’s world is a hell beneath that hell, of non-production, of bare want,\nbut his proletarian is a being that speaks rather than being spoken of,\nopening a fissure in the Marxist canon, between high and low.\n\n_Fourteen Little Red Huts_ is set on a distant collective farm, over which\npresides a scarecrow, pointing into the distance. While this straw-man Lenin\npoints to the remote future, in the near present the “class enemy” steals the\nlivestock and even the children. The collective farm chairperson declares\nthat: “We are poor here, we have no one except Stalin.” Yet as the\nintellectual has already told her: “It’s our fate not to be\nheard.”[7](part0015.html#ch2ft-7) Lenin is present, but has no effect, while\nStalin is absent, and yet his effects are everywhere.\n\nThe second series of three figures through whom I want to read Platonov are\nwitnesses to a quite different disenchantment, that of postwar consumer\ncapitalism: Henri Lefebvre, Raoul Vaneigem, and Guy Debord. Lefebvre\ninaugurates a critique of _everyday life_ and its various alienations. This\ncritique entails “relinquishing the traditional image of the philosopher as\nmaster and ruler of existence, witness and judge of life from the outside,\nenthroned above the masses, above the moments lost in triviality\n…”[8](part0015.html#ch2ft-8) Today’s Leninoid philosophers and the Stalinist\napparatchiks of the past join hands in denying low theory, emergent from\nbelow, and the Marx to be found there who loved us, in advance and forever.\n\nLefebvre’s discovery, or rediscovery, of everyday life takes an even more\npointed form with his apprentice, Raoul Vaneigem: “People who talk about\nrevolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life,\nwithout understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in\nthe refusal of constraints, such people have a corpse in their\nmouth.”[9](part0015.html#ch2ft-9) That might be a perfect epigram for\nPlatonov, with a tad less love, and rather more corpses.\n\nFor all the apparent modernism of his prose, Platonov is the writer of the\nmaterial practice of popular sense-making. Platonov’s method, in a word, is\ndétournement, the collective labor of unmaking from below the language of\nthose above. Platonov’s workaday characters have a naive genius for lifting\nthe seal off official languages, whether of church, state or party, and using\nthem as lubricants for the machinations of their own concerns, even if their\nuse of it is no longer always dialectical. Language is material, but not a\nfinal means with which to grasp other kinds of materiality. Debord: “Whatever\nis explicitly presented as détournement within formulated theory serves to\ndeny any durable autonomous existence to the sphere of theory merely\nformulated.”[10](part0015.html#ch2ft-10) Language is just one kind of\nmateriality among others.\n\nPlatonov describes one of his techniques of détournement in his story “Among\nAnimals and Plants,” his oblique account of the gulag:\n\n> Federov preferred to choose pages at random—now page 50, now page 214. And\n> although every book is interesting, reading this way makes it even better,\n> and still more interesting, because you have to imagine for yourself\n> everything you have skipped, and you have to compose anew passages that\n> don’t make sense or badly written, just as if you too were an\n> author.[11](part0015.html#ch2ft-11)\n\nHere he perfectly describes the _literary communism_ discovered by Lautréamont\nand practiced by the Situationists, which erases a false idea and inscribes in\nits place the correct one. Platonov’s détournement of the socialist realism of\nthe 1930s might not be a bad guide to what is to be done with the capitalist\nrealism that is the only acceptable language of our own time.\n\nThe third reading of Platonov is via our three rebel Bolsheviks of Capri:\nGorky, Lunacharsky, and Bogdanov. As in Gorky, everything in Platonov begins\nand ends in labor. Gorky: “The music of toiling men drew me down the Volga.\nEven now it has an intoxicating effect and I remember very clearly the day\nwhen I first became aware of the heroic poetry of everyday life … My soul was\nbrightened by the desire to spend my whole life in that half-insane rapture of\nwork.”[12](part0015.html#ch2ft-12)\n\nLike Lunacharsky, Platonov thought socialism had to be more, rather than less,\nthan a religion. Lunacharsky:\n\n> To me, the revolution was a stage, inevitably tragic, in the worldwide\n> development of the human spirit toward the “Universal Soul,” the greatest\n> and most decisive act in the process of “God-Building,” the most striking\n> and definite deed in the realization of the program which Nietzsche had so\n> felicitously formulated when he said, “there is no sense in the world, but\n> we ought to give sense to it.”[13](part0015.html#ch2ft-13)\n\nMuch in Platonov reads like a running critique, in and against that sentiment.\nGod-Building is surprisingly easy; actual building is relentlessly hard.\n\nHis relation to Bogdanov is rather more interesting. His key works can be read\nas pressing even further the pessimistic note in Bogdanov: the impossibility\nof designing a _dynamic equilibrium_ of human and natural processes. His is a\nwriting that always returns to the entropic, to the residues that can’t be\nrecycled into a molar narrative line. There are hints in Bogdanov of how\neveryday subjective experience appears from the point of view of tektology,\nbut it is Platonov who pursues the tektology of the everyday to its logical\nconclusions.\n\nPlatonov: “There is a kind of link, some kinship, among burdocks and beggars,\nsinging in the fields, electricity, a locomotive and its whistle, and\nearthquakes—there is the same birthmark on all of them and on some other\nthings too … Growing grass and working steam engines take the same kind of\nmechanics.”[14](part0015.html#ch2ft-14) What ensues is a strikingly poignant\nand subtly molecular account of everyday proletarian life, among rocks,\nanimals, and plants—as comrades.\n\nPlatonov’s early stories and journalism were caught up in the utopian\nfantasies of the technical overcoming of material constraints typical of\nProletkult, if not of Bogdanov. He wrote about cloud seeding to alter the\nweather, and dynamiting a hole through the Urals to warm Siberia. Platonov\nresponded to the practical as well as the utopian side of Bogdanov. In the\nwake of the terrible drought and famine of 1921, Platonov left journalism to\nstudy engineering and work on electrification. In 1924 he was working with\nconsiderable energy on land reclamation projects in his native Voronezh\nregion. His own praxis as an engineer led him to a critique of what Susan\nBuck-Morss calls the _Soviet sublime_.[15](part0015.html#ch2ft-15) Given that\nsimilar plans are one response to the Carbon Liberation Front, both his\nexperience and his writings are pertinent to our time as well.\n\nThe great literary theorist Viktor Shklovsky met Platonov at this time. He has\nlittle to say about Platonov’s character—they didn’t hit it off—but he left a\nmemorable portrait of his work. “All these rivers we studied in our geography\nbooks … do not exist. They are overgrown with rush. If you push the rush\naside, the ground underneath is wet. Platonov dredges the\nrivers.”[16](part0015.html#ch2ft-16) There’s no water, sometimes for forty\nkilometers; the villagers work all night at the well with their buckets. The\npeasants plow their fields using cows. Platonov straightens rivers, drains\nswamps, spreads lime to counteract the acidity of the soil. The dams are made\nof dirt and clay, and constructed in the winter when the ground is frozen.\n“Comrade Platonov is very busy. The desert is advancing.”\n\nPlatonov somehow gets an orchard to flourish. Water flows to the trees down\nchutes on wooden stilts. Oats grow around the trees to prevent the rabbits\nfrom eating the fruit. There’s no motor. The screw pump, of the kind designed\nin ancient times by Archimedes, is worked by hand. Platonov: “Given the\nagrarian over-population of the village and the famine in Voronezh … there’s\nno motor cheaper than the village girl. She requires no amortization.” (Or so\nShklovsky says he says.)\n\nShklovsky: “Platonov understood the village.” His work went well. In 1926\nMoscow summoned Platonov to join the central land reclamation effort. He was\nsent to the restive Tambov region in 1927, but had less success\nthere.[17](part0015.html#ch2ft-17) Back in Moscow, and with Gorky’s support,\nhe became a writer again. His attempt to leave literature, this experience of\ntechnical labor and of the real revolution in the countryside, is part of what\nmakes his return to writing great.\n\nProletkult opens the possibility of writing to Platonov, but technical labor\ntempers Proletkult’s raw enthusiasm with its constant encounters with\nrecalcitrant nature. As Bogdanov had already shown, language overshoots most\nother kinds of material in its malleability. Tektological wholes are not so\neasily made with other stuff. The tragedy of the totality is the recognition\nof the gap that can open between them. Collaborative labor is the work of\nnarrowing the gap, even if it can never be fully closed, rather than making a\nfetish of the difference.\n\nIn his (anti)novellas, Platonov sketches a history of the revolution not so\nmuch from below, as from _below the below_.[18](part0015.html#ch2ft-18) It is\nnot just that the usual bourgeois characters of the novel are absent or in the\nmargins. His characters are barely even proletarian. They are often orphans,\nlandless, wanderers—typical figures of the actual period. Lenin had worn out\nthe working class in revolution and civil war. These déclassé characters were\nthe actual base of the social formation.\n\nPlatonov is the great writer of our planet of\nslums.[19](part0015.html#ch2ft-19) He saw beneath the sheen of socialist\nrealism to the disorganization of labor beneath, like an old mole that\nundermines the surface. His work is like an allegory for what lies unseen\nunder our own capitalist realism. The difference is that socialist realism at\nleast felt obliged to acknowledge the reality of labor as subject if not the\nreality of the object of its labors. Platonov got critical purchase through\nattention to those personae closest to the struggle to wrest a surplus from\nnature.\n\nBogdanov gives us the tragedy of the totality from the point of view of those\nwhose job it is to try to grasp that totality. Platonov sees it from below the\nbelow. He sees the tragedy of attempting and failing to get anything to work\nat all. His is a writing of residues and remainders. The era of the Carbon\nLiberation Front calls for both kinds of work, on the totality and on its\nfailures and fissures.[20](part0015.html#ch2ft-20) Bogdanov and Platonov,\ntaken together, are our contemporaries, then. The revolution they witnessed is\nan allegory of the weird times to come.\n\nBut let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First: a reading of Platonov, through\nthe protocols of historical allegory, everyday life, and tektology, which\nextract from the interplay of his comradely conceptual personae a plurality of\nconcepts and figures for our situation.\n\n[_CHEVENGUR_ AS HISTORICAL NOVEL](part0005.html#sec-11)\n\n_Chevengur_ can be read as two linked (anti)novellas, the first of which is an\nepic historical novel of the war, revolution, and civil war as seen from below\nthe below. The characters are—like Marx’s worker in _Capital_ —conceptual\npersonae caught at the same time within the exogenous struggle of nature and\nthe endogenous struggle within the social\nformation.[21](part0015.html#ch2ft-21) The difference is that there is no\nsocial formation. There is no capitalism, and nothing has replaced it. The\ncomrades struggle to create the base for the dream of Lenin’s\nleap.[22](part0015.html#ch2ft-22)\n\nEarly on in _Chevengur_ we meet with Pavlovich, who lives without music, but\nloves mechanical things. He loves only the finished thing, made by labor,\nwhich had begun its independent existence. “Machines were his people,\nconstantly arousing within him feelings, thoughts and\ndesires.”[23](part0015.html#ch2ft-23) He has discovered all on his own a kind\nof labor that is not alienated—the synthesis of art and work to which\nProletkult aspired. Nature troubles him as something quiet and sad, “some sort\nof forces acting without return.”[24](part0015.html#ch2ft-24)\n\nWhen he finds the child Prokofy begging, his love of machines blows away in\nthe wind. From then on Pavlovich finds it hard to work without love and just\nfor the wages. Tinkering with mechanical things only appears to assuage his\nown sadness, but doesn’t really, as the sadness of the child still exists.\n\nPavlovich is a foster-father to Sasha Dvanov, who also works with him on the\nrailways, but has a different attitude to the technical. “Sasha was interested\nin machines as he was in other moving and living things. He wanted more to\nfeel them, to live their lives with them, than to find them\nout.”[25](part0015.html#ch2ft-25) Dvanov wants to enter into the relations,\nnot the things, and views all relations as parts of tektological wholes. The\nmachinic is not a thing apart for Dvanov, but rather part of our species-\nbeing, a matter of organization.\n\nDvanov is a reader, while Pavlovich learns through his hands. “No matter how\nmuch he read and thought, some kind of hollow place remained ever within him,\nan emptiness through which an undescribed and untold world passed like a\nstartled wind.”[26](part0015.html#ch2ft-26) There is no logos, no logic common\nto word and world, whereby word can grasp world entire and as an object of\ncontemplation. Words are just one of the forms of matter of the world, and\nperhaps even less helpful as a praxis than other kinds, like Platonov’s land\nreclamation work, although that too will reveal its disappointments.\n\nThe war with Germany convinces both Pavlovich and Dvanov of the uselessness of\nthe government, perhaps of all governments. And Pavlovich’s beloved trains\njust seem to make war possible. The machine isn’t free. The revolution is to\nPavlovich the path of least resistance, easier than war. Dvanov’s affective\nexperience of the revolution is a layered one. “In the melody of the bells he\nheard alarm, faith and doubt. These same passions are also at work in\nrevolution, for people are moved not only by cast-iron faith, but by\nshattering doubt as well.”[27](part0015.html#ch2ft-27) A revolution is not\njust a leap of faith.\n\nPavlovich takes Dvanov in search of the most serious party. One party sounds\nlike Mensheviks. They say “happiness is a complicated article, and not in it\nis man’s goal, but rather in historical laws.”[28](part0015.html#ch2ft-28)\nPavlovich prefers the Bolsheviks. “Probably this would be the smartest power,\nwhich would within the year either completely build the world, or else raise\nup such a fuss that even a child’s heart would grow\ntired.”[29](part0015.html#ch2ft-29) Nonetheless, Pavlovich is more skeptical\nthan Dvanov about these Bolsheviks. It was the workers and soldiers who made\nthe revolution. What do we need a party for, he asks, let alone a state? He\nthinks the people can organize itself for itself.\n\nThe Bolsheviks send Dvanov to see if socialism has popped up anywhere of its\nown accord. After all, the people have nothing but each other now. “Dvanov\nremembered various people who wandered among the fields and slept in the empty\nbuildings at the front; maybe those people in fact had already bunched up in a\ngulley somewhere, out of the wind and the government and there they lived,\ncontent with their friendship.”[30](part0015.html#ch2ft-30) Such things\nactually happened. The comradeship of the war and civil war sent many\nlandless, displaced former soldiers and wanderers off to make their own\ncommunes and organize their own lives. Platonov never loses a basic solidarity\nwith that revolutionary structure of feeling.\n\nOne part of Dvanov’s revolutionary feeling comes from Pavlovich, and is\ntechnical in nature, like improved irrigation: “He thought of the time when\nwater would begin to glisten in the dry uplands. That would be socialism.” But\nhe is skeptical about the transformative power of the technical, which aligns\nwith a whole ontology: “Nature had no gifts for creation … it succeeds through\npatience.”[31](part0015.html#ch2ft-31) In history, as in natural history,\nselection erases all that is not fitted to endure. Communism for Dvanov\ncombines raw comradeship in the face of common hardship with the technical\novercoming of scarcity. These turn out to be compatible aims only in certain\nsituations. State and ideology get in the way; machines go off their rails,\nand not everything can be redeemed at once. In Platonov, there is no shortcut\nto enduring happiness.\n\nIn the countryside during a civil war, “where there’s mud we’ve got\npeace.”[32](part0015.html#ch2ft-32) Friction, fog, and sheer distance get in\nthe way. Locomotives collide head-on, while the engine drivers look on\nhelplessly. The new Soviet state loves harvests, and while the peasants now\nhave their land, they prefer to make stills from old machine-gun parts and\nbrew moonshine. Dvanov encourages them to take over the landowners’ estates.\nThere’s more than one civil war going on.\n\nCaptured by an anarchist band, Dvanov is rescued by Kopenkin, who “could have\nset fire to all the immobile property of earth with conviction, so that within\nman would remain only reverence for one’s\ncomrade.”[33](part0015.html#ch2ft-33) He is an old man who had never paid much\nattention to his own life, living on “unreasoned hope” rather than bread. He\nis not the party and still less the government, but a natural force. His mount\nis Proletarian Strength, not a noble charger, more the kind of horse with\nwhich you pull up stumps.\n\nIn his cap is a picture of Rosa Luxemburg, whose portrait he once stood before\nin a district party office. “He had looked at her hair and imagined it as a\nmysterious park …”[34](part0015.html#ch2ft-34) She is to him like a mother,\nand yet also like a woman who died in childbirth. On that day when he first\nsaw her image, he killed a kulak who had incited the peasants to attack a\nBolshevik grain requisitioner. Kopenkin is the book’s queer libido, its cod-\nDon Quixote, but not its central character.\n\nPlatonov dispenses with the residues of what Bogdanov would call\n“authoritarian organization” that adhere to Cervantes. Something keeps Dvanov\nfrom adopting Kopenkin’s quixotic zeal. In a fever, a sick Dvanov’s dreams of\nthings. “Little things like boxes, shards, felt boots, and jackets turned into\nhuge objects of enormous size and poured down on top of\nDvanov.”[35](part0015.html#ch2ft-35) They enter his body. He fears they will\nrip open his skin. The Bolsheviks’ problem isn’t just the masses, it is the\nintractable mass of things. In his madness Dvanov knows this, while Kopenkin,\nin his, does not.\n\nDvanov thinks communism is about getting water onto the steppes, and imagines\nthis, in the spirit of Charles Fourier, as a kind of aesthetic perfection of\nthe biosphere: “Because of the cultivated grain the earth will be shinier and\nmore visible from other planets … and then too the water cycle will get\nstronger and that will make the sky bluer and more\ntransparent.”[36](part0015.html#ch2ft-36) He is still stuck at this stage with\nan image of nature as a thing to be contemplated rather than as a taciturn\nobject against which to labor.\n\nDvanov thinks the revolution is about both subjects and objects, which he has\nlearned from Pavlovich and Kopenkin respectively, but he does not yet know how\nhard it is to organize them, let alone how to organize part-objects or quasi-\nobjects. He learns such things through experience, but tends to be a bit\nliteral minded. A banner quotes Marx: “The revolution is the locomotive of\nhistory.” This only makes Dvanov think of clapped-out old freight\ntrains.[37](part0015.html#ch2ft-37)\n\nTaking metaphors literally is a sort of tektology in reverse. Bogdanov’s\ninterest was in the poetic suggestiveness of processes, of how the sensation\nof one might open up onto the diagram of another. Platonov is more attuned to\nthe difficulties a metaphoric leap encounters when brought back into a\nmaterial practice. The “locomotive” in the slogan “the revolution is the\nlocomotive of history” is already an idealized one. Dvanov, like Platonov\nhimself, is rather more knowledgeable about actual locomotives, which, at the\ntime of the civil war, are in a very poor state indeed.\n\nKopenkin rides into what is not much more than a one-horse village. As an act\nof self-authorized revolutionary justice, he redistributes the nags from the\nrich to the poor peasants. One formerly rich peasant cracks wise: so the\nformer rich, now poor, should get the foals when they are born, from the\nformer poor, now rich. Such subaltern wiliness only enrages\nKopenkin.[38](part0015.html#ch2ft-38) He does not see the futility of\nredistributing such impoverished resources, or that a simple leveling is not\nin itself communism. There can be no equality of heterogeneous things and\nhence no equality of the subjects with which they are inextricably connected.\nThe peasant, more canny than Kopenkin, predicts a failure of productivity.\nThere’s a tension between Kopenkin’s theological desire for equality in\npoverty and Dvanov’s techniques for increasing the total wealth.\n\nLike Quixote, what makes Kopenkin an enduring character is that sometimes his\nmadness works, and yet is still madness. Another village does no plowing\nbecause they are too busy with their meetings. Here Kopenkin’s remedy is\nactually a wise one. He prescribes _even more meetings_. Sometimes the remedy\nwith someone pretending to be ill is not to contradict them but rather to\npersuade them they are really _very_ ill.\n\nThe exhortations of the Bolshevik press don’t much impress Dvanov and\nKopenkin. They are only confused by talk of “Kronstadts of\nexcess.”[39](part0015.html#ch2ft-39) It is perhaps 1921, and the Bolsheviks\nhave put down the mutiny of the revolutionary workers and sailors of\nKronstadt, once the arsenal of the revolution, and yet Dvanov and Kopenkin are\ndeaf to the signals of what it must mean. Kronstadt was a clash between the\ninterests of the working class and those of the state, in which the\nBolsheviks—Trotsky included—sided with the state. It is no accident that this\nis when Dvanov and Kopenkin meet Pashtinev.\n\nThey find him in a forest—perhaps the forest of Rosa’s hair. Pashtinev is a\nmore earthy character than Kopenkin. He thinks the revolution ended in 1919,\nwhen the German working class failed to topple the bourgeois state. He lacks\nKopenkin’s avenging mission, although his communism is, if anything, even more\negalitarian. Of Trotsky, he says: “What comrade is he of mine, if he’s\ncommanding everybody?”[40](part0015.html#ch2ft-40) In Platonov, authoritarian\norganization is continually questioned, from below.\n\nFor Pashtinev it is all over. The law has come: “Armies, governments, and ways\nof life have come and gone, but to the people they always said the same thing\n… ‘Stand up, get back in the ranks, you start work on Monday.’” He lives on\n“volunteer plants.” He alone knows that the land can’t be given to the\npeasants, because “the land is self-made, so that means it’s\nnobody’s.”[41](part0015.html#ch2ft-41) Dissolving the fiction of particular\nprivate properties abolishes with it the more abstract fiction that the earth\nis there for us, to be arraigned around our wants. Pashtinev probes the limits\nof the Proletkult worldview.\n\nA village blacksmith, loyal to his village and an enemy of everyone else,\nexplains: “It’s a sly business. First you hand over the land, then you take\naway the grain, right down to the last kernel … The peasant doesn’t have\nanything left from the land any more except the\nhorizon.”[42](part0015.html#ch2ft-42) The communist horizon: the party\nabolished the heavens, and has not (yet) replaced them. But it has abolished\nthe old base as well, leaving only the distant line between. Ideology is\nswitching polarities, from vertical to horizontal; from earth as a fallen\nimage of the divine, to a present as an imperfect realization of a future. The\nabsolute of the eternal heavens gives way to the absolute of time itself:\nHistory as absolute. In this wavering moment, before socialist realism has\nmade the communist horizon the new Godhead, Platonov’s smith—an intermediary\ncharacter between peasant and worker—still has the capacity to question it.\n\nKopenkin replies to the smith that the peasants want to leave the workers with\nnothing to eat while they make homebrew with the grain. Platonov’s sympathies\nare not with the peasants. This is the other civil war, of town and country,\nover who gets control of the agricultural product. Dvanov and Kopenkin are\nsupposed to be agents of the city in this civil war, but the peasants think of\nDvanov and Kopenkin as neither dangerous nor necessary. They don’t order\nforced labor, and Kopenkin uses state decrees for cigarette papers. They are\nthe self-made revolutionaries of a self-making revolution, remote from St.\nPetersburg and Moscow.\n\nWhen Dvanov goes to the city, it looks to him as if the Whites have taken it.\nNo longer a fortress of the revolution, there is even food in the shops. The\nNew Economic Policy (NEP) is taking effect, even if comrades in grain\nprocurement are still getting killed. But things have not quite gone back to\nthe old ways. “Now all the people knew that it is difficult to grow grain,\nthat a plant lives as tenderly and complexly as a man … People had learned\nmany things previously unknown. Their professions had expanded, their sense of\nlife had become social.”[43](part0015.html#ch2ft-43) At least for the moment,\nthey see beyond the fetishism of the market.\n\nWith food in their bellies, people feel their _soul_ and as a consequence\nparticular appetites return. Elsewhere, Platonov defines soul as “an\nindividual violation of a general trend of reality that is unique as an act\nand for that matter the soul is alive. I apologize for the old terminology—I\ndeveloped a new meaning to it.”[44](part0015.html#ch2ft-44) Soul always exists\nin sufficient quality and quantity. It’s a question of whether surplus life\nenables one to feel it.\n\nIn the city, Dvanov meets up with comrade Gopner, who wonders whether food and\nrevolution can coexist: “we are all comrades only when there is identical\ntrouble for everybody.” Gopner is technically minded, but he thinks machines\nare quantifiable and life isn’t. He has the approved Hegelian language to\nhand: “We’re not objects now, we’re subjects.”[45](part0015.html#ch2ft-45)\nStill, it’s the object world that will be the trouble. The light in the\ndistrict party room pulses. Gopner knows that the drive belt for the dynamo at\nthe power plant is not working smoothly. With no light there’s no Bolshevik\nmeetings. The molecular corrodes the infrastructure of the revolution, which\nis held together by a few skilled workers like Gopner—and Platonov.\n\nWhen told of the NEP, Pavlovich declares: “So it’s a lost cause then.” The\nobjective conditions won’t allow Lenin’s leap, and “what doesn’t ripen in the\ncorrect time was sown in vain.” It is in the context of the apparent retreat\nrepresented by the NEP that they encounter Chepurny, who claims to come “from\ncommunism,” even though to Gopner that sounds like “a village named in memory\nof the future.”[46](part0015.html#ch2ft-46) Constructing socialism is\ndifficult enough on such a shallow base, so Chepurny’s claim to have over-\nleapt it into the communist developmental stage is both crazy and appealing.\n\nIn a détournement of Marx’s restrictively humanist formulae for stepping\ntoward communism, “from each according to his abilities, to each according to\nhis needs,” Chepurny describes communist Chevengur as a place where “the\nblessings of life, the precision of truth, and the woe of existence all arose\nof their own accord in correspondence with their\nneed.”[47](part0015.html#ch2ft-47) These three realms, and the possibility of\nselecting a new tektological mode of their dynamic equilibrium, are Platonov’s\nwhole quixotic quest, and from the revolution to the start of the NEP he\nthought it might just be possible.\n\n[_CHEVENGUR_ AS UTOPIA](part0005.html#sec-12)\n\nThe retreat of the NEP marks a break in the text, where the historical\n(anti)novella breaks off and steps into what Slavoj Žižek calls a “gnostic-\nmaterialist” utopia.[48](part0015.html#ch2ft-48) As in Bogdanov, in Platonov\nit is the failure of revolution which prompts the utopian mode. Chevengur is\nwhere those imbued for life with the comradeship of the civil war can find a\nway to live on in that spirit—a not untroubled affect as we shall see—while\ntown and country realign their interests within that strange NEP-space of\nstate-directed capitalism. What Debord called the _concentrated spectacle_\ngoverning the commodity form on the Soviet plan is close to\nhand.[49](part0015.html#ch2ft-49) _Chevengur_ , and within it the almost-\nutopian place of Chevengur itself, preserves Platonov’s sense of a struggle\nfor another life foreclosed, where life, truth, and matter might evolve\ntogether.\n\nFrom afar, the Chevengurians look like “people on vacation from\nimperialism.”[50](part0015.html#ch2ft-50) For all its apparent placidity,\nChevengur is a product of civil war. The violence there is hardly unique or\nunprovoked. The Whites kill the Reds; the Reds kill the Whites. Some\n“bourgeois” hoard so much grain and salt in their ceilings that they cave\nin—trusting in a superstructure that would not hold such providence. The Reds\narrange a “second coming” for this bourgeoisie, who shall be granted the\nheavens, although not in this life.[51](part0015.html#ch2ft-51) The everyday\nlife of utopia is founded on force, and in this regard it is _exactly the\nsame_ as any other everyday life.\n\nChevengur is a town that ate its scapegoat to share equally in guilt, and now\n“it reeks of some raw god.”[52](part0015.html#ch2ft-52) During the Capri\nyears, Lunacharsky and Gorky advocated God-Building, through which the\nproletariat would come to deify itself. Like George Sorel’s myth of the\ngeneral strike, it was a class-based inflection of Feuerbach and the civil\nreligion of the French Revolution, the doctrine of that Marx who loved us in\nadvance and forever. It does not escape Platonov’s attention that while faith\nis a common bond, it also signals an originary violence; or that idolizing the\nleaping proletariat severed from its material conditions of existence, the\nsubject without the object, is just a kind of fetishism.\n\nChepurny’s communism is more that of the landless than of the peasants:\n“Chevengur doesn’t collect property, it destroys\nit.”[53](part0015.html#ch2ft-53) Chevengurians don’t labor for an abstract,\ninvisible common good, but for “close, comradely people.” Even private family\nrelations seem to have been abolished: “We don’t have wives. All that’s left\nis female companions.”[54](part0015.html#ch2ft-54) It’s the utopia of the\nlandless, the displaced, rather than the utopia of hacker and worker\ncooperation in _Red Star_. In Chevengur, they have mobilized the sun, the\nworldwide proletarian, and they live off the surplus power of the solar base.\nNow that “the soul had been made the main profession,” there’s little to\neat.[55](part0015.html#ch2ft-55) They prefer communism to labor discipline.\nCommunism should be biting; sorrowful, but shared.\n\nBoris Pilniak, Platonov’s friend and collaborator, left his own portrait of\nthe kind of men who might come together in a place like Chevengur:\n\n> Here slept Communists who had been called to duty by war communism and\n> discharged by the year nineteen hundred and twenty-one, men of arrested\n> ideas, madmen and drunkards, men who, living together in a cave and working\n> together unloading barges, sawing firewood, had created a strict fraternity,\n> a strict communism, having nothing of their own, neither money nor\n> possessions nor wives: their wives had left\n> them.[56](part0015.html#ch2ft-56)\n\nNone of the Chevengurians have read Marx. Their communist manifesto has four\ntheses: sun and soil; water and wind. The tektological unity of these elements\nis somewhat abstract. “Chepurny could not bear the mystery of time, so he cut\nshort the length of history by the rapid construction of communism.” The time\nof decay, of disorganization, the natural history of time, is simply erased by\nthe absolute time of the communist horizon. “Dvanov guessed why Chepurny so\nwanted communism. Communism is the end of history and the end of time, for\ntime runs only within nature, while within man there stands only\nmelancholy.”[57](part0015.html#ch2ft-57) In Platonov, as in Bogdanov, there\ncan be no _end of history_ , because natural history does not end. That is the\ntragedy of the totality.\n\nPlatonov writes brilliantly of the natural world of the steppe, with a kind of\nsolar tektology of the effects of summer daylight: “the sun leaned dry and\nhard into the earth, and the earth was the first to falter in the weakness of\nits exhaustion, and began oozing the juices of grass, the dampness of loam,\nand disturbing the entire fibrous expanse of the steppe, while the sun only\ngrew more tempered and strong from its tensed, dry\npatience.”[58](part0015.html#ch2ft-58) And of daylight’s passing: “The sun\ndeparted, releasing the moisture of the air for the grass. Nature became a\ndeeper blue and calm, purged of the noisy solar laboring after the general\ncomradeship of languished life.”[59](part0015.html#ch2ft-59) The Chevengurian\nrevolutionaries could not quite mesh their wants with this world of living and\ndead matter. The earth is not the equal of the sun; life is not the equal of\nthe earth.\n\nNothing was planted in Chevengur for three years, and so the wheat and thistle\npropagate by themselves, and work out their own equilibrium, of three to one.\nThe human and inhuman have not found their relation. Chepurny “touched a\nburdock. It too wanted communism. The entire weed patch was a friendship of\nliving plants … Let the wild grasses grow in the streets of Chevengur, for\njust like the proletariat, this grass endures the life and heat and the death\nof deep snow.”[60](part0015.html#ch2ft-60) But Chepurny’s communism has leapt\nagainst the wind and has not found a way to endure.\n\nThe mark of the impasse in Chevengur is that it lacks women. Chepurny thinks\nthat sex and reproduction are “an alien and natural matter, not a human and\ncommunistic one. Woman was acceptable for the human life of Chevengur in her\ndrier and more human form, but not in her full beauty …” He wants “women of\ncourse, but please … you know … just barely, so there’s just a tiny bit of\ndifference …”[61](part0015.html#ch2ft-61)\n\nFor the Chevengurians, women trouble the boundary between the actual natural\nworld of water, earth, and air agitated by the sun, and the communism of the\nfantastic leap, for which the sun is an emblem but not a tangible and tactile\nforce. The comrades are a rather homosocial lot, perhaps even homosexual:\n“Deprived of families and work … all the sleeping Chevengurians were forced to\nanimate nearby people and things in order that they might reproduce and lessen\nthe life which accumulated in their stuffy\nbodies.”[62](part0015.html#ch2ft-62)\n\nWhen the women finally arrive they are frightened. In the revolution and the\ncivil war, they are used to being abused by men, and always right away. There\nweren’t long speeches first, like here in Chevengur. At best, “they had\nexchanged their bodies, their places of age and blossoming, for food\n…”[63](part0015.html#ch2ft-63) The men realize that the women are orphans too,\nlike them. They want the women to become the mothers and daughters of the men;\nthey want the men to become sons and fathers of the women. They want to end\norphanhood for everyone. But the women don’t really believe the fraternal and\npaternal feelings of the men. Women are the public irony of the eternal\nsphere.\n\nThose gathered in Chevengur are the “miscellaneous,” as they might actually be\ncalled in Soviet administrative language, who have even less than\nproletarians. If the definition of the proletariat is those who have nothing\nbut their own kin, then the miscellaneous are a kind that lack even that. They\nare orphans; they are nobody’s. They had no mother to protect their little\nbodies from the world, and no father to be a “first comrade” and lead them to\nother comrades. Their powerlessness is their indifferent strength. If one can\nkeep living then everything else is still possible.\n\nChepurny is one of two leading communists of Chevengur. The other is Prokofy,\nthe former beggar-boy, who has rather more authoritarian inclinations. For\nChepurny, the party belongs to the proletariat; for Prokofy, the proletariat\nbelongs to the party. “Revolution is our job and our duty,” Prokofy says, “all\nyou have to do is listen to our orders, and then you will stay alive and\nthings will go well for you.”[64](part0015.html#ch2ft-64)\n\nChepurny grasps that “the enemy used to live among us head-on, but we got him\nspit out of the revolutionary committee and now in place of the enemy we got\nthe proletariat, so either they’ve got to be spit out too, or else the\nrevolutionary committee is unnecessary.”[65](part0015.html#ch2ft-65) He\nnaively thinks that Prokofy is still his comrade, and cannot imagine that he\nhimself will be on the side spat out. Only the sinister Prokofy has complete\ninformation about the objects and subjects gathered in Chevengur. He has taken\nan inventory of his future estate.\n\nWhen Dvanov and Kopenkin, Gopner and Pashtinov come to Chevengur, they are\nskeptical. The death of a child shakes all these comradely conceptual\npersonae. Dvanov had only intended to go to Chevengur and then return to\npeople who were barely alive to help them. Gopner quickly sees there’s no\nlabor being performed. Pashtinov thinks the leap was worth taking but it\nfailed. Kopenkin may be a rather idealistic communist, but his Rosa is always\nout of reach, always buried in an alien land. It is a ghost that moves him,\nlike the ghost of Hamlet’s father, only this ghost possesses no paternal\nauthority over him, but is rather a mother and daughter, a lover and most of\nall a comrade.\n\nIt is the evening of Chevengur, and the fall is coming. Still, they labor to\ntry and make it work. Kopenkin harnesses Proletarian Strength to the plow.\nGopner and Dvanov try to improve irrigation. They use oak crosses from the\n“bourgeois” cemetery for building material. While a rather disturbing clay\nstatue of Prokofy has appeared, Gopner and Dvanov merge art and design into a\npractice of the productive object. Some of their inventions are rather\nimpractical. They attempt to generate solar power but it never quite works.\nPlatonov reverses the tenets of _productism_ , perhaps the most radical\nartistic tendency of the time. In Platonov’s version, rather than artists\nbringing the aesthetic to labor, he has workers bringing their labors to the\npoint of becoming art.[66](part0015.html#ch2ft-66)\n\nIn order to protect and not exhaust his communism, Dvanov cultivates the\n_secondary idea_ : “Now he feared the expansion of his calm spiritual\nsufficiency and wished to find another, secondary idea by which he might live\nand which he might spend and use, leaving his main idea as an untouched\nreserve, dipping into it but rarely for his\nhappiness.”[67](part0015.html#ch2ft-67) So he works on irrigation, on food\nsecurity. No matter how spiritual the communist leap of faith, it only lives\non in people’s bodies, and bodies have wants. The secondary idea preserves\nagainst the melancholy that attends the first, whether it be the impossibility\nthen of achieving communism—or the impossibility now of confronting the Carbon\nLiberation Front. The secondary idea does not dream backwards from the\nabsolute time of a future horizon. It works outwards, from a particular\npresent situation, looking for lines out of cramped spaces.\n\nEven Chepurny learns from his new comrades, and not least this concept from\ntektology: “Chepurny had discovered one comforting secret for himself: that\nthe proletariat does not admire nature, but rather destroys it, with labor.”\nNo romantic greening of labor here; _Chevengur_ isn’t pastoral. The problem of\norganizing labor and nature is precisely their difference, their heterogeneity\nto each other. Not least because the time Chepurny foreshortens is the time of\ndisingression and decay. There is only nature without\necology.[68](part0015.html#ch2ft-68)\n\nThis nature is recalcitrant, enervating, unpredictable, only ever partially\nknown, and if known at all, known badly, through the metaphors of the time. It\nhas no ecology, in the sense that it is nature without guarantees. It has no\nnecessary tendency to stability or order, no bias toward homeostasis. Its\nhistory is a history of metabolic rifts, of varied cosmological, geological,\nand biological causes. God is dead, and so too is ecology. Disingression\nawaits. Stabilities are temporary and haphazard organizations. Platonov lacks\neven Bogdanov’s tenuous belief that selection selects for equilibrium.\n\nSerbinov the party bureaucrat arrives, investigating a 20 percent drop in land\nunder cultivation. He is a sad sort, an enervated time-server, and yet he\nwrites in his diary: “Man is not meaning, but a body filled with passionate\nveins, ravines of blood, mounds, openings, satisfaction, and oblivion.” And:\n“History was spawned by a base failure who invented the future in order to\nexploit the present.”[69](part0015.html#ch2ft-69) These insights into want and\ntime are private. Serbinov is like a stone in the river, the revolution\nflowing over him while he stays sunk to the bottom by self-regard.\n\nIn Chevengur the amount of grain growing has actually risen. Chepurny’s\nunitary town plan, which moves the houses about in close formation, had the\nunintended consequence of letting grasses grow in the\nstreets.[70](part0015.html#ch2ft-70) The technical improvements of Dvanov and\nGopner might actually work. But the hint of a possible victory is purely\nlocal. The Chevengurians labor freely for each other, not for the state. It’s\na strange kind of comedy, this season of reconciliation with the world.\n\nThe report to headquarters that Serbinov writes about these happy, useless,\nungovernable people may well be the text of Platonov’s _Chevengur_ : “It had\nturned out intelligently and ambitiously, hostile and sarcastic both toward\nChevengur and the capital.”[71](part0015.html#ch2ft-71) It is not clear\nwhether it is Serbinov’s report or Prokofy’s scheming which is Chevengur’s\nundoing. It is not clear whose soldiers come, although the Chevengurians can\nonly shout “Cossacks! Cadets!”—as if their only enemies could be the\nWhites.[72](part0015.html#ch2ft-72) They kill all the Chevengurians with a\nmachine-like precision. Prokofy is left with an empty town.\n\n[_FOUNDATION PIT_ : IMPOSSIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE](part0005.html#sec-13)\n\nThat dead and living matter might find an alignment with the revolutionary\nideal is a possibility still open in _Chevengur_ , no matter how much violence\nand waste attends the attempt to forge the revolution of everyday life. In\n_Foundation Pit_ such possibilities are foreclosed. Platonov was one of very\nfew writers who had seen first-hand what a disaster Stalin’s forced\ncollectivization was, from travels in the countryside in his technical, rather\nthan writerly capacity. The civil war was finally settled, and at the\npeasants’ expense, in a bloody liquidation.[73](part0015.html#ch2ft-73)\n\n_Foundation Pit_ is a détournement of Zola’s _Work_ and Stalinist “production”\nnovels.[74](part0015.html#ch2ft-74) It is the great work on the intimacy of\nviolence and spectacle. But rather than comfort bourgeois sensibilities in our\nown time, the effect is really the reverse, for the same critique applies now\nas then. This excavated underworld is, if not the foundation of our own world,\nthen of one of its precursors. Capitalist realism is not that different to\nsocialist realism: both are saturated in idealist fantasies about immaculate\ngoals. The difference is that in capitalist realism these are mostly invoked\nto sate private wants, for shiny cars and condos.\n\nSocialist realism had a phantasmal conception of the infrastructures beneath\nits gleaming communist horizon. Capitalist realism’s relation to its\nconditions of existence are no less attenuated. The drought of 2012 obliged\nAmerican farmers to feed their dairy cattle ice cream sprinkles, gummy worms,\nmarshmallows, fruit loops and cookies. These varieties of high fructose corn\nsyrup products were cheaper than the corn American cows would usually\neat.[75](part0015.html#ch2ft-75) Neither socialist nor capitalist “realism”\nhas much to say about the molecular struggle of labor in and against nature,\nalthough socialist realism at least had to acknowledge that labor exists.\n\nMeet the new boss, same as the old boss: Voschev the worker stood still in the\nmiddle of production and thought about a plan for the shared and general\nlife—and so they fired him. He is told happiness will come from materialism,\nnot from meaning, even though he says—playing the game—that if he comes up\nwith a plan for life it will improve “productivity.”\n\nVoschev is, by his own account, “a vain attempt by life to attain its goal.”\nHe is a ragged-trousered Hamlet. His soul has stopped knowing truth. He doubts\nthe necessity of the world. Thought no longer engages the worlds of living and\nlifeless matter in a viable project. He finds a leaf on the ground and puts it\nin his sack. He will keep it and remember it, find out for what it once lived\nand has now perished. He “collected every kind of obscurity for memory and\nvengeance,” as “documentary proof of the planless creation of the\nworld.”[76](part0015.html#ch2ft-76) In a world that really is topsy-turvy,\nwhere truth is a remnant of falsehood, Platonov, like Voschev, creates a\nsalvage-punk practice for gathering the relevant ephemera.\n\nHe goes out into the “speechless existence,” where “only faraway water and\nwind inhabited this darkness and nature, and only birds could sing the sorrow\nof this great substance.” Voschev finds a building site where a small band of\nworkers dig an enormous foundation pit for a future House of the Proletariat.\nThe most energetic of the workers is Chicklin, but even he knows the job is\nprobably futile: “This job’s a killer. And time will eat up all the\nuse.”[77](part0015.html#ch2ft-77)\n\nThe House of the Proletariat, a great superstructure raised over a massive\nbase, is Prushevsky’s idea. He is a Bogdanovite of sorts, who thinks the soul\nis the surplus warmth of life. But is it an inevitable surplus? He tackles the\nrelation between matter, life, and soul with a bit of tektological thinking\nculled from his experience of everyday life: “He could see how the topsoil\nrested on a layer of clay and did not originate from it. Could a\nsuperstructure develop from any base? Was soul within man an inevitable by-\nproduct of the manufacture of vital material? And if production could be\nimproved to the point of precise economy, would it give rise to other oblique\nby-products?”[78](part0015.html#ch2ft-78) Prushevsky does not trouble himself\nfor long. He goes about his work with a sort of tender indifference. He\nconcerns himself only with “eternal matter,” that against which every engineer\nlabors.\n\nSafronov is also a technical worker and also has his doubts. “If one looked\nonly at what lay below, at the dry pettiness of the soil and the grasses\nliving in the very thick and in poverty, then there was no hope in life; a\ngeneral, universal unprepossessingness, along with people’s uncultured gloom,\nperplexed Safronov and shook the ideological directive in\nhim.”[79](part0015.html#ch2ft-79) Unlike Prushevsky he cannot still his soul\nby working only on dead matter. His calculations of nature are turning him\ngray. “He pictured the whole world as a dead body, judging it by those parts\nhe had already converted into structures.”[80](part0015.html#ch2ft-80) He\ntries to imagine the base on the model of the superstructure. He is too aware\nof the rift between a sorrowful nature and the relentless optimism of the\nfive-year plan. They are not the same kind of organization.\n\nIn Prushevsky, “the passion of reason is the pull toward\ndeath.”[81](part0015.html#ch2ft-81) Prushevsky concerns himself only with dead\nmatter; Safronov consoles himself with the thought of the leap beyond it. Both\navoid the third layer, the problem of life, on which Voschev dwells, if not\nalways morosely: “Sadness is nothing … it means that our class senses the\nwhole world.”[82](part0015.html#ch2ft-82) Voschev’s wager is on the\ncomradeship of shared sadness. He extends Proletkult’s self-assumed task of\norganizing the whole world of production to production’s byproducts and\nexternalities, including its odd affects.\n\nAt night, the workers lie side by side, exhausted. At least their dreams\nremain their own: “Various dreams come to a laboring man at night—some express\na fulfilled hope, while others foresee a personal coffin in a clay grave—but\ndaytime is lived by everyone according to the same stooped method, through the\nendurance of a body digging the earth in order to plant into a fresh abyss an\neternal stone root of indestructible\narchitecture.”[83](part0015.html#ch2ft-83) Labor is the only really shared\npart of human experience in Platonov. Ideology is always, strangely,\nidiosyncratic. Everyone détourns universals in light of particular\nexperiences. In Platonov’s world, even Bogdanov’s _Red Star_ could not offer\nthe Sorelian myth of a universal horizon for everyone.\n\nIn an abandoned tile factory, a child cares for her dying mother, who was\nherself the daughter of the former owner. The child is not sure if her mother\nis dying from being bourgeois or from death. The workers from the pit find the\norphaned girl and bring her to their shelter to care for her. Some of them nod\napprovingly at this child who spouts aggressive slogans and seems to know more\nabout comrade Stalin than about her own mother. Safronov calls Nastya “the\nsubstance of creation and the aim and goal of every directive,” and, rather\nmore ambiguously, “our future object of joy.”[84](part0015.html#ch2ft-84)\n\nThe workers dig the pit ever deeper and wider. It is as if no base could ever\nsupport the extravagant superstructure promised as the substance of the plan.\nVoschev alone seems alert to the ontological crisis. Base, dead matter\nsupports the living, and life supports the soul, each a meager surplus of the\nlayer below. But if the soul can’t expand itself to the point of immersion in\nthe whole world, then the world cannot be organized. Its efforts remain\npartial and futile, and life slips back into the boring emptiness of dead\nmatter. Time not only has no end or goal but does not even permit the passing\non into the future of temporary reserves against entropy: “Endurance dragged\non wearily in the world, as if everything living found itself in the middle of\ntime and its own movement; its beginning had been forgotten by everyone, its\nend was unknown, and nothing remained but a direction to all\nsides.”[85](part0015.html#ch2ft-85) Another world is possible, and it is\nexactly the same as this one, just a variation among variations.\n\nThe failure of the plan, its alien quality over both the dead and the living,\nprompts only Voschev to attempt some other relation to being. Even Chicklin,\nthe pure proletarian digger, gets caught up in a peculiar ideological fervor.\nChicklin says to Voschev: “Who is it that exists in the world—the party or\nyou? Who is it that is?” Voschev is caught in the nightmare spectacle of a\nbeing he knows to be false, but whose existence cancels his own possibility of\nbeing as anything but refuse or worse—a “wrecker.” Voschev waits in vain for\nthe Celestial Party to advance on its own ontological rift. “When would a\nresolution be passed there to curtail the eternity of time and redeem the\nwearisomeness of life?”[86](part0015.html#ch2ft-86)\n\nHowever, the dominant reaction is Safronov’s, which is to double down on the\nleap: “We no longer feel the heat from the bonfire of the class struggle.” The\nexhaustion of the working class and its old revolutionary vanguard has come to\npass. Safronov says in despair: “Ay, you masses! It’s difficult to organize\nyou all into the gruel of communism. What do you bastards want? You’ve worn\nout the entire vanguard, you vermin!”[87](part0015.html#ch2ft-87) Even\nBogdanov’s transfusions could not keep this vanguard going.\n\nSafronov volunteers to assist with the forced collectivization of a nearby\nvillage into the General Line Collective Farm, and he and another are killed\nfor their troubles.[88](part0015.html#ch2ft-88) The civil war between town and\ncountry is being fought to its bitter conclusion. Chicklin assumes within his\nbody all the undone tasks of his dead comrades. If Voschev keeps an archive of\nthe forgotten thing, Chicklin tries to preserve at least a fragment of lost\nhuman labor, but in both cases it is in vain. The living and the dead have\ntheir own organization and it isn’t the plan.\n\nPresiding over the collectivization is a character known only as “the\nactivist,” who for all of his outward personality seems to have evaporated\ninto the letter of the plan. The activist imagines he is the “most ideological\nworker in the district superstructure.” Yet he is troubled from time to time\nby the anguish of life, even as he gets the benefits of future time on credit\nby being in the vanguard. “Is truth the due of the proletariat?” asks\nVoschev.[89](part0015.html#ch2ft-89) The activist offers what’s left of the\nproletariat agitation without truth, a perpetual and futile motion which\nproduces its own apparent truth out of itself but is void of any basis in the\ntektological forming and deforming of life out of matter. The activist even\nthinks the wind is out to sabotage the plan. And of course, in Platonov’s\nsense—wind as eroding time—it is.\n\nThe peasants are mostly nameless and faceless in _Foundation Pit_ , as they\nwere to the Stalinists, but they are not voiceless. As one peasant describes\nthe situation: “There’s no jam in the middle. It’s total collectivization—no\njoy for us!”[90](part0015.html#ch2ft-90) Another mourns for the trees, which\nhe feels are his own flesh, and which will no longer be part of his being once\nthey are collectivized. Another correctly predicts that some form of the old\nproperty relations will be the only result of forced collectivization. It\nisn’t the people who will own the land, but Stalin and his\nfactotums.[91](part0015.html#ch2ft-91)\n\nAnd yet the peasants slaughter their own livestock rather than lose it. “Cows\nand horses were lying in these yards, their carcasses gaping and rotting—and\nthe heat of life accumulated through long years beneath the sun was still\nseeping out from them into the air, into the shared wintry\nspace.”[92](part0015.html#ch2ft-92) Platonov conjures the eerie sight of an\nuntimely plague of flies, a swarm of black dots on the white snow, the seasons\nout of joint.\n\nA strange fur grows on proletarian bodies. Perhaps it is related to the “last\nunknown proletarian,” a bear who works at the smithy. The bear, or the\nhammerer as he is also called, is taken around the peasant huts to sniff out\nkulaks.[93](part0015.html#ch2ft-93) He denounces peasants who really did\nexploit him. It is time, as Nastya says, to “liquidate the kulaks as a class.”\nNot: liquidate the kulaks, as a _class_. That is, abolish class distinctions\nbetween rich and poor peasants. Rather: liquidate the _kulaks_ as a class.\nMeaning, liquidate them all physically. The activist has a raft made so they\ncan be “liquidated” by floating them off, down the river, “organized for\neternity.”[94](part0015.html#ch2ft-94)\n\nNastya the innocent ideologue asks: “Have you made a collective farm here for\nStalin?” In a notorious article called “Dizzy With Success,” Stalin put the\nblame for the mass murder of kulaks, the destruction of livestock, and the\ninevitable famine on his underlings. In _Foundation Pit_ , the decision is\nsheeted home where it belongs. The activist will be denounced as a wrecker.\nThe bear pounds the iron in the smithy into ruins. The poor peasants dance\nmadly after the kulaks leave. They have been rendered numb by events. “We\nsense everything, only not ourselves,” the assembled collective says to\nChicklin.[95](part0015.html#ch2ft-95)\n\nThe activist draws up his accounts of the collective farm. He measures inputs\nand outputs. He decides who has worked how much and who receives which wages.\nBut Voschev has his own information. He collects objects which are the worn\ntraces of human life and labor. They might be the tokens of another tektology,\nof an impossible organization, by which “soul” might stand for that which\norganizes living labor in and against dead matter for shared life. In the\nabsence of which they are rather tokens now only of “vengeance through the\norganization of eternal human meaning—on behalf of those who are now lying\nquietly in the earth.”[96](part0015.html#ch2ft-96) Both the activist and\nVoschev make their reckoning gifts to Nastya. Voschev’s is a sack of “rare\ntoys, not for sale anywhere”—those worthless fragments of lost lives that\ncannot be commodified even in the topsy-turvy concentrated spectacle of the\nStalin era.[97](part0015.html#ch2ft-97)\n\nFor Voschev the futile, destructive laboring of the bear is a witness to the\nabsence of truth. Truth cannot call itself into existence by tugging on its\nown bootstraps. The result is just a fake ontology, an unsupportable being\nthat destroys the clay on which it stands. And yet there’s nobody left to\nmourn the passing of truth from this world, its becoming unreal and spectral.\nAs Voschev says over the dead activist: “So that’s why I never knew meaning!\nIt wasn’t just me you sucked dry, you arid soul, it was the whole of our\nclass! And we were left to ferment like quiet dregs, and to know\nnothing!”[98](part0015.html#ch2ft-98)\n\nNastya’s heart grows tired and she dies, and Chicklin buries her in the depths\nof the foundation pit. In a weird way Platonov’s own faith that some sort of\ncommunism might not be impossible is buried in the depths of _Foundation Pit_.\nHis act of witness is not just a moral one. The future House of the\nProletariat really is sheltered in here, but in its depths, and in death.\nWhile this is in many ways his bleakest text, certain things remain. Voschev\nstill feels the absence of truth in both soul and body. He still has the\nfallen leaf to remind him.\n\n[_HAPPY MOSCOW:_ SUPERSTRUCTURAL PEOPLE](part0005.html#sec-14)\n\nIf _Foundation Pit_ is about the endless labor to produce an infrastructure,\nthen _Happy Moscow_ is about mostly “superstructural” people, living high up\nin city apartments.[99](part0015.html#ch2ft-99) It is a portrait of the cream\nof the first Soviet generation, with no memories of capitalism or the Tsar,\nwhose lives are insulated from much of Stalinist reality. Most of the\ncharacters are technical intellectuals, the proto-hacker class, Bogdanov’s\npeople, successful and renowned.[100](part0015.html#ch2ft-100) This is the era\nof Stalin’s second five-year plan. If the first was all about basic industry,\nthe second pays at least some attention to leisure and consumer goods,\nproduced in quantities sufficient at least to reward those faithful to the\nregime.\n\nLife has become happier, Stalin has declared, but not for Platonov. Among\nother things, _Happy Moscow_ is—astonishingly—a critique of commodity\nfetishism written right from the heart of the socialist second world. The\nrevolution has become a manic repetition of production and consumption, where\nthe common project of labor yields only solitary consumer satisfactions. “The\nspherical hall of the restaurant, deafened by the music and the howls of the\npeople, and filled by the tormenting smoke of cigarettes and the gas of\nsqueezed passions, seemed to revolve, every voice in it sounded twice, and\nsuffering kept on being repeated.”[101](part0015.html#ch2ft-101) Can there\nreally be even the beginnings of a socialist base if the symptoms of\ncapitalism are appearing in the superstructures? Stalin has to deliver rising\nliving standards, for he has taken away everything else.\n\nPlatonov gathers most of his characters for an event at the Young Communist\nLeague. Many famous engineers gather, as well as artists, understood at the\ntime as “engineers of the soul.” Who will sit next to whom at the communal\ntable? “What they really wanted was to sit next to everyone at once.” Platonov\ndoes not doubt the intentions of his art and tech hackers, only the efficacy\nof their methods. They want the shared life, but they cannot find it. “They\nall knew, or guessed at, the sullen dimensions of nature, the extensiveness of\nhistory, the length of future time and the true scale of their powers; they\nwere rational and practical people, not to be seduced by empty\ndelusion.”[102](part0015.html#ch2ft-102)\n\nLike Dvanov, they live at best on secondary ideas, at worst, stuck where they\nare by what Lauren Berlant calls a _cruel optimism_ , their own private\ndesires impeding them. Certain music, particularly Beethoven, calls the\ncharacters to the great project of finding and building the common life. It is\nthe “last dream of a heroic world.”[103](part0015.html#ch2ft-103) The music\nexcites the common space of the air, but is heard in individual and\nfragmentary ways.\n\nLike so many Platonov characters, Moscow Chestnova is an orphan. She was\nraised by the state and trained as a parachutist, because she likes wind and\nsun. She is a bit like Dvanov, a pure revolutionary spirit caught up in\nevents. She wants to stand by the accelerator of the locomotive, not\nexperiencing life but making it. She embodies the labor point of view. “Her\nheart could have regulated the course of events,” but it\ndoesn’t.[104](part0015.html#ch2ft-104) She is more object than subject of\nhistory.\n\nThere is an ascetic side to Platonov, much more characteristic of a certain\nstrain of Russian intellectual of his time than of our own. There is a\ndistaste for sexual love in particular, and hence a queasiness about women,\nwhom he takes as tokens of it. But in _Happy Moscow_ he is onto something that\nstill speaks to our time: that the obsession with the couple, and the sexual\nlove mixed with romance that legitimates it, are at best stand-ins and at\nworst obstacles for shared life. Moscow’s dérives, wandering the city, and her\nserial trysts, are attempts to find both the uses and the limits of love.\nMarriage is not the answer. She “began to love just one sly man who kept a\ntight hold on her, as if she were some inalienable\nasset.”[105](part0015.html#ch2ft-105)\n\nAs in _Foundation Pit_ , Platonov takes literally Marx’s notion of an economic\ninfrastructure below and a cultural superstructure up above. Only here the\nstory is not about the endless task of building a base, but about the other\nStalinist desire: to occupy the heights above such a base immediately. This is\nwhy Moscow is training to be a paratrooper, going higher even than the newly\nsprouting towers of her city. The aircraft, rather than the locomotive, is the\ngleaming new technological image of historical momentum.\n\nOne of Platonov’s most striking images is of Moscow lighting a cigarette while\ntesting a new parachute technology. Descending from an aeronautical\nsuperstructure toward the earth, a solipsistic pleasure distracts her. The\nwebbing catches alight and she has to pull the reserve ‘chute to make it. “So\nworld, this is what you are really like! … You are only soft so long as we\ndon’t touch you!”[106](part0015.html#ch2ft-106) She glides past the boundary\nseparating technology and catastrophe. She gets fired from the Air Corps upon\nlanding for having an attitude of luxury rather than modesty toward nature.\nThere lies Platonov’s whole critique of the Stalinist twist upon Bolshevik\nvolunteerism, of Stalin’s attack on the earth from above. The leap has its own\nvanity.\n\nMoscow tries not to repeat that selfish turn in her wanderings on the surface,\nlooking for a way to share life that is neither too airy nor too earthy, too\nmerry nor too sad. She is the spirit of the commons, “she belonged to nobody,”\nshe is a “living truth.”[107](part0015.html#ch2ft-107) But perhaps her\nsolution to the riddle of the shared life is just to keep trying to live it:\n“She wanted to take part in everything and she was filled by that\nindeterminacy of life which is just as happy as its definitive\nresolution.”[108](part0015.html#ch2ft-108)\n\nThe conceptual personae that Moscow encounters on her wanderings play out\nvariations on the struggle for the shared life. Bozhko is a dedicated shock-\nworker by day. By night he writes letters to proletarians all over the\nworld—in Esperanto. He sits at his desk under portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and\nthe inventor of that artificial common language. But he also puts up smaller\npictures of nameless people from all over the world.\n\nBozhko works in the Weights and Measures Office, as did Platonov for a time\nwhen he could not publish. He wants the people to have accurate measures of\ntheir labor so there will be no more riots on the collective farms, as if it\nwere just a problem of measure for measure. He picks up every crumb so the\ncountry can thrive in its entirety. He generously pays for Moscow’s tuition at\nflying school, and is very proper with her, but after her visits, “Bozhko\nusually lay face down on the bed and yearned from sorrow, even though his only\nreason for living was universal joy.”[109](part0015.html#ch2ft-109)\n\nSambikin is a surgeon obsessed with longevity. He would not be out of place\namong Bogdanov’s blood transfusion enthusiasts. Dissecting the baser strata,\nhis concern is with a more physiological layer of being than the social being\nof Bozhko. “His mind lived in a terror of responsibility for the entire\nsenseless fate of physical substance.”[110](part0015.html#ch2ft-110) In a\ntroubling scene, he operates on the brain of a sick child, but leaves a little\nof the infection in him, as removing it would require paring his little body\ndown even to its toenails. It is the molecular that irks him.\n\nLike many of Platonov’s more conscious comrades, he can see around the corners\nof the dream that protects us from material life, and adopts an experimental\nattitude to it. “Sambikin began to ponder the life of matter—the life of his\nown self; it was as if he were a laboratory animal, the part of the world he\nhad been allocated so that he could investigate the entirety of everything, in\nall its obscurity.”[111](part0015.html#ch2ft-111) But where Bozhko lights upon\nthe totality and not the particular; Sambikin loses himself in the molecular.\n\nSambikin extends true but partial metaphors out of his labors. This is how one\ncan read his “dialectical psychology,” which holds that what is distinctive\nabout our species-being is that we obsess about the gap between two kinds of\nthought isolated from the world, which for animals are separate, yet\nintimately related to their world. He locates them in the brain and the spinal\ncord; cognition and sensation; reflection and labor; molar and molecular—as if\ndualism were an evolutionary error.\n\nUnhappiness is a body where cognition and sensation are out of joint. “But\nthen our two consciousnesses couple together again, we once again become human\nbeings in the embrace of our ‘two-edged’ thought, and nature, organized\naccording to the principle of an impoverished singleness, grits her teeth and\ncurls herself up to escape from the activity of these terrible dual structures\nwhich she never engendered …”[112](part0015.html#ch2ft-112) Sambikin is\nterrified of his “two passions eternally copulating.” Unlike Bogdanov,\nPlatonov is pessimistic about the feedback loop from cognition to sensation.\nThe rift, he senses, may be inevitable. Both cognition and sensation are\nphysiological, but that does not guarantee a smoothly functioning monism.\n\nA possible name for one of those passions is _soul_. Sambikin the\nphysiological materialist thinks he has located the soul in the intestine, in\nthe gap between that part of the intestine that is digesting food and that\npart that is accumulating waste for excretion. He cuts open a cadaver to show\nit to his friend Sartorius: “This emptiness in the intestines sucks all\nhumanity into itself and is the moving force of world history. This is the\nsoul—have a sniff!”[113](part0015.html#ch2ft-113)\n\nSartorius later decides, “If the passions of life were concentrated entirely\nin the darkness of the intestines, world history would not have been so long\nand fruitless.”[114](part0015.html#ch2ft-114) Life, at least the life of our\nspecies-being, is also something else, dependent on, but not reducible to,\nwant. Even Sambikin knows something of this. But to be human is to be limited,\nto not be up to the task of the shared life physiologically, at least not now.\nWe are only the embryo of something. But it is unhappiness which shows the way\nforward, not happiness. The happy know not their own disingressions.\n\nWhat Sambikin and Sartorius have in common is a “yearning for a definitive\nstructuring of the world.”[115](part0015.html#ch2ft-115) Sartorius is a famous\nengineer, and at first more immune to feelings for Moscow than Bozhko or\nSambikin. Better to love atoms and dust! He is a little further along the way\nto becoming part of a baser, more molecular world. But he falls for her too.\n“If Moscow had squatted to pee, Sartorius would have begun to\ncry.”[116](part0015.html#ch2ft-116) He sniffs her shoes. “He could have looked\nat the waste products of her body with the greatest of interest, since they\ntoo had not long ago formed part of a splendid\nperson.”[117](part0015.html#ch2ft-117) Sambikin’s obsession with the intestine\nand the interiority of the soul here becomes reversed into an obsession with\nthe body and the exteriority of life—and in Platonov the waste products of\nboth body and soul can be sniffed!\n\nSartorius wants to marry Moscow but she is always exceeding what can be an\n“inalienable asset,” and in any case Moscow refuses him, as she alone knows\nthat the couple could be just a barrier to shared life rather than a step\ntoward it. When they fuck it only gets worse. It does not dissipate his\npossessive desire. As Moscow insists, “it is impossible to unite through love”\nand “love cannot be communism.”[118](part0015.html#ch2ft-118) It’s an\nappetite, a _want_. It’s like eating food, a necessity, but nothing sacred.\nHere Platonov pursues the death of God into what is still its last hold-out:\nromantic-cum-sexual desire.\n\nSartorius abandons the “high road of\ntechnology.”[119](part0015.html#ch2ft-119) But he remains in a sense an\nexperimental engineer, a human soul engineer, but in the reverse sense to that\nmeant by Stalinist doctrine. “Sartorius could see that the world consisted\nprimarily of destitute matter, which it was almost impossible to love but\nessential to understand.”[120](part0015.html#ch2ft-120) The soul is that part\nof human matter that cannot be instrumentalized, which has to be treated as\nthe temperamental organ of an everyday practice. “Sartorius realized that love\ncame into being as a result of the poverty of society, a universal poverty\nthat had still not been eliminated and which meant people were unable to find\nany better, higher destiny and didn’t know what to do with\nthemselves.”[121](part0015.html#ch2ft-121) Love is a falling short of\norganization, or a compensation for its falling: the heart of a heartless, and\nGodless, world.\n\nSartorius buys a black-market passport and begins another life as someone\nelse, and starts to forget being Sartorius.[122](part0015.html#ch2ft-122) This\nthrows into shocking relief a moment when hearing Beethoven almost makes\nSambikin recall some former life. What if everyone passed into someone else\nand forgot their former self? Sartorius goes out into the world to “research\nthe entire extent of current life by transforming himself into other\npeople.”[123](part0015.html#ch2ft-123) And this might be Platonov’s account of\nhis own method, of locating fragments of lost labor, which in their sadder\nmoments reveal the ungainly and partial synthesis so far achieved by our\nspecies-being, our fallings-short of dynamic equilibrium.\n\nSartorius at least gets as far as debunking the extorted reconciliation of\ncontraries in a false totality supposedly ruled by communist will:\n\n> Sartorius made a movement of his hand—thus, according to the universal\n> theory of the world instigating an electro-magnetic oscillation which must\n> disturb even the most distant star. He smiled at such a pathetic and\n> impoverished conception of the great world. No, the world was better and\n> more mysterious than that: neither a movement of the hand nor the work of\n> the human heart would disturb the stars—otherwise everything would have been\n> shaken to pieces long ago by all this trembling\n> piffle.[124](part0015.html#ch2ft-124)\n\nSartorius, become the worker Grunyakhin, can still say: “I’m an engineer, I\ncan tell you: nature’s something altogether more serious. You can’t play games\nwith nature.” Even as nature toys with us.\n\nAll of Moscow’s lovers and admirers are superstructural people, whose\nspecialized intellectual labors grasp the world only partially. When Moscow\nherself commits her body to hard work it is below the surface, at the base of\nthe base, as it were, working on the Moscow city subway. Her second\n“industrial accident,” below rather than above the superstructure, is not\nself-inflicted, but inflicted by her selflessness. She hobbles toward the end\nof the book, worn and thin and on a wooden leg. Real labor is more mutilating\nthan a technical or intellectual hack. The problem remains the separation of\nthe two aspects of the labor point of view.\n\nThe last of Moscow’s lovers and admirers is not one of the superstructural\npeople but Komyagin, an ailing would-be artist eking out a marginal existence.\nHis former wife still visits him. Moscow listens through the sewer pipe in the\nwall as they fuck. “Our love has grown into something better—into shared\npoverty …”[125](part0015.html#ch2ft-125) Komyagin, who reserves himself from\nthe Soviet state and its great projects, is in some ways the character closest\nto communism with his “worn out love.”\n\nBut there is something too enervated about Komyagin. Moscow rejects him too.\n“No, this was not the high road that led into the distance; the road of life\ndid not pass through the poverty of love, or through the intestines, or\nthrough the zealous attempts of a Sartorius to comprehend precise\ntrifles.”[126](part0015.html#ch2ft-126) Moscow is not on a journey with a\ndestination. There is no Hegelian overcoming and uplifting. There is no land\nor sky, or even horizon. As Bozhko, of all characters, realizes: “Mother\nhistory’s made monsters of the lot of us!”[127](part0015.html#ch2ft-127)\n\nMoscow’s line is more a drift, a dérive, outside of the division of labor and\nits partial results, but one which touches on the fragments of what might have\nto be brought together in a shared life, a comradely life, the only life\noutside of death.[128](part0015.html#ch2ft-128) Bozhko’s selfless\ncommunication, Sambikin’s clinical regard of the material body, Sartorius’\nmolecular precision, Komyagin’s love shorn of self-involved desire—these are\nthe traces Moscow finds in the city, after wandering high and low, and far and\nwide, within the city’s perimeter, the stray leaves of the labor point of\nview. Where Voschev collects fragmentary objects, Moscow collects bits of\nsubjectivity.\n\nAs Fredric Jameson has noted of Platonov, the molar and the molecular don’t\nadd up.[129](part0015.html#ch2ft-129) Something keeps falling out of the\nstory, even at the scale of characters. Even big-hearted Moscow vents a\nStalinist urge to have useless Komyagin erased from life. But in the end she\nknows that’s no solution. The leap of faith comes down to earth, and in its\nself-regard, it burns itself up on its descent.\n\n[THE SOUL OF MAN UNDER COMMUNISM](part0005.html#sec-15)\n\nAt a time when Stalin declared the final victory of the socialist economy in\nindustry and agriculture, Platonov managed at least a temporary escape to the\nSoviet far east. There the women still ground corn by hand, and Soviet power\nwas still somewhat notional.[130](part0015.html#ch2ft-130) Unable to publish,\nGorky got him attached to a writer’s brigade expedition to Turkmenia in 1934,\nto which he was able to return for a few months the following year.\n\n_Soul_ , also known as _Dzhan_ , is the novella that resulted. It is a\ndétournement of “high Stalinist” adventure\nwriting.[131](part0015.html#ch2ft-131) It is not about the mythic proletarian\nof the old Bolshevik imagination, but rather the cult of the Stalinist leader.\nIt follows Chagataev from Moscow to the East, where he was born, and back\nagain. He is of course an orphan, who found a father in Stalin, and whose\nreturn journey is to the country of his mother. _Soul_ is, most astonishingly,\nan imagining of a kind of non-Stalin. It is also a restaging of the scenario\nof _Chevengur_ , but with a surprising outcome.\n\nChagataev is from a homeless, wandering people called the Dzhan, made up of\nexiles and deserters of all nations. Their name means soul, their only\npossession, for they have less even than proletarians. And yet they outlive\nempires. “The beys thought that the soul meant only despair; but in the end it\nwas their dzhan that was the death of them; they had too little dzhan of their\nown, too little capacity to feel, suffer, think and struggle. They had too\nlittle of the wealth of the poor”—rather like all ruling\nclasses.[132](part0015.html#ch2ft-132)\n\nThe Dzhan play out a series of tactics. Cruelly oppressed by the Khan of\nKhiva, who tortures his subjects to make them fear him, the Dzhan walk right\ninto his city and demand to be killed all at once. The Khan only manages to\nkill those Dzhan who feared death. The others walk about the bazaar unscathed,\nnonchalantly picking fruit from the stalls and eating freely without payment,\nbefore returning to the desert. It is not unlike Platonov’s own strategy for\nenduring Stalinism.\n\nAs the child Chagataev says to his mother of living in the desert: “We can\nlive without thinking anything and pretend we’re not\nus.”[133](part0015.html#ch2ft-133) But the desert is hard and poor, and the\nDzhan exhaust themselves in it. The desert is an extreme version of\nBartleby’s, “I would prefer not to,” a refusal of any and all engagement, but\nit comes at the price of extinguishing not only life and selfhood but also the\nsoul, which requires a surplus of life for it to exist.\n\nThe Dzhan are the defeated in a spiritual class struggle. “The class struggle\nbegins with the victory of the oppressors over the ‘holy spirit’ confined\nwithin the slave: blasphemy against the master’s beliefs—against the master’s\nsoul, the master’s god—goes unpardoned, while the slave’s own soul is ground\ndown in … destructive labor.” And so the Dzhan nation chose to forget it had a\nsoul. It was not tempted by anything and could live on next to nothing. “It\npretends to be dead—otherwise those who are happy and strong will come and\ntorment it again.”[134](part0015.html#ch2ft-134)\n\nLittle Chagataev is sent off with the last of the food and with only a walking\nstick for company to find a new father for himself. The one he finds is Soviet\npower. He studies economics in Moscow, where he meets Vera, with whom he forms\na relationship, but without “furious pleasure.” Vera already has a\nchild—Ksenya—and is pregnant again when she and Chagataev meet. Platonovian\ndissatisfactions trouble him: “Chagataev could not endure the strength of his\nown life,” and “he could not understand why happiness seemed so improbable to\neveryone.”[135](part0015.html#ch2ft-135)\n\nFortunately a mission intervenes: Soviet power sends him to find his lost\nnation. As the train heads east, he notices that the portraits of Stalin look\nless and less like the man they are supposed to represent. “The artist tried\nto make Stalin’s face resemble his own.”[136](part0015.html#ch2ft-136) As\nperhaps does Platonov, who in _Soul_ imagines a non-Stalin in his own image.\n\nLike Dvanov, Chagataev abandons the train and heads out on foot, beyond the\nreach of the locomotive of history, and even of the history of locomotives.\nBeyond the rails is a harsh landscape. The desert is not grand; nature isn’t\nprovidence. It was not made for the human and is indifferent to us: “It was as\nif the world had been created for some brief, mocking game. But this game of\nmake-believe had dragged on for a long time, for eternity, and nobody felt\nlike laughing any more.” And yet Chagataev sides, in this landscape, with the\npowers of life. He cares for “an entire, difficult\nworld.”[137](part0015.html#ch2ft-137)\n\nHe wanders the land of his childhood in search of his people. Most have gone\ntheir separate ways. Some are off working on irrigation projects around the\nAmu Darya River. Some still live in families, and have love for one another,\nbut have neither hope nor food nor happiness. Chagataev finds his mother, and\nnow “everything was here—mother and homeland, childhood and\nfuture.”[138](part0015.html#ch2ft-138) But his mother moves about as if in a\ndream, and it is as if he wakes into this dream. His mother still believes in\nproperty, but hasn’ t the strength even for greed. The Dzhan are beyond\nthought and language.\n\nChagataev is not the first agent the state has sent out into this wilderness.\nHe finds the skeleton of a Red Army soldier and adopts his helmet. He meets\nhis immediate predecessor, Nur Mohammad, who gave up trying to bring the Dzhan\nto communism. “I can’t resurrect the dead,” he\nsays.[139](part0015.html#ch2ft-139) Nur’s policy is to keep burying the Dzhan\nuntil they’re all gone, then return to the state and report “mission\naccomplished.” Or so he says. Nur has something of the same cruelty as the\nKhan of Khiva: “If you torture people too long, they die. You should torture\nthem a little, then let them play, then torture them\nagain.”[140](part0015.html#ch2ft-140) Plato has it in _The Laws_ that we are\nall the playthings of the Gods.[141](part0015.html#ch2ft-141) Nur would have\nearthly power aspire to that Godly power, rather than to that of the things\nwith which it plays.\n\nThe Dzhan lose a three-year-old child in the desert and barely notice. Here it\nis not communism but its absence that is responsible for the lost generation.\nOne of the last born of the Dzhan is Aidym. Nur had intended to lead all the\nDzhan into Afghanistan and sell them for slaves, but only Aidym is of any\nvalue now. Nur rapes her, but in this version of the story the children born\nof communism suffer yet don’t die.\n\nChagataev, the good agent, the non-Stalin, bearer of the memory of the\nrevolution, has to fight the bad agent, its betrayer. Chagataev is resolved\nthat his nation, “more than anything, needed a different life, a life that\ndidn’t exist yet and which they could live without it being the death of\nthem.”[142](part0015.html#ch2ft-142) When he learns by telegram that his Vera,\nback in Moscow, has died in childbirth, he knows that the faith that was once\nan objective worldview has passed from this world, and there is nothing for it\nbut to press on, if only to another iteration of this world.\n\nAlone in the desert, Chagataev starts to tune in to the ambient chorus of the\nnatural world, barely audible and indifferent to him: “All through the night\nhe heard round him a vague humming, a diverse agitation, the troubled movement\nof a natural world that had faith in what it was doing and where it was\ngoing.” But it offers nothing for the Dzhan. Their souls scatter and expire.\nChagataev too succumbs. “He began to mutter words to himself, living his life\nas if it were superfluous to him.”[143](part0015.html#ch2ft-143)\n\nThe Dzhan find sheep in the desert, but without a shepherd. The sheep watch\nimpassively as one of their number is slaughtered, as if it were no concern of\ntheirs. The Dzhan follow the sheep, while wild beasts follow the Dzhan in an\nendless routine of subsistence without direction or end. Life goes on by\nhabit, inertia, while the sand grinds, grain against grain, in the wind.\nSometimes the sheep stray, and like the tumbleweeds are blown off course, “and\nso the universal guiding force, of everything from plants to humans, is really\nthe wind.”[144](part0015.html#ch2ft-144) This is bare uneventful time, without\naccumulation or memory, genesis or goal:\n\n> But what was the dream that nourished the consciousness of the nation, if\n> the whole of this wandering nation was able to go on bearing its fate? The\n> nation couldn’t be living off truth; had it known the truth about itself, it\n> would have died at once from sorrow. But people live because they have been\n> born, not because of mind or truth, and, while the heart goes on beating, it\n> breaks up and grinds away their despair, losing its own substance as it\n> destroys itself through work and endurance.[145](part0015.html#ch2ft-145)\n\nIn this closed loop of everyday, unexaminable life, the Dzhan forget\nthemselves, but endure.\n\nAll except Chagataev, who is tormented by memories. “Stalin was alive and\nwould bring about the universal happiness of the unhappy anyway, but it was a\nshame that the Dzhan nation, who had a greater need for life and happiness\nthan any other nation of the Soviet Union, would by then be\ndead.”[146](part0015.html#ch2ft-146) Or perhaps Chagataev, their non-Stalin,\nmight have another idea, not one which introduces the surplus death of the\nuniversal into life, but rather one which both produces a surplus out of dead\nmatter beyond subsistence, and which in turn introduces life into thought. The\nutopia of Chevengur starts with the universal of equality by which any\nviolence can be justified, and which cannot support life. The Dzhan start with\nlife, to which surplus is added, and out of which a comradeship might form,\nthe only viable tektological formula.\n\nChagataev has to find a different way to lead, after the disenchantment with\ngreat men and their fatal plans, tempting though they are. He learns to lead\n_from_ a situation rather than _to_ a horizon. “It seemed to Chagataev that\nthe whole of humanity, were it here before him, would be looking at him with\nthis same expectancy, ready to delude itself with hopes, endure disillusion,\nand busy itself once again with diverse, inescapable\nlife.”[147](part0015.html#ch2ft-147) Having endured disillusion with the\nuniversal, there’s nothing for it but designs for life, low theories, and\neveryday praxis from the labor point of view.\n\nChagataev is the expendable, rather than conquering, vanguard. He is not\nStalin, to whom a people belong like slaves. “He felt as if he belonged to\nothers, as if he were the last possession of those who have no possessions,\nabout to be squandered to no purpose, and he was seized by the greatest, most\nvital fury of his life.”[148](part0015.html#ch2ft-148) The last possession of\nbare life lies in someone else’s memory of it. Chagataev both remembers the\nDzhan as they are and loves them as they might be, in advance and forever.\n\nChagataev designs a viable life with his people. Aidym becomes the president\nof their soviet. They no longer have to strain their memories to remember\nthemselves. It is hardly utopia. The Dzhan still prefer oblivion to communism.\nThey have forgotten the aim of life, like zombie-Bartlebys. They forgot their\nown wants, since nothing had ever come of them. They live only through\ninertia. They may have no soul left to lose. “Had everything there been so\nworn away by suffering that even imagination, the intelligence of the poor,\nhad entirely died?”[149](part0015.html#ch2ft-149)\n\nPraxis starts and ends with the struggle for life; everything else is just\nuseless duplicity or dangerous theology. Chagataev helps them find food. “He\nknew that this was very important, since only a minority of people living on\nthe earth dine every day and the majority do not.” The nation are still not\nconvinced life is an advantage, but they now grasp that life at base upon\nwhich soul depends, and without the fetishism which makes soul appear as\nautonomous or even causative. They know that the soul, like the body, has to\neat. “They ate without greed, taking care of the food in their mouths, with a\nconsciousness of the food’s necessity and meek thoughtfulness, as if seeing in\ntheir imagination the faces and souls of all those who had labored hard to\nprocure the food and give it to them.”[150](part0015.html#ch2ft-150)\n\nHis mother dies, leaving Chagataev orphaned now from both the state and his\nown family. In _Soul_ it is the past that falls away, as it should, not the\nfuture. But the Dzhan go their separate ways. Dreams separate us, _even when\nthey are dreams of communism_. Or rather: communisms, since in Platonov,\nactual communisms are never a stage in a molar narrative, but are at best\nproliferating situations in which comradely love prevails, if just for a time.\nLike all people, the Dzhan can find how best to live for themselves. Chagataev\nis surprised not to be of any use to his nation any more. As Aidym says, “We\nwant something different now, a different kind of grief, a more interesting\ngrief.”[151](part0015.html#ch2ft-151) The Dzhan want a grief adequate to the\ntragedy of the totality.\n\nThe role of Chagataev as non-Stalin can only be negative, a vanguard that\ndissolves itself in acts. Yet Chagataev wants to gather the nation back, and\ngoes in search of them. In a market town he meets Khanom and experiences\nlove—one of the few such instances in Platonov. “And then Chagataev put both\nhis arms around Khanom, as if he had seen in her an image of what had never\nbeen realized in him and never would be realized in him but would remain alive\nafter him—in the form of a different, higher human being, on an earth grown\nkinder than it had been for Chagataev.”[152](part0015.html#ch2ft-152) Sexual\nlove can now generate an image of a future evolution. Perhaps the memory of\nthe future can be kept there, rather than buried deep in some base crypt.\n\nChagataev writes a report to the capital, which is perhaps like the one\nSerbinov writes from Chevengur, except that this one is about the happiness of\nthe shared life of the Dzhan, and also their still-pressing material need. In\n_Chevengur_ , the documenting of one or several communisms is the end of them.\nThe troops arrive on horseback in answer to Serbinov’s report. In response to\nthe report of _Soul_ , trucks arrive not with guns but with provisions, a\ngreat gift from elsewhere.[153](part0015.html#ch2ft-153) Comradely love and\nthe production of a material surplus, like clay and top soil, rest on one\nanother but are separate achievements. Chagataev takes Aidym to Moscow, and\nthe Dzhan elect Khanom president of the soviet. Chagataev reunites with\nKsenya. The text ends with them holding hands.\n\n[SOCIALIST TRAGEDY](part0005.html#sec-16)\n\nNone of Platonov’s great series of (anti)novellas were published in his\nlifetime, although some of his very fine stories were. Somehow he survived the\n1930s. He became a war correspondent, and after the war published versions of\ntraditional folk tales. His last story appeared in a children’s magazine, and\nrecounts the fortunes of a speck of grain and a speck of gunpowder. Even this\nmolecular fable attracted censure.[154](part0015.html#ch2ft-154)\n\nWhile without doubt one of the great writers of the Soviet experience, he can\nbe read also in other registers. The critical misalignment of the non-living,\nthe living, and the organizational diagram is no less a problem of our own\ntime. One can’t help suspecting that the Carbon Liberation Front would have\ncome as no surprise to him. He was already thinking about the problem of labor\nand nature as a problem calling for new kinds of writing outside of socialist\nrealism. The challenge of writing in and against capitalist realism calls for\nanother Platonov, or perhaps rather for a new kind of proletkult.\n\nI want to conclude these meditations on Platonov with two of his (non)essays,\nfragments that point toward a Platonovian practice for our time. One is on\n“Socialist Tragedy” (1934), and the other is on “The Factory of Literature”\n(1926). The former defines the problem, and the latter the method, for\nPlatonov’s heretical Marxist practice.\n\nPlatonov’s Marxism is an ascetic one, based on the experience of sub-\nproletarian everyday life. Nature is not abundant—and just as well. If nature\nwas abundant then it would have been plundered and squandered by history\nalready. Or perhaps nature would have destroyed itself by now, even without\nhuman agency. “The dialectic is probably an expression of miserliness, of the\ndaunting harshness of nature’s construction, and it is only thanks to this\nthat the historical development of humankind became possible.” Otherwise it\nwould all be over, “as when a child plays with sweets that have melted in his\nhand before he has even time to eat them.”[155](part0015.html#ch2ft-155)\n\nTechnology plays a decisive role in the struggle within and against nature.\nTechnology for Platonov is not just machines and such, but, as in Bogdanov, a\nmethod, or even a design, of organization. Included in a technology is its\ntechnicians, and even their ideology. This ideology is not superstructural. It\nis internal to technology’s organization, one of its elements. The technology,\ntechnician, and ideology assemblage, or apparatus, organizes itself and its\nobjects in particular ways, and is prone to breakage, decay, and misdirection.\nPlatonov pays particular attention to the technician’s part within this as a\nkind of love for the machine.\n\n“The situation between technology and nature is a tragic one.” Technology\noffers leverage on the world, but always from a particular vantage point.\nNature can always surround or surmount it. The “dialectic” of nature always\neludes the apparatus of labor and technology. Nature is the enemy of our\nspecies-being.[156](part0015.html#ch2ft-156) Technology can only soften it.\nThere’s no end to the struggle in and against it. The unruliness of nature\nnever goes away, not least because it is part of the technical anyway, an\nunsleeping rust.\n\nIn both Bogdanov and Platonov, in complimentary but different ways, we find\nthe resources to think again about labor’s relation to nature as primary.\nCapitalism keeps capturing our attention. Communism fascinates some once\nagain, as an understandable but hardly helpful nostalgia. Meanwhile, the two\nmost useful categories to think with, and think of—labor and nature—receive\nhardly any love. This is where Bogdanov and Platonov come, like Dvanov and\nKopenkin, to the rescue.\n\nEvery increase in productive forces comes at some cost, somewhere. As Platonov\nsays in a prescient pair of lines: “The ancient life on the ‘surface’ of\nnature could still obtain what it needed from the waste and excretions of\nelemental forces and substances. But we are making our way inside the world,\nand in response it is pressing down upon us with equivalent force.” The mining\nof the earth for its properties undermines at the same time this very labor.\nIt is Bogdanov’s biregulator in a more pessimistic mode. There’s no enclosure\nthat can keep nature out. It is as true of Stalin’s grand projects as of our\ntime’s gated communities.\n\nLanguage is a thing, and like other things it can be appropriated and shared\nby labor. But while it belongs to the class of things, no thing has special\naccess to the objects beyond their ken. The world of things keeps coming to\nlight through a range of practices, and sometimes in difficult and intractable\nforms. Hence the vital significance of Platonov’s experience of electrical and\nhydrological engineering, through which the molecular thing enters his field\nof perception and also his writing. The intractability of things gives rise to\na special kind of tragedy.[157](part0015.html#ch2ft-157)\n\nSadness is the mood by which the divorce between the sensation of the world\nand the idea of it is felt and thought. This rift can be ignored, and thought\ncan go its own way, leaping fatally into the void. Or, grief can be shared.\nThe _comrades_ are the ones with which we share life’s task of shoring up its\nimpossible relation to a recalcitrant world. All we can share are the same\ntravails, and we are only comrades when we might all share all of them. An\ninjury to one is an injury to all.\n\nWe live on in spite of the impossibility of living, as if by habit. Everyday\nlife is a kind of inertia. Molecular matter yields a surplus on which life\nfuels; life in turn can yield another surplus, for that other life of the\nsoul. But there’s no transitive relation between these superstructures and\ntheir base, between topsoil and clay. It’s hard to actually know anything\nabout the infrastructure and nature from the experience of its surplus. We are\nnature’s orphans, or perhaps just its clones. We know it as cause but not so\nmuch what or how it causes, and even our own actions are included back in its\ncausative effect on us, unilaterally, without a two-way exchange or shadings\nof difference.[158](part0015.html#ch2ft-158)\n\nThat surplus that is soul can dream of a higher, universal idea, but those\nideas are always singular and inflected by private desires. They can’t be\ngeneralized. Only (non-intellectual) labor and (non-romantic) love are\nshared—Platonov adds love to Bogdanov’s labor—and in both cases not without\ntheir limitations. An idea is always a folly, but a necessary folly. The idea\nis a sort of impossible crystal, dead and inert, without which boredom and\ngrief weather us. But the idea on its own is only the concept of death, as if\nit could be outside of the entropy, inertia, and forgetfulness of life in\ntime. Ideas are there as material for experiment and substitution.\n\nBetter to live then on a _secondary idea_ , which mediates between the idea\nand labor, keeping the dead ideal from direct contact with life, where either\nthe idea of death will live and kill life, or life itself will kill the\ndeathly idea, but leave only boring emptiness. The secondary idea should be\npractical, attaching itself to the problem of life and inert matter, rather\nthan life and soul. The secondary idea is usually a design problem, and hence,\nin principle, soluble.\n\nThere is only one hope, and it is in eternal life, but this endless life has\nnothing to do with spirit or even the idea. It isn’t universal. It exists only\nin the sensation of shared existence. Living things are each other’s comrades,\neven in their struggles against each other. Our species-being is lost from\nshared life when we make a fetish of a particular idea, a particular love, or\na particular labor, as Bogdanov might say. Platonov shows the deadly\nconsequences of fetishes of this type.\n\nComradely life, devoted to its secondary ideas, is a homeless, rootless\nnation, in which each labors for another who labors for another. It is a life\ndone with the death-image of the absolute outside and beyond itself. Comrades\nare orphans by choice. It is not the parent who has abandoned them, it is they\nwho drift away from the spirit of the paternal idea, and who accept the poor\ntruth that nature is no mother but at best a “step-mother nature”—or even no\nkin at all. Let’s have done with these Oedipal substitutions.\n\nWhen drawn into the practice of everyday life, ideas dissolve into their\nconstituent parts, the bits of language, which are articulated in new and\nsurprising forms. This is détournement at work, the molecular labor of making\nand remaking sense in given situations. The people make meaning, but not with\nthe means of their own making. The proletariat might one day substitute for\nits various fetishisms an objective worldview, a tektology that might organize\nbase and superstructure. The “relative autonomy of the superstructures” is\nactually one of the fetishes to be overcome.[159](part0015.html#ch2ft-159)\n\n[THE FACTORY OF LITERATURE](part0005.html#sec-17)\n\nWhile it is of considerable antiquarian interest, Platonov’s “The Factory of\nLiterature” also lends itself to a reading as a method of constructing text\nthat anticipates not only détournement, but several critical forms of twenty-\nfirst-century cultural production that are usually seen as separate or even\nantithetical. Here is a bold precedent for the “uncreative” writing methods of\nKathy Acker, Vanessa Place, and Kenneth Goldsmith. It is also based in part in\na kind of “cultural analytics” of big data of the kind advocated by Lev\nManovich. And it touches on the kind of “networked book” advanced by Kathleen\nFitzpatrick and Bob Stein.[160](part0015.html#ch2ft-160) Even so, Platonov’s\nversion might have as yet unexplored affordances. Where socialist realism\nwould subordinate the labor of writing to the mythic templates of the party,\nPlatonov, as usual, reversed the procedure. He built a prose from the bottom\nup. It might yet work as a procedure in and against capitalist realism as\nwell.\n\nPlatonov describes a sort of fieldwork version of the “convolutes” Walter\nBenjamin constructed for his _Arcades Project_. Platonov:\n\n> I bought a leather notepad and divided it into seven sections with the\n> following headings: 1. Work, 2. Love, 3. Everyday Life, 4. Personality\n> traits, 5. Discussion with oneself, 6. Unexpected thoughts and findings and\n> 7. Miscellaneous and special … I include into this journal everything that I\n> find interesting and everything that can be a ready-made component for\n> literary work, including excerpts from newspapers, separate phrases from the\n> same source, pieces from different popular and not popular books, real\n> dialogues from different sources, and I write my own ideas, themes and\n> pieces. I am trying to live my life in a way that I notice everything that\n> is valuable for the notepad.[161](part0015.html#ch2ft-161)\n\nOne could see this as a sort of tagging exercise, sampling language and adding\n_metadata_ to it of seven kinds. But that’s just the start. Now comes the hard\npart: “I flip through the notepad in the evenings and I focus on one specific\nnote and I start working on that theme, also taking into account the next\nnotes and sketches. I focus on dialogues, description of streets and other\nmiracles that I slightly alter, depending on my goals and my capacity to\nconnect these pieces by personal cement.”\n\nAs with Platonov’s contemporary, the filmmaker Dziga Vertov, the emphasis\nmoves from making the elements of the work to the editing:\n\n> You end up with an essay where your contribution is only 5–10% but it’s all\n> about my edits and ambitions. Editing is what brings us closer to the author\n> since it is a very intimate spiritual individual corrector, that illustrates\n> the presence of a real and passionate hand and personal passion, as well as\n> the ambition and goal of a real person. Borrowed from people, I give it back\n> to them having thought it through … The result is, or is supposed to be,\n> truly fascinating because thousands of people worked on it and contributed\n> their individual and collective reviews of the\n> world.[162](part0015.html#ch2ft-162)\n\nLike détournement, it’s a matter of borrowing and correcting ready-made\nelements. In Platonov, the metaphorical substitution runs from prepared\ningredients in food preparation to text preparation:\n\n> What exactly are ready-made ingredients? Myths, historical and modern facts\n> and events, everyday activities and an ambitious or better destiny—all of\n> these which are proclaimed by thousands of mouths and hundreds of dry and\n> anonymous official papers will be ready-made components for writers, since\n> all of these are made unintentionally, genuinely, for free and by chance and\n> you cannot write better than that: this is a 100% equivalent of life that is\n> enriched by a virgin soul.\n\nLike Kathy Acker, Platonov experiments with mixing “real” and “fake”\nbiographical elements:\n\n> You write all kinds of things and improve … Your friends will ask you where\n> this is coming from. You smirk and I say that it comes from people\n> themselves. A lot of writers do a better job in telling the story than\n> writing it. I decided to experiment once and included my friend’s speech\n> into my essay. He read it and got excited but didn’t remember since I edited\n> it a bit. He still doesn’t get it that work that actually produces big\n> results just requires manual dexterity.[163](part0015.html#ch2ft-163)\n\nWriting is work for Platonov, a kind of labor, not the “life of the mind.” On\nthe contrary it is more mineral than spiritual:\n\n> Art is organically an essential part of life, just like sweating is part of\n> a human body and motion is part of wind. However, in passing within the\n> subsoil of a body, in geological layers in areas with narrow coverage of\n> human collective structures, art is not always visible and publicly\n> accessible. It is about making it visible and bringing it out of the\n> geological layers onto the surface of everyday life.\n\nLike Bogdanov, he is aware, however, that language has a peculiar kind of\nmateriality: “Words are just social materials and they are very manageable and\nreversible.”\n\nGiven how malleable words are, it is striking how the labor of transforming\nthem is still caught up in petit-bourgeois ideas of the craftsman producer, as\nif each writer could make a motor car by hand: “They still make cars by\nthemselves forgetting that there is Ford and Citroën … comparing the knowledge\nand intellect circulating in the world of builders with circles of writers—the\ncomparison is not in favor of latter.”[164](part0015.html#ch2ft-164)\n\nOne division of labor that might advance the production of literature would be\na kind of critic-engineer, whose job is not to anatomize forms, but to\nactually produce them: “the critics’ job and main mission is to develop new\nmethods for writing that simplify and improve the writers work … Critics need\nto become constructors of ‘machines’ that produce literature, and the artist\nwill work on the machines.” A second division of labor, once such a form\nexists, is between the inductive and editing labor processes. The literary\ncomponent is not the making of the words, but the editing of that product:\n“But literature is a social phenomenon and therefore it needs to be developed\nby social collective force only under the leadership and editing drive of one\nperson—the writer.”\n\nThe factory of literature works up the raw material of speech and text into\nprefabricated elements, being careful not to edit out in advance what is\n“nutritious” in it:\n\n> In every national republic or area there must be at least seven literary\n> factories. Maybe the story can be divided into sections and each factory\n> works on one section. So these literary factories are primary workshops\n> where ready-made ingredients are processed. And then this material gets\n> delivered to national literary factories that are the most experienced ones,\n> where actual writers work … However, it is not required that the literary\n> factory have excellent editing skills—that unique capacity to add something\n> to the ready-made ingredients and make an essay out of it.\n\nHere we can see how much Platonov reverses the procedure of socialist realism.\nHis imaginary factory hews close to the popular speech act, selecting and\norganizing those acts. Even the language from above is to be read back through\nthe feedback loop of what speech from below makes of it:\n\n> The national literary factories need to have all the qualities listed above\n> plus education. The material that is received from this unit gets sorted\n> into different notepads, getting it cleaned of unoriginal thoughts and ideas\n> that are not valuable for literature … The national literary factory is a\n> laboratory that controls the quality. They don’t need to add their own input\n> to these pieces. For their own ideas there is another space called\n> “accidental thoughts.”\n\nPlatonov imagines not only a whole discourse network and division of labor,\nbut also distribution of the rewards. “Honorarium should be the following: 50%\n– the writer, 5% – critic, 5% – national literary factories, 40% – literary\nfactories, for each piece published by this unit. The pieces are published\nunder the writer’s name and with the insignia of the literary factory.” The\nunpaid, precarious labor of today’s internet is in this model at least not\nentirely unacknowledged and unrewarded.\n\nTo the extent that anyone built anything like this, in the Soviet Union it was\nthe secret police, and in our time the National Security Agency. But the\ndifference is that while those textual factories attribute statements to\nindividuals to make them culpable, Platonov’s version does the reverse. The\ncirculation of language produces its effects—heretical or orthodox—in its\nspeakers, not the other way around. “This isn’t hierarchy … The most important\nbenefit of the factory is of course the division of labor and the fact that it\ncovers lots of human lives, masses and territories, thousands of eyes.” But\neyes that aren’t looking for suspects. Platonov’s factory is\nanonymous.[165](part0015.html#ch2ft-165)\n\nOf course the Factory of Literature is a fantasy, a utopia, or perhaps a meta-\nutopia, a means of making not only actual but virtual worlds out of language.\nIt is not a communist horizon but a non-Euclidian space of possibility, of\nn-dimensions, folds, forkings, and joining paths. And while it may be the case\nthat the twenty-first century has the technology to realize it, what was\nactually built is quite the opposite. Still, it remains just one of a whole\nmenagerie of living forms, possible but not actual, with which to shape what\nAnne Balsamo calls the _technological imagination_ , but one that integrates a\nunique form of workers’ inquiry, or in the era of the social factory, of mass\nobservation.[166](part0015.html#ch2ft-166)\n\nIn everyday life, language acquires a necessarily partial adhesion to whatever\nloves and labors it is made to work with. This is why the personae of\nPlatonov’s texts matter. Each embodies a given practice and the fetishisms\nspecific to that situation. Comradely life becomes possible when the rule of\nthe universal over such situations is abandoned. Such situations cannot even\nbe grouped in sets, for there is no ruling idea even of their separation and\nordering.\n\nIn _Foundation Pit_ , Voschev gathered up lost things, forgotten things,\nwasted things, things that deviated from the fantasy realism of the times.\nVoschev gleans them and keeps them in a bag, as an inventory and offering, as\na gift to another time. Perhaps it is now time to look for such gifts from\ntimes past. Here in the overdeveloped world, it is as if, in the dream of the\nseven fat decades, we forgot about the seven lean decades. We lived in and\nlooked only to the superstructures, assuming the base was too basic and vulgar\nfor our refined minds. The Carbon Liberation Front changes all such\ncalculations.\n\nThe great patrons of the critical thought of our time are still speaking\nmostly of useless things. Their words are dead to us. We find ourselves\norphaned from those other queer ancestors who, like Platonov, might speak to\nour most vulgar problems. Fortunately, it is still possible to cobble together\na kind of mad Golem that can speak to this era of metabolic rift in something\nlike the accent of the overdeveloped world, who can rail against capitalist\nrealist certainties with a quite other kind of realism, one which limns close\nto what’s there to be actually sensed.\n\n\n## [PART II  \nScience and Utopia](part0005.html#part2)\n\n\n## [3](part0005.html#ch3)\n\n## [Cyborg Donna Haraway: Techno-science Worlds and Beings](part0005.html#ch3)\n\n> California! Über alles!\n>\n> —The Dead Kennedys\n\n[THE CALIFORNIA IDEOLOGY](part0005.html#sec-18)\n\nIf [Part I](part0008.html) of _Molecular Red_ is set in a slightly mythical\nearly twentieth-century Soviet Union, [Part II](part0011.html) spirits us off\nto an even more mythical late twentieth-century California. This story too can\nbegin as a story about water, and metabolic rift. This western edge of\nAmerican Empire is a coastal plain backed by a vast mountain range, the waters\nof which have been routed through a hydraulic engineering project about as\nvast as that which drained the Aral Sea.\n\nThe centerpiece of this infrastructure, which would have staggered the\nimagination of Platonov, was built on the ruins of the Sacramento-San Joaquin\nDelta, the largest estuary in the western hemisphere. The State Water Project\nand the Central Valley Project pump water falling on the Sierra Mountains\nthrough here on its way from northern to southern California, mostly for\nagriculture, but also providing a small though crucial part of the water\nsupply for the great southern cities. Not to mention the golf courses of\nCalifornia, which between them use more water than the city of Los Angeles.\nThe water can travel 500 miles, and the whole exercise uses 5 percent of the\nstate’s electricity. It is perhaps a ruin still in slow-motion progress,\nplagued by drought and rising sea levels.[1](part0015.html#ch3ft-1)\n\nBut for now it hydrates the fresh skin of that familiar California landscape\nof suburbs and gulags, malls and freeways. Like its water infrastructure, that\nlandscape was built after the Pacific War and on Pacific trade, but also in\nlarge measure on military industries. This is where capitalist realism’s\n“California Ideology” was born. It is a feral cross between cyber-culture and\ncounter-culture, where the disruptive power of “tech” is supposed to power the\nfreeing of any and every resource for commodification. [Part\nII](part0011.html) of _Molecular Red_ is about some Californians who have been\ncritical of the California Ideology, but who did not seek any refuge from it\nin returning to the worn clichés of a bourgeois liberal\nhumanism.[2](part0015.html#ch3ft-2)\n\nAs we shall see, there’s no haven to be found in any of those romantic\nlongings for something outside of the combined powers of strategic command,\ncommodified vectors, and technological refashioning that undergird the\nCalifornia Ideology. It is no longer the case that art or literature or the\nimagination or the body or desire or the human or nature or the absolute or\neven the communist horizon could be the ethical or cultural or political\navatar of the thing-in-itself, the _locus solus_ outside the machine of the\nmilitary-entertainment complex. It has no outside, and it is accelerating.\n\nEven California’s majestic, ancient Sierra Nevada mountains no longer stand as\nmute witness to the human vanity below. They too are changing as the climate\nchanges, and irrevocably.[3](part0015.html#ch3ft-3) In the era of the Carbon\nLiberation Front, there is no way to return to a lost ecology, where that is\nunderstood as a cyclical, healing and soothing natural orderliness. The\nCalifornia coast, that most westerly edge of this new world, is no longer the\nterminus of manifest destiny.\n\nCalifornia’s _latent destiny_ is now that of which we must speak. Manifest\ndestiny had a spatial horizon, the ever-westward advance of a civilization\nthat took that very colonizing momentum as proof of its own virtue. Latent\ndestiny has a more temporal horizon. It is an undoing of that time in which\nthe future was like the present, only _more of it_. Latent destiny is a\ntemporary temporality populated by spectacles of disintegration, of glyph and\n.gif glimpses of new futures that refute old pasts. The going is getting\nweird.\n\nPacking an intellectual knapsack for clambering around the sierras of this new\nkind of unstable ‘cene is a challenging task in itself. My wager is on the\nutility of a group of writers who could be thought of as coming from the same\nbag as Bogdanov and Platonov. They might equip us with a latter-day empirio-\nmonism, tektology, and labor point of view, and even a utopian fiction for the\ntimes. [Part II](part0011.html) of _Molecular Red_ is the prep list for the\ntrek out of theories-past toward the Anthropocene present.\n\nGiven the advanced stage of the division of intellectual labor, there’s nobody\nin late twentieth-century California who attempted to write theoretically\nabout as many topics as Bogdanov, let alone in fiction as well. The writer who\ncomes closest is Donna Haraway. Certainly, the History of Consciousness\nProgram at the University of California (Santa Cruz), where she taught, is the\nclosest thing in the United States to a tektological research program. Haraway\nand her colleagues and students performed both critical and constructive work\non the way metaphorical substitutions leap between scientific, technical,\nsocial scientific, and humanistic knowledge production.\n\nBut it seems fittingly Bogdanovite to approach the creation of a latter-day\ntektology as a collaborative and collective project, rather than focus on\nHaraway’s work as a solo act—great though it is. Hence our itinerary visits\nwith one of her sources (Paul Feyerabend), then Haraway’s own work, then that\nof a colleague (Karan Barad), followed by one of Haraway’s students (Paul\nEdwards). Their respective labors allow us to update in turn Bogdanov’s\nempirio-monism, his tektology, the labor point of view, and his attempt to\nthink at the scale of the molecular and of the biosphere. I approach these\nwriters as if they were what Haraway calls _messmates_. I call the composite\nthat arises out of their breaking bread together Cyborg Haraway, as it is a\nsort of text-machine of indeterminate type that makes itself through critical\nthinking in and about the various sciences.\n\nI will firstly try to reconstruct for the era of the Carbon Liberation Front\nsomething like the Machist-Marxism of Bogdanov, but retooled for the times,\nand built out of a détournement of some writings by Paul Feyerabend. The aim\nhere is a minimalist theory that hews close to sensation and to the techniques\nthat produce it. As we shall see when we get to Paul Edwards, a knowledge of\nthe Anthropocene comes from scientific labors in fields such as climate\nscience. Thus, having a grip on this era _at all_ relies on having some\nrelation to scientific knowledge in relatively new and distinctive fields.\nThus the traditional indifference, disdain, or lordly sense of superiority of\nhumanistic knowledge to the sciences will no longer suffice. Unlikely as it\nmay seem to those who know his work, it is via Feyerabend that I think one\nmight revive a Machist-Marxist, empirio-critical approach to the sciences that\nis critical and constructive, collaborative and comradely.\n\nThe Anthropocene calls upon all the labors of our species-being. But what in\nthese times is labor? Can a concept of labor include scientific labor,\nreproductive labor, affective labor, precarious labor, even non-labor? What\nprevents twenty-first century labor from acting collectively by and for\nitself? Is it not just another kind of fetish to try to think the worker as\nsomething apart from the mesh of flesh and tech that is the composite material\nof twenty-first-century organization? Here we touch on the central node of\nthis chapter, a reading of Donna Haraway, who advances some new versions of\nwhat fetishism might mean, such as corporeal fetishism and code fetishism, via\nwhich to diagnose impediments to a twenty-first-century tektology. Here too I\nrevisit Haraway’s most famous text, “A Manifesto for Cyborgs,” as a prescient\ndocument which points toward new languages, ironic and utopian, for\narticulating a latter-day worker’s point of view.\n\nThinking about labor today, not least scientific labor, calls for a close\nattention to something that does not quite rise to the level of a concept in\nBogdanov—the _apparatus_. The highly specialized and differentiated kinds of\nlabor of the twenty-first century, particularly in the sciences, give off\nfascinating and diverse substitutional chains of metaphor, image, and diagram\nthrough which to construct basic metaphors for worldviews of far more\ngenerality than Bogdanov could ever have imagined, but also a host of new\ndangers. Here the physicist and feminist science studies professor Karan Barad\ncan help us grasp what it means to think through the apparatus and the\nsensations of modern physics, to construct a worldview whose experimental\nbases really are molecular, if not sub-atomic.\n\nBogdanov’s Socialist Academy did not come to pass, but it is curious how his\ntektology does anticipate some things about how scientific labor came to be\norganized. There is no better example of this than climate science. Here we\nlook at the work of Haraway’s former graduate student Paul Edwards, whose work\non climate science pays close attention to how it is organized both as a\ntechnical infrastructure and as a culture. In the spirit of Bogdanov, a\ngenuinely Marxist approach to the sciences has to pay close attention to the\nleading _practical_ sciences, understood through their means of production.\n\nThose are the component and interactive parts of Cyborg Haraway. This is a\nstrictly amateur, non-professional reading where the sciences are concerned,\nlooking for images, metaphors, and diagrams that might suggest augmented\nworldviews, but where such use is yet to be experimentally verified. Let’s\nreorient critical thought to a kind of comradely practice, where each kind of\nlabor or science produces its own specific worldview, extending via\nsubstitution from its particular encounters and sensations, and where none\nclaims to be the master discourse with authority over them all. It is a low\ntheory approach, moving between scientific knowledges, not a high theory\nflying high as a drone above to adjudicate, legislate, or police them.\n\nHaving assembled a Cyborg Haraway remake of empirio-monism and tektology, the\nlast chapter of _Molecular Red_ asks whether there is a role then for the\nspeculative fiction of Bogdanov’s _Red Star_ , and his anti-theological\ninsistence that writing respond to yearnings and desires for a horizon of the\nabsolute with popular fictions rather than specialized philosophies. It\nproposes the writings of Kim Stanley Robinson as an equivalent to Bogdanov’s\nutopian writing in the era of the Carbon Liberation Front.\n\nThe special virtue of Robinson’s post-Bogdanovite science fiction is that it\nis no longer about just one worldview, but about the negotiation between\nworldviews that result from different kinds of labor, scientific, technical,\npolitical, and cultural. For perhaps we need a more plural conception of\nutopian possibility to match the plurality of sensations and the worldviews of\nthe times. Rather than the endless competition between different visions of\nchanging life, the challenge might be rather to organize between them. Here a\nutopian, or perhaps _meta-utopian_ mode of writing might point the way\nforward.\n\nEarly twenty-first-century critical thought is expressing the desire for\nanother life in two main ways. One is a revival of a kind of revolutionary\nsubjectivity, a psychoanalytic Leninist sublime. The other is a kind of\nspeculative absolute, a theory purified of any merely human phenomenal\ndimension and set free in a hyper-chaotic or vitalist\ncosmos.[4](part0015.html#ch3ft-4) The former radicalizes the category of\nsubject; the latter absolutizes the category of object. What tends to get\nevacuated in both cases is the bit in the middle, the media between object and\nsubject (or whatever contemporary avatars of those ancient concepts is in\nvogue). The situation which mediates between and enables the cut that\ndelineates object from subject is where we find sensation, apparatus, and the\nlabor point of view.\n\nThis is where we build a contemporary empirio-monism, tektology, and that\ncomponent of a proletkult that might take the form of a meta-utopian fiction,\nall of which in their lowly way is where we might start to grapple with the\nAnthropocene. After working through Robinson’s conceptual personae and their\nnarrative arcs as myths for a new proletkult, we can then turn, by way of\nconclusion, to thinking how labor and nature, science and utopia, might forge\norganizational forms for the Anthropocene. But first, let’s turn to that most\nunlikely Californian—Paul Feyerabend.\n\n[FROM MACH TO FEYERABEND](part0005.html#sec-19)\n\nThe “Machist” strand of thought fell silent among the competing leftist\ntheories of the late twentieth century.[5](part0015.html#ch3ft-5) But Mach\nhimself had at least one first-rate champion in science studies. “The\nnineteenth century produced one philosopher who was not prepared to accept the\nstatus quo, who was not content to criticize science from the safe distance of\na special subject either, but who proceeded to suggest concrete means for its\nchange. The nineteenth century produced Ernst Mach.”[6](part0015.html#ch3ft-6)\nThe twentieth century produced Paul Feyerabend.\n\nWhile he was once offered a job by Bertolt Brecht, Feyerabend was always\nremote from, not to mention contemptuous of, Marxism. Feyerabend: “Is it\nsurprising that I dislike reformers like Brecht who turn the theater, one of\nthe last strongholds of magic, into a sociological\nlaboratory?”[7](part0015.html#ch3ft-7) His was more of a dadaist soul. The\nchallenge is to think forward from Feyerabend’s revival of Mach to what a more\ncontemporary strain of Machist Marxist thought, one adequate to the twenty-\nfirst century, might become. Perhaps even one with a little, but not too much,\nmagic. The question of whether Feyerabend’s Mach is the actual Mach-in-\nhimself, or only one refracted through Feyerabend’s own lens, need not detain\nus. Nor do I claim to give all that complete or accurate a resemblance of\nFeyerabend.\n\nThe Mach who colors Feyerabend’s world is the philosopher-scientist, running\ntheories through practices and vice versa. He grants science autonomy from any\nlogical construction or idealized reconstruction. Science is as science does;\na knowledge without foundation. The scientist is not someone with access to a\nspecial portal to the real, and the knowledge he (yes he for now, we shall\ncome back to that) creates can be connected to other kinds of knowledge\npractice, and other kinds of knowledge\npractitioners.[8](part0015.html#ch3ft-8)\n\nFeyerabend’s thought anticipates more of a democratic than a proletarian\nknowledge. He had a keen sense of science as an alibi for colonial power, but\nhis sense of how class and capital work in knowledge production is\nrudimentary. The quality of his work is elsewhere. He wanted to demystify\nscience, to open the possibility of critique to science as a whole. He wanted\na way to move across the divisions of labor within not only science but\nknowledge more generally. There is no unthinking border between science and\nfolk knowledge, sentience and sapience.\n\nNot many people other than Mach could dilate with such verve about “the awful\nNewton,” who is not a scientific hero to Feyerabend, but rather someone who\nset the pattern for science as a mode of authority, as a _discipline_ in its\ncreeping senses.[9](part0015.html#ch3ft-9) But at least the scientific\nrevolution of the seventeenth century involved a close collaboration of\nscience and philosophy. Things really went wrong when philosophy became\nseparate, and started to produce its own problems, or when it specialized in\ncodifying science without a reciprocal relation to it (particularly with\nKant). By defining the limits of the reasoning subject, philosophy claims to\nground science by specifying the conditions under which the phenomenal object\nof knowledge correlates with a thinking subject.[10](part0015.html#ch3ft-10)\n\nRecall that Bogdanov read these symptoms in slightly different terms. Idealist\nphilosophy practiced a mode of substitution that privileged the experiences of\nintellectual labor. Its problems were the problems of overcoming the\norganization of the subjective element, rather than more “objective” ones.\nCuriously, Feyerabend, like Bogdanov, had a preference for sticking closer to\nthose philosophers for whom the organizing of perceptions of the objective\nworld were closer to hand. They land on one of the same figures in such a\ncounter-history of Western thought: Ernst Mach.\n\nWith the benefit of a little more hindsight, Feyerabend is clearer than\nBogdanov that Mach’s influence has not always been beneficial. Feyerabend\ndefends Mach’s practice, not his theory. Reifying his theory, as Mach himself\nand certainly Bogdanov sometimes do, could only lead thought astray. What\nmatters is that Mach connected philosophy-as-practice back to science-as-\npractice. As a scientist he was able to treat all of science’s components—its\ntheories, methods, apparatus, and results—as available for critical\nsuspension. Science works on the play between all of these\nelements.[11](part0015.html#ch3ft-11)\n\nMost of us are inclined to agree that there is a real world beyond our minds,\neven if the really-real aspects of it may be hidden from us. The problem with\nsuch—broadly—realist approaches to either science or philosophy is that they\nfix a boundary between object and subject in advance. Some object, whether\napparent or hidden, is real. Some subject, perhaps aided by some special\nmethod, apprehends it. This diagram can be a complicated one, with all kinds\nof faculties and forms, but something remains unthought in assuming in advance\nthat there is _this_ object and _this_ subject.\n\nParticularly troubling for such realisms are _mediating_ phenomena. Something\nhas to go on at the boundary between the object world and subjective\ncognition. Such phenomena trouble the structure of the concepts which cluster\nand encrust a prior decision, separating object and subject at some arbitrary\npoint. To use a language very foreign to Feyerabend, such mediating phenomena\nmight even _deconstruct_ the givenness of object and\nsubject.[12](part0015.html#ch3ft-12)\n\nAn alternative starting point might be to take the mediation, the stuff\nbetween the object and subject, to be what at first glance or grasp is most\nreal. But it is only a starting hypothesis, not a first philosophy: start by\ntreating phenomena as in some sense that which is real. Mach called these\nphenomena _sensations_ , but they are not reducible to subjective sense\nimpressions, contrary to what Lenin and many other critics of Mach\nassume.[13](part0015.html#ch3ft-13)\n\nRather than posit in advance that there are objects behind the sensations\nwhich a subject apprehends, Mach asks a prior question: what are these\nsensations that end up being parceled out into the subjective and objective?\nWhat is the activity that chunks sensation into an index of some object, on\nthe one hand, and as traces via which a subject might come to assert its own\nseparateness, on the other? Inquiry might begin then with the apparent reality\nof sensations, and an attempt to assay the most simple and regular connections\nbetween elements of sensations.\n\nThis treatment of phenomena as real is a tactic for Feyerabend rather than a\ndogma. It does not preclude the possibility of touching on a real, external,\neven alien world. It is simply a matter of wanting to tack close to practices\nwhere the existence of such things can actually be established. Mach used this\n_tactical monism of sensation_ against the physics and philosophy of his time,\nwhich insisted too strongly on a version of a metaphysical real that could not\nbe assayed and tested, and was likely to be a barrier to further knowledge. In\nBogdanovian terms, metaphysics was then a resistance to overcome in organizing\ninquiry.\n\nSensations are not an absolute. Sensations are to be parsed into elements and\nconnections. Hence the title of Mach’s book, _The Analysis of Sensations_ ,\nwhere Mach adopts a realism, the realism of sensations—and then applies\nit.[14](part0015.html#ch3ft-14) He introduces the working rule that sciences\nshould contain only those concepts that can be connected to sensations. Hence\nhis objection to metaphysical ideas, such as Newton’s, of absolute space and\ntime. These are ways of describing a noumenal world, beyond phenomena, beyond\nsensation, but which are merely philosophical and cannot be tested.\nFeyerabend:\n\n> Mach develops the outlines of a knowledge without foundations. He introduces\n> cosmological hypotheses as temporary measuring sticks of criticism. The\n> cosmological hypothesis he appeals to most frequently assumes that all our\n> knowledge is related to sensations. Using this hypothesis he criticizes\n> physical theories such as … Newtonian mechanics. The cosmological criticism\n> is strengthened by a more specific examination and by the suggestion of\n> alternatives. In this way Mach achieves unity between science and philosophy\n> that has been lost as the result of the dominance of Newton’s physics and\n> his philosophy.[15](part0015.html#ch3ft-15)\n\nBut Mach’s would-be inheritors, such as the logical positivists of the Vienna\ncircle, lost this unity again. For them, sensation primacy becomes a dogma.\nThey mistook the tactic of deploying specific hypotheses in particular\ncircumstances for a generalizable method. In Bogdanov’s terms, what they\nlacked was the point of view of scientific and technical labor which still\nimbues Mach’s whole approach. Science is not an object of philosophical\ncontemplation to Mach. It is something at which certain people, including\nhimself, have to work.\n\nIt is not for philosophy to extract from past science its universal\nprinciples, with a view to imposing them on the future. Feyerabend is a\ndissenter from that moment when the critique of actual science was replaced\nwith either its logical construction or idealized reconstruction. Such\nprocedures relied on a selective reading of scientific results or on\nscientists’ self-reporting, after the fact, of their methods. His main object\nof attack was his own teacher, Sir Karl Popper, but the various\nepistemological edicts which dog Western Marxism all through the twentieth\ncentury attracted his ire in a passing fashion as\nwell.[16](part0015.html#ch3ft-16)\n\nThe one thing a Marxist theory of knowledge could not be in that long dark\ncentury was “positivist,” and Mach was held loosely to be—at best—an example\nof such. But Mach’s writings on physics show an approach to knowledge that is\nnot dogmatically positivist. What he calls “instinctive” principles play a\nlarge role, and not least because they may be in productive conflict with\nparticular empirical facts. Sometimes the facts have to adapt to the\nprinciples. Facts sometimes need to be extracted from the rather particular\ncircumstances in which they are produced. The natural sciences are not then\nalways inductive. Abstraction and imagination are key practices. Mach:\n“grasping nature by imagination must precede understanding so that our\nconcepts may have a lively and intuitive content.”[17](part0015.html#ch3ft-17)\nIdeas do not follow facts; ideas and facts adapt to each other.\n\nMach did not think that the psychological domain of thoughts, feelings,\ndesires, could know itself by itself, but he did think that research which\ntraces the physical connections could bring thought closer to knowledge of\nitself. His methods are hybrid methods: knowledge of the physical world should\ntake account of psychological factors; knowledge of psychology should take\naccount of physical factors. These mixed methods have a critical function, of\nbracketing off the fixed assumptions of the division of subject from object,\nmind from matter, body from soul, not to mention certain divisions of\nintellectual labor. In the sciences it has the merit of putting under critical\npressure the faith in an absolute external world. In humanistic knowledge, it\nhas the reciprocal merit of critical leverage on the assumption that the\nreasoning subject alone is the guarantor of knowledge.\n\nMach did take his distance from a kind of naive faith in a real external\nworld, which Feyerabend finds even in amazingly talented scientists such as\nPlanck and Einstein. This faith is a kind of supplement or double of the\npositivist elements in their accounts of their method. If one imagines in a\npositivist fashion that knowledge starts inductively, with disorganized\nimpressions, then among those impressions must be, in no matter how distorted\nor indirect a fashion, impressions of a noumenal world that is absolutely\nreal.\n\nMach has no such faith. His “instinct” works in particular historical\nsituations, with results from this or that particular apparatus. Rather than\nattribute theoretical leaps to “creativity,” to some humanist derivative of\ndivine inspiration, he asks a more immediately “realist” kind of question:\nwhat concrete situations produce such instinctive substitutions? One could\ncall this détournement, or tektology. Feyerabend thinks it’s a species of dada\ncollage method.[18](part0015.html#ch3ft-18) Perhaps all of these are ways of\nthinking an historical, and in a sense materialist, approach to the production\nof novelty in the domain of knowledge. Novelty comes from instinct, which\nmediates between previously separate domains of inquiry.\n\nCuriously, the apparent lack of immediate foundation for an instinct in\nspecific experiments, conducted in known ways, is what lends it a certain\nstrange authority. Instincts appear independent of our actions and beliefs,\neven if they are the product of determinate historical circumstances. They\nusually appear to negate particular assumptions. They emerge more often in\nsituations where the researcher has some contact with a wide range of\nscientific, technical, and labor processes, and is able to intuit something\nthat cuts across their specificity. This is what Bogdanov, rather than\nFeyerabend, would stress about Mach: that instinct might be a matter of the\nspeculative substitution of an idea from an adjacent work in progress to the\none at hand.\n\nMach famously held out against the theory of the atom, and this often counts\nagainst him in retrospective accounts of the outbreak of revolutionary\nphilosophy-physics around the turn of the century. Feyerabend defends him on\nthis: “There is no need to discredit Mach for his unwavering opposition to\natoms. For the mechanical atom of the nineteenth century has indeed\ndisappeared from the scene.”[19](part0015.html#ch3ft-19) This atomism was not\nso much a physics as a metaphysics. This atom was a noumenal rather than\nphenomenal thing, an absolute thing-in-itself rather than a theory about\nparticular sensations.\n\nRather than reject atomic theory outright, Mach made it a provisional\nsubstitution. To be useful, atomic theory had to become phenomenal rather than\nnoumenal. This is exactly what Einstein achieved: a reformulation of physics\nin ways that would meet Mach’s objections. Whatever Mach himself may have\nthought, Einstein’s special theory of relativity is “Machist,” not in\ncorresponding to some dogmatic theory of knowledge, but in the sense that in\nthis case Einstein works the way Mach works, for example by suspending belief\nin an absolute noumenal time.[20](part0015.html#ch3ft-20) In the subsequent\ndebates about quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr will deploy Machist tactics\nagainst Einstein.\n\nFor Feyerabend, there is no royal road to science. Incorrect ideas can lead to\ngood experiments, theories can succeed even when they don’t account for\nsignificant facts. As he notoriously put it: “anything\ngoes.”[21](part0015.html#ch3ft-21) Or so the actual history of science would\nappear to a rationalist, including those Marxists, who, like Lukács and\nAlthusser, think there are special methods, and that the philosophers are\ntheir guardians. Feyerabend makes a useful counterpoint to those versions of\nWestern Marxism that were obsessed with coming up with a correct exposition of\ndialectical materialist method, and which thought that philosophy had some\nprivileged, legislative role in adjudicating what that method ought to be.\n\nLet’s think Marxism then as a heterogeneous collection of rhetorics, theories,\nmethods, results. It is a labyrinthine archive of conceptual personae whose\nhidden riches may well lie in unexplored aisles. In the absence of a secret\npolice, it no longer has an orthodoxy, regardless of how orthodox some in that\narchive might have wanted to consider themselves. Haraway: “I want to know how\nto help build ongoing stories rather than histories that end. In that sense,\nmy kinships are about keeping the lineages going, even while defamiliarizing\ntheir members and turning lines into webs, trees into esplanades, and\npedigrees into affinity groups.”[22](part0015.html#ch3ft-22)\n\nThis would queer a certain precious heirloom from the Marxological cupboard.\nLukács:\n\n> Let us assume for the sake of argument that recent research had disproved\n> once and for all every one of Marx’s individual theses. Even if this were to\n> be proved, every serious “orthodox” Marxist would still be able to accept\n> all such modern findings without reservation and hence dismiss all of Marx’s\n> theses in toto—without having to renounce his orthodoxy for a single moment.\n> Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the\n> results of Marx’s investigations. It is not the “belief” in this or that\n> thesis, nor the exegesis of a “sacred” book. On the contrary, orthodoxy\n> refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that\n> dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be\n> expanded and deepened only along the lines laid down by its\n> founders.[23](part0015.html#ch3ft-23)\n\nIn relation to dogmatic insistence on the truth of Marx’s results, this\nvenerable passage might still seem like progress, but in place of it is a\ndogmatic privileging of method. Gone is the putting to work of all of the\nelements against each other, of facts and theories, intuitions and\nsubstitutions. In Bogdanov’s terms, it is knowledge as authority; it is\nphilosophy as high theory. Philosophy rules! It is not a comradely effort at\ncollaboration through experimental substitution between particular efforts.\n\nIt is not often noticed that Lukács elaborates this theory-dominant approach\nin opposition not just to the positivism of the “vulgar Marxists,” but also\nagainst the “Machists,” whose thought-crime is different: a comradely equality\nof different modes of inquiry. The problem with the Machists, says Lukács, is\nthat for them reality is “impenetrable, fatalistic and\nimmutable.”[24](part0015.html#ch3ft-24) They concede too much to nature’s\nresistance, to the objectivity of particular sciences, and they do not\nrecognize that science is merely a “weapon of the bourgeoisie.” They refuse\nthe philosopher’s top-down causality of the totality, and limit themselves to\nthe bottom-up procedure of working collaboratively from the particular\nsciences and labors. Lukács sees the Machists as a product of the decline of\nbourgeois self-confidence that its thought adequately described the world,\nalthough unlike Bogdanov, the Lukács of the 1920s does not seem to know very\nmuch about actual sciences.\n\nFeyerabend had a strong dislike for philosophy as a totalizing and controlling\nkind of discourse. He much preferred it when it was connected to what Platonov\ncalled secondary ideas, or rather practices, which have to encounter the\nresistance of the world’s materiality. Thought had no value to him without the\nstruggle of life. He detested the attitude of both philosopher-kings and\nphilosopher-commissars, as any genuine radical must. Feyerabend:\n\n> To me this attitude is alien, incomprehensible and slightly sinister. True,\n> I, too, once admired the phenomenon from afar; I hoped to enter the castles\n> from whence it spread and to participate in the wars of enlightenment the\n> learned knights had started all over the world. Eventually I noticed the\n> more pedestrian aspects of the matter: the fact, that is, that the\n> knights—the professors—serve masters who pay them and tell them what to do:\n> they are not free minds in search of harmony and happiness for all, they are\n> civil servants … and their mania for order is not the result of a balanced\n> inquiry, or of closeness to humanity, it is a professional disease. So while\n> I made full use of the sizeable salaries I got for doing very little, I was\n> careful to protect the poor humans (and, in Berkeley, dogs, cats, raccoons,\n> even a monkey now and then) who came to my lectures from the disease.\n\nThus spake the philosopher in the land of the lotus-eaters. Feyerabend is\nuseful for keeping critical thought once again from getting lost in the misty\ndomains of the speculative realisms or the void, vibrating, or vitalist\nmaterialisms of high theory. He isn’t much help for bringing it closer to what\nactually became of the metabolic control of molecular processes on the planet,\nand their ever widening rift. If Feyerabend can help us reanimate the corpus\nof Mach for the twenty-first century, then who can help us do the same for\nMarx? Here we turn to a very different kind of Californian thinker and writer,\nwith whom Feyerabend shares a fondness for dogs and primates, if nothing else.\n\n[FROM MARX TO HARAWAY](part0005.html#sec-20)\n\nIt is hard to imagine a landscape more remote from Russia in the early\ntwentieth century than the West Coast of the United States in the late\ntwentieth century. In place of scarcity, a bright abundance. Some central\nnodes to the military industrial complex were born and grew there,\nparticularly in the aerospace industry, not to mention the Air Force’s own\nprivate think-tank, the RAND corporation. And as California prospered, so did\nits finest universities, such as Stanford and Caltech and Berkeley, not to\nmention Berkeley’s rivals at the peak of the public University of California\nsystem. Pump enough Pentagon money into this cluster of institutions and the\nresult is Silicon Valley.[25](part0015.html#ch3ft-25)\n\nIt is hard to imagine an organization of knowledge and labor more remote from\nwhat Bogdanov was proposing at the Socialist University after the Bolsheviks\ncame to power, or even from that extensive and effective apparatus that the\nSoviet Union actually constructed after Stalin\ndied.[26](part0015.html#ch3ft-26) But in its own terms, the Californian\nmilitary-industrial complex worked. It is not too much of an exaggeration to\nsay that the dominant forms of power, economy, even of human life, owe their\nexistence to what Donna Haraway calls the _techno-science_ that issued from a\nhandful of research universities in the Cold War years. It was not pure\nserendipity that brought Paul Feyerabend to Berkeley to teach the philosophy\nof science in the midst of an astonishing flowering of both pure and applied\nscience. The term techno-science highlights how implicated science is and was\nin particular moments in the history of technology.\n\nFeyerabend’s grasp of this part of the picture was never strong. Perhaps he\nwas fatally hampered by his endemic hatred of all things Marxist. Perhaps the\nnew world would not reveal its workings to someone so touched by the old. More\nuseful in this regard is the work of Donna Haraway. Born in the 1940s, trained\nas a biologist, radicalized during the Vietnam War years, and lodging at the\nUniversity of California at Santa Cruz in 1980, Haraway is, on her own\nadmission, a product of both Cold War techno-science and the struggle in and\nagainst its imperial consequences. Haraway: “I have a body and mind as much\nconstructed by the post-Second World War arms race and cold war as by the\nwomen’s movements.”[27](part0015.html#ch3ft-27)\n\nIf for Bogdanov the catalyst that diverted him from the life sciences was the\nlabor movement, for Haraway it was feminism. Haraway: “Feminists re-\nappropriate science in order to discover and to define what is ‘natural’ for\nourselves. A human past and future would be placed in our hands. This avowedly\ninterested approach to science promises to take seriously the rules of\nscientific discourse without worshipping the fetish of scientific\nobjectivity.”[28](part0015.html#ch3ft-28)\n\nThere is an interesting tension here, even a productive one. With some\nstartling exceptions such as Shulamith Firestone’s _Dialectic of Sex_ , most\nstrands of Western Marxism taken up by critical thinkers in the United States\nin the postwar period were allergic to techno-\nscience.[29](part0015.html#ch3ft-29) Even among radical social scientists of\nthis period, knowledge of, and commitment to, some version of natural science\nas a mode of inquiry was rare, and where it existed it was not often combined\nwith such a strong commitment to a thoroughgoing critique of the existing form\nof science.[30](part0015.html#ch3ft-30)\n\nHaraway’s is a very different intellectual formation to the one that grew out\nof the influence of Herbert Marcuse, who taught at the other end of California\nto Haraway, in San Diego, from 1965 until he was forced to retire in\n1970.[31](part0015.html#ch3ft-31) While there are détournements of Lukács and\nMarcuse in Haraway, they are very much applied to understanding two immediate\nphenomena: new kinds of techno-science, and the rising social movement of\nfeminism. What formed at the juncture was feminist science\nstudies.[32](part0015.html#ch3ft-32)\n\nScience? Technology? Goddess preserve us! There are plenty of feminisms that\ntry to take their stand against techno-science from without, as if it had some\nprior and given claim to speak for nature. Haraway: “Feminist theory has\nrepeatedly replicated this ‘naturalizing’ structure of discourse in its own\noppositional constructions.”[33](part0015.html#ch3ft-33) A useful attribute of\nfeminist science studies is that it tends not to make the assumption that\nthere is something inherently radical about philosophy, or culture, or play or\npoetry over and against the scientific and technical. It does not take sides\nin advance within the existing intellectual division of labor. It is, among\nother things, a practical critique of that division of intellectual labor.\n“Destabilizing the positions in a discursive field and disrupting categories\nfor identification might be a more powerful feminist strategy than ‘speaking\nas a woman.’”[34](part0015.html#ch3ft-34)\n\nIt retains a sort of double discomfort, asking critical questions in a\nscientific zone, and speaking knowledgeably about actual sciences in a\nhumanities zone. This is irritating, and usefully so. Feminist science studies\npersistently recasts the objectivity claims of the sciences, and does so, to\nmake it worse, without dismissing the scientific endeavor. It is so much\nharder to dismiss a critic who takes a knowledge practice seriously, who wants\nnot to abandon objectivity, but wants a stronger one, grounded in making a\nmore extensive series of mediating links in the production of knowledge\navailable for scrutiny.[35](part0015.html#ch3ft-35)\n\nThis is irritating in another way as well. Haraway: “Marx insisted that one\nmust not leap too fast, or one will end up in a fantastic utopia, impotent and\nignorant. Abundance … is essential to the full discovery and historical\npossibility of human nature. It matters whether we make ourselves in plenty or\nunfulfilled need, including need for genuine knowledge and\nmeaning.”[36](part0015.html#ch3ft-36) This is what Platonov knew from daily\nexperience. Surplus feeds the body which feeds the soul. There can be no\nretreat into the superstructures when there is no food, shelter or safety. The\nproduction and reproduction of our species-being, whatever it may be, has to\nbe a central concern of any critical knowledge. Given the rising inequality,\npoverty, and hunger in twenty-first-century California, to which the state has\nresponded by mirroring its great universities with a series of equally great\nprisons, questions of material need that were so palpable to Platonov return\nat the heart of the empire.[37](part0015.html#ch3ft-37)\n\nHaraway’s California is that part that is still a land of surplus, where some\nmore complex questions about food arise other than its insufficiency. Haraway\ntells two archetypal California stories about food. On arriving in Santa Cruz\nin 1980, she is plunged into a debate about what to do with the placenta after\na “natural” childbirth. Should it be eaten? How should it be cooked? Who\nshould eat it? Can vegans eat human placenta? Maybe vegans ought to be obliged\nto eat it: not only was no animal killed in its making, one was brought into\nthe world of the living. In the second story, a religious studies professor\nprepares a meal for the department party, the centerpiece of which is a feral\npig he shot with an arrow. Complex debates ensue about ritual, ethics,\nimpossible ecologies, and so on.[38](part0015.html#ch3ft-38)\n\nBoth stories are like metonymic fragments of Marx’s metabolic rift.\nMolecules—in this case proteins—lack enclosing loops back through any sort of\ndynamic equilibrium. Haraway eschews any easy answers on either of these\nquestions, and makes a wry nod to “the contradictory, thick quality of what we\nmean when we say ‘California.’”[39](part0015.html#ch3ft-39) They are all the\nsame real questions. If for Platonov the question of a surplus to feed body\nand soul was a matter of quantity, in California the uneven conquest of\nquantity reveals the qualitative problems. Here in a contemporary, ramified\nform, is Bogdanov’s tragedy of the totality, a vast yet molecular process that\nonly reveals its contours when something goes wrong, when there is a metabolic\nrift, of which there are now many, from feral pigs to feral carbon.\n\nWhat is of interest in feminist science studies that is in some ways\nreminiscent of Bogdanov is a commitment to studying the reality of the process\nof the production and reproduction of knowledge. There is some progress to be\nmade by weaving Bogdanov back into the fabric of critical approaches to\nscientific and technical knowledge, of which feminist science studies is now a\nleading exemplar. This is not, let me hasten to add, an attempt to subsume\nfeminist science studies under the head of the Great Man who precedes it;\nquite the opposite. It is that there may be modest contributions Bogdanov can\nmake to supplement Haraway and her messmates.\n\nHaraway has on occasion described herself as an illegitimate daughter of Marx,\nand “something of an unreconstructed and dogged Marxist.” She remains\nattentive to how relations congeal into apparently natural things. “Property\nis the kind of relationality that poses as the thing-in-itself, the commodity,\nthe thing outside relationship, the thing that can be exhaustively measured,\nmapped, owned, appropriated, disposed.”[40](part0015.html#ch3ft-40) As we\nshall see, this becomes in her work a useful starting point for understanding\nhow distinctly twenty-first-century modes of property and technology are\norganized.\n\nUnlike many other Marxists, Haraway insists on including nonhuman actors in\nwhat would be an otherwise relentlessly human category of that-which-labors.\n“The actors are not all ‘us.’”[41](part0015.html#ch3ft-41) Techno-science\nexplodes the already wobbly partition between object and subject, nature and\nculture, apparatus and labor. Marx may have shown how the thing is full of\nlabor, but the category of chimerical objects, those mash-ups of flesh-tech,\nhas much expanded, even if there is still a tendency for the fetish of the\nthing to obscure the relations of its making. Hence the world can now appear\nas a vast accumulation not just of commodities or spectacles but of “big data”\nor “selfish genes.”\n\nMarx was already well aware of capital’s “unnatural” acts, causing something\nto reproduce in new ways, on its own terms. He even puts the figure of the\nvampire to work.[42](part0015.html#ch3ft-42) Capital is a vampire, sucking\nlife out of labor to make and remake its own undead carcass. Bogdanov nods to\nthis vampire figure of capital too, but for Haraway it’s a more polymorphous\nfigure. The vampire is both threat and promise: blood-sucking capital but also\nthe marginal other of “impure” sexual and racial mixing. Like Bogdanov,\nHaraway is always showing how the metaphors embedded in knowledge do their\nwork, but she is also interested in what other work they might do.\n\nHaraway tries to keep in view the relations of production that the fetish of\nthe commodity obscures. “I believe wealth is created by collective practice,\nfigured by Marx as labor, but needing a messier metaphoric descriptive\nrepertoire.”[43](part0015.html#ch3ft-43) There is a fetishism of labor\nitself—man-with-hammer—that needs attending to as well. If, like Bogdanov, one\ntakes the labor point of view to be what is central to Marx’s work, then what,\nin the age of techno-science, might now constitute such a point of view?\n\nIf Marx proceeded through a critique of the dismal science of political\neconomy, Haraway works through a rather more lively if no less difficult\nscience—biology. “I have always read biology in a double way—as about the way\nthe world works biologically, but also about the way the world works\nmetaphorically.”[44](part0015.html#ch3ft-44) One of the many functions of\nbiology is to “discursively reproduce the species,” defining the limits of\nwhat can be said about the potentials of the human, about our species-being.\nIs there a “human race,” or are some races not fully human? And if all races\nare human, what might the human become?\n\nHaraway tries to untangle the matrix of figures of nature, nation, sex, race,\nand blood that both impinge on biological science but which are also centrally\nproduced and modified in biology. It is not that biology is reducible to\nculture and politics, rather, “the material-semiotic tissues are inextricably\nintermeshed.”[45](part0015.html#ch3ft-45) Haraway expands the object of\nMarxian critique from political economy to the life sciences, which are no\nless implicated in the production of the infrastructural givens of the\ncontemporary commodified world. This adds an essential dimension, if critique\nis going to grasp—such a primate metaphor!—Marx’s no less full-bodied metaphor\nof metabolic rift, and flesh it out.\n\nHere the job might be to refract Haraway through Bogdanov, to show that there\nhave been three basic metaphors of the causality of the human in the modern\nperiod: race, population, and gene. Each has its dissenters, critics, and\nutopian or dystopian writers.[46](part0015.html#ch3ft-46) Each has its genuine\nscientists caught up in substitutions drawn from social organization which\ncolor and overshoot the process of producing evidence. Each also has its\nideologues and moral entrepreneurs.\n\n_Race causality_ held that accumulated cultural differences are somehow\ncarried in the blood. Even among progressives, the very category of race could\ncreate a fear of race mixing. Haraway: “The evolution of language, the\nprogress of technology, the perfection of the body, and the advance of social\nforms seemed to be aspects of the same fundamental human science. That science\nwas constitutively physiological and hierarchical, organismic and wholist,\nprogressivist and developmental.”[47](part0015.html#ch3ft-47)\n\nBogdanov’s intervention within this regime is a queer one. He seemed to accept\nthat blood carries differences, but advocated the _sharing_ of blood to\novercome them.[48](part0015.html#ch3ft-48) Rather than be prey to the vampire\nof capital, labor shares among its own, as if the brotherhood of man could be\nmade physically so through blood exchanges. There’s a will to sameness at work\nhere which is a usefully perverse read on the obsessions of the era, but which\nremain of their era.\n\nA more common response was the welter of attempts to categorize and\ncharacterize the races, arranged in some sort of hierarchy. Differences of\nculture or power become expressions of an order of nature. Haraway: “No wonder\nuniversal nature has been a less than appealing entity for those who were not\nits creators and its beneficiaries.”[49](part0015.html#ch3ft-49) To which one\nmight add that the temptation to overcome a supposed biological destiny of\nrace, by severing the social from biological being altogether, is and remains\na powerful temptation. It has the unfortunate side-effect of cutting critical\nthought off from thinking biology as a techno-science with powerful and\nperhaps increasing abilities to create new unequal relations for the\nproduction and reproduction of life.\n\nWhile popular racialism lives on, the substituting of racial for other kinds\nof difference did not survive in biological science. In the postwar years,\nafter the debacle of racialized Nazi biology, and in the wake of new research\nmethods, the basic metaphor of _population causality_ arose in its place. A\npopulation is a semi-permeable group within a species. There may be as much\nvariation within a population as between. Each may nevertheless be a pool\nwhich contain adaptations that are more or less successful.\n\nPopulations are not types in a hierarchy; nor are they sets. Each is\nconstantly in flux in changing environments, rather like Bogdanovite\ningressions. The metaphysical shift is from a hierarchy of self-same types,\nwhere miscegenation at the boundary produces less viable instances, toward a\ndifferent way of figuring difference and similarity. Populations are\ninternally differentiated but formally equivalent in relation to each other.\n\nPopulation became a central figure in the modern synthesis, which brought\ntogether naturalists, geneticists, and experimentalists in a new kind of\nbiological science and culture. Haraway: “This was a scientific humanism that\nemphasized flexibility, progress, cooperation, and\nuniversalism.”[50](part0015.html#ch3ft-50) It broke with the language of race\nand blood. It stressed the flexible and plastic nature of the human condition,\nand its capacity to change through education. The human can be socially self-\nconstructing. Actual differences in power, such as the colonial relation, are\nelided by what ought to be: the “family of man.”\n\nThe organizational challenges of postwar capitalism put on the agenda the\nquestion of the limits to the adaptive nature of the human. Primate studies\nbecame a way of conducting experiments and building theories aimed at the\nadaptation of the human to the rising complexity of technics and organization.\nPrimate researchers focused on two linked topics: sex and dominance. The male\nprimate fights with other males for access to reproduction. Researchers\nsubstituted Freud into the animal realm and back again. Alongside interest in\nobserving primates in their “natural” setting were experiments on the primate\nas an embodiment of drives to sex and power, designed to see how adaptable its\nspecies-being was to the office politics of living in cages and pressing\nlevers for food.\n\nThe primate was an experimental subject who could yield insights into\ntechniques for regulating sexuality and power in the modern world for human\nprimates too. Rather than repressing desire or the will to power, technologies\nand therapies could help the human primate adapt. It’s a small step from the\nstudy of primate behaviors to the hormones that supposedly regulate them, and\nthen on to the construction of a techno-science of intervening in the hormonal\nregulation of primate sexuality—particularly that of humans. The contraceptive\npill is here the great techno-science success story.\n\nPopulation causality naturalized the patriarchal family. Its origin myth is\nthat of man the hunter. It is man who is assumed to be the maker of tools, the\ninventor of elaborated social organization and hence of language. It is man\nwho is curious, who explores, while woman stays home yanking yams from the\ndirt with babies on her teats. This figure was supplemented rather belatedly\nby woman the inventor of basket-weaving, in some cases as a result of the work\nof feminist researchers.\n\nHaraway has paid particularly close attention to the role of field studies of\nnatural primate populations in legitimating some elements of the family of man\nstory. The figures of the headman, the sexual division of labor, woman as\nburdened by children, all pass back and forth from science to culture as\nsubstituted figures. Through a study of the basic metaphor of biological\neconomy, Haraway hones her critique of the foundations of postwar American\nliberalism.\n\nLiberalism’s finest hour was its efforts to overcome, in both science and\nculture, the benighted effects of the category of race. Haraway wants to push\non from that self-congratulatory ethos. “I believe that this capacity of\nreproducing the Same, in culpable innocence of its historical, power-charged\nspecificity, characterizes not just me but people formed like me, who are\nliberal, scientific, and progressive …”[51](part0015.html#ch3ft-51) The\nproblem with the liberal family of man is that “what’s not collected in a\nreproductive family story does not finally count as human. For all the …\nemphasis on difference, this is the grammar of indifference, or the\nmultiplication of sameness.”[52](part0015.html#ch3ft-52) Tautology reigns:\nthat which survives is functional; that which is functional survives.\n\nThe liberal family of man gave way to the neoliberal “selfish gene” of\nsociobiology, and the basic metaphor of _gene causality_. The population\nregime took as its units of thought individual bodies and their social groups.\nNow the gene becomes the controlling code which uses both bodies and groups\nfor its own ends. The causal metaphor is still functional, but the unit to\nwhich it applies is now molecular: the gene that survives is functional\nbecause the function of the gene is to survive. Haraway: “Sociobiology is\nnarratively a hyper-functionalism and a hyper-\nliberalism.”[53](part0015.html#ch3ft-53) Genes are logos in the market of\nlife. “My genes, my self, my investment, my future. It’s much more strictly\ncapitalist.”[54](part0015.html#ch3ft-54)\n\nSuch a science is the product not only of a certain naturalizing of the\nexchange economy, but also of powerful technologies which produce the gene\nitself as an artifact in a database. Haraway: “something peculiar happened to\nthe stable, family-loving, Mendelian gene when it passed into a database\n…”[55](part0015.html#ch3ft-55) The gene becomes one of the units of currency\nof the era of “big data.” Genomics and informatics merge. The gene can exist\nin a variety of media, from software to wetware, and some in between. Nature\nstarts to yield not the authoritarian causality of race hierarchies or\npatriarchal families, but the exchange causality of property in a purified\nform.\n\nThe genetic database is at once about the genes of specific individuals, but\nalso sub-units of that code, and at the other extreme, about our species-\nbeing. The design of such a database shapes what can be compared, what kinds\nof labor can most easily be performed, but meanwhile the gene becomes a thing\nseparated from a totality and accorded its own\nagency.[56](part0015.html#ch3ft-56) Meanwhile sub-disciplines of biological\nscience, such as genetics or population biology, start to fork off and\ncoalesce around much more differentiated apparatus, practices, and objects of\nknowledge.\n\nThe construction of the gene as an object of techno-science is just one\ncomponent in an important shift in the practices of substitution between\norganizational levels. Haraway:\n\n> Nineteenth-century scientists materially constituted the organism as a\n> laboring system, structured by a hierarchical division of labor, and an\n> energetic system fueled by sugars and obeying the laws of thermodynamics.\n> For us, the living world has become a command, control, communication,\n> intelligence system … in an environment that demands strategies of flexible\n> accumulation. Artificial life programs, as well as carbon-based life\n> programs, work that way. These issues are about metaphor and representation,\n> but they are about much more than that.[57](part0015.html#ch3ft-57)\n\nIdeology, as Bogdanov well knew, is productive. The shift from thinking\norganization as energy systems alone—as Bogdanov himself does—to thinking in\nterms of a combination of energy and information systems, enables not only new\nkinds of science, technology, and power, but also opens up a space for their\ncritique.\n\nInterestingly, some of the new modes of substitution producing both ideology\nand knowledge might no longer be metaphorical so much as algorithmic. Haraway\nsees in genetic code and computer code a new kind of fetishism that is partly,\nbut not entirely, legible to the old Marxist and Freudian\nversions.[58](part0015.html#ch3ft-58) One might call it the fetish of the\nprogram, a new kind of _code causality_ , of which gene causality is but one\ninstance. It is not entirely reducible to either authoritarian or exchange\ncausality, although it has features of both. It is certainly not the comradely\ncausal universe that Bogdanov and Platonov imagined.\n\nBy way of illustration, Haraway points to an issue of _Mammalian Genome_ ,\nwhich offered its readers a representation of the contents of the chromosomes\nof a mouse under the headline, “the Complete Mouse (some assembly\nrequired).”[59](part0015.html#ch3ft-59) Code becomes the master layer in the\nstacked protocols by which an organization is managed. In genetics, code\nbecomes the part via which a whole can be reductively understood. In place of\nmessy flesh, the clean execution of command and control, although as we shall\nsee there are code-based sciences where such a reduction is not easily made.\n\nCommodity fetishism occurs when relations between people take on the features\nof relations between things. The formula for the fetish Lukács offers is\ncaught in a prior distinction between object and subject, even if this\ndistinction appears in a more sophisticated form. Collective labor is what\nhides behind the commodity. But perhaps it is not so easy to separate labor\nand thing. So Haraway, like Bogdanov, wants to broaden the fetish concept a\nlittle. “Curiously, fetishes—themselves ‘substitutes’, that is, tropes of a\nspecial kind—produce a particular ‘mistake’; fetishes obscure the constitutive\ntropic nature of themselves and of worlds.”[60](part0015.html#ch3ft-60) A\nfetish is a naturalizing of the very thing whose “nature” needs calling into\nquestion, but while it may be limiting, it may nevertheless be peculiarly\nproductive: “There are amazingly creative aspects to commodity\nfetishism.”[61](part0015.html#ch3ft-61)\n\nGene technology is implicated in commodity fetishism, but maybe also in\n“another and obliquely related flavor of reification that transmutes material,\ncontingent, human and nonhuman liveliness into maps of life itself and then\nmistakes the map and its reified entities for the bumptious, nonliteral\nworld.”[62](part0015.html#ch3ft-62) Haraway’s détournement of the fetish\nrepurposes it. Rather than the _commodity_ fetish, she asks about the\n_corporeal_ fetish. How do bodies appear as autonomous things against a\nbackground of invisible non-bodies? In commodity fetishism, the apparent world\nof things, governed by the code of exchange value, obscures social relations\namong people and the production of use value. In corporeal fetishism, the\napparent world of bodies, governed by the code of the gene, obscures the\ntangle of both human and nonhuman processes that produce life.\n\nIn corporeal fetishism, the gene becomes a source of value as a kind of thing-\nitself, or perhaps code-itself. “So the fetishist sees the gene itself in all\nthe gels, blots, and printouts in the lab, and ‘forgets’ the natural-technical\nprocesses that produce the gene and genome as consensus objects in the real\nworld.”[63](part0015.html#ch3ft-63) An abstraction replaces the concrete; the\nmap becomes the territory. “Gene fetishists ‘forget’ that the gene and gene\nmaps are ways of enclosing the commons of the body—of corporealizing—in\nspecific ways, which, among other things, often put commodity fetishism into\nthe program of biology at the end of the Second\nMillennium.”[64](part0015.html#ch3ft-64)\n\nJust as the commodity fetish makes all things property to be exchanged, so too\nthe corporeal fetish makes all of life a thing to be commodified through\nownership of its code. “Genomics ‘globalizes’ in specific ways. Species-being\nis materially and semiotically produced in gene-mapping practices, just as\nparticular kinds of space and humanity were the fruit of earlier material-\nsemiotic enclosures.”[65](part0015.html#ch3ft-65) Private property produces\nthe split between commodities and the labor that makes it; intellectual\nproperty produces the split between the gene and the organism that makes it.\n\nWhat was once biology’s commons of research materials becomes increasingly\ncommodified. Haraway takes the Human Genome Diversity Project as a case study\nin agency in the age of the gene. It was supposed to gather samples from\npopulations at risk of losing their more or less distinctive characteristics.\nIndigenous communities were not involved in formulating the project, which at\nbest sought their permission, not collaboration. Many indigenous peoples are\nstrongly against the results of such work leading to patents.\n\nThe “mutation” of the private property form into strictly controlled\n“intellectual property” makes whole new classes of things available for\ncommodification. “Like the stigmata of gender and race, which signify\nasymmetrical, regularly reproduced processes that give some human beings\nrights in other human beings that they do not have in themselves, the\ncopyright, patent and trademark are specific, asymmetrical, congealed\nprocesses—which must be constantly revivified in law and commerce as well as\nin science.”[66](part0015.html#ch3ft-66) Intellectual property grounds a new\nkind of class power.\n\nA patent defines what is nature and what is not. An artifact of “nature”\ncannot be patented. For that to happen, nature has to be mixed with labor.\nPatent is a site of struggle over what counts as subject and what as object.\nHaraway’s famous example is DuPont’s OncoMouse, the first patented mammal,\nspecifically engineered for the study of breast cancer. All sorts of organisms\nare now integrated into a strange techno-nature meant to support human life,\nor at least those parts of it that can be commodified. Not only mice but dogs\nand all sorts of other beings are our “companions” within techno-science. In\nplace of the liberal-humanist family, quite another kind: “the\ntechnoscientific family is a cyborg nuclear unit,” now that “life is a system\nto be managed.”[67](part0015.html#ch3ft-67)\n\nWhat kind of critical agency is possible in the world of OncoMouse? Do lab\nrats belong to the working class? Should battery hens be unionized? Should one\nhave the right to share in the surplus produced by one’s cells, even when\nthose cells are not in one’s body? Consider the case of Henrietta Lacks, an\nAfrican-American tobacco worker who died of cervical cancer. Cells taken from\nher body, without her knowledge or consent, were cultured and used in all\nkinds of research long after her death, from the polio vaccine to AIDS\ntreatments and gene mapping. Those cells proved not only useful for research\nbut profitable for medical business, while her descendants could not even\nafford health insurance.[68](part0015.html#ch3ft-68) How is one to think the\nmolecular agencies of such a story?\n\nFor Haraway this is a question of “how to queer the modest\nwitness.”[69](part0015.html#ch3ft-69) There is a certain historical structure\nof feeling that might characterize the ideal of the scientist: the modest\nwitness. Driving women out of forms of knowledge and power is not unconnected\nto the rise of science.[70](part0015.html#ch3ft-70) How could the “man of\nscience,” who refrains from public contests of valor and power, resist\nbecoming a feminized figure? By proposing a new structure of feeling: the\nnoble woman is modest of body; the good scientist will be modest of mind.\n\nHow can this figure be retrieved? Not by returning to a feminine modesty, but\nrather by imagining a feminist one. “My modest witness is about telling the\ntruth—giving reliable testimony—while eschewing the addictive narcotic of\ntranscendental foundations.” It is about reconnecting the making of\nobservations to the scene of their making. There’s a limit to how far an\nobservation can be abstracted from the situation that produces it. A thorough\nwitnessing sees also the means by which it sees what it sees, and knows what\nit knows. “The modest witness is the one who can be engaged in situated\nknowledges.”[71](part0015.html#ch3ft-71)\n\nPerhaps these gestures made to establish science as a whole way of life were\ntactical rather than essential. Perhaps there are other tactics by which the\nstruggle for objectivity can be waged by others, even by those whom this\nstructure of feeling once excluded. That might be exactly the reason to work\nin and against it: “The point is to make a difference in the world, to cast\nour lot for some ways of life and not others. To do that, one must be in the\naction, one must be finite and dirty, not transcendent and\nclean.”[72](part0015.html#ch3ft-72)\n\nThe figure which Haraway famously proposed as a point of view is the _cyborg_.\n“Like any important technology, a cyborg is simultaneously a myth and a tool\n…”[73](part0015.html#ch3ft-73) It is not the labor point of view, as if labor\nexisted independently of the apparatus with which it is entangled. It is not\nwomen’s point of view, as if one could speak of it as a universal subjective\nperspective, existing prior to the social and technical relations in which it\nmeshes. Cyborgs are affinities rather than identities, hybrids of human and\nother organics, information systems, ergonomic laboring, producing and\ndesiring. Cyborgs are monsters, or rather _demonstrations_ , in the double\nsense of to show and to warn, of possible worlds. “As monsters, can we\ndemonstrate another order of signification? Cyborgs for earthly\nsurvival!”[74](part0015.html#ch3ft-74)\n\nIn moving on from proletkult to “cyborgkult,” the point of view expands\nsomewhat from the makers to the makings of the molecular. In place of the\n“God-trick” of speaking as if one had access to a portal to the absolute, the\ncyborg is a kind of ironic myth, a heretical counter-story to the human as\npre-given. “Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still\ninsisting on the need for community.”[75](part0015.html#ch3ft-75) Like the\nMarxist-feminist critic inside the research university, the cyborg is always\nan insider and outsider to techno-science, which after all is pretty much the\ncase now for all of us. “I think the way I work is to take my own polluted\ninheritance—cyborg is one of them—and try to rework\nit.”[76](part0015.html#ch3ft-76)\n\nThe cyborg isn’t an innocent figure. “The main trouble with cyborgs, of\ncourse, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and\npatriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate\noffspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers,\nafter all, are inessential.”[77](part0015.html#ch3ft-77) Cyborgs are a kind of\norphan, in a more troubling sense in that parentage is not lost or forgotten\nbut never quite existed, even though “the cyborg … doesn’t have a mother, but\nit does have a matrix.”[78](part0015.html#ch3ft-78)\n\nThe cyborg is a contemporary kind of Platonovian conceptual persona, although\nit is not so much that which is _beneath_ the proletarian, as that which is\n_between_ the worker and her apparatus. Or rather, between three kinds of\nboundaries: between the organism and the machine, the animal and the human,\nthe physical and the nonphysical. Indeed, looking back now on Platonov’s\norphans, Chicklin and his shovel, or the terrifying hammerer-bear, many of\nthem are indeed already proto-cyborgs in the making, in the age of steam\nengines rather than difference engines.\n\nHaraway: “Too many people, forgetting the discipline of love and rage, have\nread the ‘Manifesto [for Cyborgs]’ as the ramblings of a blissed-out,\ntechnobunny, fembot.”[79](part0015.html#ch3ft-79) Surely this stems from the\npersistence of the ideological pull of the figure of nature, and an inability\nto think and feel through the emerging forces of production as anything other\nthan poisoned product of techno-science. Haraway:\n\n> From _One Dimensional Man_ (Marcuse 1964) … the analytic resources developed\n> by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and\n> recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance … But a\n> slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for\n> meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in\n> technologically mediated societies.[80](part0015.html#ch3ft-80)\n\nPerhaps it would be possible to sense a web of human and nonhuman agents, more\na mechanically and digitally reproducible compound eye than a single labor\npoint of view.\n\nPerhaps this point of view could be broader than that of labor, and not\nseparate, out in advance, production from reproduction. Perhaps it could also\ninclude something a bit distinct from either, a kind of activity that neither\nproduces nor reproduces, but proposes other means of doing either, or neither,\nor both. Could it even include the hacker class as a distinctive point of view\nnot entirely reducible to labor? One might start here with Bogdanov’s notion\nof organization, rather than production, as a “basic” level of analysis, but\nlook aslant at its unquestioned functionalism.\n\nThere is no real traction to be gained from trying to base a critique on\nnature versus culture, or the human versus the machine, nor is there leverage\nin play versus labor. In an era where there is money to be made from all sorts\nof effort people put in to voluntarily creating and sharing information, labor\nitself becomes an unstable category. Haraway: “We are living through a\nmovement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information\nsystem—from all work to all play, a deadly game.”[81](part0015.html#ch3ft-81)\n\nInformation is more than a powerful metaphor extended via substitution into an\nexplanatory causality for the world, or even for the cosmos. It becomes a\npowerful means of organizing worlds. Haraway: “Communications science and\nmodern biologies are constructed by a common move—the translation of the world\ninto a problem of coding, a search for a common language in which all\nresistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be\nsubmitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and\nexchange.”[82](part0015.html#ch3ft-82) It’s a matter of seeing this, as\nBogdanov would, as at once an actuality, as an ensemble of real phenomena, and\nyet also as historical, as the product of certain kinds of labor, or more\nspecifically of techno-science as a central way that power works in this stage\nof the commodity economy—whatever it might be.\n\nIt was prescient of Haraway to notice, and early on, that “the new\ncommunications technologies are fundamental to the eradication of ‘public\nlife’ for everyone.”[83](part0015.html#ch3ft-83) The reduction of a wide range\nof processes, and not just labor, to a thing, or in this case to code,\nsupports a vast extension of private property relations. Bogdanov was rare\namong Marxists of his time in thinking that commodification may have a long\ncourse to run before a transformation into other modes of production might be\npossible, but not even he imagined anything like this.\n\nThe monstrous omens Haraway detected in the late twentieth century came to\npass:\n\n> A major social and political danger is the formation of a strongly bimodal\n> social structure, with the masses of women and men of all ethnic groups, but\n> especially people of color, confined to a homework economy, illiteracy of\n> several varieties, and general redundancy and impotence, controlled by high-\n> tech repressive apparatuses ranging from entertainment to surveillance and\n> disappearance … The only way to characterize the informatics of domination\n> is as a massive intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment,\n> with common failure of subsistence networks for the most\n> vulnerable.[84](part0015.html#ch3ft-84)\n\nAnd so it came to pass, only it came to be called _precarity_.\n\nCreating any kind of knowledge and power in and against something as pervasive\nand effective as the world built by postwar techno-science is a difficult\ntask. It may seem easier simply to vacate the field, to try to turn back the\nclock, or appeal to something outside of it. But this would be to remain stuck\nin the stage of romantic refusal. Just as Marx fused the romantic fiction that\nanother world was possible with a resolve to understand from the inside the\npowers of capital itself, so too Haraway begins what can only be a\ncollaborative project for a new international[85](part0015.html#ch3ft-85)—one\nnot just of laboring men, but of all the stuttering cyborgs stuck in reified\nrelations not of their making.\n\nWhile Marx was rather diffident about the utopian side of socialist culture as\na counter to capitalism, these days it sometimes seems to be about all we\nhave. And so Haraway proposes as theorists for cyborgs some late twentieth-\ncentury analogs of Charles Fourier and Flora\nTristan.[86](part0015.html#ch3ft-86) If the critical cyborg is made in part\nfrom encounters with both science and feminism, its other liaison is literary:\nJoanna Russ, Samuel Delany, John Varley, James Tiptree Jr., Octavia Butler—to\nwhich list we shall shortly add Kim Stanley\nRobinson.[87](part0015.html#ch3ft-87) As Bogdanov and Platonov knew well, the\nalternative to trying to work the God-trick in our favor is some version of\nthat mythical Marx who loved us always and forever, in the form of queer\nencodings in the language of the times of what another time could be.\n\nGod is dead, and so too is the Goddess. The disenchanting corrosion of all\nthat is solid into the molecular abrades more than one way. If there is no\nthing-in-itself, no scientific-realist absolute, then there’s no prior and\noriginary subject for a social movement, either. We are always and already\ninsiders:\n\n> Feminisms and Marxisms have run aground on Western epistemological\n> imperatives to construct a revolutionary subject from the perspective of a\n> hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent position of moral superiority,\n> innocence, and greater closeness to nature. With no available original dream\n> of a common language or original symbiosis promising protection from hostile\n> “masculine” separation, but written into the play of a text that has no\n> finally privileged reading or salvation history, to recognize “oneself” as\n> fully implicated in the world, frees us of the need to root politics in\n> identification, vanguard parties, purity, and mothering. Stripped of\n> identity, the bastard race teaches about the power of the\n> margins.[88](part0015.html#ch3ft-88)\n\nThis is part of the terrifying force of Platonov’s insistence on the figure of\nthe orphan. There’s no mother nature, no father science, no way back (or\nforward) to integrity. To be orphaned is not to be alienated, in the sense of\nthe parting of a thing from a former “organic” whole. Tektology is all about\nconstructing temporary shelter in the world, but it is something that has to\nbe made, now and for a future, rather than an inheritance or entitlement to be\nretrieved.\n\nThere is work to be done, however, to bring Bogdanov and Platonov fully into\nthe present, as comrades on the cyborg reading list. What needs reworking is\nthe struggle of labor in and against nature. Haraway:\n\n> Humanistic Marxism was polluted at the source by its structuring ontological\n> theory of the domination of nature in the self-construction of man and by\n> its closely related impotence to historicize anything women did that didn’t\n> qualify for a wage. But Marxism was still a promising resource in the form\n> of epistemological feminist mental hygiene that sought our own doctrines of\n> objective vision. Marxist starting points offered tools to get to our\n> versions of standpoint theories, insistent embodiment, a rich tradition of\n> critiques of hegemony without disempowering positivisms and relativisms, and\n> nuanced theories of mediation.[89](part0015.html#ch3ft-89)\n\nThe cyborg point of view is shaped in part by social movements around labor,\nrace, gender, sexuality, and indigenous rights. The cyborg point of view is\nalso shaped in part by the sciences, by struggles to produce objective\nknowledge of the world, complete with substitutions transposed into it from\nthe dominant forms of organization. Part of the operation of a twenty-first-\ncentury tektology is to beam the former through the latter and vice versa, in\na speculative play and comradely labor of working toward a knowledge adequate\nto the tragedy of the totality from the bottom up.\n\nThe cyborg point of view has at least one other component: the point of view\nof the apparatus itself, of the electrons in our circuits, the pharmaceuticals\nin our bloodstreams, the machines that mesh with our flesh. The machinic\nenters the frame not as the good or the bad other, but as an intimate\nstranger. The apparatus, like sensation, is liminal and indeterminate—an in-\nbetween. It is an _inhuman_ thing, neither object nor subject. One of its\nspecial qualities as such may, however, be to generate data about a _nonhuman_\nworld. The apparatus renders _to_ the human a world that isn’t _for_ the\nhuman.[90](part0015.html#ch3ft-90) An apparatus is that which demonstrates\nsome aspect of a monstrous, alien world. An apparatus yield aspects,\nparticular monstrosities, which never add up to that consistent and absolute\nworld that remains the God, or Goddess, of all realists. An apparatus affords\nthe real, material and historical form of mediation.\n\nIf critical theory is to grasp what techno-science has made of us in the\ntwenty-first century, then at least a passing understanding of biological\nscience might be an asset, for this is an era in which life itself has been\ndisaggregated and brought under forms of molecular control. What makes that\ncontrol possible is a whole series of technologies based on sciences whose\nobject is not just on the molecular but even the sub-atomic level. Rather than\nassert a claim to contemplate these transformations as if from the outside,\nwhat might actually be more useful is a way of accounting from the inside for\nthe apparatus that produces us as cyborg beings in an Anthropocene time on a\nplanet experiencing vast metabolic rifts. With that aim in mind, I turn now to\nthe work of Karen Barad on the apparatus, and then using concepts extracted\nfrom that study, I move on to the work of Paul Edwards on the science of\nclimate change.\n\n[FROM BOGDANOV TO BARAD](part0005.html#sec-21)\n\nBogdanov wrote at a time when the science of physics was undergoing a profound\nrevolution. This was not the least reason he avoided any attempt to define\nnature by means of materialist philosophy alone. If such a theory of matter\nhas any content it will be rendered obsolete by further discoveries, and if it\ncannot be rendered obsolete then it is a metaphysical add-on that the practice\nof knowledge can do without. Better, he thought, to stay close to the\nmateriality of the process of the production of knowledge about “matter,”\nwhatever that might now mean. What “matter” might be changes, even the means\nof knowing what it might be changes, but what is constant is that matter is\nknown through the combined efforts of labor and apparatus. As the apparatus\nfor the production of such knowledge has extended on the one hand to the\nsubatomic scale and on the other to planetary and even cosmic scales, all\nkinds of new metaphors await for substitutional play, not to mention new kinds\nof causation.\n\nOf particular interest here is the work of Karen Barad. A colleague of\nHaraway’s at the University of California Santa Cruz, Barad has a PhD in\nphysics, and has worked as a physics professor, but her book _Meeting the\nUniverse Halfway_ is more an attempt to extract a feminist theory of\nscientific practice from particle physics. It could, as we shall see, actually\nbe a work of tektology. Barad and Bogdanov practice kinds of politics of\nknowledge that overlap. Their situations are very different. Regardless of its\nquality, Russian science of the early twentieth century did not come close to\nthe power and extent of the American science of today. A critical thought for\nthe times needs at least a passing acquaintance with the techno-science that\nmakes these times.\n\nBorn in the 1950s, Barad, like Haraway, grew up in the heyday of American\nscientific and technical leadership and power. In the physical sciences, that\nleadership really accelerated in the 1940s. The development of the atom bomb\nis the best known instance, but it is worth noting that during World War II\nthe United States committed even more resources to the development of\nradar.[91](part0015.html#ch3ft-91) That research built the theoretical\nfoundations and technical infrastructure for postwar electronics and\ncomputing, which in turn influenced many other fields of scientific research.\nIf one attempted to untangle the sticky ball of the postwar American military,\neconomic, and technical complex, then physics would be a consistent thread\nrunning through it.\n\nAmerican postwar techno-science grew so far and so fast it even drew women\ninto its operations to meet its “manpower” needs. Thousands of women trained\nin technical and scientific fields. If they succeeded in these fields it was\nagainst tremendous odds. Sharon Traweek, in her classic ethnography of\nparticle physics in the 1970s, refers to an image from a standard textbook of\nthe time, which illustrates for the aspiring physics undergrad what they are\nto look for and what they are to ignore as distractions. Among the things to\nignore is the body of a woman.[92](part0015.html#ch3ft-92) On this account,\nphysics as big science was a machine for producing, among other things,\ncertain kinds of white guys. Not surprisingly then, another strand one can\npick out of the sticky ball of postwar American power, a very tiny strand but\na strong one, is feminist science studies. The conditions were right for\nproducing a cadre who understood one or another science very well, but who\nalso understood only too well that they were enmeshed in a field of gender and\nother relations of power that called for systematic critique and action.\n\nI want to concentrate in this chapter on some interesting resonances Barad’s\nwork has with Bogdanov’s analogical thought. At first, this might seem like a\nstretch. Barad is leery of the legitimation of power and exploitation by\nreference to analogies from the natural world. And yet her writing makes\ntactical use of analogies, as we shall see—just different ones, even queer\nones. Interestingly, Barad tries to draw useful tropes and images directly out\nof the practices of scientific labor. Perhaps it’s a matter then of a kind of\ntektology, of a poetics of producing alternate analogies to the dominant ones,\nbut also a critique of the limits of analogical transposition.\n\nThis applies in particular to Barad’s “over-arching trope”— _diffraction_\n—that she borrows from Haraway.[93](part0015.html#ch3ft-93) Diffraction\npatterns occur in everyday life. The Marxist philosopher Henri Lefebvre tells\nthe story of swimming seaward one day and getting caught too far from the\nbeach when the weather turned. The imaginary order, his body’s power against\nthe world, is suddenly rent, and all is plunged into surviving the wavy real.\nAs he strokes shoreward, his strength waning, he finds a pattern in the chaos\nof the water, a rhythm and a form in the peaks and troughs of the waves. He is\nin a diffraction pattern, waves interweaving with waves, their forms passing\nthrough each other, as if occupying the same positions. Some peaks are\nspecially high, where two waves coincide; some are reduced, where a peak\ncoincides with a trough. As he swims Lefebvre finds the rhythm. Waves are not\nthings existing in a void; they are forms passing through\nfields.[94](part0015.html#ch3ft-94)\n\nDiffraction is also a key phenomenon in physics. For example, Lefebvre’s\ncontemporary, the Marxist scientist J. D. Bernal, kicked off his long career\nwith studies of the diffraction of X-rays passing through crystals to find\ntheir structure.[95](part0015.html#ch3ft-95) X-ray crystallography does not\nproduce images that reflect the form of the crystal. Rather, the X-rays pass\nthrough the crystal lattice, which blocks and bends their path toward an X-ray\nsensitive plate. Bernal had to measure and interpret the two-dimensional\ndiffraction pattern to find the three-dimensional structure of the crystal. As\na kind of evidence, a diffraction is more like an index than an icon, more a\ntrace of an event than a mimesis of a thing.[96](part0015.html#ch3ft-96) X-ray\ncrystallography, in this instance, is a record of an event that happened\nwithin its apparatus.\n\nDiffraction is not about how one thing is an imaginary reflection or double of\nanother. It does not take as given what is object and what is subject, or what\nis nature and what is culture. It is about their joint production. Diffraction\nis about how things pass through and produce differential patterns. Barad:\n“Diffraction attends to the relational nature of\ndifference.”[97](part0015.html#ch3ft-97) Barad goes on to claim for her own\napproach that “calling a method ‘diffractive’ in analogy with the physical\nphenomenon of diffraction does not imply that the method itself is\nanalogical.”[98](part0015.html#ch3ft-98)\n\nActually, it might, but there might be different ways to produce analogies.\nOne way is representationalist, which tries to get one domain to resemble\nanother via the analogy. Nature is like culture, or culture is like nature.\nDiffraction, on the other hand, is a non-representational analogy.\nDiffraction, at its best, does not look for the way science is just a mirror\nof culture, as the social constructivists might. Nor does it take science to\nbe a mirror of nature, as scientific realists might. Rather, it’s a question\nof taking apparently separate things, passing them through each other and\nseeing how they interact, how they might in part be mutually produced by each\nother, yet not alike.\n\nBarad aspires to “respectful engagements with different disciplinary\npractices.”[99](part0015.html#ch3ft-99) Her diffractive tektology passes an\nimage or figure from one domain of practice through the apparatus of another,\nnot to produce similarity, but to produce a pattern of refracted differences.\nIt is an experimental procedure for language, another orphan practice to put\nalongside Bogdanovite tektology, Platonovian détournement, Feyerabendian dada\nor Haraway’s irony.\n\nDiffraction is only partly about the passing of a form from one domain into\nanother. It is also about the testing of the pattern of that transposition.\nDescriptions of nature are always caught up in substitutions, but there might\nbe a way to work it so that assumptions from the dominant organizational forms\nare filtered out a bit, and some patterns from the labor of working in and\nagainst apparently natural materials come more to the fore. It’s a practice of\ndiffracting one body—or are they waves?—of knowledge through another.\n\nBarad: “ _interpretive_ questions about quantum theory plagued me as a\ngraduate student in theoretical particle\nphysics.”[100](part0015.html#ch3ft-100) Even in Bogdanov’s time, advances in\nphysics seemed to rule out certain kinds of metaphysics. For example, devotees\nof dialectical materialism applied interpretive contortions to bring it into\nline with both experimental results and theories in modern physics, but it was\njust one of a series of positions that physics called into question. Any kind\nof strong realism—which assumes that it can describe in advance the constants\nof a real world with which every genuine experimental result should be\nconsistent—was in trouble.\n\nWhat can one say of the real when different experiments produce reliable\nresults which are not consistent with the same metaphysics of what that real,\nindependent world actually is? For example: Is matter made of waves or\nparticles? It can’t exactly be both. Particles are localized in space and\ntime, whereas waves can extend. Waves can overlap, like the waves of water\nthat produced the polyrhythm of peaks and troughs through which Lefebvre swam\nto save his life. The problem for physics in the early twentieth century was\nthat there were reliable experimental results that showed _both_ wave and\nparticle behavior.\n\nOne solution to this sort of problem is Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty\nprinciple.[101](part0015.html#ch3ft-101) This in essence says that there is a\nlower limit to the certainty with which a behavior in an experiment can be\nobserved. The experiment will influence the observation. This saves the honor\nof realism at the expense of a closer examination of what actually transpires\nin experimental labor. A metaphysical real world is still assumed, entire and\ncomplete in all its primary qualities. It’s just that this noumenal world of\nthings-in-themselves is always just out of reach of the phenomenal world of\nexperimental confirmation.\n\nHere Barad prefers to follow Niels Bohr, who had a subtly different approach.\nHe notes more accurately that wave behavior and particle behavior are observed\nin different and particular—he would say complimentary—kinds of experiments\nusing different apparatuses, and mutually exclusive ones. Both are “real”\nphenomena—sensations in the Machian language—but each is the product of a\ndifferent apparatus. Bohr’s challenge is to Newtonian assumptions: that the\nworld is composed of objects with individual and determinate boundaries that\ncan be represented by abstract values independently of any particular\napparatus.\n\nAt first sight this would appear to wreak havoc with any notion of\n_objectivity_. Now, it needs to be said that objectivity is a category with a\nhistory.[102](part0015.html#ch3ft-102) There was a time when it meant\nsomething like the word of a gentleman as a modest witness. As science got\nbigger and the act of recording results became industrialized, what was\nobjective no longer took the discriminating powers of the gentleman to\nobserve, but was more a matter of a worker checking a dial and writing down\nthe number on the log sheet. Curiously, in both these versions of objectivity,\nthe labor of making something objective does not really figure. In the first\ncase, because gentlemen don’t work; in the second case, because while workers\nwork, that is all they do. The work is just there to prove or disprove what\nreally matters, which to a wide variety of theories of knowledge, including\neven some supposedly Marxist ones, would be the conceptual problematic of\nknowledge alone.\n\nWhether objectivity rests on a gentleman’s honor or a worker’s labor, in both\ncases it is supposed to be a mirror of nature. What makes a statement\nobjective is that it reflects nature without being unduly influenced by what\nis around it, either because of the moral probity of the gentleman scientist,\nor because of the rote work of the lab assistant. This is an image of\nobjectivity which derives, not so much from Newton’s actual practice, as what\nwas said about it after the fact. In Newtonian epistemology, the object and\nobserver are both physically separate and conceptually separate. What emerges\nis Newton’s strict causal determinism. Given the position and momentum of a\nparticle, its trajectory can be determined both in past and future time,\nirrespective of who or where the observer is.\n\nBohr does not abandon objectivity so much as pay closer attention to how it is\nproduced. Bohr’s objectivity is about being accountable to a materialization\nof which the scientific worker is a part. Objectivity means producing a\ncertain kind of _cut_ in the world, over and over again, and getting\ncomparable results. But the results are always the product of a particular\napparatus, which makes this cut in the world in a particular way. What is\nmeasured is not the world, it is rather the phenomena produced in this\nparticular apparatus. Actually, this approach is more, rather than less,\n“realist.” It’s a realism of the experimental medium itself.\n\nIf you want to measure the position of a particle, you need a fixed point of\nreference. If you want to measure the momentum of a particle, you need\nsomething movable, which can absorb that momentum and measure its force. These\nare different kinds of apparatus, one producing position-sensation, the other\nmomentum-sensation. They are determined by mutually exclusive apparatuses. We\ncan’t subtract the practice of measuring from the phenomena measured. But the\nlarger consequence is that there is no good way of discriminating between the\napparatus and its object. No inherent subject/object distinction exists. There\nis an object-apparatus-phenomena-observer _situation_. The experiment itself\nproduces the cuts which make these appear to be separate things.\n\nFor Heisenberg, _uncertainty_ was a problem of knowledge, an epistemological\nproblem. For Bohr, _indeterminacy_ is something a bit more. In a move from the\nMach field manual, he sheers off the assumption of a noumenal world. There is\nnothing behind or hidden, there is only the apparatus and the phenomena that\nhappens there. The crucial question is how the apparatus produces the\nparticular cut that makes a phenomena appear as an object for a subject. It is\nnot about uncertainty, but about what can be said to simultaneously exist. A\nparticular apparatus makes a particular cut, making particular sensations\nappear. These are not random or a mere whim. Empirio-critical thinkers,\nincluding Mach and Bogdanov, still imagined they could distinguish the\nobjective from subjective belief. The advance of Bohr and Barad is to insist\nthat what objectivity really comes down to is repeating the situation of the\nexperiment and communicating the result.\n\nOne can be a realist about the object of knowledge or about the process of\nknowledge, but it is very hard to be both at the same time. To be a realist\nabout the object of knowledge requires putting oneself in a quasi-Godlike\nposition, outside of the process. To be a realist about the process of\nknowledge requires bracketing off the idea of the noumenal object and engaging\nclosely with practices and their particular points of view. Mach, Bogdanov,\nBohr, and Barad, despite their many differences, can be read as this second\nkind of realist. They all break in one way or another with the image of\nknowledge as a representation of the world, with nature as an object of\ncontemplation. Theirs is a realism of the means of production of knowledge. It\nmight even be a realist _media theory_ , where the media in question are\nscientific ones.\n\nBarad’s version overlaps with some standard accounts, including that of\nFeyerabend, in seeing Bohr as this kind of\nrealist.[103](part0015.html#ch3ft-103) As Barad says, for Bohr:\n\n> there aren’t little things wandering aimlessly in the void that possess the\n> complete set of properties that Newtonian physics assumes (e.g. position and\n> momentum); rather, there is something fundamental about the nature of\n> measurement interactions such that, given a particular measuring apparatus,\n> certain properties _become determinate_ , while others are specifically\n> excluded. Which properties become determinate is not governed by the desires\n> or will of the experimenter but rather by the specificity of the\n> experimental apparatus.[104](part0015.html#ch3ft-104)\n\nThe key category Bohr advances, which is only implicit in Bogdanov, is\n_apparatus_. “As Bohr says, there is no inherently determinate Cartesian cut.\nThe boundary between the ‘object of observation’ and the ‘agencies of\nobservation’ is indeterminate in the absence of a specific physical\narrangement of the apparatus … The apparatus enacts a cut delineating the\nobject from the agencies of observation.”[105](part0015.html#ch3ft-105) This\nis an elegant solution to the problem of how the object of knowledge is\nsupposed to correlate with the subject of knowledge. In place of that binary,\nMach offered a monism based on sensation, Bogdanov on labor, and now Barad on\napparatus. Mach draws attention to the making of knowledge, Bogdanov to its\nrelations of production, and Barad to its forces of production.\n\nAny particular apparatus makes a particular cut. The real is not observation-\nindependent nature nor does it collapse back into the cultural. The real is a\nphenomena that the apparatus produces. An apparatus is not an idea; it is\ntechne, a media.\n\n> Apparatuses are not Kantian conceptual frameworks; they are physical\n> arrangements. And phenomena do not refer merely to perceptions of the human\n> mind; rather, phenomena are real physical entities or beings (although not\n> fixed or separately delineated things). Hence I would conclude that Bohr’s\n> framework is consistent with a particular notion of realism, which is not\n> parasitic on subject-object, culture-nature, and word-world\n> distinctions.[106](part0015.html#ch3ft-106)\n\nLike Bogdanov, Barad escapes the Kantian correlation, where objects may only\nappear to subjects. Here rather is a realism of the sensation and the work of\nthe apparatus that produces it. Only where Bogdanov stresses the work, Barad\nstresses its techniques. These we can think of as complimentary aspects of the\ntechno-science cyborg. And where Haraway stresses the connected and\nundecidable “nature” of the human and inhuman cyborg ensemble, Barad stresses\nthat aspect of the cyborg apparatus that makes the cut, producing the\nappearance of a subject distinct from its object.\n\nEven if one acknowledges that the apparatus produces the cut that makes the\nobserver-subject, it is tempting to put data on the side of the apparatus and\nthe concept on the side of the subject. But for Barad, no such neat assumption\ncan be made. “Apparatuses are the conditions of possibility for determinate\nboundaries and properties of objects and meanings of embodied concepts within\nthe phenomenon. Indeed, this embodiment of concepts as part of the apparatus\nis ultimately what secures the possibility of objective knowledge, as defined\nin terms of Bohr’s epistemic criteria of reproducibility and\ncommunicability.”[107](part0015.html#ch3ft-107) That the apparatus is a kind\nof media that can reproduce not just a result but also its concept is what\nmakes not just the data but also the concept part of objective knowledge.\n\nBarad: “Apparatuses produce differences that\nmatter.”[108](part0015.html#ch3ft-108) So far so good. But for Barad, Bohr\nreifies the apparatus, freezing it in space and time, as if it too did not\nhave a history, as if it was not the product of labor. He limits the apparatus\nto the laboratory. He cuts the apparatus itself off in advance. How is the cut\nthat makes the apparatus (which in turn makes other cuts) itself produced?\nBarad: “Apparatuses are neither neutral probes of the natural world nor social\nstructures that deterministically impose some particular\noutcome.”[109](part0015.html#ch3ft-109) The apparatus has its own history. It\nis part of a larger mode of production and organization, but it does not\nnecessarily reflect it. Rather, Barad steers our attention to how the specific\napparatus might rather refract the larger world of productive forces and\nrelations.\n\nThe apparatus is the condition of possibility of the meaning of concepts as\nwell as of measurements of phenomena. Knowing, measuring, theorizing, and\nobserving are all material practices of interacting with a part of the world.\nBohr and Barad dispense with Heisenberg’s metaphysical postulate of a noumenal\nworld of objects with properties and parallel concepts with meanings, as if\nthese could exist without an apparatus and without labor. Thinking,\nexperimenting, and labor are engagements with a world of which they are just\nparts.\n\nThe challenge is to abandon a realism of the object of knowledge, the idea of\nthe real as a separate world, while holding on to a realism of the process,\nthe sensation, or the phenomena, that the apparatus produces. “The phenomena\nthat are produced are not the consequences of human will or intentionality or\nthe effects of the operations of Culture, Language, or\nPower.”[110](part0015.html#ch3ft-110) Phenomena are real, but their specific\nreality does not warrant too firm an assertion of a reality in general of\nwhich they would then be representative examples.\n\nHere Barad has something to offer beyond Bogdanov. Her primary metaphor of\nrefraction steers away from the analogical excesses of tektology, drawing\nattention to the apparatus that makes a refractive field of differences rather\nthan a reflective doubling of labor into a picture of the world. Analogy has\nits place in Barad, but her thinking is more metonymic than metaphoric, in\nthat it is more interested in the apparatus as that which produces a part of\nthe real than in labor as a metaphor for the production of the real as a\nwhole, as is sometimes to be found in Bogdanov.\n\nThings don’t necessarily exist as separate or separable prior to the cut made\nin the world by the apparatus, which yields the phenomenon of something\nseparate and knowable as an object of knowledge to a subject. It is the\napparatus that produces the phenomena, here of waves, there of particles.\nThere is thus a bit less one can claim about the causal order of the real. The\ndeterministic universe, separate from the observer and relentless in its\ncause-effect sequences, can’t be said to be there.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to ask: What counts as _agency_? What\ncan be said to act? Agency is not something that humans or even nonhumans\n“have.” It is not something that some possess and some do not. It’s an effect\nof a situation, often a situation that includes an apparatus. For an agent to\nappear, there’s a prior cut. The agent appears separate as an effect of a kind\nof “exteriority-within-phenomena.”[111](part0015.html#ch3ft-111)\n\nBarad abandons an approach in which agents interact, as if the agents always\nexisted before the actions. She speaks instead of _intra-actions_. “Intra-\nactions always entail particular exclusions, and exclusions foreclose the\npossibility of determinism, providing the condition of an open future. But\nneither is anything and everything possible at any given moment. Indeed,\nintra-actions iteratively reconfigure what is possible and what is\nimpossible—possibilities do not sit still.”[112](part0015.html#ch3ft-112)\nAgency is, then:\n\n> a matter of intra-acting; it is an enactment, not something that someone or\n> something has. It cannot be designated as an attribute of subjects or\n> objects (as they do not pre-exist as such). It is not an attribute\n> whatsoever. Agency is “doing” or “being” in its intra-activity. It is the\n> enactment of iterative changes to particular practices—iterative\n> reconfigurations of topological manifolds of spacetimematter\n> relations.[113](part0015.html#ch3ft-113)\n\nSuch might be the beginnings of a basic metaphor for comradely cyborg labors\nfor our time.\n\nThe objectivity of the labors of producing knowledge is not waved away on this\naccount. Rather, the work of constructing a particular determinate cut within\na particular apparatus, but in such a way as to be repeatable and\ncommunicable, is the basis, the infrastructure, for a certain kind of\nknowledge, a science. “The condition of possibility for objectivity is\ntherefore not absolute exteriority but agential separability—exteriority\nwithin phenomena.”[114](part0015.html#ch3ft-114) Strangely enough, “intra-\nactions enact agential separability—the condition of exteriority-within-\nphenomena.”[115](part0015.html#ch3ft-115) There is no a priori object, or\nsubject, or correlation between them. “Knowing is not about seeing from above\nor outside or even seeing from a prosthetically enhanced human body. Knowing\nis a matter of intra-acting.”[116](part0015.html#ch3ft-116)\n\nAs in _Hamlet_ , where a king can go through the guts of a worm; as in\nPlatonov, where peasants, burdocks, water, and steam engines are comrades, so\ntoo in Barad: the category of possible agent does not decide in advance what\nis an active and what is a passive partner. Barad calls this an _agential\nrealism_ , but one might also say a queer realism. And as in any attempt to\nwrite about the materiality of process, the effort puts some pressure on the\nmaterial of writing itself, on language, leading to sentences such as: “Intra-\nactions are non-arbitrary, nondeterministic causal enactments through which\nmatter-in-the-process-of-becoming is iteratively enfolded into its ongoing\ndifferential materialization.”[117](part0015.html#ch3ft-117)\n\nThe apparatus has entered critical theory mostly as a way of accounting for\nthe production of bodies. From Michel Foucault to Judith Butler, there’s a\nline of thought whose substitutions are architectural, and which pay close\nattention to the building of worlds that productively shape bodies, which in\nturn generate resistance against that shaping, and sometimes come to perform\nthemselves even against that shaping apparatus. This framing of the subject\nvia the meat-space of its making can go further, however.\n\nBarad: “Theories that focus exclusively on the materialization of human bodies\nmiss the crucial point that the very practices by which the differential\nboundaries of the human and the nonhuman are drawn are always already\nimplicated in particular materializations.”[118](part0015.html#ch3ft-118)\nThere’s a fetishistic quality, then, to such procedures, which show in detail\nthe moments of the human emerging out of the mesh of power apparatuses, but\npay less attention to the reciprocal creation of those very apparatuses as\napparently inert and resistible things.\n\nButler and Foucault might point toward a sort of post-humanities, but one\nstill a bit too tied to the point at which the human appears out of the\napparatus.[119](part0015.html#ch3ft-119) However, “apparatuses are not merely\nabout us.”[120](part0015.html#ch3ft-120) Barad’s writing might point instead\nto a kind of critical rewriting of what might instead be thought of as the\n_inhumanities_. The _inhuman_ would here be the apparatus, the cuts it makes,\nthe phenomena it records and communicates, that produce sensations from a\n_nonhuman_ world. The inhuman mediates the nonhuman to the human. This\npreserves the queer, _alien_ quality of what can be produced by an\napparatus—particle physics for example—without saying too much about the\nnonhuman in advance.\n\nMarx grasped the inhuman quality of machine production as the pushing to the\nperiphery of the human worker’s labor. The machine came to have its means of\nboth power and control, and the worker becomes a monitor of these systems.\nWhat Marx did not anticipate was the pushing of the human to the periphery of\nnot just the industrial apparatus but the scientific one as well. In the late\nMarx at least, species-being is entirely enmeshed in the processes that\nproduce it rather than being a pre-given essence. But the human is orphaned\nnot just from laboring but from knowing. Thinking this process cannot stop\nwith the peripheral production of the laboring or knowing body, but has to\npress further into the techno-science that produces many such cuts, between\nobjects and other objects, just as much as between the object and subject,\neven when thought in the more sophisticated form of the cut between apparatus\nand body in Foucault and Butler.\n\nIn the early twenty-first century certain philosophies became popular which\ndispensed with the subject of knowledge as the necessary correlate of the\nobject and opened up a speculative relation to it rather than a critical one.\nHaving grown bored with the subject being all and the object nothing, now the\nobject is all and the subject nothing. But this is just a reversal of a\ncertain kind of fetishism, in which the whole of collective labor and\napparatus which produces the cut between object and subject is elided and a\npurely contemplative realism asserted in its place. To the contrary, our\njourney through Marx, Mach, Bogdanov, Platonov, Feyerabend, Haraway, and Barad\nis among other things one that restores to the center of attention the realism\nof labor, practice, apparatus, and as we shall see even in science—\n_infrastructure_.\n\nThe subject of knowledge is as much a production of the apparatus as the\nobject with which it apparently correlates. But this is neither a dogmatic nor\na speculative realism, both of which concern themselves with an object of\nknowledge that is metaphysical in nature. Such realisms are not comradely, as\neach insists on philosophy’s unique power to legislate at the portals of the\nabsolute. What appears most likely to be productive of new knowledge is a\nphenomenal or agental realism that inquires closely into the means of its own\nproduction.\n\nBoth Marx and Platonov have moments of a kind of schizophrenic vision, where\nsubjects and objects appear to dissolve completely into their constituent\nprocesses, not just of production and reproduction but also of disruption and\ndisorder. In Marx it’s the metabolic rift he glimpses in volume three of\n_Capital_ , of the molecular out of joint. In Platonov it is Dvanov’s\ndelirious merging with the objects of everyday life. It’s the vision Bogdanov\ntries to temporally stabilize and orient from the labor point of view.\n\nIn Barad, we likewise glimpse the queer world of particle physics, that\ninhuman view of a nonhuman world that is so far below the threshold of human\nperception that we struggle for language to describe\nit.[121](part0015.html#ch3ft-121) Barad nevertheless offers certain concepts\nthat help push the game of substitution in a new direction, and that might\nhelp in particular with Marx’s vision of the metabolic rift. The apparatus and\nits cuts, and the intra-actions that the apparatus both effects and\nstabilizes, might help us with thinking what might be the central discipline\nof the inhumanities: climate science, to which we turn next.\n\nWe started [Part II](part0011.html) of _Molecular Red_ with Feyerabend’s\nreading of Mach, which would have us stay close to the realism of sensations,\nbut is not entirely without its playful and creative use of substitution. Then\nHaraway helped us put that in the context of thinking our cyborgian point of\nview, in which we are at one and the same time a product of techno-science and\nyet inclined to think ourselves separate from it. There we learned not to make\na fetish of either the thing or the body but to inquire as to the molecular\nrelations in which such nodes emerge. Barad then extends the cyborg’s agency\ndeep into the inquiry as to the physical composition of things. It’s time then\nto jump to a much larger scale—a planetary scale—and examine not just the\napparatus but the whole infrastructure of apparatuses via which we come to\nknow our climate as potentially unstable and as destabilized by metabolic\nrifts opened up by the collective laboring cyborg that is our species-being,\nitself shaped by the commodity form and techno-science.\n\n[CLIMATE SCIENCE AS TEKTOLOGY](part0005.html#sec-22)\n\nPlatonov worked on four kinds of infrastructure: the railways, electricity,\nirrigation, and the rather more subtle but pervasive one of standards, when he\nworked on weights and measures. He gives a vivid description of the struggle\nto build up infrastructure in “The Motherland of Electricity.” Set in 1921,\nhis story tells of a young engineer, “haunted by the task of the struggle\nagainst ruin,” who is summoned to a remote village by a rather poetic\ncommuniqué from the secretary of the village\nsoviet.[122](part0015.html#ch3ft-122) The land is parched, the peasants are\nstarving. So the engineer concocts a scheme to build some infrastructure to\nhelp them.\n\nThere are few resources: searching through the loot expropriated from the\nlandlord, the poet secretary and his new comrade the engineer find some\nPicasso paintings, but no pumps. There are irrigation channels but no way to\nmove the water. The young engineer persuades an old peasant to give up the\nalcohol he makes in his still. The alcohol will run the one engine in the\nvillage, an old motorcycle. The engineer then persuades the local mechanic to\ntake some scrap metal and make a paddlewheel. This replaces the back wheel of\nthe bike, and now pumps water through the old irrigation channels.\n\nThe engineer succeeds—at least for a moment—in building an infrastructure out\nof available parts in which the technologies—such as they are—interlock. In\nthis case the social practices that might go with this system don’t quite\ntake. The still explodes, killing the old peasant. He was using his own\nstomach as the apparatus to test the proof of the liquor, and fell asleep on\nthe job.\n\nOften in Platonov the infrastructure fails to live up to the superstructure of\nthe revolution. Nevertheless, he thought a key piece of it should be a\n_knowledge infrastructure_. In his plan for a literary factory, he imagined a\ndistributed network of specialized text-filtering centers with central nodes\nfor the final synthesis of literary works. This, like Bogdanov’s Socialist\nAcademy, did not come to pass. The knowledge infrastructures that did get\nbuilt around the planetary west, such as California’s great research\nuniversities, intimately intra-act with commodification, military strategy,\nand digital technology.[123](part0015.html#ch3ft-123) This aggregate\napparatus, all these cyborg knowings and inhuman doings, have the queer\nquality of both reproducing the world as commodity and strategy, and yet also\nof generating intimations of a nonhuman world.\n\nA quite surprising knowledge infrastructure that did get built is the one\nthrough which scientists came to know about climate. What distinguishes\nclimate science from particle physics or even genetics is that the data has to\ncome from the whole of the big, bad, outside world. In climate science, it is\nnot possible to build an apparatus that makes a cut, separating and\ndelineating the object of study in its totality. Atmosphere is all around. You\nare sucking it in right now. The study of climate called into being a whole\ninfrastructure of discrete apparatuses, of distinctive cuts. Climate science\nthus poses some fairly novel problems as to what a science is or should be,\nand not least what a comradely, cooperative science could be.\n\nOur guide to climate science is _A Vast Machine_ , by Paul Edwards, who was a\ngraduate student with Haraway before becoming a noted historian of science. _A\nVast Machine_ takes its title from a remark by John Ruskin, who in 1839\nimagined a panoptic system for knowing simultaneously the state of the weather\non the entire surface of the planet.[124](part0015.html#ch3ft-124) Ruskin\nprefigures in some respects what actually came to pass—the building up, bit by\nbit, often from existing parts, first of partial systems, then a network, and\nby the twenty-first century an entire infrastructure for gathering weather\ndata.\n\nIn some other respects, perfect weather surveillance turned out to be as\nimpossible as the perfect surveillance of elementary particles. What Edwards\ncalls _friction_ , for which Bogdanov’s term _resistance_ could well\nsubstitute, stands in the way of a perfect knowledge of real weather. There is\ndata resistance, which impedes the gathering of weather data readings. There\nis metadata resistance, which is a limit to what is known about the\ncircumstances relevant to particular weather readings. There is computational\nresistance, which limits the accuracy of the calculation of future weather\nstates from weather data. Edwards also gives many examples of kinds of\ncultural and political, or in Bogdanov’s terms organizational, resistance that\nhad to be overcome to produce a global knowledge of global climate.\n\nEven with the advanced technology of the twenty-first century, human\nmeteorologists are not entirely obsolete as components in weather forecasting\ncyborgs. Interpreting the data sometimes needs a little human experience.\nPredicting future weather is hard. Predicting _past_ weather isn’t much\neasier. Climate is the history of weather. The resistances which make\npredicting weather hard make the rather different science of understanding\nclimate even harder. Weather is a complex system. Small variations can have\nrather large consequences. Even when the resistance that results from\ngathering data, knowing about the gathering of the data, and processing the\ndata is small, that small variation can produce rather significant differences\nin the prediction of both past and future climate, even in today’s advanced\nclimate modeling computation systems.\n\nDespite the differences in the results that climate modeling scientists get\nfrom their efforts, there is an overwhelming consensus around certain\npropositions that could at this point be called facts. Average temperatures\naround the world are rising. One of the causes of that trend is increases in\nthe levels of atmospheric carbon. The cause of that increase is collective\nhuman labor.[125](part0015.html#ch3ft-125) In short, climate science holds\nthat what I am calling the Carbon Liberation Front is real. As in any\nestablished science, there is plenty of controversy, but debates occur within\nthis consensus.\n\nThe scientific recognition that collective human labor is causing climate\nchange could well be one of those great discontinuities in perspective such as\nthe heliocentric universe of Copernicus and Galileo, the evolution of species\nin Darwin and Wallace, and what Althusser rather problematically calls Marx’s\nopening up of the “continent of history.”[126](part0015.html#ch3ft-126) In the\nAnthropocene, some neutral, pre-given planetary nature is no longer available\nas a fiction of the real. We fucked it up.\n\nLabor in and against nature is an intra-action which produces a second nature,\na constructed, material world, the ant-heap of so-called civilization. Perhaps\nit even produces a third nature, a networked, communicative world, a digital\npheromone trail of signals, signs, and symbols, a global interactive\nspectacle.[127](part0015.html#ch3ft-127) Nature always appears in the rear-\nview mirror, as a reflection of that which recedes from this juggernaut of an\nSUV in which we rattle on into the future. Or perhaps nature is just the movie\nthat’s playing on the screen now embedded in the dashboard, while the SUV\nidles in a ditch, no longer going anywhere, just waiting for the wave of\ntravail it left behind to catch up with it. Here comes the Carbon Liberation\nFront, and the slo-mo replay of the molecular products of metabolic rift\ncatching up with the vehicle which tore across the world, excreting\nit.[128](part0015.html#ch3ft-128)\n\nEdwards doesn’t spend much time on the concept of the Anthropocene as\ndiscontinuity, but it would surely have interested Bogdanov. It is an\nhistorical moment when one true worldview is superseded by one of greater\ngenerality. Mother Nature as passive resister to he who acts no longer holds\nas a basic metaphor. Resistance has to be rethought a bit, perhaps along the\nlines of Platonov, as a labor that presses on an earth pressing back. But\ncertainly there can be no resort to the figures of Gaia any more than to\nPrometheus.[129](part0015.html#ch3ft-129) The Gods cannot save us; the Goddess\ncannot save us. As Haraway insists, the engendering habits of thought about\nnature have to become an object of critique as a whole, rather than merely\nreversing the poles and celebrating a divine feminine nature. Our cyborgian\nselves are at last forced to face, with sober senses, our un-kind relations\nwith the real.\n\nHaving something to say about climate science is surely a central test for any\nviable critical theory in the Anthropocene. Climate science understands the\nplanet as a system with a history. It is the coming together of three separate\nkinds of knowledge: weather forecasting, the empirical study of climate, and\ntheoretical meteorology. Bringing those three fields together required the\ngrowth of an extensive infrastructure of observation, communication,\nprocessing, and modeling. This infrastructure is a vastly more elaborate form\nof exactly the same sort of thing Platonov was working on in the countryside.\nIt is embedded, extensive, standardized, modular, and—as he knew all too\nwell—visible when it fails.\n\nInfrastructure connects diverse structures, such as the liquor still, the\nmotor bike, and the irrigation ditch. Science, like irrigation, requires an\ninfrastructure, and any Marxist theory of knowledge rightly begins with some\nstudy of that infrastructure. In _A Vast Machine_ , Edwards is not offering a\nMarxist theory of knowledge, although as a former grad student of Haraway’s,\nhe is attentive to both machines and metaphors. Edwards usefully provides the\ntools with which to start building one. Such a theory starts and ends not with\nmath or method but with the infrastructure by which a science is made.\n\nClimate science differs from bench science in the extent of its dependence on\ncooperative labor and communication for the production of data. Its history is\none of various bits of infrastructure slowly accreting and linking. Colonial\noccupations provided some of the first opportunities for recording data from\nvery different climates. The US Navy early on started keeping detailed\nmeteorology. The first theories of global atmospheric circulation arose in\npart out of the global vectors of trade and empire and the still-partial\nsensation of a global space they produced.\n\nThrough war and peace, the various sciences of weather and climate oscillated\nbetween forms of scientific nationalism and internationalism. Imperial power\nbrought with it attempts at universal standards, a universal time, Morse code,\nand the vector of telegraphic communication, which moves information faster\nthan weapons or commodities, although as yet not much faster than weather\nitself. Attempts at international cooperation on weather collapsed during both\nworld wars. Yet war made weather an even higher priority. Meteorology aids\naccurate ballistics, not to mention the timing of troop movements and air\nsorties. Just as the ship had once become a mobile weather station, so too did\naircraft, adding a third dimension to data-space.\n\nAs a field, climatology started off as descriptive and\nempirical.[130](part0015.html#ch3ft-130) The notion that clearing forests\ncould cause local changes in climate had already occurred to David Hume, and\nit would appear that early on Marx and Engels had grasped something of the\nsame perspective:\n\n> The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of\n> living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the\n> physical organization of these individuals and their consequent relation to\n> the rest of nature. Of course, we cannot here go either into the actual\n> physical nature of man, or into the natural conditions in which man finds\n> himself—geological, hydrographical, climatic and so on. The writing of\n> history must always set out from these natural bases and their modification\n> in the course of history through the action of\n> men.[131](part0015.html#ch3ft-131)\n\nBut it was Eduard Brückner who in the 1880s came up with some plausible ideas\nabout different causes of climate change. He thought German climate data\nshowed periodic fluctuations around a thirty-five-year cycle, and he linked\nincreasing desertification and drought to deforestation. Svante Arrhenius\nbrought concepts from physics into climate thinking. He calculated that\ndoubling atmospheric carbon dioxide would raise global temperatures by five or\nsix degrees Celsius, but he was more interested in explaining periods of\nglobal cooling.\n\nThomas Chamberlin started combining gas physics theories with geological data,\nand arrived at both a concept of the carbon cycle and of the role of life in\nthe carbon cycle. The idea that the carbon cycle was a driver of global\nclimate changes fell out of favor until the 1930s, as other research with\nother apparatus seemed to show that the water vapor in the atmosphere had a\nstronger greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide. Bogdanov’s interest in it in\nthe 1910s and 1920s appears idiosyncratic. The idea that held favor was one\nlinking climate change exclusively to variations in the earth’s orbit and\ntilt.\n\nThe carbon cycle climate theory was revived by the steam engineer G. S.\nCallendar, who also grasped the role of fossil fuel combustion in the carbon\ncycle. More sensitive instruments now showed carbon absorbing heat in a wider\nspectrum than water vapor. Callendar calculated that temperatures were already\nrising. The Royal Society was unimpressed, and rightly so, given the poor\nstate of theoretical climate science and unreliability of the data at the\ntime.\n\nA major advance on the theoretical side came when Vilhelm Bjerknes applied\nconcepts from fluid dynamics and modeled weather with a system of seven\nequations. Here we have one of those non-metaphoric substitutions, more of the\nHaraway than the Bogdanov kind, where a logical and formal technique from one\nfield becomes a diagram for another. There was a problem, however. There was\nno way to gather the data or compute it, or efficiently make the computations.\n\nEdwards: “Data are things.”[132](part0015.html#ch3ft-132) If we are to avoid a\ncommodity or corporeal fetishism of such things, then critique has to inquire\nas to how data is produced. Data are the product of a whole series of labors,\nof observing, recording, collecting, transmitting, verifying, reconciling,\nstoring, cataloguing, and retrieving. In each of these processes, human labor\nand the apparatus intra-act in all sorts of ways. The most utopian thing in\nBogdanov’s _Red Star_ is that data and computation resistance have been\novercome, but the overcoming of these resistances is not part of the back-\nstory of _The Engineer Menni_. In climate science, we have just such a story\nof the labor of information, which overcomes resistances corresponding to\nneither Bogdanov’s mental nor manual resistances to organization.\n\nThe exigencies of war were a great fillip to overcoming such resistances, and\nit leaves its traces. The image of a storm “front” is a substitution that\nderives from military forecasting. Speed was the essence of weather\nforecasting, and so the forecasters did not want too much data. The overcoming\nof communication resistance had outstripped the speed of the processing of\ndata. The labor of processing data caught up with its transmission with the\npunch-card Holerith machines. In the United States, there was even a\ndepression-era WPA project to put all past ship weather data onto punch cards\nfor the study of climate.\n\nWorld War Two was the weather war. Even the Western Marxist philosopher Jean-\nPaul Sartre found himself, in his brief military career, drafted into\nlaunching weather balloons and recording wind velocity data for the\nartillery.[133](part0015.html#ch3ft-133) Military aircraft discovered the jet\nstreams, and, finally, theories about how upper level weather controls ground\nweather could be confirmed. Weather data captured from the Germans was treated\nas an intelligence find and several tons of records were carefully shipped\nback to the United States. It was an era when computing resistance was\nfalling, but data resistance was still high. Too much manual processing was\nstill involved. The human labor took the form of a series of analog-digital\nconversions: recording an observation from an instrument in a log book, then\ntranscribing those numbers for communication by telegraph, then writing them\nback into tables by hand, and so on.\n\nThe Normandy invasion confirmed the military value of forecasting. It was\nlaunched under cover of appalling weather conditions, based on a\nmeteorological prediction that the weather would clear once the Allied forces\nhad crossed the English Channel. It could be said that the weather was not a\nchance circumstance in this instance but had been fully _weaponized_. Postwar\nweather data infrastructure was a vast improvement on its prewar state, but as\nin Platonov, it had been cobbled together from different kinds of parts. For\nexample, teletype automated part of the data transmission, but shortwave and\nmicrowave transmission vectors were used in some situations as well.\n\nThe wartime development of computing made numerical weather prediction a\npossibility for the first time. John Von Neumann grasped how computers could\nbe used for weather data. Like the hydrogen bomb, weather is basically a\nmatter of fluid dynamics. Via a kind of tektological redeployment of the\nalgorithm, what worked in one field might work in another. Jule Charney used\nthe ENIAC computer for forecasting experiments, although it took more than\ntwenty-four hours to compile a twenty-four-hour weather forecast. This was the\nbeginning of a shift from analog to digital forecasting. As in other fields,\nearly results led to optimism about computing power, which took a long time to\npay off.\n\nWhat particularly appealed to military taskmasters was the prospect of\ncontrolling the weather. The Normandy invasion weaponized the weather that\njust happened to occur through accurate prediction. What would appear a next\nlogical step would be to command it. But before it could be controlled, it had\nto be measured and modeled. Not for the first or last time, a fairly remote\nmilitary objective fueled a whole range of research. The postwar period is one\nof the growth over time of model sophistication, model resolution, and\ncomputing speed, in part fueled by military funding and imperatives, but in\nthe process creating something else. Edwards: “In the 1960s and 1970s, this\ndata-driven, regionally oriented, descriptive field would be transformed into\na theory-driven, globally oriented discipline increasingly focused on\nforecasting the future.”[134](part0015.html#ch3ft-134)\n\nSomething quite strange happens when computing power reaches the point that it\ncan handle the complexity of a climate model: “If you can simulate the\nclimate, you can do experiments.”[135](part0015.html#ch3ft-135) The computer\nitself becomes the laboratory. And over time, more and more processes can be\nintegrated into the model, starting from a—relatively—simple thermodynamic\nengine which transports air from the equator to the poles, and eventually\nincluding a comprehensive model of how the atmosphere and the oceans process\nsolar energy, of the effects of clouds, ocean currents and turbulence, of the\nalbedo effect of different surfaces, and so on.\n\nClimate models become earth system models that include the entire carbon\ncycle. Such an apparatus still can’t predict the actual weather too far in\nadvance. Weather is complex, so predictive models aren’t accurate past a week\nor two. No model yet reproduces all features of recorded climate, but they do\nsimulate its general patterns. The computer becomes the apparatus for a kind\nof infinite forecast, predicting both past and future climates of simulated\nplanet Earths.\n\nWhat made all this possible was supercomputing infrastructure. “No fields\nother than nuclear weapons research and high-energy physics have ever demanded\nso much calculating capacity.”[136](part0015.html#ch3ft-136) Climate science\nis one of the few fields that has influenced the development path of\nsupercomputing. The first Cray supercomputer (model 1) shipped to a client was\na prototype that went to Los Alamos in 1977 for weapons work, but the next\n(model 3) was for climate research.\n\nIn this regime of code-causality, modeling problems remain. There is a trade-\noff between the resolution and the complexity of a climate model: should it\nhave more finely grained detail and only a few processes, or more processes\nbut less fine detail? Then there is the problem of rounding-off error. To how\nmany decimal points should a result be calculated? Tiny errors accumulate and\neffect the outcome. Even when starting with the same data, small differences\nin computer code can result in different simulation outcomes when modeling the\nsame climate on different machines. The simulated Earths of climate science\nall differ a bit from each other—although all of them heat up.\n\nMeanwhile, on the actual Earth, connecting up the weather data-gathering\npractices of the planet turns out to be an interesting precursor to the\ncreation of the internet. Overcoming geopolitical resistances to get\nagreements on standards, and getting them implemented, took patience and\npersistence. Cold War geopolitics and decolonization movements favored a kind\nof infrastructural globalism. The superpowers sought global information in all\nsorts of areas, of which weather was just one, and preferably from some direct\ntechnical means, rather than relayed via allies. Former colonies attempting to\nestablish themselves as sovereign states wanted to participate in global\ninformation sharing, but were not in a position to make major infrastructural\ncommitments. Global weather data came to rely on two standard kinds of Cold\nWar apparatus: the computer and the satellite.[137](part0015.html#ch3ft-137)\n\nThe Cold War saw an escalation of the “techno-politics of\naltitude.”[138](part0015.html#ch3ft-138) When the Soviets shot down Gary\nPowers’s U2 spy plane in 1960, the Americans claimed it was doing weather\nresearch, which may even have been slightly true. Climate science intersected\nwith the Cold War in one particularly eerie way: the “atmospheric” testing of\nnuclear weapons also turned out to be a nuclear testing of the atmosphere.\nTracking radioactive fallout was a boon to the development of three-\ndimensional models of global circulation patterns, and also to atmospheric\nchemistry.\n\nThe United States and the Soviet Union each launched their own weather\nsatellite systems, but superpower rivalry generated a subsidiary counter-\ndiscourse of peace, cooperation, and scientific progress. Weather was an area\nin which to realize all three. “The project enrolled scientists and weather\nforecasters in the competitive goals of the superpowers while simultaneously\nenrolling the superpowers … in scientific\ncooperation.”[139](part0015.html#ch3ft-139) The Soviet Union shared weather\ndata from the vast territory it controlled, although it withheld the locations\nof certain weather stations, which of course were likely military\ninstallations.\n\nWith some sort of infrastructure cobbled together, it was feasible by the late\n1970s to execute something called the Global Weather Experiment, which is\npossibly one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted, and the\nfirst to attempt to produce a fully global data set about planetary weather.\nIt also led to regular meetings of climate modelers from around the world.\nClimate emerges as a global object of a global knowledge practice, but\novercoming geopolitical resistances hardly resolves the other kinds of\nresistance.\n\nA key part of Edwards’s presentation of the genesis of climate science is his\ninsistence on what Barad might recognize as a kind of intra-action. The data\nand the models co-produce each other. It’s not that there is data and then a\nmodel of that data. At a certain point in its evolution, the model acquires\nthe capacity to create a certain quality of the data set itself. “Adding the\nthird dimension, computer model grids became an ideal Earth: the world in a\nmachine. Data from the real atmosphere had to first pass through this abstract\ngrid-space, which transformed them into new data calculated for the model’s\ndemands.”[140](part0015.html#ch3ft-140) Interpolation algorithms adjust data\nto what the model predicts it to read.\n\nTo test how a model fits the world, climate science does not compare model to\ndata, but model to another model, to a _model of the data_. “Simulating data\nto test simulation models; using one model’s output to measure another one’s\nquality: welcome to the mirror world of computational\nscience.”[141](part0015.html#ch3ft-141) The mutual adjustment of model grid-\npoints and observational records is a kind of data assimilation. Data and\nmodels intra-act. Sometimes models with simulated data predict better than\nones with actual observations. Such might be some of the peculiarities of\ntrying to produce knowledge in the era of code-causality.\n\nPart of the difficulty for climate science is that the difference between “raw\ndata” and analysis is much wider than in a lot of fields, due to the kind of\ndata gathered.[142](part0015.html#ch3ft-142) The apparatus is an inside-out\ncyborg, as it were. In a bench science, the apparatus effects a cut from the\nworld, producing a situation where an event can happen that can be contained\nand repeated. In climate science, there are thousands upon thousands of\ninstruments, each of which is an apparatus that makes a particular and local\ncut, measuring the value for temperature, or humidity, or barometric pressure.\nWhat is between and beyond these cuts remains indeterminate. The data have to\nbe gathered “in the wild,” and will always fall short of being perfect records\ndue to the instabilities inherent in the placing of the apparatus within the\nsituation it records, rather than having an apparatus produce the situation\nthen record it. The theory-laden nature of data is pushed to extremes in this\nscience.\n\nClimate science is not a _reductionist_ science; it is a _reproductionist_\nscience. “Reproductionism seeks to simulate a phenomenon, regardless of scale,\nusing whatever combination of theory, data, and ‘semi-empirical’ parameters\nmay be required. It’s a ‘whatever works’ approach\n…”[143](part0015.html#ch3ft-143) From a rationalist perspective, this looks\nlike Feyerabend’s “anything goes.” From a naive positivist perspective, it\nstarts to look like it’s “not science.” But it makes sense from the point of\nview Mach practiced, at least as Feyerabend understands it, which sticks close\nto the sensations that the apparatus produces, which toggles between data,\nmodel, and theory, and which uses conceptual, even critical tools to\nunderstand how each element in the practice of producing this knowledge, in\nand against the world, proceeds.\n\nModels emerge as a relatively new category of knowledge production, when the\nbasic metaphor becomes one of code-causality. Models are mediators between the\napparatus, the data, and the theory. They are a distinct kind of technology,\nembodied in code and the machines that run it. As Feyerabend might expect,\nthere’s no purity in either the data or the theory. The scientist’s chief job\nis trying to control for _artifacts_. How is the apparatus itself turning up\nas an artifact in the results as a kind of index of its own determinate form?\nAn unwanted refraction may show up in an image made with a compound lens as\nlens flare. Digital devices produce quite different and strange artifacts of\ntheir own.[144](part0015.html#ch3ft-144)\n\nThe vast panoptic machine Ruskin imagined did not come to pass, even in the\nera of big data. More data seems always to mean more data resistance. There\nare limits to observability. The apparatus produces the data it’s designed to\nproduce, and has value precisely in its determinate quality, in the cut that\nmakes it. Edwards: “You will never get perfect knowledge of initial\nconditions.”[145](part0015.html#ch3ft-145) Any particular model will always\ndiverge from observations, in part because of the determinate quality of those\nvery observations.\n\nThe problem with climate data is that most of it is actually weather data. It\nwas collected for the purposes of short-run prediction, not long-run modeling.\nThere is no consistent metadata attached to the data. There are not always\nrecords of what instruments were used, or if there were changes in the\nconditions of their use, nor are there always calibrations of a new instrument\nagainst the one it replaces. Perhaps the instrumentation was moved further up\nthe hill, or a gauge was replaced by one from another manufacturer. Artifacts\nin the data set can result from all sorts of such little changes.\n\nFor instance, there appears to be a sudden drop in sea temperature of .03\ndegrees in 1945, but it might be caused by a switch from data gathered by\nAmerican ships that measure engine intake water to British ones that drop a\nbucket over the side. Edwards: “Historically, climate scientists have often\nfound themselves stuck with damaged goods—leftovers from a much larger\nforecasting enterprise that ignored consistency and reliability in its\nconstant drive to move forward with newer, better\ntechnology.”[146](part0015.html#ch3ft-146) Ironically, this is a situation\nwhere the constant revolutionizing of the means of production introduces\nresistances of its own.\n\nThe methodological response in climate science is in a curious way an\nhistorical materialist one: “If you want global data, you have to make them.\nYou do that by inverting the infrastructure, recovering metadata, and using\nmodels and algorithms to blend and smooth out diverse, heterogeneous data that\nare unevenly distributed in space and time.”[147](part0015.html#ch3ft-147)\nInverting the infrastructure might be thought of as a way of working past a\nfetishism. The fetish is not so much of the commodity or the corporeal kind,\nbut a kind of _communicative fetishism_ , where what is communicated is\nsevered from how it is communicated. Climate science requires a theory and a\nmethod of studying the means of production of its own data—a media theory.\n\nThis makes climate science vulnerable to attack by those with an interest in\npreserving a carbon-fueled commodity economy, or those with an emotional\ninvestment in maintaining the everyday life it appears to sustain. Techniques\npioneered for the defense of tobacco, acid rain, and ozone depletion now\nappear in attacks on climate science. Edwards: “During the George W. Bush\nadministration (2001–2008), even as the scientific consensus grew even\nstronger, political appointees carried the manufacture of controversy to the\npoint of criminal corruption.”[148](part0015.html#ch3ft-148)\n\nCrucially, both the social constructivist and Heideggerian critiques of\nscience now shift in their effects to the right, by undermining confidence in\nthe methods of climate science and the consensus reached on climate change.\nHence the need for progressive forces to think tactically about where and when\nthe critique of science is prudent. Perhaps returning to something like the\nclassical Marxist and Bogdanovite open-mindedness toward the sciences might be\nappropriate, rather than the Heidegger-inflected critique of Marcuse and\nothers, which sees all science and technology as embedded in the same Western\nmetaphysics.\n\nHere we arrive at something of a crisis point for what one might call the\n_romantic left_.[149](part0015.html#ch3ft-149) This current wants a totalizing\ncritique of technology more than of capital, that would ground its rejection\nof techno-modernity on a claim to something prior to or outside of it: on\nbeing, on nature, on poetry, on the body, on the human, or on communism as\nevent or leap. But the problem is that the attendant closing of thought to\nscience and technology now plays into the hands of climate denial. That the\nCarbon Liberation Front is changing the climate is a knowledge that can only\nbe created via a techno-scientific apparatus so extensive that it is now an\nentire planetary infrastructure. To reject techno-science altogether is to\nreject the means of knowing about metabolic rift. We are cyborgs, making a\ncyborg planet with cyborg weather, a crazed, unstable disingression, whose\ninformation and energy systems are out of joint. It’s a de-natured nature\nwithout ecology.\n\nClimate science has no need for Marxist theory, but Marxist theory has need of\nclimate science. Its project has to move on, from the critique of political\neconomy to the critique of its Darwinian descendants in biology, to the\ncritique of climate science as a knowledge which shapes the most general\nworldview of the Anthropocene. It may sound like hubris to name an entire\nepoch the Anthropocene, as this seems at odds with the decentering and\ndemoting of the human that was a significant achievement of ecological\nthought. But the Anthropocene draws attention to androgenic climate change as\nan unintended consequence of collective human labor.\n\nThe Anthropocene calls attention not to the psychic unconscious or the\npolitical unconscious but to the _infrastructural unconscious_. What labor\nbuilds is a disingression. Moreover, viewed via the Anthropocene, human action\nremains quite modest and minor, it’s just that in fluid systems a small action\ncan have disproportionately large effects. Bogdanov had glimpsed something of\nthis in his law of the minimum.\n\nBogdanov is an unacknowledged precursor to today’s reproductionist sciences.\nWhile his grasp of the actual science, even for his own time, was limited and\nidiosyncratic, he understood that critique has to advance from political\neconomy to other sciences that shape the horizon of organizational\npossibilities. Rather than retreat to the high ground of philosophical method,\nhe plunged on into a practice of comradely sharing among different knowledge\npractices.\n\nFor Bogdanov, there is no Marxist philosophy as such, only the labor point of\nview. Philosophy was not to legislate on method for other kinds of knowledge,\nand in this Bogdanov is not of a piece with the grand search for a method that\nstretches through Western Marxism from Lukács and Korsch to Sartre and\nAlthusser. Those philosopher-kings imagined philosophy as the master\ndiscourse, which thought the _way_ the party ought to think, and hence _what_\nthe party ought to think. Bogdanov, by contrast, proposes a comradely\norganization of all kinds of knowledge and practice, not subordinated to a\ncenter or a theory. And hence Bogdanov belongs to a different practice of\nknowledge to those inheritors of Western Marxism like Slavoj Žižek or Alain\nBadiou, for whom philosophy is no longer a precursor to the thought of Lenin’s\nparty, but rather where Lenin’s party is a precursor to the thought of\nphilosophy.\n\nStill, as Bogdanov knew only too well, language always extends a little too\nfar. It extends its metaphorical chains to girdle whole worlds, real or\nimagined. As Haraway insists, there is a positive role in metaphorical\nextension, as it can open up lines along which new forms of experiment or\nlabor might develop. But as Barad would have it, such extensions need not be\nthought of in terms of resemblances. The refracting powers of language might\nhave their uses in producing language that can work between the sites of the\ndivision of labor. Taking Barad’s refractive studies of the apparatus and\napplying them to Edwards’s on climate science, we can see how a vast, inhuman\napparatus producing a quite nonhuman view of the world is paradoxically the\ncondition of possibility for thinking the problem of the metabolic rifts\nproduced by human-cyborgian labor.\n\nSo far I have made the case for a revised empirio-monism, to shear off the\nmetaphysical extrusions of a pre-Anthropocene era. I have made a case for a\nrevised tektology in which a humanist style of thought might collaborate with\nthe sciences without futile attempts to legislate for them, and yet without\naccepting a naive scientific realism either. I have advocated a more nuanced\nversion of the labor point of view, which understands labor’s imbrication in\nthe apparatus. What remains then of Bogdanov’s orphan legacy is to rethink\nwhat might become of proletkult. Here, rather than follow Platonov, I return\nto Bogdanov’s foray into utopian science fiction.\n\nOne version of what might constitute a popular, affective way of writing low\ntheory that is close to the experience of the technical and scientific labor\nof our times might be science fiction. There’s no finer exponent of it than\nKim Stanley Robinson, to whom we turn next. Robinson is very much a\nCalifornian writer, who grew up in the shadow of its booming aerospace\nindustries, but also had time for the Sierra Mountains nature writing of\nKenneth Rexroth. He is even, in part at least, a writer shaped by California\nMarxism. He studied at the University of California (San Diego) after Herbert\nMarcuse’s tumultuous time there, but was shaped by his influence, not to\nmention that of Fredric Jameson, under whose direction he went on to produce a\ndoctoral thesis on another great Californian writer, Philip K.\nDick.[150](part0015.html#ch3ft-150) Not of least interest in Robinson’s work\nis the way these influences are woven together into a forward-looking\nfictional world.\n\n\n## [4](part0005.html#ch4)\n\n## [Kim Stanley Robinson: The Necessity of Creation](part0005.html#ch4)\n\n> Alternative futures branch like dendrites away from the present moment,\n> shifting chaotically, shifting this way and that by attractors dimly\n> perceived. Probable outcomes emerge from those less likely.\n>\n> —Kim Stanley Robinson\n\n[RETURN TO _RED MARS_](part0005.html#sec-23)\n\n“Arkady Bogdanov was a portrait in red: hair, beard, skin”—and red politics,\nalthough it will turn out that there is another kind\nentirely.[1](part0015.html#ch4ft-1) He is a descendant of Alexander Bogdanov,\nand he is on his way to Mars, together with ninety-nine other scientists and\ntechnicians. Or one hundred others, it will turn out, when the stowaway\nsurfaces. This First Hundred (and one) are the collective protagonist of Kim\nStanley Robinson’s famous _Mars Trilogy: Red Mars, Green Mars_ and _Blue Mars_\n, published in the early 1990s.\n\nIf Bogdanov’s 1908 novel is a détournement of pop science fiction, then\nRobinson’s _Red Mars_ , is a détournement of the _robinsonade_ , a version of\nDefoe’s _Robinson Crusoe_ story. If we were to pick just one book as the\nprecursor to capitalist realism, _Crusoe_ might well be it. What makes it so\ncharacteristic of the genre is that it lacks any transcendent leap toward the\nheavens or the future. It is as horizontal as a pipeline. It is about making\nsomething of this world, not transcending it in favor of another. It makes\nadventure into the calculus of arbitrage, of the canny knack of buying cheap\nand selling dear.\n\nIn _Robinson Crusoe_ , the shipwrecked Robinson does not depend on God or\nFortune for help, he helps himself. He sets himself to work, as if he were\nboth boss and laborer. There’s no spontaneous bravery, no tests of honor, no\nlooking very far upwards or very far forwards. Robinson’s labors are nothing\nif not _efficient_. What is useful is beautiful on the island of capitalist\nrealist thought, and what is both beautiful and useful is without waste. There\nis no room for Platonov’s fallen leaf. The world is nothing but a set of\npotential tools and resources.\n\nDefoe organizes the bourgeois worldview with a forward-slanting grammar in\nwhich time is segmented and arranged serially. Robinson confronts this, does\nthat, attains this benefit. Here’s a characteristic sentence: “Having mastered\nthis difficulty, and employed a world of time about it, I bestirred myself to\nsee, if possible, how to supply two wants.” Moretti: “Past gerund; past tense;\ninfinitive: wonderful three part sequence.”[2](part0015.html#ch4ft-2) It’s the\n“grammar of growth.” Bourgeois prose is a rule-based but open-ended style.\n\nThis grammar creates a whole new visibility for _things_. In Defoe, things can\nbe useful in themselves. They are connectable only sideways, in networks of\nother things. With this you get that, with that you make this, and so on.\nThings are described in detail. Everything appears as a potential resource or\nobstacle to accumulation. What is lost is the totality. The world dissolves\ninto these particulars. The capitalist realist self sees a world of particular\nthings as if they were there to be the raw materials of the work of\naccumulation, for it knows no other kind of work.\n\nIn _Red Mars_ , Robinson bends the robinsonade to other purposes. There is\nneither heaven nor horizon, but the practical question of how various\nideologies overcome the friction of collaborative labor. It is not a story of\nan individual’s acquisition and conquest. It’s a story about collective\nlabors. The problem here is the invention of forms of organization and belief\nfor a post-bourgeois world. Robinson’s ambition is the invention of a grammar\nthat might come after that of capitalist realism.\n\nIn _Red Star_ , Bogdanov’s voyager to Mars is a single representative of the\nmost technically skilled and class-conscious workers, out to see the utopian\nsociety of labor as an already existing form. In _Red Mars_ , on the long and\ndangerous voyage from Earth to Mars, and in the early days of their arrival,\nthe First Hundred debate just exactly what it is they have been sent to\norganize on the “New World” of Mars. Several positions emerge, each an\nunstable mix of political, cultural, and technical predispositions. As in\nPlatonov, characters each bear out a certain concept of what praxis could be.\nOver the course of the three books, which are in effect one big novel, these\npositions will evolve, clash, collaborate, and out of their matrix form the\nstructure not just of a new polity but of a new economy, culture, and even\nnature.\n\nThe leaders of this joint Russian-American expedition are Maya Toitovna and\nFrank Chalmers, experienced space and science bureaucrats. Frank and Maya are\ndifferent kinds of leaders, one cynical the other more emotive. They quickly\nfind their authority doubled, and troubled, by more committed and charismatic\npotential leaders, Arkady Bogdanov and John Boone. Bogdanov and Boone _over-\nidentify_ with the political ideologies of their respective societies, Soviet\nand American, the Marxist and the liberal.[3](part0015.html#ch4ft-3) They\nactually believe! Chalmers and Toitovna find this especially dangerous to\ntheir more pragmatic authority.\n\nThese four could almost form a kind of “semiotic rectangle,” an analytic tool\nused by both Fredric Jameson and Donna Haraway.[4](part0015.html#ch4ft-4) It’s\ntempting to reach into the bag of tricks of formal textual analysis and run\nthe _Mars Trilogy_ through the mesh of such devices. The problem is that\nRobinson already includes such devices within the text itself. The character\nof Michel the psychiatrist is particularly fond of semiotic rectangles, for\nexample. The usual “innocence” of the text in relation to the formal critical\nmethod no longer applies here—Robinson did, after all, study with Fredric\nJameson. Perhaps that’s why Robinson always seems to want his stories to\nexceed the formal properties of such a schema. Rather, his characters form\nloose networks of alliance and opposition, always making boundaries and\nlinkages. The novel tracks one possible causal sequence in a space of\npossibilities. There’s no single underlying design.\n\nComplicating the four points of the semiotic rectangle of Maya and Frank,\nArkady and John, are three outlier figures: Hiroko Ai, who runs the farm team;\nthe geologist Ann Claybourne; and Saxifrage Russell, the physicist. Hiroko,\nAnn, and Sax are different versions of what scientific and technical knowledge\nmight do and be. Hiroko’s shades off into a frankly spiritual and cultish\nworship of living nature. Ann’s is a contemplative realism, almost selfless\nand devoted to knowledge for itself. Sax sees science not as an end in itself\nbut a means to an end—“terraforming” Mars.\n\nRobinson did not coin the term “terraforming,” but he surely gives it the\nrichest expression of any writer.[5](part0015.html#ch4ft-5) While there is\nplenty in the _Mars Trilogy_ on the technical issues in terraforming Mars,\nRobinson also uses it as a Brechtian estrangement device to open up a space\nfor thinking about the organization of the Earth.[6](part0015.html#ch4ft-6) On\nMars, questions of base and superstructure, nature and culture, economics and\npolitics, can never be treated in isolation, as all “levels” have to be\norganized together. Maya: “We exist for Earth as a model or experiment. A\nthought experiment for humanity to learn from.”[7](part0015.html#ch4ft-7)\nPerhaps Earth is now a Mars, estranged from its own ecology.\n\nOf the First Hundred, Arkady Bogdanov has the most clearly revolutionary\nagenda, and one straight out of proletkult. He objects to the design for their\nfirst base, Underhill, “with work space separated from living quarters, as if\nwork were not part of life. And the living quarters are taken up mostly with\nprivate rooms, with hierarchies expressed, in that leaders are assigned larger\nspaces … Our work will be more than making wages—it will be our art, our whole\nlife … We are _scientists_! It is our job to think things _new_ , to make them\nnew!”[8](part0015.html#ch4ft-8)\n\nThere are many actually existing, contemporary or historical societies that\nfor Robinson exude hints of utopian possibility: the Mondragon Co-ops,\nYugoslav self-management, Red Bologna, the Israeli kibbutz, Sufi nomads, Swiss\ncantons, Minoan or Hopi matriarchies, Keralan matrilineal land tenure. One of\nthe more surprising is the Antarctic science station. This he experienced\nfirst-hand in 1995 on the National Science Foundation’s Artists and Writer’s\nProgram.[9](part0015.html#ch4ft-9)\n\nRobinson imagines the first Mars station at Underhill as just like a\nscientific lab—and just as political. As Arkady would say, ignoring politics\nis like saying you don’t want to deal with complex systems. Arkady: “Some of\nus here can accept transforming the entire physical reality of this planet,\nwithout doing a single thing to change ourselves or the way we live … We must\nterraform not only Mars, but ourselves.”[10](part0015.html#ch4ft-10) Thus the\nmost advanced forms of organization can be a template for the totality.\n\nA field station like Underhill is not only an advanced social form, for Arkady\nit connects to a deep history:\n\n> This arrangement resembles the prehistoric way to live, and it therefore\n> feels right to us, because our brains recognize if from three million years\n> of practicing it. In essence our brains grew to their current configuration\n> in response to the realities of that life. So as a result people grow\n> powerfully attached to that kind of life, when they get a chance to live it.\n> It allows you to concentrate your attention on the _real work_ , which means\n> everything that is done to stay alive, or make things, or satisfy our\n> curiosity, or play. That is utopia … especially for primitives and\n> scientists, which is to say everybody. So a scientific research station is\n> actually a little model of prehistoric utopia, carved out of the\n> international money economy by clever primates who want to live\n> well.[11](part0015.html#ch4ft-11)\n\nNot everyone gets to live such a life, even at Underhill, and so the\nscientific life isn’t really a utopia. Scientists carve out refuges for\nthemselves from other forms of organization and power rather than work on\nexpanding them. The crux of the “Bogdanov” position in the _Mars Trilogy_ is\nmaking the near-utopian aspect of the most advanced forms of collaborative\nlabor a general condition.\n\nThis Arkady Bogdanov, not unlike the real Alexander Bogdanov a century before\nhim, is a kind of scapegoat to the revolution. Nearly all of the early leaders\nfall, in one way or another, and not least because they are too much the\nproducts of the old authoritarian organizational world. Mars has to transform\nits pioneers, or nurture new ones, on the way to another kind of life. A new\nstructure of feeling has to come into existence, not after but before the new\nworld. This is what Alexander Bogdanov thought was the mission of proletkult.\nOvercoming the logic of sacrifice is not the least of its\nagenda.[12](part0015.html#ch4ft-12)\n\nJohn Boone, meanwhile, finds many of Arkady’s ideas wrong, and even dangerous.\nJohn Boone is a charismatic, hard-partying Midwesterner. He is politically\ncautious, but acknowledges that “everything’s changing on a technical level\nand the social level might as well follow.”[13](part0015.html#ch4ft-13) His\nmission, at first, is to forget history and build a functioning society. But\nwhile dancing with the Sufis, he has his epiphany: “He stood, reeling; all of\na sudden he understood that one didn’t have to invent it all from scratch,\nthat it was a matter of making something new by synthesis of all that was good\nin what came before.”[14](part0015.html#ch4ft-14)\n\nBogdanovists are modernists who start over; Booneans are détourners of all of\nthe best in received cultures. Boone practices his own style of détournement,\ncopying and correcting, and tearing off enthusiastic speeches: “That’s our\ngift and a great gift it is, the reason we have to keep giving all our lives\nto keep the cycle going, it’s like in eco-economics where what you take from\nthe system has to be balanced or exceeded to create the anti-entropic surge\nwhich characterizes all creative life …”[15](part0015.html#ch4ft-15) The crowd\ncheers, even if nobody quite understands what Boone is talking about.\n\nSaxifrage Russell is a more phlegmatic kind of scientist, entranced by the\nthis-ness, the “haecceity,” of whatever he happens to be working\non.[16](part0015.html#ch4ft-16) For Sax, the whole planet is a lab, and when\nJohn Boone asks him, “who is paying for all this?” Sax answers: “The sun.” Sax\nquietly ignores the heavy involvement of metanational companies, for whom the\nwhole Mars mission is a colonization and resource extraction enterprise. When\nJohn later uses this same answer to Arkady, the latter won’t have it: “Wrong!\nIt’s not just the sun and some robots, it’s human time, a lot of it. And those\nhumans have to eat …”[17](part0015.html#ch4ft-17) Like Arkady, Sax sees\nscience as a component of a larger praxis of world building, but for Arkady\nthere’s still more. There’s the question of what kind of world and who it is\nfor—the question of the labor component of the cyborg apparatus.\n\nFor Sax, science is creation. “We are the consciousness of the universe, and\nour job is to spread it around, to go look at things, to live wherever we\ncan.” Ann the geologist disagrees. “You want to do that because you think you\ncan … It’s bad faith, and it’s not science … I think you value consciousness\ntoo high and rock too little … Being the consciousness of the universe does\nnot mean turning it into a mirror image of us. It means rather fitting into it\nas it is.”[18](part0015.html#ch4ft-18) But what does it mean, to “fit in,”\nwhen the fitting changes what it is in? Is it not metaphorically more like a\nrefraction?\n\nAnn’s is the most “flat” ontology of the First\nHundred.[19](part0015.html#ch4ft-19) Human subjectivity has no privilege in\nher world, and neither does life. The real for her is this: “The primal\nplanet, in all its sublime glory, red and rust, still as death; dead; altered\nthrough the years only by matter’s chemical permutations, the immense slow\nlife of geophysics. It was an old concept—abiologic life—but there it was, if\none cared to see it, a kind of living, out there spinning, moving through the\nstars that burned …”[20](part0015.html#ch4ft-20) If the basic metaphor for\nHiroko is that life is spirit, and for Sax that life is development, for Ann\nit is at best selection, the lifeless life of impacts and erosions of the\ngeological eons.\n\nLater, Robinson compares Ann’s relation to Mars to that of a caravan of\nitinerant Arab miners: “They were not so much students of the land as lovers\nof it; they wanted something from it. Ann, on the other hand, asked for\nnothing but questions to be asked. There were so many different kinds of\ndesire.”[21](part0015.html#ch4ft-21) For the miners, nature is that which\nlabor engages; for Ann, nature is that which appears to science only, shorn of\nany wider sense of praxis. Ann’s worldview is not so entirely selfless, with\nits “concentration on the abstract, denial of the body and therefore of all\nits pain.”[22](part0015.html#ch4ft-22) Nevertheless, it does speak to an\nabsolute nonhuman outside to knowledge, an outside that even Sax will\neventually have to acknowledge.\n\nWhile also technically trained, Hiroko is more of a mystic. She believes in\nwhat Hildegard of Bingen called _viriditas_ , or the greening power. This is\nthe key to her _aerophany_ , her landscape religion. Hiroko: “There’s a\nconstant pressure, pushing toward pattern. A tendency in matter to evolve into\never more complex forms. It’s a kind of pattern gravity, a holy greening power\nwe call viriditas, and it is the driving force of the cosmos\n…”[23](part0015.html#ch4ft-23) Arkady wants a kind of work beyond its\nalienation in wage labor; Hiroko wants work to be a kind of worship. As with\nAnn, Hiroko has a kind of ontology, but a vitalist and constructivist one,\noriented to a practice that transforms its object.[24](part0015.html#ch4ft-24)\nIn each case it’s a substitution which starts with a kind of labor and\nimagines a universe after its basic metaphor.\n\nThere’s a constant play in the _Mars Trilogy_ between what is visible and what\nis hidden. Hiroko hides Coyote, the stowaway, and herself goes into hiding,\nwith her followers, on Mars. She asks Michel the psychotherapist to go with\nthem when they leave the Underhill base and set up a secret sanctuary: “We\nknow you, we love you. We know we can use your help. We know you can use our\nhelp. We want to build just what you are yearning for, just what you have been\nmissing here. But all in new forms. For we can never go back. We must go\nforward. We must find our own way. We start tonight. We want you to come with\nus.” And Michel says, “I’ll come.”[25](part0015.html#ch4ft-25)\n\nWhen Hiroko, the Green Persephone, surfaces again, her actions require some\njustifying: “We didn’t mean to be selfish … We wanted to try it, to show by\nexperiment how we can live here. Someone has to show what you mean when you\ntalk about a different life … Someone has to live that\nlife.”[26](part0015.html#ch4ft-26) This is another tension in the _Mars\nTrilogy_ : between political struggle and the enactment of another life\ndirectly, in the everyday, as experiments in self-organization that create new\nstructures of feeling.\n\nIn the color scheme of the books, Hiroko stands for Green and Ann for Red. To\nestrange us a little from what we think these colors mean, the Greens are\nthose who favor one or another kind of terraforming, to artificially make a\nbiosphere for life. For the Greens, nature is synonymous with life. For the\nReds, nature is prior to life, greater than life. “Ann was in love with\ndeath.”[27](part0015.html#ch4ft-27) The Red Mars isn’t really a living one,\nand the Green one is more like a garden or a work of art—culture. Neither are\nan _ecology_ , if by that one means some ideal model of a homeostatic, self-\ncorrecting world. For the Greens, nature is that with which one works; for the\nReds, it is that which one contemplates.\n\nPart of the problem is working up an organizational language adequate to\ntechno-science, or as Boone says to Nadia Chernishevsky the engineer: “Muscle\nand brain have extended out through an armature of robotics that is so large\nand powerful that it’s difficult to conceptualize. Maybe impossible.” Life is\na tektological problem, lived against external constraints, but as Frank\ndespairs, “they lived like monkeys still, while their new God powers lay\naround them in the weeds.”[28](part0015.html#ch4ft-28)\n\nIt is like Platonov’s tragedy of nature and technology in a different mode.\nThe _potential_ of technical power far outstrips organizational forms or\nconcepts, which remain narrowly acquisitive and instrumental. They are on Mars\nto prepare the way for corporate resource extraction, after all. This is the\ndriving tension of the _Mars Trilogy_. All of the experiences of Mars, through\nstudy, work, or worship, are fragments of a new ingression, but they have to\nlink together, overcome their boundaries, and form a new boundary against the\nexploitative and militarized forms of life that sent them all there. But\ncrucially in Robinson, not only is a potential politics (Arkady and John)\ncounter-posed to an actual one (Frank and Maya), but a potential technics is\ncounter-posed to the actual one of the metanationals (with the Sax character\nmoving from the one to the other). The struggle for utopia is both technical\nand political, and so much else besides.\n\nThe first Martian revolution—there will be three—is in a sense against\n“feudalism,” against a residual part of the social formation based on self-\nreproducing hierarchies. It is a revolution against a world where the ruling\nclass, like the Khans of Kiva, is impoverished by its distance from any real\nwork—in this case an inter-planetary distance. It arises out of the conflict\nthat pits the First Hundred, leading the Martian working class, against the\nmetanational corporations and their private armies. As Frank Chalmers says:\n“Colonialism had never died … it just changed names and hired local\ncops.”[29](part0015.html#ch4ft-29) To the metanats, Mars has no independent\nexistence. To the Martians, it’s a place where the apparent naturalness of the\nold economic order is exposed as artifice, inequality, and fetishism.\n\nThe first revolution founders. Its vanguard is poorly coordinated, and relies\ntoo much on force, in a situation where the population in revolt is now\nheavily dependent on vulnerable infrastructure, which turns out to be\negressive and fragile. The metanats and their goons need only shut down life\nsupport to bring refractory populations to heel. Bogdanov’s law of the minimum\napplies here. The movement is forced underground. But perhaps this same\ntechno-science can also support autonomous spaces outside the metanat order,\nwhere new kinds of everyday life and economic relation might arise.\n\nThe first revolution is perhaps their 1905 Russian Revolution, although as\nFrank says, “Historical analogy is the last refuge of people who can’t grasp\nthe current situation.”[30](part0015.html#ch4ft-30) The first revolution\nresults in a treaty of sorts, negotiated by Frank, the cynical and pragmatic\npolitician. For Frank, “the weakness of businessmen was their belief that\nmoney was the point of the game.”[31](part0015.html#ch4ft-31) Sax at this\npoint still wants metanat investment, but Frank wants to contain it. As Frank\nsays to Sax: “You’re still trying to play at economics, but it isn’t like\nphysics, it’s like politics.”[32](part0015.html#ch4ft-32) Science and capital,\nit is clear to Frank but not yet to Sax, are not natural allies.\n\nIn defeat, Arkady and the Bogdanovists will hide in plain sight, to continue\nthe revolution of everyday life: “Why then we will make a human life, Frank.\nWe will work to support our needs, and do science, and perhaps terraform a bit\nmore. We will sing and dance, and walk around in the sun, and work like\nmaniacs for food and curiosity.” They will create the counter-spectacle of an\nunderground as a “totalizing fantasy,”[33](part0015.html#ch4ft-33) onto which\neveryone projects their wants. It is a matter of making extravagant proposals\nfor another life with enough serious seduction to draw bored and disaffected\nlabor into believing in it.[34](part0015.html#ch4ft-34)\n\nFailure to spark a global revolution on Mars prompts a kind of theoretical\nintrospection, not unlike the ones that happened after the failure of world\nproletarian revolution on early twentieth-century Earth, which resulted in the\ntheoretical reflections of Western Marxism.[35](part0015.html#ch4ft-35) It is\nneatly captured in a dialogue between Frank Chalmers and his assistant:\n\n> “How can people act against their own obvious material interests?” he\n> demanded of Slusinki over his wristpad. “It’s crazy! Marxists were\n> materialists, how did they explain it?”\n>\n> “Ideology, sir.”\n>\n> “But if the material world and our method of manipulating it determine\n> everything else, how can ideology happen? Where did they say it comes from?”\n>\n> “Some of them defined ideology as an imaginary relationship to a real\n> situation. They acknowledged that imagination was a powerful force in human\n> life.”\n>\n> “But then they weren’t materialists at all!” He swore with disgust. “No\n> wonder Marxism is dead.”\n>\n> “Well, sir, actually a lot of people on Mars call themselves\n> Marxists.”[36](part0015.html#ch4ft-36)\n\nMost Western Marxists thought ideology in its negative aspect, its\nmisrecognition; Bogdanov was more interested in its affirmative aspect, in the\nway an ideology overcomes resistance to a given form of social\nlabor.[37](part0015.html#ch4ft-37) From that point of view, what matters in\nthis exchange is the form of the dialogue between Frank and Slusinki—master\nand servant—rather than the content, a Marxisant critique of ideology. The\nMartians do not yet have a form of communication that expresses the\norganizational style of their emergent social formation. The problem is not\nwith the language or the theory, it’s with the forms of organization and\ncommunication. The failure of this revolution does not call for the Western\nMarxist turn to the superstructures, but rather a Bogdanovite turn to evolving\nnew forms of organization, including a new infrastructure.\n\nThe Martians are not ready for their revolution. Still, even an unsuccessful\nstruggle can create powerful structures of feeling, which may have future\nuses. “Arkady answered them all cheerfully. Again he felt that difference in\nthe air, the sense they were all in a new space together, everyone facing the\nsame problems, everyone equal, everyone (seeing a heating coil glowing under a\ncoffee pot) incandescent with the electricity of\nfreedom.”[38](part0015.html#ch4ft-38) As Platonov says, we are comrades when\nwe face the same dangers.\n\nThis moment of the fused group, united in action, might seed a memory for\nanother time.[39](part0015.html#ch4ft-39) These moments in the _Mars Trilogy_\nare rather like the civil war section of Platonov’s _Chevengur_ : the new\nspace and time, the new subjectivity it calls into being. But just as in\nPlatonov, the disorganizing power works faster and more conclusively than any\norganizing power. The emphasis in Robinson is not on the moment of revolution\nas universal leap toward the communist horizon, but on the accumulation of\nminor, even molecular, elements of a new way of life and their negotiations\nwith each other.\n\nCivil war destruction and sabotage transform the Martian landscape. The First\nHundred are on the run. Ann is distressed by the death of her dead world.\n“Here in the flesh she found it almost impossible to grasp. The landscape\nitself was now speaking a kind of glossolalia.”[40](part0015.html#ch4ft-40)\nThe civil war wrenches Ann from her strictly scientific relation to Mars. She\nbecomes a contemplative realist of a more metaphysical sort, her antennae\noriented to a great outdoors. “And it came to her that the pleasure and\nstability of dining rooms had always occurred against such a backdrop, against\nthe catastrophic background of universal chaos.”[41](part0015.html#ch4ft-41)\nAnn is alone with a chaotic, indifferent universe. A solitude which,\nparadoxically, draws others to her.\n\nAnne’s intuition of the absolute beyond the dining room window is beautifully\ndescribed by the philosospher Quentin Meillassoux:\n\n> what we see there is a rather menacing power—something insensible, and\n> capable of destroying both things and worlds, of bringing forth monstrous\n> absurdities, yet also of never doing anything, of realizing every dream, but\n> also every nightmare, of engendering random and frenetic transformations, or\n> conversely, of producing a universe that remains motionless down to its\n> ultimate recesses, like a cloud bearing the fiercest storms, then the\n> eeriest bright spells, if only for an interval of disquieting\n> calm.[42](part0015.html#ch4ft-42)\n\nA hyper-chaos, in short, for Bogdanov is not thinkable, but for Ann is the\nvery condition of possibility of knowing Mars at all, since it withdraws in\nadvance any cosmic guarantee for any human project.\n\nAnd yet it’s the kind of thought that finds expression, and adherents, in\nmoments not of cosmic but of social collapse. Struggling with the human,\ntechnical, and “natural” disasters of a failed revolution, Michel says to\nNadia: “These are times that try men’s souls.” And Nadia answers: “Women,\nhowever, do fine.”[43](part0015.html#ch4ft-43) As the arc of the _Trilogy_\nprogresses, the gender balance of the human actants shifts. In the end it will\nbe a victory over both property and patriarchy, but it’s a victory still a\nlong way off when the first volume concludes.\n\n[_GREEN MARS:_ TEKTOLOGY AS REVOLUTION](part0005.html#sec-24)\n\n_Green Mars_ opens in Hiroko’s world, a secret, green enclosure under the\nMartian polar ice cap. It opens too with a next generation character. Nirgal\nis a child of Hiroko’s cyborg-matriarchal clan, as only Shulamith Firestone\ncould imagine.[44](part0015.html#ch4ft-44) Nirgal is caught between not the\nGreen and the Red, but the Green and the White:\n\n> Looking from the green side, when Hiroko confronted something mysterious,\n> she loved it and it made her happy—it was viriditas, a holy power. Looking\n> from the white side, when Sax confronted something mysterious, it was the\n> Great Unexplainable, dangerous and awful. He was interested in the true,\n> while Hiroko was interested in the real. Or perhaps it was the other way\n> around—those words were tricky.[45](part0015.html#ch4ft-45)\n\nNirgal the “ectogene,” raised in a matriarchy, outside of the nuclear family,\nstill has to leave it to come into himself. He becomes a student of Coyote, a\nfellow wanderer. Nirgal is our guide to the Mars underground. Arkady is gone,\nbut most hidden sanctuaries are Bogdanovist, except for Hiroko’s, and those of\nthe francophone utopians, readers of Foucault and\nFourier.[46](part0015.html#ch4ft-46) He will also guide another character, a\nstock one in utopian writing: the visitor from something like our pre-utopian\nworld.\n\nDebord once said, “Yet the highest ambition of the integrated spectacle is\nstill to turn secret agents into revolutionaries, and revolutionaries into\nsecret agents.”[47](part0015.html#ch4ft-47) On Mars, the character who is both\nis called Art. He can be read, among other things, as the stock character of\nthe visitor from our world. Or as a stand-in for the commercial science-\nfiction publishing industry, of which the _Mars Trilogy_ is a mature product,\nwith its ambiguous role of both propagating and co-opting the radical\nimagination.\n\nArt works for Praxis, a somewhat unusual metanational corporation, as a fixer\nand problem-solver. After “eighty continuous years of metastasizing,” Praxis\nis one of the biggest companies, but the aristocratic elite who run it have a\nserious case of _noblesse oblige_.[48](part0015.html#ch4ft-48) Fort, its\npresident, is enamored of the _full world economics_ of Herman Daly: “We have\nbeen liquidating our natural capital as if it were disposable income … man\nmade capital and natural capital are not\nsubstitutable.”[49](part0015.html#ch4ft-49) The goal of Praxis is to get into\nthe _bio-infrastructure_ business, as natural resources have a theoretically\ninfinite price, by acquiring them from distressed countries. As Fort says to\nArt: “We want you to acquire Mars.”[50](part0015.html#ch4ft-50)\n\nArt’s intra-actions with the underground change him. Nirgal insinuates Art\ninto the underground. He introduces Art to the principles of gift economy:\n“Get before you give, and give before you burn.” Art is rather perplexed by\nNirgal’s explanations. “There’s a money economy for the old buy and pay\nsystem, using units of hydrogen peroxide as the money. But most people try to\ndo as much as they can by the nitrogen standard, which is the gift\neconomy.”[51](part0015.html#ch4ft-51)\n\nThe displacement of Red by White reveals also another “color” to the\nrevolutionary flag, and another character: the legendary stowaway, Desmond the\nCoyote, late of Trinidad. Hiroko smuggled him to Mars. They were lovers once,\nbut as Hiroko gathers around herself her matriarchal, polyandrous cult, the\nCoyote becomes a wanderer, moving between underground bases, teaching everyone\nthe principles of eco-economics, with this double economy of gift and\ncommodity. As Coyote says to Nirgal: “We are the primitives of an unknown\ncivilization.”[52](part0015.html#ch4ft-52) He teaches Nirgal the black arts of\nhiding in plain sight.\n\nCoyote is not a great believer in revolutions. “It’s not politics, but\nsurvival.”[53](part0015.html#ch4ft-53) Rather like Platonov, he thinks\nrevolutions are reactive, driven by fear and hunger more than universal\nideals. He is not shy of illegality, just more of an anarchist than any of the\nother characters. He travels between the underground enclaves—Gramsci,\nFourier, Mauss-Hyde, Bogdanov-Visniak, Fourier, Cole, Bellamy, Proudhon—as if\non a caravan across the folds of the critical utopian\narchive.[54](part0015.html#ch4ft-54)\n\nHe is teaching and practicing a new kind of social relation. Coyote: “I’m\nsaving people from their own ridiculous notion of economics, that’s what I’m\ndoing! A gift economy is all very well, but it isn’t organized enough for our\nsituation. There are critical items that everyone has to have, so people\n_have_ to give, which is a contradiction, right?”[55](part0015.html#ch4ft-55)\nCoyote puts into practice the eco-economics worked out in theory by Vlad and\nUrsula. He bargains hard to give more than he gets, just short of _potlaching_\n, which is the problem of ever-increasing gifting.\n\nMeanwhile, Ann is becoming a “bakehead,” wandering too long on the surface of\nMars alone. She survives a landslide, which she just watches and does nothing\nto avoid, her survival a matter of chance, a mere shake of the dice. “It had\nnothing to do with value or fitness; it was pure contingency. Punctuated\nequilibrium, without the equilibrium. Effects did not follow from causes … In\nthe random flux of universal contingency, nothing mattered; and yet, and yet\n…”[56](part0015.html#ch4ft-56)\n\nOn her anabasis, she has a particularly intense vision of molecular red:\n\n> the boulder field took on a weird beauty … The boulders were basalt rocks,\n> which had been scoured by the winds on one exposed surface, until that\n> surface had been scraped flat. Perhaps a million years for the first\n> scraping. And then the underlying clays had been blown away, or a rare mars-\n> quake had shaken the region, and the rock had shifted to a new position,\n> exposing a different surface. And the process had begun again. A new facet\n> would be slowly scraped flat by the ceaseless brushing of micron-sized\n> abrasives, until once again the rock’s equilibrium changed, or another rock\n> bumped it, or else something else shifted it from its position. And then it\n> would start again.[57](part0015.html#ch4ft-57)\n\nWhile she perceives a molecular red world, she cannot see a project that would\norient collective human labor within it. Ann has a vision of all the other\nleading protagonists and their orientation to a kind of tektology, in which\norganizing has an objective, or rather a criteria, but in each case a\ndifferent one. Each wants a “net gain” in something, but not the same\nthing.[58](part0015.html#ch4ft-58) For Vlad and Ursula, the scientists who\ncreated the longevity treatment and then Martian eco-economics, it’s a net\ngain in health. For Hiroko, beauty; for Nadia, goodness; for Maya, intensity;\nfor Arkady, freedom; for Michel, understanding; for Frank, power; for John,\nhappiness; for Sax, complexity. And for Ann? Nothing. She is the only\ncharacter for whom a Meillassouxian nihilism is the ground tone.\n\nStill, Ann’s Redness remains a counterpoint for Sax’s white hot passion for\nthe techno-science of terraforming. “Terraforming isn’t science,” she\ninsists.[59](part0015.html#ch4ft-59) As soon as science has a goal it loses\nits struggle for objectivity in advance. It loses the great outdoors. For Sax,\nfavoring living over non-living systems is a value, a “holding action against\nentropy,” and a struggle for a “net gain in information,” to vary the formula\nonce again.[60](part0015.html#ch4ft-60)\n\nWhat makes all of these variations on the temporal signature of the Carbon\nLiberation Front is that they exclude in advance the narratives of capitalist\nrealism and capitalist romance. Continuous growth, resolving its internal\nimbalance by projecting forward into an open world, is excluded. So too is a\nreturn to homeostasis, a closed loop balanced by some invisible hand or self-\ncorrecting order. Rather, progressive selection has to try to factor in all\nits own byproducts, but without the regulative ideal of a stable ecological\nmodel—that last avatar of God.[61](part0015.html#ch4ft-61)\n\nUnder Ann’s influence, Sax starts to question his own reliance on secondary\nideas alone, of applied science, terraforming, and so forth. For Sax, these\nsecondary ideas keep at bay those deathly ideas of an absolute contingency\nthat are so inimical to life, but to which Ann is in thrall. And yet, Ann\nclaims, and not without justice, that Sax does not _know_ Mars, at least not\nuntil his near death experiences. Sax will be put through trials. One of\nwhich, curiously, is a stroke that causes aphasia. He will lose language, just\nas Ann did, but far more severely. “You should hear the way he can say _bad\nresults_.”[62](part0015.html#ch4ft-62)\n\nLanguage is a key aspect of Robinson’s work. His novels are at once “realist”\nand have a heightened reflexivity about what realism in science fiction might\nentail. One aspect of this is a kind of détournement of scientific lexicons,\nnot unlike Lautréamont’s use of Buffon and other natural history texts in\n_Maldoror_. The _Mars Trilogy_ books anticipate the search-engine age, as they\nbristle with terms that the reader can usefully look up. One can learn that a\nchasmoendolith, a life form that lives in the cracks in rocks, is different\nfrom a cryptoendolith, which gets into their internal cavities. There is even\na fan-generated wiki.[63](part0015.html#ch4ft-63)\n\nThe Sax character himself becomes aware of the problem of language in relation\nto science, and even arrives at an understanding of language as universal\ningression: “Analogies were mostly meaningless—a matter of phenotype rather\nthan genotype (to use another analogy).” For Sax, culture is a “huge\ncompendium of meaningless analogies … a kind of continuous conceptual\ndrunkenness.”[64](part0015.html#ch4ft-64) He thinks Michel’s psychology is a\nmess of analogies. Freud thinks the mind is a steam engine: application of\nheat, pressure buildup, displacement, venting, and so on. Sax imagines the\nmind on the model of the more contemporary sciences that he knows, such as\nclimatology.[65](part0015.html#ch4ft-65) The basic metaphors of causality are\nout of date.\n\nFor Sax, as for Bogdanov, language offers the most plastic medium of\nsubstitution but also the most dangerous, as most of its substitutions will\nnot work at all in another medium. The problem is finding a method of\n_selection_ from language into other practices. It’s a problem for Sax, where\nit would not be for Ann, because of his attempt to find a praxis with a net\ngain. Organizing praxis calls for a theory of history, a language of goals and\nobjectives, even if only a provisional one.[66](part0015.html#ch4ft-66) Praxis\nneeds a conceptual space which relates knowable pasts to possible futures.\n\nBut it won’t be a teleology. History has no plan. There is no horizon to\norient toward, no line from present to future. “In that regard there was a\nsimilarity between history and evolution, both of them being matters of\ncontingency and accident, as well as patterns of development. But the\ndifferences, particularly in time scales, were so gross as to make the\nsimilarity nothing more than analogy again … History _directing_ evolution. It\nwas a daunting thought.”[67](part0015.html#ch4ft-67) The goal of science,\nexternal to it but orienting it, would ideally be a science of history. “He\nneeded a science of history, but unfortunately there was no such thing.\nHistory is Lamarckian, as Arkady used to say.”[68](part0015.html#ch4ft-68)\n\nOr could be, or should be. If only we could acquire characteristics that have\nsurvival value and pass them on. We still tend to think that if we _stop_\ncertain actions, an ecology will right itself and return to homeostasis. But\nperhaps that is not the case. Negative action might not be enough. It might\ntake positive actions to create a new ingression. What if on the actual Earth,\nas on this fictional Mars, there is no ecology? What if there is only an\nunstable nature, a progressive selection, here on Earth too? What if it was a\nmatter of continuous conscious adaptation through experimental variation via\nthe détournement of existing forms?\n\nThe journey of the Sax character is one of finding a place along a continuum\nfrom rational, model-based science toward a more empirical and contingent one.\nHe is representative of scientists as a class. “They were apolitical,\nsupposedly, like civil servants—empiricists, who only wanted things managed in\na rational scientific style, the greatest good for the greatest number, which\nought to be fairly simple to arrange, if people were not so trapped in\nemotions, religions, governments, and other mass delusional systems of that\nsort.”[69](part0015.html#ch4ft-69)\n\nHe is the godfather of terraforming, and still attracted to vast geo-\nengineering projects, particularly of the climate. The estrangement device\nhere is that the problem on Mars is one of raising temperatures, rather than\nlowering them: “Sax moved on, a little smile fixed on his face. Twelve\ndegrees! Now that was something!—over twenty percent of all the warming they\nneeded, and all by the early and continuous deployment of a nicely designed\ngas cocktail. It was elegant, it truly was. There was something so comforting\nabout simple physics.”[70](part0015.html#ch4ft-70) Part of the project of\n_Green Mars_ is to put this “accelerationist” glee in dialogue with tempering\nideologies, without losing this sense of scale.\n\nWhat brings Sax to an awareness of the problem with science in its complicity\nwith the metanats is his encounter with what should be a kind of utopia—the\nscientific conference. But metanat-sponsored science becomes a war of\ncompeting corporate agendas. “Everyone knew what was going on, and no one\nliked it, and yet no one would admit it.”[71](part0015.html#ch4ft-71) The aim\nof this science is nothing scientific. Sax does not abandon science for\nHiroko’s mysticism, or retreat into Ann’s merely contemplative version of\nscience. He starts to see that the passion of reason is the pull toward death,\nnot just in Ann but in himself.\n\nSax embarks on a double project of bringing science to politics and politics\nto science. Fredric Jameson: “any first scientific reading of the _Mars\nTrilogy_ must eventually develop into a second allegorical one, in which the\nhard SF content stands revealed as socio-political—that is to say, as\nutopian.”[72](part0015.html#ch4ft-72) What is lacking from this reading is its\ndialectical complement. Any socio-political reading can also develop a\nsecondary reading in which the utopian content intersects with its\nscientific—hard SF—determinants.\n\nActually it doesn’t stop there. The _Mars Trilogy_ stages encounters between\notherwise _incommensurable_ kinds of knowledge organization: science both pure\nand applied, engineering, design, politics, culture, religion, folklore, and\nso on.[73](part0015.html#ch4ft-73) It’s not that there’s a synthesis to be\nhad. Rather, it’s that each mode of knowing, and hence each layer of possible\nreading of the _Mars Trilogy_ itself, can be usefully framed by another, which\ncontains within it the positive, functional, working ideology of some\ncomponent of the labor process as a whole. In this respect the _Mars Trilogy_\nis a work about tektology.\n\nFor Sax after his tribulations, as for Bogdanov after his, the useful framing\nknowledge comes from natural history. Sax makes his own observations in the\nfield. Natural history is a real science, and “it had discovered, there among\nthe contingency and disorder, some valid general principles of\nevolution—development, adaptation,\ncomplexification.”[74](part0015.html#ch4ft-74) He does not abandon the\nmodeling central to his original training in theoretical physics, but rather\nstarts to take a more skeptical approach to it, to put cognition and sensation\ntogether more tentatively. All his field observations are of a wildly unstable\nnature, and like Bogdanov, he has already experienced the wild instability of\npolitical time. He comes to see scientific time as—at times—unhelpfully\nartificial.\n\n“Here on Mars all kinds of hierarchies were destined to\nfall.”[75](part0015.html#ch4ft-75) The problem of the _Mars Trilogy_ is not\nunlike that of _Foundation Pit_ , a problem of base and superstructure. Only\nhere the superstructure already exists, at least _in potentia_. The scientific\nstation is a working model of a superstructure. But it has to build its own\nbase. It has to construct a nature that will support it.\n\nThe centerpiece of the middle volume is a conference of all the underground\nfactions, hosted by the matriarchal Dorsa Brevia enclave. It is a negotiation\nbetween at least four kinds of vision for Mars. Coyote the anarchist has very\nlittle interest, and so the four parties are the Red, the Green, the White,\nand what one might call the multicultural question. How can a just society\naccommodate different ways of life? What are the limits to acceptable\ndifference? Who gets to decide on the boundaries of exclusion?\n\nInterestingly, Robinson seems to draw here on two preoccupations of late\ntwentieth-century thought that often had little to do with each other:\nmulticulturalism and civil society.[76](part0015.html#ch4ft-76) The former\ncame out of the critique of colonialism, combined with American experiences of\nthe politics of race, gender, and sexuality. The latter arose out of the\nexperience of post-Soviet societies in transition. The Martians arrive, at\ntheir Dorsa Brevia convention, at a vision of a polyarchic society of\nfederated city-states, bound by something like a new _Declaration of\nIndependence_.\n\nThis Dorsa Brevia manifesto is a synthesis, in displaced form, not only of\nTerran civil society and multicultural thinking, but also of socialist and\necological economics. The land, air, and water are a commons. One of its key\ntheses is: “The goal of Martian economics is not ‘sustainable development’ but\na sustainable prosperity for its entire\nbiosphere.”[77](part0015.html#ch4ft-77)\n\nHow is the Dorsa Brevia manifesto to become a reality? Nirgal is out\ntraveling, like Coyote but less hidden, and among those who are enacting Dorsa\nBrevia in their everyday lives. “They were agronomists, ecological engineers,\nconstruction workers, technicians, technocrats, city operators, service\npersonnel.”[78](part0015.html#ch4ft-78) These are the twenty-first-century\nequivalent of Bogdanov’s class-conscious industrial workers.\n\nMeanwhile, Maya divides her time between hydrology work for Praxis, the\nunderground, and enjoying the new Martian theater and music. “Politics needed\nto coopt some of that erotic energy, or else it was only a matter of\n_ressentiment_ and damage control.”[79](part0015.html#ch4ft-79) Maya and the\nothers from the First Hundred want to prevent “another October.” They are like\nMensheviks, educating and proselytizing, holding back, waiting for the right\nconjuncture, and not trying to force the pace of history. “It was\nfrightening—as if history were a series of human wave assaults on misery\nfailing time after time.”[80](part0015.html#ch4ft-80) With Coyote, Maya fears\nthe merely destructive leap.\n\nThey are waiting for the trigger, the spark, to restart the revolution. Back\non Earth, the western Antarctic ice sheet collapses, causing sea levels to\nrise everywhere. Curiously, global warming is happening on this Earth, but\nRobinson does not make it the cause of the ice sheet falling into the sea. It\nis as if, in Bogdanovite style, one needs to pay attention not just to\npredictable challenges to organization. There is more than one metabolic rift,\ncaused by all sorts of molecular liberation fronts, interacting in\nunpredictable ways.[81](part0015.html#ch4ft-81)\n\nWhile the rising seas divert attention and resources on Earth, the Martians\nlaunch their revolution, and like most revolutions, it suspends habit as well\nas law. They can be understood via a kind of tektology. Nadia the engineer:\n\n> Melting occurred when the thermal energy of particles was great enough to\n> overcome inter-crystalline forces that held them in position. So if you\n> considered the metanat order as the crystalline structure … But then it made\n> a huge difference if the forces holding it together were interionic or\n> intermolecular; interionic, sodium chloride, melted at 801C, methane,\n> intermolecular, at –183C. What kind of forces, then? And how high the\n> temperature?[82](part0015.html#ch4ft-82)\n\nThis time, the temperature is right.\n\n[_BLUE MARS:_ AFTER UTOPIA](part0005.html#sec-25)\n\nLike Bogdanov, Robinson finds that the interesting problems begin after the\nmoment of revolution, not before it. Curiously it is Sax who grasps the power\nof the symbolic gesture. He destroys the soletta, which gathers and magnifies\nsunlight, as a concession to the Reds, to bring them back within the fold of a\nconstitutional politics. The Greens will have to work harder to make up for\nthe loss of their artificially augmented sun.\n\nCultural revolution, or “a new collective unconscious,” plays a significant\nrole in the transition to a new mode of production, much as Bogdanov thought\nit should.[83](part0015.html#ch4ft-83) It is not just that the Martians have\nnew ideas, but that their new ideas organize new kinds of social relation.\nMichel: “On Mars it may be that the ego ideal is shifting back to the\nmaternal. To the Dionysian again. Or to some kind of post-oedipal\nreintegration with nature, which we are still in the process of inventing.\nSome new complex that would not be subject to neurotic over-\ninvestment.”[84](part0015.html#ch4ft-84) Or perhaps it is a twenty-first-\ncentury version of proletkult, an organic ideological product of self-\norganizing labor, learning from experience how to work with both objective and\nsubjective resistances.\n\nTurning the Dorsa Brevia manifesto into an actual constitution is no easy\nfeat. It calls for another convention, and more rounds of furious politicking.\nArt: “It’s kind of scary … Win a revolution and a bunch of lawyers pop out of\nthe woodwork.”[85](part0015.html#ch4ft-85) What Fourier called the cabalist\npassion has free reign here, and by some sort of “flocking algorithm” a new\nconstitution emerges, and a first chair of the executive council: Nadia,\nbecause “she had the charisma of the sensible.”[86](part0015.html#ch4ft-86)\n\nThe Martian post-revolutionary state manages to keep its radical commitment to\nthe abolition of private property. The strongest advocate of this is Vlad\nTaneev, the co-inventor of the longevity treatment. Having seen extended life,\nhis creation, denied to people on Earth by the commodification of medical\nscience, he is passionate about overcoming the residues of feudal privilege.\n“That is what capitalism is—a version of feudalism in which capital replaces\nland, and business leaders replace kings … If democracy and self-rule are the\nfundamentals, then why should people give up these rights when they enter the\nworkplace?”\n\nVlad reminds them that the Dorsa Brevia manifesto “says everyone’s work is\ntheir own, and the worth of it cannot be taken away. It says that the various\nmodes of production belong to those who created them, and to the common good\nof the future generations. It says that the world is something we all steward\ntogether.”[87](part0015.html#ch4ft-87) While some think these ideas smack of\nold-fashioned socialism, Vlad insists that to defeat capitalism it is worth\nlooking back to those social forms that capital itself defeated.\n\nThe centerpiece of _Blue Mars_ is the return to Earth of Coyote, Michel,\nNirgal, and others. Here Robinson works a double estrangement, showing Earth\ntransformed by rising sea levels from the alien point of view of Martian\nrevolutionaries. “We are the primitives of an unknown civilization,” Nirgal\ntells the Terran crowds, détourning a line from Coyote’s\nteachings.[88](part0015.html#ch4ft-88) Back in his homeland of Trinidad it is\nCoyote who is the hero, nicely displacing the First World characters among the\nFirst Hundred. Michel finds his native Provence both familiar and strange. The\nbeaches are gone and will never return, but Arles is connected once more to\nthe sea, and once again rivals Marseille as a port town.\n\nRobinson’s most striking image is of the Thames estuary, where a new inter-\ntidal civilization is being cobbled together. “And then the wind turned and\npoured over the tide, and all of the waves were suddenly rushing out to sea\ntogether. Among the long cakes of foam were floating objects of all kinds:\nboxes, furniture, roofs, entire houses, capsized boats, pieces of wood.\nFlotsam and jetsam … ‘It’s London,’ Bly said, ‘It’s fucking London, washing\nout to sea.’”[89](part0015.html#ch4ft-89) Diving down around an abandoned,\nflooded village, “Nirgal swam slowly around the wedge-shaped building, looking\nin second story windows at offices, empty rooms, flats. Some furniture floated\nagainst the ceilings.”[90](part0015.html#ch4ft-90)\n\nThe landscape of Mars is no less unstable: “The land was slumping in all its\ncharacteristic permafrost patterns: polygonal pebble ridges, concentric crater\nfill, pingos, solifluction ridges on the hillsides. In every depression an\nice-choked pond or puddle. The land was melting.”[91](part0015.html#ch4ft-91)\nAnn struggles with the concept of a _Red aerophany_ , distinct from Hiroko’s\nconflation of aerophany with viriditas. Is there a way to stand in relation to\nthe unliving universe that does not privilege life? She wants to know how to\nlive with an absolutely flat ontology in an age when ontology is dead.\n\nNadia finds herself enmeshed in one political crisis after another, but she\nand her factional backers insist that process is the most important thing\nabout politics. Some of it is a cobbling together of many old ideas for\nlimiting the concentration of power, such as electing representatives by\nlottery.[92](part0015.html#ch4ft-92) They resist the cult of personality that\nhas developed around Jackie Boone and her party. Some of the new process\ninvolves new objectives, like legislating the height of the sea level, or\nrationing the heat each city can put into the atmosphere.\n\nNadia really wants to return to engineering, but there is no heavy machinery\nfor her to drive any more. Most things are automated. She turns to the problem\nof making soil, but it turns out be as much a molecular art as a science:\n\n> There were the macro-nutrients—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,\n> phosphorous, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium—there were the micro-\n> nutrients, including iron, manganese, zinc, copper, molybdenum, boron, and\n> chlorine. None of these nutrient cycles was closed, as there were losses due\n> to leaching, erosion, harvesting, and outgassing; inputs were just as\n> various, including absorption, weathering, microbial action, and application\n> of fertilizers.[93](part0015.html#ch4ft-93)\n\nMetabolic rifting and cleaving is no simple thing.\n\nWith the revolution won, Nirgal does not know what to do with himself. Jackie\nBoone has taken over the party of which he was once the charismatic center.\n“He wanted to settle into a full human life, to pick a place and stay there,\nto learn it completely, in all its seasons, to grow his food, make his house\nand his tools, become part of a community of\nfriends.”[94](part0015.html#ch4ft-94) For Nirgal as opposed to Jackie,\npolitics was always a matter of everyday life rather than holding office or\nruling a faction.\n\nHe is attracted to the teachings of some Zen gardeners, who “talked about\necopoesis, which for them was terraforming redefined, subtilized, localized.\nTransformed into something like Hiroko’s aeroformation. No longer powered by\nheavy industrial global methods, but by the slow, steady, and intensely local\nprocess of working on individual patches of land.”[95](part0015.html#ch4ft-95)\nHe becomes an ecopoet. Like Thoreau, he tends his small corner of the world.\nBut his plants are attacked by a viroid, which requires the most advanced\nscience even to diagnose, and in the end a dust storm buries his whole world\nin a meter of mud. The world is not a garden.\n\nAs Sax says, “There’s all kinds of invasions going on. Population surges,\nsudden die-offs. All over. Things in disequilibrium. Upsetting balances we\ndidn’t even know existed. Things we don’t under-\nstand.”[96](part0015.html#ch4ft-96) Sax has been cured of his earlier belief\nin mathematics as a kind of ontological reality, even if he is no less\nconvinced of its modeling power. “Over and over Sax watched a thousand years\nof weather, altering variables in the models, and every time a completely\ndifferent millennium flitted past. Fascinating.”[97](part0015.html#ch4ft-97)\nIn an expanding universe, order isn’t order. It might just be the difference\nbetween actual and potential entropy. Humans mistake the difference for order.\nSax is as committed to scientific methods as ever, but the sheer resistance of\nnature to method makes itself felt in him.\n\nSax does not abandon science. “It was surely one of the greatest achievements\nof the human spirit, a kind of stupendous pantheon of the mind, constantly a\nwork in progress, like a symphonic epic poem of thousands of stanzas, being\ncomposed by them all in a giant ongoing conversation. The language of the poem\nwas mathematics …”[98](part0015.html#ch4ft-98) Rather, he puts it in the\nperspective of labor’s struggle in and against nature. “Science was a social\nconstruct, but it was also and most importantly its own space, conforming to\nreality only, that was its beauty.”[99](part0015.html#ch4ft-99) There is\nsomething inhuman about science. Its modes of perception, modeling, and\nverifying are outside the parameters of the human sensorium, even though they\nare dependent on an apparatus that is itself the product of human labor. The\nobjects of science are not dependent on human consciousness. And yet science\nhappens in history, constrained by forms of social organization of a given\ntype and of a given time. As such, existing social relations are a fetter upon\nscience in its pursuit of the inhuman sensations of the nonhuman real.\n\nMartian utopian science looks not unlike how Bogdanov imagined Soviet science\ncould be organized. It’s Sax’s experience of the elite research lab or field\nstation generalized:\n\n> As he watched them Sax realized for the first time that the versatile,\n> responsive, highly focused nature of science that he had been getting used\n> to … was a feature of all the labs arranged as cooperative ventures … With\n> the scientists in control of their own work, to a degree never seen in his\n> youth on Earth, the work itself had an unprecedented rapidity and\n> power.[100](part0015.html#ch4ft-100)\n\nIf _Blue Mars_ is a realized utopia, then one of the tests of its utopian\nquality is the status of art within this world. Robinson offers several\nversions of what becomes of art. One is Harry Whitebrook, the genetic\nengineer, who invents whole classes of organism as if they were works of art.\nAnother is Coyote’s version of the early Situationist slogan: “Never work!” As\nhe explains: “What I like to do … is to go to a sidewalk café and toss down\nsome kava and watch all the faces. Go for a walk around the streets and look\nat people’s faces.”[101](part0015.html#ch4ft-101) Perhaps in effect the whole\norganization of the planet has become an artwork, although one heavily\ndependent on, and respectful of, scientific method.\n\nHistory merges with natural history, which both Sax and Ann describe as\n“punctuated equilibrium without the\nequilibrium.”[102](part0015.html#ch4ft-102) Sax: “See how beautiful it is—in\nits own way. In itself, the way it organizes itself. We say we manage it, but\nwe don’t. It’s too complex. We just brought it here. After that it took off on\nits own. Now we try to push it this way and that, but the total biosphere …\nit’s self organizing. There’s nothing unnatural about\nit.”[103](part0015.html#ch4ft-103)\n\nBut while natural history might be self-organizing, it is not homeostatic.\nThere is no invisible hand at work in either natural or human affairs. One\nsubstitution that Robinson, like Bogdanov, resists, is to see nature as an\n_ecology_ , as like a market, and markets as therefore also, by reverse-\nsubstitution, “natural.” The emphasis is rather on the instability of the\nrelations of the new Martian species to each other and their world, “all of\nthem monsters together.”[104](part0015.html#ch4ft-104) There may be patches of\nrelative ecological stability, but they are local and temporary. To dispense\nwith the invisible hand, and with homeostatic ecology as a basic metaphor, is\nto live once again after God is dead.\n\nWhen his farm fails, Nirgal’s new version of “Never work!” is running. He runs\nraces around the entire planet, his victories full of “counter intuitive\nextravagance.”[105](part0015.html#ch4ft-105) Out on a training run, he falls\nin with a nomadic feral co-op of hunters, gatherers, and farmers. Without the\nboundary lines and fences of private property, the landscape grows into a\nnetwork of forms built as much as anything for wandering. It’s like Constant\nNieuwenhuys’s utopian project _New Babylon_ , only on Mars rather than Earth.\nThis is a world, as Sax says, of “so many different kinds of\nnomads.”[106](part0015.html#ch4ft-106)\n\nWhen Nirgal meets Zoya (or Zo) among the ferals, he does not know he is\nactually her father. She is a “wild” character, a thrill-seeker. She loves to\nfly with a bird suit. For Robinson, the question of what a utopian sport might\nbe looms even larger than the question of a utopian art. For Zo, “this was the\nmeaning of life, the purpose of the universe: pure joy, the sense of self gone\n… The best, cleanest use of human time.”[107](part0015.html#ch4ft-107) Apart\nfrom a little diplomatic arm-twisting as her mother Jackie Boone’s enforcer,\nZo lives without dead time.\n\nAlongside utopian art and sport, there’s utopian sex, not unlike that in\nFourier, with his emphasis on the combination of all the passions, on groups,\nand on tableaux. Here is Zo being _tabled_ by friends of various sexes: “And\nthen the whole group was on her, hands and mouths and genitals, a tongue in\neach ear, in her mouth, contact everywhere; after a while it was an\nundifferentiated mass of erotic sensation, total sexurround, Zo purring\nloudly.”[108](part0015.html#ch4ft-108)\n\n_Blue Mars_ is not a closed world utopia. Zo meets the builders of a new life\non the Jovian moons, “throwing themselves so energetically into a project that\nwon’t be completed until long after their death—it’s an absurd gesture, a\ngesture of defiance and freedom, a divine madness\n…”[109](part0015.html#ch4ft-109) It’s like Bogdanov’s Red Martians, sending\nthe seeds of life into the universe.\n\nIn this paradise, Robinson broaches a rare topic: what does utopian ageing and\ndeath look like? Maya suffers from _jamais vu_.[110](part0015.html#ch4ft-110)\nEach day seems an exact repetition of another, an eternal return. Jackie, her\npersonal powers fading, joins a voyage out of the solar system. Sax can no\nlonger hold a train of thought long enough to document it. The longevity\ntreatments keep these cyborg bodies in a zone of complexity between the too\norderly and the too chaotic, but they have their limits.\n\nThis utopia even has its own kind of revolution. Earth invades Mars by sending\nunauthorized colonists; the “native” Martians respond by embracing them and\nabsorbing them into their world. The most effective tactic, as in the two\nprevious Martian revolutions, is “people in the\nstreets.”[111](part0015.html#ch4ft-111) In this post-colonial confrontation,\nthe natives have a higher level not only of cultural but also of technical\norganization, and prevail.\n\nHere are utopia’s three achievements: “Nowhere on this world were people\nkilling each other, nowhere were they desperate for shelter or food, nowhere\nwere they scared for their kids.”[112](part0015.html#ch4ft-112) Perhaps\nnothing should be said of the good life beyond the principle that nobody\nshould go hungry. Not every possibility for “development” need be opened up.\nAs in Platonov, the more labor dug into nature, the more nature presses down\nin return.\n\nOn Mars, not every kind of development is pursued. Sax withdraws his support\nfor terraforming at any price when he destroys the soletta. The question in\nRobinson is not the refusal but the _selection_ among kinds of development.\nThe value of science fiction as a form is in organizing blocks of possible\ncausation.[113](part0015.html#ch4ft-113) It is a laboratory of substitutions\nfor the basic metaphor itself. Robinson’s writing is rich in causational\nmodels: the coriolis effect, flocking algorithms, punctuated equilibrium,\ncascading recombinant chaos, and so on. _The Mars Trilogy_ is particularly\nrich in geological causal substitutions. Science fiction is, or at least can\nbe, a method for testing out new basic metaphors. In Robinson’s hands, it is a\ndialogic procedure. Characters play out different organizational practices and\ncorresponding ideologies, particularly ones that work out various basic\nmetaphors and their attendant chains of substitution.\n\nWhile in a very different key, Robinson shares with Platonov a sense that a\nrevolutionary praxis has to be more than a religion, rather than less.\nExtracting a surplus from recalcitrant nature makes life possible, and this in\nturn is the condition of existence, in Platonov’s terms, of the soul. But it\nis no guarantee of one. Utopian life only poses more completely the problem of\nhow one is to live. This is what makes _Blue Mars_ the most interesting of the\nvolumes. It is a kind of _meta-utopia_. It is a détournement made of many\nutopias—some marked by the place names to which Coyote travels—but not a\nsynthesis of them. It stages the conflicts; it respects their\nincommensurability.\n\nPlatonov documents all too vividly how the struggle for life under acute and\ntrying circumstances can fail, how disorganization accumulates, how\ninformation is lost forever and in the process a whole ontology collapses in\non itself. It is not that Robinson holds out hope for another fate. Rather, it\nis that he practices a different kind of realism. One that tests different\ncausal sequences—like Sax running the climate simulator from different\nstarting conditions over and over (if one can pardon the analogy). Based on\nlanguage, it is a tektology that is much more open than “the craft of\nconstrained storytelling,” as Haraway calls it, of the sciences. And yet it is\nstill bounded by the way labor might actually organize the\nworld.[114](part0015.html#ch4ft-114)\n\nAt least one version of this “dialectic,” if that is what it still is, finds\nin catastrophic moments the possibility of new kinds of organization. It is\nnot so much a leap beyond material circumstances as a march right into them.\nIt has happened before. Robinson is fascinated by the proposition that a\nprevious era of climate change—the Ice Ages—forced forward momentum in human\nbiological but also cultural evolution. In his tektological laboratory,\nclimate crisis might be the moment for the _accelerando_ as one possible\ncausal sequence.[115](part0015.html#ch4ft-115)\n\nTektology in Robinson is a turn toward those sciences and technical knowledges\nthat can ground an understanding and a praxis that combine work on a resistant\nobjective world and the resistant subjectivity of politics and culture. He has\nfound a form in which the incommensurable statements from both technical and\norganizational labor can meet on the same page without being reduced one to\nthe other. It’s a “laboratory of history” for thinking the twenty-first-\ncentury condition.[116](part0015.html#ch4ft-116)\n\n\n## [Conclusion](part0005.html#con)\n\nThe sheer scale of the misanthropocene. Our minds feel small and inert. Once\nevery fragment seemed to bear within it the whole. Now the whole being too\nlarge for the mind to see stands before us always as a fragment.\n\n—Joshua Clover and Juliana Spahr\n\nThe earnest enthusiasms of youth later come to seem like follies, but are even\nmore enthusiastically embraced as follies, when everything else in everyday\nlife has to be lived so much in earnest. The past is where the lightness\nlives. It can be the same with the historical past, although there the\ntemptation to nostalgia, while no less earnest, is far more foolish.\n\nAs a young militant, I worked for a time in the regional party headquarters, a\nneat and austere place, with a bookshop, library, meeting rooms, and an offset\nprinting press—an imposing thing I never learned to work. In the front office,\nportraits of Marx and Lenin stared down from their nails on the wall. It\nstruck me as odd that in so well organized an office the portraits were hung\noff-kilter, rather than symmetrically mounted.\n\nOne day I noticed that while there were two portraits on the wall, of Marx and\nLenin, there were three nails. When I remarked on this, it was explained to me\nthat sometime during Khrushchev’s thaw, Stalin’s portrait had come down. The\nnail from which it once hung was still there.\n\nThe Communist Party of Australia was an unusual one.[1](part0015.html#conft-1)\nWhen the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, those who supported the\ncrushing of the “Prague Spring” found themselves in a minority. The majority\ncontinued under the name of the Communist Party, which of course ceased to\nhave “fraternal ties” with its Soviet counterpart. So Stalin’s portrait had\ncome down, but not those of Marx or Lenin, who were taught in the party\nschool, together with Antonio Gramsci and even Leon Trotsky. I sat in party\nschool next to a metalworker with a finger missing and dirt under his nine\nnails.\n\nThe break with Moscow broke the rudder of ideological certainty, setting the\nparty slowly but surely adrift. Yet it remained, even in the late 1970s, a\nreal party: a power in the trade unions, an affective node within several\ninfluential social movements, with an inter-generational and inter-class\nculture, and a presence on the campuses. It was still just possible to imagine\nthat the party was at least a small part of a vast alliance of humans in\nstruggle, even if increasingly submerged within it. It had spawned at least\none innovative tactic in the 1970s. Upon gaining control of the Builders\nLaborers’ Federation, the union would not only “Black Ban” working on sites in\nstruggle against the employers. It would also “Green Ban” sites deemed\nenvironmentally harmful.[2](part0015.html#conft-2)\n\nAround the corner from the District Party Office in my home town was the\noffice of the Trade Union Environment Centre. It was run by party members,\nalthough apparently there had nearly been a split. The short walk between the\ntwo headquarters mapped the distance between these two factions. At the\nCentre, books by Barry Commoner were pressed into my\nhands.[3](part0015.html#conft-3) It was here that I met the famous instigators\nof the Green Bans when they visited. At the Centre was an exciting sense of\nstarting to think completely anew about what the conceptual basis of politics\nmight become. The Centre thought it had escaped out from under those dusty\nportraits.\n\nThe most interesting thing to me in the District Party Office was the offset\nprinting press. It was about the size of a washing-machine but considerably\nnoisier. Sometimes I would assist the comrade printer who worked with it. Like\na character out of Platonov, he understood machines. The principles of its\noperation were simple and even I grasped them quickly. But the machine was\nold, and the real work lay in gently tweaking the feeding of the paper, the\npressure of the rollers, the precise interactions of ink and solvent. The\nmachine was sensitive not just to different kinds of paper and ink but to\ntemperature and humidity.\n\nIt was a delicate thing, but when the comrade printer turned it on, all the\nlights in the building would dim. Once, it tripped the circuit breaker,\nplunging the Party Office into an inky darkness. The power of this thing to\nmake texts still depended on a whole network of objects, barely perceptible,\nuntil you crashed the system.[4](part0015.html#conft-4)\n\nIt was a quiet day in the Office. I was minding the bookstore and reading an\nold edition of Lenin borrowed from the library in the back. It was a handsome\ntwo-volume set published in Moscow, I forget in which year. I don’t remember\nwhich text I was reading, but upon turning the page, I was surprised to\ndiscover that half of it was neatly covered by a blank white sheet that had\nbeen pasted over half a paragraph. Even then I could grasp what this shocking\ndiscovery meant. Someone had become a non-person, in that brief period between\nthe editing of this edition and its printing.\n\nIn one way or another, Bogdanov and Platonov were both non-people as far as\nMarxist-Leninist thought was concerned. Lenin himself did his best to minimize\nthe significance of Bogdanov. Perversely enough, he lived on mostly through\nLenin’s virulent denunciation of him in _Materialism and Empirio-criticism_.\nNone of Platonov’s most extraordinary works of the 1920s and 1930s were\nprinted until many years later.\n\nThese are all obscured pages, and not just in the now defunct Soviet\northodoxy. They were obscure to the Western Marxist tradition until quite\nrecently as well. I’m no scholar of Russian literature or of Soviet history.\nMy only claim to a relevant competence came from party school, long ago. It is\nto a non-standard Marxism that I want to restore them. But I do claim that\nthese other Marxist passages can open onto a way of organizing knowledge in\nthe present, in anticipation of the Carbon Liberation Front’s more novel\neffects.\n\nIt is hard to orient oneself, let alone a movement, as an intellectual orphan.\nIt helps to have some elective kin and kind, and some legends of thought-in-\naction. The New Left remade the intellectual past, but that new past is now\npast as well, and we need others. Bogdanov and Platonov hint at where some\nmight lie buried. But Marxism hangs in the shadow of the histories those\nportraits on the wall efface.\n\nOne of the great virtues of the Marxist tradition used to be its indifference\nto the formal constraints of traditional disciplinary knowledge. It sought an\norganic rigor independent of that game. Starting with Marx and Engels\nthemselves, at their best Marxists developed a working method for traversing\ndisciplinary boundaries and for combining lessons learned from a range of\npractices, from scientific experiment to the struggles of everyday life.\n\nSometimes Marxism was misconstrued as a dogma applicable to all fields of\nknowledge and practice. As a corrective, the current known as Western Marxism\nrestored an earnest philosophical rigor to Marxist\ninquiry.[5](part0015.html#conft-5) But this came at the price, in the long\nrun, of giving up the interstitial practice of networking between knowledges,\nin favor of a retreat back into the traditional field of philosophy as the\nuniversity delimits it.\n\nSubsumed within professional academic practice, Marxism falls prey to a kind\nof agenda-drift. It becomes more interested in the game within the scholarly\nfield than in situations impinging from without. This got so bad that by the\nearly twenty-first century you could read the leading inheritors of the\nWestern Marxist tradition in vain for any hint that the fate of “modernity”\nhad come to turn on the liberation of carbon.[6](part0015.html#conft-6)\n\nWhat flourished instead was an obsession with the detritus left behind by an\nobsolete bourgeois public sphere. Western Marxism and its heirs got caught up\nin the languages of the cultural, the political, or even the old theological\nsuperstructures. It substituted metaphors from its own intellectual labor\npractices onto the world, producing worldviews rich in the doings of\nphilosophy or linguistics or psychoanalysis, but not those of cyborg labor or\ncontemporary sciences. It’s a question then of either abandoning the shade of\nWestern Marxism to its tomfoolery, or reinventing it as a critical tradition\nfor labor to confront that within which it is entangled.\n\nLabor is the mingling of many things, most of them not human. Where Bogdanov\ntalks of the labor point of view, this is something of an inhuman perspective,\nalmost already a cyborg point of view, in which the human organism and its\nmachines interleave in an apparatus. It’s like the comrade printer and his\npress, or Platonov’s engineers and their machines, or Robinson’s scientists\nand their labs.\n\nLabor is a prism through which to construct a version of Marx that does not\ndisappear into the cultural, political, or theological problem of the\nsubject.[7](part0015.html#conft-7) It is not so much that it is objective,\nhowever. It is not about making a claim to have the true method. Rather, it is\nabout the struggle of and within the realm of things, of how things organize\nthemselves and how they might—through labor—become otherwise. The turn toward\nthe object, as something that exceeds subjectivity in scale, can undo the\ndamage done by the fascination with the great molar dramas, which appear as\nthe clash of superhuman subjects, but subjects nonetheless.\n\nOn the other hand, it isn’t progress to make the object a mere object of\ncontemplation. This is the old sensuous materialism that Marx so decisively\nleft. Rather, the labor point of view is a field of sensations, of a mediating\napparatus, of a molecular process, which both feeds the appetites of\ncollective human needs, but also opens up rifts in tektological wholes. It\nmight be better to craft an inconsistent field of thought from the labor point\nof view than a consistent line centered on some avatar of the object or\nsubject—as contemporary philosophy is still wont to do.\n\nIt’s time for other stories. One thing, strangely, that the Soviet Union and\nits American Cold War nemesis had in common was a clear understanding that any\nnarrative for a whole way of life has to _scale_.[8](part0015.html#conft-8) It\nhad to work for millions, even billions. The challenge then is to take the\ndesire for alternatives from the romantic anti-capitalists and wed it to the\ngrand scale on which capitalist realism imagines itself now to be the only\ndiscourse.\n\nThere used to be a third species of narrative, which took Marx’s thought to be\nthe seed-stock for a critique of the bedtime stories of both the superpowers,\nand claimed the same world historical remit. It went under several names,\nincluding Western Marxism and critical theory.[9](part0015.html#conft-9) It\nused to think big, now it rarely does. It has not proven as sharp as one might\nlike in confronting the problem of the metabolic rift. Critical theory became\n_hypocritical theory_.\n\nOne of the aims in _Molecular Red_ has been to take two steps back into\nrelatively neglected parts of the critical theory tradition to take three\nsteps forward again, into the Anthropocene breach. That tradition still has\nthe advantage of not taking capitalism itself to be a natural given thing. Our\nstory takes place within the archives of mutating Marxisms, but requires a\nseries of _reversals of perspective_ that steer it away from some of its\nhypocritical habits.[10](part0015.html#conft-10)\n\nFirst—and last: _from bourgeois to proletarian_. Hypocritical theory is in\nlove with the lovely things of its own class—bourgeois things. It makes a\nfetish of leaders, idolizing Lenin or Mao. It doesn’t want to talk about\nworkers; it wants to deal only with the representatives. Or: it finds excuses\nto remain within the detritus of a lost bourgeois culture—Wagner, Hegel, and\nMallarmé. Or: it takes refuge in theology, as if only the Gods could save us.\nOr: it defaults into disciplinary loyalties and border skirmishes, as if no\ncritique of its organization of intellectual labor need be ventured.\n\nSecond: _from high theory to low theory_. Rather than imagine theory as a\npolicing faculty flying high as a drone over all the others, a low theory is\ninterstitial, its labor communicative rather than controlling. Its method is\nsome species of détournement, such as tektology or the factory of literature\nor dada. It refracts affects, perceptions, and concepts from one domain of\nlabor to another using whatever apparatus is to hand. The verification of\nwhether a concept holds, or a story applies, is specific to each labor\nprocess. Theory proposes; practice disposes. It does not set its own agenda\nbut detects those emerging in key situations and alerts each field to the\nagendas of the others.\n\nThird: _from schism to system_. Hypocritical theory got rather interested in\nsplits and rifts, voids and aporias, but not metabolic ones. It is interested\nin nonidentity, supplements, incommensurability, how internally divided our\nsubjectivity is, and how antagonisms structure politics. But its substitutions\nbegin from the political or cultural superstructures, and it starts to imagine\nthat “division goes all the way down.”[11](part0015.html#conft-11) It loses\nsight of the feedback loops which reticulate through the levels of social and\nnatural existence. One would not want to impose the opposite metaphor,\nhowever, where everything consists of autotelic, autopoetic, homeostatic,\nself-governing systems. Totalities turn out in practice to be rather less\ntotal. Haraway: “Nothing is connected to everything; everything is connected\nto something.”[12](part0015.html#conft-12)\n\nFourth: _from molar to molecular_. Perhaps it’s not just a matter of seeing\nthe molar and molecular as two scales, one superimposed on the other, but of\nshifting the balance of perception much more to the molecular. For it is the\nmolecular scale which corresponds best to the labor point of view. If nature\nis that which resists labor, it does so in a granular way. The molar is the\nlanguage of management. It’s the dialogue of ideas, in which the experience of\nthose who organize labor substitutes for the experience of those whose labor\norganizes the material world directly.\n\nFifth: _from human to inhuman_. The language of molar drama is usually\nreserved for human subjects, even if they are collective ones, or for a drama\nof Man against Nature, or of Man against the Gods. While in Guattari’s hands\nthe idea of the molecular is often just a metaphor, it is one that could\nindeed extend all the way to the molecular scale of organization. We lack a\nlanguage for our complicity with anonymous materials, and their complicity\nwith each other.[13](part0015.html#conft-13) Attention could better be focused\non the inhuman apparatus via which the sensation of the nonhuman world is\nmediated.\n\nSixth: _from superstructure to base_. It was convenient for Marxists trained\nin the humanities to take their professional specialization to be the source\nof a basic metaphor, and to imagine the superstructure as autonomous or even\nas leading some “cultural revolution” independently or in parallel to the\nstruggles of labor at the base. That was before the infrastructure of\nintellectual life itself started to change beyond all recognition. In the\ntwenty-first century, even academic labor is becoming as precarious, as\ndigitized, as algorithmic as any other. And if that infrastructure is\nchanging, then others probably are too, and the whole question of what now\nconstitutes an infrastructure has to be revisited.[14](part0015.html#conft-14)\n\nSeven: _from genteel to vulgar_. For a long time it was obligatory to say that\none’s critical method, whatever it was, had nothing to do with _vulgar\nMarxism_.[15](part0015.html#conft-15) But now perhaps what we need is a\npungent dose of vulgarity. The vulgar, after all, is the common, the ordinary,\nthe multitudinous, the abundant, the coarse, and the indecent. All of which,\nto my mind, are, if not good things, then not bad things, and certainly\npertinent things. This is the lesson I retain from party school.\n\nVulgar Marxism is usually taken, among other things, to mean a rather\nsimplistic model of how the economic base “determines” the political and\ncultural superstructure. Its basic metaphors are either determinist,\neconomistic, mechanical, or evolutionary. Curiously, these basic metaphors did\nactually come from the more advanced forms of labor and science of their time.\nA vulgar Marxism for today might look to the analogous sources of our own\ntime.\n\nWhat we might call by contrast a _genteel Marxism_ insists on the relative—if\nnot absolute—autonomy of the cultural and political\nsuperstructure.[16](part0015.html#conft-16) And when it comes to the\ninfrastructure, it privileges the _relations_ of production over the _forces_\nof production. The relations of production are assumed to be described in\nessence by Marx, even if their phenomenal form changes from time to time. The\nqualitative breaks between different forces of production, from steam and\nsteel to oil and aluminum to silicon and solar, get little or no attention.\n\nThis mode of production—is it still even capitalist or something\nworse?[17](part0015.html#conft-17) It goes on and on as if there were no\nlimit. It is as if the “real” Platonic form that was capital had detached\nitself from appearances, from the hard matter of everyday life, and revealed\ntheir falsity. These worldly things, this whole Earth, falls short of the one\nthat capital imagines as its plaything. It has commanded already, and in\nadvance, more Earths than this one.\n\nThere is not enough base for its gleaming superstructures, not even if capital\nwere to annex Mars as well. A latter-day Platonov might notice that it is in\nthe imagination of _capital_ that the superstructures are all that matter.\nFrom the point of view of labor, which lies beneath it and provides the\nsurplus on which it feeds, no amount of effort could ever dig a pit big enough\nto found its vaulting ambitions.\n\nBut let’s not depress ourselves too much. Rather, let’s ask: how might the\nsurplus of time, of information, of life itself, be organized differently?\nThat might be a task for a no longer quite so hypocritical theory. There might\nstill be a role for the things theory traditionally teaches, such as the arts\nof reading, even if a more constructive rather than suspicious mode of reading\nmight be what the times require, and as a way to read a different kind of\ntext.[18](part0015.html#conft-18) Let’s use the time and information and\neveryday life still available to us to begin the task, quietly but in good\ncheer, of thinking otherwise, of working and experimenting. Let’s begin with a\nclose (or close enough) reading of texts that come like stray artifacts,\nextracted from Voschev’s bag.\n\nIt is time to leave the twenty-first century. The metabolic rift that wakes\nfrom the Carbon Liberation Front is not the only challenge to the biosphere.\nIt is more enveloping than the comrades at the Trade Union Environment Centre\ncould have imagined. The term Anthropocene, as taken up by Paul Crutzen and\nothers in the earth sciences, splices two roots together, _anthropos_ and\n_kainos_. Anthropos: that with the face of “man,” that which looks up. Kainos:\nthat which is not just a new unit of time but a new quality or form. What\nwould this mean to Bogdanov? He would refuse the authoritarian causality\nlurking in anthropos, that residue of the sky-God, and insist instead on\nmaking it mean collective labor. The kainos of labor in the twenty-first\ncentury is labor as intra-action, entanglement, the tragedy of the totality.\n\nAs someone who does texts rather than things, I am tempted to reject the term\nAnthropocene. Naming things ought to be the prerogative of us professional\nwordsmiths. Why accept a name some scientists came up with? And can’t we have\na more aspirational name? I want a name for what the kainos ought to be, not\nwhat it is.[19](part0015.html#conft-19) And in any case, it’s too\nanthropocentric. All of the interesting and useful movements in the humanities\nsince the late twentieth century have critiqued and dissented from the\ntheologies of the human.\n\nBut then I wonder what the comrades at the Trade Union Environment Centre\nmight have thought of it. Most of them were what Bogdanov called technical\nworkers. They had a bit of that idealism of the young Platonov, the idea that\nengineering was about making a better world through applying physics to\nmaterials, tools to tasks. They were struggling for a sense of a good\ntechnology.[20](part0015.html#conft-20) I imagine that for them the\nAnthropocene would have been something of a shock, in that it introduces the\neffects of labor into the situation in advance. What labor confronts is not\njust nature pristine, but nature always and already worked-over by labor. It’s\nactually already there in Platonov, if you look. When work stops in Chevengur,\na strange Anthropocene nature emerges, the grasses working out their own\nproportions—nature _after_ labor.\n\nThe anthropos in Anthropocene might do unexpected work for those trained in\nthe sciences or technical fields. Perhaps it is kainos that could be usefully\nconfusing for humanists, social scientists, or for those few of us who remain\nwho were trained at party school. What might it mean to think the\nqualitatively new, but where what is new is not defined by the communist\nhorizon? It is striking how much even the anti-communists of the Cold War era\ntook the model of a new kainos, against which any other had to be thought, to\nbe “communism.” Their neoliberal successors too.\n\nThis kainos, whether thought in, against, or after the communist horizon, is\nusually thought as a new _social_ relation. To the extent that it is thought\nas a relation to nature, it is as a victory that made Platonovian struggles in\nand against nature obsolete. The Anthropocene, by contrast, calls for thinking\nsomething that is not even defeat. Nonhuman kainos is then as provocative a\nthing to think for those whose training is all about organizing the human as\nanthropos is for those whose training is in organizing the nonhuman.\n\nOr such might be a way to make the most of something Bogdanov would surely\nhave appreciated: that new experiences often have to be thought within the\nbasic metaphors that already exist. Anthropocene it is, then. For now. A bad\nname for a bad time, thus not unfit. Haraway: “We need another figure, a\nthousand names of something else, to erupt out of the Anthropocene into\nanother, big enough story.”[21](part0015.html#conft-21) It’s a task not just\nof naming, but of doing, of making new kinds of labor for a new kind of\nnature.\n\nThere is still some low theory work to do, to transmit the metaphor of the\nAnthropocene between domains, but in that process, those labor processes will\nchange it. Rather than “interrogate” Crutzen’s Anthropocene—and where did\n_that_ metaphor come from?—perhaps it is better to see it as what it is: a\nbrilliant hack. The Anthropocene introduces the labor point of view—in the\nbroadest possible sense—into _geology_. Perhaps the challenge is then to find\nanalogous but different ways to hack other specialized domains of knowledge,\nto orient them to the situation and the tasks at hand.\n\nLet’s invent new metaphors! Personally, I like the _#misanthropocene_ , but\ndon’t expect it to catch on. Jason Moore prefers the _Capitalocene_ , Jussi\nParikka the _Anthrobscene_. Kate Raworth suggests _Manthropocene_ , given the\ngender make-up of the Anthropocene Working Group considering it as a name for\na geological era. Donna Haraway offers to name it the _Chthulucene_ , a more\nchthonic version of Cthulhu, the octopoid monster of H. P. Lovecraft’s weird\nstories. “Chthulucene does not close in on itself; it does not round off; its\ncontact zones are ubiquitous and continuously spin out loopy\ntendrils.”[22](part0015.html#conft-22)\n\nHaraway notes the strikingly parallel evolution of new metaphorical tools in\n_both_ humanities and biologies, where competitive individualism is no longer\na given. In Bogdanovite terms, perhaps it is because in both domains,\nproducing knowledge got strangely complex, collaborative, and mediated by\napparatuses. A new breed of basic metaphor is at least partly at work and in\nplay, one which in the biologies could be described as a “multi-species\nbecoming-with.”\n\nHaraway wants to both “justify and trouble” the language of the Anthropocene.\nAs Edwards does with climate science, she insists on the embeddedness in an\ninfrastructure that makes the global appear as a work-object to those natural\nscientists for whom the Anthropocene makes sense as a metaphor. She points to\nthe limits of its basic metaphors, which still think one-sidedly of\ncompetition between populations or genes, where success equals reproduction.\nMore symbiotic—dare we say comradely?—kinds of life hardly figure in such\nmetaphors. But perhaps, as Haraway says, “we are all lichens now”—cyborg\nlichens.[23](part0015.html#conft-23)\n\nAfter Robinson, the task is not debating names or trading stories, but making\ncomradely alliances. Is not Crutzen one of those curious scientist-\nintellectuals that Robinson’s fiction trains us to look out for? Crutzen and\nhis colleagues in the earth sciences have flagged something that needs to\nshape the agenda for knowledge, culture, and organization. For those of us\nseeking to respond from the left, I think the authors presented in _Molecular\nRed_ offer some of the best ways of _processing_ that information. Bogdanov\nand Platonov would not really be surprised by the Anthropocene. They were\nvulgar enough to think aspects of it already.\n\nSo let’s pop the following tools into the dillybag for future use:\n\nSomething like an _empirio-monism_ has its uses, because it is a way of doing\ntheory that directs the tendency to spin out webs of metaphoric language to\nthe task at hand. It steers the language arts toward agendas arising out of\nworking processes, including those of sciences. It is agnostic about which\nmetaphors best explain the real, but it sees all of them as substitutions\nwhich derive from the forms of labor and apparatus of the time.\n\nSomething like _proletkult_ has its uses, as the project for the self-\norganization of the labor point of view. It filters research into past culture\nand knowledge through the organizational needs of the present. Those needs put\npressure on the traditional category of labor, opening it toward feminist\nstandpoints, not to mention our queer cyborg entanglements.\n\nSomething like a tektology has its uses, as a way of coordinating labor other\nthan through exchange or hierarchy, or the new infrastructure of corporatized\n“networks.” It communicates between labor processes poetically and\nqualitatively. It is a training of the metaphoric wiliness of language toward\nparticular applications which correspond to and with advances in labor\ntechnique.\n\nLastly, something like the _utopia_ of _Red Star_ has its uses, in motivating\nthose working in separate fields to think beyond the fetishistic habits of the\nlocal and toward comradely goals. In the absence of a single counter-hegemonic\nideology, perhaps something like a meta-utopia might be more useful, and more\nfun. Meta-utopia offers not so much an imaginary solution to real problems as\na real problematizing of how to navigate the differences between the imaginal\nthat corresponds to each particular labor points of\nview.[24](part0015.html#conft-24)\n\nAnd so, to conclude with the slogan with which we began. It might be the\nslogan of a Cyborg International. One which already possesses in imagination\nthe means and the will to undo the workings of the Anthropocene. One with\nnothing for it but to build the new living world within the ruins of the old\none. We all know this civilization can’t last. Let’s make another.\n\nWORKINGS OF THE WORLD UNTIE!

The story of how cancer cell\ntissue from Lacks’s body became the basis for a whole biomedical industry,\nfrom which her descendents never benefited, and about which they did not even\nknow, is emblematic of what Melinda Cooper calls surplus life, and the\nextraction of value from it, more than Bogdanov’s more utopian idea about what\nPlatonov would call “shared life.” See Melinda Cooper, _Life as Surplus:\nBiotechnology and Capitalism in the Neoliberal Era_ , Seattle, WA: University\nof Washington Press, 2008.\n\n[22](part0009.html#ch1ft_22)Bogdanov, _Red Star_ , p. 65.\n\n[23](part0009.html#ch1ft_23)See Mark Poster, _The Mode of Information_ ,\nCambridge: Polity, 1990; Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell, _Towards a New\nSocialism_ , London: Coronet Books, 1993; Nick Dyer-Witheford, _Cyber-Marx:\nCycles and Circuits of Struggle in High Technology Capitalism_ , Champaign,\nIL: University of Illinois Press, 1999; Eden Medina, _Cybernetic\nRevolutionaries: Technology and Politics in Allende’s Chile_ , Cambridge, MA:\nMIT Press, 2011.\n\n[24](part0009.html#ch1ft_24)Bogdanov, _Red Star_ , p. 79. See H. G. Wells, _A\nModern Utopia_ , London: Penguin Modern Classics, 2005, p. 11. There is of\ncourse a strong tradition of science fiction writing in Russia, utopian and\notherwise, which arose even before its more metropolitan counterparts.

There Sartre uses the example of the cutting of forests in China as\na kind of counter-finality. The desired finality of increasing arable land\nresults in the counter-finality of flooding and erosion. But Sartre sees this\nas a contradiction between individual and group praxis, whereas for Bogdanov\ndeforestation is a problem of collective labor. Nevertheless Sartre’s concepts\nof counter-finality and the practico-inert seem promising keys to thinking the\nera of climate change.\n\n[26](part0009.html#ch1ft_26)Eduard Brückner, _The Sources and Consequences of\nClimate Change and Climate Variability_ , ed.

Bogdanov borrows the term tektology from Ernst\nHaeckel, the German follower of Darwin. See Robert Richards, _The Tragic Sense\nof Life: Ernst Haeckel and the Struggle Over Evolutionary Thought_ , Chicago,\nIL: University of Chicago Press, 2009, for a vigorous defense of Haeckel. In\nHaeckel’s work, tektology concerns the question of what constitutes an\nindividual organism—a non-obvious question in certain species he studied, such\nas sponges. Haeckel’s monism, descended from that of Goethe, was a strong\ninfluence on Bogdanov.\n\n[30](part0009.html#ch1ft_30)See Paul N.

V. A. Barazov and I. I.\nSkvortsov-Stepanov retranslated _Capital_ under Bogdanov’s supervision between\n1907 and 1910, after Bogdanov took over the job from Lenin.

Bogdanov derives the term\n“worldview” from Dilthey, although his understanding of their origins and\npurpose is quite different. Bogdanov is mentioned in Karl Mannheim, _Ideology\nand Utopia: An Introduction to the Sociology of Knowledge_ , Orlando, FL:\nHarcourt, 1955, p. 331, as a forerunner to the sociology of knowledge, most\nlikely for his organizational theory of worldviews.\n\n[39](part0009.html#ch1ft_39)Bogdanov, _The Philosophy of Living Experience_ ,\nms, pp. 9–10.\n\n[40](part0009.html#ch1ft_40)Ibid., p. 12.\n\n[41](part0009.html#ch1ft_41)Bogdanov adopted the concept of the basic metaphor\nfrom the philologist and Sanskrit scholar Max Müller.

The discussion there concerns whether tektology is a theory or a science,\nwhereas I maintain that what is essential to it is neither. Tektology is a\ncollaborative poetic method of generating theories and coordinating their\nscientific verification or refutation.\n\n[68](part0009.html#ch1ft_68)Cited in Jensen, _Beyond Marx and Mach_ , p. 133.\nBogdanov can usefully be compared here to Alfred Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual\nand Manual Labor_ , London: Macmillan, 1983.\n\n[69](part0009.html#ch1ft_69)See Edwards, _A Vast Machine_ , discussed further\nin Part II. In some ways Bogdanov anticipates Bruno Latour, but in one way\nnot: Bogdanov would not identify modernity with reason, but with labor. If,\nfor Latour, we have never been modern in that the network of relations even in\nscience does not conform to the model of reason, then for Bogdanov we have\nbeen modern since the nineteenth century, in that labor is organized pretty\nmuch as Marx describes it, via the wage relation. There is an ethnographic\ndimension to Bogdanov, in that he does not measure historical worldviews via\nan imaginary external standard of reason. But he does see a cumulative process\nvia which worldviews of more and more generality succeed each other in time.\n\n[70](part0009.html#ch1ft_70)Cited in Jensen, _Beyond Marx and Mach_ , p. 136.\n\n[71](part0009.html#ch1ft_71)For a recent example, see Ian Bogost, _Unit\nOperations_ , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006, pp. 38–43, where Bogost writes\nabout the idea of “object oriented ontology” in programming. “To negotiate the\nconflicting demands of protecting proprietary symbolic code and leasing that\ncode to thousands of independent developers, the notion of component objects\nwas born.” Or in other words, while the application of object oriented\nontology (OOO) to the design of software is a matter of protecting\nintellectual property, when OOO becomes a philosophical movement premised on\nthe notion that objects withdraw, not only from subjects but from each other,\nthe roots of this metaphor in the current organization of property relations\nis quietly forgotten. But it does not then seem unreasonable to interpret OOO\nas a philosophy in which objects protect their intellectual property from each\nother. This argument generally elicits puzzlement or fury from the advocates\nof OOO, who, regardless of their merits as original thinkers and allies in the\novercoming of a rather stale phenomenology, have simply forgotten how to debug\ntheir own code when it comes to its implication in the particular\norganizational forms of the times. Which is something of a shortcoming in a\nmovement with rather cosmic aspirations.\n\n[72](part0009.html#ch1ft_72)Cited in Jensen, _Beyond Marx and Mach_ , p. 151.\n\n[73](part0009.html#ch1ft_73)See the classic studies by David Noble, _America\nBy Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism_ , New\nYork: Alfred Knopf, 1977; and _The Forces of Production: A Social History of\nIndustrial Automation_ , Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986.\n\n[74](part0009.html#ch1ft_74)Marcel van der Linden, _Western Marxism and the\nSoviet Union: A Survey of Critical Theories and Debates Since 1917_ , Chicago,\nIL: Haymarket Books, 2009.

The story is a compact demonstration of some\naspects of Platonov’s method. It is constructed around a pun between the\nRussian words for utopia and drowning, and around two appearances of the\nfigure of the “hole.” The canal fails when a hole is dug too deep; the\nengineer is sodomized by his executioner before his death. Like Raymond\nRoussel, Platonov often seems to construct texts “structurally,” out of\nhomophones or homologies of figure. See Raymond Roussel, _How I Wrote Certain\nof My Books_ , Boston: Exact Change, 2005. Not the least interest of Platonov\nis the way he combines _both_ documentary realism and extremes of formalist\nmethod.\n\n[18](part0010.html#ch2ft_18)E. P. Thompson coined the phrase. See “History\nfrom Below,” _Times Literary Supplement_ , April 7, 1966, pp. 279–80. History\nfrom below the below is how I see the work of Thompson’s former student, Peter\nLinebaugh, such as _The London Hanged_ , London: Verso, 2006. Linebaugh traces\nthe imposition of new forms of wage and property relation on the\n(sub)proletarian body by force.\n\n[19](part0010.html#ch2ft_19)See Davis, _Planet of Slums_. Platonov’s\ncharacters are often only marginally connected to industrialization.\nDevelopment happens elsewhere, off in the distance. As Davis shows, this is\nnow a majority experience.\n\n[20](part0010.html#ch2ft_20)T. J. Clark mentions Platonov in passing as one of\nthe authors he would recruit to his version of a left politics in a tragic\nkey, but Clark’s tragedy falls short of the tragedy of the totality which for\nBogdanov would characterize a proletarian culture.

On reading\nPlatonov’s major works as a great series of Marxist historical novels, one\ncannot but quote, in a sly way, the concluding remarks from 1937 of Georg\nLukács, _The Historical Novel_ , Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1983,\np. 350: “The historical novel of our time … must above all negate, radically\nand sharply, its immediate predecessor and eradicate the latter’s traditions\nfrom its own work. The necessary approximation to the classical type of\nhistorical novel which occurs in this connection will … by no means take the\nform of a simple renaissance, a simple affirmation of these classical\ntraditions, but, if one will allow me this phrase from Hegel’s terminology, a\nrenewal in the form of the negation of the negation.” It may also be worth\nnoting that many of Platonov’s reviews and even some stories were published in\na journal for which Lukács was on the editorial board.\n\n[22](part0010.html#ch2ft_22)See Slavoj Žižek, _Repeating Lenin_ , Zagreb:\nArkzin, 2001, for a rather striking reading of Lenin’s “leap of faith.”\n\n[23](part0010.html#ch2ft_23)Platonov, _Chevengur_ , p. 27.\n\n[24](part0010.html#ch2ft_24)Ibid., p. 30.

Žižek thinks this gnostic-materialist current of the\nrevolution is somehow distinct from Bolshevism proper, as well as being what\n“mature Stalinism,” as he calls it, reacts against. But by Žižek’s own\naccount, Lenin participates in a mystic leap beyond material constraints. What\nis absent from Žižek’s brief remarks on Platonov is an awareness not so much\nof his gnostic as of his materialist sensibility, his relentless attention to\nthe tektological envelope of the body and its grim persistence against a\nresistant nature.\n\n[49](part0010.html#ch2ft_49)On the concentrated spectacle, see Debord,\n_Society of the Spectacle_ , s. 63–4.\n\n[50](part0010.html#ch2ft_50)Platonov, _Chevengur_ , p. 179.

See Morton,\n_Ecology Without Nature_. For Morton, “Nature” has too much history to\nfunction as a concept, and so he tries to rethink ecology without nature as\nreferent. After Bogdanov, I think there might be some use value in the\ndifferent ways in which nature as a concept is constructed out of different\nencounters with resistance by particular regimes of labor. Morton is also\nresistant to monism, imagining that it wishes away the problem of ecology, but\nas both Bogdanov and even more so Platonov show, a monism is no neat and tidy\nunity.\n\n[69](part0010.html#ch2ft_69)Platonov, _Chevengur_ , pp. 294–5. Serbinov is\ntroubled by a split between desire (meaning) and drive (passionate veins).\nOutside the purely psychoanalytic realm, the split between desire and drive is\ncentral to a whole line of thought that perhaps begins with Alexandre Kojève’s\n_Introduction to the Reading of Hegel_. To lapse “back” from desire to drive\nis to fall out of history. This reading is still alive and well in Bernard\nStiegler. But perhaps one can go the other way, as is suggested by Hiroki\nAzuma, _Otaku: Japan’s Database Animals_ , Minneapolis, MN: University of\nMinnesota Press, 2009. A richer and more interesting historical thought may\nemerge out of taking material drives seriously rather than the more\ntheological “desires,” or rather refusing the whole dualism—and hence I prefer\nthe term appetites.\n\n[70](part0010.html#ch2ft_70)See Ivan Chtcheglov, “Formulary for a New\nUrbanism,” in Tom McDonough, _Situationists and the City_ , London: Verso,\n2009, pp. 32–41.

In light of\nthose two works, nothing in _Foundation Pit_ about the forced collectivization\nseems at all surreal or fantastic.\n\n[74](part0010.html#ch2ft_74)The “production” novel is a sort of prototype for\nsocialist realism, a bit too bogged down in statistics and not yet fully\ninformed by the communist horizon. Key texts include certain editions of\nFyodor Gladkov’s _Cement_. Pilniak’s _Mahogany_ may also be a détournement of\n_Chevengur_ , and _Foundation Pit_ of Pilniak’s revision of _Mahogany_ along\nsocialist realist lines.

While for Bogost the\nkipple to be found littering the landscape of New Mexico has a certain\naesthetic dimension; for Platonov, the leaf and other detritus work in a more\ncritical way, as tokens of a tektology always falling short of the\norganization of the material world.

A cruel\noptimism is a misrecognition of a promise as an achievement, where an object\ncomes to stand for a whole world, and the loss of that object would mean the\nloss of the whole world. The cruelty lies in the pleasure deriving solely from\nmaintaining a relation to the object when the object itself is not\npleasurable.

On bare life, see Giorgio Agamben,\n_Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life_ , Stanford, CA: Stanford\nUniversity Press, 1998. In Agamben, the emphasis is on the sovereign power to\ndecide what counts as political life and what is bare life, outside the law.\nIn Platonov, it is all the other way around. It is bare life in the sense of\nshared life and its appetites that is the base upon which the superstructures\nof a legally protected life might be based. _Soul_ is among other things about\nthe material basis of political life. Platonov’s question is about how\nsecuring the material basis of the appetites might found an everyday life not\nsubject to the sovereign’s arbitrary violence.\n\n[149](part0010.html#ch2ft_149)Platonov, _Soul_ , p. 103.\n\n[150](part0010.html#ch2ft_150)Ibid., pp. 108, 112.\n\n[151](part0010.html#ch2ft_151)Ibid., p. 121. Here Platonov seems to me a\nuseful corrective to the somewhat euphoric revival of the figure of\n“communism” by younger theorists. While I support their critique of the\napolitical and cultural turns in intellectual life, for me Platonov—who never\nabandoned his “fidelity” to it—nevertheless offers a much richer and\nhistorical sense of what a praxis might still be, as a “more interesting\ngrief.” See Bruno Bosteels, _The Actuality of Communism_ , London: Verso,\n2011; Jodi Dean, _The Communist Horizon_ , London: Verso, 2012. The latter\ntitle immediately recalls Platonov’s peasant, who accuses the party of taking\nboth land and sky, and leaving the peasant _nothing but_ the horizon.\n\n[152](part0010.html#ch2ft_152)Platonov, _Soul_ , p. 127.

Marx perhaps never quite\noutgrew the pre-scientific notion of species-being he inherited from\nFeuerbach, but one can rethink the category of species-being in a non-\nessential way.

Here Michaels attacks those, including Haraway, who he thinks are\ncommitted to “deconstructive” theses of the materiality of the signifier, and\n(same thing for him) the “primacy of the subject.” He thinks there can be no\nconflicts of interpretation among subjects taken to speak incommensurable\nlanguages. But this is where Robinson’s meta-utopia is an interesting\n“laboratory,” for while it is populated by very different and incommensurable\npoints of view, only in this case derived as much from their labors as their\n“subject positions,” it is nevertheless possible to at least narrate the\nnegotiation of their positions, which are constituted in relation to each\nother in part by practices of governance but also by verifiable knowledge\nprocedures. It is possible, for example, to measure a volume of water or a\nquantity of off-gassing. It is revealing that Michaels’s essay focuses on the\nnames of Mars, and not on any of the other ways in which its characters know\nand measure and labor in and on and with it.\n\n[88](part0013.html#ch4ft_88)Robinson, _Blue Mars_ , p. 172.

Where the German social democrats had considered philosophy\nunimportant on principle, Lenin had only maintained that attitude for tactical\nreasons. But Korsch considers the question of Bogdanov settled, and contrary\nto his own strictures on philosophical rigor, does not return to investigate.\nAnd so things have stood, more or less, for almost a century. See Karl Korsch,\n_Marxism and Philosophy_ , London: Verso, 2013, p. 35. Lukács, in _History and\nClass Consciousness_ , opens by marking off the distance between a\nrevolutionary theory of the subject-object correlation from the “Machists,”\nfor whom reality follows natural laws that can’t be grasped or modified by\nhuman action (p. 4). At this point in his career Lukács’ strictures against\nscience seem to rest on the example of David Ricardo! Of all the “canonic”\nwriters in the Western Marxist tradition, only Althusser offers much of an\nengagement. See Louis Althusser, _Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of\nthe Scientists_ , London: Verso, 2011. After modern physics put paid to the\nmaterialist metaphysics inherited from the eighteenth century, scientific\n“savants” produced rival theories such as Mach’s, which “seduced” even\nqualified philosophers such as Bogdanov. It is hard to escape the notion that\nfor Althusser, just as workers need the party of professional revolutionaries\nto tell them what to do, scientists need the academy of professional\nphilosophers to tell them how to think.\n\n[6](part0014.html#conft_6)See Razmig Keucheyan, _Left Hemisphere: Mapping\nContemporary Theory_ , London: Verso, 2013.

The political superstructure became the object of\npolitical philosophy, the ideological superstructure became the province of\nsemiotics.

The Human-Technology Relationship_ , Slough:\nLangley Technical Services, 1980; and Hilary Wainwright and David Elliot, _The\nLucas Plan_ , London: Allison & Busby, 1982, which in retrospect seems\nperfectly congruent with proletkult.\n\n[21](part0014.html#conft_21)Haraway, “Staying With the Trouble: Paper for\nIsabelle Stengers,” p. 26.\n\n[22](part0014.html#conft_22)See Jason Moore, “The Capitalocene,” June 2014, at\n[www.jasonmoore.com](http://www.jasonmoore.com); Jussi Parikka, _The\nAnthrobscene_ , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014. For\n“Manthropocene” see Andrew Revkin, “Never Mind the Anthropocene,” _New York\nTimes_ , October 17, 2014. For Cthulhucene, see Haraway, “Staying With the\nTrouble.” Haraway is less interested in Lovecraft than in the fact that a\nspider native to her part of California is named after Cthulhu. I borrow\n#misanthropocene from Joshua Clover and Julianna Spahr, _#misanthropocene: 24\nTheses_ , Commune Editions, 2014, at <http://communeeditions.com>, although\nlike all such terms it appears to have been invented spontaneously several\ntimes.\n\n[23](part0014.html#conft_23)Haraway attributes this slogan to Scott Gilbert et\nal., “A Symbiotic View of Life,” _Quarterly Review of Biology_ , Vol. 87, No.\n4, 2012. The classic statement of symbiosis as a basic metaphor is Lynn\nMargulis, _Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution_ , New York: Basic Books,\n1998.\n\n[24](part0014.html#conft_24)See Chiara Bottici, _Imaginal Politics: Images\nBeyond Imagination and the Imaginary_ , New York: Columbia University Press,\n2014.

Freedom is felt when\npassing from one way of living to another – until this too turns out to be a\nform of coercion. Then, liberation gives way to renewed subjugation. Such is\nthe destiny of the _subject_ ; literally, the ‘one who has been cast down’.\n\nToday, we do not deem ourselves subjugated _subjects_ , but rather _projects_\n: always refashioning and reinventing ourselves. A sense of freedom attends\npassing from the state of subject to that of project. All the same, this\nprojection amounts to a form of compulsion and constraint – indeed, to a _more\nefficient kind of subjectivation and subjugation_. As a project deeming itself\nfree of external and alien limitations, the _I_ is now subjugating itself to\ninternal limitations and self-constraints, which are taking the form of\ncompulsive achievement and optimization.\n\nWe are living in a particular phase of history: freedom itself is bringing\nforth compulsion and constraint. The freedom of _Can_ generates even more\ncoercion than the disciplinarian _Should_ , which issues commandments and\nprohibitions. _Should_ has a limit. In contrast, _Can_ has none. Thus, the\ncompulsion entailed by _Can_ is unlimited. And so we find ourselves in a\nparadoxical situation. Technically, freedom means the opposite of coercion and\ncompulsion. Being free means being free from constraint. But now freedom\nitself, which is supposed to be the opposite of constraint, is producing\ncoercion. Psychic maladies such as depression and burnout express a profound\ncrisis of freedom. They represent pathological signs that freedom is now\nswitching over into manifold forms of compulsion.\n\nAlthough the achievement-subject deems itself free, in reality it is a slave.\nIn so far as it willingly exploits itself without a master, it is an _absolute\nslave_. There is no master forcing the achievement-subject to work. Yet all\nthe same, it is absolutizing _bare life_ and _labour_. Bare life and labour\nform two sides of the same coin. Health represents the ideal of bare life.\nToday’s neoliberal slave lacks the sovereignty – indeed, the freedom – of the\nmaster who, according to Hegel’s dialectic, performs no labour at all and\n_only enjoys_. For Hegel, the _sovereignty of the master_ derives from his\nrising above bare life and risking death itself in the process. Such _excess_\n– living and enjoying beyond measure – is alien to the slave, who worries only\nabout bare life. But counter to what Hegel assumed, labouring does not make\nthe slave free. The slave remains enslaved to labour. Now, the slave is\nforcing the master to work too. Today’s dialectic of master and slave means\nthe totalization of labour.\n\nAs the entrepreneur of its own self, the neoliberal subject has no capacity\nfor relationships with others that might be _free of purpose_. Nor do\nentrepreneurs know what purpose-free friendship would even look like.\nOriginally, being free meant _being among friends_. ‘Freedom’ and ‘friendship’\nhave the same root in Indo-European languages. Fundamentally, freedom\nsignifies a _relationship_. A real feeling of freedom occurs only in a\nfruitful relationship – when being with others brings happiness. But today’s\nneoliberal regime leads to utter isolation; as such, it does not really free\nus at all. Accordingly, the question now is whether we need to redefine\nfreedom – to reinvent it – in order to escape from the fatal dialectic that is\nchanging freedom into coercion.\n\nNeoliberalism represents a highly efficient, indeed an intelligent, system for\nexploiting freedom. Everything that belongs to practices and expressive forms\nof liberty – emotion, play and communication – comes to be exploited. It is\ninefficient to exploit people against their will. Allo-exploitation yields\nscant returns. Only when freedom is exploited are returns maximized.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Marx also defines freedom in terms of a\nsuccessful relationship to others: ‘Only in community [with others does each]\nindividual [have] the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; only\nin the community, therefore, is personal freedom\npossible.’[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch1-fn-1) From this perspective, being free means\nnothing other than _self-realization with others_. Freedom is synonymous with\na working community (i.e., a successful one).\n\nFor Marx, individual freedom represents a ruse – a trick of capital. ‘Free\ncompetition’, which is based on the idea of individual freedom, simply amounts\nto the ‘relation of capital to itself as another capital, i.e., the real\nconduct of capital as capital’.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch1-fn-2) Capital reproduces\nby entering into relations with itself as another form of Capital: through\nfree competition. It copulates with the Other of itself by way of individual\nfreedom. Capital grows inasmuch as people engage in free competition. Hereby,\nindividual freedom amounts to servitude inasmuch as Capital lays hold of it\nand uses it for its own propagation. That is, Capital exploits individual\nfreedom in order to breed: ‘It is not the individuals who are set free by free\ncompetition; it is, rather, capital which is set\nfree.’[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch1-fn-3)\n\nThe _freedom of Capital_ achieves self-realization by way of individual\nfreedom. In the process, individuals degrade into the genital organs of\nCapital. Individual freedom lends it an ‘automatic’ subjectivity of its own,\nwhich spurs it to reproduce actively. In this way, Capital continuously\n‘brings forth living offspring’.[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch1-fn-4) Today, individual\nfreedom is taking on excessive forms; ultimately, this amounts to nothing\nother than the _excess of Capital itself_.\n\n**The Dictatorship of Capital**\n\nAt a certain level of development, according to Marx, the forces of production\n(human labour, modes of work and the material means available) come into\nconflict with the dominant relations of production (conditions of ownership\nand domination). Contradiction arises because the forces of production never\nstop evolving. Thus, industrialization brings forth new forces of production\nthat come into conflict with structures of ownership and government that still\nresemble feudal conditions. In turn, this contradiction entails social crises:\npushes to change the relations of production. For Marx, the contradiction is\nto be eliminated by way of the proletariat’s struggle against the bourgeoisie\n– which will bring forth a communist social order.\n\nBut counter to what Marx assumed, communist revolution cannot resolve the\ncontradiction between forces of production and relations of production. The\ncontradiction admits no dialectical _Aufhebung_. Capitalism can always escape\ninto the future precisely because it harbours permanent and inherent\ncontradiction. Accordingly, industrial capitalism has now _mutated_ into\nneoliberalism and financial capitalism, which are implementing a post-\nindustrial, immaterial mode of production – instead of turning into communism.\n\nAs a mutant form of capitalism, neoliberalism transforms workers into\n_entrepreneurs_. It is not communist revolution that is now abolishing the\nallo-exploited working class – instead, neoliberalism is in the course of\ndoing so. Today, everyone is an _auto-exploiting labourer in his or her own\nenterprise_. People are now master and slave in one. Even class struggle has\ntransformed into an _inner struggle against oneself_.\n\nThe cooperative ‘Multitude’ that Antonio Negri has exalted as the post-Marxist\nsuccessor to the ‘proletariat’ does not describe the contemporary mode of\nproduction. Rather, conditions are defined by the _solitude_ of an\nentrepreneur who is isolated and self-combating and practises auto-\nexploitation voluntarily. As such, it is a mistake to believe that the\ncooperative ‘Multitude’ will overthrow the parasitic ‘Empire’ and bring forth\na communist social order. The Marxist scheme to which Negri adheres will prove\nto have been yet another illusion.\n\nIn fact, no proletariat exists under the neoliberal regime at all. There is no\nworking class being exploited by those who own the means of production. When\nproduction is immaterial, everyone already owns the means of production him-\nor herself. The neoliberal system is no longer a class system in the proper\nsense. It does not consist of classes that display mutual antagonism. This is\nwhat accounts for the system’s stability.\n\nToday, the distinction between proletariat and bourgeoisie no longer holds\neither. Literally, ‘proletarian’ means someone whose sole possessions are his\nor her children: self-production is restricted to biological reproduction. But\nnow the illusion prevails that every person – as a project free to fashion\nhim- or herself at will – is capable of _unlimited self-production_. This\nmeans that a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ is structurally impossible.\nToday, the Dictatorship of Capital rules over everyone.\n\nThe neoliberal regime transforms allo-exploitation into auto-exploitation;\nthis process affects all ‘classes’. Such classless self-exploitation – which\nwas something utterly unknown to Marx – renders impossible any social\nrevolution based on the difference between the exploiters, on the one hand,\nand the exploited, on the other. Indeed, given the auto-exploiting\nachievement-subject’s isolation, no _political We_ is even possible that could\nrise up and undertake collective action.\n\nPeople who fail in the neoliberal achievement-society see themselves as\nresponsible for their lot and feel shame instead of questioning society or the\nsystem. Herein lies the particular intelligence defining the neoliberal\nregime: no resistance to the system can emerge in the first place. In\ncontrast, when allo-exploitation prevails, the exploited are still able to\nshow solidarity and unite against those who exploit them. Such is the logic on\nwhich Marx’s idea of a ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ is based. However,\nthis vision presupposes that relations of repression and domination hold. Now,\nunder the neoliberal regime of auto-exploitation, people are turning their\naggression _against themselves_. This auto-aggressivity means that the\nexploited are not inclined to revolution so much as depression.\n\nIn our world, we no longer work in order to satisfy our own needs. Instead, we\nwork for Capital. Capital generates needs of its own; mistakenly, we perceive\nthese needs as if they belonged to us. Capital therefore represents a new kind\nof _transcendence_ , which entails a new form of subjectivation. We are being\nexpelled from the sphere of lived immanence – where life relates to life\ninstead of subjugating itself to external ends.\n\nEmancipation from a transcendent order – that is, an order grounded in\nreligious premises – is the hallmark of modern politics. Only under modern\nconditions – when transcendental means of justification no longer possess any\nvalidity – is a genuine politics, the politicization of society as a whole,\nheld to be possible. Now, norms of action are supposed to be subject to\nnegotiation at every level: transcendence will yield to _discourse immanent to\nsociety itself_. Society, the reasoning goes, can construct itself anew,\npurely from within, on the basis of _immanent_ properties. However, such\nfreedom vanishes just as soon as Capital achieves the status of being a _new\ntranscendency_ – a _new master_. When this occurs, politics lapses into\nservitude again. It becomes the handmaiden of Capital.\n\n_Do we really want to be free?_ Didn’t we invent God so we wouldn’t have to be\nfree? Before God, we are all debtors: guilty (_schuldig_). But debt – guilt –\ndestroys freedom. Today, politicians appeal to high debt rates to explain that\ntheir freedom to act is massively restricted. Free from debt – that is, wholly\nfree – we would truly have to _act_. Perhaps we run up debts perpetually so we\nwon’t need to do so – that is, so we won’t need to be _free_ , or\n_responsible_. Don’t our debts prove that we don’t have the power to be free?\nCould it be that Capital is a _new God_ , making us guilty and debt-ridden\nagain? Walter Benjamin held that capitalism is a religion. As he put it,\ncapitalism represents the ‘first case of a cult that creates guilt, not\natonement’ (_der erste Fall eines nicht entsühnenden, sondern verschuldenden\nKultus_). Since there is no possibility of relieving debt and guilt, the state\nof unfreedom perpetuates itself: ‘A vast sense of guilt that is unable to find\nrelief seizes on the cult, not to atone for this guilt but to make it\nuniversal.’[5](20_Notes.xhtml#ch1-fn-5)\n\n**The Dictatorship of Transparency**\n\nInitially, the internet was celebrated as a medium of boundless liberty.\nMicrosoft’s early advertising slogan – ‘Where do you want to go today?’ –\nsuggested unlimited freedom and mobility on the web. As it turned out, such\neuphoria was an illusion. Today, unbounded freedom and communication are\nswitching over into total control and surveillance. More and more, social\nmedia resemble digital panoptica keeping watch over the social realm and\nexploiting it mercilessly. We had just freed ourselves from the disciplinary\npanopticon – then we threw ourselves into a new, and even more efficient,\npanopticon.\n\nJeremy Bentham’s panopticon isolated inmates from each other for disciplinary\npurposes and prevented them from interacting. In contrast, the occupants of\ntoday’s digital panopticon actively communicate with each other and willingly\nexpose themselves. That is, they _collaborate_ in the digital panopticon’s\noperations. Digital control society makes intensive use of freedom. This can\nonly occur thanks to voluntary self-illumination and self-exposure\n(_Selbstausleuchtung und Selbstentblößung_). Digital Big Brother _outsources_\noperations to inmates, as it were. Accordingly, data is not surrendered under\nduress so much as offered out of an inner need. That is why the digital\npanopticon proves so efficient.\n\nTransparency is demanded in the name of the freedom of information too. In\nreality, however, this amounts to nothing other than a _neoliberal\ndispositive_. It means turning everything inside out by force and transforming\nit into _information_. Under the immaterial mode of production that now\nprevails, more information and more communication mean more productivity,\nacceleration and growth. Information represents a positive value; inasmuch as\nit lacks interiority, it _can circulate independently, free from any and all\ncontext_. Accordingly, the circulation of information admits acceleration at\nwill – for purely arbitrary reasons.\n\nSecrets, foreignness and otherness represent impediments to unbounded\ncommunication. In the name of transparency, they are to be eliminated.\nCommunication goes faster when it is smoothed out – that is, when thresholds,\nwalls and gaps are removed. This also means stripping people of interiority,\nwhich blocks and slows down communication. However, such emptying-out of\npersons does not occur by violent means. Instead, it occurs as voluntary self-\nexposure. The negativity of otherness or foreignness is de-interiorized and\ntransformed into the positivity of communicable and consumable difference:\n‘diversity’. The dispositive of transparency effects utter exteriorization in\norder to accelerate the circulation of information and speed communication.\nUltimately, openness facilitates unrestricted communication – whereas\nclosedness, reserve and interiority obstruct it.\n\nThe dispositive of transparency has the further consequence of promoting total\nconformity. The economy of transparency seeks to suppress deviation. Total\nnetworking – total communication – already has a levelling effect per se. Its\neffect is conformity: it is as if _everyone were watching over everyone else_\n– even before intelligence agencies or secret services have stepped in to\nsupervise and steer. Invisible moderators smooth out communication and\ncalibrate it to what is generally understood and accepted. Such _primary,\nintrinsic_ surveillance proves much more problematic than the _secondary,\nextrinsic_ surveillance undertaken by secret services and spying agencies.\n\nNeoliberalism makes citizens into consumers. The freedom of the citizen yields\nto the passivity of the consumer. As consumers, today’s voters have no real\ninterest in politics – in actively shaping the community. They possess neither\nthe will nor the ability to participate in communal, political action. _They\nreact only passively_ to politics: grumbling and complaining, as consumers do\nabout a commodity or service they do not like. Politicians and parties follow\nthis logic of consumption too. They have to _‘deliver’_. In the process, they\nbecome nothing more than suppliers; their task is to satisfy voters who are\nconsumers or customers.\n\nThe _transparency_ demanded of politicians today is anything but a _political_\ndemand. Transparency is not called for in _political_ decision-making\nprocesses; no consumer is interested in that. Instead, and above all, the\nimperative of transparency serves to expose or unmask politicians, to make\nthem an item of scandal. The call for transparency presupposes occupying the\nposition of a shocked spectator. It is not voiced by engaged citizens so much\nas by passive onlookers. Participation now amounts to grievance and complaint.\nWith that, the society of transparency, inhabited by onlookers and consumers,\nhas given rise to a _spectator democracy_.\n\nAn essential component of freedom is informational self-determination. The\n1984 ruling on the census made by the German Federal Constitutional Court\nalready declared: ‘If citizens cannot know who knows what, when, and on what\noccasion about them, the right to informational self-determination is\nincompatible with social order and the legal order facilitating the\nsame.’[6](20_Notes.xhtml#ch1-fn-6) That said, this ruling was made at a time\nwhen people commonly believed they were facing the State as an instance of\ndomination, which wrested information from citizens against their will. Such a\ntime is long past. Today, we voluntarily expose ourselves without any external\nconstraint at all – without an edict commanding us to do so. Of our own free\nwill, we put any and all conceivable information about ourselves on the\ninternet, without having the slightest idea who knows what, when or on what\noccasion. This lack of control represents a crisis of freedom to be taken\nseriously. Indeed, given the data that people make available willy-nilly, the\nvery idea of protecting privacy (_Datenschutz_) is becoming obsolete.\n\nToday, we are entering the age of digital psychopolitics. It means passing\nfrom passive surveillance to active steering. As such, it is precipitating a\nfurther crisis of freedom: now, free will itself is at stake. Big Data is a\nhighly efficient psychopolitical instrument that makes it possible to achieve\ncomprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of social communication. This\nknowledge is knowledge for the sake of domination and control\n(_Herrschaftswissen_): it facilitates intervention in the psyche and enables\ninfluence to take place on a pre-reflexive level.\n\nFor human beings to be able to act freely, the future must be open. However,\nBig Data is making it possible to predict human behaviour. This means that the\nfuture is becoming calculable and controllable. Digital psychopolitics\ntransforms the negativity of freely made decisions into the _positivity of\nfactual states_ (_Sachverhalte_). Indeed, _persons_ are being positivized into\n_things_ , which can be quantified, measured and steered. Needless to say, no\n_thing_ can be free. But at the same time, things are _more transparent_ than\npersons. Big Data has announced the end of the _person_ who possesses free\nwill.\n\nEvery dispositive – every technology or technique of domination – brings forth\ncharacteristic devotional objects that are employed in order to subjugate.\nSuch objects _materialize_ and stabilize dominion. _Devotion_ and related\nwords mean ‘submission’, or ‘obedience’. Smartphones represent _digital_\ndevotion – indeed, they are the _devotional objects of the Digital_ , period.\nAs a subjectivation-apparatus, the smartphone works like a rosary – which,\nbecause of its ready availability, represents a handheld device too. Both the\nsmartphone and the rosary serve the purpose of self-monitoring and control.\nPower operates more effectively when it delegates surveillance to discrete\nindividuals. _Like_ is the digital _Amen_. When we click _Like_ , we are\nbowing down to the order of domination. The smartphone is not just an\neffective surveillance apparatus; it is also a mobile confessional. Facebook\nis the church – the global synagogue (literally, ‘assembly’) of the Digital.\n\n\n## [2.](05_Contents.xhtml#s2)\n\n## [Smart Power](05_Contents.xhtml#s2)\n\nPower commands highly different modes of appearance. Its most direct and\nimmediate form finds expression as the negation of freedom. This enables\npower-holders to impose their will against the will of those subject to power\n– by violence, if need be. However, power is not limited to breaking down\nresistance and forcing obedience. It need not take the form of coercion. Power\nthat relies on violence does not represent power of the highest order. The\nmere fact that another will manages to form and turn against the power-holder\nattests to the latter’s weakness. Wherever power does not come into view at\nall, it exists without question. The greater power is, the _more quietly_ it\nworks. It just _happens_ : it has no need to draw attention to itself.\n\nTo be sure, power can express itself as violence or repression. But it is not\n_based_ on force. Power need not exclude, prohibit or censor. Not does it\nstand opposed to freedom. Indeed, power can even use freedom to its own ends.\nOnly in its negative form does power manifest itself as a violence that says\n‘no’ by shattering the will and annulling freedom. Today, power is assuming\nincreasingly _permissive_ forms. In its permissivity – indeed, in its\n_friendliness_ – power is shedding its negativity and presenting itself as\nfreedom.\n\nDisciplinary power is still commanded by negativity. Its mode of articulation\nis _inhibitive_ , not _permissive_. Because it is negative, it does not\ndescribe the neoliberal regime – which beams forth in positivity. The\nneoliberal regime’s technology of power takes on subtle, supple and smart\nforms; thereby, it escapes all visibility. Now, the subjugated subject is not\neven aware of its own subjugation. The whole context of domination\n(_Herrschaftszusammenhang_) remains entirely hidden. Consequently, the subject\nthinks itself free.\n\nInasmuch as it expends a great deal of energy to force people into the\nstraightjacket of commandments and prohibitions, disciplinary power proves\ninefficient. A significantly more efficient technology of power makes sure\nthat people subordinate themselves to power relations _on their own_. Such a\ndynamic seeks to activate, motivate and optimize – not to inhibit or repress.\nIt proves so effective because it does not operate by means of forbidding and\ndepriving, but by pleasing and fulfilling. Instead of making people\n_compliant_ , it seeks to make them _dependent_.\n\nPower that is smart and friendly does not operate frontally – i.e., against\nthe will of those who are subject to it. Instead, it guides their will to its\nown benefit. It says ‘yes’ more often than ‘no’; it operates seductively, not\nrepressively. It seeks to call forth positive emotions and exploit them. It\n_leads astray_ instead of erecting obstacles. Instead of standing opposed to\nthe subject, smart and friendly power meets the subject halfway.\n\nSmart power cosies up to the psyche rather than disciplining it through\ncoercion or prohibitions. It does not impose silence. Rather, it is constantly\ncalling on us to confide, share and participate: to communicate our opinions,\nneeds, wishes and preferences – to tell all about our lives. _Friendly_ power\nproves _more powerful_ , as it were, than purely repressive power. It manages\nnot to be seen at all. Today’s crisis of freedom stems from the fact that the\noperative technology of power does not negate or repress freedom so much as\nexploit it. Free choice (_Wahl_) is eliminated to make way for a free\nselection (_Auswahl_) from among the items on offer.\n\nSmart power with a liberal, friendly appearance – power that stimulates and\nseduces – is more compelling than power that imposes, threatens and decrees.\nIts signal and seal is the _Like_ button. Now, people subjugate themselves to\ndomination by consuming and communicating – and they click _Like_ all the\nwhile. Neoliberalism is the _capitalism of ‘Like’_. It is fundamentally\ndifferent from nineteenth-century capitalism, which operated by means of\ndisciplinary constraints and prohibitions.\n\nSmart power reads and appraises our conscious and unconscious thoughts. It\nplaces its stock in voluntary self-organization and self-optimization. As\nsuch, it has no need to overcome resistance. Mastery of this sort requires no\ngreat expenditure of energy or violence. It simply _happens_. The capitalism\nof _Like_ should come with a warning label: _Protect me from what I want_.\n\n\n## [3.](05_Contents.xhtml#s3)\n\n## [The Mole and the Snake](05_Contents.xhtml#s3)\n\nDisciplinary society consists of settings and institutions of confinement. The\nfamily, schools, prisons, barracks, hospitals and factories all represent\ndisciplinary spaces that confine. The disciplinary subject changes from one\nmilieu of confinement to the next. In so doing, it moves within a _closed\nsystem_. The inhabitants of milieus of confinement can be ordered in space and\ntime. The animal of disciplinary society is the _mole_.\n\nIn his ‘Postscript on the Societies of Control’, Deleuze diagnoses a general\ncrisis affecting all milieus of confinement.[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch3-fn-1) Their\nclosedness and rigidity pose a problem: they are no longer suited to post-\nindustrial, immaterial and networked forms of production. The latter push for\nmore openness by breaking borders down. But the mole cannot bear such\nopenness. Accordingly, the snake takes the mole’s place. The snake is the\nanimal of neoliberal control society, to which disciplinary society has\nyielded. In contrast to the mole, the snake does not move in closed spaces.\nRather, _it makes space by means of its own movement_. The mole is a\n_labourer_. In contrast, the snake is an _entrepreneur_. The snake is the\nanimal of the neoliberal regime.\n\nThe mole moves through predetermined spaces; as such, it subordinates itself\nto spatial restrictions. The mole is a subjugated subject. But the snake is a\n_project_ inasmuch as it creates space through the course it steers. The\npassage from the mole to the snake – from subject to project – does not amount\nto setting out for an entirely new way of life; instead, it represents a\nmutation, indeed an intensification, of capitalism, which remains one and the\nsame. The mole’s restricted movements impose limits on productivity. Even when\nit labours in disciplined fashion, it cannot exceed a certain level of\nproductivity. The snake eliminates such limitations through new forms of\nmovement. Accordingly, the capitalist system is switching from the mole-model\nto the snake-model in order to generate more productivity.\n\nAccording to Deleuze, the disciplinary regime organizes itself as a ‘body’. It\nis a biopolitical regime. The neoliberal regime, in contrast, seems like a\n‘soul’.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch3-fn-2) As such, _psychopolitics_ is its form of\ngovernment: it is ‘constantly introducing an inexorable rivalry presented as\nhealthy competition … wonderful motivation’.[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch3-fn-3)\nMotivation, projects, competition, optimization and initiative represent\nfeatures of the psychopolitical technology of domination that constitutes the\nneoliberal regime. Above all, the snake embodies the guilt and debts (_die\nSchuld, die Schulden_) that the neoliberal regime employs as instruments of\ndomination.\n\n\n## [4.](05_Contents.xhtml#s4)\n\n## [Biopolitics](05_Contents.xhtml#s4)\n\nSince the seventeenth century, Foucault claims, power has ceased to manifest\nitself as the godlike sovereign’s capacity to deal death and instead taken the\nform of discipline. The power of sovereignty is the might of the sword. It\nthreatens with death and exploits the ‘privilege to seize hold of life in\norder to suppress it’.[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch4-fn-1) In contrast, disciplinary\npower is not a power to deal death, but a power over life: its function is no\nlonger to kill but to ‘invest life through and\nthrough’.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch4-fn-2) Hereby, the ‘old power of death’ yields\nto the careful ‘administration of bodies’ and ‘the calculated management of\nlife’.[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch4-fn-3)\n\nThe transition from the power of sovereignty to disciplinary power followed\nfrom changes in forms of production, specifically the shift from agrarian to\nindustrial production. As industrialization proceeded, it became necessary to\ndiscipline the body and fit it to machinic production. Instead of torturing\nthe body, disciplinary power yokes it into a system of norms. Calculated\ncoercion pervades each and every limb and comes to be inscribed even in the\nautomatism of habits. The body is calibrated to be a production-unit. A\n‘concerted orthopaedy’[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch4-fn-4) fashions ‘shapeless dough’\ninto a ‘machine’. Disciplines are ‘methods which [make] possible the\nmeticulous control of the operations of the body, which [assure] the constant\nsubjection of its forces and [impose] upon them a relation of docility-\nutility’.[5](20_Notes.xhtml#ch4-fn-5)\n\nDisciplinary power is normative power. It subjects the subject to a set of\nrules – norms, commandments and prohibitions – and eliminates deviations and\nanomalies. Such _negativity of training and drills_ (_Abrichtung_) is\nconstitutive of disciplinary power. On this point, it approaches the power of\nsovereignty, which has its basis in the negativity of _levying and\nconscription_ (_Abschöpfung_). Both sovereign power and disciplinary power\npursue allo-exploitation. They bring forth the obedience-subject.\n\nDisciplinary technology also reaches beyond the physical realm, into the\nmental sphere. After all, _industry_ means ‘hard work’. ‘Industrial school’\nwas another term for ‘reform school’. Bentham observed that his panopticon\nassures inmates’ moral improvement too. That said, disciplinary power does not\nfocus on the psyche. The _orthopaedic_ technology of disciplinary power is too\ncrude to penetrate into the deeper layers of the soul – with its hidden\nwishes, needs and desires – and take it over. Bentham’s Big Brother only\nobserves inmates from the outside. His panopticon is bound to the _optical\nmedium_. It has _no access to inner thoughts or needs_.\n\nDisciplinary power discovered ‘population’ as a productive and reproductive\nmass to be administrated carefully. Biopolitics is devoted to this task.\nReproductive cycles, birth and death rates, levels of general health, and life\nexpectancy provide the objects of regulation. Foucault explicitly discusses\nthe ‘ _biopolitics of the population_ ’.[6](20_Notes.xhtml#ch4-fn-6)\nBiopolitics is the governmental technology of disciplinary power. However,\nthis approach proves altogether unsuited to the neoliberal regime, which\nexploits the psyche above all. Biopolitics, which makes use of population\nstatistics, has no access to the psychic realm. It can deliver no material for\ndrawing up a _psychogram_ of the population. Demography is not the same thing\nas psychography. It cannot tap into or disclose the psyche. On this score,\nstatistics and Big Data lie worlds apart. Big Data provides the means for\nestablishing not just an individual but a _collective psychogram_ – perhaps\neven the _psychogram of the unconscious itself_. As such, it may yet shine a\nlight into the depths of the psyche and exploit the unconscious entirely.\n\n\n## [5.](05_Contents.xhtml#s5)\n\n## [Foucault’s Dilemma](05_Contents.xhtml#s5)\n\nAfter _Discipline and Punish_ , Foucault recognized that disciplinary society\ndid not reflect the times in every respect. In the late 1970s, he devoted his\nattention to neoliberal forms of government. However, the problem with his\nanalyses is that he stuck to the concepts of population and biopolitics: ‘It\nseems to me that … only when … we know what this governmental regime called\nliberalism was, will we be able to grasp what biopolitics\nis.’[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-1) Yet, in the course of this same series of\nlectures, he mentions neither biopolitics nor population again. At this\njuncture, Foucault evidently did not appreciate that biopolitics and\npopulation – which represent genuine categories of disciplinary society – are\nunsuited to describing the neoliberal regime. Consequently, he failed to do\nwhat the circumstances actually called for: to make the turn to\n_psychopolitics_.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-2)\n\nThe 1978–9 lectures do not undertake the analysis of neoliberal biopolitics.\nEven though he did not recognize the real problem, Foucault offered self-\ncritical remarks: ‘I would like to assure you that, in spite of everything, I\nreally did intend to talk about biopolitics, and then, things being what they\nare, I have ended up talking at length, and maybe for too long, about\nneoliberalism.’[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-3)\n\nIn the introduction to _Homo Sacer_ , Giorgio Agamben speculates that\n‘Foucault’s death kept him from showing how he would have developed the\nconcept and study of biopolitics.’[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-4) But counter to\nsuch guesswork, if Foucault’s early death kept him from anything, it deprived\nhim of the chance to reevaluate his idea of biopolitics – and abandon it in\norder to investigate neoliberal psychopolitics. Agamben’s analysis of\ndomination also fails to approach the technologies of power in the neoliberal\nregime in meaningful fashion. The _homines sacri_ of today have not been shut\nout of the system – they have been _shut into the system_.\n\nFoucault explicitly ties biopolitics to capitalism’s disciplinary form, which\nsocializes the body in its productive capacity: ‘For capitalist society, it\n[is] biopolitics, the biological, the somatic, the corporal, that [matters]\nmore than anything else.’[5](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-5) In other words,\nbiopolitics fundamentally concerns the biological and the physical. All in\nall, it constitutes a _politics of the body_ in the fullest sense.\n\nBut neoliberalism, a further development – indeed, a mutated form – of\ncapitalism, is not primarily concerned with ‘the biological, the somatic, the\ncorporal’. It has discovered the psyche as a productive force. This _psychic\nturn_ – that is, the _turn to psychopolitics_ – also connects with the mode of\noperation of contemporary capitalism. Now, immaterial and non-physical forms\nof production are what determine the course of capitalism. What gets produced\nare not material objects, but immaterial ones – for instance, information and\nprograms. The body no longer represents a central force of production, as it\nformerly did in biopolitical, disciplinary society. Now, productivity is not\nto be enhanced by _overcoming_ physical resistance so much as by _optimizing_\npsychic or mental processes. Physical discipline has given way to mental\noptimization. And neuro-enhancement differs from the disciplinary techniques\nof psychiatry fundamentally.\n\nToday, the body is being released from the immediate process of production and\nturning into the object of optimization, whether along aesthetic lines or in\nterms of health technology. Accordingly, orthopaedic intervention is yielding\nto _aesthetic_ intervention. Foucault’s ‘docile body’ has no place in this\nproduction process. Cosmetic surgery and fitness studios are taking the place\nof disciplinary orthopaedics. That said, physical optimization means more than\n_aesthetic_ practice alone: sexiness and fitness represent new economic\nresources to be increased, marketed and exploited.\n\nBernard Stiegler has rightly observed that Foucault’s concept of biopower is\nnot suited to the times: ‘Foucault’s biopower, which he himself describes (and\nso powerfully) historically and geographically by localizing it in Europe, is\nno longer the force behind _our_ age.’[6](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-6) According\nto Stiegler, biopower has been replaced by ‘ _psychotechnological_\npsychopower’.[7](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-7) Above all, he has in mind the\n‘programming industry’, which is ‘telecratic’: by reducing (_entmündigen_) us\nto impulsive (_triebgesteuert_) creatures of consumption, it induces mass\nregression. Such psychotechnics contrasts with the technology of writing and\nreading. For Stiegler, the medium of literacy means enlightenment.\nAccordingly, he invokes Kant: ‘Kant’s thought of maturity as humanity’s\nsovereignty’ is based on the ‘apparatus of reading and\nwriting’.[8](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-8)\n\nHowever, Stiegler’s overemphasis on television is problematic. For him, it\nrepresents the psychotechnical apparatus _tout court_ : ‘Now, at the beginning\nof the twenty-first century, cell phones, and … many other devices … catalyze\n… synaptic circuitry,’ yet it is ‘principally … television’ that governs the\ninflux of information.[9](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-9) In fact, the opposition\nbetween literacy and television affords a superannuated scheme of cultural\ncritique, which fails to do justice to the digital revolution. Strangely,\nStiegler hardly examines truly digital technology such as the internet and\nsocial media – which prove fundamentally different from the mass media of the\npast. What is more, he barely pays attention to the panoptic structure of\ndigital networks. As a result, he completely misses the workings of neoliberal\npsychopolitics, which employs digital technology on a massive scale.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Foucault turned to ‘technologies of the self’. The term\nrefers to ‘intentional and voluntary actions by which men not only set\nthemselves rules of conduct, but also seek to transform themselves, to change\nthemselves in their singular being, and to make their life into an _oeuvre_\nthat carries certain aesthetic values and meets certain stylistic\ncriteria’.[10](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-10) Foucault developed a historically\nsituated ethics of the self – and he did so in a context largely detached from\ntechnologies and techniques of power and domination. Consequently, it is often\nassumed that his ethics of the self stands in opposition to power and\ndomination. Indeed, Foucault himself pointed out the shift he was making from\ntechnologies of power to technologies of the self: ‘Perhaps I’ve insisted too\nmuch on the technology of domination and power. I am more and more interested\nin the interaction between oneself and others and in the technologies of\nindividual domination, the history of how an individual acts upon himself, in\nthe technology of the self.’[11](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-11)\n\nIn fact, the blind spot in Foucault’s analysis is the technology of power\nunder the neoliberal regime. Foucault did not see that _the neoliberal regime\nutterly claims the technology of the self for its own purposes_ : perpetual\nself-optimization – as the exemplary neoliberal technology of the self –\nrepresents nothing so much as a highly efficient mode of domination and\nexploitation.[12](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-12) As an ‘entrepreneur of\nhimself’,[13](20_Notes.xhtml#ch5-fn-13) the neoliberal achievement-subject\nengages in auto-exploitation willingly – and even passionately. The self-as-a-\nwork-of-art amounts to a beautiful but deceptive illusion that the neoliberal\nregime maintains in order to exhaust its resources entirely.\n\nUnder neoliberalism, the technology of power takes on a subtle form. It does\nnot lay hold of individuals directly. Instead, it ensures that individuals act\non themselves so that power relations are interiorized – and then interpreted\nas freedom. Self-optimization and submission, freedom and exploitation, fall\ninto one. Such engineering of freedom and exploitation, which occurs in order\nto effect self-exploitation, is what escaped Foucault.\n\n\n## [6.](05_Contents.xhtml#s6)\n\n## [Healing as Killing](05_Contents.xhtml#s6)\n\nNeoliberal psychopolitics is always coming up with more refined forms of\nexploitation. Countless self-management workshops, motivational retreats and\nseminars on personality or mental training promise boundless self-optimization\nand heightened efficiency. They are steered by neoliberal techniques of\ndomination, which aim to capitalize not just on working time but on the person\nhim- or herself: all the attention the individual commands and, indeed, his or\nher very life. Neoliberalism has discovered integral _human being_ as the\nobject of exploitation.\n\nThe neoliberal imperative of self-optimization serves only to promote perfect\nfunctioning within the system. Inhibitions, points of weakness and mistakes\nare to be therapeutically eliminated in order to enhance efficiency and\nperformance. In turn, everything is made comparable and measurable and\nsubjected to the logic of the market. It is not concern for the good life that\ndrives self-optimization. Rather, self-optimization follows from systemic\nconstraints – from the logic of quantifying success on the market.\n\nThe age of sovereignty was the age of levying and conscription: the\nexpropriation and appropriation of goods and services. The power of\nsovereignty expressed itself as the right to seize and dispose at will. In\ncontrast, disciplinary society banks on production. It is the age of active\nand industrial added-value. That said, the time for creating new value which\nis real is over and done. Indeed, under the financial capitalism of our day,\nvalue is being destroyed at the root – eradicated. The neoliberal regime is in\nthe course of inaugurating the age of exhaustion. Today, the psyche itself is\nbeing exploited. Accordingly, psychic maladies such as depression and burnout\ndefine our times.\n\nIn contemporary American self-help literature, the magic word is _healing_.\nThe term refers to self-optimization that is supposed to _therapeutically\neliminate_ any and all functional weakness or mental obstacle in the name of\nefficiency and performance. Yet perpetual self-optimization, which coincides\npoint-for-point with the optimization of the system, is proving destructive.\nIt is leading to _mental collapse_. Self-optimization, it turns out, amounts\nto total self-exploitation.\n\nThe neoliberal ideology of self-optimization displays religious – indeed,\nfanatical – traits. It entails a new form of subjectivation. Endlessly working\nat self-improvement resembles the self-examination and self-monitoring of\nProtestantism, which represents a technology of subjectivation and domination\nin its own right. Now, instead of searching out sins, one hunts down negative\nthoughts. The ego grapples with itself as an enemy. Today, even fundamentalist\npreachers act like managers and motivational trainers, proclaiming the new\nGospel of limitless achievement and optimization.\n\nIt is impossible to subordinate human personhood to the dictates of positivity\nentirely. Without negativity, life degrades into ‘something\ndead’.[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch6-fn-1) Indeed, negativity is what keeps life\nalive. Pain is constitutive for _experience_ (_Erfahrung_). Life that consists\nwholly of positive emotions and the sensation of\n‘flow’[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch6-fn-2) is not human at all. The human soul owes\nits defining tautness and depth precisely to negativity:\n\n> That tension of the soul in unhappiness which cultivates its strength … its\n> inventiveness and courage in enduring, persevering, interpreting, and\n> exploiting suffering, and whatever has been granted to it of profundity,\n> secret, mask, spirit, cunning, greatness – was it not granted through\n> suffering, through the discipline of great\n> suffering?[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch6-fn-3)\n\nThe imperative of boundless optimization even manages to exploit pain. Thus,\nthe famous motivational speaker Tony Robbins has written:\n\n> When you set a goal, you’ve committed to CANI (Constant, Never-Ending\n> Improvement)! You’ve acknowledged the need that all human beings have for\n> constant, never-ending improvement. There is a power in the pressure of\n> dissatisfaction, in the tension of temporary discomfort. This is the kind of\n> pain you _want_ in your life.[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch6-fn-4)\n\nNow, the only pain that is tolerated is pain that can be exploited for the\npurposes of optimization.\n\nBut the violence of positivity is just as destructive as the violence of\nnegativity.[5](20_Notes.xhtml#ch6-fn-5) Neoliberal psychopolitics, with the\nconsciousness industry it promotes, is destroying the human soul, which is\nanything but a machine of positivity (_Positivmaschine_). The neoliberal\nsubject is running aground on the imperative of self-optimization, that is, on\nthe compulsion always to achieve more and more. Healing, it turns out, means\nkilling.\n\n\n## [7.](05_Contents.xhtml#s7)\n\n## [Shock](05_Contents.xhtml#s7)\n\nNaomi Klein’s _Shock Doctrine_ , which smacks of conspiracy, calls the first\nof its two main characters ‘Doctor Shock’. This is the name given to the\nMontreal psychiatrist Dr Ewen Cameron, who believed that administering\nelectric shocks could destroy bad elements within the brain, erase them and\nenable a new personality to be constructed starting from a ‘clean slate’. By\nmeans of electroshock, Cameron plunged his patients into a state of chaos that\nwas supposed to provide the basis for their rebirth as healthy, model\ncitizens. In other words, he understood the acts of destruction he performed\nas a kind of creation. The psyche was subjected to a violent ‘de-branding’ and\n‘re-branding’. It was to be newly formatted and rewritten, as it were.\n\nCameron set up a panopticon with isolation chambers, where he conducted human\nexperiments of the utmost cruelty. The rooms were like torture chambers.\nFirst, over the course of a month, patients were administered powerful\nelectroshocks. This served to expunge their memories. In the process, they\nwere also given mind-altering drugs. Their hands and arms were stuck in\ncardboard tubes in order to keep them from touching their bodies, i.e. to\nprevent them from having any encounter with their own self-image. Moreover,\nCameron deprived his patients of sensory impressions by inducing extended\nsleep by pharmaceutical means: they were brought out of this state only to eat\nand perform bodily functions. Such conditions could last for up to thirty\ndays. Staff were instructed to prohibit patients from speaking. Cameron’s\nhospital was a panopticon far crueller than Bentham’s.\n\nThe CIA funded Cameron’s research, which took place at the height of the Cold\nWar. A fervent anticommunist, Cameron thought his experiments were part of the\nbattle. He likened his patients to communist prisoners of war undergoing\ninterrogation.[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch7-fn-1) Indeed, his practices resembled\ninterrogation techniques; they occurred in conjunction with brainwashing and\nthe ideological struggles of the Cold War. The Manichaean opposition between\nGood and Evil lay at their foundation: Evil would be wiped away, eradicated,\nand replaced by Good. Likewise, the _negativity_ of immunological defence\nagainst the Other, or the Enemy, defined Cameron’s practices. As Doctor Shock,\nCameron represents a phenomenon of the _Immunological Age_. The immunological\nintervention of shock therapy takes aim at the Other, the Alien, the Enemy. It\nis meant to disarm the adversary, so his soul may be inscribed with a\ndifferent ideology, another narrative.\n\nKlein’s other main character – the second Doctor Shock – is Milton Friedman,\nthe theologian of the neoliberal market. Klein draws parallels between the two\nmen. For Friedman, the state of shock that follows a catastrophe offers the\nopportunity – indeed, the ideal moment – for society to be reshaped.\nAccordingly, the neoliberal regime should operate by means of shock, which\nwipes the psyche clean and empties it out. When it has been rendered\ndefenceless, the mind readily accepts radical reprogramming. When people are\nstill paralyzed and traumatized by disaster, they can become the objects of\nneoliberal conditioning:\n\n> Friedman’s mission, like Cameron’s, rested on a dream of reaching back to a\n> state of ‘natural’ health, when all was in balance, before human\n> interferences created distorting patterns. Where Cameron dreamed of\n> returning the human mind to that pristine state, Friedman dreamed of\n> depatterning societies, of returning them to a state of pure capitalism,\n> cleansed of all interruptions – government regulations, trade barriers and\n> entrenched interests. Also like Cameron, Friedman believed that when the\n> economy is highly distorted, the only way to reach that prelapsarian state\n> was to deliberately inflict painful shocks: only ‘bitter medicine’ could\n> clear those distortions and bad patterns out of the\n> way.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch7-fn-2)\n\nBut Klein’s theory of shock blinds her to the actual workings of neoliberal\npsychopolitics. Shock therapy is a genuinely disciplinary technique. Violent\npsychiatric interventions of this kind are employed in disciplinary society\nalone: they number among the biopolitical measures of coercion. As psycho-\ndisciplines, they are orthopaedic in nature. In contrast, the neoliberal\ntechnology of power does not exercise disciplinary coercion. Electroshock’s\nmode of operation differs fundamentally from that of neoliberal\npsychopolitics. Electroshock owes its efficacy to paralyzing and annihilating\nthe contents of the psyche. Its essential trait is _negativity_. In contrast,\nneoliberal psychopolitics is dominated by _positivity_. Instead of working\nwith negative threats, it works with _positive stimuli_. Instead of\nadministering ‘bitter medicine’, it enlists _Liking_. It flatters the psyche\ninstead of shaking it and paralyzing it with shocks. Neoliberal psychopolitics\nseduces the soul; it preempts it in lieu of opposing it. It carefully\nprotocols desires, needs and wishes instead of ‘depatterning’ them. By means\nof calculated prognoses, it anticipates actions – and acts ahead of them\ninstead of cancelling them out. Neoliberal psychopolitics is SmartPolitics: it\nseeks to please and fulfil, not to repress.\n\n\n## [8.](05_Contents.xhtml#s8)\n\n## [Friendly Big Brother](05_Contents.xhtml#s8)\n\n‘Newspeak’ is the name for the ideal language in George Orwell’s surveillance\nstate. It is meant to supplant ‘oldspeak’ entirely. Newspeak has only one\ngoal: to restrict room for thinking freely. Every year, words decrease in\nnumber, and the space for conscious thought diminishes. Syme, a friend of\n_1984_ ’s hero Winston, raves about the beauty of destroying words.\n‘Thoughtcrimes’, he enthuses, will be made impossible when the words necessary\nfor them are struck from the lexicon. In the process, the notion of freedom\nwill be abolished too. On this score, Orwell’s surveillance state differs\nfundamentally from the world of the digital panopticon – which uses freedom to\nexcess. Today’s society of information is not characterized by destroying\nwords, but by multiplying them without end.\n\nThe spirit of the Cold War and the negativity of enmity dominate Orwell’s\nnovel. The country it describes is in a state of permanent war. Julia,\nWinston’s love interest, speculates that the bombs raining down on London\nevery day have been launched by Big Brother and the Party in order to maintain\nfear and terror in the populace. The ‘Enemy of the People’ is called Emmanuel\nGoldstein. He commands a network of underground conspirators seeking to\noverthrow the government. Big Brother is at ideological war with Goldstein.\n‘Two Minutes Hate’, broadcast daily on the ‘telescreen’, takes aim at\nGoldstein. In the ‘Ministry of Truth’ – in fact, a Ministry of Lies – the past\nis revised and fitted to ideology. Orwell’s surveillance state employs the\npsychotechnical methods of brainwashing: electroshock, sleep deprivation,\nsolitary confinement, drugs and physical torture. The ‘Ministry of Plenty’\n(newspeak: ‘Miniplenty’) sees to it that consumer goods are always lacking, so\nthat an artificial state of need may be maintained.\n\nOrwell’s surveillance state, with its telescreens and torture chambers, is\nfundamentally different from today’s digital panopticon, with its internet,\nsmartphones and Google Glass. In the digital panopticon, the illusion of\nlimitless freedom and communication predominates. Here there is no torture –\njust tweets and posts. Nor is there a mysterious ‘Ministry of Truth’.\nTransparency and information have taken the place of truth. The new conception\nof power does not involve controlling the past, but steering the future\npsychopolitically.\n\nThe neoliberal technology of power does not prohibit, protect or repress;\ninstead, it prospects, permits and projects. Consumption is not held in check,\nbut maximized. No production of scarcity occurs; instead, surplus is generated\n– indeed, a superabundance of positivity. Everyone is encouraged to\ncommunicate and consume. The principle of negativity, which still defined\nOrwell’s state, has yielded to the principle of positivity. Needs are not\nrepressed, but stimulated. Confession obtained by force has been replaced by\nvoluntary disclosure. Smartphones have been substituted for torture chambers.\nBig Brother now wears a _friendly_ face. His _friendliness_ is what makes\nsurveillance so efficient.\n\nBentham’s Big Brother was invisible, but he was everywhere in prisoners’\nminds. Inmates interiorized him. In contrast, the inhabitants of today’s\ndigital panopticon never really feel that they are being watched or\nthreatened. Consequently, ‘surveillance state’ is an imprecise name for\ndescribing the digital panopticon. Here, everyone feels free. However,\nprecisely this _feeling of freedom_ – which is nowhere to be found in Orwell’s\nstate – is now the problem.\n\nThe digital panopticon thrives on its occupants’ voluntary self-exposure.\nSelf-exploitation and self-illumination follow the same logic. In either case,\nfreedom is exploited. The digital panopticon lacks a Big Brother wresting\ninformation from us against our will. Instead, we lay ourselves bare\nvoluntarily.\n\nThe advertisement that Apple aired during the 1984 Superbowl has become the\nstuff of legend. In it the company presented itself as a force of liberation,\nwhich would counter the Orwellian surveillance state. In lock-step, listless\nworkers – evidently without a will of their own – march into a vast hall and\nlisten to Big Brother’s fanatical declamations on the telescreen. Then the ad\nshows a woman rushing into the assembly hall, the Thought Police in hot\npursuit. Bearing a sledgehammer before her heaving breast, she dashes forward.\nFull of resolve, she runs straight up to Big Brother and throws the\nsledgehammer at the telescreen with all the force she can muster; it explodes\nin a dazzling burst of light. The assembled workers promptly awaken from their\ntorpor. A voice declares: ‘On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce\nMacintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like _1984_.’ But despite Apple’s\nmessage, 1984 did not signal the end of the surveillance state so much as the\ninception of a new kind of control society – one whose operations surpass the\nOrwellian state by leaps and bounds. Now, communication and control have\nbecome one, without remainder. Now, everyone is his or her own panopticon.\n\n\n## [9.](05_Contents.xhtml#s9)\n\n## [Emotional Capitalism](05_Contents.xhtml#s9)\n\nToday, talk of feeling and emotion has grown inflationary. Many academic\ndisciplines are researching emotion. All of a sudden, the human being no\nlonger counts as an _animal rationale_ ; instead, man is a creature of\nsentiment. That said, hardly anyone bothers to ask where this sudden interest\nin emotions came from. Scientific emotion-researchers are clearly not\nreflecting much on their own activities. Thus, they have failed to remark that\nthe emotional ‘boom’ stems from an economic process, above all. Worse still,\nutter conceptual confusion prevails. ‘Emotion’, ‘feeling’ and ‘affect’ seem\ninterchangeable for many researchers.\n\nYet feeling and emotion are not identical. We speak, for instance, of a\nfeeling for language, athletics or other people – _Sprachgefühl, Ballgefühl,\nMitgefühl_ (respectively: linguistic aptitude, a knack for sports and\ncompassion). One may ‘have a feel for language’ or ‘feel for others’, but no\none has an ‘emotion for language’ or experiences ‘com-emotion’. There is no\nsuch thing as ‘language-affect’ or ‘com-affect’ either. Mourning is a feeling\ntoo. But it sounds strange to speak of an ‘affect of mourning’ or an ‘emotion\nof mourning’. Affect and emotion refer to strictly subjective matters, whereas\nfeeling refers to something objective.\n\nFeeling can be recounted. It has narrative length, or breadth. Neither affect\nnor emotion admits an _account_. The crisis of feelings that can be observed\nin contemporary theatre also represents a crisis of _giving-account_\n(_Erzählung_). Today, the narrative theatre of feelings is yielding to a\nclamorous _theatre of affects_. Because narrative is lacking, an affective\nmass gets piled onto the stage. But, in contrast to feeling, affect does not\nopen up _space_. Instead, it steers a linear _path_ in order to discharge, to\nunload itself. The digital medium is an affect-medium too. Digital\ncommunication fosters the _immediate_ release of affect: catharsis\n(_Affektabfuhr_). Simply on the basis of its temporality, digital\ncommunication conveys affect more than it transmits feeling. Shitstorms are\nstreams of affect. They represent exemplary phenomena of digital\ncommunication.\n\nFeelings are _constative_. For instance, we say: ‘I have a feeling _that_.’ In\ncontrast, it is impossible to say, ‘I have an affect (or an emotion) _that_.’\nEmotions are not _constative_ , but _performative_. They refer to actions and\ndeeds. Furthermore, they are intentional and goal-oriented. Feelings, on the\nother hand, do not necessarily display an intentional structure. Often, the\nfeeling of anxiety has no concrete object. That is what makes anxiety\ndifferent from fear, which has an intentional structure. Nor is a ‘feel’ –\nthat is, a sense – for language intentional. Its non-intentionality is what\ndistinguishes it from linguistic _expression_ , which, because it _ex-presses_\n, is _e-motive_. A feeling of cosmic oneness – an oceanic sense of the world\n(_ein kosmisches Mitgefühl, ein ozeanisches Welt-Gefühl_) – that does not\nfocus on anything or anyone in particular is also possible. Neither emotions\nnor affects achieve the dimensions that characterize feelings. Emotions and\naffects are expressions of subjectivity.\n\nFeelings also have a different temporality than emotions. They admit\n_duration_. Emotions prove significantly more fleeting and short-lived than\nfeelings. Likewise, affect is often limited to a single moment. In contrast to\nfeelings, emotions do not represent a _state_. The emotion does not _stand_.\nThere is no _emotion of rest_. A _feeling of calm_ is easy to conceive. In\ncontrast, the expression ‘emotional state’ has a paradoxical ring. Emotions\nare dynamic, situative and performative. Emotional capitalism exploits\nprecisely these qualities. Feelings, in contrast, cannot be readily exploited\ninasmuch as they have no performativity. Finally, affects are not performative\nso much as eruptive; they lack _performative directionality_.\n\n_Atmosphere_ – or _mood_ (_Stimmung_) – differs from both feeling and emotion.\nIt possesses even more objectivity than feeling. Objectively, a space or room\ncan harbour any given atmosphere. An atmosphere or mood expresses a _way-it-\nis_. In contrast, emotions derive from deviations from the way-it-is. For\ninstance, a place may diffuse a friendly mood. This atmosphere is something\nwholly objective. But there is no such thing as a friendly emotion or a\nfriendly affect. Atmosphere/mood is neither intentional nor performative. It\nis the element _where one happens to find oneself_ (_etwas, worin man sich\nbefindet_). It represents a state of being or state of mind\n(_Befindlichkeit_). As such, atmosphere is _static_ and _constellative_ –\nwhereas emotion is _dynamic_ and _performative_. _Where_ distinguishes a\nstate, a disposition; in contrast _whither_ – a direction – defines emotion.\nFeeling, in turn, is a matter of _wherefore_ : ‘why’.\n\nEva Illouz’s _Cold Intimacies: The Making of Emotional Capitalism_ offers no\nanswer to the question of why it is that feelings experience a boom under\nconditions of capitalism, in particular. What is more, the book equates\nfeelings and emotions without drawing any conceptual distinction at all. Nor\nis it very useful to locate the question of feelings under capitalism at its\ninaugural stages: ‘Weber’s Protestant ethic contains at its core a thesis\nabout the role of emotions in economic action, for it is the anxiety provoked\nby an inscrutable divinity which is at the heart of the capitalist\nentrepreneur’s frantic activity.’[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch9-fn-1) It is mistaken\nto understand anxiety in terms of emotion. Anxiety is a feeling. Its\ncorresponding temporality proves incompatible with affect. Affect is not a\nconstant state. As such, it lacks the constancy that defines feeling. It is\nthe constant _feeling_ of anxiety that would entail frantic entrepreneurial\nactivity. But what Weber analyses is the ascetic capitalism of accumulation,\nwhich obeys rational logic more than it follows emotional logic. Accordingly,\ncapitalism of this sort does not feed into consumer capitalism, which derives\nits profits from emotions. Moreover, consumer capitalism operates through the\nselling and consumption of meanings and emotions. It is not use value but\nemotive or cultic value that plays a constitutive role in the economy of\nconsumption. By the same token, Illouz fails to account for the fact that\nemotion comes to possess value for capitalism only when a switch to immaterial\nproduction occurs. Emotions have become a means of production only in our own\ntimes.\n\nIllouz also contends that the core of Durkheimian sociology, solidarity,\nrepresents a ‘bundle of emotions’ binding social actors to the central symbols\nof the society they inhabit. Summing up her argument, she declares:\n\n> Unbeknown to them, canonical sociological accounts of modernity contain, if\n> not a full-fledged theory of emotions, at least numerous references to them:\n> anxiety, love, competitiveness, indifference, guilt are all present in most\n> historical and sociological accounts of the ruptures which have led to the\n> modern era.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch9-fn-2)\n\nAll of these references to various sociological theories of emotion do nothing\nat all to explain the boom of emotion _today_. This corresponds to Illouz’s\nneglect of conceptual distinctions between feeling, emotion and affect. After\nall, ‘indifference’ and ‘guilt’ are neither affects nor emotions. It is only\nmeaningful to speak of the _feeling_ of guilt.\n\nClearly, Illouz has failed to notice that the boom of emotion in our times\nultimately derives from neoliberalism. The neoliberal regime deploys emotions\nas resources in order to bring about heightened productivity and achievement.\nStarting at a certain level of production, _rationality_ – which is the medium\nof disciplinary society – hits a limit. Henceforth, it is experienced as a\nconstraint, an inhibition. Suddenly, it seems rigid and inflexible. At this\npoint, _emotionality_ takes its place, which is attended by the feeling of\nliberty – the free unfolding of personality. After all, being free means\ngiving free rein to emotions. Emotional capitalism banks on freedom. It hails\nemotion as the expression of unbridled subjectivity. Neoliberal technologies\nof power exploit this same subjectivity mercilessly.\n\nRationality is defined by objectivity, generality and steadiness. As such, it\nstands opposed to emotionality, which is subjective, situative and volatile.\nEmotions arise, above all, when circumstances change – and perception shifts.\nRationality entails duration, consistency and regularity. It prefers stable\nconditions. The neoliberal economy, increasingly dismantling continuity and\nprogressively integrating instability in order to enhance productivity, is\npushing the emotionalization of the productive process forward. Accelerated\ncommunication also promotes its emotionalization. Rationality is _slower_ than\nemotionality; it _has no speed_ , as it were. Thus, the pressure of\nacceleration now is leading to a _dictatorship of emotion_.\n\nConsumer capitalism enlists emotion in order to generate more desires and\nneeds. _Emotional Design_ moulds emotions and shapes emotional patterns for\nthe sake of maximizing consumption. All in all, today we do not consume things\nso much as emotions. The former cannot be consumed without end – but the\nlatter can. Emotions assume dimensions beyond the scope of use value. In so\ndoing, they open up a field of consumption that is new and knows no limit.\n\nIn disciplinary society, where one’s task is to _function_ , emotions\nrepresent disturbances. Accordingly, every effort is made to weed them out.\nDisciplinary society’s ‘concerted orthopaedy’ seeks to make a shapeless mass\nof dough into an unfeeling machine. Machines function best when all emotions\nand feelings have been switched off.\n\nThe boom in emotion today stems, not least of all, from a new, immaterial mode\nof production in which communicative interaction plays an ever-greater role.\nIt calls not just for cognitive competence, but also for emotional competence.\nIn this context, the integral person is _installed_ in the very process of\nproduction. Daimler-Chrysler has publicly declared that since employees’\n‘behaviour and their social and emotional skills play an increasing role in\nthe evaluation of their work … this will … be assessed … on the basis of\nobjectives achieved and the quality of outcomes.’[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch9-fn-3)\nNow, sociality, communication and even individual conduct are being exploited.\nEmotions provide ‘raw material’ with which to optimize corporate\ncommunication. As Hewlett-Packard puts it: ‘HP is a firm where one can breathe\na spirit of communication, a strong spirit of interrelations, where people can\ncommunicate, where you go towards others. It is an affective\nrelationship.’[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch9-fn-4)\n\nA paradigm shift is taking place at the administrative level of companies.\nEmotions are being granted more and more significance. Rational management\ntechniques are being replaced by _emotional management_. Managers today are\nleaving the principle of rational action behind. Increasingly, they resemble\n_motivation coaches_. Motivation connects with emotion. Positive emotions\nprovide the ferment that makes _motivation_ grow.\n\nEmotions are performative in so far as they call forth certain actions. As\n_inclinations_ , they represent the energetic – the sensory, or even sensuous\n– basis for action. Emotions are steered by the limbic system, which is also\nwhere the drives are seated. They form the pre-reflexive, half-conscious,\nphysico-instinctual level of action that escapes full awareness. Neoliberal\npsychopolitics seizes on emotion _in order to influence actions on this pre-\nreflexive level_. By way of emotion, it manages to cut and operate deep\ninside. As such, emotion affords a highly efficient medium for\npsychopolitically steering the integral person, the person as a whole.\n\n\n## [10.](05_Contents.xhtml#s10)\n\n## [Gamification](05_Contents.xhtml#s10)\n\nIn order to heighten productivity, emotional capitalism also enlists playing\nand games – which should, in fact, be the _Other of Work_ , its opposite.\nEmotional capitalism is gamifying the life- and working world. Playing games\nlends an emotional, indeed a dramatic, charge to working – which in turn\ngenerates more motivation. Because games rapidly deliver a sense of success\nand reward, the result is higher performance and a greater yield. A person\nplaying a game, being emotionally invested, is much more engaged than a worker\nwho acts rationally or is simply _functioning_.\n\nGames exhibit a specific temporality marked by immediate experiences of\nsuccess and reward. But what matures over time cannot be gamified. Whatever is\nlong, anything that lasts a long time, proves incompatible with the game’s\ntemporality. Hunting, for instance, matches the mode of the game, whereas\nfarming, which depends on slow processes of ripening and quiet growth, cannot\nbe gamified at all. Life cannot be turned into hunting alone.\n\nThe gamification of work exploits _homo ludens_. The player subjugates him- or\nherself to the order of domination _in the very act of playing_. Today, the\ngamification logic of ‘Likes’, ‘Friends’ and ‘Followers’ means that social\ncommunication is also being plugged into and subordinated to a game mode. The\ncorollary of the gamification of communication is its commercialization. That\nsaid, this process is destroying _human_ communication.\n\n‘A corpse is running society – the corpse of labour’ (_Ein Leichnam beherrscht\ndie Gesellschaft – der Leichnam der Arbeit_). So begins the _Manifesto against\nLabour_ , written by the _Krisis-Group_ , which is based around Robert\nKurz.[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch10-fn-1) Following the microelectronic revolution,\nthe argument goes, the production of wealth has grown increasingly detached\nfrom human labour. Yet at the same time, society has never been so thoroughly\ncommitted to work as it is in our post-Fordist age – an epoch that, in actual\nfact, is only making labour more and more superfluous. The manifesto points\nout that the political Left, in particular, has exalted labour. Not only has\nit declared work the essence of human _being_ ; more still, it has mystified\nlabour and pronounced it the opposite principle to capital. The Left does not\nview work itself as a scandal – only its exploitation. For this reason, the\nmanifesto concludes, the programme of all workers’ parties has always been\nsimply the liberation of labour, instead of liberation _from_ labour. Labour\nand Capital, then, represent two sides of the same coin.\n\nYet despite highly vigorous forces of production, we have not witnessed the\nadvent of the ‘realm of freedom’ (_Reich der Freiheit_) where ‘labour\ndetermined by necessity and external expediency\nends’.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch10-fn-2) Ultimately, Marx himself adhered to the\n_primacy of labour_ : the ‘increase of free time’, he contends, ‘reacts back\nupon the power of labour as itself the greatest productive\npower’.[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch10-fn-3) But with that, the realm of necessity\ncomes to colonize the realm of freedom. ‘Idle time’ as ‘time for higher\nactivity’ transforms its possessor ‘into a different subject’ with greater\nproductive force than one who merely toils. As ‘time for the full development\nof the individual’, free time contributes to the ‘production of _fixed\ncapital_ ’.[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch10-fn-4) In fact, this means that knowledge\ngets capitalized too. In modern parlance, more leisure time means increased\n_human capital_ : idleness that might otherwise be devoted to activities free\nof purpose and constraint are integrated into the operations of Capital. Even\nthough Marx speaks of ‘ _capital fixe_ being man himself’, human beings,\nendowed with ‘general intellect’, are now transforming themselves into\nCapital. In contrast, true freedom would be possible only if life were\nentirely freed from Capital – which represents a new form of transcendence.\nThe transcendence of Capital stands in the way of _life as immanence_.\n\nContrary to Marx’s assumptions, the dialectic between forces of production and\nrelations of production is not leading to freedom. More than anything else, it\nis entangling us in exploitation along new lines. We would have to think with\nMarx beyond Marx in order to make freedom – indeed, time that is free – our\nown. It could only come from the Other of Work: a wholly other force that no\nlonger serves production or admits transformation into any kind of workforce\nat all. In other words, freedom could only come from a _mode of living_\n(_Lebensform_) that is no longer a _mode of production_ – indeed, from\n_something altogether unproductive_. The course our future takes will depend\non whether we prove able, beyond the world of production, to _make use of the\nuseless_.\n\nThe human being is a creature of luxury. In the original and authentic sense,\nluxury is not a practice of consumption. Rather, it means a mode of living\nthat is free of necessity. Freedom is based on deviation: _luxuriance_ ,\ngetting away from necessity (_Notwendigkeit_). Luxury transcends the intention\nof averting need (_die Not zu wenden_). But today, consumption is co-opting\neven luxury. Excessive consumption amounts to unfreedom: compulsion\ncorresponding to the unfreedom of labour. Luxury as freedom – like play that\nis truly free – can be thought only beyond the world of work and consumption.\nViewed in this light, it stands close to asceticism.\n\nTrue happiness comes from what runs riot, lets go, is exuberant and loses\nmeaning – the excessive and superfluous. That is, it comes from what\nluxuriates, what has taken leave of all necessity, work, performance and\npurpose. But today, even excess is being pocketed by Capital, which strips it\nof its emancipatory potential entirely. What is more, playing and games belong\nto luxury too – but as play that is not yoked to the process of labour and\nproduction. As a means of production, gamification is destroying play’s\npotential to set free. Play should make it possible to use things in wholly\ndifferent ways; it should liberate them from the theology and teleology of\nCapital.\n\nNot long ago, a highly unusual incident in Greece was reported. It was all the\nmore unusual for occurring in a country suffering so greatly under the yoke of\nCapital. The event possesses a singularly _emblematic_ quality – so much so\nthat it seems like a _sign from the future_. Children, it is said, found a\nlarge bundle of banknotes in the ruins of a house. They made use of them in a\nwholly other way: playing with them and tearing them to shreds. Perhaps these\nchildren anticipated a future we will share: _the world lies in rubble; in the\nruins, we are playing too – tearing apart paper money_.\n\n‘Profanation’ means taking things that belonged to the gods – and were\ntherefore removed from mortal use – and returning them to human beings to do\nwith as they will.[5](20_Notes.xhtml#ch10-fn-5) The Greek children were\n_profaning_ money by handing it over to an entirely other use: games and play.\nIn a single stroke, profanation transformed what is so fetishized today –\nmoney – into a common toy.\n\nAgamben understands religion in terms of the Latin _relegere_. Accordingly, it\nmeans being attentive and alert: watching over things that are holy and taking\ncare that they remain separate from other things. Such setting-apart is\nessential to religion. Profanation, then, means adopting an _attitude of\nconscious negligence_ with regard to this same watchfulness. The children in\nGreece were displaying carelessness about money when they simply played with\nit and tore it apart. As such, profanation represents a _practice of freedom_\nthat liberates us from transcendence – from any and every form of\nsubjectivation. In this manner, profanation opens a _playful margin of\nimmanence_ (_Spiel-Raum der Immanenz_).\n\nThere are two forms of thinking: thinking at work and thinking at play. The\nconceptions advanced by Hegel and Marx are governed by the principle of work.\nLikewise, Heidegger’s _Being and Time_ is still bound to working. In its\n‘care’ or ‘anxiety’, _Dasein_ does not play. Only later did Heidegger discover\nplay, which is based on ‘releasement’ (_Gelassenheit_). In this light, he came\nto interpret the world itself as play. Now, he sought out the ‘open (_das\nOffene_) of a free space hardly surmised and heeded, in which beings come into\nplay as such’.[6](20_Notes.xhtml#ch10-fn-6) Heidegger’s ‘time-play-space’\n(_Zeit-Spiel-Raum_) gestures towards a time-space free of labour in any form.\nIn this _realm of the event, psychology_ has been completely surpassed as a\nmode of subjectivation.\n\n\n## [11.](05_Contents.xhtml#s11)\n\n## [Big Data](05_Contents.xhtml#s11)\n\n**Columbus and His Egg**\n\nBentham likened his panopticon to ‘Columbus and his _egg_\n’.[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-1) By his account, the invention should be\napplied to all disciplinary milieus of incarceration because it promotes the\nexceptionally efficient surveillance of inmates. The panopticon represents a\nwatershed in the social order: ‘What would you say, if by the gradual adoption\nand diversified application of this single principle, you should see a new\nscene of things spread itself over the face of civilized\nsociety?’[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-2)\n\nWill Big Data also prove to be Columbus’s egg for the contemporary society of\ndigital control – a system even more effective than Bentham’s panopticon? Will\nit actually manage not just to watch over human behaviour, but also to subject\nit to psychopolitical steering? Is another, wholly unintuited drama poised to\nredraw the face of civilized society itself?\n\nIf nothing else, Big Data has given rise to a highly efficient form of\ncontrol. Acxiom, an American Big Data company, promises clients a ‘360-degree\ncustomer view’. Indeed, the digital panopticon has made possible a wraparound\nview of those who dwell within it. Bentham’s panopticon was confined to a\nperspectival optical system. This meant that blind spots were unavoidable –\nhere, prisoners could indulge in secret wishes and thoughts without being\nobserved.\n\nDigital surveillance proves so efficient because it is _aperspectival_. It\ndoes not suffer from the perspectival limitations characterizing analogue\noptical systems. Digital optics enables surveillance from any and every angle.\nIt eliminates all blind spots. In contrast to analogue and perspectival\noptics, it can peer into the human soul itself.\n\n**Dataism**\n\nIn the pages of the _New York Times_ , David Brooks has announced a data\nrevolution. His words are as prophetic as Chris Anderson’s famous article ‘The\nEnd of Theory’. ‘Dataism’ is the name of the new faith:\n\n> If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I’d say it is\n> data-ism. We now have the ability to gather huge amounts of data. This\n> ability seems to carry with it certain cultural assumptions – that\n> everything that can be measured should be measured; that data is a\n> transparent and reliable lens that allows us to filter out emotionalism and\n> ideology; that data will help us do remarkable things – like foretell the\n> future … The data revolution is giving us wonderful ways to understand the\n> present and the past.[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-3)\n\nDataism has taken the stage with the fervour of a _second Enlightenment_.\nDuring the _first Enlightenment_ , statistics was thought to possess the\ncapacity to liberate human knowledge from the clutches of mythology.\nAccordingly, euphoric celebration occurred. In light of such developments,\nVoltaire even voiced the wish for a new historiography, freed from past\nsuperstition. Statistics, as he put it, offers ‘an object of curiosity for\nanyone who would like to read history as a citizen and as a\nphilosopher’.[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-4) Revised by statistics, history\nwould become truly philosophical. As Rüdiger Campe writes, ‘The numbers of\nstatistics provide the _basis_ from which [Voltaire] can articulate his\nmethodological mistrust of all histories that exist only as narratives. The\nstories of _ancient history_ accordingly offer an example that borders on\nmythology for [him].’[5](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-5) Statistics and\nEnlightenment are one and the same for Voltaire. Statistics means setting\n_objective knowledge founded on, and driven by, numbers_ in opposition to\nmythological narration.\n\nNow, _transparency_ is the buzzword of the second Enlightenment. Data are\nsupposed to be a pellucid medium. As Brooks describes them, data afford a\n‘transparent and reliable lens’. The imperative of the second Enlightenment\ndeclares: everything must become data and information. The soul of the second\nEnlightenment is data totalitarianism, or data fetishism. Although it\nannounces that it is taking leave of all ideology, dataism itself is an\nideology. It is leading to _digital totalitarianism_. Therefore, a _third\nEnlightenment_ is called for – in order to shine a light on how digital\nenlightenment has transformed into a new kind of servitude.\n\nBig Data is supposed to be freeing knowledge from subjective arbitrariness. By\nthis logic, intuition does not represent a higher form of knowing; instead, it\nrepresents something merely subjective – a stopgap compensating for the\nshortage of objective data. In complex situations, the argument goes,\nintuition is blind. The mistrust even extends to theory, which is suspected of\nbeing an ideology: if enough data are available, it should prove superfluous\nas well. The second Enlightenment is the age of purely _data-driven_\nknowledge. Anderson’s visionary rhetoric goes: ‘Out with every theory of human\nbehavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and\npsychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and\nwe can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data, the\nnumbers speak for themselves.’[6](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-6)\n\nThe medium of the first Enlightenment was reason. However, imagination,\ncorporeality and desire were repressed in its name. By a fatal dialectic, the\nfirst Enlightenment switched over into barbarism. Now, in the second\nEnlightenment – which appeals to information, data and transparency – the same\ndialectic threatens to do the same. The second Enlightenment is summoning\nforth a new kind of violence. The _Dialectic of Enlightenment_ holds that the\nprocess of illumination that set out to destroy mythology became entangled,\nwith every stride it made, in a mythology of its own: ‘False clarity is only\nanother name for myth.’[7](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-7) Adorno would say that the\n‘transparency’ of today is another name for myth too – that dataism likewise\nheralds false clarity. The dialectic of old is also making the second\nEnlightenment, which seeks to counter ideology, into an ideology in its own\nright – more still, it is leading to the _barbarism of data_.\n\nDataism, it turns out, is amounting to digital Dadaism. Dadaism also takes\nleave of meaningful contexts of every kind. It empties language itself of\nsense: ‘The acts of life have no beginning or end. Everything happens in a\ncompletely idiotic way. That is why everything is alike. Simplicity is called\nDada.’[8](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-8) Dataism is\nnihilism.[9](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-9) It gives up on any and all meaning.\nData and numbers are not narrative; they are additive. Meaning, on the other\nhand, is based on narration. Data simply fills up the senseless void.\n\nNow, numbers and data are not just being absolutized – they are becoming\nsexualized and fetishized. This amounts to nothing other than libidinal energy\nflowing into today’s ‘Quantified Self’. On the whole, dataism is displaying\nlibidinous – indeed, pornographic – traits. _Dataists_ mate with their data.\nIn the meanwhile, there is even talk of ‘datasexuals’. They are ‘relentlessly\ndigital’ and consider data ‘sexy’.[10](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-10) The\n_digitus_ is starting to play the part of the _phallus_.\n\n**Quantified Self**\n\nBelief that life admits measurement and quantification governs the digital age\nas a whole. ‘Quantified Self’ honours this faith too. The body is outfitted\nwith sensors that automatically register data. Measurements involve\ntemperature, blood sugar levels, calorie intake and use, movement profiles and\nfat content. The heart rate is taken in a state of meditation: performance and\nefficiency still count when relaxing. Moods, dispositions and routine\nactivities are all inventoried as well. Such self-measurement and self-\nmonitoring is supposed to enhance mental performance. Yet the mounting pile of\ndata this yields does nothing to answer the simple question, _Who am I?_\n‘Quantified Self’ represents a Dadaist technology too; it empties the self of\nany and all meaning. The self gets broken down into data until no sense\nremains.\n\nThe motto of Quantified Self is ‘Self Knowledge through Numbers’. But no\ninsight into the self can result from data and numbers alone, no matter how\nexhaustive they are. Numbers do not _recount_ anything about the self.\nCounting is not recounting. A sense of self derives from giving an _account_.\nIt is not counting, but recounting that leads to self-discovery or self-\nknowledge.\n\nIn antiquity, the care of the self was also tied to practices of self-\nobservation. _Publicatio sui_ (Tertullian) represented a significant component\nof paying due attention in this manner:\n\n> Writing was also important in the culture of taking care of oneself. One of\n> the main features of taking care involved taking notes on oneself to be\n> reread, writing treatises and letters to friends to help them, and keeping\n> notebooks in order to reactivate for oneself the truths one\n> needed.[11](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-11)\n\n_Publicatio sui_ meant committing to the search for truth. Records of one’s\nlife served an ethics of the self. In contrast, dataism’s self-tracking is\ndevoid of all _ethics_ and _truth_ ; it amounts simply to a _technology_ for\nself-monitoring. When the data collected is published and exchanged, self-\ntracking comes to resemble self-surveillance more and more. The subject of\ntoday’s world is an entrepreneur of the self practising self-exploitation –\nand, by the same token, self-surveillance. The auto-exploiting subject carries\naround its own labour camp; here, it is perpetrator and victim at one and the\nsame time. As a self-illuminating, self-surveilling subject, it bears its own,\ninternal panopticon within; here, there is no difference between guard and\ninmate. The digitalized, networked subject is a _panopticon of itself_. This\nensures that each and every person has now taken on the task of conducting\nperpetual auto-surveillance.\n\n**Life Logged in Full**\n\nToday, the clicks we make and the search words we type are stored. Every step\nis watched and recorded. A complete picture of our lives exists on the\ninternet. Our digital habitus provides an extremely precise likeness of our\npersons – of our very souls. Perhaps it is even fuller and more accurate than\nthe images we otherwise make of ourselves.\n\nThe number of web addresses now available is practically unlimited. As such,\nany item of use can be given its own internet address. Objects themselves are\nstarting to transmit information. They report on our lives, activities and\nhabits. The expansion of Web 2.0, the internet of persons, to Web 3.0, the\ninternet of things, is bringing digital control society to completion. Web 3.0\nhas made it possible to log life in every aspect. Now, the very things we use\nevery day are also surveilling us.\n\nWe are caught, so to speak, in the total memory of the Digital. Bentham’s\npanopticon still lacked an efficient recording system; it had only a\n‘punishment log’ for penalties enacted and the reasons they occurred.\nPrisoners’ actual lives were not taken down. Big Brother had no way of knowing\nwhat inmates really thought or desired. In contrast to Big Brother, who could\nbe quite forgetful, Big Data never forgets anything at all. For this reason\nalone, the digital panopticon is much more efficient than Bentham’s.\n\nIndeed, in US elections, Big Data and data-mining have proven to be Columbus’s\negg. Candidates obtain a 360-degree view of voters. Enormous masses of data\nare gathered from various sources – bought, in fact – and connected to each\nother in such a way that highly precise voter profiles result. In the process,\nclients also gain insight into voters’ private lives and their very psyche.\nThrough _micro-targeting_ , personalized messages are devised to address and\n_influence_ voters. As the practical microphysics of power, micro-targeting is\n_data-driven psychopolitics_. Likewise, intelligent algorithms make it\npossible to predict voting behaviour and optimize candidates’ appeal.\nIndividually calibrated messages to voters are hardly any different than\npersonalized advertisements. More and more, voting and buying, the state and\nthe market, citizens and consumers are coming to resemble each other. Micro-\ntargeting is becoming the standard practice of psychopolitics.\n\nThe census, which represents a _biopolitical_ practice of disciplinary\nsociety, provides material that may be used _demographically_ , but not\n_psychologically_. Biopolitics is incapable of enabling subtle interventions\nin the psyche. In contrast, digital psychopolitics manages to intervene in\npsychic processes in a prospective fashion. Quite possibly, it is even\n_faster_ than free will. As such, it could overtake it. If so, this would\nherald the _end of freedom_.[12](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-12)\n\n**The Digital Unconscious**\n\nIt is possible that Big Data can even read desires we do not know we harbour.\nAfter all, under certain circumstances we develop inclinations that elude\nconsciousness. Often, we do not even know why we suddenly experience a certain\nneed. For instance, at a given stage of pregnancy, a woman may crave a\nparticular product – yet this impulse marks a correlation of which she remains\nunaware. She buys the item, but she doesn’t know why. _That’s how it is_.\nConceivably, this _that’s-how-it-is_ (_Es-ist-so_) exists in psychic proximity\nto the Freudian _id_ (_Es_), which escapes the ego and consciousness. In this\nlight, Big Data is making _the id into an ego_ to be exploited\npsychopolitically. If Big Data has access to the realm of our unconscious\nactions and inclinations, it is possible to construct a psychopolitics that\nwould reach deep into our psyche to exploit it.\n\nAccording to Walter Benjamin, the movie camera affords access to the ‘optical\nunconscious’:\n\n> With the close-up, space expands; with slow motion, movement is extended …\n> clearly, it is another nature which speaks to the camera as compared to the\n> eye. ‘Other’ above all in the sense that a space informed by human\n> consciousness gives way to a space informed by the unconscious … We are\n> familiar with the movement of picking up a cigarette lighter or a spoon, but\n> know almost nothing of what really goes on between hand and metal, and still\n> less how this varies with different moods. This is where the camera comes\n> into play, with all its resources for swooping and rising, disrupting and\n> isolating, stretching or compressing a sequence, enlarging or reducing an\n> object. It is through the camera that we first discover the optical\n> unconscious, just as we discover the instinctual unconscious through\n> psychoanalysis.[13](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-13)\n\nOne may understand Big Data in analogy to a movie camera. As a digital\nmagnifying glass, data-mining would enlarge the picture of human actions;\nbehind the framework of consciousness it would then disclose another scene\nshot through with unconscious elements. Big Data’s microphysics, then, would\nmake _actomes_ visible – that is, _micro-actions_ that elude detection by the\nwaking mind. Thus, Big Data could also bring to light collective patterns of\nbehaviour, of which individuals are unaware. This would render the _collective\nunconscious_ accessible. In analogy to the ‘optical unconscious’, one could\ncall such a microphysical or micropsychical web of relations the _digital\nunconscious_. As such, digital psychopolitics would be in the position to take\ncontrol of mass behaviour on a level that escapes detection.\n\n**Big Business**\n\nToday, Big Data is not just taking the stage as _Big Brother_ – it is also\ntaking the form of _Big Business_. First and foremost, Big Data is a vast,\ncommercial enterprise. Here, personal data are unceasingly monetized and\ncommercialized. Now, people are treated and traded as packages of data for\neconomic use. That is, human beings have become a commodity. Big Brother and\nBig Business have formed an alliance. The surveillance state and the market\nare merging.\n\nAcxiom is a company trading in the personal data of about 300 million US\ncitizens – in other words, practically all of them. By now, Acxiom knows more\nabout Americans than the FBI. The company divides people into seventy\ncategories. In the catalogue, they are offered up like goods for sale. For any\nneed, there is something to buy. People with a low economic value are\ndesignated as ‘waste’ – that is, ‘trash’. Consumers with a higher market value\nare found in the group ‘Shooting Star’. From ages thirty-six to forty-five\nthey are dynamic, get up early to go jogging, have no children but are\nmarried, like to travel, and watch _Seinfeld_.\n\nBig Data is leading to the emergence of a new _digital class society_. Human\nbeings assigned to the ‘waste’ category belong to the lowest class. People\nwith a bad score are denied credit. Thus, the panopticon has been joined by a\n‘ban-opticon’.[14](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-14) The panopticon kept watch over\nprisoners of the system who were incarcerated. The ban-opticon, on the other\nhand, is a dispositive that identifies persons who stand outside the system or\nare hostile to it, and _excludes them_. The classical panopticon served to\ndiscipline. In contrast, the ban-opticon ensures the system’s security and\nefficiency.\n\nThe digital ban-opticon identifies human beings without economic value as\nwaste. Waste is something to be eliminated:\n\n> They are all redundant. The rejects or refuse of society. To sum up, waste.\n> ‘Waste’, by definition, is the antonym of ‘utility’; it denotes objects\n> without possible use. Indeed, the sole accomplishment of waste is soiling\n> and cluttering up the space that could otherwise be usefully employed. The\n> principal purpose of the ban-opticon is to make sure that the waste is\n> separated from decent product and earmarked for transportation to a refuse\n> tip.[15](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-15)\n\n**Forgetting**\n\nHuman memory is a narrative, an account; forgetting forms a necessary\ncomponent. In contrast, digital memory is a matter of seamless addition and\naccumulation. Stored data admit counting, but they cannot be recounted.\nStorage and retrieval are fundamentally different from remembering, which is a\nnarrative process. Likewise, autobiography constitutes a narrative: it is\nmemorial writing. A timeline, on the other hand, recounts nothing. It simply\nenumerates and adds up events or information.\n\nMemory constitutes a dynamic, living process; here, different levels of time\nintersect and influence each other. Memory is subject to constant rewriting\nand rearrangement. Freud understood human memory as a living organism too:\n\n> As you know, I am working on the assumption that our psychic mechanism has\n> come into being by a process of stratification: the material present in the\n> form of memory traces being subjected from time to time to a _rearrangement_\n> in accordance with fresh circumstances – to a _retranscription_. Thus what\n> is essentially new about my theory is the thesis that memory is present not\n> once but several times over, that it is laid down in various kinds of\n> indications.[16](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-16)\n\nIn other words, _the_ past – as something that remains self-identical and is\nalways to be retrieved in the same form – does not exist. Digital memory\nconsists of indifferent – as it were, _undead_ – points of presence. It lacks\nthe extended horizon constituting the _temporality of the living_. This means\nthat digitalized life lacks animacy. Digital temporality belongs to the\nundead.\n\n**Spirit**\n\nBig Data opens up the prospect of absolute knowledge. Everything can be\nmeasured and quantified; the things of the world reveal correlations that were\npreviously hidden. Even human behaviour is supposed to admit exact prediction.\nA new age of insight is being announced. Correlations are replacing causality.\n_That’s-how-it-is_ stands where _How so?_ once wavered. The data-driven\nquantification of reality is driving _Spirit_ from the realm of knowledge.\n\nHegel, the philosopher of Spirit, would deem the omniscience (_All-Wissen_)\nthat Big Data promises to be absolute ignorance (_Un-Wissen_). Hegel’s _Logic_\nmay also be read as the logic of knowledge. Here, correlation represents the\nmost primitive level. A strong correlation between A and B means that if A\nchanges, a change also occurs in B. But when a correlation holds – however\nstrong it may be – one still does not know _why_ this is the case. It _just is\nthat way_. Correlation represents a relation of probability, not of necessity.\nIt declares: A _often_ occurs together with B. That is the difference between\ncorrelation and causation, which is distinguished by necessity: _A causes B_.\n\nBut causality does not stand at the highest level of knowledge. Reciprocity\n(_Wechselwirkung_) represents a more complex relation than causal relation. It\ndeclares: A and B condition each other mutually. A necessary connection holds\nbetween A and B. And yet, even at the level of reciprocity, the overarching\ncontext for the connection between A and B has not yet been grasped, i.e.,\n_conceived_ (_begriffen_): ‘If we stop at considering a given content just\nfrom the point of view of reciprocal action, we are in fact proceeding quite\nunconceptually.’[17](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-17)\n\nOnly the ‘Concept’ brings forth knowledge. The Concept is C, which\n_comprehends within itself_ (_in sich begreift_) A and B – here, A and B are\nfirst _conceived_ (_begriffen_). The concept is the higher context surrounding\nA and B, which provides the foundation (_Begründung_) for the relationship\nbetween A and B. Thus, A and B stand as ‘moments of a third, higher\n[whole]’.[18](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-18) _Knowledge_ becomes possible only at\nthe level of the Concept: ‘The Concept dwells within the things themselves, it\nis that through which they become what they are, and to comprehend an object\nmeans therefore to become conscious of its\nconcept.’[19](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-19) Only from the all-comprehending\n_Concept_ C is complete _comprehension_ (_Begreifen_) of the correlation\nbetween A and B possible. In contrast, Big Data affords only extremely\nrudimentary knowledge, that is, correlations in which nothing is\n_comprehended_. Big Data lacks _comprehension_ – it lacks the _Concept_ – and\nthus it _lacks Spirit_. The absolute knowledge intimated by Big Data coincides\nwith absolute ignorance.\n\nThe Concept is a unity that _in-cludes_ (_ein-schließt_) and _com-prises_\n(_ein-begreift_) the elements of the whole that it is. It takes the form of a\n_conclusion_ (_Schluss_) in which everything is _comprised_ and\n_comprehended_. ‘Everything is a syllogism (_Schluss_)’ means ‘Everything is a\n_concept_.’[20](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-20) Absolute knowledge is an absolute\nsyllogism: everything takes _conclusive_ form within it. The _‘definition of\nthe Absolute’_ is ‘that it is the syllogism’[21](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-21) –\ni.e., the conclusion. But constant _addition_ yields no conclusion, no\nsyllogism, no ‘putting-together’. Syllogism is not _addition_ , but\n_narration_. The absolute con-clusion _ex-cludes_ any further addition. As\nnarration, syllogism represents the opposite of addition. Big Data is purely\nadditive; it never comes to an end, to a conclusion. In contrast to the\ncorrelations and additions that Big Data generates, theoretical thinking\nrepresents a _narrative form of knowledge_.\n\nThe Spirit is a conclusion, a syllogism, an integral whole in which component\nparts are meaningfully _preserved_ (_aufgehoben_). The integral whole is a\nconclusive form. But without Spirit, the whole world falls apart into merely\nadditive, unincorporated elements. Spirit constitutes the world’s\n_interiority_ (_Innerlichkeit_) and _composure_ (_Sammlung_): what gathers, or\n_composes_ (_versammelt_), everything within itself. Theory is also conceptual\n– syllogistic – because it _comprehends_ all the elements it _includes_.\nUltimately, the ‘end of theory’ that Chris Anderson has trumpeted means\n_taking leave of Spirit_. Big Data makes Spirit – that is, thinking and\nthought – wither and die. Human science – _Geisteswissenschaft_ – that is\npurely data-driven is, in fact, no longer human; it has no _Geist_ , or\nSpirit. _Totalized data-knowledge amounts to absolute ignorance: the absolute\nzero of Spirit_.\n\nThe _Science of Logic_ declares: ‘The syllogism is what is _rational_ , and it\nis _everything_ that is rational’[22](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-22) – it is a\nconclusion, or _Schluss_. For Hegel, the syllogism is not a category of formal\nlogic. A syllogism follows when the beginning and end of a process form a\nmeaningful set of relations – a unity that makes sense. Unlike mere addition,\nthen, narration is a syllogism. _Knowledge_ – the state of _knowing_ – is a\nsyllogism. Rituals and ceremonies are syllogistic forms too. They represent a\nnarrative process. As such, they have their own temporality, their own rhythm\nand pace. As narratives, they defy acceleration. But when all syllogistic\nforms fall apart, everything dissolves; nothing has a _stay_. In a world where\neverything has become additive, where all narrative tension – any vertical\ntautness – has gone missing, total acceleration sets in.\n\nToday, our perceptive apparatus itself is incapable of arriving at any\nconclusion: it just clicks its way through the endless, digital net. Our\nsenses are completely distracted. Yet only contemplative lingering manages to\nachieve any meaningful end. _Shutting one’s eyes_ offers a symbol for arriving\nat a conclusion. Abrupt change from image to image, from information to\ninformation, has made any such contemplative conclusion impossible. If all\nthat qualifies as reasonable is a syllogism – a conclusion – then our era, the\nage of Big Data, is an _epoch without reason_.\n\n**The Event**\n\nWhen the statistical method was discovered in the seventeenth century, it\ncaptivated scientists, gamblers, poets and philosophers alike.\nEnthusiastically, they embraced statistical probability and regularity. There\ncan be no doubt that such euphoria admits comparison with the fortunes of Big\nData today. _Then_ , statistics inspired renewed trust in a higher power for\npeople as they confronted the contingencies of the world. For instance, an\neighteenth-century treatise by John Arbuthnot was called _An Argument for\nDivine Providence, taken from the Regularity observ’d in the British Births of\nboth Sexes_. On the basis of the statistically determined predominance of male\ninfants relative to female ones, philosophers saw the hand of God at work –\nand found further reason to justify war.\n\nEven Kant got carried away by the possibilities that statistical calculation\nafforded; he incorporated the lawful order it allowed him to discern into his\nteleological view of history. On the one hand, he posited the existence of\nfree will. On the other, he restricted it. Kant affirmed that phenomena of\nfree will – that is, human actions – are determined by general laws of nature,\nlike every other natural fact. If one considers the play of freedom in human\nwill ‘on a large scale’, lawfulness may be discerned. As unruly as the conduct\nof individual subjects seems to be, a ‘steady progression though slow\ndevelopment of … original predispositions’ is recognizable at the level of the\nspecies. To make this point, Kant refers to statistics:\n\n> Thus marriages, the births that come from them and deaths, since the free\n> will of human beings has so great an influence on them, seem to be subject\n> to no rule in accordance with which their number could be determined in\n> advance through calculation; and yet the annual tables of them in large\n> countries prove that they happen just as much in accordance with constant\n> laws of nature, as weather conditions which are so inconstant, whose\n> individual occurrence one cannot previously determine, but which on the\n> whole do not fail to sustain the growth of plants, the course of streams,\n> and other natural arrangements in a uniform uninterrupted course. Individual\n> human beings and even whole nations think little about the fact, since while\n> each pursues its own aim in its own way and one often contrary to the other,\n> they are proceeding unnoticed, as by a guiding thread, according to an aim\n> of nature, which is unknown to them, and are laboring at its\n> promotion.[23](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-23)\n\nIn essence, the first Enlightenment was committed to belief in statistical\nknowledge. Rousseau’s _volonté générale_ results from statistical-mathematic\noperations too. The general will takes form _without any communication at\nall_.[24](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-24) It results from statistical averages:\n\n> There is often a considerable difference between the will of all and the\n> general will: the latter looks only to the common interest, the former looks\n> to private interest, and is nothing but a sum of particular wills; but if,\n> from these same wills, one takes away the pluses and the minuses which\n> cancel each other out, what is left as the sum of the differences is the\n> general will.[25](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-25)\n\nRousseau stresses that arriving at the general will requires no communication;\nindeed, it excludes it. Communication distorts statistical objectivity.\nAccordingly, he would like to prohibit political parties and associations. The\ndemocracy he envisions is democracy without discourse or communication.\nProceeding statistically is supposed to yield a synthesis of quantity and\ntruth.[26](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-26) Rousseau offers a biopolitical response\nto the question of the features defining a good government. He avoids\napproaching the question morally. For him, the purpose of a political\nassociation is simply the protection and welfare of its members. The surest\nsign of success is the increase of population. Unquestionably, for him, the\nbest government is the one in which the citizens ‘become populous and multiply\nthe most’. Thus, he sounds the call: ‘Calculators, it is now up to you: count,\nmeasure, compare.’[27](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-27)\n\nToday’s euphoria about Big Data strongly resembles the euphoria about\nstatistics in the eighteenth century – which did not last for long, however.\nStatistics was surely the Big Data of the eighteenth century. Before long,\nresistance mounted against statistical reason – above all, on the part of\nRomanticism. The fundamental affect of Romanticism is horror at everything\naverage and normal. The singular, improbable and sudden stand opposed to what\nis merely probable in statistical terms. Romanticism cultivated the\noutlandish, abnormal and the extreme in order to counter statistical\nnormality.[28](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-28)\n\nNietzsche also shared this abhorrence for statistical reason:\n\n> Statistics proves that there are laws in history. Yes, it proves how vulgar\n> and disgustingly uniform the masses are. You should have kept statistics in\n> Athens! Then you would have sensed the difference! The more inferior and un-\n> individual the masses are, the more rigorous the statistical law. If the\n> multitude has a more refined and nobler composition, then the law\n> immediately goes to the devil. And way up at the top, where the great minds\n> are, you no longer can make any calculations at all: when, for example, have\n> great artists ever gotten married! You are hopeless, you who want to\n> discover a law in this. Thus, to the extent that there are laws in history,\n> they are worthless, and history itself – that is, everything that has\n> occurred – is worthless.[29](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-29)\n\nStatistics does not take into consideration ‘great active individuals on the\nstage of history, but only … the supernumeraries\n[_Statisten_]’.[30](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-30) Nietzsche inveighs against a\nversion of history ‘that takes the great drives of the masses to be what is\nimportant and that views all great men merely as their expression, as the\nbubbles that become visible on the surface of the\nflood’.[31](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-31)\n\nFor Nietzsche, the figures of statistics prove only that man is a herd animal.\nHe observes that ‘die Menschen _zunehmen_ im _Gleichwerden_\n’.[32](20_Notes.xhtml#ch11-fn-32) This means both that ‘people are\nincreasingly growing equal’ and that ‘people _batten_ [i.e., grow fat] as they\n_become the same_.’ Such _Gleichschaltung_ also characterizes our contemporary\nsociety of transparency and information. When everything is made visible at\nonce, deviations can scarcely occur. Transparency entails a compulsion to\nconform, which eliminates the Other, the Alien and the Deviant. Above all, Big\nData makes collective patterns of behaviour visible. Dataism is augmenting\n_Zunehmen im Gleichwerden_ , or hypertrophied sameness. Data-mining does not\ndiffer from statistics in any fundamental way. The correlations it lays bare\nrepresent only what is likely in statistical terms. It calculates average\nvalues. As such, Big Data has no access to what is unique. Big Data is wholly\n_blind to the event_. Not what is statistically likely, but what is unlikely –\nthe _singular_ , the _event_ – will shape history, in other words, the\n_future_ of mankind. Thus, Big Data is _blind to the future_ too.\n\n\n## [12.](05_Contents.xhtml#s12)\n\n## [Beyond the Subject](05_Contents.xhtml#s12)\n\nWhat Nietzsche refers to as the ‘naturification’ (_Vernatürlichung_) of the\nhuman being includes ‘readiness for what is absolutely sudden and thwarting\n(_das absolut Plötzliche und Durchkreuzende_)’.[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch12-fn-1)\nThe _event_ , which annuls what has held until now – the standing order –\nproves just as incalculable and abrupt as a _natural disaster_ or _act of\nGod_. It defies all calculation and prediction. When it occurs, an _entirely\nnew state of affairs_ begins. The _event_ brings into play an _outside_ ,\nwhich breaks the subject open and wrests it from subjection. Events represent\nbreaks and discontinuities; they open up _new spaces for action_.\n\nFollowing Nietzsche’s lead, Foucault also advances a conception of history\nthat ‘deals with events in terms of their most unique characteristics, their\nmost acute manifestations’.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch12-fn-2) ‘Event’, for\nFoucault, means ‘the reversal of a relationship of forces, the usurpation of\npower, the appropriation of a vocabulary against those who had once used\nit’.[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch12-fn-3) When an event occurs, one _suddenly_ speaks\n_another language_. It entails a _break_ with all _certainty that has held\nuntil now_ inasmuch as it _calls_ to life a wholly different constellation of\nBeing. Events are turns (_Kehren_), where a reversal – an overthrow – of\ndomination occurs. The event means that something takes _place_ – something\nthat was wholly absent from conditions beforehand.\n\nIn contrast to _experiencing_ (_Erlebnis_), _experience_ (_Erfahrung_) is\nfounded on discontinuity. Experience means transformation. In an interview,\nFoucault remarked that for Nietzsche, Blanchot and Bataille, _experience_ ‘has\nthe function of wrenching the subject from itself, of seeing to it that the\nsubject is no longer itself, or that it is brought to its annihilation or its\ndissolution’.[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch12-fn-4) Being a subject means being\nsubjected, being cast under, by a higher instance. _Experience_ tears the\nsubject out from subjection – out of its downcast state. It signifies the\nopposite of the neoliberal psychopolitics of _experiencing_ or _emotion_ ,\nwhich only ensnares the subject deeper and deeper in the state of subjection\nand subjugation.\n\nFollowing Foucault, the art of living may be understood as a practice of\nfreedom, bringing forth an entirely different mode of existence. It unfolds as\nde-psychologization: ‘The art of living is the art of killing psychology, of\ncreating with oneself and with others unnamed individualities, beings,\nrelations, qualities. If one can’t manage to do that in one’s life, that life\nis not worth living.’[5](20_Notes.xhtml#ch12-fn-5) The art of living stands\nopposed to the ‘psychological terror’ through which subjugating subjectivation\noccurs.\n\nNeoliberal psychopolitics is a technology of domination that stabilizes and\nperpetuates the prevailing system by means of psychological programming and\nsteering. Accordingly, the art of living, as the praxis of freedom, must\nproceed by way of de-psychologization. This serves to disarm psychopolitics,\nwhich is a means of effecting submission. When the subject is de-psychologized\n– indeed, _de-voided_ (_ent-leert_) – it opens onto a mode of existence that\nstill has no name: an unwritten future.\n\n\n## [13.](05_Contents.xhtml#s13)\n\n## [Idiotism](05_Contents.xhtml#s13)\n\nIn his 1980 course on Spinoza, Deleuze observed: ‘To the letter, I’d say they\nplay the fool [_ils font les idiots_]. Play the fool. Playing the fool, that’s\nalways been one function of philosophy.’[1](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-1) One of\nthe roles of philosophy is to play the fool, or idiot. From its inception,\nphilosophy has been closely tied to idiotism. Every philosopher who has\nbrought forth a new idiom – a new language, a new way of thinking – has\nnecessarily been an idiot. Only the idiot has access to the _wholly Other_.\nIdiotism discloses a _field of immanence of events and singularities_ for\nthought; this field eludes subjectivation and psychologization altogether.\n\nThe history of philosophy is a history of idiotisms. Socrates knows only that\nhe does not know; he is an idiot. Likewise, Descartes – who casts doubt on\neverything – is an idiot. _Cogito ergo sum_ is idiotic. It takes an inner\ncontraction of thinking to make a new beginning possible. Descartes _thinks_\nby _thinking Thought_ (_das Denken denkt_). By relating (only) to itself,\nThought regains a virginal state. Deleuze places the Cartesian idiot in\nopposition to an idiot of another kind:\n\n> The old idiot wanted indubitable truths at which he could arrive by himself:\n> in the meantime he would doubt everything … The new idiot has no wish for\n> indubitable truths; he … wills the absurd – this is not the same image of\n> thought. The old idiot wanted truth, but the new idiot wants to turn the\n> absurd into the highest power of thought.[2](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-2)\n\nToday, it seems, the type of the outsider – the idiot, the fool – has all but\nvanished from society. Thoroughgoing digital networking and communication have\nmassively amplified the compulsion to conform. The attendant violence of\nconsensus is suppressing idiotisms. Botho Strauss pinpoints the difference\nbetween contemporary conformism and bourgeois convention of old: ‘For him, the\nidiot, it’s as if everyone else were speaking in subtle attunement with each\nother: brought down to the most agreeable level [_verträglichsten\nStimmungsgrad_] … This is a far more implacable convention than any convention\nknown before, in bourgeois times.’[3](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-3)\n\nThe idiot is idiosyncratic. Literally, idiosyncrasy refers to a specific and\npeculiar mixture of the body’s humours and the oversensitivity this entails.\nWhen communication is to be accelerated, idiosyncrasy poses an obstacle\ninasmuch as it amounts to an immunological defence against the Other.\nIdiosyncrasy stands in the way of unbounded communicative exchange.\nAccordingly, immunosuppression is necessary for acceleration to proceed. But\nnow, immune responses are subjected to massive suppression so that information\nwill circulate faster and capital will accelerate. Communication achieves\nmaximum velocity when the Same reacts to the Same. In contrast, the resistance\nand recalcitrance of otherness, of foreignness, troubles and impedes the\nsmooth communication of the Same. In the _Inferno of the Same_ , communication\nattains its highest speed.\n\nIn light of compulsive and coercive communication and conformism, idiotism\nrepresents a practice of freedom. By nature, the idiot is unallied, un-\nnetworked, and uninformed. The idiot inhabits the _immemorial outside_ , which\nescapes communication and networking altogether: ‘The idiot spins about like a\nplucked rose in the whirling river of single-minded people – people in\nconsent, those who have been incorporated and belong to a wondrous, common\nunderstanding.’[4](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-4)\n\nThe idiot is a modern-day heretic. Etymologically, _heresy_ means ‘choice’.\nThus, the heretic is one who commands _free choice_ : the courage to deviate\nfrom orthodoxy. As a heretic, the idiot represents a figure of resistance\nopposing the violence of consensus. The idiot preserves the magic of the\noutsider. Today, in light of increasingly coercive conformism, it is more\nurgent than ever to heighten _heretical consciousness_.\n\nIdiotism stands opposed to the neoliberal power of domination: total\ncommunication and total surveillance. The idiot does not ‘communicate’.\nIndeed, he communicates with the In-communicable. As such, the idiot veils\nhimself in silence. Idiotism erects _spaces for guarding silence_ (_Freiräume\ndes Schweigens_), _quiet, and solitude_ , where it is still possible to say\nwhat really deserves to be said. Deleuze already called for such a _politics\nof silence_ in 1995. He directed it against neoliberal psychopolitics, which\nforces communication and disclosure:\n\n> It’s not a problem of getting people to express themselves but of providing\n> little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find\n> something to say. Repressive forces don’t stop people from expressing\n> themselves but rather force them to express themselves. What a relief to\n> have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a\n> chance of framing the rare, and ever rarer, thing that might be worth\n> saying.[5](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-5)\n\nThe _idiot savant_ has access to knowledge of a different order. He raises\nhimself above the horizontal plane – above _merely being informed and\nnetworked_. ‘The term _idiot savant_ , as the autistic first were called,\nshould perhaps be freed up and used for those adventurers who are not simply\ntied to one another, but to something else [_für jene Abenteurer, die anders\nverbunden sind als nur untereinander_].’[6](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-6) Idiotism\nopens up virginal space – forging the distance required by thought so that\nspeaking may occur in an entirely different manner. The _idiot savant_ lives\nfrom the faraway – like a stylite. Vertical tension enables him to find\n_higher agreement_ : receptivity to _events, broadcasts_ (_Sendungen_) _from\nthe future_ : ‘Stylite, pillar dweller, antenna. The waves of the overflowing\nmessage generate, in the mouth of the holy man, the same noise [_Rauschen_] as\nthe faint signals the idiot receives from the\nworld.’[7](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-7)\n\nIntelligence means _choosing-between_ (_inter-legere_). It is not entirely\nfree in so far as it is caught in a _between_ , which depends on the system in\noperation. Intelligence has no access to _outside_ , because it makes a choice\nbetween options in a system. Therefore, intelligence does not really exercise\n_free choice_ : it can only _select_ among the offerings the system affords.\nIntelligence follows the logic of a system. It is system-immanent. A given\nsystem defines a given intelligence. Accordingly, intelligence has no access\nto what is _wholly Other_. It inhabits a horizontal plane. In contrast, the\nidiot has contact with the vertical dimension inasmuch as he takes leave of\nthe prevailing system – that is, abandons intelligence. ‘The inside of idiocy\nis delicate and transparent, like a dragonfly’s wing – it glistens with\nintelligence that has been overcome.’[8](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-8)\n\nIn his final work – _Pure Immanence: Essays on a Life_ – Deleuze elevates\nimmanence to a formula for beatitude: ‘We will say of pure immanence that it\nis A LIFE, and nothing else. It is not immanence to life, but the immanent\nthat is in nothing is itself a life. A life is the immanence of immanence,\nabsolute immanence: it is complete power, complete\nbliss.’[9](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-9) Immanence is something immanent that ‘is\nin nothing’ because it does not occur in something else – it exists only in\nitself. As such, it is the ‘immanence of immanence’. It is _subject_ to\nnothing; rather, it is self-sufficient. No order of domination can be erected\non this level of life’s immanence (_Immanenzebene des Lebens_). In contrast,\nCapital manifests itself as transcendence: it estranges life from itself.\n_Immanence as life_ suspends this alienating relationship.\n\nPure immanence is the _void_ , which can neither be psychologized nor\nsubjectivized. Immanent life is _lighter and richer – indeed, freer_ – for\nsuch emptiness.[10](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-10) The idiot is not defined by\nindividuality or subjectivity, but by singularity. As such, the idiot is\nsimilar in nature to the child, who is not yet an individual, not yet a\nperson. The child’s existence is not determined by individual qualities so\nmuch as impersonal _events_ :\n\n> For example, very small children all resemble one another and have hardly\n> any individuality, but they have singularities: a smile, a gesture, a funny\n> face – not subjective qualities. Small children, through all their\n> sufferings and weaknesses, are infused with an immanent life that is pure\n> power and even bliss.[11](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-11)\n\nThe idiot is like Deleuze’s _‘homo tantum’_ – one who ‘no longer has a name,\nthough he can be mistaken for no other’.[12](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-12) The\nsphere of immanence to which the idiot gains admittance is the matrix of de-\nsubjectivation and de-psychologization. It is _negativity_ , wresting the\nsubject out of itself and liberating it into the ‘immensity of an empty\ntime’.[13](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-13) The idiot does not exist as a subject –\nhe is ‘more like a flower: an existence simply open to\nlight’.[14](20_Notes.xhtml#ch13-fn-14)\n\n\n## [Notes](05_Contents.xhtml#s14)\n\n**1\\.

In his treatise on idiocy, Clément\nRosset explicitly distinguishes stupidity (_sottise_) from unintelligence\n(_inintelligence_). In so doing, he ascribes a creative potential to\nstupidity: ‘Stupidity … is generally assimilated to unintelligence, which is\ndeemed the opposite of intelligence. This means opposing _attentive, nimble_ ,\nand _alert_ intelligence to stupidity, which is understood as _sluggish,\nanesthetic_ , and _mummified_ … In fact, there is nothing so _attentive,\nnimble_ , and _alert_ as stupidity’ (_Le Réel. Traité de l’idiotie_ [Paris:\nMinuit, 1977], 144). Boundless openness and receptivity distinguish stupidity,\nwhereas lack of intelligence means limitation. Unintelligence is poor in\nexperience. It has no access to the event: ‘Unintelligence closes doors: it\nsignals that certain paths of approach to such or such knowledge are\nprohibited, thereby narrowing the field of experience.’ In contrast,\n‘stupidity opens onto everything: it makes anything at all into an object of\nnotice and possible engagement.’ It is a ‘calling, or better, a priesthood,\nwith its idols, officiants, and faithful’ (145).\n\n[9](19_Chapter13.xhtml#ch13-fn_9)Gilles Deleuze, _Pure Immanence: Essays on a\nLife_ , trans.
