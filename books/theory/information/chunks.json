The notes are explanatory bits\nthat didn't make it into the main text. These are indicated by superscript\nnumbers in both the paper and e-book formats. The references are not indicated\nat all in the main text; they are collected at the back of the book, organized\nby printed page number and a bit of quoted text.\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nOverview\n\nJust today, a stranger came to my door claiming he was here to unclog a\nbathroom drain. I let him into my house without verifying his identity, and\nnot only did he repair the drain, he also took off his shoes so he wouldn't\ntrack mud on my floors. When he was done, I gave him a piece of paper that\nasked my bank to give him some money. He accepted it without a second glance.\nAt no point did he attempt to take my possessions, and at no point did I\nattempt the same of him. In fact, neither of us worried that the other would.\nMy wife was also home, but it never occurred to me that he was a sexual rival\nand I should therefore kill him.\n\nAlso today, I passed several strangers on the street without any of them\nattacking me. I bought food from a grocery store, not at all concerned that it\nmight be unfit for human consumption. I locked my front door, but didn't spare\na moment's worry at how easy it would be for someone to smash my window in.\nEven people driving cars, large murderous instruments that could crush me like\na bug, didn't scare me.\n\nMost amazingly, this worked without much overt security. I don't carry a gun\nfor self-defense, nor do I wear body armor. I don't use a home burglar alarm.\nI don't test my food for poison. I don't even engage in conspicuous displays\nof physical prowess to intimidate other people I encounter.\n\nIt's what we call “trust.” Actually, it's what we call “civilization.”\n\nAll complex ecosystems, whether they are biological ecosystems like the human\nbody, natural ecosystems like a rain forest, social ecosystems like an open-\nair market, or socio-technical ecosystems like the global financial system or\nthe Internet, are deeply interlinked. Individual units within those ecosystems\nare interdependent, each doing its part and relying on the other units to do\ntheir parts as well. This is neither rare nor difficult, and complex\necosystems abound.\n\nAt the same time, all complex ecosystems [contain\nparasites](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1070622).\nWithin every interdependent system, there are individuals who try to subvert\nthe system to their own ends. These could be tapeworms in our digestive\ntracts, thieves in a bazaar, robbers disguised as plumbers, spammers on the\nInternet, or companies that move their profits offshore to evade taxes.\n\nWithin complex systems, there is a fundamental tension between what I'm going\nto call cooperating, or acting in the group interest; and what I'll call\ndefecting, or acting against the group interest and instead in one's own self-\ninterest. Political philosophers have recognized this antinomy since Plato. We\nmight individually want each other's stuff, but we're collectively better off\nif everyone respects property rights and no one steals. We might individually\nwant to reap the benefits of government without having to pay for them, but\nwe're collectively better off if everyone pays taxes. Every country might want\nto be able to do whatever it wants, but the world is better off with\ninternational agreements, treaties, and organizations. In general, we're\ncollectively better off if society limits individual behavior, and we'd each\nbe better off if those limits didn't apply to us individually. That doesn't\nwork, of course, and most of us recognize this. Most of the time, we realize\nthat it is in our self-interest to act in the group interest. But because\nparasites will always exist—because some of us steal, don't pay our taxes,\nignore international agreements, or ignore limits on our behavior—we also need\nsecurity.\n\nSociety runs on trust. We all need to trust that the random people we interact\nwith will cooperate. Not trust completely, not trust blindly, but be\nreasonably sure (whatever that means) that our trust is well-founded and they\nwill be trustworthy in return (whatever that means). This is vital. If the\nnumber of parasites gets too large, if too many people steal or too many\npeople don't pay their taxes, society no longer works. It doesn't work both\nbecause there is so much theft that people can't be secure in their property,\nand because even the honest become suspicious of everyone else. More\nimportantly, it doesn't work because the social contract breaks down: society\nis no longer seen as providing the required benefits. Trust is largely habit,\nand when there's not enough trust to be had, people stop trusting each other.\n\nThe devil is in the details. In all societies, for example, there are\ninstances where property is legitimately taken from one person and given to\nanother: taxes, fines, fees, confiscation of contraband, theft by a legitimate\nbut despised ruler, etc. And a societal norm like “everyone pays his or her\ntaxes” is distinct from any discussion about what sort of tax code is fair.\nBut while we might disagree about the extent of the norms we subject ourselves\nto—that's what politics is all about—we're collectively better off if we all\nfollow them.\n\nOf course, it's actually more complicated than that. A person might decide to\nbreak the norms, not for selfish parasitical reasons, but because his moral\ncompass tells him to. He might help escaped slaves flee into Canada because\nslavery is wrong. He might refuse to pay taxes because he disagrees with what\nhis government is spending his money on. He might help laboratory animals\nescape because he believes animal testing is wrong. He might shoot a doctor\nwho performs abortions because he believes abortion is wrong. And so on.\n\nSometimes we decide a norm breaker did the right thing. Sometimes we decide\nthat he did the wrong thing. Sometimes there's consensus, and sometimes we\ndisagree. And sometimes those who dare to defy the group norm become catalysts\nfor social change. Norm breakers rioted against the police raids of the\nStonewall Inn in New York in 1969, at the beginning of the gay rights\nmovement. Norm breakers hid and saved the lives of Jews in World War II\nEurope, organized the Civil Rights bus protests in the American South, and\nassembled in unlawful protest at Tiananmen Square. When the group norm is\nlater deemed immoral, history may call those who refused to follow it heroes.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. real estate industry collapsed, almost taking the global\neconomy with it. The causes of the disaster are complex, but were in a large\npart caused by financial institutions and their employees subverting financial\nsystems to their own ends. They wrote mortgages to homeowners who couldn't\nafford them, and then repackaged and resold those mortgages in ways that\nintentionally hid real risk. Financial analysts, who made money rating these\nbonds, gave them high ratings to ensure repeat rating business.\n\nThis is an example of a failure of trust: a limited number of people were able\nto use the global financial system for their own personal gain. That sort of\nthing isn't supposed to happen. But it did happen. And it will happen again if\nsociety doesn't get better at both trust and security.\n\nFailures in trust have become global problems:\n\n  * The Internet brings amazing benefits to those who have access to it, but it also brings with it new forms of fraud. Impersonation fraud—now called identity theft—is both easier and more profitable than it was pre-Internet. Spam continues to undermine the usability of e-mail. Social networking sites deliberately make it hard for people to effectively manage [their own privacy](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1071069). And antagonistic behavior threatens almost every Internet community.\n\n  * Globalization has improved the lives of people in many countries, but with it came an increased threat of global terrorism. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 were a failure of trust, and so were the government overreactions in the decade following.\n\n  * The financial network allows anyone to do business with anyone else around the world; but easily hacked financial accounts mean there is enormous profit in fraudulent transactions, and easily hacked computer databases mean there is also a global market in (terrifyingly cheap) stolen credit card numbers and personal dossiers to enable those fraudulent transactions.\n\n  * Goods and services are now supplied worldwide at much lower cost, but with this change comes tainted foods, unsafe children's toys, and the outsourcing of data processing to countries with different laws.\n\n  * Global production also means more production, but with it comes environmental pollution. If a company discharges lead into the atmosphere—or chlorofluorocarbons, or nitrogen oxides, or carbon dioxide—that company gets all the benefit of cheaper production costs, but the environmental cost falls on everybody else on the planet.\n\nAnd it's not just global problems, of course. Narrower failures in trust are\nso numerous as to defy listing. Here are just a few examples:\n\n  * In 2009–2010, officials of Bell, California, [effectively looted](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1071411) the city's treasury, awarding themselves unusually high salaries, often for part-time work.\n\n  * Some early online games, such as Star Wars Galaxy Quest, collapsed due to [internal cheating](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1071974).\n\n  * The senior executives at companies such as WorldCom, Enron, and Adelphia inflated their companies' stock prices through fraudulent accounting practices, awarding themselves huge bonuses but destroying the companies in the process.\n\nWhat ties all these examples together is that the interest of society was in\nconflict with the interests of certain individuals within society. Society had\nsome normative behaviors, but failed to ensure that enough people cooperated\nand followed those behaviors. Instead, the defectors within the group became\ntoo large or too powerful or too successful, and ruined it for everyone.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThis book is about trust. Specifically, it's about trust within a group. It's\nimportant that defectors not take advantage of the group, but it's also\nimportant for everyone in the group to trust that defectors won't take\nadvantage.\n\n“Trust” is a complex concept, and has a lot of flavors of meaning. Sociologist\nPiotr Sztompka wrote that “[trust is a\nbet](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1072331) about\nthe future contingent actions of others.” Political science professor Russell\nHardin wrote: “[Trust\ninvolves](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1072639)\ngiving discretion to another to affect one's interests.” These definitions\nfocus on trust between individuals and, by extension, their\ntrustworthiness.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos890427)\n\nWhen we trust people, we can either trust their intentions or their actions.\nThe first is more intimate. When we say we trust a friend, that trust isn't\ntied to any particular thing he's doing. It's a general reliance that,\nwhatever the situation, he'll do the right thing: that he's trustworthy. We\ntrust the friend's intentions, and know that his actions will be informed by\nthose\nintentions.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos890911)\n\nThe second is less intimate, what sociologist Susan Shapiro calls [impersonal\ntrust](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1072984). When\nwe don't know someone, we don't know enough about her, or her underlying\nmotivations, to trust her based on character alone. But we can trust her\nfuture\nactions.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos891716) We\ncan trust that she won't run red lights, or steal from us, or cheat on tests.\nWe don't know if she has a secret desire to run red lights or take our money,\nand we really don't care if she does. Rather, we know that she is likely to\nfollow most social norms of acceptable behavior because the consequences of\nbreaking these norms are high. You can think of this kind of trust—that people\nwill behave in a trustworthy manner even if they are not inherently\ntrustworthy—more as confidence, and the corresponding trustworthiness as\ncompliance.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos892271)\n\nIn another sense, we're reducing trust to consistency or predictability. Of\ncourse, someone who is consistent isn't necessarily trustworthy. If someone is\na habitual thief, I don't trust him. But I do believe (and, in another sense\nof the word, trust) that he will try to steal from me. I'm less interested in\nthat aspect of trust, and more in the positive aspects. In The Naked\nCorporation, business strategist Don Tapscott [described\ntrust](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1073342), at\nleast in business, as the expectation that the other party will be honest,\nconsiderate, accountable, and transparent. When two people are consistent in\nthis way, we call them cooperative.\n\nIn today's complex society, we often trust systems more than people. It's not\nso much that I trusted the plumber at my door as that I trusted the systems\nthat produced him and protect me. I trusted the recommendation from my\ninsurance company, the legal system that would protect me if he did rob my\nhouse, whatever the educational system is that produces and whatever insurance\nsystem bonds skilled plumbers, and—most of all—the general societal systems\nthat inform how we all treat each other in society. Similarly, I trusted the\nbanking system, the corporate system, the system of police, the system of\ntraffic laws, and the system of social norms that govern most\nbehaviors.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos892770)\n\nThis book is about trust more in terms of groups than individuals. I'm not\nreally concerned about how specific people come to trust other specific\npeople. I don't care if my plumber trusts me enough to take my check, or if I\ntrust that driver over there enough to cross the street at the stop sign. I'm\nconcerned with the general level of impersonal trust in society. Francis\nFukuyama's definition nicely captures the term as I want to use it: “[Trust is\nthe\nexpectation](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1073696)\nthat arises within a community of regular, honest, and cooperative behavior,\nbased on commonly shared norms, on the part of other members of that\ncommunity.”\n\nSociologist Barbara Misztal identified [three critical\nfunctions](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1074038)\nperformed by trust: 1) it makes social life more predictable, 2) it creates a\nsense of community, and 3) it makes it easier for people to work together. In\nsome ways, trust in society works like oxygen in the atmosphere. The more\ncustomers trust merchants, the easier commerce is. The more drivers trust\nother drivers, the smoother traffic flows. Trust gives people the confidence\nto deal with strangers: because they know that the strangers are likely to\nbehave honestly, cooperatively, fairly, and sometimes even altruistically. The\nmore trust is in the air, the healthier society is and the more it can thrive.\nConversely, the less trust is in the air, the sicker society is and the more\nit has to contract. And if the amount of trust gets too low, society withers\nand dies. A [recent\nexample](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1074388) of a\nsystemic breakdown in trust occurred in the Soviet Union under Stalin.\n\nI'm necessarily simplifying here. Trust is relative, fluid, and\nmultidimensional. I trust Alice to return a $10 loan but not a $10,000 loan,\nBob to return a $10,000 loan but not to babysit an infant, Carol to babysit\nbut not with my house key, Dave with my house key but not my intimate secrets,\nand Ellen with my intimate secrets but not to return a $10 loan. I trust Frank\nif a friend vouches for him, a taxi driver as long as he's displaying his\nlicense, and Gail as long as she hasn't been drinking. I don't trust anyone at\nall with my computer password. I trust my brakes to stop the car, ATM machines\nto dispense money from my account, and Angie's List to recommend a qualified\nplumber—even though I have no idea who designed, built, or maintained those\nsystems. Or even who Angie is. In the language of this book, we all need to\ntrust each other to follow the behavioral norms of our group.\n\nMany other books talk about the [value of\ntrust](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1074705) to\nsociety. This book explains how society establishes and maintains that\ntrust.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos894604)\nSpecifically, it explains how society enforces, evokes, elicits, compels,\nencourages—I'll use the term induces—trustworthiness, or at least compliance,\nthrough systems of what I call societal pressures, similar to sociology's\nsocial controls: coercive mechanisms that induce people to cooperate, act in\nthe group interest, and follow group norms. Like physical pressures, they\ndon't work in all cases on all people. But again, whether the pressures work\nagainst a particular person is less important than whether they keep the scope\nof defection to a manageable level across society as a whole.\n\nA manageable level, but not too low a level. Compliance isn't always good, and\ndefection isn't always bad. Sometimes the group norm doesn't deserve to be\nfollowed, and certain kinds of progress and innovation require violating\ntrust. In a police state, everybody is compliant but no one trusts anybody. A\ntoo-compliant society is a stagnant society, and defection contains the seeds\nof social change.\n\nThis book is also about security. Security is a type of a societal pressure in\nthat it induces cooperation, but it's different from the others. It is the\nonly pressure that can act as a physical constraint on behavior regardless of\nhow trustworthy people are. And it is the only pressure that individuals can\nimplement by themselves. In many ways, it obviates the need for intimate\ntrust. In another way, it is how we ultimately induce compliance and, by\nextension, trust.\n\nIt is essential that we learn to think smartly about trust. Philosopher\nSissela Bok wrote: “Whatever matters to human beings, [trust is the\natmosphere](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1075483)\nin which it thrives.” People, communities, corporations, markets, politics:\neverything. If we can figure out the optimal societal pressures to induce\ncooperation, we can reduce murder, terrorism, bank fraud, industrial\npollution, and all the rest.\n\nIf we get pressures wrong, the murder rate skyrockets, terrorists run amok,\nemployees routinely embezzle from their employers, and corporations lie and\ncheat at every turn. In extreme cases, an untrusting society breaks down. If\nwe get them wrong in the other direction, no one speaks out about\ninstitutional injustice, no one deviates from established corporate procedure,\nand no one popularizes new inventions that disrupt the status quo—an oppressed\nsociety stagnates. The very fact that the most extreme failures rarely happen\nin the modern industrial world is proof that we've largely gotten societal\npressures right. The failures that we've had show we have a lot further to go.\n\nAlso, as we'll see, evolution has left us with intuitions about trust better\nsuited to life as a savannah-dwelling primate than as a modern human in a\nglobal high-tech society. That flawed intuition is vulnerable to exploitation\nby companies, con men, politicians, and crooks. The only defense is a rational\nunderstanding of what trust in society is, how it works, and why it succeeds\nor fails.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThis book is divided into four parts. In Part I, I'll explore the background\nsciences of the book. Several fields of research—some closely related—will\nhelp us understand these topics: experimental psychology, evolutionary\npsychology, sociology, economics, behavioral economics, evolutionary biology,\nneuroscience, game theory, systems dynamics, anthropology, archaeology,\nhistory, political science, law, philosophy, theology, cognitive science, and\ncomputer security.\n\nAll these fields have something to teach us about trust and\nsecurity.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos894958)\nThere's a lot here, and delving into any of these areas of research could\neasily fill several books. This book attempts to gather and synthesize\ndecades, and sometimes centuries, of thinking, research, and experimentation\nfrom a broad swath of academic disciplines. It will, by necessity, be largely\na cursory overview; often, the hardest part was figuring out what not to\ninclude. My goal is to show where the broad arcs of research are pointing,\nrather than explain the details—though they're fascinating—of any individual\npiece of\nresearch.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos895334)\n\nIn the last chapter of Part I, I will introduce societal dilemmas. I'll\nexplain a thought experiment called the Prisoner's Dilemma, and its\ngeneralization to societal dilemmas. Societal dilemmas describe the situations\nthat require intra-group trust, and therefore use societal pressures to ensure\ncooperation: they're the central paradigm of my model. Societal dilemmas\nillustrate how society keeps defectors from taking advantage, taking over, and\ncompletely ruining society for everyone. It illustrates how society ensures\nthat its members forsake their own interests when they run counter to\nsociety's interest. Societal dilemmas have many names in the literature:\ncollective action problem, Tragedy of the Commons, free-rider problem, arms\nrace. We'll use them all.\n\nPart II fully develops my model. Trust is essential for society to function,\nand societal pressures are how we achieve it. There are four basic categories\nof societal pressure that can induce cooperation in societal dilemmas:\n\n  * Moral pressure. A lot of societal pressure comes from inside our own heads. Most of us don't steal, and it's not because there are armed guards and alarms protecting piles of stuff. We don't steal because we believe it's wrong, or we'll feel guilty if we do, or we want to follow the rules.\n\n  * Reputational pressure. A wholly different, and much stronger, type of pressure comes from how others respond to our actions. Reputational pressure can be very powerful; both individuals and organizations feel a lot of pressure to follow the group norms because they don't want a bad reputation.\n\n  * Institutional pressure. Institutions have rules and laws. These are norms that are codified, and whose enactment and enforcement is generally delegated. Institutional pressure induces people to behave according to the group norm by imposing sanctions on those who don't, and occasionally by rewarding those who do.\n\n  * Security systems. Security systems are another form of societal pressure. This includes any security mechanism designed to induce cooperation, prevent defection, induce trust, and compel compliance. It includes things that work to prevent defectors, like door locks and tall fences; things that interdict defectors, like alarm systems and guards; things that only work after the fact, like forensic and audit systems; and mitigation systems that help the victim recover faster and care less that the defection occurred.\n\nPart III applies the model to the more complex dilemmas that arise in the real\nworld. First I'll look at the full complexity of competing interests. It's not\njust group interest versus self-interest; people have a variety of competing\ninterests. Also, while it's easy to look at societal dilemmas as isolated\ndecisions, it's common for people to have conflicts of interest: multiple\ngroup interests and multiple societal dilemmas are generally operating at any\none time. And the effectiveness of societal pressures often depends on why\nsomeone is considering defecting.\n\nThen, I'll look at groups as actors in societal dilemmas: organizations in\ngeneral, corporations, and then institutions. Groups have different competing\ninterests, and societal pressures work differently when applied to them. This\nis an important complication, especially in the modern world of complex\ncorporations and government agencies. Institutions are also different. In\ntoday's world, it's rare that we implement societal pressures directly. More\noften, we delegate someone to do it for us. For example, we delegate our\nelected officials to pass laws, and they delegate some government agency to\nimplement those laws.\n\nIn Part IV, I'll talk about the different ways societal pressures fail. I'll\nlook at how changes in technology affect societal pressures, particularly\nsecurity. Then I'll look at the particular characteristics of today's\nsociety—the Information Society—and explain why that changes societal\npressures. I'll sketch what the future of societal pressures is likely to be,\nand close with the social consequences of too much societal pressure.\n\nThis book represents my attempt to develop a full-fledged theory of coercion\nand how it enables compliance and trust within groups. My goal is to suggest\nsome new questions and provide a new framework for analysis. I offer new\nperspectives, and a broader spectrum of what's possible. Perspectives frame\nthinking, and sometimes asking new questions is the catalyst to greater\nunderstanding. It's my hope that this book can give people an illuminating new\nframework with which to help understand how the world works.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nBefore we start, I need to define my terms. We talk about trust and security\nall the time, and the words we use tend to be overloaded with meaning. We're\ngoing to have to be more precise…and temporarily suspend our emotional\nresponses to what otherwise might seem like loaded, value-laden, even\ndisparaging, words.\n\nThe word society, as used in this book, isn't limited to traditional\nsocieties, but is any group of people with a loose common interest. It applies\nto societies of circumstance, like a neighborhood, a country, everyone on a\nparticular bus, or an ethnicity or social class. It applies to societies of\nchoice, like a group of friends, any membership organization, or a\nprofessional society. It applies to societies that are some of each: a\nreligion, a criminal gang, or all employees of a corporation. It applies to\nsocieties of all sizes, from a family to the entire planet. All of humanity is\na society, and everyone is a member of multiple societies. Some are based on\nbirth, and some are freely chosen. Some we can join, and to some we must be\ninvited. Some may be good, some may be bad—terrorist organizations, criminal\ngangs, a political party you don't agree with—and most are somewhere in\nbetween. For our purposes, a society is just a group of interacting actors\norganized around a common attribute.\n\nI said actors, not people. Most societies are made up of people, but sometimes\nthey're made up of groups of people. All the countries on the planet are a\nsociety. All corporations in a particular industry are a society. We're going\nto be talking about both societies of individuals and societies of groups.\n\nSocieties have a collection of group interests. These are the goals, or\ndirections, of the society. They're decided by the society in some way:\nperhaps formally—either democratically or autocratically—perhaps informally by\nthe group. International trade can be in the group interest. So can sharing\nfood, obeying traffic laws, and keeping slaves (assuming those slaves are not\nconsidered to be part of the group). Corporations, families, communities, and\nterrorist groups all have their own group interests. Each of these group\ninterests corresponds to one or more norms, which is what each member of that\nsociety is supposed to do. For example, it is in the group interest that\neveryone respect everyone else's property rights. Therefore, the group norm is\nnot to steal (at least, not from other members of the\ngroup[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos896514)).\n\nEvery person in a society potentially has one or more competing interests that\nconflict with the group interest, and competing norms that conflict with the\ngroup norm. Someone in that we-don't-steal society might really want to steal.\nHe might be starving, and need to steal food to survive. He just might want\nother people's stuff. These are examples of self-interest. He might have some\ncompeting relational interest. He might be a member of a criminal gang, and\nneed to steal to prove his loyalty to the group; here, the competing interest\nmight be the group interest of another group. Or he might want to steal for\nsome higher moral reason: a competing moral interest—the Robin Hood archetype,\nfor example.\n\nA societal dilemma is the choice every actor has to make between group\ninterest and his or her competing interests. It's the choice we make when we\ndecide whether or not to follow the group norm. Those who do cooperate, and\nthose who do not defect. Those are both loaded terms, but I mean them to refer\nonly to the action as a result of the dilemma.\n\nDefectors—the liars and outliers of the book's title—are the people within a\ngroup who don't go along with the norms of that group. The term isn't defined\naccording to any absolute morals, but instead in opposition to whatever the\ngroup interest and the group norm is. Defectors steal in a society that has\ndeclared that stealing is wrong, but they also help slaves escape in a society\nwhere tolerating slavery is the norm. Defectors change as society changes;\ndefection is in the eye of the beholder. Or, more specifically, it is in the\neyes of everyone else. Someone who was a defector under the former East German\ngovernment was no longer in that group after the fall of the Berlin Wall. But\nthose who followed the societal norms of East Germany, like the Stasi,\nwere—all of a sudden—viewed as defectors within the new united Germany.\n\nFigure 1: The Terms Used in the Book, and Their Relationships\n\n![1.1](images/00004.jpg)\n\nCriminals are defectors, obviously, but that answer is too facile. Everyone\ndefects at least some of the time. It's both dynamic and situational. People\ncan cooperate about some things and defect about others. People can cooperate\nwith one group they're in and defect from another. People can cooperate today\nand defect tomorrow, or cooperate when they're thinking clearly and defect\nwhen they're reacting in a panic. People can cooperate when their needs are\ncared for, and defect when they're starving.\n\nWhen four black North Carolina college students staged a sit-in at a whites-\nonly lunch counter inside a Woolworth's five-and-dime store in Greensboro, in\n1960, they were criminals. So are women who drive cars in Saudi Arabia. Or\nhomosexuals in Iran. Or the 2011 protesters in Egypt, who sought to end their\ncountry's political regime. Conversely, child brides in Pakistan are not\ncriminalized and neither are their parents, even though in some cases they\nmarry off five-year-old girls. The Nicaraguan rebels who fought the\nSandinistas were criminals, terrorists, insurgents, or freedom fighters,\ndepending on which side you supported and how you viewed the conflict. Pot\nsmokers and dealers in the U.S. are officially criminals, but in the\nNetherlands those offenses are ignored by the police. Those who share\ncopyrighted movies and music are breaking the law, even if they have moral\njustifications for their actions.\n\nDefecting doesn't necessarily mean breaking government-imposed laws. An\northodox Jew who eats a ham and cheese sandwich is violating the rules of his\nreligion. A Mafioso who snitches on his colleagues is violating omertà, the\ncode of silence. A relief worker who indulges in a long, hot shower after a\ntiring journey, and thereby depletes an entire village's hot water supply,\nunwittingly puts his own self-interest ahead of the interest of the people he\nintends to help.\n\nWhat we're concerned with is the overall scope of defection. I mean this term\nto be general, comprising the number of defectors, the rate of their\ndefection, the frequency of their defection, and the intensity (the amount of\ndamage) of their defection. Just as we're interested in the general level of\ntrust within the group, we're interested in the general scope of defection\nwithin the group.\n\nSocietal pressures are how society ensures that people follow the group norms,\nas opposed to some competing norms. The term is meant to encompass everything\nsociety does to protect itself: both from fellow members of society, and non-\nsocietal members who live within and amongst the society. More generally, it's\nhow society enforces intra-group trust.\n\nThe terms attacker and defender are pretty obvious. The predator is the\nattacker, the prey is the defender. It's all intertwined, and sometimes these\nterms can get a bit muddy. Watch a martial arts match, and you'll see each\nperson defending against his opponent's attacks while at the same time hoping\nhis own attacks get around his opponent's defenses. In war, both sides attack\nand defend at the tactical level, even though one side might be attacking and\nthe other defending at the political level. These terms are value-neutral.\nAttackers can be criminals trying to break into a home, superheroes raiding a\ncriminal mastermind's stronghold, or cancer cells metastasizing their way\nthrough a hapless human host. Defenders can be a family protecting its home\nfrom invasion, the criminal mastermind protecting his lair from the\nsuperheroes, or a posse of leukocytes engulfing opportunistic pathogens they\nencounter.\n\nThese definitions are important to remember as you read this book. It's easy\nfor us to bring our own emotional baggage into discussions about security, but\nmost of the time we're just trying to understand the underlying mechanisms at\nplay, and those mechanisms are the same, regardless of the underlying moral\ncontext.\n\nSometimes we need the dispassionate lens of history to judge famous defectors\nlike Oliver North, Oskar Schindler, and Vladimir Lenin.\n\n\nPart I\n\nThe Science of Trust\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Natural History of Security\n\nOur exploration of trust is going to start and end with security, because\nsecurity is what you need when you don't have any trust and—as we'll\nsee—security is ultimately how we induce trust in society. It's what brings\nrisk down to tolerable levels, allowing trust to fill in the remaining gaps.\n\nYou can learn a lot about security from watching the natural world.\n\n  * Lions seeking to protect their turf will raise their voices in a “[territorial chorus](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1075943),” their cooperation reducing the risk of encroachment by other predators for the local food supply.\n\n  * When [hornworms](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1076289) start eating a particular species of sagebrush, the plant responds by emitting a molecule that warns any wild tobacco plants growing nearby that hornworms are around. In response, the tobacco plants deploy chemical defenses that repel the hornworms, to the benefit of both plants.\n\n  * Some types of [plasmids secrete](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1076798) a toxin that kills the bacteria that carry them. Luckily for the bacteria, the plasmids also emit an antidote; and as long as a plasmid secretes both, the host bacterium survives. But if the plasmid dies, the antidote decays faster than the toxin, and the bacterium dies. This acts as an insurance policy for the plasmids, ensuring that bacteria don't evolve ways to kill them.\n\nIn the beginning of life on this planet, some 3.8 billion years ago, an\norganism's only job was to reproduce. That meant growing, and growing required\nenergy. [Heat and\nlight](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1077148) were\nthe obvious sources—photosynthesis appeared 3 billion years ago;\nchemosynthesis is at least a half a billion years older than that—but\nconsuming the other living things floating around in the primordial ocean\nworked just as well. So life discovered predation.\n\nWe don't know what that [first animal\npredator](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1077693)\nwas, but it was likely a simple marine organism somewhere between 500 million\nand 550 million years ago. Initially, the only defense a species had against\nbeing eaten was to have so many individuals floating around the primordial\nseas that enough individuals were left to reproduce, so that the constant\nattrition didn't matter. But then life realized it might be able to avoid\nbeing eaten. So it evolved defenses. And predators evolved better ways to\ncatch and eat.\n\nThus security was born, the planet's fourth oldest activity after eating,\neliminating, and reproducing.\n\nOkay, that's a pretty gross simplification, and it would get me booted out of\nany evolutionary biology class. When talking about evolution and natural\nselection, it's easy to say that organisms make explicit decisions about their\ngenetic future. They don't. There's nothing purposeful or teleological about\nthe evolutionary process, and I shouldn't anthropomorphize it. Species don't\nrealize anything. They don't discover anything, either. They don't decide to\nevolve, or try genetic options. It's tempting to talk about evolution as if\nthere's some outside intelligence directing it. We say “prehistoric lungfish\nfirst learned how to breathe air,” or “monarch butterflies learned to store\nplant toxins in their bodies to make themselves taste bad to predators,” but\nit doesn't work that way. Random mutation provides the material upon which\nnatural selection acts. It is through this process that individuals of a\nspecies change subtly from their parents, effectively “trying out” new\nfeatures. Those innovations that turn out to be beneficial—air breathing—give\nthe individuals a competitive advantage and might potentially propagate\nthrough the species (there's still a lot of randomness in this process). Those\nthat turn out to be detrimental—the overwhelming majority of them—kill or\notherwise disadvantage the individual and die out.\n\nBy “beneficial,” I mean something very specific: increasing an organism's\nability to survive long enough to successfully pass its genes on to future\ngenerations. Or, to use Richard Dawkins's perspective from [The Selfish\nGene](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1078032), genes\nthat helped their host individuals—or other individuals with that\ngene—successfully reproduce tended to persist in higher numbers in\npopulations.\n\nIf we were designing a life form, as we might do in a computer game, we would\ntry to figure out what sort of security it needed and give it abilities\naccordingly. Real-world species don't have that luxury. Instead, they try new\nattributes randomly. So instead of an external designer optimizing a species'\nabilities based on its needs, evolution randomly walks through the solution\nspace and stops at the first solution that works—even if just barely. Then it\nclimbs upwards in the fitness landscape until it reaches a local optimum. You\nget a lot of weird security that way.\n\nYou get teeth, claws, group dispersing behavior, feigning injury and playing\ndead, hunting in packs, defending in groups (flocking and schooling and living\nin herds), setting sentinels, digging burrows, flying, mimicry by both\npredators and prey, alarm calls, shells, intelligence, noxious odors, tool\nusing (both offensive and\ndefensive),[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos890427)\nplanning (again, both offensive and defensive), and a whole lot\nmore.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos897915) And\nthis is just in largish animals; we haven't even listed the security solutions\ninsects have come up with. Or plants. Or microbes.\n\nIt has been convincingly argued that one of the reasons sexual reproduction\nevolved about 1.2 billion years ago was to [defend\nagainst](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1078324)\nbiological parasites. The argument is subtle. Basically, parasites reproduce\nso quickly that they overwhelm any individual host defense. The value of DNA\nrecombination, which is what you get in sexual reproduction, is that it\ncontinuously rearranges a species' defenses so parasites can't get the upper\nhand. For this reason, a member of a species that reproduces sexually is much\nmore likely to survive than a species that clones itself asexually—even though\nsuch a species will pass twice as many of its genes to its offspring as a\nsexually reproducing species would.\n\nLife evolved two other methods of defending itself against parasites. One is\nto grow and divide quickly, something that both bacteria and just-fertilized\nmammalian embryos do. The other is to have an immune system. Evolutionarily,\nthis is a relatively new development; it first appeared in [jawed\nfish](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1079050) about\n300 million years\nago.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos898500)\n\nA surprising number of evolutionary adaptations are related to security. Take\nvision, for example. Most animals are more adept at spotting movement than\npicking out details of stationary objects; it's called the [orienting\nresponse](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1079395).[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos898959)\nThat's because things that move may be predators that attack, or prey that\nneeds to be attacked. The human visual system is [particularly\ngood](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1079940) at\nspotting\nanimals.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos899302)\nThe human ability, unique on the planet, to [throw\nthings](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1080549) long\ndistances is another security adaptation. Related is what's called the [size-\nweight\nmisperception](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1081016):\nthe illusion that easier-to-throw rocks are perceived to be lighter than they\nare. It's related to our ability to choose good projectiles. [Similar\nstories](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1081469)\ncould be told about many human\nattributes.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos899671)\n\nThe predator/prey relationship isn't the only pressure that drives evolution.\nAs soon as there was competition for resources, organisms had to develop\nsecurity to defend their own resources and attack the resources of others.\nWhether it's plants competing with each other for access to the sun, predators\nfighting over hunting territory, or animals competing for potential mates,\norganisms had to develop security against others of the same species. And\nagain, evolution resulted in all sorts of [weird\nsecurity](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1081800).\nAnd it works amazingly well.\n\nSecurity on Earth went on more or less like this for 500 million years. It's a\ncontinual arms race. A rabbit that can run away at 30 miles per hour—in short\nbursts, of course—is at an evolutionary advantage when the weasels and stoats\ncan only run 28 mph, but at an evolutionary disadvantage once predators can\nrun 32 mph.\n\nFigure 2: The Red Queen Effect in Action\n\n![2](images/00005.jpg)\n\nIt's different when the evolutionary advantage is against nature. A polar bear\nhas thick fur because it's cold in the Arctic. And it's thick to a point,\nbecause the Arctic doesn't get colder in response to the polar bear's changes.\nBut that same polar bear has fur that appears white so as to better sneak up\non seals. But a better camouflaged polar bear means that only more wary seals\nsurvive and reproduce, which means that the polar bears need to be even better\nat camouflage to eat, which means that the seals need to be more wary, and on\nand on and on up to some physical upper limit on camouflage and wariness.\n\nThis only-relative evolutionary arms race is known as the [Red Queen\nEffect](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1082221),\nafter Lewis Carroll's race in Through the Looking-Glass: “It takes all the\nrunning you can do, to keep in the same place.” Predators develop all sorts of\nnew tricks to catch prey, and prey develop all sorts of new tricks to evade\npredators. The prey get more poisonous, so their predators get more poison-\nresistant, so the prey get even more poisonous. A species has to [continuously\nimprove](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1082790) just\nto survive, and any species that can't keep up—or bumps up against\nphysiological or environmental constraints—becomes extinct.\n\n[Figure 3:](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_026.html#filepos816702)\nThe Red Queen Effect Feedback Loop\n\n![3](images/00006.jpg)\n\nAlong with becoming faster, more poisonous, and bitier, some organisms became\nsmarter. At first, a little smarts went a long way. Intelligence allows\nindividuals to adapt their behaviors, moment by moment, to suit their\nenvironment and circumstances. It allows them to remember the past and learn\nfrom experience. It lets them be individually adaptive. No one has a date, but\nvertebrates first appeared about 525 million years ago—and continued to\nimprove on various branches of the tree of life: mammals (215 million years\nago), birds (75 million years ago), primates (60 million years ago), the genus\nHomo (2.5 million years ago), and then humans (somewhere between 200,000 and\n450,000 years ago, depending on whose evidence you believe). When it comes to\nsecurity, as with so many things, humans changed everything.\n\nLet's pause for a second. This isn't a book about animal intelligence, and I\ndon't want to start an argument about which animals can be considered\nintelligent, or what about human intelligence is unique, or even how to define\nthe word “intelligence.” It's definitely a fascinating subject, and we can\nlearn a lot about our own intelligence by studying the intelligence of [other\nanimals](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1083573).\nEven my neat intelligence progression from the previous paragraph might be\nwrong: flatworms can be trained, and some cephalopods are surprisingly smart.\nBut those topics aren't really central to this book, so I'm going to elide\nthem. For my purposes, it's enough to say that there is a uniquely human\nintelligence.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos900502)\n\nAnd humans take their intelligence seriously. The brain only represents 3% of\ntotal body mass, but uses 20% of the body's total blood supply and 25% of its\noxygen. And—unlike other primates, even—we'll [supply our\nbrains](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1084198) with\nblood and oxygen at the expense of other body parts.\n\nOne of the things intelligence makes possible is [cultural\nevolution](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1084751).\nInstead of needing to wait for genetic changes, humans are able to improve\ntheir survivability through the direct transmission of skills and ideas. These\nmemes can be taught from generation to generation, with the more survivable\nideas propagating and the bad ones dying out. Humans are not the only species\nthat teaches its young, but humans have taken this to a new\nlevel.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos901035) This\ncaused a flowering of security ideas: deception and concealment; weapons,\narmor, and shields; coordinated attack and defense tactics; locks and their\ncontinuous improvement over the centuries; gunpowder, explosives, guns, cruise\nmissiles, and everything else that goes “bang” or “boom”; paid security guards\nand soldiers and policemen; professional criminals; forensic databases of\nfingerprints, tire tracks, shoe prints, and DNA samples; and so on.\n\nIt's not just intelligence that makes humans different. One of the things\nthat's unique about humans is the extent of our socialization. Yes, there are\nother social species: other primates, most mammals and some\nbirds.[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos901656) But\nhumans have taken sociality to a completely different level. And with that\nsocialization came all sorts of new security considerations: concern for an\never-widening group of individuals, concern about potential deception and the\nneed to detect it, concern about one's own and others' reputations, concern\nabout rival groups of attackers and the corresponding need to develop groups\nof defenders, recognition of the need to take preemptive security measures\nagainst potential attacks, and after-the-fact responses to already-occurred\nattacks for the purpose of deterring others in the\nfuture.[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos901965)\n\nSome scientists believe that this increased socialization actually spurred the\ndevelopment of human\nintelligence.[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos902517)\nMachiavellian Intelligence Theory—you might also see this called the Social\nBrain Hypothesis—holds that we evolved intelligence primarily in order to\ndetect deception by other humans. Although the “Machiavellian” term came\nlater, the idea first came from psychologist [Nicholas\nHumphrey](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1085109).\nHumphrey observed that wild gorillas led a pretty simple existence, with\nabundant and easily harvested food, few predators, and not much else to do but\neat, sleep, and play. This was in contrast to gorillas in the laboratory,\nwhich demonstrated impressive powers of creative reasoning. So the obvious\nquestion is: what's the evolutionary advantage of being intelligent and clever\nif it's not required in order to survive in the wild? Humphrey proposed that\nthe primary role of primate intelligence and creativity was to deal with the\ncomplexities of living with other primates. In other words, we evolved smarts\nnot to outsmart the world, but to outsmart each other.\n\nIt's more than that. As we became more social, we needed to learn how to get\nalong with each other: both cooperating with each other and ensuring everyone\nelse cooperates, too. It involves understanding each other. Psychologist\n[Daniel\nGilbert](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1085543)\ndescribes it very well:\n\n> We are social mammals whose brains are highly specialized for thinking about\n> others. Understanding what others are up to—what they know and want, what\n> they are doing and planning—has been so crucial to the survival of our\n> species that our brains have developed an obsession with all things human.\n> We think about people and their intentions; talk about them; look for and\n> remember them.\n\nThis makes evolutionary sense. Intelligence is a valuable survival trait when\nyou have to deal with the threats from the natural world. But intelligence is\nan even more valuable survival trait when you have to deal with the threats\nfrom other intelligent individuals. An intelligent adversary is a different\nanimal, so to speak, than an unintelligent adversary. An intelligent attacker\nis adaptive. An intelligent attacker can learn about its prey. An intelligent\nattacker can make long-term plans. An intelligent adversary can predict your\ndefenses and incorporate them into his plans. If you're being attacked by an\nintelligent human, your most useful defense is to also be an intelligent\nhuman. Our ancestors grew smarter because those around them grew smarter, and\nthe only way to keep up was to become even\nsmarter.[12](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos902877)\nIt's a Red Queen Effect in action.\n\nIn primates, the frequency of deception is directly proportional to the size\nof a species' neocortex: the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain. That is,\nthe bigger the brain, the greater the [capacity for\ndeception](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1085871).\nThe human brain has a neocortex that's four times the size of its nearest\nevolutionary relative. Eighty percent of our brain is neocortex, compared to\n50% in our nearest existing relative and 10% to 40% in [non-primate\nmammals](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1086289).[13](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos903300)\n\nAnd as our neocortex grew, the complexity of our social interactions grew as\nwell. Primatologist Robin Dunbar has studied primate group sizes. Dunbar\nexamined 38 different primate genera, and found that the volume of the\n[neocortex\ncorrelates](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1086711)\nwith the size of the troop. He established that the [mean human\ngroup](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1087089) size\nis 150.[14](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos903603)\nThis is the Dunbar number: the number of people with whom we can have explicit\nand personal encounters, whose history we can remember, and with whom we can\nexperience some level of\nintimacy.[15](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos904159)\nOf course, it's an average. You personally might be able to keep track of more\nor fewer. This [number appears\nregularly](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1087812) in\nhuman society: it's the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village; the\nsize at which Hittite settlements split; and it's a basic unit in professional\narmies, from Roman times to the present day. It's the average size of people's\nChristmas card lists. It's a common department size in modern corporations.\n\nSo as our ancestors got smarter, their social groups got larger. Chimpanzees\nlive in groups of approximately 60 individuals. Australopithecus—our ancestor\nfrom 4.5 million years ago—had an average group size of 70 individuals. When\nour first tool-using ancestors appeared 2 million years ago, the group size\ngrew to 80. Homo erectus had a [mean group\nsize](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1088166) of 110,\nand Neanderthals 140. Homo sapiens: 150.\n\nOne hundred and fifty people is a lot to keep track of, especially if they're\nall clever, sneaky, duplicitous, and—as it turns out—murderous. There is a lot\nof evidence—both from the anthropological record and from ethnographic studies\nof contemporary primitive cultures—that humans are innately quite violent, and\nthat intertribal warfare was endemic in primitive society. Several studies\nestimate that 15–25% of prehistoric males [died in\nwarfare](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1088559).[16](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos904888)\n\nEconomist [Paul\nSeabright](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1089077)\npostulates that intelligence and murderousness are mutually reinforcing. The\nmore murderous a species is, the greater the selective benefit of\nintelligence; smarter people are more likely to survive their human\nadversaries. And the smarter someone is, the more an adversary wants to kill\nhim—and not just make him submit, as [other\nspecies](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1089413) do.\n\nLooking at the average weight of humans and extrapolating from other animals,\nhumans [should primarily\nhunt](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1089754) medium-\nsized rodents; indeed, early humans primarily hunted small game. And hunting\nsmall game is much more efficient for a bunch of\nreasons.[17](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos905671)\nEven so, [all primitive\nsocieties](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1090506)\nhunt large game: antelopes, walrus, and so on. The theory is that although\nlarge-game hunting is less efficient, the skill set is the same as what's\nrequired for intertribal warfare. The groups that excelled at large-game\nhunting were more likely to survive the endemic warfare that existed in our\nevolutionary past. Group hunting also reinforced social bonds, which are a\nuseful group survival trait.\n\nA male killing another male of the same species—especially an unrelated\nmale—eliminates a sexual rival. If you have fewer sexual rivals, you have more\nof your own offspring. Natural selection favors murderousness. On the other\nhand, attempting to murder another individual of the same species is\ndangerous; you might get yourself killed in the process. This means fewer\noffspring, which implies a counterbalancing natural selection against\nmurderousness.\n\nIt's another Red Queen Effect, this one involving murder. Evolutionary\npsychologist [David\nBuss](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1090850) writes:\n\n> As the motivations to murder evolved in our minds, a set of counter-\n> inclinations also developed. Killing is a risky business. It can be\n> dangerous and inflict horrible costs on the victim.

In the evolutionary arms race, homicide victims have\n> played a critical and unappreciated role—they pave the way for the evolution\n> of anti-homicide defenses.\n\nThere is considerable debate about how violent we really are, with the\nmajority opinion coming down on the “[quite\nviolent](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1091162)”\nside, especially among males from ages 16 to 24. On the other hand, [some\nargue](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1091703) that\nhuman violence has declined over the millennia, primarily due to the changing\ncircumstances that come with civilization. We do know it's been traditionally\nvery hard to convince soldiers to [kill in\nwar](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1092012), and our\nexperience with post-traumatic stress disorder shows that it has long-lasting\nill effects. Our violence may be innate, but it depends a lot on context.\nWe're comparable [with other\nprimates](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1092353).[18](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos906277)\n\nBut if we are so naturally murderous, how did our prehistoric ancestors come\nto trust each other? We know they did, because if they hadn't, society would\nnever have developed. People would never have gathered into groups that\nextended past immediate family, let alone into villages and towns and cities.\nDivision of labor would have never evolved, because people couldn't trust\nothers to do their parts. We would never have established trade with the\nstrangers we occasionally encountered, let alone with companies based halfway\nacross the planet. Friendships wouldn't exist. Societies based on either\ngeography or interest would be impossible. Any sort of governmental structure:\nforget it. It doesn't matter how big your neocortex is or how abstractly you\ncan reason: unless you can trust others, your species will forever remain\nstuck in the Stone Age.\n\nThe answer to that question will make use of the concepts presented in this\nchapter—the Red Queen Effect, the Dunbar number, our natural intelligence and\nmurderousness—and it will make use of security. It turns out that trust in\nsociety isn't easy, and that we're still getting it wrong.\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Evolution of Cooperation\n\nTwo of the most successful species on the planet are humans and leafcutter\nants of Brazil. Evolutionary biologist Edward O. Wilson has spent much of his\ncareer studying the ants, and argues that their success is due to [division of\nlabor](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1093638).[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos906876)\nThere are four different kinds of leafcutter workers: gardeners, defenders,\nforagers, and soldiers. Each type of ant is specialized to its task, and\ntogether the colony does much better than colonies of non-specialized ant\nspecies.\n\nHumans specialize too, and—even better—we can adapt our specialization to the\nsituation. A leafcutter ant is born to a particular role; we get to decide our\nspecialization in both the long and short term, and change it if it's not\nworking out for\nus.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos907376)\n\nDivision of labor is an exercise in trust. A gardener leafcutter ant has to\ntrust that the forager leafcutter ants will bring leaf fragments back to the\nnest. I, specializing right now in book writing, have to trust that my\npublisher is going to print this book and bookstores are going to sell it. And\nthat someone is going to grow food that I can buy with my royalty check. If I\ncouldn't trust literally millions of nameless, faceless other people, I\ncouldn't specialize.\n\nBrazilian leafcutter ant colonies evolved trust and cooperation because\nthey're all siblings. We had to evolve it the hard way.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nWe all employ both cooperating and defecting strategies. Most of the time our\nself-interest and group interest coincide, and we act in accordance with the\ngroup norm. Only sometimes do we act in some competing norm. It depends on\ncircumstance, and it depends on who we are. Some of us are more cooperative,\nmore honest, more altruistic, and fairer. And some of us are less so. There\nisn't one dominant survival strategy that evolution has handed down to us; we\nhave the flexibility to switch between different strategies.\n\nOne way to think of the relationship between society as a whole and its\ndefectors is as a parasitic relationship. Take the human body as an example.\nOnly 10% of the total number of cells in our human bodies are us—human cells\nwith our particular genome. The other 90% are symbionts, genetically unrelated\norganisms.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos907897)\nOur relationship with them ranges from mutualism (we both benefit) to\ncommensalism (one benefits) to parasitism (one benefits and the other is\nharmed). The society of our bodies needs the cooperators to survive, and at\nthe same time spends a lot of energy defending itself against the defectors.\n\nExtending the analogy even further, our social systems are filled with\nparasites as well. Parasites steal stuff instead of buying it. They take more\nthan their share in a communal situation. They overstay their welcome on their\nAunt Faye's couch. They incur unsustainable debt, confident that bankruptcy\nlaws—or some expensive lawyers—will enable them to bail out on their creditors\nwhen the going gets tough.\n\nParasites are all over the Internet. Crime is a huge business. Spammers are\nparasitic on e-mail. Griefers in online games are parasitic on more\nconventional players. File sharers copy music instead of paying for it;\nthey're parasitic on the music industry, getting the benefit of commercial\nmusic without giving back any money in return.\n\nExcepting the smallest and simplest cases, every society has parasites living\ninside it. And there is an evolutionary advantage to being a parasite as long\nas there aren't too many of them and they aren't too good at it.\n\nBeing a parasite is a balancing act. Biological parasites do best if they\ndon't immediately kill their hosts, but instead let them survive long enough\nfor the parasites to spread to additional hosts. Ebola is too successful, so\nit fails as a species. The common cold does a much better job of spreading\nitself; it infects, and in the end kills, far more people by being much less\n“effective.” Predators do best if they don't kill enough prey to wipe out the\nentire species. Spammers do better if they don't clog e-mail to the point\nwhere no one uses it anymore, and rogue banks are more profitable if they\ndon't crash the entire economy. All parasites do better if they don't destroy\nwhatever system they've latched themselves onto. Parasites thrive only if they\ndon't thrive too well.\n\nThere's a clever model from game theory that illustrates this: the [Hawk-Dove\ngame](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1094301). It was\ninvented by geneticists John Maynard Smith and George R. Price in 1971 to\nexplain conflicts between animals of the same species. Like most game theory\nmodels, it's pretty simplistic. But what it illuminates about the real world\nis profound.\n\nThe game works like this. Assume a population of individuals with differing\nsurvival strategies. Some cooperate and some defect. In the language of the\ngame, the defectors are hawks. They're aggressive; they attack other\nindividuals, and fight back if attacked. The cooperators are doves. They're\npacific; they share with other doves, and retreat when attacked. You can think\nabout this in terms of animals competing for food. When two doves meet, they\ncooperate and share food. When a hawk meets a dove, the hawk takes food from\nthe dove. When two hawks meet, they fight and one of them randomly gets the\nfood and the other has some probability of dying from\ninjury.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos908738)\n\nSet some initial parameters in the simulation: the value of sharing, the\nchance and severity of harm if two hawks fight each other, and so on. Program\nthis model into a computer, set proportions for the initial population—50%\nhawks and 50% doves, for example—and let individuals interact with each other\nover multiple iterations.\n\nWhat's interesting about this simulation is that neither strategy is\nguaranteed to dominate. Both hawks and doves can be successful, depending on\nthe initial parameters. If the value of the food stolen is greater than the\nrisk of death, the whole population becomes hawks. That is, if everyone is\nstarving, people take what they can from each other without worrying about the\nconsequences. Add a single dove, and it immediately starves. But as food gets\nless valuable (e.g., more plentiful) or fighting gets more dangerous, the\npopulation stabilizes into a mixture of hawks and doves. The more dangerous\nfighting is, the fewer hawks there will be. If food is reasonably plentiful\nand fighting reasonably dangerous, the population stabilizes into a mixture of\nmostly doves and fewer hawks. But unless you plug some really unrealistic\nnumbers into the simulation—like starting out with a population entirely of\ndoves—there will always be at least a few hawks in the mix.\n\nThis makes sense. Imagine a society made up entirely of cooperative doves.\nThey share food whenever they meet each other, never stealing from one\nanother. Now add a single hawk to the society. He does great. He steals food\nfrom all the doves, and since no one ever fights back, he has no risk of\ndying. It's the best survival strategy ever.\n\nNow add a second hawk. The strategy is still pretty effective; if the\npopulation is large enough, the two hawks will never even meet. But as the\nnumber of hawks grows, the chance of two of them encountering each other—and\none of them dying in the resultant fight—increases. At some point, and the\nexact point depends on the parameters, there are enough other hawks around\nthat being a hawk is as dangerous as being a dove has become. That's the\nstable percentage of hawks in the population.\n\nAside from making fighting more deadly or food less valuable, there are other\nways to affect the percentages of hawks and doves. If doves can recognize\nhawks and refuse to engage, the population will have fewer hawks. If doves can\nsurvive hawk attacks without losing their food—by developing defenses, by\nlearning to be sneaky—the population will have fewer hawks. If there is a way\nfor doves to punish hawks, the population will have fewer hawks. If there is a\nway for doves to do even better if they work together, the population will\nhave fewer hawks. If hawks can gang up on doves profitably, the population\nwill have more hawks. In general, we get fewer hawks if we increase the\nbenefits of being a dove and/or raise the costs of being a hawk, and we get\nmore hawks if we do the reverse. All of this makes intuitive sense, and\nshouldn't come as a surprise.\n\nAnd while a population consisting entirely of doves is stable, you can only\nget there if you start the game out that way. And if you assume that\nindividuals in the game can think strategically and change their strategies as\npeople can—doves can become hawks, and hawks can become doves—then an all-dove\npopulation is no longer stable. A physicist would describe an all-dove\npopulation as an unstable equilibrium. Given how easily a dove can become a\nhawk, it's very unstable. There will always be at least a minority of hawks.\n\nThe Hawk-Dove game is a model, and not intended to explain how cooperation\nevolved. However, several lessons can be learned by extrapolating the Hawk-\nDove game into the real world. Any society will have a mix of people who\ncooperate and share, and people who defect and steal. But as the penalty, or\ncost, for attempting to steal, and failing, increases—it could be dying, it\ncould be being jailed, it could be something else—there will be fewer\ndefectors. Similarly, as the benefit of stealing increases—either in the value\nof what the thief gets, or in the probability he'll succeed in stealing—there\nwill be more thieves.\n\nIn the real world, there are gradations of hawkishness. One person might\nmurder someone to take his money; another might rob a person but let him live.\nA third might just shortchange him in some business transaction, or take an\nunfair share at the family dinner. Those are all hawkish behaviors, but\nthey're not the same. Also, no one is 100% hawk or 100% dove; they're\nindividual mixtures, depending on\ncircumstance.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos909512)\n\nIf the benefit of being a hawk is greater than the risk of being a hawk, then\nhawks become the dominant strategy. Doves can't survive, and everyone becomes\na hawk. That's anarchy: Hobbes's “[war of all against\nall](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1094645).” In\nhuman terms, society falls apart. If we want to maintain a society based on\ncooperation, we need to ensure that the rate of defection stays small enough\nto allow society to remain cohesive.\n\nFigure 4: Metaphorical Knobs to Control a Hawk-Dove Game\n\n![4](images/00007.jpg)\n\nYou can think of these parameters as knobs that control the rate of defection.\nWe might not think of it in those terms, but it's what we do all the time in\nthe real world. Want fewer burglars? Increase the prison term for burglary,\nput more policemen on the street, or subsidize burglar alarms. Willing to live\nwith more burglars? Understaff police departments, make it easier for burglars\nto fence stolen merchandise, or convince people to keep more cash at\nhome.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos911355) These\nare all societal pressures. So are increasing or decreasing social inequality,\nand teaching respect for other people's property in school.\n\nIn our world, the costs and benefits of being a defector vary over time. As we\ndevelop new security technologies, and as the defectors develop new ways\naround them, society stabilizes with a different scope of defection.\nSimilarly, as we develop new systems—Internet banking, for example—and\ndefectors develop new ways to attack them, society stabilizes with a still\ndifferent scope of defection. If the police force gets better at arresting\nspeeders, there will be fewer of them. If someone invents a radar detector or\nif cars handle better at higher speeds, there will be more\nspeeders.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos911759)\n\nWe'll talk about this more in later chapters. The important point for right\nnow is that no matter how hard we make life for the hawks among us—shunning\nthem, removing them from society completely, making it less likely they will\nprofit from their aggressive tactics—we will never be able to get the hawk\npercentage down to zero. Yes, we can make it very unprofitable to be a hawk,\nbut if the percentage drops too low, being a hawk will become a more\nadvantageous strategy. And because we humans are intelligent and adaptable,\nsomeone will figure that out and switch strategies.\n\nDefectors are endemic to all complex systems. This is one of the dominant\nparadigms of life. We need to recognize that all of our complex human systems,\nwhether they are millennia-old social systems or modern socio-technical\nsystems, will always have parasites. There will always be a group of people\nwho will try to take without giving back. The best we can hope for is to do\nwhat our bodies do, and what every natural ecosystem does: keep those\nparasites down to a tolerable level.\n\nIt's not even clear that natural selection favors the society with a minimum\nof hawk-like behavior. Hawks have value to society. In fact, if societies are\nin conflict with each other, it is evolutionarily advantageous to have some\naggressive individuals. When war breaks out, the society with more hawks is\nlikely to prevail. Again, think back to the primitive world in which we\nevolved. If you assume, as many anthropologists do, that tribal warfare was\nendemic among human societies, then having a substantial percentage of hawks\naround was valuable. Yes, they took advantage of the doves in peacetime, but\nthey ensured the survival of those doves in wartime. Of course, we're now\nstuck with too many hawks because of the evolutionary pressures of 100,000\nyears ago.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nI'm about to lump a lot of human traits together: cooperation, altruism,\nkindness, trustworthiness, and fairness. They're different, but all prosocial\nbehaviors—behaviors intended to help others—and they're the glue that holds\nhuman society together. While psychologists put fine distinctions on them,\nconsidering them as facets of a whole is more useful for our purposes. They\nare all precursors of trust, and what allowed us to take the concept of\nspecialization to a level unprecedented on our planet.\n\nFiguring out how these traits evolved is an open question. Sure, they're great\nfor our species as a whole, but that doesn't affect evolution. What matters\nfor evolution is whether a particular characteristic helps the reproductive\nsuccess of individuals with that characteristic. Kindness might be useful for\nsociety, but if it didn't result in kind people reproducing more successfully\nthan unkind people, it would be bred out of the species pretty quickly.\n\nThere is an obvious evolutionary advantage in trusting kin: people with whom\nyou share genetic material. If you have a gene, then your close relatives are\nlikely to have that same gene. A gene that, on balance, makes it more likely\nfor you to help your close relatives pass their genes on to future generations\nwill also be more likely to be passed on to future generations—assuming, of\ncourse, that the help it provides outweighs the cost to provide it. For\nexample, if a lioness is genetically predisposed to suckle her sister's\noffspring, there's a good chance that her nieces and nephews share the genes\nresponsible for that behavior, and will pass them on to their own offspring.\n\nThe natural world is filled with examples of animals trusting, helping, and\nbehaving altruistically with each other. Not just ants: many insects defend\ntheir nests or hives with their lives. Some animals who live in groups and\nfear predation—prairie dogs, ground squirrels, some monkeys, assorted herd\nanimals, and many birds—alert the group with an alarm call if they spot a\npredator. Other animals hunt in groups. Most of these examples turn out to be\nkin helping\nkin.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos912174)\n\nExtending this tendency towards non-kin is much more\ndifficult.[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos912827)\nArchaeo-logists have a four-stage model of the human process. Stage one\nhappened 6 million years ago, when empathy and a motivation to help others\ndeveloped in a common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. Stage two began 1.8\nmillion years ago; compassion can be seen in both short-term caring for sick\nindividuals and special treatment for the dead. Stage three is much more\nrecent; around 500,000 or 400,000 years ago, humans became dependent on group\nhunting, and started exhibiting long-term care for the injured and the infirm.\nStage four occurred in modern humans starting 120,000 years ago, when\n[compassion\nextended](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1094990) to\nstrangers, animals, and sometimes even objects: religious objects, antiques,\nfamily heirlooms, etc. It probably didn't extend much past groups bigger than\nthe Dunbar number of 150 until the [invention of\nagriculture](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1095621),\nabout 10,000 years ago—I guess that's a fifth stage.\n\nStill, that doesn't tell us how or why it eventually did.\n\nThere are two basic types of non-kin cooperation. The first is\nmutualism.[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos913280)\nIn some species, unrelated individuals cooperate because together they can\nperform tasks they couldn't do by themselves. A pack might hunt together\nbecause it can kill larger prey than the members could individually.\n[Unrelated\nelephants](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1095984)\nhelp each other move objects they could not move alone.\n\nWithin a species, there's a tendency for individuals to cooperate by limiting\ntheir behavior. In many species, males fight each other for the prize of\nmating with a female. Primates fight to determine who is in charge of the\ntribe. In my house, the two cats fight to determine who gets to sit in the\nsunny chair. All these fights are serious, but tend to be non-injurious and\nare governed by ritual: roaring contests in red deer, claw-waving in male\nfiddler crabs, shell-rapping in hermit crabs. This is because these\n[ritualized\nbattles](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1096494) are\noften more about getting information about the other individual than actually\nfighting, and a non-lethal battle is often a more survivable strategy. The\nHawk-Dove game can model these types of conflicts: if the risk of being a hawk\nis great enough, it makes evolutionary sense to be a dove even if your\nopponent is a hawk, because it's more survivable to retreat than to\nfight.[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos914068)\n\nSo maybe we became smart enough to realize that cooperation usually beat\ndefection as a survival skill, and modified our behavior accordingly. Those\nwho could make that trade-off were more likely to pass their genes on to the\nnext generation. This cooperation extended slowly outwards, from the immediate\nfamily group to more distant relatives to kith to familiar strangers—and over\ntime, to unfamiliar strangers. And that cooperation slowly turned into trust.\n\nIntelligence alone doesn't explain our trust of non-kin, though. Raw\nintelligence makes people calculating, but not necessarily honest or\ncompassionate.[12](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos915199)\nThe missing ingredient is called reciprocal altruism. This is the second basic\ntype of non-kin cooperation, and means that we tend to treat people as we have\nbeen treated.\n\nReciprocal altruism isn't limited to humans. [Vampire\nbats](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1097550) must\ningest blood every 60 hours or they'll die. If a bat can't find its own meal,\na non-kin bat will often regurgitate some of its undigested blood and feed it\nto the hungry bat, knowing that another bat will regurgitate food for it at\nsome later time. Then, the bats pay attention. They have [large\nfrontal](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1097888)\nlobes in their brains that they use to remember which other bats have shared\nblood with them in the past. A bat is more likely to share blood with a bat\nthat has shared blood with it previously. Similarly, animals such as dogs,\ncats, horses, and some birds remember who was nice to them.\n\nThink about our ancestors and their relationship with others living in their\ncommunity. Cheating is valuable to the individual in the short term. But a\nperson living in that community had an additional incentive not to cheat: if\nhe did, he squandered his chance at future cooperation with his victim, and\nrisked his reputation with the community. If the benefits of future\ncooperation are great enough, it makes evolutionary sense for non-kin to [help\neach other](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1098337)\nif they can be reasonably sure they will be repaid at a later date.\n\nA reasonable question, then, is whether altruism in the purest sense of the\nword really exists, or if it's all based on some anticipated reward or\npunishment. Perhaps Mother Teresa wasn't really altruistic; she expected her\nreward in Heaven. Perhaps our instinct to protect our children isn't really\naltruistic; it's because we expect them to care for us in our old age. We\ndon't consider vampire bats altruistic; they expect repayment at some future\ndate. Even the mother who sacrifices her life for her child might just be\nensuring that her genes survive.\n\nIf we simplify, the psychological theory of [transactional\nanalysis](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1098689)\nholds that people expect some sort of return—either emotional or material—from\ntheir apparent altruism and kindness. So we rescue a stranger from a burning\nbuilding because we expect to survive and be praised, and we give money to\ncharity because it makes us feel virtuous. You can argue that whenever we act\nin the group interest, it's because we know we're better off when we do.\n\nThere's even an alternate theory that explains altruistic behavior without any\nneed for pure, selfless altruism. Biologist Amotz Zahavi's handicap principle\nexplains costly “signals” within species. If you're an individual of above-\naverage fitness, it makes evolutionary sense to spend some of that surplus on\ncostly and hard-to-fake signals to advertise that fact to a [potential\nmate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1099043). This\nholds true for a peacock's tail and a stag's antlers, as well as for a human's\napparently [altruistic\nacts](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1100359). So the\nman who rescues a stranger from a burning building is advertising his kindness\nand physical prowess, and the woman who gives money to charity is advertising\nher wealth. We do know that agreeableness is a trait desired by others in a\nmate; [kind\npeople](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1100733) are\nmore likely to reproduce.\n\nThis seems an irrelevant exercise, rather like debating whether or not there\nis such a thing as free\nwill.[13](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos917212)\n[George\nPrice](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1101810), one\nof the inventors of the Hawk-Dove game, was unable to accept altruism's\nselfish basis, and spent much of his later life trying to demonstrate how\nwrong his mathematical model was. He gave his money away to strangers, let the\nhomeless live in his house, and eventually committed suicide from depression.\nI think a more optimistic viewpoint is in order. People behave in ways that\nare altruistic, empathic, kind, trustworthy, fair, and cooperative. We do\nthese things even though we don't have to. Yes, we have evolved into a species\nthat finds these traits desirable. Yes, this is primarily reciprocal. Yes, we\nare also intelligent and calculating, but this is precisely the point. We have\nthe ability to decide whether to be prosocial or not, and most of us, most of\nthe time, decide positively. And we call these behaviors “altruism,”\n“kindness,” and “cooperation.” We trust because others are trustworthy.\n\nHumans seem to have evolved along these lines, overcoming the murderousness\nthat accompanied our increasing intelligence. There is an enormous amount of\nlaboratory research on altruism, fairness, cooperation, and trust.\nExperimenters have subjects play a variety of [bargaining\ngames](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1102156) where\nthey divide a pot of money amongst themselves, with different outcomes\ndepending on whether or not they act in the group interest or in self-\ninterest. These have names like the Ultimatum\ngame[14](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos917534), the\nDictator\ngame[15](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos920853), the\nTrust\ngame[16](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos922226), and\nthe Public Goods\ngame[17](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos924022), all\nwith many different variants designed to tease out a particular aspect of\nhuman prosocial\nbehavior.[18](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos925545)\nThe general results seem to be that:\n\n  * People tend to be fair-minded.[19](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos927850) They routinely reduce their own rewards in order to be fair to other players.\n\n  * People tend to want to punish unfairness, even at their own personal expense.[20](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos929566) We have a sense of justice and responsibility, and we react negatively to those who act contrary to that sense. In many instances people also reduce their own reward in order to punish someone whom they perceive to be as acting unfairly.\n\n  * People tend to follow social or cultural norms with respect to these prosocial behaviors.[21](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos931213) Definitions of fairness are cultural. People are more likely to be altruistic in a game that emphasizes altruism, and selfish in a game that emphasizes selfishness. Levels of trust and trustworthiness vary across cultures.\n\n  * People tend to be more trusting and altruistic with people they think they know and can identify with—even just a little bit—than with anonymous strangers.[22](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos932027)\n\n  * External factors matter a lot. In experiments, people were kinder after they [found a coin](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1102546), traveled up an escalator (as opposed to traveling down), or watched a video of [flying through clouds](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1102953) (as opposed to watching a video of driving on the ground).\n\nOf course—and this is important to remember—these are typical results, and\nthere is a wide variety of behavior among individual\npeople.[23](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos932285)\nThis matches our experience in the world.\n\nNeuroscience may also help explain altruism, most recently using [mirror\nneurons](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1103448).\nThese are neurons in our brain that fire both when we perform an\naction[24](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos932788) and\nwhen we observe someone else performing the same action. First discovered in\n1992, mirror neurons are theorized to be critical in imitation and learning,\nlanguage acquisition, developing a theory of mind, empathy, and a variety of\nother prosocial behaviors.\n\nAdditionally, a large body of neuroscience research supports the notion that\nwe are [altruistic\ninnately](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1104279),\neven if we receive no direct benefit, because at a deep level we want to be.\nStudies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) show that the\namygdala, the primitive part of the brain associated with fear and anger, is\ninvolved in decisions about [fairness and\njustice](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1105653). And\nit's probably not an unrelated side-effect that people who observe others\nacting either fairly or unfairly rate the fair people as significantly more\nagreeable, likeable, [and\nattractive](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1106123)\nthan the unfair people. We treat each other altruistically because it gives us\npleasure to do so.\n\nWe not only innately trust, but we want to be trusted. A lot of this is\nintellectually calculated, but it goes deeper than that. Our need to be\ntrusted is innate. There's even a biological feedback loop. Researchers have\n[found that\noxytocin](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1106585)—a\nhormone released during social bonding—naturally increases in a person who\nperceives that he is trusted by others. Similarly, artificially increasing\n[someone's\noxytocin](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1107142)\nlevel makes her more trusting.\n\nThe philosopher and economist [Adam\nSmith](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1107547)\nexpressed a similar sentiment 300 years ago:\n\n> How selfish so ever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles\n> in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their\n> happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the\n> pleasure of seeing it.\n\nOf course, human trust isn't all-or-nothing. It's contextual, calibrated by\nour ability to calculate costs and benefits. A lot of our willingness to trust\nnon-kin is calibrated by the society we live in. If we live in a polite\nsociety where trust is generally returned, we're at ease trusting first. If we\nlive in a violent society where strangers are hostile and untrustworthy, we\ndon't trust so easily and require further evidence that our trust will be\nreciprocated.\n\nOur trust rules can be sloppy. We're more likely to trust people who are\nsimilar to us: look like us, dress like us, and speak the same language. In\ngeneral, we're more likely to trust in familiar situations. We also\ngeneralize: if we have a good experience with people of a particular\nnationality or a particular profession, we are likely to trust others of the\nsame type. And if we have a bad experience, we're likely to carry that\nmistrust to others of the same\ntype.[25](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos933154)\nThese rules of thumb might not make logical sense in today's diverse world,\nbut they seem to have been good ideas in our evolutionary past.\n\nThis is all good, but we have a chicken-and-egg problem. Until people start\ntrusting non-kin, there is no evolutionary advantage to trusting non-kin. And\nuntil there's an evolutionary advantage to trusting non-kin, people won't be\npredisposed to trust non-kin. Just as a single hawk in a Hawk-Dove game can\ntake advantage of everybody, a single dove in a Hawk-Dove game gets taken\nadvantage of by everybody. That is, the first trusting person who engages with\na group of untrustworthy people isn't going to do very well.\n\nIt turns out that cooperative behavior can overcome these problems.\nMathematical biologist Martin A. Nowak has explored the evolution of\ncooperation using mathematics, computer models, and experiments, and has found\nfour different mechanisms by which altruistic behavior can spontaneously\nevolve in [non-kin\ngroups](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1107797):\n\n  * Direct reciprocity. Being altruistic towards you now is a good strategy because you'll be altruistic towards me later.\n\n  * [Indirect reciprocity](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1108290). Being altruistic towards you now is a good strategy because my reputation as an altruistic individual will increase, and someone else will be altruistic towards me later.[26](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos933504)\n\n  * Network reciprocity. Being altruistic towards you now is a good strategy because we are both in a group whose members are altruistic to each other, and being part of that group means that someone else will be altruistic towards me later.\n\n  * Group selection. Being altruistic towards you now is a good strategy because we're both part of a group whose members are altruistic to each other, and our group of altruists is more likely to survive than a group of non-altruists.[27](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos933872)\n\nWhat methods work depend on how much it costs for one individual to help\nanother, how beneficial the help is, and how likely it is that helpful\nindividuals meet and recognize each other in the future. And, depending on\ndetails, there are several plausible [biological\nmodels](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1109112) of\nhow this sort of thing might have jump-started itself. Exactly how this\nevolved in humans is\ndebated.[28](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos934559)\nPhilosopher [Patricia\nChurchland](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1109517)\nsuggests four coexistent characteristics of our pre-human ancestors that make\nall of Nowak's mechanisms likely: “loose hierarchy and related easygoing\ntemperament, cooperative parenting extending to cooperating with the group,\nsexual selection, and lethal intergroup competition.” The last one is\nespecially interesting; [our\nmurderousness](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1109863)\nhelped make us cooperative.\n\nWhat's likely is that all six mechanisms—Nowak's four, kin selection, and\nZahavi's handicap principle—were working at the same time. Also that there was\na strong positive-feedback loop, as we became smarter and more social. Each\nindividual mechanism contributes a bit towards the evolution of cooperation,\nwhich makes resultant individuals better able to pass their genes on to the\nnext generation, which selects for a little more contribution from each\nmechanism, which makes resultant individuals even better able to pass their\ngenes on, and so on. [And these\nprocesses](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1110393),\nespecially group selection, work on both the genetic and cultural levels.\n\nWe became trustworthy, well…most of the time. We trusted others, well…most of\nthe time. And, as we'll see, we used security to fill in the gaps where\notherwise trust would fail. In a way, humans domesticated\nthemselves.[29](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos935427)\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Social History of Trust\n\nTrust is rare on this planet. Here's primatologist [Robert\nSapolsky](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1111079):\n\n> When baboons hunt together they'd love to get as much meat as possible, but\n> they're not very good at it.

We treat strangers fairly,\naltruistically sometimes. We put group interest ahead of our own selfishness.\nMore importantly, we control other people's selfish behaviors.\n\nWe do this through a combination of our own prosocial impulses and the\nsocietal pressures that keep us all in line. This is what allowed for the\nhunter-gatherer societies of prehistory, the civilization of history, and\ntoday's globalization.\n\nBut while our cultures evolved, our brains did not. As different as our lives\nare from those of the primitive hunter-gatherers who lived in Africa 100,000\nyears ago, genetically we have barely changed at\nall.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos936443) There\nsimply hasn't been enough time. As [Matt\nRidley](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1111400)\nwrites in The Red Queen:\n\n> Inside my skull is a brain that was designed to exploit the conditions of an\n> African savanna between 3 million and 100,000 years ago.

We've evolved for the trust\nproblem endemic to living in small family groups in the East African highlands\nin 100,000 BC. It's 21st century New York City that gives us\nproblems.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos938824)\n\nOur brains are sufficiently neuroplastic that we can adapt to today's world,\nbut vestiges of our evolutionary past remain. These cognitive biases affect\nhow we respond to fear, how we perceive risks (there's a whole list of them in\nChapter 15), and how we weigh short-term versus long-term costs and benefits.\nThat last one is particularly relevant to decisions about cooperation and\ndefection. Psychological studies show that we have what's called a [hyperbolic\ndiscounting](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1111734)\nrate: we often prefer lower payoffs sooner to higher payoffs later. As we saw\nin the previous chapter, decisions to cooperate often involve putting our\nlong-term interests ahead of our short-term interests. In some ways, this is\nunnatural for us.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nAs we saw in the previous chapter, any system of cooperators also includes\nsome defectors. So as we as a species became more cooperative, we evolved\nstrategies for dealing with defectors.\n\nMaking this happen isn't free. We have evolved a variety of different\nmechanisms to induce cooperation, the societal pressures I'll discuss in\nChapters 6 through 10. [Francis\nFukuyama](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1112314)\nwrote: “Widespread distrust in society…imposes a kind of tax on all forms of\neconomic activity, a tax that high-trust societies do not have to pay.” It's a\ntax on the honest. It's a tax imposed on ourselves by ourselves, because,\nhuman nature being what it is, too many of us would otherwise become hawks and\ntake advantage of the rest of us. And it's an expensive\ntax.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos939593)\n\n[James\nMadison](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1112658)\nfamously wrote: “If men were angels, no government would be necessary.” If men\nwere angels, no security would be necessary. Door locks, razor wire, tall\nfences, and burglar alarms wouldn't be necessary. Angels never go where\nthey're not supposed to go. Police forces wouldn't be necessary. Armies?\nCountries of angels would be able to resolve their differences peacefully, and\nmilitary expenses would be unnecessary.\n\nCurrency, that paper stuff that's deliberately made hard to counterfeit,\nwouldn't be necessary, as people could just write down how much money they\nhad.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos940182) Angels\nnever cheat, so nothing more would be required. Every security measure that\nisn't designed to be effective against accident, animals, forgetfulness, or\nlegitimate differences between scrupulously honest angels could be dispensed\nwith.\n\nWe wouldn't need police, judges, courtrooms, jails, and probation officers.\nDisputes would still need resolving, but we could get rid of everything\nassociated with investigating, prosecuting, and punishing crime. Fraud\ndetection would be unnecessary: the parts of our welfare and healthcare system\nthat make sure people fairly benefit from those services and don't abuse them;\nand all of the anti-shoplifting systems in retail stores.\n\nEntire industries would be unnecessary, like private security guards, security\ncameras, locksmithing, burglar alarms, automobile anti-theft, computer\nsecurity, corporate security, airport security, and so on. And those are just\nthe obvious ones; financial auditing, document authentication, and many other\nthings would also be unnecessary.\n\nNot being angels is expensive.\n\nWe don't pay a lot of these costs directly. The vast majority of them are\nhidden in the price of the things we buy. Groceries cost more because some\npeople shoplift. Plane tickets cost more because some people try to blow\nplanes up. Banks pay out lower interest rates because of fraud. Everything we\ndo or buy costs more because some sort of security is required to deliver it.\n\nEven greater are the non-monetary costs: less autonomy, reduced freedom,\nceding of authority, lost privacy, and so on. These trade-offs are subjective,\nof course, and some people value them more than others. But it's these costs\nthat lead to social collapse if they get too high.\n\nSecurity isn't just a tax on the honest, it's a very expensive tax on the\nhonest. If all men were angels, just think of the savings!\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nIt wasn't always like this. Security used to be cheap. Societal pressures used\nto be an incidental cost of society itself. Many of our societal pressures\nevolved far back in human prehistory, well before we had any societies larger\nthan extended family groups. We touched on these mechanisms in the previous\nchapter: both the moral mechanisms in our brains that internally regulate our\nbehavior, and the reputational mechanisms we all use to regulate each other's\nbehavior.\n\nMorals and reputation comprise our prehistoric toolbox of societal pressures.\nThey are informal, and operate at both conscious and subconscious levels in\nour brains: I refer to the pair of them, unenhanced by technology, as social\npressures. They evolved together, and as such are closely related and\nintertwined in our brains and societies. From a biological or behaviorist\nperspective, there's a reasonable argument that my distinction between moral\nand reputational systems is both arbitrary and illusory, and that\ndifferentiating the two doesn't make much sense. But from our perspective of\ninducing trust, they are very different.\n\nDespite the prevalence of war, violence, and general deceptiveness throughout\nhuman history—and the enormous amount of damage wrought by defectors—these\nancient moral and reputational systems have worked amazingly well. Most of us\ntry not to treat others unfairly, both because it makes us feel bad and\nbecause we know they'll treat us badly in return. Most of us don't steal, both\nbecause we feel guilty when we do and because there are consequences if we get\ncaught. Most of us are trustworthy towards strangers—within the realistic\nconstraints of the society we live in—because we recognize it's in our long-\nterm interest. And we trust strangers because we recognize it is in their\ninterest to act trustworthily. We don't want a reputation as an untrustworthy,\nor an untrusting, person.\n\nHere's an example from early human prehistory: two opposing tendencies that\nwould cause society to fall apart if individuals couldn't trust each other. On\none hand, we formed pair bonds for the purpose of child-rearing. On the other\nhand, we had a primarily gender-based division of labor that forced men and\nwomen to separate as they went about their different hunting and gathering\ntasks. This meant that primitive humans needed to trust that everyone honored\nthe integrity of these pair bonds, since individuals often couldn't be around\nto police them directly. The difficulty in resolving those opposing tendencies\nis known as Deacon's\nParadox.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos940614)\n\nNo, anthropologists don't have unrealistic views on the sanctity of marriage.\nThey know that illicit affairs go on all the\ntime.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos940945) But\nthey also realize that such indiscretions occur with much less frequency than\nthey would if mating weren't largely based on pair-\nbonding.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos941294)\nMost people are honest most of the time, and most pair bonds are respected\nmost of the time. Deacon singled out one particular human capability—the\nability to form symbolic contracts—as the particular mechanism that polices\nsexual fidelity. This isn't just about two people deciding to cohabitate,\nshare food, and produce and raise offspring. It's about two people making a\npublic declaration of commitment in marriage ceremonies, and enlisting other\nmembers of the community to simultaneously recognize and promote the stability\nof their pair bond. Because everyone has a stake in supporting sexual fidelity\nwithin the community, everyone keeps an eye on everyone else and punishes\nillicit matings.\n\nThis is an example of a social pressure. It's informal and ad hoc, but it\nprotects society as a whole against the potentially destabilizing individual\nactions of its members. It protects society from defectors, not by making them\ndisappear, but by keeping their successes down to a manageable rate. Without\nit, primitive humans wouldn't have trusted each other enough to establish\ngender-based division of labor and, consequently, could never have coalesced\ninto communities of both kith and kin.\n\nOther examples include being praised for good behavior, being gossiped about\nand snubbed socially for bad behavior, being shamed, shunned, killed, and—this\nis much the same as being killed—ostracized and cast out of the group.\n\nI'm omitting a lot of detail, and there are all sorts of open research\nquestions. How did these various social pressures evolve? When did they first\nappear, and how did their emergence separate us from the other primates—and\nother\nprotohumans?[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos942054)\nHow did trust affect intelligence, and how did intelligence affect trust? For\nour purposes, it's enough to say that they evolved to overcome our increased\ndeceptiveness and murderousness.\n\nIn a primitive society, these social pressures are good enough. When you're\nliving in a small community, and objects are few and hard to make, it's pretty\neasy to deal with the problem of theft. If Alice loses a bowl at the same time\nBob shows up with an identical bowl, everyone in the community knows that Bob\nstole it from Alice and can then punish Bob. The problem is that these\nmechanisms don't scale. As communities grow larger, as they get more complex,\nas social ties weaken and anonymity proliferates, this system of theft\nprevention—morals keeping most people honest, and informal detection, followed\nby punishment, leading to deterrence to keep the rest honest—starts to fail.\n\nRemember the Dunbar number? Actually, Dunbar proposed several natural human\ngroup sizes that increase by a factor of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150,\n500, and 1,500—although, really, the numbers aren't as precise as all that.\nThe layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationships, and the\nfrequency of contact.\n\nThe smallest, three to five, is a clique: the number of people from whom you\nwould seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The 12-to-20 person\ngroup is the sympathy group: people with whom you have a particularly close\nrelationship. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer\novernight camps, generally drawn from a single pool of 150 people. The\n500-person group is the megaband, and the 1,500-person group is the tribe;\nboth terms are common in ethnographic literature. Fifteen hundred is roughly\nthe number of faces we can recognize, and the typical size of a hunter-\ngatherer\nsociety.[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos942644)\n\nEvolutionary psychologists are still debating Dunbar's findings, and whether\nthere are as [many distinct\nlevels](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1112922) as\nDunbar postulates. Regardless of how this all shakes out, for our purposes\nit's enough to notice that as we move from smaller group sizes to larger ones,\nour informal social pressures [begin to\nfail](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1113311),\nnecessitating the development of more formal ones. A family doesn't need\nformal rules for sharing food, but a larger group in a communal dining hall\nwill. Small communities don't need birth registration procedures, marriages\ncertified by an authority, laws of inheritance, or rules governing real-estate\ntransfer; larger communities do. Small companies don't need employee name\nbadges, because everyone already knows everyone else; larger companies need\nthem and many other rules besides.\n\nTo put it another way, our trust needs are a function of scale. As the number\nof people we dealt with increased, we no longer knew them well enough to be\nable to trust their intentions, so our prehistoric trust toolbox started\nfailing. As we developed agriculture and needed to trust more people over\nincreased distance—physical distance, temporal distance, emotional distance—we\nneeded additional societal pressures to elicit trustworthiness at this new\nscale. As the number of those interactions increased, and as the potential\ndamage the group could do to the individual increased, we needed even more. If\nhumans were incapable of developing these more formal societal pressures,\nsocieties either would have stopped growing or would have disintegrated\nentirely.\n\nFigure 5: Dunbar Numbers\n\n![5](images/00008.jpg)\n\nAgriculture required protecting resources, through violence if necessary.\nLuckily, two things happened. We invented institutions—government,\nbasically—and we developed technology. Both of them allowed for human\nsocieties to grow larger without tearing themselves apart.\n\nInstitutions formalized reputational pressure. With government came laws,\nenforcement, and formal punishment. I'm not implying that the original purpose\nof government was facilitating trust, only that part of what these formal\ninstitutions did was codify the existing societal norms. This codification is\na trust mechanism.\n\nHistory has forgotten all of these early institutions. Some were undoubtedly\ncivil. Some were\nreligious.[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos943305)\nNo one knows the details of how our ancestors made the transition from an\nextended family to a tribe of several extended families, because they happened\nthousands of years before anyone got around to inventing writing. Certainly\nthere's overlap between formal reputational and early institutional pressures.\nIt's enough to say that we made the transition, and that we augmented moral\nand reputational pressures with institutional\npressures.[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos943785)\n\nThis was a critical development, one that gives us the ability to trust\npeople's actions, even if we can't trust their intentions. We reinforced our\ninformal recognition of pair bonds with formal marriage through religious and\ncivil institutions. We added laws about theft, and prescribed specific\npunishments. A lot of this, at least initially, is formalizing reputational\nmechanisms so that they scale to larger groups. But something important\nhappens in the transition: institutional pressures require institutions to\nimplement them. Society has to designate a subset of individuals to enforce\nthe laws. Think of elders, guards, police forces, and judicial systems;\npriests also take on this role.\n\nInstitutions also enabled the formation of groups of groups, and subgroups\nwithin groups. So small tribes could become part of larger political\ngroupings. Individual churches could become part of a larger religious\norganization. Companies could have divisions. Government organizations could\nhave departments. Empires could form, and remain stable over many generations.\nInstitutions scale in a way that morals and reputation do not, and this has\nallowed societies to grow at a rate never before seen on the planet.\n\nThe second force that allowed society to scale was technology—both technology\nin general and security technology specifically. Security systems are the\nfinal way we induce trust. Early security mechanisms included building earthen\nberms, wearing animal skins as camouflage, and digging pit traps. In one\nsense, security isn't anything new; we learned in Chapter 2 that it's been\naround almost as long as life itself. That primitive sort of security is what\nyou might call natural defenses, focused on the individual. But when societies\ngot together and realized they could, as a group, implement security systems,\nsecurity became a form of societal pressure. In a sense, security technologies\nallow natural defenses to scale to protect against intra-group defection.\n\nTechnology also allowed informal social pressures to scale and become what I\ncall societal pressures. Morals could be written down and passed from\ngeneration to generation. Reputation could similarly be recorded, and\ntransferred from one person to another. This sort of thing depends a lot on\ntechnology: from the Bible and letters of introduction, to online debates on\nmorality, to entries on the Angie's List database.\n\nA good way to think about it is that both institutional pressure and security\nsystems allow us to overcome the limitations of the Dunbar numbers by enabling\npeople to trust systems instead of people. Instead of having to trust\nindividual merchants, people can trust the laws that regulate merchants.\nInstead of having to evaluate the trustworthiness of individual borrowers,\nbanks and other lending institutions can trust the credit rating system.\nInstead of trusting that people won't try to rob my house, I can trust the\nlocks on my doors and—if I want to turn it on—my burglar alarm.\n\nTechnology changes the efficacy of societal pressures in another way as well.\nAs soon as the different systems of societal pressure themselves need to be\nsecured, it becomes possible for a defector to attack those security systems\ndirectly. Once there's a technologically enhanced system of reputational\npressure, that system needs to be protected with security technology. So we\nneed signet rings and wax seals to secure letters of introduction, and\ncomputer security measures that keep the Angie's List database from being\nhacked. Similarly, once forensic measures exist to help enforce laws, those\nforensic measures can be directly targeted. So burglars wear gloves to keep\nfrom leaving fingerprints, and file down VINs to prevent stolen cars from\nbeing tracked.\n\nThere's a bigger change that results from society's increased scale. As\nsociety moved from informal social pressures to more formal societal\npressures—whether institutional pressures and security systems, or\ntechnologically enhanced moral and reputational pressures—the nature of trust\nchanged. Recall our two definitions of trust from Chapter 1: trust of\nintentions and trust of actions. In smaller societies, we are usually\nconcerned with trust in the first definition. We're intimately familiar with\nthe people we're interacting with, and have a good idea about their\nintentions. The social pressures induce cooperation in specific instances, but\nare also concerned with their overall intentions. As society grows and social\nties weaken, we lose this intimacy and become more concerned with trust in the\nsecond definition. We don't know who we're interacting with, and have no idea\nabout their intentions, so we concern ourselves with their actions. Societal\npressures become more about inducing specific actions: compliance.\n\nCompliance isn't as good as actual trustworthiness, but it's good enough. Both\nelicit trust.\n\nAlso through history, technology allowed specialization, which encouraged\nlarger group sizes. For example, a single farmer could grow enough to sustain\nmore people, permitting even greater specialization. In this and other ways,\ngeneral technological innovations enabled society to grow even larger and more\ncomplex. Dunbar's numbers remain constant, but postal services, telegraph,\nradio, telephone, television, and now the Internet have allowed us to interact\nwith more people than ever before. Travel has grown increasingly fast and\nincreasingly long distance over the millennia, and has allowed us to meet more\npeople face-to-face. Countries have gotten larger, and there are multinational\nquasi-governmental organizations. Governments have grown more sophisticated.\nOrganizations have grown larger and more geographically dispersed. Businesses\nhave gotten larger; now there are multinational corporations employing\nhundreds of thousands of people controlling assets across several continents.\nIf your Facebook account has substantially more than 150 friends, you probably\nonly have a superficial connection with many of\nthem.[12](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos944644)\n\nTechnology also increases societal complexity. Automation and mass\ndistribution mean one person can affect more people and more of the planet.\nLong-distance communication, transport, and travel mean that people can affect\neach other even if they're far away. Governments have gotten larger, both in\nterms of geographical area and level of complexity. Computer and networking\ntechnology mean that things happen faster, and information that might once\nhave been restricted to specialists can be made available to a worldwide\naudience. These further increases in scale have a major effect on societal\npressures, as we'll see in Chapter 16.\n\nNone of this is to say that societal pressures result in a fair, equitable, or\nmoral society. The [Code of\nHammurabi](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1113656)\nfrom 1700 BC, the first written code of laws in human history, contains some\nlaws that would be considered barbaric today: if a son strikes his father, his\nhands shall be hewn off; if anyone commits a robbery and is caught, he shall\nbe put to death; if anyone brings an accusation of any crime before the\nelders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if a capital offense\nis charged, be put to death. And world history is filled with governments that\nhave oppressed, persecuted, and even massacred their own people. There's\nnothing to guarantee that the majority actually approves of these laws;\nsocietal interest and societal norms might be dictated by an authoritarian\nruler. The only thing societal pressures guarantee is that, in the short run\nat least, society doesn't fall apart.\n\nFurthermore, societal pressures protect a society from change: bad, good, and\nindeterminate. Cooperators are, by definition, those who follow the group\nnorm. They put the group interest ahead of any competing interests, and by\ndoing so, make it harder for the group norm to change. If the group norm is\nunsustainable, this can fatally harm society in the long run.\n\nRemember that society as a whole isn't the only group we're concerned about\nhere. Societal pressures can be found in any group situation. They're how a\ngroup of friends protect themselves from greedy people at communal dinners.\nThey enable criminal organizations to protect themselves from loose cannons\nand potential turncoats within their own ranks. And they're how a military\nprotects itself from deserters and insubordinates, and how corporations\nprotect themselves from embezzling employees.\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nSocietal Dilemmas\n\nHere are some questions related to trust:\n\n  * During a natural disaster, should I steal a big-screen TV? What about food to feed my family?\n\n  * As a kamikaze pilot, should I refuse to kill myself? What if I'm just a foot soldier being ordered to attack a heavily armed enemy bunker?\n\n  * As a company employee, should I work hard or slack off? What if the people around me are slacking off and getting away with it? What if my job is critical and, by slacking off, I harm everyone else's year-end bonuses?\n\nThere's a risk trade-off at the heart of every one of these questions. When\ndeciding whether to cooperate and follow the group norm, or defect and follow\nsome competing norm, an individual has to weigh the costs and benefits of each\noption. I'm going to use a construct I call a societal dilemma to capture the\ntension between group interest and a competing interest.\n\nWhat makes something a societal dilemma, and not just an individual's free\nchoice to do whatever he wants and risk the consequences, is that there are\nsocietal repercussions of the trade-off. Society as a whole cares about the\ndilemma, because if enough people defect, something extreme happens. It might\nbe bad, like widespread famine, or it might be good, like civil rights. But\nsince a societal dilemma is from the point of view of societal norms, by\ndefinition it's in society's collective best interest to ensure widespread\ncooperation.\n\nLet's start with the smallest society possible: two people. Another model from\ngame theory works here. It's called the Prisoner's\nDilemma.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos945913)\n\nAlice and Bob are partners in crime, and they've both been arrested for\nburglary.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos946557)\nThe police don't have enough evidence to convict either of them, so they bring\nthem into separate interrogation rooms and offer each one a deal. “If you\nbetray your accomplice and agree to testify against her,” the policeman says,\n“I'll let you go free and your partner will get ten years in jail. If you both\nbetray each other, we don't need your testimony, and you'll each get six years\nin jail. But if you cooperate with your partner and both refuse to say\nanything, I can only convict you on a minor charge—one year in\njail.”[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos947067)\n\nNeither Alice nor Bob is fully in charge of his or her own destiny, since the\noutcome for each depends on the other's decision. Neither has any way of\nknowing, or influencing, the other's decision; and they don't trust each\nother.\n\nImagine Alice evaluating her two options: “If Bob stays silent,” she thinks,\n“then it would be in my best interest to testify against him. It's a choice\nbetween no jail time versus one year in jail, and that's an easy choice.\nSimilarly, if Bob rats on me, it's also in my interest to testify. That's a\nchoice between six years in jail versus ten years in jail. Because I have no\ncontrol over Bob's decision, testifying gives me the better outcome,\nregardless of what he chooses to do. It's obviously in my best interest to\nbetray Bob: to confess and agree to testify against him.” That's what she\ndecides to do.\n\nBob, in a holding cell down the hall, is evaluating the same options. He goes\nthrough the same reasoning—he doesn't care about Alice any more than she cares\nabout him—and arrives at the same conclusion.\n\nSo both Alice and Bob confess. The police no longer need either one to testify\nagainst the other, and each spends six years in jail. But here's the rub: if\nthey had both remained silent, each would have spent only one year in jail.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Prisoners confessing.  \n---  \nSociety: A group of two prisoners.  \nGroup interest: Minimize total jail time for all involved. | Competing interest: Minimize individual jail time.  \nGroup norm: To cooperate with the other prisoner and remain silent. | Corresponding defection: Testify against the other.  \n  \nThe Prisoner's Dilemma encapsulates the conflict between group interest and\nself-interest. As a pair, Alice and Bob are best off if they both remain\nsilent and spend only one year in jail. But by each following his or her own\nself-interest, they both end up with worse outcomes individually.\n\nThe only way they can end up with the best outcome—one year in jail, as\nopposed to six, or ten—is by acting in their group interest. Of course, that\nonly makes sense if each can trust the other to do the same. But Alice and Bob\ncan't.\n\nBorrowing a term from economics, the other prisoner's jail time is an\nexternality. That is, it's an effect of a decision not borne by the decision\nmaker. To Alice, Bob's jail time is an externality. And to Bob, Alice's jail\ntime is an externality.\n\nI like the prisoner story because it's a reminder that cooperation doesn't\nimply anything moral; it just means going along with the group norm.\nSimilarly, defection doesn't necessarily imply anything immoral; it just means\nputting some competing interest ahead of the group interest.\n\nBasic commerce is another type of Prisoner's Dilemma, although you might not\nhave thought about it that way before. Cognitive scientist [Douglas\nHofstadter](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1114110)\nliked this story better than prisoners, confessions, and jail time.\n\n> Two people meet and exchange closed bags, with the understanding that one of\n> them contains money, and the other contains a purchase. Either player can\n> choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what he or she\n> agreed, or he or she can defect by handing over an empty bag.\n\nIt's easy to see one trust mechanism that keeps merchants from cheating: their\nreputations as merchants. It's also easy to see a measure that keeps customers\nfrom cheating: they're likely to be arrested or at least barred from the\nstore. These are examples of societal pressures, and they'll return in the\nnext chapters.\n\nThis example illustrates something else that's important: societal dilemmas\nare not always symmetrical. The merchant and a customer have different roles,\nand different options for cooperating and defecting. They also have different\nincentives to defect, and different competing norms.\n\nHere's a societal dilemma involving two companies. They are selling identical\nproducts at identical prices, with identical customer service and everything\nelse. Sunoco and Amoco gasoline, perhaps. They are the only companies selling\nthose products, and there's a fixed number of customers for them to divvy up.\nThe only way they can increase their market share is by advertising, and any\nincrease in market share comes at the expense of the other company's. For\nsimplicity's sake, assume that each can spend either a fixed amount on\nadvertising or none at all; there isn't a variable amount of advertising\nspending that they can do. Also assume that if one advertises and the other\ndoes not, the company that advertises gains an increase in market share that\nmore than makes up for the advertising investment. If both advertise, their\ninvestments cancel each other out and market share stays the same for each.\nHere's the question: advertise or not?\n\nIt's the same risk trade-off as before. From Alice's perspective, if she\nadvertises and Bob does not, she increases her market share. But if she\ndoesn't advertise and Bob does, she loses market share. She's better off\nadvertising, regardless of what Bob does. Bob makes the same trade-off, so\nthey both end up advertising and see no change in market share, when they\nwould both have been better off saving their money.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Advertising.  \n---  \nSociety: Two companies selling the same product.  \nGroup interest: Maximize profits. | Competing interest: Maximize profits at the expense of the other company.  \nGroup norm: To not engage in a costly and fruitless advertising arms race, and not advertise. | Corresponding defection: Advertise.  \n  \nThis is your basic arms race, in which the various factions expend effort just\nto stay in the same place relative to each other. The USA and the USSR did\nthis during the Cold War. Rival political parties do it, too.\n\nIf you assume the individuals can switch between strategies and you set the\nparameters right, the Hawk-Dove game is a Prisoner's Dilemma. When pairs of\nindividuals interact, they each have the choice of cooperating (being a dove)\nor defecting (being a hawk). Both individuals know that cooperating is the\nbest strategy for them as a pair, but that individually they're each better\noff being a hawk.\n\nNot every interaction between two people involves a Prisoner's Dilemma.\nImagine two drivers who are both stuck because a tree is blocking the road.\nThe tree is too heavy for one person to move on his own, but it can be moved\nif they work together. Here, there's no conflict. It is in both their selfish\ninterest and their group interest to move the tree together. But Prisoner's\nDilemmas are common, and once you're primed to notice them, you'll start\nseeing them\neverywhere.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos947374)\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThe basic Prisoner's Dilemma formula involves two people who must decide\nbetween their own self-interest and the interest of their two-person group.\nThis is interesting—and has been studied\nextensively[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos947785)—but\nit's too simplistic for our purposes. We are more concerned with scenarios\ninvolving larger groups, with dozens, hundreds, thousands, even millions of\npeople in a single dilemma.\n\nHere's a classic societal dilemma: overfishing. As long as you don't catch too\nmany fish in any area, the remaining fish can breed fast enough to keep up\nwith demand. But if you start taking too many fish out of the water, the\nremaining fish can't breed fast enough and the whole population collapses.\n\nIf there were only one fisher, she could decide how much fish to catch based\non both her immediate and long-term interests. She could catch all the fish\nshe was able to in one year, and make a lot of money. Or she could catch fewer\nfish this year, making less money, but ensuring herself an income for years to\ncome. It's a pretty easy decision to make—assuming she's not engaged in\nsubsistence fishing—and you can imagine that in most instances, the fisher\nwould not sacrifice her future livelihood for a short-term gain.\n\nBut as soon as there's more than one boat in the water, things become more\ncomplicated. Each fisher not only has to worry about overfishing the waters\nherself, but whether the other fishers are doing the same. There's a societal\ndilemma at the core of each one of their decisions.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Overfishing.  \n---  \nSociety: A group of fishers all fishing out of the same waters.  \nGroup interest: The productivity of the fishing waters over the long term. | Competing interest: Short-term profit.  \nGroup norm: To limit individual catches. | Corresponding defection: Take more than your share of fish.  \n  \nFisher Alice's trade-off includes the same elements as Prisoner Alice's trade-\noff. Alice can either act in her short-term self-interest and catch a lot of\nfish, or act in the group interest of all the local fishers and catch fewer\nfish. If everyone else acts in the group interest, then Alice is better off\nacting in her own selfish interest. She'll catch more fish, and fishing stocks\nwill remain strong because she's the only one overfishing. But if Alice acts\nin the group interest while others act in their self-interest, she'll have\nsacrificed her own short-term gain for nothing: she'll catch fewer fish, and\nthe fishing stocks will still collapse due to everyone else's overfishing.\n\nHer analysis leads to the decision to overfish. That makes sense, but—of\ncourse—if everyone acts according to the same analysis, they'll end up\ncollapsing the fishing stocks and ruining the industry for everyone. This is\ncalled a Tragedy of the Commons, and was first described by the ecologist\nGarrett Hardin in\n1968.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos948117)\n\nA Tragedy of the Commons occurs whenever a group shares a limited resource:\nnot just fisheries, but grazing lands, water rights, time on a piece of shared\nexercise equipment at a gym, an unguarded plate of cookies in the kitchen. In\na forest, you can cut everything down for maximum short-term profit, or\nselectively harvest for sustainability. Someone who owns the forest can make\nthe trade-off for himself, but when an unorganized group together owns the\nforest there's no one to limit the harvest, and a Tragedy of the Commons can\nresult.\n\nA Tragedy of the Commons is more complicated than a two-person Prisoner's\nDilemma, because the other fishers aren't making this decision collectively.\nInstead, each individual fisher decides for himself what to do. In the two-\nperson dilemma, Alice had to try to predict what Bob would do. In this larger\ndilemma, many more outcomes are possible.\n\nAssume there are 100 fishers in total. Any number from 0 through 100 could act\nin their selfish interest and overfish. Harm to the group would increase as\nthe scope of overfishing increases, regardless of what Alice does. Alice would\nprobably not be harmed at all by 1 fisher overfishing, and she would be\nsignificantly harmed if all 99 chose to do the same. Fifty overfishers would\ncause some amount of harm; 20, a lesser amount. There are degrees of\noverfishing. Twenty fishers who each overfish by a small amount might do less\ndamage to the fish stocks than 5 who take everything they can out of the\nwater. What matters here is the scope of defection: the number of overfishers,\nbut also the frequency of overfishing, and the magnitude of each overfishing\nincident.\n\nAt some scope of defection, stocks will be so depleted that everyone's catch\nin future years will be jeopardized. There's more at stake than whether Alice\ngets her fair share. In game theory, this is called a non-zero-sum game\nbecause wins and losses don't add up to zero: there are outcomes where\neveryone loses, and loses\nbig.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos951216) A\nfishery is non-zero-sum. Other societal dilemmas might seem like zero-sum\ngames with a finite resource: if one person takes more, others get less. But\neven in these instances, there is a potential for catastrophe in widespread\ndefection. If a community can't share a common water resource, everyone's\ncrops will die because farmers can't plan on water use. If a few people\nconstantly hog the exercise equipment, others won't come to the gym, which\nwill lose membership and close. If someone consistently takes all the cookies,\nMother will stop baking them. Remember: it's a bad parasite that kills its\nhost.\n\nThe non-zero-sum property is an essential aspect of a societal dilemma. The\ngroup result barely depends on any single person's actions. Alice's\ncooperation or defection doesn't appreciably change the number of overfishers,\nnor is it likely to collapse the fishing stocks. It's the actions of the group\nthat determine the overall result; at some point, the effects of the\noverfishers on the group will change from nothing to irreversible damage.\n\nIt's also possible that the group will not reach that point, even if all the\nmembers take as much fish as they want. There might not be enough fishers in\nthe waters, or fishing technology might not be efficient enough. All the\nmembers of the group might be able to fish as much as they possibly can\nwithout affecting each other or future fishing stocks. But at some point,\neither the waters will get crowded enough or the fishers will get\ntechnologically advanced enough that the Tragedy of the Commons dilemma will\noccur.\n\nThe disconnect between Alice's individual actions and the effect of the\ngroup's actions as a whole makes societal dilemmas even harder to solve in\nlarger groups. Under a rational economic analysis, it makes no sense for Alice\nto cooperate. The group will do whatever it does, regardless of her actions,\nand her individual cooperation or defection won't change that. All she's\nreally deciding is whether to seize or forgo the short-term benefits of\ndefecting.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Tragedy of the Commons.  \n---  \nSociety: Some group of people, either a society of interest or a society of\ncircumstance.  \nGroup interest: That the common resource not run out, and be available for all. | Competing interest: Get as much of that resource as possible in the short term.  \nGroup norm: Cooperate and share that resource within its sustainability limits.. | Corresponding defection: Take as much of that shared resource as you can.  \n  \nIn a Tragedy of the Commons, people acting in their self-interest harm the\ngroup interest. There's another type of societal dilemma, where people can\nreceive the benefit of those who act in the group interest without having to\nact in the group interest themselves. It's called the [free-rider\nproblem](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1114414).\n\n[Whooping\ncough](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1114814)\n(otherwise known as pertussis) is a good example. It's both almost entirely\npreventable and almost entirely untreatable. Early in the 20th century, before\nthe establishment of widespread vaccination programs, it was one of the most\nfeared illnesses, and it remains a significant cause of death in developing\ncountries. Compared to other vaccines, the pertussis vaccine isn't actually\nvery effective at conferring immunity to any one individual. The stan-dard\ninfant schedule calls for four shots. After the first shot, about 30% become\nimmune; after two, 50%; and even after all four shots have been administered,\nonly about 90% of individuals have enough antibodies to fight off the disease.\n\nWhat's more, vaccination is not without risk. The original pertussis vaccine\ncarried a small risk of neurological damage. It has since been replaced with a\nsafer vaccine, but a minuscule risk of adverse reactions still persists, as it\ndoes with any vaccine. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, adverse vaccine\nreactions received a lot of attention in the media, most notably in Sweden,\nJapan, and the UK. Parents began to refuse vaccinations for their children,\nand doctors were often powerless to persuade them that the benefits outweighed\nthe risks.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of vaccination is herd immunity. If almost\neveryone is vaccinated against a particular disease, there's no way for it to\ntake hold in the community. Even if someone gets the disease, it's unlikely he\nwill be able to infect others. Parents who refuse to have their children\nvaccinated do not only endanger their own children; they increase the risk of\ninfection for everyone in the community. This increases, of course, as more\nparents opt out of vaccination programs. And while this is true for any\nvaccinated disease, the danger is particularly acute for whooping cough\nbecause the vaccine doesn't confer complete immunity and isn't recommended for\nthe youngest infants or for those who are immune-compromised.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1979, the rate of pertussis vaccination among Swedish infants\ndropped precipitously, from 90% to 12%. Correspondingly, the incidence of\nwhooping cough in Swedish children under four skyrocketed from 0.05% in\n1975—effectively zero—to 3.4% by 1983. Sweden went from a country that had all\nbut eradicated whooping cough to a country with a 1 in 30 infection rate.\n\nWhen parents decide whether or not to immunize their child, they are faced\nwith a societal dilemma. They can choose to cooperate and vaccinate their\nchild, or they can choose to defect and refuse. As long as most children are\nvaccinated, a child is better off not being immunized: he avoids the chance of\nadverse effects, but reaps the benefit of herd immunity. But if there are too\nmany defectors, everyone suffers the increased risk of epidemics. And it's a\nnon-zero-sum game; there's a point where epidemics suddenly become much more\nlikely.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Vaccination.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: No epidemics. | Competing interest: Avoid the small risk of adverse side effects (encephalopathy, allergic or autoimmune reactions, or—in extreme cases—contracting the disease from the vaccination).  \nGroup norm: Vaccinate. | Corresponding defection: Avoid vaccination.  \n  \nA free rider receives the benefit of everyone else's cooperation without\nhaving to cooperate himself. Think of a single person in the community who\ndoesn't pay his taxes; he gets all the benefits of the public institutions\nthose taxes pay for—police and fire departments, road construction and\nmaintenance, regulations to keep his food and workplace safe, a\nmilitary—without having to actually pay for them.\n\nBut as more and more people stop paying their taxes, the government can\nprovide fewer and fewer of those services—services that would be much more\nexpensive or impossible for individuals to provide on their own—and the\nbenefit of free riding is reduced. In the extreme, the whole system collapses.\n\nImagine a condominium without smoke detectors. The first tenant to install one\nis a sucker, because even though he pays for his detector, the building can\nburn down from a fire started elsewhere. The last tenant to install one is a\nfool, because he already receives the benefits of everyone else's detectors\nwithout having to pay anything.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nIt's easy to dismiss those original two-person examples as the responsibility\nof the two people alone. Alice and Bob can decide whether to rat on each other\nin jail, or whether to cheat each other when they buy and sell sealed bags. No\none else needs to get involved. There's certainly no reason for society to get\ninvolved. Let the buyer and seller beware.\n\nSociety becomes involved because a broader societal dilemma emerges from\nAlice's and Bob's decisions. Let's look at the sealed bag exchange, focusing\non customer Alice. She can either cooperate by paying for her purchase, or\ndefect by defrauding merchant Bob. Yes, that decision most directly affects\nBob, but—thinking more broadly about theft and society—it affects everyone.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Defrauding merchants.  \n---  \nSociety: Those who buy and sell goods.  \nGroup interest: For commerce to operate smoothly. | Competing interest: Get stuff without having to pay for it.  \nGroup norm: Don't defraud merchants. | Corresponding defection: Defraud merchants.  \n  \nIt's not that society cares about any particular thief; rather, society wants\nproperty rights to be respected. Note that it doesn't matter what sort of\nproperty rights deserve respect. There could be communal property, there could\nbe personal property, and there could be everything in-between. What's\nimportant for society is for everyone to respect what society decides are the\nproperty rules that make collective life work, and then for everybody to be\nable to trust that those rules will be\nfollowed.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos951550)\n\nSimilarly, if we focus on merchant Bob, we can see that he is in a\ncorresponding societal dilemma with the society composed of all the other\nmerchants: he can either treat his customers fairly or he can defraud them.\nSociety doesn't want dishonest merchants; not only because we don't want to be\ndefrauded, but also because we know that our entire system of commerce hinges\non trust.\n\nThe alternative just wouldn't work. Merchants would stop doing transactions\nwith all customers, not just with Alice. And customers would stop doing\ntransactions with all merchants. Or they could both implement expensive and\ntime-consuming bag-checking procedures that require them to each hire someone\nto help them perform transactions. And so on. Without trust, commerce\ncollapses.\n\nEven prisoners can have a broader community with a stake in whether or not\nprisoners confess. A criminal organization won't be concerned with Alice or\nBob personally, but with members' loyalty to the organization. The\norganization as a whole benefits if it is viewed by individual members as an\nassociation in which they can trust others to keep their secrets, even at\ngreat personal cost.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Criminals testifying against each other.  \n---  \nSociety: The criminal organization.  \nGroup interest: To minimize the amount of jail time for the society. | Competing interest: To minimize personal jail time.  \nGroup norm: Don't testify against each other. | Corresponding defection: Testify against each other in exchange for reduced jail time.  \n  \nThe interesting thing about these dilemmas is that, looking at them in\nisolation, there's no logical solution. Thinking back to the prisoners, there\nis no analysis by which cooperation makes sense. Because they can't trust each\nother, they both end up confessing. This is the fundamental problem with\ncooperation: trust is unnatural, and it's not in the individual's short-term\nself-interest. This problem is why cooperation is so rare in the natural\nworld, why it took so long to develop in humans, and why we have developed\nsocietal pressures as a way to enforce cooperation and hold society together.\n\n\nPart II\n\nA Model of Trust\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nSocietal Pressures\n\nIn game theory, Prisoner's Dilemmas have no solution. Because the two\nprisoners, or the merchant and customer, can't trust each other, they both end\nup defecting. The larger societal dilemmas—the arms race, the Tragedy of the\nCommons, and the free-rider problem—are similarly unsolvable. Defecting is the\nonly course that makes logical sense, even though the end result will be\ndisastrous for the entire group.\n\nBut that's not how people generally operate. We cooperate all the time. We\nengage in honest commerce, although Enron and AIG and Countrywide are some\npretty spectacular exceptions. Most of us [don't\noverfish](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1115273),\neven though the few of us who do have depleted the ocean's stocks. We mostly\nvaccinate our children, despite the minor risk of an adverse reaction.\nSometimes, even, we don't rat on each other in\nprison.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos952021)\n\nPrisoner's Dilemmas involve a risk trade-off between group interest and self-\ninterest, but it's generally only a dilemma if you look at it very narrowly.\nFor most people, most of the time, there's no actual dilemma. We don't stand\nat the checkout line at a store thinking: “Either the merchant is selling me a\nbig screen TV, or this box is secretly filled with rocks. If it's rocks, I'm\nbetter off giving him counterfeit money. And if it has a TV, I'm still better\noff giving him counterfeit money.” Generally, we just pay for the TV, put it\nin our car, and drive home. And if we're professional check forgers, we don't\nthink through the dilemma, either. We pay for the TV with a bad check, put it\nin our car—I suppose it's a getaway car this time—and drive back to our lair.\n\nThe problem isn't with people; the problem is with the\ndilemma.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos952498)\nSocietal dilemmas are choices between group interest and some competing\nindividual interest. It assumes the individuals are only trying to minimize\ntheir jail time, or maximize their fishing catch or short-term profits. But in\nthe real world, people are more complicated than that. Our competing interests\nare more nuanced and varied, and they're subjective and situational. We try to\nmaximize things other than our selfish self-interest. And our societal\ndilemmas are part of our ongoing relationships with other people.\n\nSociety solves societal dilemmas by making it in people's best interest to act\nin the group interest. We do this so naturally and so easily that we don't\neven notice the dilemma. Because of laws and police, it's not obviously better\nto steal a big screen TV than go without. Because of how everyone will react,\nit's not obviously smarter to betray a friend. Sure, no jail time is better\nthan risking six years in jail, and catching more fish is better than catching\nfewer fish, but even those assessments fail to capture the richness of human\nemotion. Is no jail time but a reputation as a stool pigeon better than six\nyears in jail? Is catching more fish but contributing to the degradation of\nthe oceans better than catching fewer fish, even if everyone else is catching\nmore than you? It depends. It depends on who you are. It depends on what you\nare. It depends on where you are.\n\nAnother famous dilemma illustrates this. The Stag Hunt was first formulated by\n[Jean-Jacques\nRousseau](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1116104) in\n1754. In his scenario, a small group of hunters—it could be two and it could\nbe more; it doesn't matter—are hunting a stag together. As would be obvious to\nreaders of his day, everyone needs to work together in order to pull this off.\n\n> If it was a matter of hunting deer, everyone well realized that he must\n> remain at his post; but if a rabbit happened to pass within reach of one of\n> them, we cannot doubt that he would have gone off in pursuit of it without\n> scruple and, having caught his own prey, he would have cared very little\n> about having caused his companions to lose theirs.\n\nWhat makes this different than the Prisoner's Dilemma is that the benefit of\ncooperation is more than the benefit of defection: a stag is much more food,\neven divided a few ways, than a rabbit. It would seem there's no actual\ndilemma; for all players, cooperate–cooperate is better than any other option.\nIn the real world, however, [defections\nhappen](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1116501) in\nthis sort of cooperative game all the time. It seems to make no sense.\n\nRousseau, too, ignored the variety and subjectivity of the hunters' competing\ninterests. It's not obvious—for all people all the time—that a share of a stag\nis better than a whole rabbit. Sure, it's more meat, but that's not the only\nconsideration. First of all, the stag isn't a done deal. The choice is between\na guaranteed rabbit—they're small and easy to catch—and the possibility, maybe\neven the probability, of a share of a stag. Is our intrepid hunter Alice an\noptimist or a pessimist? Does she want to stalk stag for hours, or does she\nwant to snare her rabbit, go home, and do something she really enjoys with the\nrest of her day? Maybe she's tired. Maybe she's bored. Maybe she doesn't even\nlike the taste of stag, and has a great rabbit stew recipe she's been dying to\ntry. (Me, I like the one in Julia Child's The Way to Cook.) Maybe she is happy\nto forgo the rabbit for a stag, but doesn't trust that her fellow hunters will\ndo the same. The point is that it's not for Rousseau to conclude which of\nthese considerations matter to the hunters; the hunters get to decide for\nthemselves. And they're all going to decide differently.\n\nAnother dilemma is called the [Snowdrift\nDilemma](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1116829),\nsometimes called\nChicken.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos952848)\nTwo drivers are trapped by a snowdrift; each can either cooperate by shoveling\nor defect by remaining in his own car. If both remain in their cars, both\nremain stuck. If at least one of them shovels, both are freed; and two\nshovelers will get the job done much faster and more reliably than one. But\nunlike a Prisoner's Dilemma, it's in each driver's best interest to cooperate,\neven if the other\ndefects.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos954080)\n\nIt turns out there are several different\ndilemmas[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos954453)—generally\ncalled [social\ndilemmas](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1117239) or\ncoordination games—whose differences depend on the relative value of the\nvarious outcomes. Those nuances make a huge difference to game theorists, but\nare less important to everyday people. We make trade-offs based on what we\nwant to do.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos954973)\n\nWhen you look at the details of players' competing interests, motivations, and\npriorities, you often realize they might not be playing the same game. What\nmight be a Prisoner's Dilemma for Alice could be a Snowdrift for Bob. What\nmight be a Snowdrift for Alice might be a Stag Hunt for Bob. For Alice,\ncooperating might be the obviously smart thing to do. She might feel bad about\nherself if she defected. She might be afraid of what her friends would think\nif she defected. There might be a law against defecting, and she might not\nwant to risk the jail time. She'll have her own particular trade-off: her own\nsubjective values about cooperating and defecting. Bob might cooperate or\ndefect for completely different reasons. And even if Bob and Alice are playing\nthe same game today, they might each play a different game tomorrow. The\ncomplexities of these societal dilemmas are [much more\ncomplicated](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1117668)\nthan simple game theory models.\n\nThink back to the baboon story at the start of Chapter 4. Notice the societal\ndilemma:\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Gazelle hunting.  \n---  \nSociety: Society of baboons.  \nGroup interest: Tasty gazelle meat for everyone. | Competing interest: Gaining an advantage over a fellow baboon.  \nGroup norm: Hunt cooperatively. | Corresponding defection: Attack a fellow baboon during the hunt.  \n  \nOne of the great achievements of our species is our ability to solve societal\ndilemmas. In a way, we solve them by cheating. That is, we don't solve them\nwithin the parameters of the game. Instead, we modify the game to eliminate\nthe dilemma. Recall the two drivers stuck behind a fallen tree that neither\none can move by himself. They're not in a Prisoner's Dilemma. They're not even\nin a Snowdrift Dilemma. In their situation, their selfish interest coincides\nwith the group interest—they're going to move the tree and get on with their\nlives. The trick to solving societal dilemmas is make them look like that.\nThat's what societal pressures do: they're how society puts its thumb on the\nscales.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nSolving societal dilemmas often means considering the people involved and\ntheir situations more broadly. The sealed-bag exchange is no longer a\nPrisoner's Dilemma if we assume the people involved have a sufficiently strong\nconscience.\n\nAlice might be thinking: “If I assume Bob will cooperate, I have two choices.\nIf I cooperate, I'll get my purchase and feel good about cooperating with Bob.\nIf I defect, I'll get my purchase for free but I'll feel guilty about cheating\nBob. That guilty feeling is worse than giving up the money, so it makes sense\nfor me to cooperate. On the other hand, if I assume Bob will cheat me, my two\nchoices look like this: If I cooperate, Bob will take my money and I'll feel\nstupid and angry for cooperating with a cheat. If I defect, I won't get my\npurchase and will feel guilty for trying to cheat Bob. That stupid feeling for\nbeing cheated is a little worse than the guilty feeling for trying to cheat\nBob—who turned out to be a cheat himself. But Bob is making this same\nanalysis, and he doesn't want to feel guilty about cheating me, either. So\nhe's not going to defect.”\n\nAnd indeed, Bob makes the same analysis and also cooperates, although—most\nlikely—they both don't consciously decide anything and both just behave\nhonestly and trust each other to do the same. Maybe I have the emotions\nwrong—they could be motivated by a moral compass, by a sense of fairness, or\nby altruism towards the other person. In any case, dilemma solved.\n\nThose guilty feelings come from inside our heads. Feelings of guilt are a\nsocietal pressure, one that works to varying degrees in each of us.\n\nMoral pressure isn't the only thing we use to solve societal dilemmas. All of\nthe considerations that make cooperation more attractive and defection less\nattractive are societal pressures. These include the rewards society directs\ntowards cooperators and the penalties it directs towards defectors, the legal\npunishments society metes out to defectors, and the security measures that\nmake defecting difficult to pull off and even more difficult to get away\nwith.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos955405)\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Stealing.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Respect property rights. | Competing interest: Get stuff without having to pay for it.  \nGroup norm: Don't steal. | Corresponding defection: Steal.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, society implements these\nsocietal pressures:\n\n> > Moral: People feel good about being honest and bad about stealing. People\n> have been taught religious admonitions like “Thou shalt not steal.”\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Society shuns people who have a reputation for being thieves.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Stealing is illegal, and society punishes thieves.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Door locks, burglar alarms, and so on.  \n  \nOf course, there's a lot more going on, and I'll discuss that in later\nchapters. The real world isn't this simplistic; any analysis of human\ninteraction must take circumstances into account. If Alice is a tourist in a\nforeign country, Bob might cheat her anyway. If the dollar value of cheating\nis high enough, either Alice or Bob might decide that cheating is worth more\nthan the negative feelings that result from cheating. In Chapter 3, I said\nthat trust is contextual; all of that analysis applies here.\n\nFor most of us, it is more worthwhile to cooperate than to defect. It can be a\nbetter strategy for us, given what we know about the people who share in our\ndilemma.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos955853)\nAnd, for different and equally valid reasons, some of us find defection to be\nmore valuable than cooperation. Not universally, not all of the time, but at\nthat moment for that person and that particular trade-off. There are no actual\ndilemmas; there are just individual subjective risk trade-offs.\n\nHere are six different ways societal pressures can reduce the scope of\ndefection—which I'll illustrate using the example of Alice potentially\ncheating a merchant.\n\n  * Pressures that increase the actual or perceived difficulty of defecting. Actual commerce usually doesn't happen inside sealed bags. Bob takes various additional security precautions to minimize the risk that Alice might cheat. Bob requires her to pay with hard-to-forge currency, or runs her credit card through a third-party authentication system. Window bars and burglar alarms make it harder for Alice to steal from Bob.\n\n  * Pressures that raise the consequences of defecting. These would be largely implemented after the fact; think prison terms, fines, cutting off a thief's hand,[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos956690) and social ostracism. Even if they never catch anyone, the police can make it difficult and expensive to commit a crime; every heist movie demonstrates this entertainingly.\n\n  * Pressures that reduce the actual or expected benefits of defecting. Exploding ink cartridges can make stolen garments less useful to thieves, and daily ATM withdrawal limits restrict how much a thief can steal.\n\n  * Pressures that limit the damage caused by the defections that happen. Bob won't keep a lot of cash in his store. He might even store some of his expensive inventory elsewhere. He'll also have an insurance policy that will help him resume normal business quickly after a theft.\n\n  * Pressures that increase the benefits of cooperating. Reputation serves this function; Alice derives value from being known in society as honest and honorable in her business dealings, more so if she is part of the same society as the merchant she patronizes. Certainly Alice's credit rating is a part of her reputation. We also have a powerful [need to conform](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1118114) to the group.\n\n  * Pressures that lower the costs of cooperating. Society makes it easy to cooperate. Stores make check-out stands easy to find. Unforgeable paper money and credit cards make it easy to conduct commerce, as opposed to a barter system, or needing to lug around a sackful of gold and silver. Or think of the iTunes store, which makes it easy to buy music legitimately online.\n\n  * There's a lot of overlap here, and many of these techniques are tightly coupled. When you reduce the benefits of defecting, you almost certainly reduce the frequency of defecting.\n\nFigure 6: Societal Pressure Knobs\n\n![6](images/00009.jpg)\n\nThink back to the Hawk-Dove game, and the knobs society can use to set the\ninitial parameters. The categories in that figure are all individual knobs,\nand societal pressures provide a mechanism for the group to control those\nknobs. In theory, if the knobs are calibrated perfectly, society will get the\nexact scope of defection it's willing to tolerate.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThere are many ways to sort societal pressures. The system I'm using sorts\nthem by origin: moral pressures, reputational pressures, institutional\npressures, and security\nsystems.[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos957070)\nThese are categories you've certainly felt yourself. We feel moral pressure to\ndo the right thing or—at least—to not do the wrong thing. Reputational\npressure is more commonly known as peer pressure, but I mean any incentives to\ncooperate that stem from other people. Institutional pressure is broader and\nmore general: the group using rules to induce cooperation. Security systems\ncomprise a weird hybrid: it's both a separate category, and it enhances the\nother three categories.\n\nThe most important difference among these four categories is the scale at\nwhich they operate.\n\n  * Moral pressure works best in small groups. Yes, our morals can affect our interactions with strangers on the other side of the planet, but in general, they work best with people we know well.\n\n  * Reputational pressure works well in small- and medium-sized groups. If we're not at least somewhat familiar with other people, we're not going to be able to know their reputations. And the better we know them, the more accurately we will know their reputations.\n\n  * Institutional pressure works best in larger-sized groups. It often makes no sense in small groups; you're unlikely to call the police if your kid sister steals your bicycle, for example. It can scale to very large groups—even globally—but with difficulty.\n\n  * Security systems can act as societal pressures at a variety of scales. They can be up close and personal, like a suit of armor. They can be global, like the systems to detect international money laundering. They can be anything in between.\n\nI'm being deliberately vague about group sizes here, but there definitely is a\nscale consideration with societal pressures. And because the increasing scale\nof our society is one of the primary reasons our societal pressure systems are\nfailing, it's important to keep these considerations in mind.\n\nAnother difference between the categories of societal pressure is that they\noperate at distinct times during a security event. Moral pressure can operate\neither before, during, or after an individual defects. Reputational, as well\nas most institutional, pressure operates after the defection, although some\ninstitutional pressure operates during. Security can operate before, during,\nor after.\n\nAny measures that operate during or after the event affect the trade-off\nthrough a feedback loop. Someone who knows of the negative outcome—perhaps\nostracism due to a bad reputation, or a jail sentence—either through direct\nknowledge or through seeing it happen to someone else, might refrain from\ndefecting in order to avoid it. This is deterrence.\n\nAll of this, and more, is illustrated in the complicated block diagram below.\nAlong the bottom axis is the timeline: before, during, and after defection.\nAlong the left are the different categories of societal pressure: moral and\nreputational (considered together), institutional, and security systems. The\ntraits/tendencies box represents the physical and emotional aspects of people\nthat make them more or less likely to defect. Natural defenses are aspects of\ntargets that make them more or less difficult to attack. Neither of these are\nsocietal pressure systems, but I include them for the sake of completeness.\n\nAn example might be useful here. Alice is deciding whether to burglarize a\nhouse. The group interest is for her not to burglarize the house, but she has\nsome competing interest—it doesn't matter what it is—that makes her want to\nburglarize the house. Different pressures affect her risk trade-off in\ndifferent ways.\n\n  * Traits/tendencies. If Alice is afraid of heights, she won't try to break in through a second-story window. If she has a broken leg, she probably won't try to break in at all. These considerations operate before defection, at the point of the risk trade-off, when she's deciding whether or not to burglarize the house. (Note that this is not societal pressure.)\n\n  * Natural defenses operate during the burglary. Maybe the owner of the house is home and might tackle Alice. (Again, note that this is not societal pressure.)\n\n  * Most moral pressures operate at the point of the risk trade-off, or decision: Alice's sense of fairness, sense of right and wrong, and desire to obey the law. Some operate during the actual burglary: feelings of empathy, for example. Some operate after she's committed her crime: guilt, shame, and so on.\n\n  * Reputational pressures, assuming she's caught, operate after she's done burglarizing the house. They stem from the reactions and responses of others.\n\n  * Institutional pressures also operate after she's done burglarizing the house. Think of laws and mechanisms to punish the guilty in this case.\n\n  * Security systems can operate before, during, or after. Preemptive interventions, including incarcerating Alice before she commits the crime or forcing her to take some mood-altering medication that makes her not want to burglarize houses, operate before. Defenses operate during: door locks and window bars make it harder for her to burglarize the house. Detection systems can operate during or after: a burglar alarm calls a response that may or may not come in time. Interventions, like camouflage and authentication systems, operate during as well. Forensic systems operate afterwards, and may identify Alice as the burglar. There's one more type of security system: recovery systems that operate after a burglary can provide a perverse incentive to those aware that the consequences of their misbehavior can be mitigated at no cost to themselves. If Alice knows the house owner can easily recover from a burglary—maybe he has a lot of money, or good insurance—she's more likely to burglarize him.\n\nFigure 7: The Scale of Different Societal Pressures\n\n![7](images/00010.jpg)\n\n[Figure 8:](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_015.html#filepos278224)\nHow Societal Pressures Influence the Risk Trade-Off\n\n![8](images/00011.jpg)\n\nSystems that work during or after the burglary usually have a deterrence\neffect. Alice is less likely to burglarize a house if she knows the police are\ndiligent and jail sentences are severe. Or if she knows there's a homeowner\nwho is skilled at karate, or has a burglar alarm.\n\nThese categories are not meant to be rigid. There are going to be societal\npressures that don't fit neatly into any one category. That's okay; these\ncategories are more meant to be a way of broadly understanding the topic as a\nwhole than a formal taxonomy.\n\nIn the next four chapters, I'll outline each type of societal pressure in\nturn. I'll talk about how they work, and how they fail.\n\nSocietal pressure failures occur when the scope of defection is either too\nhigh or too low: either there are too many burglaries, or we're spending too\nmuch money on security to prevent burglary. This is not the same as individual\nburglaries; if someone's house was burglarized, it's not necessarily a\nsocietal security failure. Remember, we can never get the number of hawks down\nto zero; and sooner or later, further reducing their number becomes\nprohibitively expensive.\n\nIn some ways, societal pressures are like a group's immune system. Like\nantibodies, T cells, and B cells, they defend society as a whole against\ninternal threats without being particularly concerned about harm to individual\nmembers of the group. The protection is not perfect, but having several\ndifferent mechanisms that target different threats in different ways—much as\nan immune system does—makes it stronger.\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nMoral Pressures\n\nLooking back at all the elections I've had the opportunity to vote in, there\nhas never been one whose outcome I affected in any way. My voting has never\neven changed the vote percentages in any perceptible way. If I decided to\nnever vote again, democracy wouldn't notice. It would certainly be in my best\ninterest [not to\nvote](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1118590). Voting\nis a pain. I have to drive to the polling place, stand in line, then drive\nhome.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos959127) I'm a\nbusy guy.\n\nVoting is a societal dilemma. For any single individual, there are no benefits\nto voting. Yes, your vote counts—it just doesn't matter. The rare examples of\nsmall elections decided by one vote don't change the central point: voting\nisn't worth the trouble. But if no one voted, democracy wouldn't work.\n\nStill, [people\nvote](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1118959). It\nmakes sense if 1) the voters see a difference between the two candidates, and\n2) they care at least a little bit about the welfare of their fellow citizens.\nStudies with [actual\nvoters](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1119246) bear\nthis out.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos959464)\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Voting.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: A robust democracy. | Competing interest: Do what you want to do on election day.  \nGroup norm: Vote. | Corresponding defection: Don't bother voting.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, society implements these\nsocietal pressures:\n\n> > Moral: People tend to feel good when they vote and bad when they don't\n> vote, because they care about their welfare and that of their fellow\n> citizens.  \n  \nCaring about the welfare of your fellow citizens is an example of a moral\npressure.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos959913)\nTo further increase voter turnout, society can directly appeal to morals. We\nimpress upon citizens the importance of the issues at stake in the election;\nwe even frame some of the issues in explicitly moral terms. We instill in them\na sense of voting as a civic duty. We evoke their sense of group membership,\nand remind them that their peers are voting. We even scare them, warning that\nif they don't vote, the remaining voters—who probably don't agree with them\npolitically—will decide the election.\n\nMurder is another societal dilemma. There might be times when it is in our\nindividual self-interest to kill someone else, but it's definitely in the\ngroup interest that murder not run rampant. To help prevent this from\nhappening, society has evolved explicit moral prohibitions against murder,\nsuch as the Sixth (or Fifth, in the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditional\nnumber) Commandment, “Thou shalt not kill.”\n\nMorality is a complex concept, and the subject of thousands of years' worth of\nphilosophical and theological debate. Although the word “moral” often refers\nto an individual's values—with “moral” meaning “good,” and “immoral” meaning\n“bad”—I am using the term “morals” here very generally, to mean any innate or\ncultural guidelines that inform people's decision-making processes as they\nevaluate potential trade-\noffs.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos960314) These\nencompass conscious and unconscious processes, explicit rules and gut\nfeelings, deliberate thoughts, and automatic reactions. These also encompass\ninternal reward mechanisms, for both cooperation and defection. Looking back\nat [Figure 8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_014.html#filepos269756)\nin Chapter 6, there is going to be considerable overlap between morals and\nwhat I called “traits/tendencies”—I hope to ignore that as well. As we saw in\nChapter 3, all sorts of physiological processes make us prone to prosocial\nbehaviors like cooperation and altruism. I'm lumping all of these under the\nrubric of morals.\n\nAnd while morals can play a large part in someone's risk trade-off, in this\nchapter I am just focusing on how morals act as a societal pressure system to\nreduce the scope of defection. In Chapter 11, I'll discuss how morals affect\nthe decision to cooperate or defect more broadly.\n\nBeliefs that voting is the right thing to do, and that murdering someone is\nwrong, are examples of moral pressure: a mechanism designed to engage people's\nsense of right and wrong. Natural selection has [modified our\nbrains](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1119673) so\nthat trust, altruism, and cooperation feel good, but—as we well know—that\ndoesn't mean we're always trustworthy, altruistic, and cooperative. In both of\nthe above examples, voting and murder, morals aren't very effective. With\nvoting, a large defection rate isn't too much of a problem. U.S. presidential\nelections are decided by about half the pool of eligible\nvoters.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos960870)\nElections for lesser offices are decided by an even smaller percentage. But\nwhile this is certainly a social issue, the harm non-voters cause is minimal.\n\nWith murder, the number of defectors is both smaller and more harmful. In\n2010, [the murder\nrate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1120015) in the\nU.S. was 5.0 per 100,000 people. [Elsewhere in\nthe](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1120443) world,\nit ranges from 0.39 per 100,000 in the relatively murder-free nation of\nSingapore, to an astonishing 58 per 100,000 in El Salvador.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nMorals affect societal dilemmas in a variety of ways. They can affect us at\nthe time of the risk trade-off, by making us feel good or bad about a\nparticular cooperate/defect decision. They can affect us after we've made the\ndecision and during the actual defection: empathy for our victims, for\nexample. And they can affect us after the defection, through feelings of\nguilt, shame, pride, satisfaction, and so on. Anticipating moral feelings that\nmay arise during and after defection provides either an incentive to cooperate\nor a deterrent from defection.\n\nAt the risk of opening a large philosophical can of worms, I'll venture to say\nthat morals are unique in being the only societal pressure that makes people\n“want to” behave in the group interest. The other three mechanisms make them\n“have to.”\n\nThere are two basic types of morals that affect risk trade-offs, one general\nand the other specific. First, the general. The human evolutionary tendencies\ntoward trust and cooperation discussed in Chapter 3 are reflected in our\nmoral, ethical, and religious codes. These codes vary wildly, but all\nemphasize prosocial behaviors like altruism, fairness, cooperation, and trust.\nThe most general of these is the Golden Rule: “Do unto others what you would\nhave them do unto you.” Different groups have their own unique spin on the\n[Golden\nRule](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1120829), but\nit's basically an admonition to cooperate with others. It really is the\nclosest thing to a universal moral principle our species\nhas.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos961492)\n\nMoral reminders don't have to be anything formal. They can be as informal as\nthe proverbs—which are anything but simplistic—that we use to teach our\nchildren; and cultures everywhere have proverbs about altruism, diligence,\nfidelity, and being a cooperating member of the\ncommunity.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos965983)\nThe models of the world we learn sometimes have moral components, too.\n\nThis can go several ways. You might learn not to defecate upstream of your\nvillage because you've been taught about cholera, or because you've been\ntaught that doing so will make the river god angry. You might be convinced not\nto throw down your weapon and leave your fellow pikemen to face the charge\nalone either by a love for your comrades-at-arms like that for your brothers,\nor by knowledge that pikemen who run from charging horsemen get lanced in the\nback—not to mention what happens to deserters.\n\nTraditionally, religion was the context where society codified and taught its\nmoral rules. The Judeo-Christian tradition has the Ten Commandments, and\nBuddhism the Four Noble Truths. Muslims have the Five Pillars of Islam. All of\nthese faiths call for the indoctrination of children in their teachings.\nReligion even exerts a subtle influence on the non-religious. In one\nexperiment, theists and atheists alike gave more money away—to an anonymous\nstranger, not to charity—when they were first asked to unscramble a jumbled\nsentence containing words [associated with\nreligion](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1121115)\nthan when the sentence contained only religion-neutral words. Another found\nless cheating when they were asked to recall the [Ten\nCommandments](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1121545).\nA third experiment measured cheating behavior as a function of belief in a\ndeity. They found no difference in cheating behavior between believers and\nnon-believers, but found that people who conceived of a loving, caring, and\nforgiving God were much more likely to cheat than those who conceived of a\n[harsh, punitive,\nvengeful](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1121940),\nand punishing\nGod.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos967428)\n\nOften, morals are not so much prescriptions of specific behaviors as they are\nmeta rules. That is, they are more about intention than action, and rarely\ndictate actual behaviors. Is the Golden Rule something jurors should follow?\nShould it dictate how soldiers ought to treat enemy armies? Many ethicists\nhave long argued that the Golden Rule is [pretty much\nuseless](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1122385) for\nfiguring out what to do in any given situation.\n\nOur moral decisions are contextual. Even something as basic as “Thou shalt not\nkill” isn't actually all that basic. What does it mean to kill someone? A more\nmodern translation from the original Hebrew is “Thou shalt not murder,” but\nthat just begs the question. What is the definition of murder? When is killing\nnot murder? Can we kill in self-defense, either during everyday life or in\nwartime? Can we kill as punishment? What about abortion? Is euthanasia moral?\nIs assisted suicide? Can we [kill\nanimals](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1122781)? The\ndevil is in the details. [This is the\nstuff](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1123104) that\nphilosophers and moral theologians grapple with, and for the most part, we can\nleave it to them. For our purposes, it's enough to note that general moral\nreminders are a coarse societal pressure.\n\nContextualities are everywhere. Prosocial behaviors like altruism and fairness\nmay be universal, but they're expressed differently at different times in each\nculture. This is important. While morals are internal, that doesn't mean we\ndevelop them naturally, like the ability to walk or grasp. Morals are taught.\nThey're memes and they do evolve, subject to the rules of natural selection,\nbut they're not genetically determined.\n\nOr maybe some are. There's a theory that we have a [moral\ninstinct](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1123430)\nthat's analogous to our language instinct. Across cultures and throughout\nhistory, all moral codes have rules in common; the Golden Rule is an example.\n[Others\nrelevant](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1123746) to\nthis book include a sense of fairness, a sense of justice, admiration of\ngenerosity, prohibition against murder and general violence, and punishment\nfor wrongs against the community. Psychologist and animal behaviorist Marc\nHauser even goes so far as to propose that humans have [specific brain\nfunctions](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1124037)\nfor morals, similar to our language\ncenters.[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos968564)\nAnd psychologist Jonathan Haidt proposes [five fundamental\nsystems](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1124539) that\nunderlie human morality.\n\n  * Harm/care systems. As discussed in Chapter 3, we are naturally predisposed to care for others. From mirror neurons and empathy to oxytocin, our brains have evolved to exhibit altruism.\n\n  * Fairness/reciprocity systems. Also discussed in Chapter 3, we have natural notions of fairness and reciprocity.\n\n  * In-group/loyalty systems. Humans have a [strong tendency](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1125277) to divide people into two categories, those in our group (“us”) and those not in our group (“them”). This has serious security ramifications, which we'll talk about in the section on group norms later in the chapter, and in the next chapter about group membership.\n\n  * Authority/respect systems. Humans have a tendency to [defer to authority](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1125590) and will follow orders simply because they're told to by an authority.\n\n  * Purity/sanctity systems. This is probably the aspect of morality that has the least to do with security, although patriarchal societies have used it to police all sorts of female behaviors. Mary Douglas's Purity and Danger talks about how notions of [purity and sanctity](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1126348) operate as stand-ins for concepts of unhealthy and dangerous, and this certainly influences morals.\n\nYou can think of these systems as moral receptors, and compare them to taste\nand touch receptors. Haidt claims an evolutionary basis for his categories,\nalthough the evidence is scant. While there may be an innate morality\nassociated with them, they're also strongly influenced by culture. In any\ncase, they're a useful partitioning of our moral system, and they all affect\nrisk trade-offs.\n\nThese five fundamental systems are also influenced by external events.\n[Spontaneous\ncooperation](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1126696)\nis a common response among those affected by a natural disaster or other\ncrisis. For example, there is a marked [increase in\nsolidarity](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1127045)\nduring and immediately after a conflict with another group, and the U.S.\nexhibited that solidarity after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. This included a\ngeneral [increase in\nprosocial](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1127425)\nbehaviors such as spending time with children, engaging in religious\nactivities, and donating money. [Crime in New\nYork](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1127827)\ndropped. There was also an increase in [in-group/out-\ngroup](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1128272)\ndivisions, as evidenced by an [increase in hate\ncrimes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1128759)\nagainst Muslims and other minorities throughout the country.\n\nSome of our moral pressure is very strong. [Kin\naversion](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1129179),\nthe particular disgust we have for the idea of mating with people we grew up\nwith, works without any prompting or ancillary\nsecurity.[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos969041)\nSo does our tendency to feel [protective\nimpulses](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1130196)\ntowards children, which can extend to [small\nanimals](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1131438) and\n[even dolls](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1131883).\nThis makes sense. We avoided incest and looked after our offspring for\nmillions of years before we became human. These strong moral inclinations can\nbe deliberately tapped. Think of evocations of kin relationships to foster\ncooperation: blood brothers, brothers in Christ, and so on. Or how cartoon\nanimals are so often drawn with the big-head-big-eyes look of babies in an\nattempt to make them more universally likeable.\n\nA lot of our morals are cultural. For example, while fairness is a universal\nhuman trait, [notions of\nfairness](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1132455)\ndiffer among groups, based on variables like community size and religious\nparticipation. Psychologist Joseph Henrich used a cooperation game to study\nnotions of fairness, altruism, and trust among the Machiguenga tribesmen deep\nin the Peruvian Amazon. While Westerners tended to share a lucky find with\nsomeone else, the tribesmen were more likely to keep it to themselves. In both\ninstances, the actions were perceived as fair by others of the same\nculture.[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos969608)\n\nThink back to the various societal dilemmas we've discussed so far. Many of\nthem have a moral component that encourages people to cooperate. We're\ntaught—or conditioned, depending on what social science theory you\nbelieve—that stealing and fraud are wrong, although different cultures have\ndifferent definitions of property. We're taught that taking more than our fair\nshare is wrong: whatever “fair” means in our culture. We're taught that\nsitting idly by while others do all the work is wrong, although no one accuses\nthe incapacitated, the infirm, the elderly, or infants of being immoral. Even\ncriminals have moral codes that prohibit ratting on each other.\n\nOf course, the effectiveness of these rules depends largely on individual\ncircumstances, and some of them—such as “honor among thieves,” or the\npoliteness rule against taking the last item on a communal plate of food—are\nnotoriously weak. But there would be even less honor among thieves if the\nphrase didn't exist to remind them of their moral obligation to the group.\n\nMoral pressure can do better, though. In addition to general admonitions to\ncooperative behavior, other measures specifically remind people of their moral\nobligations to the group, such as the obligation to vote. For example, think\nabout the signs in restaurant bathrooms that read, “Employees must wash hands\nbefore returning to\nwork.”[12](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos971117)\nAnother example are the signs that remind people not to litter. My favorite is\n“[Don't mess with\nTexas](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1133052),” one\nof the best advertising slogans ever.\n\nOf course, signs warning “No shoplifting,” or “Shoplifting is a crime,”\nprimarily remind shoplifters that they run the risk of getting caught and\ngoing to jail; more about that in a couple of chapters. These reminders\nnonetheless have an unmistakable moral component. And, more precisely, public\nservice announcements that deliberately invoke people's feelings of guilt and\nshame have been shown to be [effective in\nchanging](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1133427)\nbehavior.\n\nOne afternoon at a historic monument in Rome, I saw a sign advising visitors:\n“This is your history. Please don't graffiti it.” That sign was an artifact of\na societal dilemma: it's fun to carve one's name into the rock wall, but if\neveryone does that, historic monuments will soon look ugly. The difference\nbetween selfish interest and group interest is small in this case; for some\npeople, a simple reminder is enough to tip the scales in favor of the group.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nGroup norms are themselves a form of moral societal pressure. Voting turnout\nrates range from as high as 92% in Austria to as low as 48% in the United\nStates. Yes, some countries make voting mandatory and use other categories of\nsocial pressure to get people to vote, and we'll talk about those in the next\nchapter; but these are rates in countries where voting is entirely optional.\n\nThe “Don't mess with Texas” slogan is so good because it doesn't just remind\npeople not to litter. It reinforces the group identity of Texans both as\npeople who don't leave messes and who are not to be messed with.\n\nWe not only absorb our moral codes and definitions of right and wrong from the\ngroup; the group also transmits cues about cooperation and defection and what\nit means to act in a trustworthy manner. People are more likely to suppress\ntheir self-interest in favor of the group interest if they feel that others\nare doing so as well, and they're less likely to do so if they feel that\nothers are [taking\nadvantage](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1133821) of\nthem. The psychological mechanism for this is unclear, but certainly it is\nrelated to our innate sense of fairness. We generally don't mind sacrificing\nfor the group, as long as we're all sacrificing fairly. But if we feel like\nwe're being taken advantage of by others who are defecting, we're more likely\nto defect as well.\n\nIf you see your neighbor watering his lawn during a drought restriction and\ngetting away with it, your sense of fairness is offended. To restore fairness,\nyou have two options: you can turn him in, or you can take the same benefit\nfor yourself. You have to live with your neighbor, so defecting is easier.\n(Recall the phrase “if you can't beat ‘em, join ‘em.”)\n\nPsychologist [Andrew\nColman](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1134324)\ncalled this the Bad Apple\nEffect.[13](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos971578)\nAny large group is likely to contain a few bad apples who will defect at the\nexpense of the group interest and inspire others to do likewise. If someone is\nspeeding, or littering, or watering his lawn in spite of water-use\nrestrictions, others around him are more likely to do the same.\n\nThis can occasionally create a positive-feedback loop, driven by individual\ndifferences in [how people\nevaluate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1134670)\ntheir risk trade-off. The first defectors provide a small additional incentive\nfor everyone else to defect. Because there are always some people who are\npredisposed to cooperate, but just barely, that incentive may push them over\nto the defecting side. This, in turn, can result in an even greater incentive\nfor everyone else to defect —a cascade that can sometimes lead to mass\ndefection and even a mob mentality.\n\nBoth experiment and observation bear this out. Littering is a societal\ndilemma: it is in everyone's self-interest to drop his or her own trash on the\nground—carrying it to a can is bothersome—but if everyone did that, the\nstreets would be a mess. People are more likely to litter if there is a small\namount of litter already on the ground, and two or three times [more likely to\nlitter](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1135033) if\nthere is a lot. Just seeing a single person litter, or [seeing\nsomeone](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1135954) pick\nup litter, modifies behavior. In a recent book, James B. Stewart points to the\ncurrent epidemic of lying by public figures, and blames it for the [general\nbreakdown](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1136656) of\nethics in America: when lying is believed to be normal, more people lie. In\npsychological experiments, a single [unpunished free\nrider](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1137020) in a\ngroup can cause the entire group to spiral towards less and less cooperation.\nThese patterns reflect the human tendency to adhere not only to social norms,\nbut to moral norms. [In\nIslam](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1137652),\nannouncing that you've sinned is itself a\nsin.[14](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos972309)\n\nThis effect can motivate cooperation, too. For years, society has tried to\nencourage people to conserve energy. It's another societal dilemma: we're\nbetter off collectively if we conserve our natural resources, but each of us\nindividually is better off if we use as much as we want. Even more selfishly,\nif I use as much as I want and everyone else conserves, I get all the benefits\nof conservation without actually having to do anything. Awareness campaigns\nhave worked somewhat to mitigate this problem, but not enough.\n\nEvery month, included in my electric bill, is a chart comparing my electricity\nusage to my neighbors' average usage. It tells me if I'm using more, or less,\nelectricity than average. On the face of it, why should I care? Electricity\nisn't free. The more I use, the more I pay. And aside from the savings from\nlower bills—which exist even without the chart—I get no personal benefit for\nconserving, and incur no penalty for not conserving.\n\nBut the chart works. People use less energy when they can compare their energy\nusage with that of their\nneighbors.[15](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos974895)\nThat's because there actually is a benefit and a penalty, albeit entirely\ninside the heads of those receiving the bill: their competitive nature, their\ndesire to conform to group norms, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, people are more likely to pay their taxes if they think others are\npaying their taxes as well. People are more likely to vote, less likely to\noverfish, more likely to get immunized, and less likely to defraud their\ncustomers if they think these practices are the group norm. This isn't peer\npressure; in these cases, the risk trade-off is made in secret. Of course,\nthis sort of thing works even better when the group knows whether or not\nyou've cooperated or defected, but that's the subject of the next chapter.\n\nMorals can be influenced by a powerful ruler, or a ruling class, or a priestly\nclass. Especially if you can manipulate people's in-group/out-group\ndesignations, some awful things can be done in the name of morality: slavery\nand genocide are two\nexamples.[16](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos975868)\nInterestingly, genocide is often precipitated by [propaganda\ncampaigns](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1137893)\nthat paint the victims as vermin or otherwise less than human: undeserving of\nthe moral predispositions people have towards other people.\n\nPsychologist Simon Baron-Cohen maintains that in psychopaths, cruelty and evil\nstem from a [failure or\nabsence](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1138247) of\nempathy. Extending this notion into our model, a person is more inclined to\ncooperate if he feels empathy with the other people in the group, and is more\ninclined to defect if he doesn't feel that empathy. Both general moral rules\nand specific moral reminders serve to enhance empathy to the group, by\nreminding people of both their moral principles and the group\ninterest.[17](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos976483)\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nFor more than ten years, economist Paul Feldman brought bagels into his\nworkplace and sold them on the honor system. He posted prices that people were\nexpected to pay, securing the system by nothing more than the bagel-eaters'\nmorals.[18](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos976922)\nAlthough it was easy to take a bagel without paying, Feldman succeeded in\ncollecting about 90% of the posted price, resulting in much more profit than\nif he had to pay someone to sell the bagels and guard the money. He eventually\nturned this into a full-time business, selling [food on the\nhonor](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1138700) system\nto 140 companies in the Washington, DC, area.\n\nSocietal pressure based on morals largely succeeds because of who we are as\nhuman beings. When we meet someone for the first time, we tend to cooperate.\nWe act trustworthy because we know it's right, and we similarly extend some\namount of trust. We tip in restaurants. We pay for our bagels. We [follow\nsocial norms](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1139099)\nsimply because they are social norms. This is all contextual, of course, and\nwe're not stupid about it. But it is our nature.\n\nPhilosopher [Emmanuel\nLevinas](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1139805) said\nthat morality is grounded in face-to-face interactions. In general, moral\npressure works best at close range. It works best with family, friends, and\nother intimate groups: people whose intentions we can trust. It works well\nwhen the groups are close in both space and time. It works well when it's\nimmediate: in crises and other times of stress. It works well with groups\nwhose members are like each other, whether ethnically, in sharing an interest,\nor some other trait. Even having a common enemy works in this regard.\n\nThink about the chart that shows my energy use compared to my neighbors'. It\ndoesn't compare me to the rest of the world, or even to my country. It\ncompares me to my neighbors, the people most like me.\n\nMorals sometimes work at long range. After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in\nJapan, [people turned\nin](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1140132) thousands\nof wallets and safes found in the rubble, filled with $78 million in cash.\nPeople regularly protest working conditions at factories, or give to relief\nefforts, or fight social injustices, in other countries halfway across the\nplanet. People have moral beliefs that encompass all of humanity, or all\nanimals, or all living creatures. We are a species that is capable of profound\nmorality.\n\nWe are also a species capable of profound immorality. And while moral pressure\nworks, it also regularly fails. When it does, it fails for several specific\nreasons:\n\nPeople vary in their individual behavior. Sure, most people will cooperate\nmost of the time, but some people will defect some of the time, and almost\neveryone will defect once in a while.\n\nMorals often conflict. We'll talk about this more in Chapter 11. Sometimes\ndefectors are people whose morals lead to different imperatives than those\nreached by the cooperators. These people will be largely unaffected by\nsocietal moral pressure. Society will have an easier time convincing a\npotential thief that stealing is wrong than it will have convincing an\nabolitionist that slavery is good.\n\nMorals often overreach. It's relatively easy to use morals to enforce basic\nprosocial behaviors, because those are aligned with what's already in our\nbrains. Enforcing arbitrary moral codes is much harder. If the group norm goes\nagainst any of Haidt's five fundamental moral systems, more people will have\nconflicting morals, and more will defect.\n\nThroughout history, totalitarian regimes have attempted to impose moral codes\non their citizens, suppressing some heretofore acceptable behaviors and\ninventing new obligations. Perhaps the most well-known modern example of an\nauthoritarian attempt to reorient popular moral sensibilities was the Soviet\nUnion's unsuccessful prohibition on the [practice of\nreligion](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1140487),\nwhich threatened to undermine materialist Communist ideology. This kind of\nthing isn't rare. When I visited Myanmar in 1991, I saw large billboards\neverywhere, courtesy of the government's “People's Desire Campaign,” exhorting\nthe populace to believe and act in all sorts of pro-government ways. These\ncampaigns often just drive the behaviors underground.\n\nMorals can be manipulated. [Confidence\ntricksters](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1140989),\nin particular, manipulate the very same traits that make us cooperate:\nkindness, altruism, fairness.\n\nMorals scale badly. They fail as societies become larger and the moral ties\nthat bind their members weaken.\n\nRemember Baron-Cohen's theory of empathy. As the group gets larger and more\nanonymous, there's less empathy. Joseph Stalin said, “the death of one man is\na tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic”; similarly, [we have\ntrouble](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1141390)\nthinking about large groups in the same moral way we think of the people\nclosest to us.\n\nAll of these reasons make morals the weakest of the societal pressures. Morals\nare the societal pressure that works “when no one is watching.” They determine\nwhether we keep a wallet that no one saw us find and pick up, whether we\nlitter on a deserted street, whether we conserve energy or crank up the air\nconditioning, and whether we help ourselves to a bagel on a tray in an empty\nbreak room.\n\nWhen nothing other than moral pressure influences a societal dilemma, the\nnumber of defectors will be at its largest. However, opportunities for\nindividuals to make moral choices when they are unobserved represent only a\nsmall portion of societal dilemmas. We humans are a social species, and more\noften than not someone is watching. And that makes an enormous difference.\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nReputational Pressures\n\nFrom the perspective of trust, societal dilemmas involve a Red Queen Effect.\nOn one hand, defectors should evolve to be better able to fool cooperators.\nAnd on the other, cooperators should evolve to better recognize defectors.\nIt's a race between the [ability to\ndeceive](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1141814) and\nthe ability to detect deception.\n\nThere's a lot of research on detecting deception, and humans seem not to be\nvery good at it. There are exceptions, and people can learn to be better at\nit—but in general, we can't tell liars from truth-tellers. Like the Lake\nWobegon children who are all above average, most of us think we're much better\nat detecting deception than we actually are. We're better, but still not\ngreat, at predicting cooperators and\ndefectors.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos979072)\n\nThis is surprising. The Red Queen Effect means both sides improve in order to\nstay in place, yet in this case, defectors have the upper hand. A possible\nreason is that we have developed another method for figuring out who to trust\nand who not to. We're a social species, and in our evolutionary past we\ninteracted with the same people over and over again. We don't have to be that\ngood at predicting bad behavior, because we're really good at detecting it\nafter the fact—and using reputation to punish\nit.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos980312)\n\nIn fact, our brains have specially evolved to deal with cheating after the\nfact. Perhaps the most vivid demonstration of this can be seen with the [Wason\nSelection\nTask](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1142175). The\ntest compares people's ability to solve a generic logical reasoning problem\nwith their ability to solve the same problem presented in a framework of\ndetecting cheaters: for example, “if Alice went to Boston, she took the train”\nversus “if Alice is served alcohol, she is over 21.” People are generally much\n[better at\nsolving](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1142707) the\nlatter. Additionally, fMRI [scans of the\nbrains](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1143121)\nperforming this task show that we have specific brain circuitry for cheater\ndetection.\n\nThink back to how contrived and artificial the sealed bag exchange from\nChapter 5 seemed. That's because there's more going on than short-term\ndecision making. Commerce isn't a one-time event. It happens again and again,\nday after day, often between the same people. We know the individuals and\ncompanies with whom we interact, maybe personally, maybe casually, maybe by\ntheir brand. Everyone has a reputation, and it's important. While morals are\npart of the reason we cooperate with each other, the preponderance of the\nevidence—both observational and experimental—supports the hypothesis that [we\ncooperate\nprimarily](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1143615)\nbecause we crave reward (engagement) and fear punishment (exclusion) from\nother members of our\ngroup.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos980891)\n\nBob depends on his reputation as an honest merchant. If he cheats Alice, she\nwon't do business with him again. Even worse, she'll tell her\nfriends.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos983161)\nBob couldn't survive as a merchant if he had a reputation as a cheater. If we\nassume that the cost to Bob's reputation if he defects is greater than the\nvalue of the item being purchased, he has no dilemma. He is better off\ncooperating, regardless of what Alice does. Reputation is such a major factor\nfor Bob that he almost certainly allows Alice to reverse the transaction after\nthe fact, a process commonly known as returning the\npurchase.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos983862)\nThis is the fundamental threat of damage to your reputation. A business works\nto make its customers happy, because it knows its reputation will be damaged\nif it doesn't deliver. Customers, knowing this is true, are more willing to\ntrust the\nbusiness.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos984377)\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Cheating customers.  \n---  \nSociety: Group of merchants/society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Merchants are trusted. | Competing interest: Maximize short-term profits.  \nGroup norm: Don't cheat customers. | Corresponding defection: Cheat customers when possible.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, society implements these\nsocietal pressures:\n\n> > Moral: Guilt, shame, sense of fairness, kindness, etc.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Merchants want to be seen as trustworthy. Customers share\ntheir experiences with merchants, making merchants less likely to cheat\ncustomers so as to retain their good reputation.  \n  \nCustomer reputation used to be a bigger deal than it is today. When commerce\nwas transacted entirely in local markets with local merchants, in situations\nwhere buyers and sellers knew each other and knew they would need to do\nbusiness with each other many times in the future, reputation mattered just as\nmuch to the customer as it did to the merchant. In today's world of global\ncommerce, where potential customers may be located a half a world away,\ncustomer reputation matters much less than merchant reputation. Means for\nascertaining the integrity of potential customers are coming back, though.\nOnline reputation systems, like eBay's feedback mechanism, gave both merchants\nand customers [reputation\ninformation](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1144337)\nabout each other. (In 2008, [eBay changed\nthis](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1145353), and no\nlonger allows merchants to give feedback on customers, citing abuse of the\nprocess by merchants.)\n\nWe take our reputations very seriously, and spend a lot of time and effort\nmaintaining them, sometimes defending them to the point of\ndeath.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos984827) We\ngo to these extremes because we recognize that if we want others to trust us\nand cooperate with us, we need a good reputation. So we keep our reputation\nclean, cover up blemishes, or fake our reputation completely.\n\nTellingly, psychological and brain research both show that we [remember\nnegative](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1145811)\ninformation about people more vividly, with more detail, and for a longer time\nthan positive information. It seems that knowing who will defect is more\nimportant than knowing whom to trust.\n\nWe're also good at keeping up with the reputation of others. There's a [theory\nthat gossip](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1146947)\noriginated as a mechanism for learning about the reputations of others and\nhelping us know whom to trust. Of course, gossip requires language. Humans are\nunique on the planet for our ability to\ngossip,[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos985349) and\nhumans everywhere on the planet are enthusiastic about it. It tells us who is\nlikely to be cooperative and who is not, so we know [whom to\ninteract](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1148031)\nwith. It helps [establish group\ninterests](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1148692)\nand group norms. It works as a societal pressure system, too; both\nobservational studies and experiments show that [gossip helps\nkeep](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1149239) people\nin line. Social networking sites are the most modern manifestations of these\nancient needs.\n\nReputation is a common mechanism for raising the costs of defecting and\nincreasing the benefits of cooperating. Buskers generally don't disrupt each\nother's acts because they don't want a bad reputation among their peers.\n[Diamond\nmerchants](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1150077)\ngenerally pay their debts promptly, don't pocket other people's diamonds, and\ndon't substitute worthless stones for valuable ones, because they don't want\nto jeopardize their reputation within the community. And prisoners sometimes\nwon't testify against each other because they don't want to be known as stool\npigeons by the other criminals in town.\n\nHere's how finely tuned we are to others watching our actions. The coffee room\nat the Division of Psychology at the University of Newcastle in Australia\nworks on the honor system, just like Feldman's bagel business. Researchers\nfound that if they put a sign above the pay box with a picture of [a pair of\neyes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1150516)—not an\nentire face, just a pair of eyes—people put almost three times as much money\nin the box as they did when the sign had an image of flowers. Similarly,\nchildren who were told to take only one piece of Halloween candy but were left\nalone with a full bowl defected less when the bowl was placed in front of a\nmirror. And they defected even less when they were asked their [names and\naddresses](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1150918)\nbefore being given the same opportunity. Along the same lines, religion often\nprovides a universal observer. God is omniscient and the arbiter of one's\nfinal reputation, and a calculating believer behaves\naccordingly.[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos985807)\n\nNot only do we guard our reputation against blemishes, we also take pains to\nadvertise our good reputation. This can be as grandiose as a company touting\nits customer satisfaction ratings or product quality awards, or as mundane as\nthose small “I Voted” stickers that many polling places in the United States\ngive to voters to wear for the rest of Election Day. The effect is both\nreputational and moral; voters can publicly demonstrate that they behaved in\nthe group interest and voted, and simultaneously remind others of their civic\nresponsibility. There's even a German expression, “Tu Gutes und rede darüber”:\n“Do good and talk about\nit.”[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos986414)\n\nWe need several more pieces to make a reputational pressure system work. We\ndon't always have perfect information about what other people are doing. Maybe\nthey cooperated when we thought they defected, or vice versa. Or they might\nhave done the wrong thing accidentally or because they weren't thinking\nclearly. Our reputational systems have to work despite the occasional mistake.\nThis requires two things: contrition and forgiveness . If you defect by\naccident, apologize, make amends, and then return to cooperating. And if\nsomeone does that to you, forgive and return to cooperating.\n\nI'm glossing over a lot of subtleties here. Forgiveness is a complicated\nemotion, and there's a fine line between being forgiving and being a sucker,\nand between being contrite and being a doormat. [There's a great\nword](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1151369) from\nthe Tshiluba language, spoken in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo,\nthat regularly appears on impossible-to-translate word lists. Ilunga means\nsomeone who forgives any abuse the first time it occurs, tolerates it the\nsecond time, and neither forgives nor tolerates it the third time. The English\nsaying is snappier: “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.”\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThroughout most of history, commerce was a local phenomenon. Reputation made\nit work, and reputation was local. The emergence of long-distance commerce in\nthe Western world was aided in great part by the involvement of European\nQuakers, who earned a reputation for dealing honorably with their business\npartners. Prior to the mid-17th century, European traders ran a significant\nrisk that trading partners from other countries would act in their own self-\ninterest and renege on promises they had made; overseas contracts were often\nunenforceable, so the potential for profit often outweighed the likelihood of\npunishment. However, the Quakers' religious commitment to integrity and simple\nliving, and their belief in the essential worth of every individual, informed\nall of their business dealings. Being upright with God was more important to\nthem than making a fast buck. The moral benefit they experienced from acting\nin accord with their consciences, and the ensuing reputational benefits within\nboth their religious and business communities, outweighed any short-term\nfinancial gains that might have come from shady dealing. A Quaker found to\nhave dealt with others dishonestly ran the risk not only of losing business\nopportunities, but of being expelled from his religious community. As a\nresult, [Quakers would\ncooperate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1151713)\neven if it went against their self-interest, and—as they consolidated their\npositions in industry—there was a gradual increase of trust in them among\noverseas traders.\n\nThe Quakers were an exception. The problem with reputation is that it doesn't\nnaturally scale well. Recall Dunbar's numbers. We can recognize 1,500 faces,\nbut the number of people we know enough about to know their reputation is much\nlower—maybe 500 or even 150. Once our societies get larger than that, we need\nother mechanisms by which to infer reputation than direct knowledge of the\nother person. And, as you'd expect, we have developed several of these.\n\nOne of the ways to scale reputation is to generalize based on group\nmembership. So we might believe that people with a particular skin color, or\nwho speak a particular language, or who worship a particular God, are\nuntrustworthy. We might believe that a Quaker is trustworthy.\n\nDuring the mid-17th century, being a Quaker meant something to the general\ncommunity. In different periods of history, so did being a Freemason, or a\nmember of the Medici family. In the 12th century, you could take a Templar\nletter of credit issued in England all the way to Jerusalem. In the 11th\ncentury, the [Maghribi\ntraders](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1152260) of\nthe medieval Mediterranean had a reputation similar to the Quakers. A thousand\nyears earlier, Roman letters of introduction were similarly trusted throughout\nthe empire.\n\nPolitical scientist [Robert\nPutnam](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1152687) has\nargued that mistrust increases in a community as ethnic diversity increases.\nEvidence of this effect comes from sources as diverse as studies of\ncarpooling, Peruvian micro-credit cooperatives, and Civil War deserters. Even\nworse, this inherent mistrust of those in other ethnic groups isn't offset by\nan increase in trust of those in one's own ethnic group; trust across the\nboard weakens in more ethnically diverse\ncommunities.[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos986906)\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that we have an enormous number of membership\nmarkers that we use to determine who is like us: language, dress, ethnicity,\ngang tags, haircuts, tattoos, jewelry, T-shirt slogans, food choices,\ngestures, secret handshakes, turns of phrase in speech, formal membership\ncredentials, and so on. We generalize based on profession, city of residence,\npolitical affiliation, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, interests,\nand pretty much any other category you can think of. The theory is that all of\nthese are [vestigial\nremnants](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1153228) of\nprehistoric kin recognition mechanisms. But while these might have worked\nbetter in our evolutionary past than they do today, our brains are still stuck\non them.\n\nTake appearance, for example. Numerous experiments indicate that we are more\nlikely to trust [people who look\nlike](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1153664) us. The\nphenomenon goes well beyond race; experimenters have digitally manipulated\nimages of faces to more or less resemble those of their subjects and found\nthat a variety of prosocial behaviors are correlated with facial similarity.\n\nDialect is a particularly interesting marker of group membership. With the\nnationalization and globalization of mass media, both accents and dialects are\nfading, but for most of human history, they were\nlocalized.[12](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos987563)\nThey're hard to fake, unless you're a rare gifted mimic, and they're generally\nset by adolescence. There is a lot of evidence, worldwide, that people are\npredisposed to cooperate with someone who speaks the same dialect they do. For\ninstance, in one experiment, subjects were more likely to trust people with\nthe [same\naccent](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1154906) they\nhad.[13](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos988130) And\nwe naturally [change our\npatterns](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1155336) of\nspeech and body language to mimic those around us, unconsciously trying to fit\ninto the\ngroup.[14](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos989293) Of\ncourse, the flip side of this is that we're less likely to trust people who\n[don't sound\nlike](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1156218) we do.\nAgain, dialect preference seems to be a vestigial kin-recognition system.\n\nIt's worth noting that membership markers are harder to acquire and fake for\ngroups that involve long-term—even inter-generational—cooperation and trust,\nthan they are for groups involving more near-term cooperation and trust. It's\nmuch easier to learn the knowledge and skills to be a member of the community\nof football fans, or stamp collectors, or a particular church, than it is to\nacquire a new facial feature like an epicanthic fold or a dialect.\n\nGauging reputation by group membership is a lousy way to prejudge\nsomeone—another name for the practice is “stereotyping.” But it's not an\nunreasonable cognitive shortcut, given our inability to interact meaningfully\nwith more than 150 people, or even to put names to more than 1,500 faces.\nHistorically, as the number of people we interacted with grew, we had to\ndevelop these shortcuts. Identifying someone as a member of a particular\ncommunity, whether an ethnic community or a community of choice such as a\nprofessional association, gives us some indication about whether she is likely\nto cooperate with us or defect. If she's a member of the same community as us,\nwe know she's likely to share the same set of ethical rules we do.\n\nRecall the Golden Rule. It's not enough to want to cooperate. You also need to\nknow [how to\ncooperate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1156831)\naccording to your society's particular definition, so others can know you're\nreliably cooperative. One popular business-success book tried to “improve” on\nthe Golden Rule, creating what it called the [Platinum\nRule](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1157198): do\nunto others as they would want you to do unto them. That sounds even more\naltruistic, but it's not what has been encoded in our brains. Figuring out\nwhat someone else wants is easy to get wrong. It's much easier to assume that\nanother person wants what you want. Of course, that works best if you only\ndeal with people who are like you, and are likely to want the same things you\nwant.\n\nSocial norms tell us how to cooperate. This is one of the reasons societies\nhave tended to be homogeneous in their morals: it's advantageous. When people\nwith different morals interact, they may have different default assumptions\nabout what it means to cooperate. Remember the Machiguenga tribesmen in\nChapter 7? They use a different definition of “fair” than Westerners do.\nCooperation works better if we all agree on what it means to\ncooperate.[15](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos989713)\n\nOf course, just because our brains are hard-wired for this sort of in-\ngroup/out-group division doesn't mean it's the right thing to\ndo.[16](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos991118) There\nare all sorts of reasons why stereotyping is a bad system for judging\nindividual people, and for those reasons we should strive to get beyond our\nmore base instincts.\n\nA substitute that can help [reputation\nscale](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1157602) is\ncommitment. By committing ourselves to an action in a way that we cannot undo,\nwe can make up for a lack of reputation. Consider the coordination problem\nbetween a prostitute and a prospective client. The two have met in a bar and\nhave agreed to meet upstairs in his hotel room later in exchange for $100. She\nwants him to pay her in advance, because she doesn't trust that he will pay\nher in his hotel room as promised. Similarly, he is concerned that, once\nhaving received the money, she won't follow through and meet him later. If the\ntwo could trust each other, this would be easy to solve. But they don't.\n\nOne solution is to tear the $100 bill in half, one piece for each of them. In\nthe U.S. at least, half a $100 bill has no value, so neither party has the\nmoney. Now both parties have effectively committed to the rendezvous: so she\ncan receive the other half of the $100 bill and he can receive the service. If\neither one of them defects and misses the meeting, neither gets the\nmoney.[17](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos991447)\neBay escrow services serve the same function; they facilitate trust by forcing\nthe buyer and seller into a commitment they can't get out of easily.\n\nA similar mechanism is to deliberately cut off your escape routes, so you have\nno choice but to follow through on your commitment. This could mean literally\nburning your bridges behind you. In 1519, when Hernán Cortés invaded what\ntoday is Veracruz, Mexico, he scuttled the ships he arrived on, signaling to\nboth the Aztecs waiting for him and his own men that there would be no\nreneging on his commitment.\n\nA second way to demonstrate commitment is to move in steps. When I hired a\ncontractor to perform renovation work on my home, the contract stipulated\nseveral partial payments at different milestones during the project. This\nstep-by-step approach—me paying the contractor partially, him doing some of\nthe work, me paying some more, him doing some more work, etc.—helped both of\nus trust each other during the entire project because the severity of\ndefection was lessened.\n\nThis was also the general idea behind the Cold War doctrine of mutually\nassured destruction. Both the U.S. and the USSR worked to convince the other\nthat they were committed to massive retaliation in the event of a first\nstrike. The result was that neither side was willing to use nuclear weapons;\nthe two countries might not have trusted each other in general, but they both\ntrusted that the other side was crazy enough to follow through on its\ncommitment.\n\nA third way to signal commitment is ritual. This could be a handshake to seal\na commercial deal, a ceremony to seal a marriage, or an Eagle Scout induction\nceremony. Rituals work because 1) reputation is at stake, and 2) society\nprovides sanctions against anyone who reneges. Of course, these only work if\neveryone understands what the ritual is and what it means.\n\nZahavi's handicap signals from Chapter 3 are another way to scale reputation:\ncostly and hard-to-fake demonstrations of our reputation. These include\npublicly attending religious services to demonstrate our\nmorality,[18](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos991915)\nostentatiously spending money to demonstrate our social class, and engaging in\nparticular activities to demonstrate our political or cultural\nproclivities.[19](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos992352)\nNobilities have complex displays of etiquette. Banks spend some of their money\non imposing buildings to show off their financial health. [Criminals have\nsignals](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1157979),\ntoo, to advertise their “good” reputation as a career criminal: prison time\n(that fellow criminals vouch for), tattoos, and deliberate physical self-harm.\n\nBranding is yet another way to make reputation scale, similar to group\nmembership. In many cases, we interact with organizations as groups rather\nthan as individuals. That is, the corporate reputation of McDonald's is more\nimportant to our decision about whether or not to trust it than the individual\nreputation of any of the stores or the individual employees.\n\nBranding isn't necessarily about quality; it's about sameness. Chain\nrestaurants don't necessarily promise the best food, they promise consistency\nin all of their restaurants. So when you sit down at a McDonald's or a\nCheesecake Factory, you know what you're going to get and how much you're\ngoing to pay for it. Their reputation reduces uncertainty.\n\nAdvertising can be about persuading consumers to associate a certain brand\nwith a certain reputation. [Shared brand\nnames](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1158313) serve\nas means of aggregating individual reputations into an overarching group\nreputation, which—if it's maintained in good standing—benefits all members of\nthe coalition. Companies call attention to their age, their size, and the\nquality of their products and services, all in an effort to enhance their\nreputation. Witness the ubiquity of advertising boasting about firms'\npositions on environmental and workplace issues or contributions to worthy\ncauses. Or the effort the principals of the [Saudi Binladin\nGroup](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1158732)\nconstruction company have spent trying to differentiate themselves from their\nterrorist relative.\n\nIn ascertaining quality, consumers will often rely on the cognitive shortcut\nprovided by a brand name, and will even [pay a\npremium](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1159071) for\nproducts with brand names they associate with a reputation for quality. One\nstudy of Bordeaux wines found that customers will pay a premium for bottles\nfrom a [more reputable\nproducer](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1159512),\neven if the wine is no better. Notions of branding have leaked into individual\nreputation as well. Career counselors now advise professionals to “[cultivate\ntheir\nbrand](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1160107).”\n\nA final way to make reputation scale is to systemize it, so that instead of\nhaving to trust a person or company, we can trust the system. A professional\npolice force and judiciary means that you don't have to trust individual\npolicemen, you can trust the criminal justice system. A credit bureau means\nthat lenders don't have to decide whether or not to trust individual\nborrowers, they can trust the credit rating system. A credit card relieves\nmerchants from having to figure out whether a particular customer is able to\npay later; the system does that work for them. Dunbar's number tells us there\nis a limit to the number of individuals we can know well enough to decide\nwhether or not to trust; a single trust decision about a system can serve as a\nproxy for millions of individual trust decisions.\n\nWe have a lot of experience with this kind of thing online: ratings of sellers\non eBay, reviews of restaurants on sites like Yelp, reviews of contractors on\nsites like Angie's List, reviews of doctors, accountants, travel\nagencies…pretty much everything you can think of. Social networking sites\nsystemize reputation, showing us whom we might want to trust because we have\nfriends in common.\n\nThis is an enormous development in societal pressure, one that has allowed\nsociety to scale globally. It used to be that companies could ignore the\ncomplaints of a smallish portion of their customers, because their advertising\noutweighed the word-of-mouth reputational harm. But on the Internet, this\nisn't necessarily true. [A small\ncomplaint](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1160466)\nthat goes viral can have an enormous effect on a company's reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, while these reputational systems have been an enormous\nsuccess, they have brought with them a new type of trust failure. Because\npotential defectors can now attack the reputational systems, they have to be\nsecured. We'll talk about this in Chapter 10.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nReputation [isn't an\neffective](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1160810)\nsocietal pressure system unless it has consequences, and we both reward\ncooperators and punish defectors.\n\nWe reward cooperators all the time incidentally through our actions. We choose\nto do business with merchants who have proven to be trustworthy. We spend time\nwith people who have demonstrated that they're trustworthy. We try to hire\nemployees who have good reputations, and we promote and give bonuses to\nemployees who cooperate. From a security perspective, friendships are mutual\nreward systems for cooperating.\n\nThe common thread in all of these rewards is participation. Humans are a\nsocial species, and we reward by allowing others to participate in the group:\nwhatever it is doing, whatever benefits it is accruing, whatever status and\ncredibility it has achieved. Our brains are hard-wired to need to participate;\nwe crave the approval of the group.\n\nWe also punish defectors. And if participation is the canonical reward,\nexclusion is the corresponding punishment. In our evolutionary past, the most\nsevere punishment was banishment from the group. As interdependent as humans\nwere, this punishment was tantamount to death.\n\nWe still banish people today. We tell them we're no longer their friends and\nthat they shouldn't come around anymore. We cut all ties with certain\nrelatives, kick trolls out of online communities, and unfriend people on\nFacebook. On a different scale, someone with a destroyed credit rating is\npretty much banished from the lending community.\n\nOther punishments are less severe: physical violence, property damage, and so\non. Sometimes we call this sort of thing “revenge.” Here's how [Maine\nlobstermen](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1161230)\ndeal with one of their group violating traditional territories:\n\n> Ordinarily, repeated violation of territorial boundaries will lead to\n> destruction of the offender's gear.

We may still hang around with some\nfriends, but not rely on them as much or not tell them our intimate secrets.\nWe may still invite those relatives to the family's holiday party, but not\ntalk to them much.\n\n[Shame is a\ncommon](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1161581)\nreputational punishment, and—as a result—an important social emotion. Much of\nthis is the informal kind of shaming we've all experienced amongst our friends\nand colleagues. More formal examples include police blotter reports, IRS\nquarterly listings of Americans who renounce their citizenship, public\ndisclosure of [excessive CEO\npay](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1161939),\ntelevised arrests, deadbeat dads in the media, and TV shows like America's\nMost Wanted. Of course, these all have a technological component, and some\nmight be more properly put into the category of institutional pressure.\n\nInformal punishments are so common we can miss them if we're not paying\nattention. An employee who has frequent conflicts with his colleagues may find\nhimself shuffled into a dead-end position, or assigned the graveyard shift. A\nhusband spied flirting with the housekeeper may be told by his friends and\nfamily that such behavior is unacceptable. An entertainer who espouses\nunpopular political positions may encounter a dip in his popularity at the box\noffice as moviegoers boycott his films.\n\n[Informal\npunishments](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1162300)\nare common in our society. They're certainly prevalent through childhood, from\nearly play amongst small children through social ostracism in school. Some\ngroups define themselves through the exclusion of others.\n\nRemember the Bad Apple Effect from the previous chapter? As you might expect,\nthe effects of those [bad apples\ndiminishes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1162697)\nif punishment is threatened.\n\nThere is an old idea that punishment can be transferred from one person to\nanother. In many traditions, God punishes a person's relatives in addition to\npunishing the\ntransgressor.[21](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos993573)\nIn some societies, [if Alice kills\nBob](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1163641), one of\nBob's relatives is allowed to kill one of Alice's relatives in retribution.\nThe [Nazis instituted\nthis](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1164125) as\ngovernment policy; it was called “sippenhaft.” This practice is a form of\nsocietal pressure. If Alice is considering defecting from some group\nnorm—killing another person, committing adultery, whatever—she not only has to\nworry about human or divine retribution against her personally, but also\nretribution against members of her family. And threatening Alice's family\nshould she defect both raises her perceived cost of defection and enlists her\nfamily members in persuading her not to defect in the first place. The Israeli\ngovernment's current practice of bulldozing the homes of suicide bombers'\nfamilies is an example. Of course, sometimes this goes very badly. Think of\n“honor killings” of rape victims, or blood feuds in [various\ncultures](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1164566)\nthroughout history, like the [Hatfields versus the\nMcCoys](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1165365).\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThere's a variant of the Hawk-Dove game that demonstrates how [reputation can\nsolve](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1165678) a\nsocietal dilemma. It's designed so doves are more likely to interact with\ndoves. When this happens, hawks can be isolated and their numbers reduced.\n\nCompared with the basic Hawk-Dove game, cooperation turns out to be an even\nbetter strategy. Stable populations have even fewer hawks because doves, by\npreferring to interact with other doves, can effectively isolate them. Left to\nfight amongst themselves, hawks tend to kill each other off. Returning to\nhuman society, we are at our most cooperative when we seek out other\ncooperative people and avoid those who would take advantage of us. We learned\nthis in Chapter 3 when we looked at the evolution of cooperation: cooperators\ndo better when they can recognize each other. Reputation not only encourages\ncooperation, but also marginalizes defectors to the point where there ends up\nbeing fewer of them to deal with.\n\nThis is important. We've been talking about societal dilemmas as if they're\nalways decisions to either cooperate or defect. In the real world, we often\nhave a choice of people with whom to interact. We don't walk into stores\nrandomly, wondering if the merchant will cheat us. We only walk into stores\nwhere we believe the merchant will not cheat us. Instead of defecting and\ncheating the merchant as punishment, we prefer to shop elsewhere.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nIn Chapter 3, we learned that two things are required for cooperation:\nreciprocal altruism and a calculating intelligence. Morals and reputation, the\ntwo things I've been calling our primitive toolbox of social pressures,\nprovide that reciprocal altruism. Even so, reputational societal pressure can\nfail in many ways.\n\nDefectors take steps to hide facts that can harm their reputation, or\nmanipulate facts to help their reputation. Recall that in the mid-1970s, [John\nWayne Gacy](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1166008)\nmanaged to rape and kill 33 young men. All the while, his Chicago neighbors\nand colleagues on civic and charitable committees never suspected “Pogo the\nClown” Gacy was involved in any work more diabolical than entertaining\nchildren for good causes. In the UK, [Dr. Harold\nShipman](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1166365) had\na similar story. Described as “a pillar of the community” by his neighbors, he\nkilled at least 250 people, mostly elderly widows, before he was caught. Most\nexamples are less extreme. A politician might go to church and publicly pray,\nto encourage people to think he's honest: a whited sepulchre. An American\ntrekking through Europe might sew a Canadian flag on his backpack.\n\nConfidence tricksters spend a lot of time manipulating reputation signals.\nThey employ all sorts of props, façades, and other actors—shills—to convince\ntheir victims that they have a good reputation by appearing authentic,\nbuilding confidence, and encouraging trust. Corporations and political\ncandidates both do similar things; they use paid supporters to deliberately\nspread artificial reputational information about them. This is becoming even\nmore prevalent and effective on the Internet. Hired hands write fake blog\nposts, blog comments, tweets, Facebook comments, and so on. Scammers on eBay\ncreate fake feedback, giving themselves a better reputation. There are even\ncompanies that will give you fake Facebook friends, making you seem more\npopular with attractive people than you actually are.\n\nDefectors try to minimize the effects of their bad reputation. People get new\nfriends, move to another city, or—in extreme cases—change their names, get\nplastic surgery, or steal someone else's identity. Philip Morris renamed\nitself Altria, because who would want to buy their Kraft Mac and Cheese from a\ncigarette company? ValuJet, its brand ruined after Flight 592 crashed in the\nEverglades in 1996, now operates as AirTran Airways. Blackwater, the defense\ncontractor notorious for numerous Iraq war abuses, became Xe Services and then\nAcademi. The School of the Americas, implicated in training many human\nrights–abusing military staff in Latin America, rebranded itself as the\nWestern Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.\n\nCorporations work to minimize the effects of negative reputation on their\nbrands through advertising and public relations. Multinational food and\nconsumer product companies like Unilever and Procter & Gamble deliberately\ndownplay their corporate brand and focus attention on their sub-brands. There\nare a lot of marketing reasons to engage in sub-branding, but the security\nthinking is that if there is a problem with one of their brands, the negative\npublicity won't spread across the company's entire product line.\n\nSome people simply don't care about reputation. Like our individual morals,\nour individual concern about reputation varies—from person to person as well\nas from situation to situation. Some of us care a lot; others, not so much. Of\ncourse, this is contextual. We all have different reputations in different\ngroups with respect to different personal attributes.\n\nSome people end up with the wrong reputation. Even if someone does nothing\nwrong, there's no guarantee that his reputation is accurate. Untrue stories\ncan circulate by mistake. Someone else might lie to give him a bad reputation.\nWe all know people who have reputations they don't deserve, both good and bad.\n\nDefectors band together in subgroups that have different reputational rules.\nGang members thrive in groups. Sure, they have a terrible reputation in the\nbroader community, but they care primarily about their reputation within their\ngangs. This dynamic is also true for defectors who have a different moral\nsystem from the dominant culture: a lone pot smoker in a pot-free community is\ngoing to have a lot harder time than one who finds other pot smokers in the\nvicinity. His friends will help him defect. In effect, he will choose to\ncooperate with the smaller society of defectors, rather than with the pot-\nabstaining majority. The same is true for those worshipping in secret out of\nfear: early Christians in the Roman Empire, pagans afterwards, Jews in post-\nexpulsion Spain, devout Russian Orthodox in the former Soviet Union. We'll\ntalk about this more in Chapters 11 and 12.\n\nThe value of defecting might be worth the reputational damage. Maybe it's a\nsingle large transaction, and the merchant is willing to sacrifice her\nreputation for the money. Or maybe it's a situation where the merchant can\noutrun his\nreputation.[22](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos995248)\nWe've all heard stories of home remodeling contractors that score a big\ncontract, and then either don't do the work or do a quick, shoddy job, and\ndisappear with the money. “Fly by night,” it's called. They've made the risk\ntrade-off and decided their reputation wasn't that valuable. If they're career\nscammers, a big payoff may even enhance their reputation among their fellow\nscammers. A restaurant owner in a tourist area could serve lousy food,\nconfident that the reputational damage matters less when there's no repeat\nclientele. A corporate CEO might decide his company's ability to repair\nreputational damage allows it to get away with misdeeds he wouldn't have\nauthorized if he didn't have such an effective public relations department.\n\nThe most important reason reputational pressure starts to fail is that groups\nget too\nlarge.[23](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos996031)\nAssisted by technology, reputational pressure can scale globally. Think of the\nreputations of public figures and celebrities, companies and brands, or\nindividuals on the Internet. Think of eBay's reputation system, review sites\nlike Yelp, or how we can make friends on shared-interest websites. Think of\nthe FBI's criminal databases, the information about you kept by credit\nbureaus, or Google's database of your interests. Think of passports, driver's\nlicenses, or employee badges. These are all reputational systems, and all\nserve to apply reputational pressure in different risk trade-offs.\n\nBut these systems can have all sorts of inaccuracies. What we know about\ncelebrities, corporations, and people in faraway places doesn't always match\nreality. It's not only the natural errors that creep into any large-scale\nprocess, it's that these systems can be manipulated and the technologies used\nto support them can be attacked. In order for reputation to scale, we need to\ntrust these reputational systems, but sometimes that trust is not well-\nfounded. We'll talk about this more in Chapter 10.\n\nReputational pressure works best within a group of people who know each other:\na group of friends or coworkers in an office, compared to a bunch of strangers\non a bus or a city full of people. Neighbors are good at [settling\ndisputes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1166714);\npeople who don't live so close to each other are less good at it.\n\nHowever, once the group size grows larger and the social ties between people\nweaken, reputation alone doesn't cut it.\n\nCommenting on Hardin's original Tragedy of the Commons paper, psychologist\nJulian Edney wrote that “the upper limit for a simple, self-contained,\nsustaining, well-functioning commons may be as low as 150\npeople.”[24](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos996695)\n\nEleven years later, [Dunbar\nwrote](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1167044):\n\n> The Hutterites, a group of contemporary North American religious\n> fundamentalists who live and farm communally, regard 150 as the maximum size\n> for their communities.

But it's not self-policing, and not just\nbecause we're wary of vigilantism. It's simply a natural effect of increasing\nthe scale of the underlying social group.\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nInstitutional Pressures\n\nStore owners generally get to set their own hours. If their customers tend to\nshop early, the store opens early. If their customers tend to sleep in, the\nstore doesn't open until late morning. Nights, weekends, holidays: a smart\nstore owner is going to match his store's hours to his customers' needs.\n\nThis isn't true of stores in a shopping mall. Shopping malls have preset\nhours, and if you have a store in the mall, you have to adhere to those hours.\nIt doesn't matter who your customers are. Called a “[continuous operations\nclause](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1167865),”\nit's written into most mall leases.\n\nThis solves a societal dilemma: stores are individually better off if they can\nset their hours to suit their business, but the stores are collectively better\noff if everyone shares the same hours so customers know that everything will\nbe open when they go. To ensure that stores follow the group interest, mall\noperators enforce continuous operations clauses through steep fines.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Mall hours.  \n---  \nSociety: Group of merchants.  \nGroup interest: Mall stores all have uniform hours. | Competing interest: Maximize short-term profits.  \nGroup norm: Stay open during agreed upon hours. | Corresponding defection: Open and close when it makes financial sense.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, society implements these\nsocietal pressures:\n\n> > Institutional: The group fines stores that close during common hours.  \n  \nAs we saw in the previous chapter, solving a Prisoner's Dilemma involves\nchanging the costs and benefits of acting in the person's selfish interest\nversus acting in the group interest. Shopping malls solve their Prisoner's\nDilemma by using fines. A fine raises the cost of a store owner acting in his\nself-interest. Raise that cost high enough, and owners will open and close\ntheir stores in unison.\n\nThe common mall hours, and the fines for violating them, are an example of an\ninstitutional societal pressure. It's a rule established by the institution\nthat owns the mall—it might even be a cooperative institution consisting of\nall the stores—that the society of store owners all agree to.\n\nPolitical philosophers have long argued that informal societal pressures\naren't enough for a successful human society. Thomas Hobbes, writing in the\nmid-17th century, believed individuals couldn't be trusted, and the\nopportunities to defect were simply too tempting. In this “state of\nnature”—that's anarchy, although he never used the word—our lives would be\n“[solitary, poor,\nnasty](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1168254),\nbrutish, and short.” [Martin Luther\nsaid](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1168598) the\nsame thing, a century earlier.\n\n[Immanuel\nKant](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1168877) put it\nthis way at the end of the 18th century:\n\n> The problem of organizing a state, however hard it may seem, can be solved\n> even for a race of devils, if only they are intelligent. The problem is:\n> “Given a multitude of rational beings requiring universal laws for their\n> preservation, but each of whom is secretly inclined to exempt himself from\n> them, to establish a constitution in such a way that, although their private\n> intentions conflict, they check each other, with the result that their\n> public conduct is the same as if they had no such intentions.”\n\nThe result is Social Contract Theory, which posits that people willingly grant\ngovernment power that compels them to subordinate their immediate self-\ninterest to the long-term group interest in order to protect themselves and\ntheir fellow citizens from harm. Thomas Hobbes, [John\nLocke](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1169176),\n[Jean-Jacques\nRousseau](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1116104),\nand the 20th-century philosopher [John\nRawls](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1169721) all\nproposed different flavors of this idea. Their conclusions about the ideal way\nto achieve social order vary, but all maintain that it is both necessary and\nmoral to forcibly limit individual freedoms, reasoning that without a\ngovernment enforcing laws, defectors would take over, to the detriment of all.\n\nAt its basest form, it's an argument we've seen in the previous chapter: fear\nof punishment is what keeps the tempted honest. [In Plato's\nRepublic](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1170023),\nGlaucon argues that if you remove that fear, the righteous will behave no\ndifferently than the wicked: “Mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may\nbe the victims of it and not because they shrink from committing it.” During\nthe Italian Renaissance, [Niccolò\nMachiavelli](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1170304)\nbuilt an entire political philosophy around this principle.\n\n> Men never act well except through necessity: but where choice abounds and\n> where license may be used, everything is quickly filled with confusion and\n> disorder. It is said therefore that Hunger and Poverty make men industrious,\n> and Laws make them good.\n\nOf course, that's not precisely true. The righteous aren't really just\ncalculating scoundrels behaving well only because they fear that someone\nelse—or perhaps God—will punish them if they step out of line. Reciprocal\naltruism works, and most people are honest most of the time. It's the\ndefectors that Machiavelli was talking about, and for them he got it mostly\nright.\n\nLaws, regulations, and rules in general are all institutional societal\npressures. They're similar to reputational pressure, but formalized. We all\nagree to comply with all sorts of institutional pressures as a precondition of\nbeing part of a group, the most common of which are the laws by which we agree\nto be bound as a condition of being part of whatever political units we're\npart of. (It's certainly debatable whether individuals “agree to be bound by”\nall of the rules that end up being applicable to them, but that's generally\nhow political philosophers look at it.)\n\nIt's not always clear exactly when informal social mores become rules. The\nsocial pathologists make a distinction between codified and explicit norms\nestablished by the government and non-formal norms agreed upon by the group,\nbut that leaves a large grey area for less-official groups. Still, codifying\nour reputational pressure into laws was a big step for the development of\nsociety, and it allowed larger and more complex social groupings—like cities.\n\n[Garrett\nHardin](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1170627), who\ncreated the phrase “the Tragedy of the Commons,” later wished he'd called it\n“the tragedy of the unmanaged commons.” The point of his paper was not that\ndefectors will inevitably ruin things for the group, but that unless things\nare managed properly, they will. He was stressing the need for institutional\npressure.\n\nInstitutional pressure requires an institution for implementation and\nenforcement; I mean the term very broadly. Institutions include governments of\nall sizes, but also religious institutions, corporations, criminal\norganizations, and so on. These institutions implement rules, laws,\nedicts—there are several terms—and sanctions for disobeying them and possibly\nincentives to obey them.\n\nBurglary has costs that exceed the value of the goods stolen. Burglary costs\nin the time and effort to replace what's been stolen, the psychological effect\nof having one's home violated, the cost to the community of investigating the\ncrime and prosecuting the accused, and even the cost of defending the suspect\nif he happens to be indigent. Sometimes the costs to the burglarized far\nexceed the value to the burglar: think of someone who steals copper wire out\nof a data center to sell as scrap metal, or destroys a building to get at\nvaluables inside. But these costs are not borne by the burglar. They are\nexternalities to him.\n\nA well-written law combined with proper enforcement raises the costs to the\nburglar to the point where he is forced to bear the full costs of his actions.\nIt could even raise the costs to the point where breaking, entering, and\nstealing is a worse trade-off than buying the same things legitimately.\n\nVoting is another example. In the U.S., voter turnout is so low in part\nbecause there's no legal requirement to vote. In countries where [voting is\nrequired](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1170971) by\nlaw—Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, etc.—turnout is much higher. This is also\ntrue in countries that don't have explicit voting laws, but have laws that\nraise the cost of not voting in other ways. For example, in Greece, it's\nharder for non-voters to get a passport or driver's license. If you don't vote\nin Singapore, you're removed from the electoral rolls and must provide a\nreason when you reapply. In Peru, your stamped voting card is necessary to\nobtain some government services. And in Mexico and Italy, there are informal\nconsequences of not voting, harking back to the previous chapter. These\n“innocuous sanctions,” as they're called in Italy, make it—for example—harder\nto get day care for your child.\n\nDeacon's Paradox is another example. The societal dilemma looks like this:\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Respecting pair bonds.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Everyone trusts each other enough to go about daily tasks away from their long-term partners. | Competing interest: Maximize personal pleasure, maximize gene propagation.  \nGroup norm: Respect each other's pair bonds. | Corresponding defection: Have sex with whomever you want.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, society implements these\nsocietal pressures:\n\n> > Moral: Teaching that adultery is wrong. The occasional commandment.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Public shaming of people who break their marriage vows.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Legal marriage contracts. Adultery laws.  \n  \nInitially, [marriage rites were\ninformal](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1171295) and\nreputational; both religious and civil institutions formalized them as we\ndeveloped rules about property and inheritance. Of course, this isn't perfect.\nPhilandering is as old as human society; rules are generally only selectively\nenforced, and friends of a philanderer will always be tempted to look the\nother way. But formalized marriage rules have been in effect throughout\nhistory, and they're largely effective.\n\nGridlock is another example. If you've ever driven in a crowded city center,\nyou know the problem. Drivers stay as close as possible to the car in front of\nthem, so no one will be able to cut in front of them and they will get where\nthey're going as quickly as possible. The inevitable result of this strategy\nis that cars get stuck in the middle of an intersection when the light turns\nred, and cars going the other way can't pass. This is both inconvenient and a\ndanger to public safety as emergency vehicles become unable to pass through\nthe congestion. In extreme cases, gridlock can tie up traffic for hours.\nEveryone would do better if no one entered the intersection until the car was\nable to completely clear it on the other side, but unless everyone shows\nrestraint, those who do are penalized. The solution: in many cities, it's now\nillegal to enter an intersection if you are unable to pass completely through\nwithout blocking cross-traffic.\n\nSome societal dilemmas are particularly resistant to institutional pressure.\nKidnapping and piracy are two examples. The dilemma is obvious. Kidnapping and\npiracy are bad for society, so paying ransom is bad because it makes these\ncrimes profitable and emboldens those who commit them. Nonetheless, each and\nevery one of us wants an exception to be made if we, our loved ones, or our\ncargo are held for ransom. So people follow their self-interest, their self-\npreservation interest, or their relational interest and pay up. This practice\nhas made kidnapping profitable in many countries, most notably Mexico,\nColombia, and Iraq, and has contributed to the escalation of piracy in\nSoutheast Asia and off the coast of Somalia. All of these countries could pass\nlaws making it illegal to pay kidnapping ransoms, but those would be hard to\nenforce. Both parties to these transactions want to hide them from the\nauthorities. It's not enough to declare kidnapping illegal; enforcement\nmatters, and most high-kidnapping and high-piracy countries have ineffective\npolice forces at best, or corrupt police serving as [accomplices at\nworst](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1171646).\nPiracy has an additional externality; the costs are not borne by the country\nthat hosts the\npirates.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos998574) In\ncountries like the United States, harsh enforcement has made kidnapping for\nransom a very rare crime, and piracy nearly nonexistent. In other countries,\nlike Somalia, paying ransoms is common, even though the government\n[occasionally\njails](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1172007) those\nwho do so.\n\nCompare this to bribery. Like kidnapping, bribery of public officials is a\nsocietal dilemma. Society is much better off without bribery, but when\nindividuals are faced with a recalcitrant government official, they can be\neasily motivated to ignore that and pay up. Where bribery is illegal for both\nthe giver and the receiver, both parties have an incentive to hide the bribe\nfrom the police, which makes enforcement of anti-bribery laws difficult. (The\nfact that it's sometimes the police who have to be bribed makes it even\nworse.) India's chief economic advisor recently argued that, for some classes\nof bribes, [offering a\nbribe](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1172373) should\nbe decriminalized. The rationale here is that if the bribe giver is not\ntreated as a criminal, he will be more willing to help prosecute public\nemployees who demand bribes. Of course, this only works for one-time bribes,\nwhere an official is demanding payment for a service that the recipient should\nnormally receive. It doesn't work for bribes in which an official is being\nasked to do something he shouldn't normally do, or for a series of bribes over\ntime. In all cases, the bribe payer would not want to make his actions public,\nregardless of the law. But in the more normal case of a government official\ntrying to line his pockets through a one-off transaction, decriminalizing the\nbribe giver's actions would make it more likely for him to go\npublic.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos998962)\n\nSimilarly, while it's bad policy to negotiate with terrorists, it's [easy to\nmake\nexceptions](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1172787).\nAt the height of the IRA's bombing campaign in the UK, Prime Minister Thatcher\nwas publicly affirming that her government would never negotiate with\nterrorists while at the same time conducting secret back-channel negotiations\nwith senior IRA figures. This was in addition to the negotiations the non-\nmilitarist wing of the IRA was conducting with the British government.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nJust like reputational pressure, institutional pressure requires consequences\nto work. The difference is that while reputational consequences are informal,\ninstitutional consequences are formal, codified, and tangible. These can be\npunishments, more properly called sanctions, or rewards, better called\nincentives.\n\nThink back to Bob and Alice in their respective prison cells, making their own\nrisk trade-offs. Not implicating others enhances the reputation of a criminal;\nadditionally, criminal organizations hunt down and punish those who don't keep\nsilent.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Criminals testifying against each other.  \n---  \nSociety: The criminal organization.  \nGroup interest: Minimize the amount of punishment for the society. | Competing interest: Minimize personal punishment.  \nGroup norm: Don't testify against each other. | Corresponding defection: Testify against each other in exchange for reduced punishment.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of trust mechanisms.\n\n> > Moral: People feel good when they support other members of their group,\n> and bad when they let them down.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Those who testify against their fellow criminals are shunned.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: The criminal organization severely punishes stool pigeons.  \n  \nYou could argue whether the criminal code of silence—and the practice of\nkilling police informants—belongs in this chapter or the previous one. I\nsuppose it depends on how formal the rules are. Certainly it goes far beyond\nshunning.\n\nSanctions serve several purposes. Modern penologists hold that prisons are\nprimarily intended to reeducate and reform, minimizing recidivism. Financial\nsanctions serve as a penalty, raising the financial cost of defecting. And,\nunfortunately, both have an aspect of revenge about them—another formalization\nof reputational\npressure.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos999366)\nBut the part of it that matters most for societal pressure is the deterrent\neffect. A rule or law will encourage some people to cooperate simply based on\ntheir innate moral tendency to obey authority and follow the rules, but\nprimarily—like reputational systems—laws rely on punishment as a deterrent to\ndefection. Unlike reputational systems, though, imposing sanctions is more\nformalized.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos999918)\nThis doesn't necessarily mean something that has been written down and agreed\nto like a legal code, although it generally is. Sanctions reduce the number of\ndefections. And recalling the Bad Apple Effect from Chapter 7, they prevent\nfurther defections.\n\nThe general idea of such rewards is to formalize coercion. Even prohibitive\nlaws have some aspect of this; they're prescriptive as well as punitive. They\noperate both before the decision about whether to cooperate or defect occurs,\nby providing guidelines for acceptable behavior and prior notification of any\npenalties, and afterwards, through enforcement.\n\nLaws are only as good as society's ability to enforce them. It's not enough to\npass a law requiring people to pay their taxes, or banning child labor, or\nlimiting the amount of insect parts in your breakfast cereal; if you don't\nalso sanction defectors, the laws will not act as much of a deterrent. Fines\nhave to be assessed and collected. Jail time has to be served. And all of this\nhas to be implemented with an eye towards solving the societal dilemma.\n\n[Alexander\nHamilton](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1173083)\nsaid as much in The Federalist 15:\n\n> It is essential to the idea of a law, that it be attended with a sanction;\n> or, in other words, a penalty or punishment for disobedience. If there be no\n> penalty annexed to disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend\n> to be laws will, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or\n> recommendation.\n\nSanctions fall into three basic categories: confiscation of resources or\npossessions, shaming, or physical penalties. Fines and forced servitude fall\ninto the first category, and the last category further breaks down into\nincarceration, physical harm, and execution. Shaming and physical harm were\nmore common historically; the stocks are a good example of both, as people\nrestrained by them could be abused by the community. Sex offender registries\nare a common modern shaming sanction, but others—such as requiring an offender\nto stand in a public place wearing a sign that broadcasts the nature of his\noffense—are slowly making a comeback, in spite of persuasive arguments that\nthey are [immoral,\nineffective](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1173544),\nand degrade the public as much as those subjected to them. House arrest,\nmonitored by an electronic bracelet, has a shaming aspect too. So does\ncommunity service, if it's obvious and in public.\n\nMost modern sanctions consist of either incarceration or financial penalties.\nIncarceration removes the defector from society for a period of time, and\nprevents him from committing further defections. Done right, jail is a place\nto reform criminals. Done wrong, jail is a place where criminals learn how to\nbe better criminals.\n\nFinancial penalties can be tricky to implement, and are therefore worthy of a\nlonger discussion. Speeding is a risk trade-off. There are risks to\nspeeding—accidents—but there are also rewards, such as getting to your\ndestination sooner or the adrenaline rush that comes with driving faster.\nThere are all sorts of pathologies in the trade-off—the rewards are immediate\nand constant, but the risks are nebulous and only happen occasionally—and one\nmight think there's no reason society can't just let people make the trade-\noffs by themselves.\n\nThe problem is that when Alice speeds, she also increases the risk to everyone\naround\nher.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1000470) So\nthere is a societal dilemma at work, and if you want Alice not to speed you're\ngoing to have to make it illegal and penalize her for doing it. Studies show\nthat [fines reduce\nspeeding](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1174450)\noverall, even though they don't deter habitual speeders. Drunk driving laws\nand their enforcement are a similar example.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Speeding.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Minimize automobile deaths. | Competing interest: Minimize travel time.  \nGroup norm: Obey speed limits. | Corresponding defection: Speed.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of trust mechanisms.\n\n> > Moral: It's moral to drive in a way that doesn't endanger others. Also,\n> it's moral to follow the rules.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: There is some social pressure, in some circles, not to be\nknown as a speeder or a reckless driver.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Speed limits.  \n  \nIt's vital for the financial penalties to be high enough to make the behavior\nunprofitable. For example, if customs has a 10% chance of catching a smuggler,\nthen the penalty for smuggling needs to be at least ten times the value of the\ngoods—otherwise it would make financial sense to smuggle. One report\ndemonstrated that [uninsured\ndrivers](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1175338) in\nthe UK are capable of doing the math, and will remain uninsured if the\nexpected penalty for doing so is less than the cost of insurance. This is even\nmore important when dealing with corporations; there are many examples of\nfines being so small as to be viewed as an incidental cost of doing business.\nWe'll talk about this more in Chapter 13.\n\nFixed financial penalties are regressive. Like everything else about the\nspeeding trade-off, the cost of a speeding ticket is relative. If you're poor,\na $100 speeding ticket is a lot of money. If you're rich, it's a minor cost of\nthe trip.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1000887)\nFinland, Denmark, and Switzerland address the problem by [basing traffic\nfines](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1175710) on the\noffender's income. Wealthy people in those countries have regularly been\nissued speeding tickets costing over $100,000. You might disagree with the\nsystem as a matter of policy, but it certainly is a more broadly effective\nsocietal pressure. Jail time for speeders accomplishes much the same thing.\n\nThere are two basic ways the law can prescribe financial penalties. It can\npass a direct law, or it can institutionalize liabilities. If the affected\nindividuals can sue the defectors and win sufficient punitive damages, that\nwill also increase the cost of defecting. In both cases, laws remove the\nexternality by making sure the defector pays the cost of defection. Watch how\nit works:\n\n  * Overfishing. Pass and enforce a law fining (or even jailing) those who overfish, and the dilemma goes away. Assuming the cost of the fine multiplied by the probability of getting caught—that's “cost” defined broadly, in terms of money, jail time, social stigma, whatever—is greater than the value of the additional fish, it changes Alice's risk trade-off.\n\n  * Polluting the river. Allow people living downstream from the polluter to sue. Assuming the court system works properly, the cost of the lawsuits to the polluter will be greater than the cost not to pollute the river.\n\n  * Unsafe food handling. Consumer protection laws raise the cost of ignoring food safety—presumably to save money—by imposing financial penalties on those who engage in it.\n\nAll this assumes a system where both the plaintiff and the defendant can\nafford the same quality of legal representation. The trade-off changes when\nthe river polluters are corporations with deep pockets, and the people\naffected don't have the means to pay for lawyers. Or when the bad behavior\noccurs when foreign companies import food into another country, and the\nprobability of getting caught is low. Again, we'll return to these\nconsiderations in Chapter 13.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nTaxes can be another type of institutional pressure. It's weird, because it\ndoesn't actually prohibit anything. But if the goal is to reduce the scope of\ndefection, charging people for their marginal defection is one way to do it.\nLike fines, taxes increase the cost of defecting. But unlike fines, they\noperate during and not after the\ndefection.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1001668)\nFor example, a sanction for littering requires the authorities to detect the\ncrime and then assess the penalty. This happens after the littering occurs,\nand there's always the chance of not getting caught. A tax on excess trash\noccurs at the time of trash pickup, although the person may pay the tax later.\n\nThe societal dilemma surrounding antibiotics mirrors the one surrounding\nvaccination: overuse vs. underuse. It's in everyone's immediate self-interest\nto use antibiotics to treat conditions that respond to them, but if they're\noverused, bacteria develop resistance, making them ineffective for everyone. A\nbig part of the problem is the wholesale use of antibiotics in agriculture:\nadministering antibiotics to livestock in order to produce faster growth,\nregardless of whether they are needed to treat disease. The problem of\nantibiotic-resistant supergerms is an externality. But doctors also contribute\nsignificantly to the problem; they frequently prescribe antibiotics in cases\nwhere they're not really necessary. But here again, use of antibiotics makes\nsense from the perspective of the doctor, who reasons that they won't hurt and\nmight help the immediate patient, whose patients regularly ask for them, and\nto whom the larger social costs are an externality as well.\n\nOne solution, proposed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, is to\n[tax the use of\nantibiotics](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1176455).\nThis is a societal pressure, increasing the cost of using antibiotics as a way\nto remove the externality. We can debate the effectiveness of the measure:\nit'll definitely help in agricultural uses, but how much it will reduce\nsuperfluous doctor prescriptions will depend on who pays the tax and how. Not\nto mention how easy it would be to smuggle in untaxed antibiotics.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThe converse of penalties are incentives: rewarding someone for cooperating.\nThere is a whole class of institutional pressure systems designed to reward\ncooperative behavior. Examples include:\n\n  * Tax deductions or tax credits for certain behaviors.\n\n  * Faster tax refunds for people who file their returns electronically.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1002133)\n\n  * Time off a prison sentence for good behavior.\n\n  * Employee bonuses.\n\n  * Bounties and rewards for turning in wanted fugitives.\n\n  * Deferred or non-prosecution of SEC violations as an incentive to provide evidence against other, larger, violators.\n\n  * Certifications, both coercive ones (FDA approval for new drugs) and optional ones (LEED certifications for buildings).\n\n  * Whistle-blower statutes, where the whistle-blower gets a percentage of the fraud found.\n\nThe problem with rewarding cooperators via an institutional mechanism is that\nit's expensive. If we assume that the majority will cooperate regardless of\nthe reward, then a lot of people will get a reward for doing what they were\ngoing to do already. Either the reward will have to be very small and not much\nof an additional incentive to cooperate, or the total cost of rewarding\neveryone will be very expensive. In general, it's more efficient to spend that\nmoney going after the minority of defectors.\n\nFinancial incentives and penalties interact weirdly with other categories of\nsocietal pressures. It's easy to regard societal pressures as cumulative—and\nto assume that moral plus institutional pressure will be more effective than\nmorals alone—but our moral systems are more complicated than that.\n\n[In one\nexperiment](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1176892),\nparticipants were presented with a societal dilemma: they were in charge of a\nmanufacturing plant that emitted toxic gas from its smokestacks. They could\neither spend more money to clean up a lot of the toxin, or spend less money to\nclean up a little bit of the toxin. The dilemma came from the fact that\npending government legislation—a bad thing in the experiment's\nscenario—depended on how much cleaning up the manufacturing plants did\ncollectively. It's a free-rider problem: a subject could either cooperate and\nclean up his share, or defect and hope enough others cleaned up enough to\nforestall legislation.\n\nWhat makes this experiment particularly interesting is that half of the\nsubjects were also told that the industry would be inspecting smokestacks to\nverify compliance and fining defectors. It wasn't a big risk; both the chance\nof inspection and the cost of noncompliance were low. Still, inspections are a\nsocietal pressure, and you'd expect they would have some positive effect on\ncompliance rates. Unexpectedly, they had a negative effect: subjects were more\nlikely to cooperate if there were no noncompliance fines than if there were.\nThe addition of money made it a financial rather than a moral decision.\nParadoxically, financial penalties intended to discourage harmful behavior can\nhave the reverse effect.\n\nFor this reason, signs featuring anti-littering slogans like “Don't Mess with\nTexas” are more effective than signs that only warn, “Penalty for Littering:\n$100”; and “smoking in hotel rooms is prohibited” signs are more effective\nthan signs that read “$250 cleaning penalty if you smoke.” In one experiment\nwith day care providers, researchers found that when they [instituted a\nfine](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1177291) for\nparents picking their children up late, late pickups increased. The fine\nbecame a fee, which parents could decide to pay and assuage any moral\nresistance to defection.\n\nMore generally, the very existence of rules or laws can counter moral and\nreputational pressure. Some [towns are\nexperimenting](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1177636)\nwith eliminating all traffic laws and signs. The idea is that drivers who must\nfollow the rules pay less attention to the world around them than drivers with\nno rules to follow.\n\nFinancial rewards have the same effect that financial penalties do; they\nengage the brain's greed system and disengage the moral system. A fascinating\n[incident in\nSwitzerland](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1178356)\nillustrates this. Trying to figure out where to put a nuclear waste dump,\nresearchers polled residents of several small towns about how they would feel\nabout it being located near them. This was 1993, and a lot of fear surrounded\nthe issue; nonetheless, slightly more than half of the residents agreed to\ntake the risk, for the good of the country.\n\nIn order to motivate the other half, the researchers offered money in exchange\nfor siting the nuclear dump near them: about $2,000 per person per year.\nInstead of enticing more residents to accept the dump, it reduced their number\nby half. The researchers doubled and then tripled the amount offered, but it\ndidn't make a difference. When they simply asked nicely, the researchers\nstimulated the altruistic part of the residents' brains—and, in many cases,\nthey decided it was the right thing to do. Again, the addition of money can\nincrease the defection\nrate.[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1002543)\n\nFinancial advisors exhibit this unconscious bias in favor of their clients. In\none experiment, analysts [gave different\nweights](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1178778) to\nthe same information, depending on what the client wanted to hear. An obvious\nsocietal pressure system to address this problem would be to [require\nadvisors](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1179178) to\ndisclose any conflicts of interest; but this can have the reverse effect of\nincreasing the number of defectors. By disclosing their conflicts, financial\nadvisors may feel they have been granted a moral license to pursue their own\nself-interest, and may feel partially absolved of their professional\nobligation to be objective.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nElinor Ostrom received a Nobel Prize in 2009 for studying how societies deal\nwith Tragedies of the Commons: grazing rights in the Swiss Alps, fishing\nrights off the coast of Turkey, irrigation communities in the Philippines.\nShe's studied commons around the world, and has a list of rules for\nsuccessfully managing\nthem.[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1003517)\nGeneralizing them to our broad spectrum of societal dilemmas, they serve as a\nprimer for effective institutional pressure:\n\n> > 1.

If there are larger groups and larger group interests, then the groups\nneed to be scaled properly and nested in multiple layers—each operating along\nthese same lines.\n\nOstrom's rules may very well be the closest model we have to our species'\nfirst successful set of institutional pressures. They're not imposed from\nabove; they grow organically from the group. Societies of resource users are\n[able to self-\nregulate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1179608) if\nthey follow these rules, and that self-regulation is stable over the long\nterm. It's generally when [outsiders come\nin](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1180616) and\ninstitutionalize a resource-management system that things start to fail.\n\nI mentioned institutional pressure as a formalization of reputational\npressure. This works in several ways. Laws formalize reputation itself. In\nChapter 8, we talked about group membership as a substitute for individual\nreputation. As societies grow, laws formalize some group memberships.\n\nFor example, doctors need a license to practice. So do architects, engineers,\nprivate investigators, plumbers, and real estate agents. Restaurants need\nlicenses and regular inspections by health officials to operate. The basic\nidea is that these official certifications provide a basis for people to trust\nthese doctors, private investigators, and restaurants without knowing anything\nabout their reputations. Certification informs potential clients that a\nbusinessperson has at least the minimum formal education and skill required to\nsafely and competently perform the service in question, and that the\nbusinessperson is accountable to someone other than the customer: a licensing\nbody, a trade organization, and so on. Handicap license plates are another\nformalized reputational system. Not all certifications are controlled by the\ngovernment; some come from private institutions, such as Underwriter's\nLaboratories' certifications, the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, Consumer\nReports rankings, and a variety of computer standards.\n\nOther formal memberships that serve as reputation substitutes include academic\ndegrees, bar associations for lawyers, the Better Business Bureau, food\nproducts' labels of origin—appellation d'origine contrôlée in France, and U.S.\ncounterparts like “Wisconsin cheese” and “Made in Vermont”—USDA Organic\ncertification, consumer credit ratings and reports, bonding, accreditation of\neducational institutions.\n\nNegative reputation can also be institutionalized: public sex-offender\nregistries, the DHS terrorist “no fly” list, blacklists for union organizers\nor suspected Communists, and designations on driver's licenses of a felony\nconviction. [The scarlet\nletter](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1181030) is an\nolder example, and the yellow star the Nazis required Jews to wear is a\nparticularly despicable one.\n\nLaws also formalize commitment. Legal contracts are probably the best example.\nMarriage licenses, curfew laws, and laws that enforce parents' commitment to\nraise their children are others.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Following contracts.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Effectively formalize agreements. | Competing interest: Maximize some self-interest.  \nGroup norm: Follow contracts. | Corresponding defection: Break contracts.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of trust mechanisms.\n\n> > Moral: We feel good about keeping our word.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: No one does business with individuals and companies with a\nreputation for breaking contracts.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: There are all sorts of laws regarding the legality of\ncontracts, and sanctions for breaking them.  \n  \nFinally, laws formalize societal norms that reputation traditionally enforced:\nanti-incest laws and age-of-consent laws, minimum drinking ages, bans on false\nadvertising, blue laws, public indecency/intoxication laws, city lawn and weed\nordinances, noise ordinances, libel and slander laws, zoning regulations, laws\nagainst impersonating police officers, and—in a perverse way—laws prohibiting\npeople from criticizing the government. Employment applications that ask if\nyou have ever been convicted of a felony are a formalization of reputation.\n\nAll of these institutional pressures allow reputation to scale, by giving\npeople a system to trust so they don't have to necessarily trust individuals.\nIf I trust the system of government-issued identification cards and driver's\nlicenses, I don't have to wonder whether to trust each and every a person when\nhe tells me he's old enough to drink in my bar.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThere are many ways institutional pressure fails:\n\nThere is too little or too much of it. We've seen how institutional pressure\nis required to augment moral and reputational pressures in large and complex\nsocieties. Too little institutional pressure and the scope of defection is too\ngreat. For example, there's more tax evasion if the crime goes unpunished.\n\nBut more institutional pressure isn't always better. Gary Becker won a Nobel\nPrize in economics in part for his work in criminology. He asked the obvious\nquestion, what's the optimal level of crime? The naïve answer is zero, but\nthat is unattainable and requires so much institutional pressure that society\nfalls apart. Too much institutional pressure, and you get a country that looks\nlike North Korea or the former East Germany: police states with a good part of\nthe population working for the police. The other extreme—no police—doesn't\nwork, either. You get lawless countries like Afghanistan and Somalia.\nSomewhere in the middle is the optimal scope of defection and the optimal\nlevel of enforcement.\n\nIn a lot of ways, this is similar to how evolution solves security problems.\nAntelopes don't need perfect protection against lions, and such protection\nwould be too expensive in evolutionary terms. Instead, they accept the cost of\nlosing the occasional antelope from the herd and increase their reproductive\nefficiency to compensate.\n\nSimilarly, we can never ensure perfect security against terrorism. All this\ntalk of terrorism as an [existential\nthreat](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1181514) to\nsociety is nonsense. As long as terrorism is rare enough, and most people\nsurvive, society will survive. Unfortunately, it's not politically viable to\ncome out and say that. We're collectively in a pathological state where people\nexpect perfect protection against a host of problems—not just terrorism—and\nare unwilling to accept that that is not a reasonable goal.\n\nLaws don't always have their intended effect. They can be a blunt tool,\nespecially when it comes to violent crime and disaffected populations. There\nisn't a clean cause-and-effect relationship between incentives and behavior;\nmore often than not, incentives are emotional, and are far more compelling\nthan a rational consideration of even the most severe\nsanction.[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1006265)\nThere's a lot of research in this area, with many counterintuitive—and\nsometimes contradictory—results. We know that, in general, spending more money\non police reduces crime somewhat. On the other hand, there are studies that\ndemonstrate that the [death penalty\nreduces](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1181880)\nmurders as well as studies that [demonstrate it\ndoesn't](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1183026).\nWhile it's easy for politicians to be “tough on crime,” it's not always\nobvious that that's the best solution. An increase in the severity of\npunishment often doesn't translate into a drop in crime; an increase in the\n[probability of\npunishment](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1184197)\noften\ndoes.[12](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1007232)\nOften the [societal causes of\ncrime](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1184935) are\nwhat's important, and changes in the law do very little to help.\n\nLaws have a clearer effect on more calculating crimes. Increasing penalties\nagainst tax fraud reduces tax fraud, at least for a little while. Increasing\npenalties on corporate crimes reduces those crimes. In those instances,\npotential defectors have plenty of time to make a rational risk trade-\noff.[13](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1007637)\n\nIt's not always possible to enforce a law. International law, for example,\nonly matters to the extent that the countries are willing to observe it or are\nable to enforce it on each other. Viktor Bout was an international arms dealer\nfor about twenty years before his arrest in 2008. He was able to ship weapons\nto every conflict region imaginable, even those under UN embargo. He benefited\nfrom the lack of international law addressing transnational criminal activity,\ndeliberately slack customs enforcement in countries seeking to attract\nbusiness, and nations that found it convenient to let him do their dirty work.\n\nLaws are open to interpretation, and that interpretation process can be\nexpensive. Earlier I talked about solving the societal dilemma of pollution\nwith a legal security measure: allowing people downstream from the polluter to\nsue. This is good in theory, but can be problematic in practice. The polluter\ncan hire a team of lawyers skilled in the art of legal delay. If the cost of\nthe lawyers is less than the cost of cleaning up the pollution, or if the\npolluter can outspend his legal opponents, he can neutralize their ability to\nraise the cost of defecting. This kind of expensive legal defense can also\nwork against government regulations, tying the case up in the courts until the\ngovernment gives up. In the state anti-trust suits against Microsoft, almost\nall states settled before trial.\n\n[Laws can have\nloopholes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1185321).\nThis can happen by accident, when laws are linguistically ambiguous, contain\nsimple errors, or fail to anticipate some new technological development. It\ncan also happen deliberately, when laws are miswritten to enable the skillful\nfew to evade them.\n\nExamples of accidental loopholes are the “Double Irish” and “Dutch Sandwich”\nloopholes that allow multinational corporations to avoid U.S.—and\nother—taxes.[14](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1008265)\nIt's how [Google\npays](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1185670) only\n2.8% of profits in tax. One estimate claims the U.S. loses $60 billion per\nyear in taxes this way. Another loophole allows [large paper\nmills](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1185998) to\nclaim $6 billion in tax credits per year for mixing diesel fuel in with a wood\nbyproduct they already burn; the law with the loophole was intended to reduce\nthe consumption of fossil\nfuels.[15](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1009144) A\nvariety of loopholes make [video\ngames](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1186569) one of\nthe most highly subsidized industries in the U.S. And, so as not to entirely\npick on the U.S., the International Whaling Commission's loophole for research\nthat [Japan\nexploits](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1186905) to\nhunt whales commercially is another example.\n\nAlthough it's hard to prove, there are many examples of laws believed to be\ndeliberately written with loopholes to benefit someone. The UN Convention on\nthe [Law of the\nSea](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1187639)\nprovisions on international fisheries are deliberately ambiguous, making much\nof it impossible to enforce. Also at the UN, [Security Council Resolution\n1441](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1188034)—used to\njustify invading Iraq—seems to have been designed to be ambiguous enough to\nboth support and oppose the use of force.\n\nMore generally, loopholes are ways institutional pressure is subverted by\ndefectors to do things it wasn't originally intended to do. Think of patent\nlaw, originally intended to protect inventors but now used by corporations to\nattack other corporations, or by patent trolls to extort money out of\ncorporations. Or the legal profession, originally intended to serve justice\nbut now used as an offensive weapon. Or stocks, originally intended to provide\ncapital for companies but now used for all sorts of unintended purposes: weird\nderivatives, indexes, short-term trading, and so on. These are all defections.\nEither the law should be effective, or it shouldn't exist. A law with a\nloophole is the worst of both.\n\nLaws can be applied inconsistently. If laws aren't objective, common, and\nuniversally applied, they are seen as unfair; and unfairness can exacerbate\nthe Bad Apple Effect.\n\n[Judge Gordon\nHewart](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1188435) put\nit best:\n\n> There is no doubt, as has been said in a long line of cases, that it is not\n> merely of some importance, but of fundamental importance, that justice\n> should both be done and be manifestly seen to be done.\n\nLaws try to outlaw legitimate and moral behavior. Sometimes it's perfectly\nlegitimate for someone to follow her individual self-interest, regardless of\nthe group interest. There's no inherent dividing line, and different\npeople—and societies—will draw it differently.\n\n[Invasive\nspecies](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1188789) are\nat best a serious problem, and at worst an [ecological\ndisaster](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1189137).\nThey also pose a societal dilemma in which even a single defector can cause\nthe group severe harm. All it took was one farmer releasing [silver\ncarp](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1189542) into\nthe natural waterways of North America for it to invade everywhere, one flight\naccidentally carrying a [pregnant brown tree\nsnake](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1189954) to\ndecimate the ecosystem of Guam, and one boat with [zebra mussel\nlarvae](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1190410) in\nits ballast water or milfoil clinging to its hull to overwhelm a previously\npristine lake. As such, there need to be some pretty strong societal pressures\nin place to deal with this problem.\n\nSome invasive species are easy to define as pests, but others are not. [Monk\nparakeets](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1190836)\nare an invasive species in the U.S., thought to have been first released by\npet owners either accidentally or as an easy way to get rid of them. The main\nharm they cause is [crop\ndamage](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1191290),\nalthough they [also cause\nfires](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1191661) and\nblackouts by building massive, elevated nests in electrical equipment, and\nthey outcompete indigenous birds. On the other hand, they make cute pets and a\nlot of people like them. This results in a legal mess: the Wild Bird\nConservation Act of 1992 prohibits importing them into the U.S., but [state\nlaws vary\nwildly](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1192256), with\nsome states banning them, while others have no laws whatsoever.\n\nOne of the most useful things a court system does is strike a balance between\npolarities of interest. How should society balance my individual right to play\nloud music with my neighbors' right to peace and quiet? Or my right to run a\ntannery versus my neighbors' right to an unsmelly environment? How should\nsociety balance my individual desire to keep a parakeet as a pet with the\ncommunity's need to minimize the dangers posed by feral birds? Laws that try\nto outlaw legitimate and moral behavior are less likely to succeed.\n\nLaws don't affect every type of defector equally. In addition to those who can\nafford to fight and those who can't, there are three broad types of defectors\nwhen it comes to laws. The first are the individuals who know the law, believe\nthe law is good (or at least that they don't want these things happening to\nthem), and choose to break it anyway: burglars, muggers, kidnappers,\nmurderers, speeders, and people in desperate straits. The second are\nindividuals who know the law, believe the law is wrong, and choose to break\nit: pot smokers, some parakeet and ferret owners, and members of the\nUnderground Railway who helped escaped slaves from the American South flee to\nsafety in Canada. There is also a third category: those who don't know they're\nbreaking the law, or don't realize how their actions affect the group. People\nmight speed because they legitimately didn't see the speed limit sign, or they\nmight not realize that certain sexual practices are against the law. These\nthree groups will react differently to different laws, sanctions, and\nincentives.\n\nSometimes and for some people, laws aren't enough. Sometimes the incentives to\ndefect are worth the risk. That's where security technologies come in.\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nSecurity Systems\n\nSecurity systems are all around us, filling in the gaps where moral,\nreputational, and institutional pressures aren't effective enough. They\ninclude the door locks and burglar alarms in our homes, the anti-\ncounterfeiting technologies in major world currencies, and the system of\nregistering handguns and taking ballistic prints. They can be high-tech, like\nautomatic face recognition systems, or low-tech, like defensive berms and\ncastle walls. They don't even have to be physical systems; they can be\nprocedural systems like neighborhood watches, customs interviews, and police\npat-downs.\n\nTheft of hotel towels isn't high in the hierarchy of world problems, but it\ncan be expensive for hotels. Moral prohibitions against stealing prevent most\npeople from stealing towels. Many hotels put their name or logo on their\ntowels. That works as a reputational pressure system; most people don't want\ntheir friends to see obviously stolen hotel towels in their bathrooms.\nSometimes, though, this has the opposite effect: [making towels\nsouvenirs](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1192859) of\nthe hotel and more desirable to steal. It's against the law to steal hotel\ntowels, of course, but with the exception of large-scale thefts, the crime\nwill never be\nprosecuted.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1009641)\nThe result is that the scope of defection is higher than hotels want. And\nlarge, fluffy towels from better hotels are expensive to replace.\n\nThe only thing left for hotels to do is take security into their own hands.\nOne system that has become increasingly common is to set prices for towels and\nother items, and automatically charge the guest for them if they disappear\nfrom the rooms. This works with things like bathrobes, but it's too easy for\nthe hotel to lose track of how many towels a guest has in his room, especially\nif piles of them are available at the pool or can easily be taken from a\nhousekeeper's cart in the hallway.\n\nA newer system, still not widespread, is to embed washable computer chips into\nthe towels and track their movement around the hotel electronically. One\nanonymous Hawaii hotel claims they've [reduced towel\ntheft](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1193184) from\n4,000 a month to 750, saving $16,000 monthly in replacement costs. Assuming\nthe RFID tags are inexpensive and don't wear out too quickly, that's a pretty\ngood security system.\n\nLet's go back to our two prisoners. They are morally inclined not to betray\neach other. Their reputation in the underworld depends on them not betraying\ntheir fellow criminal. And the criminal organization they're part of has\nunwritten but very real sanctions against betraying other criminals to the\npolice. That's probably enough for most criminals, but not all. And—depending\non the country—the police can be very persuasive.\n\nWhat some organizations do—terrorists and spies come to mind—is add a security\nsystem. They organize themselves in cells so that each member of the criminal\norganization only knows a few other members: the members of his cell and maybe\none or two others. There are a lot of ways to do this, and the organizational\nstructure of the World War II French Resistance wasn't the same as Al Qaeda.\nIf he's arrested or otherwise captured and interrogated, there's only so much\ndamage he can do if he defects. This doesn't help the two captured prisoners,\nof course, but it does protect the rest of the criminal organization.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Criminals testifying against each other.  \n---  \nSociety: The criminal organization.  \nGroup interest: Minimize the amount of jail time for the society. | Competing interest: Minimize personal jail time.  \nGroup norm: Don't testify against each other. | Corresponding defection: Testify against each other in exchange for reduced jail time.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of trust mechanisms.\n\n> > Moral: People feel bad when they let members of their group down.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Those who testify against their fellow criminals are shunned.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: The criminal organization punishes stool pigeons.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: The criminal organization limits the amount of damage a defecting\ncriminal can inflict.  \n  \nOf course, there are some good reasons not to run an organization like this.\nImagine how much less effective a corporate worker would be if he only knew\nthe five people in his department, and only communicated with his supervisor\nusing dead drops and the occasional voice-disguised conversation from\nconstantly changing pay phone locations. But sometimes security wins out over\nclean lines of communication and managerial open-door policies.\n\nIn Chapter 6's [Figure\n8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_014.html#filepos269756), I broke\nout several different types of security systems:\n\n  * Defenses. This is what you normally think of as security: weapons, armor, door locks, bulletproof vests, guard dogs, anti-virus software, speed bumps, bicycle locks, prison walls, panic rooms, chastity belts, and traffic cones. The common aspect of all these things is they try to physically stop potential defectors from doing whatever they're trying to do.\n\n  * Interventions. These are other security measures that happen during the defection that either make defection harder or cooperation easier. To make defection harder, think of obfuscation and misdirection measures, security cameras in casinos, guard patrols, and authentication systems. To make cooperation easier, think of automatic face-recognition systems, uniforms, those automatic road-sign radar guns that tell you what speed you're going, and road signs that inform you of the rules.\n\n  * Detection/response systems. These include burglar alarms, sensors in smokestacks to detect pollutants, RFID tags attached to store merchandise—or hotel towels—and detectors at the doorways, intrusion-detection systems in computer networks, and a UV light to detect if your hotel's bed sheets are clean.\n\n  * Audit/forensic systems. These are primarily enhancements to institutional societal pressure. They include fingerprint- and DNA-matching technology and the expert systems that analyze credit card spending, looking for [patterns of fraud](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1193520).\n\n  * Recovery systems. These are security measures that make it easier for the victim to recover from an attack. Examples are a credit monitoring service or an insurance plan. What's interesting about these measures is that they don't directly influence the risk trade-off. If anything, they make someone more likely to defect, because he can more easily rationalize that the victim won't be hurt by his actions.\n\n  * Preemptive interventions. These operate before the attack, and directly affect the risk trade-off. Think of things like forced castration (chemical or otherwise), mandatory drug therapy to alter the personality of a career criminal, or a frontal lobotomy. Yes, these are often punishments after an attack, but they can prevent a future attack, too. Incarceration is also a pre-emptive intervention as well as a punishment; there are entire categories of crimes that someone in jail simply can't commit. So is execution, for the same reason. Also in this category are [predictive policing programs](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1194987) that increase police presence at times and places where crimes are likely to occur.\n\nI'd be the first to admit this classification isn't perfect, and there are\nprobably examples that don't fit neatly into my different boxes. That's okay;\nI'm less interested in precisely categorizing all possible security\ncountermeasures, and more interested in looking at the breadth of security\nsystems we use every day for societal pressures—many without even realizing\nit.\n\nSecurity systems comprise a unique category of societal pressure. They're the\nlast layer of defense—and the most scalable—against defection. You can view\nthem as a way to technologically enhance natural defenses. Even if humans were\ncomplete loners and had never formed society, never worried about societal\ndilemmas, and never invented societal pressures, security systems could still\nprotect individuals.\n\nAs a technological analog to natural defenses, they're the only societal\npressure that actually puts physical constraints on behavior. Everything else\nwe've discussed so far affects the risk trade-off, either directly, such as\nmoral pressure, or through feedback, such as reputational pressure. Security\ncan work this way as well, but it can also stop someone who decides to defect.\nA burglar might not have any moral qualms about breaking into a jewelry store,\nand he might not be worried about his reputation or getting caught—but he\nwon't be able to steal anything unless he can pick the door lock and open the\nsafe. Security might constrain him technically (the ability to pick the lock),\nfinancially (the cost to buy an oxyacetylene torch capable of cutting open the\nsafe), or temporally (the time required to cut open the safe). Sometimes the\nconstraints are relative, and sometimes they're absolute. This is what makes\nsecurity systems so powerful and scalable. Security systems can work even if a\ndefector doesn't realize that he's defecting. For example, a locked gate will\nstop someone who doesn't realize he's entering private property.\n\nAlso as an analog to natural defenses, security systems aren't always used as\nsocietal pressures. That distinction depends on who implements the security\nsystem and why. Think back to the sealed-bag exchange: the merchant could\nimplement a variety of security systems to prevent his customers from\nshoplifting, cheating, or otherwise defrauding him. He could install security\ncameras and put anti-theft tags on his merchandise. He could buy a device that\ndetects counterfeit money. He could use a service that verifies checks. All of\nthis is the merchant's decision and the merchant's doing, and none of it is\nrelated to intra-group trust.\n\nIf a storeowner installs a camera behind his cash register, it's not societal\npressure; if a city installs cameras on every street corner, it is. And if the\npolice use all the individually installed cameras in the area to track a\nsuspect—as was done with [Timothy McVeigh's\nvan](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1195815)—then\nit's societal pressure. If society decides to subsidize in-store cameras,\nthat's also societal pressure.\n\nIf I carry a gun for self-defense, it's not societal pressure; if we as a\nsociety collectively arm our policemen, it is. You could argue there is no\nsocietal dilemma involved in the hotel's towel-security decision. This is\ncertainly true, and illustrates that the boundary between individual security\nand security as societal pressure can be fuzzy. The same security measure—a\ncamera, for example—might be individual in one instance and societal in\nanother. There are also going to be security measures that are some of both.\nI'm less concerned with the hard-to-classify edge cases than I am with the\ngeneral categories.\n\nEven if a security system is implemented entirely by individuals, that doesn't\nmean it can't also serve as societal pressure. A security camera is more\nlikely to displace crime than reduce it; a potential thief can just go to\nanother store instead. But if enough stores install hidden cameras, potential\nburglars might decide that the overall risk is too great. Lojack, widely\ndeployed, will [reduce car\ntheft](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1196167) (and\nwill increase car theft in neighboring regions that don't have the same\nsystem). Various computer security systems can have a similar result. If a\nsecurity system becomes prevalent enough, potential defectors might go\nelsewhere because the value of defection is reduced.\n\nOf course, society often limits what sort of security systems someone can\nimplement. It may be illegal for a store to install security cameras in\ndressing rooms, even if it would reduce shoplifting. And I'm not allowed to\nbury land mines in my front yard, even if I think it would deter burglars.\n\nOur security systems are also limited by our own abilities. Carrying a gun for\nself-defense makes less sense if you don't know how to use one. And I don't\nhave the time to test every piece of food I eat for poison, even if I wanted\nto. A more realistic example: a store might have a policy to test if large\nbills are counterfeit, but not bother with smaller bills. (Of course,\ndefectors take advantage of this: it's why $20 bills are counterfeited more\noften than $100 bills.)\n\nSecurity systems are both their own category of societal pressure and augment\nthe other three categories, allowing them to scale better. Quite a lot of the\nsocietal pressures we've talked about in the previous three chapters have a\nsecurity component. Examples include:\n\n  * Security-augmented moral pressure. Something as simple as a sign stating “Employees must wash hands after using the restroom” can be viewed as a security system. Measures that make compliance easier are another way to enhance morals, such as the electronic completion and filing of tax returns, photography to put a human face on victims and potential victims, and recycling bins in prominent locations. Other, more modern, technologies directly affect moral societal pressures: psychiatric therapies, personality-altering drugs, and brain-altering surgeries.\n\n  * Security-augmented reputational pressure. The eBay feedback mechanism is a reputational system that requires security to ensure the system can't be hacked and manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. Other examples are letters of introduction, tribal clothing, employee background checks, sex offender databases, diplomas posted on walls, and U.S. State Department travel advisories. Informal online reviews of doctors allow us to trust people we don't know anything about, with our health. Online reputational systems allow us to trust unknown products on Amazon, unknown commenters on Slashdot, and unknown “friends” on Facebook. Credit-rating systems codify reputation. In online games, security systems are less of an enhancement to, and more of a replacement of, moral and reputational pressures for ensuring game fairness.\n\n  * Security-augmented institutional pressure. A community might install cameras to help enforce speed limits. Or a government might use correlation software to analyze millions of tax returns, looking for evidence of cheating. Other examples include alarm systems that summon the police, surveillance systems that allow the police to track suspects, and forensic technologies that help prove guilt. Also time-lock safes, anti-shoplifting tags, cash register tapes, hard-to-forge currency, time cards and time clocks, credit card PIN pads, formal licensing of doctors, and the entire legal profession.\n\nLet's put this all together. Think about an employee traveling for company\nbusiness on an expense account. He can either live frugally, or enjoy the most\nexpensive hotels, restaurants, and so on. It's a societal dilemma:\n\nHere are some more societal dilemmas, and corresponding security systems that\nact as societal pressures.\n\n  * Gridlock. Security measures include traffic cops to keep cars moving, specially striped intersections to demarcate off-limits areas, and cameras to assist enforcement at gridlock-prone intersections.\n\n  * Vaccines. There is ongoing research on how to rebuild public [confidence in vaccines](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1196742) and reduce defection. Tactics could include ad campaigns and other types of marketing. Also, inhalable vaccines make it easier to cooperate.\n\n  * Cheating at games. It's more fun for the group if everyone plays fairly, but it's sometimes more fun for the individual to cheat and win. To help combat cheating, the [new version of Monopoly](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1197155) comes with an electronic gadget that keeps track of everyone's money and makes sure they go to the right square—no cheating.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Corporate expenses.  \n---  \nSociety: The corporation.  \nGroup interest: Minimize corporate expenses. | Competing interest: More enjoyable corporate travel.  \nGroup norm: Spend the corporation's money frugally. | Corresponding defection: Spend a lot on hotel, meals, and so on.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of trust mechanisms.\n\n> > Moral: A company-wide belief that frivolous expenses are tantamount to\n> stealing.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Praising people who save the company money. Publicly\nchastising people who spend lavishly.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Corporate travel policies, including per diem systems and\ndaily spending limits.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: E-mail reminders that people should be parsimonious with the\ncompany's money (enhances moral pressure).\n\n>\n\n>> Requiring employees to submit for approval estimates of how much they'll\nspend beforehand, and making it difficult to get additional expenses\nreimbursed (enhances both moral and reputational pressure).\n\n>\n\n>> Putting everyone's travel expenses on a website that everyone in the\ncompany can see (enhances reputational pressure).\n\n>\n\n>> Requiring booking of airfare and hotels through a dedicated travel agent,\nwho enforces the corporate policies (enhances institutional pressure).\n\n>\n\n>> Auditing of travel expenses, with overspenders being forced to reimburse\nthe company (enhances institutional pressure).  \n  \nA lot of those might not feel like security systems, but they are. The breadth\nof security systems is vast. This chart—from criminal justice professor Ronald\nV. Clarke—illustrates just how diverse security can be.\n\n> ![NumberTable](images/00012.jpg)\n\nIn fact, one way to look at societal pressures is that everything I've written\nabout in these past four chapters is a security system. Morals act as a pre-\nemptive intervention system. Reputation is a detection and response system; so\nare laws and sanctions. Taxes and incentives are interventions. And so on.\nWhile that may be true—and as a security guy that's really how I think of it\nall—it's more useful to think of security as its own thing.\n\nI'm not going to talk more about specific security systems, both because such\ndiscussions can quickly get very technical, and because there are shelves full\nof books already written on the subject.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nThe use of performance-enhancing drugs in professional sports is a societal\ndilemma, and a good example of how security systems fail as a societal\npressure.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1010047)\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Doping in professional sports.  \n---  \nSociety: All the athletes in the sport.  \nGroup interest: A safe and fair sport. | Competing interest: Winning and making a lot of money.  \nGroup norm: Don't take performance-enhancing drugs. | Corresponding defection: Take performance-enhancing drugs.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of trust mechanisms.\n\n> > Moral: Guilt at not winning fair and square. Reminders that athletes are\n> role models, and appeals to “think of the children.”\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Keep fans and endorsements by maintaining the reputation of a\nfair player.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Bans on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Drug testing for specific performance-enhancing drugs.  \n  \nThat's the idea, at\nleast.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1010468) It\nturns out that [enforcing anti-\ndoping](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1198057) rules\nis very difficult. The problem is while the intent of the rules is to ban\nperformance-enhancing drugs in general, the temptation to ignore the group\ninterest and take these drugs is enormous. Here's a quote from professional\ncyclist [Alex\nZülle](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1198370):\n\n> I've been in this business for a long time. I know what goes on. And not\n> just me, everyone knows. The riders, the team leaders, the organizers, the\n> officials, the journalists. As a rider you feel tied into this system. It's\n> like being on the highway. The law says there's a speed limit of 65, but\n> everyone is driving 70 or faster. Why should I be the one who obeys the\n> speed limit? So I had two alternatives: either fit in and go along with the\n> others or go back to being a house painter. And who in my situation would\n> have done that?\n\nBefore the sport started paying attention, distance cyclists used stimulants\nsuch as caffeine, cocaine, nitroglycerine, amphetamines, and painkillers to\nimprove their endurance. It's a classic arms race—everyone had to partake in\norder to keep up—and many athletes suffered catastrophic health effects from\nlong-term use. Morals and reputation aren't going to work in situations like\nthis, and the only effective measures are institutional rules enforced by\nsecurity systems: tests for specific drugs. France passed the first anti-\ndoping laws in 1965; testers found that [almost a\nthird](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1198683) of the\nparticipants in the Tour de France the next year tested positive for\namphetamines. Over the decades, each new potentially performance-enhancing\nsubstance was countered with a ban and then a\ntest.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1010937)\nBlacklists now encompass hundreds of substances.\n\nYet inconsistencies among various regulatory bodies' blacklists have led to\nthe occasional sanction against athletes who [never\nintended](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1199054) to\nbreak the\nrules.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1014271) At\nthe 2000 Olympics, Romanian gymnast Andreea Râducan was [stripped of her gold\nmedal](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1199407)\nbecause she tested positive for pseudoephedrine; she had taken two pills of an\nover-the-counter cold medicine prescribed by her team doctor.\n\nSecurity systems fail for several broad reasons.\n\nThey don't work as well as advertised. Technologies are often developed and\nsold by companies that tout their value, even if there's no real evidence to\nsupport it. So municipalities [install security\ncameras](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1199733) in a\nmistaken belief that they prevent crime, the TSA buys [full-body\nscanners](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1200095) in\na mistaken belief that they prevent terrorism, and the [military spends\nbillions](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1200420) on\nweapons systems like the Sgt. York air defense gun that don't work. In\nprevious centuries, physiognomy (facial features) and phrenology (skull\nmeasurements) were both believed to be useful in identifying criminal\npersonalities.\n\nAttackers develop ways around the technologies. Attackers are always trying to\nfigure out ways around security systems, and some of them succeed. Every anti-\ncounterfeiting measure is eventually successfully overcome by\ncounterfeiters.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1015799)\n(Not just paper money; improvements in metallurgy result in [better\nslugs](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1201043).) No\nmatter how many tax loopholes are closed, there is enough complexity in the\ntax code—and enough legislators willing to slip in provisions to benefit\nspecial interests—that unscrupulous companies can always find more. There are\nmany ways to break the security of [door locks and\nsafes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1201459).\n\nMajor technologies change in ways that affect the security technologies. We'll\ntalk about this extensively in Chapter 16. The Internet has given us an\nendless series of lessons in previously stable systems that failed when they\nmoved online. For example, the security measures against impersonation\nfraud—identity theft—that worked in the world of face-to-face meetings and\ntelephone conversations failed completely with online commerce. Computers make\npaper documents easier to forge, and [fax\nmachines](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1202080)\nmake forgeries easier still. [Electronic voting\nmachines](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1202397) are\nconsiderably less secure than their predecessors. Modern [electronics in\ncars](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1203637) bring\nwith them new security risks. [Networked medical\ndevices](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1204116) can\nbe hacked. There are hundreds of examples like this.\n\nSometimes the technological changes have absolutely nothing to do with the\nsocietal dilemma being secured. Between the ubiquity of keyboards and the\ntendency for teachers to focus on standardized tests, [cursive is not being\ntaught](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1204534) as\nmuch in schools. The result is that signatures are more likely to be either\nprinted text or illegible scrawls, both easier to forge.\n\nSecurity systems that augment other societal pressures, opening new avenues\nfor attack. An example will illustrate.\n\nIn a small town, everyone knows each other, and lenders can make decisions\nabout whom to loan money to, based on reputation (like in the movie It's a\nWonderful Life). The system isn't perfect; there are ways for defectors to\nhide their reputations and cheat lenders. The real problem, though, is that\nthe system doesn't scale. In order to enable lending on a larger scale, we\nenhanced reputation with technological security systems. For instance, credit\nreports and scores are a security-augmented reputational pressure. This system\nworks well, and lending has exploded in our society in part because of it. But\nthe new reputational pressure system can be attacked technologically. A\ndefector could hack the credit bureau's database and enhance her reputation by\nboosting her credit score. Or she could steal someone else's reputation. All\nsorts of attacks that just weren't possible with a wholly personal\nreputational system become possible against a system that works on reputation\nplus a security system.\n\nEven worse, many people don't realize that adding technological security to a\nreputational system makes such a difference, and continue to assume that it's\na wholly reputational system. This adds to the risks. Some examples:\n\n  * Licensing is an institutional—formalized reputational—pressure system. When it is augmented with physical or electronic credentials, forging them becomes a way to attack it.\n\n  * Bank payment systems once had a combination of reputational and institutional pressure systems. Today it's primarily technological, and attackable through that technology.\n\n  * We traditionally used physical cues to assess the reputation of a business: the cleanliness of a restaurant, the impressiveness of a bank's building, and so on. Today we get a lot of those same cues from websites, where they are much easier to fake.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1016476) More generally, our learned abilities to [read trust signals](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1204854) are continually being overtaken by technology.\n\n  * Universal ID systems can make impersonation fraud more profitable, because a single stolen ID can be used in many more places. Sometimes, a [harder-to-forge ID](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1205295) is even riskier, because it is that much more profitable to forge.\n\nThere's a more general change afoot. We're moving a lot of our interactions\nwith other people from evolved social systems into deliberately created socio-\ntechnical systems. Instead of having a conversation face-to-face or voice-to-\nvoice, we have it via text or e-mail. Instead of showing our friends our\nvacation pictures over drinks, we publish them on Flickr. Instead of sharing\nthe intimacies of our life in person, we do it on Facebook. Instead of hanging\nout with our friends in bars or even street corners, we meet in massive multi-\nplayer games with a social component like World of Warcraft and Eve Online.\nThis is an important change. In many of these systems, the technology fades to\nthe background—that's the point, after all—and our brains primarily focus on\nthe social aspects. As a result, we focus on the moral and reputational\npressures endemic to the human interactions and ignore the technological part.\nSo we forget that text conversations can be stored forever, retrieved later,\nand shared with other people. We forget there are people reading our Facebook\ncomments who are not generally privy to the intimacies our life. We forget\nthat Eve Online isn't the same as a face-to-face get-together. The technology\nchanges how our social interactions work, but it's easy to forget that.\n\nIn this way, our traditional intuition of trust and security fails. There's a\nfundamental difference between handing a friend your photo album and allowing\nhim to look through it and giving her access to your Flickr account. In the\nlatter case, you're implicitly giving her permission to make copies of your\nphotos that she can keep forever or give to other people.\n\nOur intuitions about trust are contextual. We meet someone, possibly\nintroduced by a mutual friend, and grow to trust her incrementally and over\ntime. This sort of process happens very differently in online communities, and\nour intuitions aren't necessarily in synch with the new reality. Instead, we\nare often forced to set explicit rules about trust—whom we allow to see posts,\nwhat circles different “friends” are in, whether the whole world can see our\nphotos or only selected people, and so on. Because this is unnatural for\npeople, it's easy to get wrong.\n\nScience is about to give us a completely new way security-augmented\nreputational pressure can fail. In the next ten years, there's going to be an\nexplosion of results in genetic determinism. We are starting to learn which\ngenes are correlated with which traits, and this will almost certainly be\nmisreported and misunderstood. People may use these genetic markers as a form\nof reputation. Who knows how this will fall out—whether we'll live in a world\nlike that of the movie Gattaca, where a person's genes determine his or her\nlife, or a world where this sort of research is banned, or somewhere in-\nbetween. But it's going to be interesting to watch.\n\nI don't mean to imply that it is somehow wrong to use technological security\nsystems to scale societal pressures, or wrong to use security to protect those\ntechnological systems. These systems provide us with enormous value, and our\nsociety couldn't have grown to its present size or complexity without them.\nBut we have to realize that, like any category of societal pressure, security\nsystems are not perfect, and will allow for some scope of defection. We just\nneed to watch our dependence on the various categories of societal pressure,\nand ensure that by scaling one particular system and implementing security to\nprotect it, we don't accidentally make the scope of defection worse.\n\nExpenditures on security systems can outweigh the benefits. Security systems\ncan get very expensive, and there's a point of diminishing returns where you\nspend increasingly more money and effort on security and get less and less\nadditional security in\nreturn.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1016961)\nGiven a choice between a $20 lock and a $50 lock, the more expensive lock will\nprobably be more secure, and in many cases worth the additional cost. A $100\nlock will be even more secure, and might be worth it in some situations. But a\n$500 lock isn't going to be ten times more secure than a $50 lock. There's\ngoing to be a point where the more expensive lock will only be slightly more\nsecure, and not worth the additional cost. There'll also be a point where the\nburglar will ignore the $500 lock and break the $50 window. But even if you\nincrease the security of your windows and everything else in your house,\nthere's a point where you start to get diminishing returns for your security\ndollar.\n\nThe same analysis works more generally. In the ten years since 9/11, the U.S.\nhas [spent about $1\ntrillion](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1205681)\nfighting terrorism. This [doesn't count the\nwars](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1206079) in Iraq\nand Afghanistan, which total well over $3 trillion. For all of that money, we\nhave not increased our security from terrorism proportionally. If we double\nour security budget, we won't reduce our terrorism risk by another 50%. And if\nwe increase the budget by ten times, we won't get anywhere near ten times the\nsecurity. Similarly, if we halve our counterterrorism budget, we won't double\nour risk. There's a point—and it'll be different for every one of us—where\nspending more money isn't worth the risk reduction. A [cost-benefit\nanalysis](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1206454)\ndemonstrates that it's smart to allow a limited amount of criminal activity,\njust as we observed that you can never get to an all-dove population.\n\nThere can be too much security. Even if technologies were close to perfect,\nall they could do would be to raise the cost of defection in general. Note\nthat this cost isn't just money, it's freedom, liberty, individualism, time,\nconvenience, and so on. Too much security system pressure lands you in a\npolice state.\n\nFigure 9: Security's Diminishing Returns\n\n![9](images/00013.jpg)\n\nIt's impossible to have enough security that every person in every\ncircumstance will cooperate rather than defect. Everybody will make an\nindividual risk trade-off. And since these trade-offs are subjective, and\nthere is so much variation in both individuals and individual situations, the\ndefection rate will never get down to zero. We might possibly, in some\nscience-fiction future, raise the cost of defecting in every particular\ncircumstance to be so high that the benefit of cooperating exceeds that of\ndefecting for any rational actor, but we can never raise it high enough to\ndissuade all irrational actors. Crimes of passion, for example, are ones where\nthe cost of the crime far outweighs the benefits, so they occur only when\n[passion overrides\nrationality](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1206820).\n\n\nPart III\n\nThe Real World\n\n\nChapter 11\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nIn a societal dilemma, an individual makes a risk trade-off between the group\ninterest and some competing interest. Until now, we've ignored those competing\ninterests: it's been mostly selfish interests, with the occasional competing\nmoral interest. It's time to fully explore those competing interests.\n\nIn general, there are a variety of competing interests that can cause someone\nto defect and not act according to the group norm:\n\n  * Selfish self-interest. This is the person who cheats, defrauds, steals, and otherwise puts his own selfish interest ahead of the group interest. In extreme cases, he might be a sociopath.\n\n  * Self-preservation interest. Someone who is motivated by self-preservation—fear, for example—is much more likely to behave according to her own interest than to adhere to the group norm. For instance, someone might defect because she's being blackmailed. Or she might have a drug addiction, or heavy debts. Jean Valjean from Les Miserables, stealing food to feed himself and his family, is a very sympathetic defector.\n\n  * Ego-preservation interest. There are a lot of things people do because they want to preserve a vision of who they are as a person. Someone might defect because he believes—rightly or wrongly—that others are already defecting at his expense and he can't stand being seen as a sucker. Broker [Rhonda Breard embezzled](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1207292) $11.4 million from her clients, driven both by greed and the need to appear rich.\n\n  * Other psychological motivations. This is a catch-all category for personal interests that don't fit anywhere else. It includes fears, anxieties, poor impulse control, genuine laziness, and temporary—or permanent—insanity. [Envy can motivate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1207677) deception.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1017783) So can greed or sloth. People do [things out of anger](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1208085) that they wouldn't otherwise do. Some pretty [heinous behavior](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1208630) can result from a chronic deprivation of basic human needs. And there's a lot we're still learning about how people make risk trade-offs, especially in [extreme situations](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1208972).\n\n  * Relational interest. Remaining true to another person is a powerful motivation. Someone might defect from a group in order to protect a friend, relative, lover, or partner.\n\n  * Group interest of another group. It's not uncommon for someone to be in two different groups, and for the groups' interests—and norms—to be in conflict. The person has to decide which group to cooperate with and which to defect from. We'll talk about this extensively later in this chapter.\n\n  * Competing moral interest. A person's individual morals don't always conform to those of the group, and a person might be morally opposed to the group norm; someone might defect because he believes it is the right thing to do. There are two basic categories here: those who consider a particular moral rule valid in general but believe they have some kind of special reason to override it, and those who believe the rule to be invalid per se. Robin Hood is an example of a defector with a competing moral interest. An extreme example of people with a competing moral interest are suicide bombers, who are convinced that their actions are serving some greater good—one paper calls them “[lethal altruists](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1209362).”\n\n  * Ignorance. A person might not even realize he's defecting. He might take something, not knowing it is owned by someone. (This is somewhat of a special case, because the person isn't making a risk trade-off.)\n\nAn individual might have several simultaneous competing interests, some of\nthem pressuring him towards the group norm and some away from it. In 1943,\n[Abraham\nMaslow](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1209780)\nordered human needs in a hierarchy, from the most fundamental to least\nfundamental: physiological needs, safety, love and belonging, self-esteem,\nself-actualization, and self-transcendence. Some of those needs advocate\ncooperation, and others advocate defection.\n\nFiguring out whether to cooperate or defect—and then what norm to follow—means\ntaking all of this into account. I'm not trying to say that people use some\nconscious calculus to decide when to cooperate and when to defect. This sort\nof idea is the basis for the [Rational Choice\nTheory](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1210118) of\neconomics, which holds that people make trade-offs that are somehow optimal.\nTheir decisions are “rational” not in the sense that they are based solely on\nreason or profit maximization, but in the much more narrow sense that they\nminimize costs and maximize benefits, taking risks into account. For example,\na burglar would trade off the prospective benefits of robbing a home against\nthe prospective risks and costs of getting caught. A homeowner would likewise\ntrade off the benefits of a burglar alarm system against the costs—both in\nmoney and in inconvenience—of installing one.\n\nThis mechanistic view of decision making is crumbling in the face of new\npsychological research into the psychology of decision making. It's being\nreplaced by models of what's called [Bounded\nRationality](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1210442),\nwhich provide a much more realistic picture of how people make these sorts of\ndecisions. For example, we know that much of the [trade-off\nprocess](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1211703)\nhappens in the unconscious part of the brain; people decide in their gut and\nthen construct a conscious rationalization for that decision. These gut\ndecisions often have strong biases shaped by evolution, but we know that a lot\nof assessment goes into that gut decision and that there are all sorts of\ncontextual effects.\n\nFigure 10: Competing Interests in a Societal Dilemma\n\n![10](images/00014.jpg)\n\nThis all gets very complicated very quickly. In 1958, psychologist Lawrence\nKohlberg outlined six stages of moral development. Depending on which stage a\nperson is reasoning from, he will make a [different type of trade-\noff](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1212430). The\nstage of moral reasoning won't determine whether a person will cooperate or\ndefect, but instead will determine what moral arguments he is likely to use to\ndecide.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1022121)\n\nMore generally, there are several counterbalancing pressures on a person as\nshe makes her trade-off. We can organize pressures from the person outwards:\nself, kith and kin, less intimate friends, various larger and potentially\noverlapping groups, society as a whole (however we define that), all of\nhumanity (a special case of society as a whole), and some higher moral system\n(religion, political or life philosophy, or whatever). Sometimes the pressures\ncome entirely from a person's own head, as with the various self-interests.\nThe rest of the time, they come from other people or groups.\n\n[Kohlberg's\nStages](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1212784) of\nMorality[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1023005)  \n---  \nLevel 1: Preconventional Morality | Stage 1: Punishment-avoidance and obedience  \nRight and wrong determined by rewards/punishment. | Makes moral decisions strictly on the basis of self-interest. Disobeys rules, if possible without getting caught.  \n| Stage 2: Exchange of favors  \n| Recognizes that others have needs, but makes satisfaction of own needs a\nhigher priority.  \nLevel 2: Conventional Morality | Stage 3: Good boy/good girl  \nOther's views matter. Avoidance of blame; seeking of approval. | Makes decisions on the basis of what will please others. Concerned about maintaining interpersonal relations.  \n| Stage 4: Law and order  \n| Looks to society as a whole for guidelines about behavior. Thinks of rules\nas inflexible, unchangeable.  \nLevel 3: Postconventional Morality | Stage 5: Social contract  \nAbstract notions of justice. Rights of others can override obedience to laws/rules. | Recognizes that rules are social agreements that can be changed when necessary.  \n| Stage 6: Universal ethical principles  \n| Adheres to a small number of abstract principles that transcend specific,\nconcrete rules. Answers to an inner moral compass.  \n  \nThis is important, because the stronger the competing pressure is, the easier\nit becomes to defect from the group interest. Self-preservation interests can\nbe strong, as can relationship interests. Moral interests can be strong in\nsome people and not in others. Psychological motivations like fears and\nphobias can be very strong. The group interests of other groups can also be\nstrong, especially if those groups are smaller and more\nintimate.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1024917)\nScale and emotional distance matters a lot. The diagram gives some feel for\nthis, but—of course—it's very simplistic. Individuals might have different\nemotional distances to different levels, or a different ordering.\n\nFigure 11: Scale of Competing Interests\n\n![11](images/00015.jpg)\n\n[Emily\nDickinson](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1213180)\nwrote that people choose their own society, then “shut the door” on everyone\nelse.\n\nCompeting interests, and therefore competing pressures, can get stronger once\ndefectors start to organize in their own groups. It's one thing for Alice to\nrefuse to cooperate with the police because she believes they're acting\nimmorally. But it's far easier for her to defect once she joins a group of\nactivists who feel the same way. The group provides her with moral arguments\nshe can use to justify their actions, a smaller group she can personally\nidentify with as fellow defectors, advice on how to properly and most\neffectively defect, and emotional support once she decides to defect. And\nscale matters here, too. Social pressures work better in small groups, so it's\nmore likely that the morals of a small group trump those of a larger one than\nthe other way round. In a sense, defectors are organizing in a smaller\nsubgroup where cooperating with them means defecting from the larger group.\n\nDepending on their competing interests, people may be more or less invested in\nthe group norm. The selfish interests tend to come from people who are not\ninvested in the group norm, and competing moral interests can come from people\nwho are strongly invested in the group norm while also strongly invested in\nother norms. Because of these additional investments, they have to explicitly\nwrestle with the corresponding competing interests, and the trade-offs can\nbecome very complicated.\n\nSomeone with criminal tendencies might have a simple risk trade-off to make:\nshould I steal or not? But someone who is both moral and invested in the group\nnorm—Jean Valjean or Robin Hood—has a much harder choice. He has to weigh his\nself-preservation needs, the morality of his actions, the needs of others he's\nhelping, the morality of those he's stealing from, and so on. Of course,\nthere's a lot of individual variation. Some people consider their [morality to\nbe central](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1213470)\nto their self-identity, while others consider it to be more peripheral. René\nGirard uses the term “[spiritual\ngeniuses](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1213937)” to\ndescribe the most moral of people. We also describe many of them as martyrs;\nbeing differently moral can be\ndangerous.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1025261)\nSociety, of course, wants the group interest to prevail.\n\n[Ralph Waldo\nEmerson](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1214347)\nwrote:\n\n> Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better\n> securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and\n> culture of the eater.

Think of the risk trade-off as a balance. When Alice is deciding\nwhether to cooperate or defect, she's weighing the costs and benefits of each\nside. Societal pressures are how the group puts its thumb on the scales and\ntries to make cooperating the more attractive option. If you think Alice is\ndefecting because she's selfish (she's in it for the money) or concerned about\nher ego (she wants to look cool in front of her friends) when she actually has\na competing moral interest, you're going to get societal pressures wrong. The\ndetails are different for every dilemma, but they're almost always important.\n\nThere's another important reason to understand the competing interests: you\nmight get a different type of defection, depending on the competing interest.\nTo illustrate this, let's use a more subtle societal dilemma: whether Alice\nshould cooperate with the\npolice.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1026808)\nThis is important, because whether and to what extent members of society\nreport crime and assist the police greatly influences how well laws against\nthose crimes work. In the absence of 100% automated burglar alarms connected\nto the police station, a monitored security camera in every niche and nook, or\npolice patrols tailing every citizen 24/7, the likelihood that a burglar is\ngoing to get caught depends mostly on the willingness of bystanders to take\naction: either by calling the police, or by tackling the burglar and then\ncalling the police. The more people who report illegal activity—both crimes in\nprogress and crimes after the fact—the better institutional pressure works.\n\nThat's the group interest. Competing interests for not reporting include:\n\n  * Selfish self-interest. Alice might simply not care enough about society to cooperate. She might be too busy with other things in her life, and not have the time to get involved. She might have concluded in a risk–reward calculation that her time and the hassle of reporting a theft outweighs her benefit from reporting it.\n\n  * Self-preservation interest. Alice might be scared to cooperate with the police for any of several reasons. 1) She might be a criminal herself, and would rather not have anything to do with the police. And even though the police often give protection to lesser criminals who help prosecute their more powerful bosses, that protection is irregularly applied, and [there's no guarantee](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1216163) a particular criminal witness will be adequately protected. 2) The police might be a danger to her. It's not universally true that the police are benevolent and helpful. There are people who won't willingly interact with the police out of legitimate fear. 3) She might fear retaliation from the criminals or the criminals' compatriots. Criminal organizations stoke this fear of retribution to allow themselves to commit crimes in a community with relative impunity. There was even a “[Stop Snitching” campaign](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1216541), including a DVD produced by the Baltimore underworld, designed to intimidate people into not reporting crimes.\n\n  * Ego-preserving interest. She might be invested in a self-image that emphasizes keeping one's head down and not borrowing trouble. She might, as a victim, be embarrassed and not want to admit it.\n\n  * Other psychological motivation. She might have an irrational fear of authority figures, severe anxiety, or pathological shyness.\n\n  * Relational interest. She might know the criminal in question, and would rather protect that person than assist the police.\n\n  * Group interest of another group. She might be part of, or sympathetic to, the group committing the crime, and decide to cooperate with the group rather than society as a whole.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1027290) For instance, she might notice her employer committing a crime and decide not to report it. Or she might be a cop watching another cop abusing a prisoner, and she feels loyalty to her fellow officers trumps her moral obligation to report crime.\n\n  * Competing moral interest. She might not believe in the law. Many people in our society would never even think of calling the police when they see an illegal alien (“that law is immoral”), or discover that someone downloads copyrighted music off the Internet (“that law is ridiculous”). She might think the police behave immorally, or that the victim of the crime deserved it.\n\nEven when someone is the victim of a crime, he might choose not to report it.\nExamples include crimes like rape (which can be demeaning to the victim to\nprosecute), some kinds of fraud (which carry a social stigma with them),\nsmall-scale crimes where it is unlikely that the police can help, and\ninstances where the victim has reason to fear the police. Would a prostitute\ncall the police after being raped? When my wife's pocket was picked on the\nBudapest subway a decade ago, we didn't bother reporting it to the police\nbecause we didn't think they could do anything. Internet crimes can fall into\nthis category, too. Quite a bit of credit card fraud isn't reported to the\npolice because the amount is too small for the police to worry about. In fact,\na fraudster can make a good living stealing small amounts of money from large\nnumbers of people because it's not worth anyone's effort to pursue him.\n\nAs a side note, people have lots of reasons for not reporting crime. Sometimes\ncrimes are simply too hard to report. International crimes, made easier by\nglobalization and the Internet, fall into this category. Internet scam victims\nfleeced by criminals in Nigeria probably have no idea whom to call—and the\nunfortunate realization that no one can help. [Con artists\ntry](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1217088) to\nensure that their victims don't call the police, because they thought they\nthemselves did something illegal or because they're too embarrassed at being\nsuckered.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Cooperating with the police.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Effective law enforcement.  \n  \nGroup norm: Cooperate with the police. | Competing interest: Laziness.  \nCompeting norm: Ignore the police.  \nCompeting interest: Self-preservation; that is, a legitimate fear of the\npolice or criminals.  \nCompeting norm: Avoid the police.  \nCompeting interest: Ego-preservation as someone who doesn't get involved in\nothers' affairs.  \nCompeting norm: Don't get involved.  \nCompeting interest: Friend or relative of the person the police are\ninvestigating.  \nCompeting norm: Mislead the police, either actively by lying or passively by\nremaining silent.  \nCompeting interest: Member of a group that opposes the police.  \nCompeting norm: Several possible, depending on the group norm of the group.  \nCompeting interest: Believes that the police are not morally justified in\ntheir actions.  \nCompeting norm: Avoid, obstruct, or mislead the police.  \n  \nNot being aware of the crime is a problem with a lot of Internet fraud. [Fake\nanti-virus\nsoftware](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1217394)\nscams trick users into believing they have a virus, and charge them $25, or\n$50, or more for software to “remove” it. It's a multi-million-dollar\nindustry, and most of the victims never realize they were scammed. There are\n[Internet money\nlaundering](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1217733)\nschemes that work the same way.\n\nCompeting interests are normal, and our society recognizes that people have\nthem. Sometimes we even have mechanisms for dealing with these conflicts of\ninterest. Judges are supposed to recuse themselves from cases in which they\nhave a potential competing interest. Many governments exempt conscientious\nobjectors from compulsory military service. Newspaper columnists, academic\nresearchers, and others are supposed to declare any competing interests so\ntheir readers can understand their biases. Certain laws have religious\nexemptions.\n\nMostly, we're all better off because of these mechanisms: recusal makes it\nless likely that judges will issue decisions that reflect a personal bias;\nconscientious objector status makes it less likely that soldiers will have to\nrely on unwilling comrades to defend them in battle. But public health is not\nbetter off because there are religious exemptions to vaccination laws.\n\nWe even recognize the validity of certain competing interests in the law\nthrough the [doctrine of\nnecessity](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1218083).\nSomething as straightforward as prohibitions against murder have exceptions\nfor things like self-defense, a self-preservation competing interest. But note\nthat the onus is on the person to demonstrate the validity of that competing\ninterest. If Alice shoots and kills Bob, the presumption—and by this I mean\nsocial presumption, not legal presumption—will be that she committed murder,\nunless she can demonstrate otherwise.\n\nAnother point: morals are complicated, and societal dilemmas can disappear\nbecause people don't recognize a particular moral claim and corresponding\ncompeting interest. Overfishing is not a societal dilemma if you're\nunconcerned about the long-term sustainability of the seas. You might not even\nnotice as fishers deplete the oceans, because there will probably still be\nfish in the grocery store as long as you're\nalive.[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1027748)\nSlavery isn't a problem if you don't believe the slave class has the same\nrights as the rest of the community. Even genocide isn't a societal dilemma if\nyou have sufficiently dehumanized those you are slaughtering.\n\nOf course, there's a lot more here that other books cover, and I recommend\nreading the literature on competing morals for some insights into how people\nshould make trade-offs among a variety of [competing\ninterests](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1218466).\nFor our purposes, it's enough to recognize that people have many competing\ninterests, the details of which affect the efficacy of societal pressures as\nwell as the means of defection. And for societal pressures to work, we need\nmechanisms that address the motivation for defection as well as the means.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nWe're all members of many formal and informal groups. These are the societies\nin our societal dilemmas. For most people, humanity is the largest one.\nSociety as a whole—whether we define it as our town, our country, or all of\nhumanity—is a group. The company we work for is a group. Our political party\nis a group. Our city of residence is a group. These groups might have\nsubgroups: the particular department in our company, the particular local\npolitical organization of the national party, our neighborhood in our city.\nExtended families can also be considered groups, and they have lots of\ndifferent subgroups. Large corporations have many levels of subgroups; so do\nmilitaries and some religious groups.\n\nThese groups and subgroups often come into conflict with each other. We\nregularly have to make risk trade-offs in societal dilemmas where the interest\nof one group is in opposition with the interest of another group, and where\ncooperating with one group means defecting from the other, and vice versa. The\nrest of this chapter and the next three chapters discuss group interests and\ncompeting group allegiances. This is essential to understand how cooperation\nand defection work in the real world.\n\nRecall our prisoner, in a societal dilemma with the rest of his criminal\norganization. That's a fine story, but real life is more complicated.\n\nFor the early years of his life, Sean O'Callaghan was a domestic terrorist. He\njoined the Provisional IRA when he was fifteen, and over the next five years,\nparticipated in nearly seventy attacks against the British, including two\nmurders. In 1976, he had a change of heart. For the next ten years, he was a\npolice informant intent on sabotaging the IRA. He thwarted several bombing\nattempts, including one against the Prince and Princess of Wales, and\ndisrupted the delivery of tons of weapons and explosives. He also [publicly\nconfessed](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1218776) to\nhis own crimes, and testified against many other IRA members.\n\n[Defecting from the\nIRA](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1219139) was a\nvery dangerous thing to do. He did so—and risked retribution—because of a\ncompeting moral interest, and also because of another group interest: that of\nhis community. “I realised that there was only one way in which I could help\ndamage the ruthless killing capacity of the IRA: by handing myself up to the\nRUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] and giving evidence against as many people as\npossible.” He was just as much cooperating with the larger group as he was\ndefecting from the smaller group.\n\nO'Callaghan faced a pair of societal dilemmas, both of which we've gone over\nin detail: criminals either cooperating with or defecting from their criminal\norganization and citizens assisting the police. These two societal dilemmas\nwere in conflict. O'Callaghan had to make a choice: cooperate with the IRA and\ndefect from society as a whole, or cooperate with society as a whole and\ndefect from the IRA. The table below just lists the two competing societies\nand ignores the various other competing interests from previous tables.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Cooperating with the police against the IRA.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole. | Competing society: the IRA.  \nGroup interest: A peaceful divided Ireland. | Group norm: Cooperate with the police.  \nCompeting group interest: A free united Ireland, and the well-being of the IRA. | Corresponding group norm: Don't cooperate with the police.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Society teaches people to value peace over freedom and to help\n> convict IRA terrorists.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Society praises people who help the police catch criminals.\nWe give them awards, write articles about them, host them on television shows,\nand so on.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Laws against deliberately withholding evidence from the\npolice, or actively misleading the police.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Hotlines that allow people to report crime anonymously. Witness\nprotection programs.\n\n| To encourage people to act in the competing group interest, the society\nimplements a variety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: IRA teaches people to value freedom over peace and not to let\n> fellow IRA members down.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Those who testify against their fellow criminals are shunned,\nor worse.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: The criminal organization punishes police informants.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: The criminal organization limits the amount of damage a defecting\ncriminal can inflict.  \n  \nCompeting societal dilemmas represent the normal state of affairs. Rarely is\nthe real world so tidy as to isolate a single societal dilemma from everything\nelse. Group interests are often in conflict, and cooperating in one\nnecessitates defecting in another.\n\nNepotism is a problem in many organizations: companies, governments, and so\non.[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1028094) For\nexample, President [Ulysses S.\nGrant](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1219488) found\njobs for many of his relatives. He appointed his brother-in-law as minister to\nDenmark, his cousin as minister to Guatemala. Another brother-in-law was made\ncounsel to Leipzig, and a third became the White House usher.\n\nIt's a pair of societal dilemmas. Grant was a citizen of the United States,\nand bound by its laws and customs. He was also a member of his own family, and\nendeavored to further its interests.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Nepotism  \n---  \nSociety: The organization. | Competing society: The family. (Other competing interests not listed.)  \nGroup interest: Hiring the best people for the job. | Group norm: Not showing any favoritism.  \nCompeting group interest: Making sure your relatives do as well as they can. | Corresponding group norm: Showing favoritism towards relatives.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: It feels good to put the best interests of the organization ahead\n> of personal interests.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: The rest of the organization will react badly to charges of\nnepotism.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Anti-nepotism laws.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: A free press that exposes nepotism.\n\n| To encourage people to act in the competing group interest, the society\nimplements a variety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: It feels good to assist relatives. It's moral to take care of your\n> family.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: The rest of the family will react well to showing favoritism\nand badly to not showing favoritism.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: You might be required to support your unemployed relatives.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: None.  \n  \nOther examples of competing societal dilemmas include:\n\n  * A politician who is a member of a political party and also a resident of the district that elected him.\n\n  * An employee of a department who is also an employee of the whole corporation.\n\n  * A corporate employee who is also a member of a union of workers of that corporation.\n\n  * Someone who is an employee of Company A working as a contractor to Company B. Or, similarly, someone who is an employee of Defense Contractor A working for the military of Country B. Think of employees of private security firms working for the U.S. military in Iraq.\n\n  * A schoolteacher who is both a member of a teacher's union and a parent who sends her children to the school she teaches at.\n\n  * Married lawyers representing opposing parties,[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1029901) or judges related to lawyers appearing before them.\n\n  * Legislators who have worked for companies they write laws to regulate, or who expect jobs with those companies after their legislative careers.\n\n  * Multiple people serving on the boards of directors of the same corporations, known as an [interlocking directorate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1219895).\n\nSome of these competing groups are nested, meaning that the members of the\nsmaller group are all also members of the larger group. Others are\noverlapping, meaning that only some members of each group are also in the\nother group.\n\nMost instances of competing interests are not societal dilemmas, and many are\nnot relevant to security. That voter who lives in one district and votes in\nanother will have to balance her competing interests when voting, but there\nare no security implications. That changes when the members of one group are\nexpected to conform to some norm, and the members of the other group are\nexpected to conform to some conflicting norm.\n\nAnother way to view moral interests is as a group interest. We are all part of\nthe group of “everybody,” whether we define it as society as a whole, the\nhuman race, all life on this planet, or whatever. Many people associate morals\nwith the responsibilities arising from that group membership. Relational\nethicists do this at all scales, but the moral concepts of “universal justice”\nand “human rights” are implicitly connected to membership in the human race.\nPeople differ on what those terms mean, of course.\n\nWhen multiple groups have competing interests, it can feel like a battle to\nsee which group has a stronger tie with the individual. Often it's the\nsmaller, more intimate group. This is by no means definite—people don't\nblindly commit crimes just because their friends are doing so—but it is a\ntendency. In general, it takes more societal pressure to get someone to defect\nfrom a smaller group interest in favor of a larger group interest than it does\nto get someone to do the reverse.\n\nThink of the societal dilemma that someone who is a member of society as a\nwhole and also a member of a criminal gang might have about cooperating with\nthe police. There are benefits to being a member of society, and there are\nalso benefits to being a member of the criminal gang—especially for people who\nlive in dangerous communities in which the police offer little protection, or\neven pose an additional threat. Defecting from the broader society is a whole\nlot easier than defecting from a tight-knit and violent gang. And as long as\nthe criminal gang maintains social ties that are stronger than those of\ngeneral society, members are more likely to cooperate with the gang than with\nsociety in general. This sort of dynamic plays out in organizations as diverse\nas corporations and terrorist organizations. Such organizations want their\nmembers to have a stronger loyalty to them than to society as a whole.\n\nBenefits of group membership are important. In Chapter 12, we'll talk about\ninstances where employees cooperate with their employers in breaking the\nlaw—defecting from society as a whole. It can be hard to go against your boss,\neven when you know that the company's actions are wrong. The benefits of being\npart of the group—things like the reputational approval of your colleagues and\na continued paycheck—are powerful motivators to cooperate with the\norganization.\n\nOver the millennia, we have developed a variety of measures that enhance group\nloyalty: initiation rites, rituals, shared markers of group membership, and so\non. We talked about these in Chapter 8, as societal pressures to ensure\ncommitment. When there are two groups in opposition, these measures become\neven more important.\n\nIt's not just formal organizations. When [Larry Froistad\nconfessed](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1220321) to\nkilling his daughter on an online support group, Lisa DeCarlo alerted the\nauthorities. She was vilified by the other members of the group.\n\n[Police\nsolidarity](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1220747)\nprovides another example. Called the “Blue Wall” or the “Blue Code of\nSilence,” it can be very difficult to get police officers to incriminate each\nother. For example, during the Toronto G20 Summit meeting in 2010, several\nwitnesses reported a [policeman\nbeating](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1221715) a\nprotester. The officer was eventually identified. During the investigation,\nhowever, a pretty good photograph of the then-anonymous policeman was shown to\nhis fellow officers, and no one admitted being able to identify him, including\neight policemen who were in his immediate vicinity during the incident, and\none who was his roommate during the summit.\n\nA huge variety of informal groups can have competing interests in societal\ndilemmas: social groups, ethnic groups, class groups, and racial groups; and\nthere are many societal dilemmas that involve protecting the rights of\nminorities.\n\nFamilies are filled with competing interests. Do you save money for your\nchild's college tuition, or do you help your aging parents with their medical\nexpenses? Do you side with your spouse or your parents? After your parents\ndivorce and one of them remarries, who do you spend holidays with? If you are\nclose friends with both members of a couple and you find out one of them is\nhaving an affair, do you tell or remain silent? When your father's driving\nskills begin to deteriorate, do you take away his car keys? Sometimes security\nis at stake in family situations: if your parents abused you as a child, do\nyou let your children sleep over at their house? In such cases, the societal\npressures are primarily informal: morals and reputation. Only for extreme\ncases of abuse, or very dysfunctional families, is the legal system brought\ninto play.\n\nSince individuals are members of multiple competing groups, there are often\nredundant or conflicting societal pressures operating simultaneously. The\nsocietal pressures for one group don't always transfer to the other, and the\npressures invoked at any time depend on the group that is being secured.\n\nFor example, the rules about what you can do in your family are different from\nthe rules about what you can do out in the real world. We don't call the\npolice if one of our children steals from the other, just as we don't call a\nburglar's parents if we catch him breaking into our house. Sometimes incidents\nof employee misconduct are dealt with by the corporation, but sometimes the\npolice are called in. Groups of nations have their own organizations to call\nupon to deal with rogue nations. It all depends on scale.\n\nWhen the scale changes, it can be confusing to know which rules to follow. We\nsee this in schools, where some teachers and principals have begun calling the\npolice for infractions that they previously would have called parents about.\nThe scale has increased; the rules for dealing with these infractions are more\noften coming from the school district or larger community than from inside the\nclassroom. This means the more informal moral and reputational systems stop\nworking, and teachers feel the need to shift towards an institutional model.\nIn general, as the size of the group grows, more formal societal pressures are\nrequired. And switching scales is messy, because the new systems are\nunfamiliar and often require new ways of thinking, and initially aren't good\nenough to work well.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nIn the next three chapters, we're going to talk about societal dilemmas\nsurrounding organizations: both dilemmas facing groups and dilemmas within the\ngroups. First, we'll talk about organizations in general, and then about\nspecific types of organizations: corporations and (primarily government)\ninstitutions. We're going to see a lot of competing interests and societal\ndilemmas, and some pretty complicated societal pressures.\n\n\nChapter 12\n\nOrganizations\n\nSo far, we've been talking primarily about how societal pressures affect\nindividuals. Organizations—groups as small as several people and as large as\nhundreds of millions of people—also behave as individual actors. These\norganizations can be part of larger groups, just as individuals can, and those\ngroups have group interests and corresponding group norms that affect those\norganizations. And just as Alice has to decide whether or not to steal, break\na contract, or cooperate with the police, so do organizations.\n\nIt can be hard to think about organizations as a collective object. We often\nuse individual metaphors when we talk about groups, and that results in us\ntrying to use our understanding of individuals when we try to understand\ngroups. We say things like “al Qaeda hates America,” “Google is trying to\ncontrol the Internet,” and “China wants a strong dollar” as if those groups\ncould have psychological states. It's metonymy, and while there's value to\nthese generalizations, they also have their hazards. We're going to try to\nnavigate those hazards.\n\nOrganizations are of course made up of individuals, who bring with them the\nsorts of societal dilemmas we've already discussed: both the dilemmas between\nthe organizational interest and the individual's own competing interests, and\nthe societal dilemmas that come from the individual being a member of the\norganization and a member of society as a whole. But we often treat\norganizations as if they actually were individuals, assuming that societal\npressures work on them in the same way they do on individuals. This doesn't\nwork, and results in some pretty bad trust failures, and high scopes of\ndefection.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nOrganizations' competing interests include:\n\n  * Selfish interest. Organizations can have selfish interests, just like individuals. Depending on the organization, it might be profit, power, authority, influence, notoriety, or some combination of those things.\n\n  * Self-preservation interest. Organizations have strong self-preservation interests. They want to survive, just like individuals.\n\n  * Ego-preserving interest. Organizations have an analogue of self-image, and do things to preserve that image. For example, some organizations have a mission statement and go to great lengths to make sure their actions are consistent with their words. (Google's “don't be evil” motto is a good example.) Some organizations have particular reputations they want to preserve, for being honorable, ruthless, quick, and so on. Other organizations take pride in their geographic origins or in how long they've been in business. Still others have charitable foundations.\n\n  * Other psychological motivations. Organizations don't have psychologies, but they do have cultures. Examples are the not-invented-here syndrome, where companies become reluctant to adopt solutions from outside the organization; a “CYA,” or “cover your ass” mentality, which predisposes an organization towards some solutions and away from others; dysfunctional communications, which lead to defection at one level that other levels don't know about; a caste system that can breed resentment in one group and lead to sabotaging behavior; or a skunk works dynamic, where a group inside the organization operates autonomously and in secret for a while.\n\nOrganizations also have competing group interests with other groups: rival\norganizations; groups of organizations, such as industry associations or\ngeographical chambers of commerce; or society as a whole. Multinational\norganizations have potentially competing interests with a variety of\ncountries.\n\nAn example of organizational interest is the March of Dimes. It started out as\nan organization to raise money to fight polio. After the polio vaccine was\ndeveloped and polio almost eradicated, the March of Dimes didn't have a big\nparty and wind up its accounts. Instead, it reconstituted itself as an\norganization to prevent birth defects in general, which should keep it going\nroughly forever.\n\nEven though organizations have interests, the societal pressures we've already\ntalked about work differently on organizations than they do on people.\n\n  * Moral pressure. Organizations are not people; they don't have brains, and they don't have morals. They can have group interests that are analogous to morals, though. Charities can have lofty mission statements, and a corporate mission statement like “don't be evil” is effectively a moral.\n\n  * Reputational pressure. For groups, reputation works differently than for individuals. Organizations care about their reputation just as individuals do: possibly more, due to size. They also have more control over it. Organizations can spend money to repair their reputations by undertaking advertising and public relations campaigns, making over their images, and so on—options that are simply unavailable to most individuals. On the other hand, because organizations are larger, their reputations are more valuable, and can be significantly harmed by the actions of a few of its members.\n\n  * Institutional pressure. Laws can be effective, but organizations cannot have sanctions imposed on them the way people can. They can't be put in jail or executed. In the U.S., there are occasional instances of physical-like punishments to corporations—the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911 comes to mind—and sometimes political parties are outlawed, such as Iraq's Ba'ath party in 2003. In extreme cases, individuals within organizations are jailed in punishment for organizational activity, but those are exceptions. Sometimes organizations are prohibited from certain actions by law as a punishment. For the most part, however, financial penalties are the only sanctions organizations face, which leads to all the issues of financial interests taking precedence over other moral interests we talked about in Chapter 9.\n\n  * Security systems. Security works differently against organizations than it does against people, primarily because they're not people. For the most part, security works against individuals inside the organizations rather than on the organization as a whole.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nOrganizations can be actors in all of the societal dilemmas discussed above.\nThey have to decide whether to cooperate with the police and defraud people\nthey do business with. They are affected by societal pressure. In addition,\nthough, people within organizations have their own societal dilemmas with the\norganizations.\n\nAn example: [Carol Braun\nwas](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1222229)\ndescribed as a “dedicated, dependable, competent and conscientious” 27-year\nemployee of Goodwill Industries of North Central Wisconsin. She must have had\nsome pretty good skills at reputation management, because over seven years,\nshe used her position as comptroller to embezzle more than half a million\ndollars. Her actions were discovered when auditors found a $77,000 discrepancy\nand conducted a comprehensive fraud investigation. Braun pleaded no contest to\na single charge of embezzlement in 2003, and was sentenced to five years in\nprison and another five years of extended supervision. Braun's actions\nresulted not only in significant financial loss to the Wisconsin Goodwill, but\nalso in financial loss to her colleagues, whose pay had to be cut to make up\nthe budget shortfall, and reputational damage to the agency.\n\nThat's a particularly egregious example, but organizations teem with societal\ndilemmas. We often don't notice them because we're intuitively adept at\ndealing with groups of people. We understand hierarchies and authority, and\nthe difference among superiors, colleagues, and subordinates. We're facile at\noffice politics because we've evolved to deal with social groups. But the\nsocietal dilemmas are still there, and sometimes it only takes a little nudge\nto bring them to the surface.\n\nEvery employee of an organization is faced with a societal dilemma: should he\ndo what he wants, or should he do what the organization wants him to do?\nStripped of context, it looks like this:\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Working within an organization.  \n---  \nSociety: The organization.  \nGroup interest: Maximize organizational interest. | Competing interest: Maximize personal interest.  \nGroup norm: Do what the organization tells you to. | Corresponding defection: Do what you want.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Work ethic, pride in a job well done, etc.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: In some organizations, people who are perceived to work\nharder are treated better by their peers. In most organizations, they're\ntreated better by their superiors.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Organizations have all sorts of rules about employee\nbehavior. Employees are supervised. Firing, promotions, and raises are all\ntied to performance—at least in theory.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Time cards, auditing, employee monitoring, formal performance\nreviews, and so on.  \n  \nIn economics, this is known as the principal–agent problem: the principal (in\nthis case the organization) hires an agent (the employee) to pursue the\nprincipal's interests, but because the competing interests of the principal\nand the agent are different, it can be difficult to get the agent to\ncooperate.\n\nDefection isn't all-or-nothing, either. Defections can be as diverse as coming\nin late, not working very hard, venting, whining, passive-aggressive behavior\nwith coworkers, stealing paper clips from the office supply closet, or large-\nscale embezzlement. Remember the employee traveling for business from Chapter\n10. He can cooperate with the organization and limit his expenses, or he can\nput his own self-interest first and spend wildly—or anything in-between.\n\nWe've all had experience with these sorts of defectors. Whether it's company\nemployees, government employees, or members of any type of organization, there\nare always people who simply don't do the job they're supposed to.\n\nThere's another kind of defecting employee: someone who doesn't think of his\nemployer's best interest while doing his job. Think of the officious employee\nwho cares more about the minutiae of his procedures than the job he's actually\nsupposed to do, or the employee who spends more time on office politics than\nactually working. The comic strip Dilbert is all about the dynamics of\ndefecting employees and their defecting managers.\n\nThe fact that organizations almost never stop functioning because of defecting\nemployees is a testament to how well societal pressures work in these\nsituations. Organizations pay their employees, but there's a lot more than\njust salary keeping people doing their jobs. People feel good about what they\ndo. They like being part of a team, and work to maintain their good reputation\nat work. They respond to authority, and generally do what their superiors want\nthem to do. There's also a self-selection process going on; companies tend to\nhire and retain people who set aside their personal interests in favor of\ntheir employer's interests, and individuals tend to apply to work at companies\nthat share their own balance between corporate and personal interests. And if\nthose incentives aren't enough, corporations regularly fire employees who\ndon't do what they're paid to do—or employees quit when they don't like their\nworking conditions. There are also other financial incentives to cooperation\nin the workplace: commissions, profit sharing, stock options, efficiency\nwages, and rewards based on performance.\n\nThe poorer the job is—the less well-paying, the less personally satisfying,\nthe more unpleasant, etc.—the more restrictive the security measures tend to\nbe. Minimum-wage employees are often subject to rigorous supervision, and\npunitive penalties if they defect. Higher-level employees are often given more\nlatitude and autonomy to do their job, which comes with a greater ability to\ndefect.\n\nThis means that the ability to defect, and the stakes of defection, generally\nincrease the higher up someone is within an organization. The overall trade-\noff is probably good for the organization, even though the occasional high-\nranking defecting employee can do more damage before being discovered and\nrealigned or fired than some misbehaving staff on the bottom rung. A senior\nexecutive can modify the organizational interest to be more in line with his\nown. And since he is in charge of implementing societal pressures to ensure\nthat employees act in the organizational group interest, he can design\nsolutions that make employees more likely to cooperate while still leaving him\nroom to defect. He can build in loopholes. Additionally, because he can\nimplement societal pressures to limit defections among the other employees, he\ncan minimize the Bad Apple Effect that would magnify the adverse effects of\nhis defection to the organization. In extreme cases, a CEO can run the company\ninto bankruptcy for his personal profit, a ploy called “[corporate\nlooting](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1223062)” or\n“control fraud.” His power makes it possible for him to impose his personal\nagenda on top of the organizational agenda, so the organization becomes—at\nleast in part—his personal agent.\n\nThis kind of thing doesn't have to be as extreme as fraud. Think of a CEO\nwhose salary depends on the company's stock price on a particular date. That\nCEO can either cooperate with the group interest by doing what's best for the\ncompany, or defect in favor of his self-interest and do whatever is necessary\nto drive the stock price as high as possible on that date—even if it hurts the\ncompany in the long\nrun.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1030336)\n\n[Sambo's\nrestaurants](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1223507)\nhad an odd incentive scheme called “fraction of the action” that let managers\nbuy a 10% interest in individual restaurants: not only the ones they worked\nat, but others as well. This enabled rapid early expansion for the chain,\nsince it both helped finance new openings and gave managers a huge incentive\nto make restaurants prosper. But as the chain grew, people all over the\nhierarchy had individual financial interests that conflicted with their\nloyalty to the chain as a whole. People responsible for getting food to a\nwhole region were able to favor specific restaurants, for instance.\n\nOn the other hand, executives have a lot of societal pressures focused on them\nthat's supposed to limit this sort of behavior. In the U.S., Sarbanes-Oxley\nwas passed precisely for this purpose. And the inherent restraints of their\nroles prevent most of them from being brazen about it. But there are\nexceptions, and some of those are what we read about in the newspapers.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nWe've mentioned organizations as individual actors in societal dilemmas, and\nwe've talked about individuals in societal dilemmas inside organizations. Now\nlet's put them together.\n\nThink back to the overfishing societal dilemma from Chapter 5, but instead of\nFisherman Bob deciding whether to cooperate and limit his catch or defect and\noverfish, it's the Robert Fish Corporation. Fisherman Bob and the Robert Fish\nCorporation face the same societal dilemma, but a corporation isn't actually a\nperson; it's an organization of people in a hierarchy. Let's go through it\nstep by step.\n\nThe Robert Fish Corporation has to decide whether or not to overfish. The\nscale is certainly different than the simpler example—the Robert Fish\nCorporation might have dozens of large fishing boats all over the world—but\nthe idea is the same. The corporation will collect whatever information it\nneeds via its employees, and some person or group within that corporation will\ndecide whether to cooperate or defect. That trade-off will be made based on\nthe corporation's competing interests and whatever societal pressures are in\nplace.\n\nFor the moment, let's assume that the corporation decides to defect. For\nwhatever reason, it is official policy of the Robert Fish Corporation to\nfollow its short-term self-interest at the expense of the group interest of\nsociety as a whole. In this case, that means catching as much fish as\npossible, whenever possible, regardless of whether that depletes the stock.\n\nAlice is the Vice President of Operations of the Robert Fish Corporation. Her\njob is to implement that corporate policy. Alice is in charge of overfishing.\nAs an employee, Alice has a societal dilemma to address. She can either\ncooperate and implement corporate policy to overfish, or defect and undermine\nher employer's goals. But in addition to her role as a Robert Fish Corporation\nemployee, Alice is a member of society as a whole. And as a member of society,\nshe has a second societal dilemma: she can either cooperate and ensure that\nher company fishes responsibly, or defect and allow it to overfish.\n\nThose two societal dilemmas conflict, just like O'Callaghan's two societal\ndilemmas. Cooperating in one means defecting in the other. So when Alice\ndecides whether or not her company is going to overfish, she is caught between\ntwo societal dilemmas. A whole gamut of corporate rules will pressure her to\nimplement corporate policy, and laws against overfishing will pressure in the\nopposite direction.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Overfishing  \n---  \nSociety: The Robert Fish Corporation. | Competing society: Society as a whole. (Other competing interests not listed.)  \nGroup interest: Follow the corporate norms. | Competing group interest: Ensure long-term viability of fishing stocks.  \nGroup norm: Overfish. | Corresponding group norm: Don't overfish.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: It feels good to put the best interests of the organization ahead\n> of personal interests.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: The rest of the organization will react badly to someone who\ndoesn't act in the organizational interest.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Specific corporate overfishing policy regulating behavior.\nRaises and promotions tied to amount of fish caught.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Super-efficient fishing technology that is optimized to maximize\nthe catch.\n\n| To encourage people to act in the competing group interest, the society\nimplements a variety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Good stewardship of earth's resources, being a good global citizen\n> are valorized.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Environmental groups report on company behavior and organize\nletter writing campaigns or boycotts of defectors.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Laws prohibiting overfishing.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Possibly government monitoring of fishing. Pesky protest boats.  \n  \nThere is also the normal gamut of competing interests that Alice might have.\nAlice might be morally predisposed to respect the authority of her bosses and\ngo along with her group. She might believe that overfishing is morally wrong.\nShe probably has some specialized knowledge of the life cycle of fish and the\neffects of overfishing. Concerns about her reputation as a good employee or a\nteam player will make her more likely to cooperate with her employer. Her\nself-regard and her reputation as a moral individual might make her more\nlikely to cooperate with society. Her self-preservation interest—she might be\nfired if she disobeys the corporate policy—comes into play as well. And\nremember that emotional distance is important: if Alice has stronger ties to\nher employer than to society, she's more likely to cooperate with her employer\nand defect from society. Organizations try to keep their employees loyal for\nthis\nreason.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1030912)\n\nClearly Alice has a tough choice to make. Here are some examples of how that\nchoice has played out in the real world. There is a lot of research in\ndecision making within groups, especially corporations. We've already seen in\nChapter 9 how financial considerations dampen moral considerations. There is\nconsiderable evidence, both observational and experimental, that the group\ndynamics of a hierarchical organizational structure, especially a corporate\none, dampen [moral\nconsiderations](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1223907)\nas well. There are [many reasons for\nthis](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1225493), and it\nseems to increase as organizations grow in size.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1982, the [Beech-Nut\nCorporation](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1226232)\nsold millions of bottles labeled as apple juice, intended for babies, that\ncontained no actual apple products. If you read the story of how this\nhappened, and how it kept on happening for so long, you can watch as the\nsenior executives wrestled with their two societal dilemmas. They could\ncooperate with society and not sell phony apple juice, but that would mean\ndefecting from their corporation. Or they could cooperate with their\ncorporation, first by not questioning how this “juice” supplier could be 25%\ncheaper than anyone else, and then by continuing to sell the product even\nafter they knew it was phony; but that would mean defecting from society. In\nthe end, the economic and social ties they had with their company won out over\nany ties with greater society, and it wasn't until an independent laboratory\ndiscovered their deception that they stopped the practice. In 1987, they were\ntried in federal court, and eventually agreed to pay a $2 million fine—at the\ntime, the largest ever paid to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This is\nalso one of the rare occasions that individuals within a corporation were\njailed.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, a growing docket of complaints, criminal prosecutions,\nand civil suits in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere has revealed that,\nsince at least 1950, Roman Catholic bishops knowingly transferred thousands of\npriests accused of child molestation into unsuspecting parishes and dioceses,\nrather than diminish the ranks and reputation of the priesthood and expose the\nchurch to scandal. By 2011, allegations had been made against nearly 5,000\nU.S. priests, and over 15,000 U.S. residents had testified to [being\nvictimized](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1226709).\n(Estimates of the [actual number of\nvictims](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1227003)\nrange as high as 280,000.) In a 2002 tally, approximately two-thirds of\nsitting U.S. bishops were alleged to have either [retained accused\npriests](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1227391) in\ntheir then-current positions or moved them to new assignments. This was in\nkeeping with the [Vatican's\nexhortations](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1227759)\nto investigate cases of sexual abuse in secret, so they would remain bound\nonly by canon law.\n\nWhat happened inside the church can be explained as a pair of societal\ndilemmas. The larger one was within society as a whole: we are definitely all\nbetter off if people don't sexually molest minors, and we have implemented a\nvariety of societal pressures—moral, reputational, and legal—to keep that\nparticular defection down to a minimum. We even have a variety of security\nmechanisms to detect child porn on the Internet and determine who is taking\nand trading those pictures.\n\nMeanwhile, a smaller societal dilemma unfolded within the Roman Catholic\nChurch. Of course pedophilia and ephebophilia aren't the societal norm within\nthe church; pedophile priests are just as much defectors from the church as\nthey are from society as whole. But the church hierarchy (the bishops and the\nVatican) decided that its ability to function as a trustworthy religious\ninstitution depended on reputation. This is known as the “doctrine of\nscandal,” and means that its reputation was more important than justice—or\npreventing further transgressions. So the church systematically worked to keep\nsecret the problem and the identities of the\nperpetrators.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1031313)\nThe church has some pretty strong societal pressures at its disposal—primarily\nmoral and reputational—which is why this scandal took decades to become\npublic. In some cases, it even [forced the\nvictims](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1228633) to\nsign non-disclosure agreements (an institutional pressure).\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Protecting Pedophiles  \n---  \nSociety: The Roman Catholic Church. | Competing society: Society as a whole. (Other competing interests not listed.)  \nGroup interest: A scandal-free church. | Competing group interest: Protecting minors.  \nGroup norm: Protect pedophile priests from exposure and prosecution. | Corresponding group norm: Arrest, convict, and punish pedophiles.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Exposing the church is seen as a sin against it.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Praising people who kept quiet and punishing those who\nexposed the church.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Imposing sanctions against those who exposed the church.\nNon-disclosure agreements.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: None.\n\n| To encourage people to act in the competing group interest, the society\nimplements a variety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Child molestation is bad. Protecting minors, and punishing sex\n> offenders, is paramount in our society.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: People are rewarded, either emotionally or physically, for\nexposing pedophiles. Pedophiles are ostracized.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Laws against pedophilia. Rewards for turning in pedophiles.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Chemical castration, actual castration.  \n  \nIn the end, this backfired massively. Unfortunately, cover-ups are not\nuncommon, as organizations try to protect their own reputation—and their\nprofits from cheaper products. It happens within corporations. It happens\nwithin governments. It can happen within any type of organization.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a new trend that cuts in the opposite direction.\nOne theory of corporate damage control advocates full disclosure,\nacknowledgement, and public displays of contrition, in hopes of a quick\nreputational resurrection. Lots of politicians have been taking this tactic\nwith their tearful public confessions, resignations, treatment center visits,\nand then quick return to public life, problem supposedly solved.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nWhistle-blowers are an extreme example of someone defecting from an\norganization to cooperate with society as a whole. When WorldCom's Vice\nPresident of Internal Audit, Cynthia Cooper, first expressed her concerns\nabout bookkeeping anomalies she had discovered, she was met with hostility\nfrom her supervisor and apathy from the company's auditors. Despite this, she\nunilaterally conducted a full-scale financial audit of the company. What she\ndiscovered was that [top WorldCom\nexecutives](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1229208)\nhad routinely misidentified operating costs as capital expenditures,\nultimately preventing $11 billion from being subtracted from the company's\nbottom line, and thereby misrepresenting the company's value to its board and\ninvestors. Cooper's discovery led to an SEC investigation, bankruptcy and\nreorganization of the company, and criminal convictions of WorldCom's top\nexecutives and accountants. It also brought into renewed focus the need for\npublic companies to implement internal societal pressures to protect\nthemselves and the public from defectors in their ranks.\n\nAlong similar—but not nearly as extreme—lines as Sean O'Callaghan, Cooper put\nherself at considerable personal risk by becoming a police informant.\n\nThis is a complicated risk trade-off, one that includes both the group\ninterests of WorldCom and society as a whole, as well as Cooper's various\nself-interests.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Whistle-blowing  \n---  \nSociety: The organization. | Competing society: Society as a whole. | Other competing interests.  \nGroup interest: The best interest of the organization.  \n  \nGroup norm: Organizational loyalty; do what the organization expects you to do, regardless of competing interests. | Competing group interest: Lawfulness.   \n  \nCompeting group norm: Cooperate with the police and expose organizational wrongdoing. | Competing interest: Keep your job.  \nCompeting norm: Do what the organization wants.  \nCompeting interest: Do what's morally right.  \nCompeting norm: Expose and help prosecute crime.  \nCompeting interest: Don't get involved.  \nCompeting norm: Quit the job and don't say anything.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Acting in the best interest of the organization is “the right thing\n> to do.”\n>\n\n>> Reputational: People who act in the best interest of the organization are\nseen as good and loyal employees.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: People who act in the best interest of the organization are\nrewarded, both financially and with advancement.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Employee monitoring, indoctrination procedures.\n\n| To encourage people to act in the competing group interest, the society\nimplements a variety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Protecting the greater community is “the right thing to do.”\n>\n\n>> Reputational: People who protect the greater community are rewarded with\nthe admiration of the media and the public.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Laws protecting whistle-blowers from retaliation.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Cameras, photocopies, and other recording devices make evidence\ngathering easier.\n\n|  \n  \nI don't know the exact dimensions of the trade-off—likely the full range of\ncompeting interests includes everything related to cooperating with the\npolice—but you get the general idea. And it's not just employees; [corporate\nboard\nmembers](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1230052) face\na similar pair of societal dilemmas. Cooper had a variety of competing\ninterests, and the full force of WorldCom's societal pressures fighting her.\n\nOrganizations can muster considerable societal pressures to prevent and punish\nwhistle-blowing defections. Some extreme examples:\n\n  * National Security Agency [analyst Thomas Drake](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1230447), alarmed by the agency's initiation of warrantless domestic electronic surveillance after the September 11 attacks, first expressed his concerns to his superiors, then supplied classified information on the program to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and oversight committees investigating 9/11-related intelligence failures, and finally shared what he believed was unclassified information about the NSA with a reporter. A year and a half later, federal agents raided Drake's home, confiscated his computers, books, and papers, and accused him of participating in a conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act—a law originally aimed at those who aid the enemy and harm national security, rather than those whose disclosures serve the public interest.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1032063)\n\n  * The [1962 Vatican Instruction](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1231072) “Crimen Sollicitationis” prescribed excommunication of those who violated the oath of secrecy imposed on parties to investigations of sexual misconduct by priests, including pedophilia investigations.\n\n  * As a research physician, Nancy Fern Olivieri was part of a group conducting a clinical trial of a drug for the pharmaceutical company Apotex. When she came to believe that the [drug was ineffective](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1231450) and possibly toxic, Apotex threatened all sorts of legal action against her if she took her concerns public.\n\n  * Detective Jeff Baird exposed misconduct in the New York City Police Department's Internal Affairs division. As a result, he was shunned and harassed by his fellow officers, gratuitously transferred to different units, and received anonymous death threats.\n\nIt's no wonder so few people become whistle-blowers, the consequences can be\nso devastating. Imagine you're in the middle of a Madoff-like pyramid scheme.\nDo you expose the scheme and risk prosecution or retaliation, feign naïveté\nand try to get out, or actively participate for greater rewards and greater\nrisk?\n\nAn even more extreme example is military desertion in wartime. Militaries need\nstrict hierarchies to function effectively. It's important that soldiers obey\nthe orders of their superiors, and be able to give orders to their\nsubordinates. But since these orders might be otherwise pretty abhorrent to\nindividuals, the military implements a lot of societal pressure to make it all\nwork. This is why military training uses substantial social pressures around\nstrict obedience and group cohesion. In addition, militaries have strict rules\nabout obeying orders, with serious sanctions for breaching them. Throughout\nmuch of history, desertion was punishable by death with less than due process,\nbecause it was just too important to the group preservation interest to allow\nfor individual self-preservation.\n\nThis can change when the military is ordered to take action against the very\npeople it believes it is protecting. In 2011, two high-ranking Libyan\n[military pilots\ndefected](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1232567)\nrather than carry out orders to bomb protesters in the Libyan city of\nBenghazi. The pilots realized that they were in a pair of societal dilemmas,\nand chose to cooperate with their fellow countrymen against the government\nrather than cooperate with their fellow soldiers against the protesters.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Military Desertion  \n---  \nSociety: The military. | Competing society: Society as a whole. | Other competing interests.  \nGroup interest: The best interest of the military.  \n  \nGroup norm: Do whatever your superiors tell you to do. | Competing group interest: The best interest of the people in society.   \n  \nCompeting group norm: Don't attack your fellow citizens. | Competing interest: Self-preservation.  \nCompeting norm: Don't put yourself in harm's way.  \nCompeting interest: Ego preservation.  \nCompeting norm: Don't let your fellow soldiers down.  \nCompeting interest: Do what's morally right.  \nCompeting norm: Don't kill people.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the military implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Basic training instills a military morality.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Military units have strong group cohesion.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Disobeying orders is strictly punished.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: A variety of security measures constrain soldiers.\n\n| To encourage people to act in the competing group interest, society\nimplements a variety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Moral teaching not to harm others.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Society ostracizes those who turn against their own people.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Laws against war crimes.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: None.\n\n|  \n  \nIn 2005, Captain Ian Fishback exposed the [U.S.'s use of\ntorture](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1232936) in\nIraq because of his religious convictions. Similarly, Bradley Manning had to\ndeal with two competing societal dilemmas in 2010 when he allegedly became a\nwhistle-blower and sent 250,000 secret State Department cables to the anti-\nsecrecy group WikiLeaks, which made them\npublic.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1033102)\nLike the Libyan pilots, he chose to defect from the government and cooperate\nwith what he perceived as the country as a whole. His subsequent treatment by\nthe U.S. government—which incarcerated him, stripped him of due process, and\ntortured him—is in part a societal pressure by the government to prevent\ncopycat defections. In previous eras, the king might have put his head on a\npike for all to see.\n\nSuch anti-defection measures don't work perfectly, of course. Almost all\ncorporate, government, and other institutional misdeeds become public\neventually. All militaries have some level of insubordination and desertion.\nHistorically, desertion was huge, mostly because there was no good way to\nenforce cooperation most of the time. These days, in most countries, it's\ngenerally kept at a low enough level that it doesn't harm the military\norganization as a whole.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nIt's not always the case that someone who defects from an organization hurts\nthe organization. An individual member of the organization can defect against\nthe desires of the organization but for the benefit of the organization.\n\nThis is easiest to explain with an example. Let's return to the Robert Fish\nCorporation. This time, the corporation decides it will not overfish. Alice, a\nfisher working for the corporation, has a societal dilemma as an employee: she\ncan cooperate and implement the corporate policy, or she can defect and do\nwhat she wants. She also has the same dilemma as a member of society.\n\nLike most employees, Alice generally cooperates and does what the corporation\nwants. The problem is that the corporation wants a lot of things, but only\nmeasures and pays attention to some of them. In our example, Alice's level of\ncooperation is measured by how much her actions affect the profitability of\nthe corporation. She's rewarded for keeping revenues high and costs low, and\npenalized for doing the reverse.\n\nAlice might overfish, even though the official corporate policy is not to. She\ndefects in the societal dilemma with society as a whole, and also in the\nsocietal dilemma with the Robert Fish Corporation. But unless her management\nis specifically measuring her on overfishing, they're not going to realize\nthat her increased revenues are coming from something that is against\ncorporate policy. And unless management penalizes her for doing so, she will\nbe motivated to continue the practice.\n\nThis sort of dynamic is not uncommon in a corporate environment.\n\n  * In 2010, BP's [Deepwater Horizon](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1233256) drilling rig exploded, killing 11 workers and injuring 17 others, then collapsed, and spilled 205 million gallons of oil and 225,000 tons of methane from the Macondo well into the Gulf of Mexico. Reading the reports on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, it's obvious the company cut all sorts of safety corners and took undue risks. The [employees of BP](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1233576) didn't do what was required by law. More importantly, BP's employees didn't do what was required by BP.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1033443)\n\n  * [The “Big Dig,”](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1234195) the massive highway project in downtown Boston from the 1990s, had a long list of defects resulting from shoddy business practices. Again, cutting costs and time was more important than doing the job right on a project already way over time and budget. And while in many cases the companies who did the substandard work were successfully sued, the individuals inside those companies who made the decisions were largely untouched.\n\n  * Before the 2008 financial crisis, there was an expression around Wall Street: “I'll be gone. You'll be gone.” It was what self-interested investment bankers would say about worthless mortgage-backed securities, weird derivatives, or anything else that was more smoke and mirrors than real value. Yes, those who sold these financial instruments were going against the long-term interests of their employer by dealing in them. But by the time anyone would find out, they expected to be rich, retired, and beyond any reprisals from their bosses. It's only a small step removed from pump-and-dump stock scams.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1033878)\n\nThis isn't always a defection from the organization. Sometimes it's a\ndefection in detail but not in spirit. Sometimes senior managers make sure\nthey don't know the details of what's happening. Or they're perfectly aware\ncorners are being cut and regulations violated, but make sure the facts never\nappear in a memo or e-mail. This gives them plausible deniability in the face\nof prosecution. In extreme cases, companies hire public relations people to\nlie to the public without realizing that they're lying. Of course, if someone\ngets caught doing this, the individual will be accused of not following\ncompany policy.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes this is innocent and nothing more than the\norganization's failed societal pressure systems resulting in a too-high scope\nof defection. In either case, in corporations where this sort of thing is\nprone to happen, the individuals who do it are the ones who will most likely\nbe rewarded. So if there are five fishers, and one of them breaks the rules\nand secretly overfishes, she will bring in the most revenue to the company and\nget promoted to manager. The fishers that cooperated and didn't overfish will\nbe passed over. Investment managers who sold the toxic securities were the\nones who got the big bonuses.\n\nSometimes this is incremental. If your colleagues are all overfishing 2%, then\noverfishing 3% isn't a big deal. But then it becomes 5%, 7%, 10%, and so on.\nAs long as the incentive structure rewards doing slightly better than your\ncolleagues, the incentive to defect remains. You get what you reward.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nLarger organizations are naturally nested: departments within corporations,\nagencies within the government, units within a larger military structure,\nstates within a country, and so on. This nested structure regularly leads to\nsocietal dilemmas. They're much like the employee societal dilemmas—should he\nwork hard for the group interest of the company, or slack off for his own\nself-interest—but a subgroup inside the organization is the actor, rather than\nan individual. Should an airport screener act in the best interest of the TSA\nor in the best interest of the federal government? Should an employee act in\nthe best interest of his department, his office, or his company as a whole?\n\nI once worked for a company that had rigid rules about controlling costs.\nThose rules were implemented by department, not company-wide. The idea, of\ncourse, was that cost minimization at the smaller level would translate to\ncost minimization across the entire company. But sometimes it didn't work that\nway. I remember several instances where I had a choice between an action that\nwould cost my department more, and an action that would cost my department\nless but would—because of costs to other departments—cost the company more.\nFor example, I could fly a multi-city itinerary on several more expensive\ntickets, each allocated to the department that was responsible for that\nparticular city. Or I could fly on a single cheaper ticket. Of course, my boss\ntold me to choose the option that cost our department less, because that's how\nhe was rewarded.\n\nThere are other competing interests within organizations: profits, perks (use\nof the corporate jet, for example), the corporate brand, an alternate idea of\nwhat the corporate brand should be, and so on. There are lots of these sorts\nof conflicts of interest in the investment banking world, such as the\n[conflict between\nthe](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1235036) group\nthat takes companies public and the group that recommends stocks to\ninvestors.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1035110)\n[A full\ndiscussion](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1235843)\nof that would take an entire book.\n\n\nChapter 13\n\nCorporations\n\nEverything we discussed in the previous chapter applies to corporations, and\nsome of the examples we used in the previous chapter were corporations. But\nbecause they are actors in so many societal dilemmas—they're legal persons in\nsome countries—they warrant separate discussion. But before examining how\nsocietal dilemmas affect corporations, we need first to understand the basic\nsupply-and-demand mechanics of a market economy as a pair of societal\ndilemmas.\n\nSuppose a local market has a group of sandwich merchants, each of whom needs\nto set a sale price for its sandwiches. A sandwich costs $4 to make, and the\nminimum price a merchant can sell them at and stay in business is $5. At a\nprice of $6 per sandwich, consumers will buy 100 of them—sales equally divided\namongst the merchants. At a sale price of $5 per sandwich, consumers will buy\n150—again, equally divided. If one merchant's prices are lower than the\nothers', the undercutter will get all the business.\n\nThe merchants face a societal dilemma, an Arms Race akin to the advertise-or-\nnot example in Chapter 5. It's in their collective group interest for prices\nto remain high; they collectively make a greater profit if they all charge $6\nfor a sandwich. But by keeping their prices high, each of them runs the risk\nof their competitors acting in their self-interest and undercutting them. And\nsince they can't trust the others not to do that, they all preemptively lower\ntheir prices and all end up selling sandwiches at $5 each. In economics this\nis known as the “race to the bottom.”\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Setting prices.  \n---  \nSociety: All the merchants.  \nGroup interest: Make the most money as a group. | Competing interest: Make the most money individually, and in the short term.  \nGroup norm: Keep prices high. | Corresponding defection: Undercut the competition.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: The group encourages loyalty.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: The group reacts negatively to those who break the cartel.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Various price-fixing schemes.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Internet price-comparison sites.  \n  \nThis societal dilemma is in continuous force. Day after day, month after\nmonth, the merchants are under constant temptation to defect and lower their\nprices, not just down to $5, but even lower, if possible. The end result is\nthat all of them end up selling sandwiches as cheaply as they possibly can, to\nthe benefit of all the customers.\n\nIt's obvious how to solve this: the merchants need to trust each other. Like\nthe mall stores at the beginning of Chapter 9, they can collectively agree to\nsell sandwiches at a minimum price of $6 because they know it benefits them as\na group. This practice was common throughout history. The medieval guild\nsystem was a way for sellers to coerce each other into keeping prices high; it\nwas illegal to engage in trade except through the guild, and the system was\nenforced by the king. Cartels are a more modern form of this; oligopolies are\nanother. Another way is to convince the government to pass a law outlawing\ncheaper sandwiches. Whatever name you use, the [result is price-\nfixing](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1237331).\n\nMerchants like doing this, because keeping prices high is profitable. As [Adam\nSmith](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1307418) said,\n“People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and\ndiversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in\nsome contrivance to raise prices.”\n\nPrice-fixing has had varying degrees of success throughout\nhistory.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1035645)\nSometimes it lasts for a long time. De Beers has successfully controlled the\ndiamond market and kept prices artificially high since the 1880s. And\nsometimes it collapses quickly—the [global citric acid\ncartel](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1237923)\nlasted only four years and the DRAM [computer-memory\ncartel](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1238266) just\nthree. Sometimes buyers, such as Gateway and Dell in the DRAM price-fixing\ncase, have a hand in breaking cartels, but it's usually government. Similarly,\nit's usually government that helps support them. Smuggling and other commerce\noften take place outside the cartel, but the cartel still works as long as\nthey're kept to a minimum.\n\nThat's not good enough for a modern market economy. It is a basic tenet of\ncapitalism that competition—sellers competing for buyers—rather than cartels\nare what should set prices. Capitalist society wants universal defection\namongst sellers, because we recognize that a constant downward pressure on\nprices benefits the economy as a whole.\n\nWhat we realize is that there's another societal dilemma functioning\nsimultaneously and competing with the first.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Setting prices.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Competition. | Competing interest: Make the most money as a group.  \nGroup norm: Do not collude in setting prices. | Competing norm: Keep prices high.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: The belief that price-fixing is wrong and that competition is good.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Being known as the merchant with the lowest price gives you\nan advantage, and being known as a price-fixer makes you look sleazy.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Anti-trust laws.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Various price-comparison websites.  \n  \nEach merchant is in a societal dilemma with all of the other sandwich sellers;\nthey're also in a larger societal dilemma with all the rest of society,\nincluding all the other sandwich sellers. Cooperating in one means defecting\nin the other, and in a modern market economy, the latter dilemma takes\nprecedence.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1036751)\n\nThis works to the buyer's advantage, although more in theory than in practice.\nThe previous societal dilemma pushes prices down only when there are more\nsalable goods than there are buyers, and sellers are competing for buyers.\n\nIn some cases, the buyers can get stuck in a societal dilemma as well, pushing\nprices up. This is the other half of a market economy: buyers competing with\neach other. Imagine that a sandwich seller has twenty sandwiches left, and\nthere are forty people who want to buy one—including customer Bob. The normal\nprice for the sandwich is $5, but the seller has raised his price to $6.\n\nHere's the new societal dilemma. Bob is actually willing to pay $6 for the\nsandwich, but he'd rather get it for $5. So would everyone else. If everyone\ncooperated and refused to pay $6 for a sandwich, the seller would eventually\nbe forced to lower his prices. But there's always the incentive to defect—and\nbe sure of getting a sandwich—rather than cooperate so that everyone who gets\na sandwich pays only $5.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Competing on to-buy prices.  \n---  \nSociety: All the customers.  \nGroup interest: Keep prices low. | Competing interest: Getting the item you want.  \nGroup norm: Don't bid up the price of items. | Corresponding defection: Differing to pay more for an item.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: It's unfair to bid up merchandise.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: There are negative reputational consequences for bidding up\nmerchandise and for overpaying.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: None.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: None.  \n  \nOf course, this kind of thing never happens at sandwich shops. But it\nregularly happens in real estate markets, when buyers bid amounts higher than\nthe asking price in order to out-compete other buyers for properties. It also\nhappens with popular concerts and sporting events, where scalpers create a\nsecondary market with higher prices as more buyers compete for a limited\nnumber of seats.\n\nAuctions are fueled by this societal dilemma. As long as there are more\nbidders who want an item than there are items, they'll compete with each other\nto push prices as high as possible. And auctions implement societal pressures\nto prevent buyer collusion. For example, eBay makes it difficult for buyers to\ncontact each other and collude.\n\nA similar mechanism occurs with clothing in department stores. All department\nstores eventually mark down their seasonal inventory to get rid of it. Selling\nit cheap, or even at a loss, is better than keeping it on the shelves or in a\nstoreroom somewhere. If Alice finds something she wants to buy early in the\nseason, she is faced with a societal dilemma. If she cooperates with everyone\nelse and refuses to buy the clothing at full price, eventually the entire\ninventory will be discounted—drastically. But she risks others defecting and\nbuying the garments at full price, and there not being any left of what she\nwants at the end of the season for the store to discount. Some discount\nretailers such as [Outnet.com](http://Outnet.com) explicitly make use of this\nsocietal dilemma in their sales techniques. A garment starts out at full\nprice, and is discounted more each week, until it reaches a final—very\nlarge—discount. Shoppers are truly faced with a societal dilemma: buy now at\nthe higher price, or wait for a lower price and potentially lose the garment\nto someone\nelse.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1037407) Many\nantique shops and consignment stores use this strategy, too. As long as\nmultiple buyers want the same item, it\nworks.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1037726)\n\nOn the other hand, traditional buying clubs allow buyers to cooperate and push\nprices down. In addition to minimizing distribution and presentation costs,\nCostco and Sam's Club negotiate lower prices on behalf of their members.\n\nBoth of these pairs of societal dilemmas assume that, within each subgroup,\nbuyers, sellers, and sandwiches are interchangeable. But of course that's not\nthe case. Humans are a species of innovators, and we're always looking for\nways to sell more profitable sandwiches and buy cheaper ones. The seller has\ntwo basic options:\n\n  * Merchant Alice can sell a cheaper sandwich. If Merchant Alice can substitute cheaper ingredients or use a cheaper sandwich-making process, she can either sell her sandwiches more cheaply than the competition or sell them at the same price with a greater profit margin—both options making her more money. It might not work. If the customers notice that Alice's sandwiches are of poorer quality than Bob's, they'll value them less. But if the customers don't notice that the sandwiches are any worse, then Alice deserves the increased business. She's figured out a way to make sandwiches cheaper in a way that makes no difference to the customer.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1038399)\n\n  * Merchant Alice can sell a better sandwich. Maybe she finds more expensive but tastier ingredients, or uses a more complicated sandwich-making process. Or she could make the sandwich-buying experience better by serving it with a smile and remembering her regular customers' names. She can either sell that better sandwich at the same price, bringing her more customers and more profit, or she can sell the better sandwiches at a more expensive price—whatever price the customers think those new sandwiches and the premium experience are worth. Of course, this requires that the customers value this better sandwich more. If they do, then Alice also deserves the increased business.\n\nBoth of these things happen all the time. Innovation is one of the important\nthings a market economy fuels. On the buyer's side, the ways for customers to\ninnovate are more limited.\n\nYes, this is all basic supply-and-demand economics; but it's economics from\nthe perspective of societal pressures. You can look at a market economy as two\ndifferent pairs of competing societal dilemmas: one preventing sellers from\ncolluding, and the other preventing buyers from colluding. On a local scale,\nmoral and reputational pressure largely enforces all of this. As long as\nbuyers know the prices sellers are selling at and the sellers know what buyers\nare willing to pay—and this is generally true in local public\nmarkets—competition works as a price-setting mechanism. And if there are\nenough sellers, it's hard for them to collude and fix prices; someone is bound\nto defect and undercut the group. Sellers can try to differentiate their\nproducts from each other—either by selling less-desirable variants at a\ncheaper price or more-desirable variants at a higher price—and buyers will\ncompete against each other to set new prices. The best way to succeed in this\nmarketplace is to offer the best products at the lowest prices: that is, to\nhave the best reputation for quality and price. There need to be enough buyers\nand sellers to make the market fluid, and enough transparency that the buyers\nknow what they're buying; but if those things are true, then it all works.\n\nIt's only when you scale things up that these systems start failing. Societal\npressures don't work the same when the sellers are large corporations as they\ndo when they're sole proprietors in a public market. They don't work the same\nwhen the products are complicated—like cell phone plans—as they do when the\nproducts are simple. They don't work the same when commerce becomes global.\nThey don't work the same when technology allows those corporations to defect\nat a scope larger than their own net worth.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nDuring the early years of Prohibition, there was an epidemic of paralysis in\nthe American South and Midwest, caused by “Jamaica Ginger,” a popular patent\nmedicine. It was mostly\nalcohol,[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1039088)\nbut about 500,000 bottles were laced with what turned out to be a nerve\npoison. It's hard to imagine a reputational pressure system being effective\nenough to prevent this kind of thing from happening. Sure, the company that\nsold this product was vilified, but not before tens of thousands of people\nwere affected. (The “United Victims of [Ginger Paralysis\nAssociation](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1238741)”\nhad 35,000 members.) And, in fact, [this incident\nled](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1239279) to the\npassage of the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the establishment of\nregulations requiring pre-market approval for drugs.\n\nCorporations are organizations. They come in all sizes. The company that made\nall that Jamaican Ginger consisted of two guys and an office; many\ncorporations employ more than 100,000 people; and Wal-Mart employs over\n2,000,000. They have some of the same characteristics as individuals—they try\nto maximize their trade-offs, they have a self-preservation instinct, etc.—but\nthey are not individuals. In some very important ways, they differ from\nindividuals.\n\nThese differences may affect corporations' defection characteristics:\n\n  * They have a single strong self-interest: the profit motive. The case can be made that it's the only relevant interest a corporation has. A corporation is legally required to [follow its charter](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1239676), which for a non-profit corporation means maximizing shareholder value. Individuals have many more competing motivations.\n\n  * They try to hire people who will maximize their selfish interest. The people who run corporations, as well as the people promoted within them, tend to be willing to put the corporation's selfish interest (and sometimes their own selfish interest) ahead of any larger group interest. Individuals can't hire arms and feet selected to meet their needs.\n\n  * They can be very large in several dimensions. They can have a lot of assets, products, sales, stores, and employees. This increases their potential scope of defection: they can defect with greater frequency, and each defection can have greater intensity.\n\n  * They can spread themselves over a large geographical area, so much so that they become unmoored from any physical location. This reduces the effectiveness of institutional pressure that's tied to physical location: laws. It also reduces moral and reputational pressure against senior executives in those corporations, as they can remain socially isolated from those they harm.\n\n  * They can be complex, especially if they're large. This creates more internal subgroups at varying scales and intimacies, and the competing interests within them can change what they do. This gives them more options for evading accountability. It can also make it more difficult for people acting locally to determine what the competing interests actually are. Sometimes a single corporation can encompass different business units that compete directly with each other.\n\n  * They can be powerful. The combination of money and size can make corporations very powerful, both politically and socially. They can influence national and local legislation.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1039399)\n\n  * Millions of people depend on corporations for their livelihood. When a major corporation has problems—or even if it makes strategic decisions about automating, outsourcing, shutting down or starting up new product lines, and so on—many people and their families are affected. Whole communities can be affected. This means there are unintended consequences to many societal pressure systems.\n\n  * They can be difficult to punish. Corporate employees or owners are not the same as the corporation. Also, punishing a corporation can have ripple effects through society, hurting those who were in no way responsible for the corporation's misdoings.\n\n  * They can live forever. They are not tied to their founders, or to any particular people. They can live far longer than human lifespans.\n\n  * They have more to lose than individuals do. A damaged reputation can have much larger effects on corporations than on individuals, especially the big ones. This makes them more conservative.\n\nBecause of these differences, societal pressures work differently. [Moral\npressure is](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1239997)\ndampened in corporations. We've already seen in Chapter 9 that adding\nfinancial incentives tends to trump moral considerations. At the extreme, by\ntelescoping the complexities of human morality into a wholly financial risk\ntrade-off, corporations can largely relieve themselves of moral\nconsiderations. We also saw in Chapter 12 that morals are dampened in\nhierarchical group settings. The research is pretty clear on this point.\n\nThe upshot, to paint with a broad brush, is that corporations' risk trade-offs\nare much more focused on making a financial profit than individuals'\nare.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1039811)\nPeople are emotionally complicated, and will regularly forgo money in exchange\nfor more subjective benefits. Corporations, because of their group nature, are\nsimpler; they are far more likely to choose the more profitable trade-off. To\ntake a familiar example, it's far easier for a chef/owner of a restaurant to\nforgo some profit to create the sort of restaurant that gives him the most\ncreative satisfaction, while a corporate-owned restaurant chain will be more\nconcerned about consistency and the bottom line.\n\nAnother example is a garment or shoe designer buying goods made in [overseas\nsweatshops](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1240826)\nstaffed with child labor. An individual might refuse to do that on moral\ngrounds, recognizing that she is going to have to pay more for those goods\nmade elsewhere and deliberately forgo the extra profits. A corporation is more\nlikely to buy the goods, as long as it's legal to do so. And, as we've seen in\nChapter 12, the person who is in charge of making this decision will do better\npersonally if he ignores his own moral considerations and cooperates with his\nemployer. Even worse, if the corporation doesn't maximize profits, it risks a\nshareholder lawsuit.\n\nAdditionally, market competition encourages sellers to ignore moral pressure\nas much as they can. Imagine if you were in a corporate boardroom, discussing\nthe Double Irish tax loophole and how it could save your company millions.\nAfter it has been explained how the maneuver is perfectly legal, and how other\ncompanies are doing it, how far do you think a “but it's immoral” argument is\ngoing to go? Even if you don't want to do it, if you don't and your\ncompetitors do, you'll be uncompetitive in the marketplace—reminiscent of the\nsports doping example from Chapter 10. Morals have nothing to do with it; this\nis business. Likewise, on a smaller scale, hospitals tend to [replace\nmanagement](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1241388)\nteams who don't exploit Medicare billing loopholes, or engage in illegal\nupcoding, with teams that do.\n\nEven when a corporation engages in seemingly altruistic behavior—investing in\nthe community, engaging in charitable activities, pledging to follow fair\nlabor guidelines, and so on—it is primarily doing so because of the value of\nincreasing its reputation. It's only a bit over the top to call corporations\n“[immortal\nsociopaths](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1241807),”\nas attorney and writer Joel Baken did. For corporations, the closest thing\nthey have to morals is law. The analogy is pretty precise. Morals tell people\nwhat's right and what's wrong; the law tells corporations what's right and\nwhat's wrong. If corporations behave morally, it's generally because they\nbelieve it is [good for their\nreputation](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1242129),\nand to a lesser extent because it's good for employee morale. This is less\nlikely to be true with smaller corporations run by individuals or small groups\nof individuals; there, the corporation is more likely an extension of the\nperson.\n\nOr as [Baron\nThurlow](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1242973), a\nLord Chancellor of England, put it sometime before 1792: “Corporations have\nneither bodies to be punished, nor souls to be condemned, they therefore do as\nthey like.” In more modern language, John Coffee wrote that corporations have\n“[no soul to\ndamn](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1243270); no\nbody to\nkick.”[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1040172)\n\nReputational pressure can also fail against corporations. There's a belief\nthat the market's natural regulation systems are sufficient to provide\nsocietal pressure, and that institutional pressure—laws and regulations—are\nboth unnecessary and have harmful side effects. From the perspective of this\nbook, this is just another name for reputational pressure.\n\nLet's take an example: toxins in bottled water. Assume there's no\ninstitutional pressures, only reputational. Consumers decide for themselves\nwhat sort of toxin levels they are willing to tolerate, and then either buy or\ndon't buy the product. (The assumption here is that removing the toxins costs\nmoney, and will result in a more expensive bottle.) Companies that sell toxin-\nfree water enjoy a good reputation. Companies that allow too much toxin in\ntheir bottled water face a diminished reputation, and as a result, will reduce\nthose toxins in an attempt to repair their reputation. If this works, it\neffectively “regulates” the bottled water companies.\n\nWe already know how reputational pressures fail when arrayed against an\nindividual, and those failures are even more likely in the case of corporate\nreputation.\n\n  * The corporation will try to manage its reputation. Just as a person tries to accentuate his good qualities and minimize his bad ones, corporations do the same. The difference is that corporations will employ people whose entire job is to do this. Corporate reputation management equals public relations, and corporations spend [a lot of money](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1243695) on advertising—$130 billion annually in the U.S. alone. The science of advertising has completely changed over the past couple of decades. Today, it's more like [psychological manipulation](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1244041) with a healthy [dose of neuroscience](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1244353).[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1040748) As such, there can be a large difference between a corporation's behavior and what the public thinks is the corporation's behavior. It can be hard to remember the relative toxicity levels of different bottled water brands when the corporations are all engaged in advertising designed to make you believe you'll be more successful with the opposite sex if you would only drink their product.\n\n  * For reputation to work as a societal pressure system, there needs to be transparency. But consumers might not know enough about the relative toxicity levels to have it affect the reputation of the various companies. (They might not know what chemicals are in the water, they might not know at what concentrations those chemicals are toxic, and they might not know the toxic effects of those chemicals.) Corporations can be very private, especially about things that make them look bad. Sure, testing companies like Consumers Union can give consumers information about the various bottled water companies, but there seems to be very little demand for that sort of thing. Salience matters a lot, here. When you want a bottle of water, you're thinking about your thirst—not about independent third-party evaluations of water quality. To give a real example, corporations have successfully fought the labeling of genetically modified foods, so consumers aren't able to decide for themselves whether to eat them.\n\n  * Corporations might co-opt the testing and rating process. Those “independent third-party evaluations” aren't always so independent, and without transparency, consumers won't know.\n\n  * The damage resulting from the bad behavior might be so severe that no reputational consequences would be enough. Imagine that the bottled water is toxic enough that people start dying. Sure, the company will be out of business. But that seems like an inadequate penalty for killing people. And while this is an extreme story, there are lots of real-world examples of corporate decisions resulting in long-term disease and even death. In 2007 and 2008, at least ten Chinese companies produced contaminated batches of the blood-thinning drug heparin, substituting a cheap synthetic ingredient for a costlier natural one. At least [150 people died](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1245349) as a direct result of the contaminated drug; we may never know how many secondary deaths or related illnesses there were.\n\n  * There can be a long time lag between the bad behavior and the reputational consequences. If the toxin in the bottled water is slow-acting, people might not know about its effects for years or even decades. So a corporation could continue selling toxin-laced water for a long time before it suffered any reputational damage. Remember “I'll be gone, you'll be gone”? That's an economically rational self-interest strategy in that instance.\n\n  * Consumers might not be able to penalize the company that's making the bottled water. In an open-air market, customers know who their suppliers are. In the complex world of international outsourcing and subcontracting, it can be much harder. In 2011, [Cargill recalled](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1245877) 36 million pounds of ground turkey because of salmonella risk. None of that turkey was sold under the Cargill name, making it difficult for customers to penalize Cargill. In 2005, the data broker [ChoicePoint allowed](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1246202) a criminal group to steal the identifying information of 140,000 consumers. If consumers wanted to penalize the company by not doing business with them anymore, they couldn't—consumers aren't ChoicePoint's customers.\n\n  * The profit resulting from the bad behavior might be large enough that it'd be worth the reputational loss. If customers have no choice but to buy the bottled water—maybe there's no competition and the groundwater is even more toxic—then the corporation doesn't have to worry about what customers will think. Less-extreme versions of this scenario happen all the time in the real world; many industries benefit from the difficulty customers have in switching to a competing product.[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1041053)\n\nAll this is made worse by the various substitutes people use in place of\ndirect reputation when it comes to brands. [There's\nrecognition](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1246679):\npeople buy what is familiar to them. [There's social\nproof](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1247083):\npeople buy what others buy. There's even something called [attribute\nsubstitution](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1247498):\npeople buy the red bottle because they like the color red and don't have any\nother way of choosing. These are some of the reasons consumers can be\nmanipulated so easily.\n\nReputation relies on transparency to work, but for many modern products, the\nseller knows a lot more than the buyer. There's a general economic theory\nabout this, called [a lemons\nmarket](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1248032). Both\nexperiment and observation demonstrate that in a lemons market, bad products\ndrive out good products. That is, if one company is selling cheap toxic\nwater—or cheap unhealthy sandwiches—and the buyer doesn't know the difference\nbetween the good products and the cheap ones, he'll buy the cheap ones, and\ncompetitors will be pressured to make their products equally cheap and equally\nbad.\n\nWhat we know about reputational pressures is that they work best in small\ngroups where there are strong social ties among the individuals. A sandwich\nseller in a local public market probably doesn't need a whole lot of\ninstitutional pressure. He's part of a community, and if his sandwiches start\nmaking people sick fast enough that they notice the connection, no one will\nbuy them anymore. But just as this sort of security system doesn't scale for\nindividuals as the community gets larger, social ties weaken, and the value of\nthe items being bought and sold increases, it doesn't scale for corporations,\neither. [Globalization is\nmaking](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1248823) the\neffects of reputational pressure weaker. As a result, the effects of defection\nare greater. Three examples:\n\n  * In 2011, the pharmaceutical giant [Glaxo Smith-Kline](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1249254) was fined $750 million for marketing drugs manufactured in a Puerto Rican plant whose managers ignored numerous FDA letters warning that products were likely contaminated.\n\n  * Hundreds of people in Haiti, Panama, and Nigeria [died of kidney failure](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1249575) in the 1990s and 2000s after consuming medicinal syrups manufactured with toxic diethylene glycol—an industrial chemical used to make plastics. Economically minded manufacturers had secretly substituted the toxic chemical for the more expensive, but nontoxic, glycerin.\n\n  * Starting in the mid-1990s, the Ford Motor Company knew that its Explorer model was [prone to rollover](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1249937), but didn't do anything to fix the problem until 2002. Until they did, there were 185 deaths and 700 injuries resulting from the problem.\n\nJust as moral and reputational pressures can fail against corporations, so can\ninstitutional pressures. We've discussed some of the ways they fail against\nindividuals in Chapter 9: interpretation, loopholes, lack of enforcement.\nThese failures can be more severe in corporations, because corporations can\nafford more and better lawyers to figure out how to evade laws. And law\nenforcement is much more consumer-friendly when it comes to dealing with\nindividual defectors. If someone steals your wallet, you know how to call the\npolice. If a corporation breaks the law, whom do you call?\n\nFines can be an effective institutional penalty, but can fail if they're too\nsmall. The DeCoster family egg farms, responsible for the huge [salmonella\noutbreak](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1250271) in\n2010, had been repeatedly fined for health violations for over ten years. In\n2011, the large pharmaceutical company Merck Serono agreed to pay a $44.5\nmillion fine for illegally marketing [the drug\nRebif](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1250806). That\nsounds like a lot, until you realize that the annual sales of the drug were\n$2.5 billion and the misconduct occurred over an eight-year period. It's no\nwonder the firm was a repeat offender; the fines were just a cost of doing\nbusiness. Another example: the penalties for [using child\nlabor](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1251290) are so\nsmall in some countries—$59 to $147 in Egypt, $470 in India, $70 in Kenya, $47\nto $470 in Nicaragua, $25 to $253 in the Philippines—that it makes financial\nsense for Western companies to defect. In Chapter 11, I mentioned the fake\nanti-virus industry. One company largely ignored the Federal Trade Commission\nprosecution because it was making more money than the fine was likely to\nbe.[12](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1042331)\n\nWe discussed other societal pressure failures inside corporations in the\nprevious chapter: employees of a corporation defecting from that corporation,\nemployee loyalty that encourages cooperation with the corporation and\ndefection from society as a whole, and employees defecting from a corporation\nto benefit that corporation. Additionally, two of the differences between\ncorporations and people listed above—that millions of people depend on them\nfor their livelihood and that punishing them can have ripple effects through\nsociety—mean that sometimes it's in society's best interest to not punish\ndefecting corporations: a fact a smart corporation can use to its advantage.\n\nThere is one more societal pressure failure that is unique to large and\npowerful corporations: the co-option of institutional pressure to further\ntheir own self-interest.\n\nImagine a societal dilemma, one that affects a rich and powerful interest:\nprobably a corporation or an industry, but maybe a person or group of people.\nIt could be the [oil industry\nwanting](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1251680)\ngovernment subsidies (in 2011, the U.S. effectively provided $4.4 billion in\ntax breaks to this industry alone, not even counting the military costs to\nprotect their supply chains); or the Walt Disney Corporation wanting the\ngovernment to extend the period of copyright so Mickey Mouse doesn't fall into\nthe public domain. The group interest is to resolve the dilemma fairly. The\nself-interest for the corporation is to resolve the dilemma in its favor.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Getting public money for projects.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Distribute government money fairly and maintain a level playing field. | Competing interest: Get as much money as you can for your pet projects.  \nGroup norm: Play by the rules. | Corresponding defection: Manipulate the rules.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: It can feel wrong to take too much from the government.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: It can look bad to take too much from the government.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Laws determine what benefits different interests get, and\nprohibit any one interest from taking too much.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: The Congressional Record provides evidence of some of this,\nassuming anyone actually reads it. There are now websites that try to track\npolitical donations.  \n  \nIf a company can convince the government to resolve the dilemma in its favor,\nthen its self-interest becomes the group interest. In this way, companies can\ndefect in spirit by deliberately changing the laws so they are not defecting\nin practice—thereby circumventing or subverting societal pressures. So, for\nexample, companies that make car seats, airbags, full-body scanners, compact\nfluorescent bulbs, car insurance, surveillance cameras, vaccines, radon\ndetectors, and Internet filters for schools have had laws passed mandating—or\nat least encouraging—their use. And the healthcare industry got a [law passed\nlimiting](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1252026) its\nliability for care improperly delayed or denied.\n\nIn a sense, what corporations are doing here is reversing the principal–agent\nrelationship. They're deliberately manipulating institutional pressures so\nthey can directly benefit from them. In economics, changing laws to suit your\ndesires without adding any value is known as rent-seeking.\n\nOne way to manipulate laws is through licensing requirements. Over the past\nseveral years, there have been debates in several states about [licensing\ninterior\ndesigners](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1252750).\nIt's either a necessary measure to keep charlatans out of the busi-ness, or an\nonerous, pro-cartel, anti-competitive system. Another way is through public\nopinion. The political decision not to regulate the derivatives markets is a\ngood example: not only did it involve lobbyists and campaign contributions to\nget laws changed, but also public relations to convince journalists and the\npublic that keeping the markets unregulated was a good idea.\n\nHere's another example. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a means of\nextracting oil and gas from subterranean reservoirs by forcing pressurized\nfluid into underground rock formations. The process was originally\ncommercialized in 1949 and in its first few decades of use was primarily used\nto boost production of old wells. Recent advances in [horizontal drilling\ntechnology](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1253380),\ncombined with hydraulic fracturing, have enabled the tapping of heretofore\ninaccessible reserves, and the recent rise in oil prices has made it\neconomically viable. However, the procedure also poses environmental risks,\nmost notably the risk that chemicals used in the process—including methanol,\nbenzene, and diesel fuel—might contaminate ground water, degrade air quality,\nand migrate to the earth's surface; and that the resultant toxic wastewater\nmight be impossible to\ndecontaminate.[13](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1042914)\nThis societal dilemma sounds a lot like the monk parakeet example from Chapter\n9, and you'd expect society to figure out whether this procedure is worth it.\nBut the companies that use the procedure—Halliburton is a big player\nhere—lobbied successfully for a provision in the 2005 Bush administration\nenergy bill exempting fracking from regulation by the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency under the Safe Drinking Water\nAct.[14](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1043544)\nThat's the effect of reversing the principal–agent relationship: the\ngovernment becomes the agent of the corporation.\n\nOne common way to do this is regulatory capture, which we'll talk about in the\nnext chapter. Another way is to simply be unregulatable for political or\neconomic reasons. Homebuilders have been sued repeatedly over the past decade\nfor [shoddy building\npractices](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1253793),\nmany of them illegal. “Too big to regulate” is how one source put it, making\nit impossible for homeowners to know they're getting a substandard house until\nit's too late. The banking industry is similarly trying very hard to be\nunregulatable, claiming that any regulations would damage the economy more\nthan it would help it.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to organizations, size is proportional to power. Legislative\nbodies used to rule fewer people and smaller geographic areas. In the United\nStates, many laws that were passed by states in the 1800s became federal\nmatters in the 1900s. There's nothing sinister about it; it's just that it now\nmakes more sense to deal with these laws on that scale. Today, international\nlegislative bodies have increasingly more power—simply because more things\nmake sense to deal with on a multinational level.\n\nThis is especially true in corporations. Broadly speaking, there's a natural\nsize of an organization based on the technology of its time. The average\norganization size [used to be\nsmaller](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1254117),\nbecame larger, and now is even larger. Historically, there have only been a\nfew very large organizations: the Roman Empire, the Catholic Church, and so\non. These worked because they were organizations of organizations. That's how\ncountries work; the U.S. has federal, state, and municipal governments. That's\nalso how feudalism, militaries, franchise stores, and large multinational\ncorporations work.\n\nIt still works this way, but we're better at it now. Organizational size is\nrestricted by the limits of moving information around. Different people\nwithin, and different parts of, an organization need to communicate with each\nother; and the larger an organization, the harder that is to do. Most\norganizations are hierarchical, making communications easier. And militaries\nhave generally been examples of the largest-sized organization a particular\ntechnological level can produce. But there's a limit where the costs of\ncommunications outweigh the value of being part of one organization. Economist\n[Ronald Coase\nfirst](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1254649)\npointed this out in 1937. Called “Coase's limit” or “Coase's ceiling,” it's\nthe point of diminishing returns for a company: where adding another person to\nan organization doesn't actually add any value to the organization. You can\nthink of an employee inside of an organization having two parts to his job:\ncoordinating with people inside the organization and doing actual work that\nmakes the company money. Some people are wholly focused inside the\norganization: the HR department, for example. Others do the actual work, but\nstill have internal coordination roles. There's a point where adding an\nadditional person to the organization increases the internal coordination for\neveryone else to a point that's greater than the additional actual work he\ndoes. So, the company actually loses money overall by hiring\nhim.[15](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1043920) The\nease of collecting, moving, compiling, analyzing, and disseminating\ninformation affects Coase's ceiling, and one of the effects of information\ntechnology is that it raises Coase's ceiling because the resultant efficiency\nincreases.[16](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1044273)\n\nLarger size has several effects on societal dilemmas:\n\n  * Large corporations can do more damage by defecting. A single company, Enron, did $11 billion worth of financial damage to the U.S. economy. That much damage might previously have required ten smaller companies to defect. This means that as large corporations grow, fewer defectors can do even more damage. So society needs more security, to further reduce the amount of defection, in order to keep the potential damage constant.\n\n  * Individuals within a large corporation can defect from the corporation to a greater degree, for greater personal gain and to the greater detriment of the corporation. [Nick Leeson's](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1254969) unauthorized trading while he worked for Barings Bank destroyed the entire company in 1995. Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and other senior Enron executives destroyed that company. [Kweku Adoboli](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1255688) lost $2.3 billion for the investment bank UBS in 2011.\n\n  * Large corporations have more power to deliberately manipulate societal pressures. This includes getting laws passed specifically to benefit them, and engaging in jurisdictional arbitrage by deliberately moving certain operations to certain countries in order to take advantage of local laws. [Different countries](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1256153) have different, often conflicting, laws about price-fixing, and international companies have an easier time forming cartels. This sort of thing can be more local, too. Until recently, [Amazon.com used its](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1256812) large national footprint and lack of physical stores to avoid having to charge sales tax in most states.\n\n  * Punishing a large corporation might result in so much cost or damage to society that it makes sense to let them get away with their wrongdoing. The ultimate expression of this is when a company is “too big to fail”: when the government is so afraid of the secondary effects of a company going under that they will bail the company out in order to prevent it.[17](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1045067)\n\n  * Individuals within large corporations can be emotionally further away from the individuals they're affecting when they make decisions about whether to cooperate or defect. Remember that moral pressure decreases in effectiveness with emotional distance. The larger the corporation, the larger the tendency towards emotional distance.\n\n  * Larger corporations have more to lose by defecting. Their reputation is more valuable, and damage to it will have greater effects on the corporation. This serves to restrict what they're willing to do.\n\nLarge corporations can also play one societal dilemma off another. Remember\nour sandwich seller in the market. He's stuck in a societal dilemma with all\nthe other sandwich sellers, and has to set his prices accordingly. In order to\nprevent the market's sandwich sellers from cooperating, society as a whole—as\npart of a larger societal dilemma—passes laws to prevent collusion and price-\nfixing. But a larger sandwich seller has more options. He can expand his\nproduct offering across several dimensions:\n\n  * Economies of scale. He can buy his ingredients in bulk and streamline his production processes.\n\n  * Depth. More sandwich options.\n\n  * Size. Larger or smaller sandwiches.\n\n  * Time. Breakfast sandwiches or sandwiches for midnight snacks.\n\n  * Scope. Sandwich-like things, such as hot dogs, bagels, wraps, and muffins.\n\n  * Accessories. Chips and sodas, groceries.\n\n  * Service. Sandwich subscriptions, delivery, free wi-fi to go along with the sandwiches.\n\nAll this makes it much more difficult to enforce the basic societal dilemmas\nof a market economy. On the face of it, as a seller diversifies, he is now\nstuck in multiple different societal dilemmas: one with the other sandwich\nsellers in the market, and another with—for example—chip sellers. But by tying\nthe two products together, perhaps selling a sandwich and chips together, or\noffering a once-a-week chip subscription with the purchase of a sandwich\nsubscription, he is able to play the two societal dilemmas off each other,\ntaking advantage of both.\n\nWe see this with various product schemes. Whether it's Citibank selling credit\ncards and consumer loans and anti-theft protection plans to go with those\ncredit cards; or Apple selling computer hardware and software; or Verizon\nbundling telephone, cable, and Internet; product bundles and subscription\nservices hide prices and make it harder for customers to make buying\ndecisions. There's also a moral hazard here. The less Citibank spends on\nantifraud measures, the more protection plans it can sell; the higher its\ncredit card interest rates, the more attractive its consumer loans are.\n\nLarge corporations can also use one revenue stream to subsidize another. So a\nbig-box retail store can temporarily lower its prices so far that it's losing\nmoney, in order to drive out competition. Or an airline can do the same with\nairfares in certain markets to kill an upstart competitor.\n\nThings get even more complicated when sellers have multiple revenue streams\nfrom different sources. Apple sells iPhones and iPads to customers, sells the\nability to sell customer apps to app vendors, and sells the right to sell\nphone contracts to phone companies. Magazines sell both subscriptions and\ntheir subscription lists. This sort of thing is taken to the extreme by\ncompanies like Facebook, which don't even charge their users for their apps at\nall, and make all their money selling information about those users to third\nparties.[18](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1045458)\nIt turns out that offering a product or service for [free is very\ndifferent](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1257121)\nthan offering it cheaply, and that “free” perturbs markets in ways no one\nfully understands. The optimal way to do business in an open-air market—offer\nthe best products at the lowest prices—fails when there are other revenue\nstreams available.\n\nAn additional complication arises with products and services that have high\nbarriers to entry; it's hard for competitors to emerge. In an open-air market,\nif the sandwich vendors all sell their sandwiches at too-high prices, someone\nelse can always come in and start selling cheaper sandwiches. This is much\nharder to do with cell phone networks, or computer operating systems, or\nairline tickets, because of the huge upfront costs. And industries can play\nthe meta-game to prevent competition, as when the automobile industry bought\nand then dismantled cities' trolley networks, big agriculture lobbied\ngovernment to impose draconian regulations on small farms, and so on.\n\nThere's one more problem with the technological corporations that doesn't\nreally exist on the small scale of an open-air market: the risks of defection\ncan be greater than the total value of the corporations themselves. An example\nwill serve to explain.\n\n[Chemical\nplants](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1257544) are a\nterrorism risk. Toxins such as phosgene, chlorine, and ammonia could be\ndispersed in a terrorist attack against a chemical plant. And depending on\nwhose numbers you believe, [hundreds of\nplants](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1258008)\nthreaten hundreds of thousands of people and some threaten millions. This\nisn't meant to scare you; there's a lot of debate on how realistic this sort\nof terrorist attack is right now.\n\nIn any case, the question remains of how best to secure chemical plants\nagainst this threat. Normally, we leave the security of something up to its\nowner. The basic idea is that the owner of each chemical plant best\nunderstands the risks, and is the one who loses out if security fails. Any\noutsider—in this case, a regulatory agency—is just going to get it wrong.\n\nAnd chemical plants do have security. They have fences and guards. They have\ncomputer and network security. They have fail-safe mechanisms built into their\noperations.[19](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1046260)\nThere are regulations they have to follow. [The problem\nis](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1258448) that\nmight not be enough. Any rational chemical-plant owner will only secure the\nplant up to its value to him. That is, if the plant is worth $100 million, it\nmakes no sense to spend $200 million on securing it. If the odds of it being\nattacked are less than 1%, it doesn't even make sense to spend $1 million on\nsecuring it. The math is more complicated than this, because you have to\nfactor in such things as the reputational cost of having your name splashed\nall over the media after an incident, but that's the basic idea.\n\nBut to society, the cost of an actual attack could be much, much greater. If a\nterrorist blows up a particularly toxic plant in the middle of a densely\npopulated area, deaths could be in the tens of thousands and damage could be\nin the hundreds of millions. Indirect economic damage could be in the\nbillions. The owner of the chlorine plant would pay none of these costs; to\nhim, they are externalities borne by society as a whole.\n\nSure, the owner could be sued. But he's not at risk for more than the value of\nhis company, and the outcome of a lawsuit is by no means preordained.\nExpensive lawyers can work wonders, courts can be fickle, and the government\ncould step in and bail him out (as it did with airlines after 9/11). And a\nsmart company can often protect itself by spinning off the risky asset in a\nsubsidiary company, or selling it off completely. Mining companies do this all\nthe time.\n\nThe result of all this is that, by leaving the security to the owner, we don't\nget enough of it.\n\nIn general, the person responsible for a risk trade-off will make the trade-\noff that is most beneficial to him. So when society designates an agent to\nmake a risk trade-off on its behest, society has to solve the principal–agent\nproblem and ensure that the agent makes the same trade-off that society would.\nWe'll see how this can fail with government institutions in the next chapter;\nin this case, it's failing with corporations.\n\nThink back to the sandwich sellers in the local market. Merchant Alice is one\nof those sandwich sellers, and a dishonest, unscrupulous one at that. She has\nno moral—or reputational—issues with potentially poisoning her buyers. In\nfact, the only thing that's standing in the way of her doing so is the law.\nAnd she's going to do the math.\n\nShe has the opportunity of making her sandwiches using some substandard but\ncheaper process. Maybe she's buying ingredients that aren't as clean. Whatever\nshe's doing, it's something that saves her money but is undetectable by her\ncustomers.\n\nIf her increased profit for selling potentially poisonous sandwiches is\n$10,000, and the chance of her getting caught and fined is 10%, then any fine\nover $100,000 will keep her cooperating (assuming she's rational and that\nlosing $100,000 matters to her).\n\nNow consider a large sandwich corporation, ALICE Foods. Because ALICE Foods\nsells so many more sandwiches, its increased profit from defecting is\n$1,000,000. With the same 10% probability of penalty, the fine has to be over\n$10,000,000 to keep it from defecting. But there's another issue. ALICE Foods\nonly has $5,000,000 in assets. For it, the maximum possible fine is everything\nthe corporation has. Any penalty greater than $5,000,000 can be treated as\n$5,000,000. So ALICE Foods will rationally defect for any increased profit\ngreater than $500,000, regardless of what the fine is set at (again, assuming\nthe same 10% chance of being fined and no semblance of conscience).\n\nThink of it this way. Suppose ALICE Foods makes $10,000,000 a year, but has a\n5% chance of killing lots of people (or of encountering some other event that\nwould bankrupt the company). Over the long run, this is a guaranteed loss-\nmaking business. But in the short term, management can expect ten years of\nprofit. There is considerable incentive for the CEO to take the risk.\n\nOf course, that incentive is counteracted by any laws that ascribe personal\nliability for those decisions. And the difficulty of doing the math means that\nmany companies won't make these sorts of conscious decisions. But there always\nwill be some defectors that will.\n\nThis problem occurs more frequently as the value of defecting increases with\nrespect to the total value to the company. It's much easier for a large\ncorporation to make many millions of dollars through breaking the law. But as\nlong as the maximum possible penalty to the corporation is bankruptcy, there\nwill be illegal activities that are perfectly rational to undertake as long as\nthe probability of penalty is small\nenough.[20](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1046919)\n\nAny company that is too big to fail—that the government will bail out rather\nthan let fail—is the beneficiary of a free insurance policy underwritten by\ntaxpayers. So while a normal-sized company would evaluate both the costs and\nbenefits of defecting, a too-big-to-fail company knows that someone else will\npick up the costs. This is a moral hazard that radically changes the risk\ntrade-off, and limits the effectiveness of institutional pressure.\n\nOf course, I'm not saying that all corporations will make these calculations\nand do whatever illegal activity is under consideration. There are still both\nmoral and reputational pressures in place that keep both individuals and\ncorporations from defecting. But the increasing power and scale of\ncorporations is making this kind of failure more likely. If you assume that\npenalties are reasonably correlated with damages—and that a company can't buy\ninsurance against this sort of malfeasance—then as companies can do more\ndamaging things, the penalties against doing them become less effective as\nsecurity measures. If a company can adversely affect the health of tens of\nmillions of people, or cause large-scale environmental damage, the harm can\neasily dwarf the total value of the company. In a nutshell, the bigger the\ncorporation, the greater the likelihood it could unleash a massive catastrophe\non society.\n\n\nChapter 14\n\nInstitutions\n\nIn talking about group interests and group norms, I've mostly ignored the\nquestion of who determines the interests, sets the norms, and decides what\nscope of defection is acceptable and how much societal pressure is sufficient.\nIt's easy to say “society decides,” and from a broad enough viewpoint, it\ndoes. Society decides on its pair-bonding norms, and what sorts of societal\nrequirements it needs to enforce them. Society decides how property works, and\nwhat sorts of societal pressures are required to enforce property rights.\nSociety decides what “fair” means, and what the social norms are regarding\ntaking more or doing less than your fair share. These aren't deliberate\ndecisions; they're evolved social decisions. So just as our immune system\n“decides” which pathogens to defend the body against, societies decide what\nthe group norms are and what constitutes defecting behavior. And just as our\nimmune system implements defenses against those pathogens, society implements\nsocietal pressures against what it deems to be defection.\n\nBut many societal pressures are prescribed by those in\npower,[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1047483) and\nwhile the informal group-consensus process I just described might explain most\nmoral and reputational pressure, it certainly doesn't explain institutional\npressure. Throughout most of our history, we have been ruled by\nautocrats—leaders of family groups, of tribes, or of people living in\ngeographical boundaries ranging in size from very small to the Mongol Empire.\nThese individuals had a lot of power—often absolute power—to decide what the\ngroup did. They might not have been able to dictate social norms, but they\ncould make and enforce laws. And very often, those laws were immoral, unfair,\nand harmful to some, or even most, people in the group.\n\nThroughout most of our history, people had no say in the laws that ruled them.\nThose who ruled did so by force, and imposed laws by force. If the monarch in\npower decided that the country went to war, that's what the people did. The\ngroup interest was defined by what the king wanted, and those who ignored it\nand followed some competing interest were punished. It didn't matter if the\nmajority agreed with the king; his word defined the group norm. “L'État, c'est\nmoi” and\nall.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1047814)\n\nI'm eliding a lot of nuance here. Few rulers, from tribal leaders to emperors,\nhad—or have—absolute power. They had councils of elders, powerful nobles,\nmilitary generals, or other interests they had to appease in order to stay in\npower. They were limited by their roles and constrained by the societies they\nlived in. Sometimes a charismatic and powerful ruler could radically change\nsociety, but more often he was ruled by society just as much as he ruled it.\nSometimes group norms are decided by privileged classes in society, or famous\nand influential people, or subgroups that happen to be in the right place at\nthe right time.\n\nIn parts of our history, laws and policy were decided not by one person but by\na cohort: the ancient Roman Senate, the Maggior Consiglio in medieval Venice,\nthe British Parliament since the Magna Carta. Modern constitutional\ndemocracies take this even further, giving everybody—more or less—the right to\ndecide who rules them, and under what rules those rulers rule.\n\nThis dynamic isn't limited to government; it also plays out in other groups.\nSomeone in charge decides what the group's norms are, constrained by the\n“rules” of his office. A CEO can be removed from office by the board of\ndirectors. A Mafia head can be deposed by a rival; criminal gangs and\nterrorist groups have their own organizational structures.\n\nThe deciders generally don't decide the details of the norms and societal\npressures. For example, while the king might decide that the country will go\nto war and all able-bodied men are to be drafted into the army, he won't\ndecide what sorts of security measures will be put in place to limit\ndefectors. Society delegates the implementation of societal pressures to some\nsubgroup of society. Generally these are institutions, which I'll broadly\ndefine as an organization delegated with implementing societal pressure. We've\nalready discussed delegation and the principal–agent problem. We're now going\nto look at how that plays out with institutions.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nIn 2010, [full-body\nscanners](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_030.html#filepos1200095)\nwere rushed into airports following the underwear bomber's failed attempt to\nblow himself up along with an airplane. There are a lot of reasons why the\ndevices shouldn't be used, most notably because they can't directly detect the\nparticular explosive [the underwear\nbomber](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1259793) used,\nand probably wouldn't have detected his underwear bomb. There have been\nseveral court cases brought by people objecting to their use. One of them,\nfiled by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, alleged the TSA didn't\neven follow its own rules when it fielded the devices. (Full disclosure: I was\na plaintiff in that case.) I want to highlight an argument a Department of\nHomeland Security lawyer made in federal court. He contended that the agency\nhas the legal authority to [strip-search\nevery](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1260494) air\ntraveler, and that a mandatory strip-search rule could be instituted without\nany public comment or rulemaking. That is, he claimed that DHS was in charge\nof airline security in the U.S., and it could do anything—anything—it wanted\nto in that name.\n\nAfter the [September 11\nattacks](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1261160),\npeople became much more scared of airplane terrorism. The data didn't back up\ntheir increased fears—airplane terrorism was actually a much larger risk in\nthe 1980s—but 9/11 was a huge emotional event and it really knocked people's\nfeeling of security out of whack. So society, in the form of the government,\ntried to improve airport security. George W. Bush signed the Aviation and\nTransportation Security Act on November 19, 2001, creating the Transportation\nSecurity Administration.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Airplane terrorism.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Safe air travel. | Competing interest: Blowing up airplanes is believed to be an effective way to make a political point or advance a political agenda.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1048323)  \nGroup norm: Not to blow up airplanes. | Corresponding defection: Blow up airplanes.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, society implements these\nsocietal pressures:\n\n> > Moral: Our moral systems hold that murdering people and destroying\n> property is wrong.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Society punishes people who kill innocents, and even people\nwho espouse doing that. In some cases, people are publicly vilified not\nbecause they themselves advocate violence, but because they aren't\nsufficiently critical of those who do.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Nation states implement laws to fight airplane terrorism,\nincluding invasive passenger screening. We have severe punitive measures to\ndeter terrorists, at least the non-suicide kind.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Magnetometers, x-ray machines, swabs fed into machines that\ndetect potential explosives, full-body scanners, shoe scanners, no-fly lists,\nbehavioral profiling, and on and on.  \n  \nThe societal dilemma of airplane terrorism is a particularly dangerous one,\nbecause even a small number of defectors can cause thousands of deaths and\nbillions of dollars in economic damage. People are legitimately concerned\nabout this, and want strong societal\npressures.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1048982)\nMoral and reputational pressures aren't nearly enough, both because the [scale\nis too large](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1261542)\nand the competing group interest is so strong. Institutional pressure is\nrequired, and the institution in the U.S. that has been delegated with this\nresponsibility is the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nThere are actually several levels of delegation going on. The people delegate\nsecurity to their leaders—Congress and the president—who delegate to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security, which delegates to the TSA, which delegates\nto individual TSA agents staffing security checkpoints.\n\nFigure 12 illustrates how institutional pressure is delegated. Ultimately,\ninstitutions are put in charge of enforcement. These aren't always\ngovernments; they can be any subgroup of society given the power to enforce\ninstitutional pressure at any level, such as:\n\n  * The police, who implement societal pressures against a broad array of competing norms. (Okay, I admit it. That's an odd way to describe arresting people who commit crimes against people and property.)\n\n  * The judicial system, which 1) punishes criminals and provides deterrence against future defections, and 2) adjudicates civil disputes, providing societal pressures based on both formal and informal societal norms.\n\n  * Government regulatory agencies, such as the U.S.'s TSA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n  * Industry organizations, which implement industry self-regulation. (This is often agreed to in order to forestall government regulation.)\n\n  * Corporate security offices, which implement the physical and data-security policies of a corporation.\n\n  * Corporate auditors, who 1) verify the same, and 2) verify the corporation's books, providing societal pressures against corporate financial malfeasance.\n\n  * An independent security company, hired by an organization to guard its buildings.\n\nFigure 12: How Societal Pressures Are Delegated\n\n![12](images/00016.jpg)\n\nThe goal of delegation is for the institution to act as the group's agent.\nThat is, to implement societal pressures on behalf of, and in the name of, the\ngroup. But because of the principal–agent problem, that institution doesn't\nhave the same competing interests as the group as a whole—or even as any\ninstitution or subgroup above them. As a result, it won't necessarily\nimplement societal pressures to the same degree or in the same way as the\ngroup would like. And that's an endless source of problems.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to terrorism and airplane security, those problems are legion.\nThe TSA is a government institution with a mandate and funding from the U.S.\ngovernment. It answers to the government. And the government has a mandate\nfrom, is funded by, and answers to, the people. Given all of that, you'd\nexpect the people to have a lot of input into what the TSA does. Which is why\nit can seem so weird when it does things with absolutely no input from anyone.\nBut it's a natural effect of the principal–agent problem.\n\nThe TSA's interests aren't the same as those of any of the groups it's an\nagent for: DHS, the government, or society as a whole.\n\nFor one, the TSA has a self-preservation interest. If it is seen as\nunnecessary—that is, if society as a whole believes there's a sufficiently\ndiminished terrorist threat—it might be disbanded. Or perhaps its function\nwould be taken over by some international security organization. In either\ncase, like a person, the TSA is concerned about its own survival. (By the way,\npeople working within the TSA are also concerned about their jobs, power, and\nreputation within the agency, and so on.)\n\nFor another, the TSA is concerned with its own reputation in the eyes of\nsociety. Yes, it wants to do a good job, but it also needs to be seen as doing\na good job. If there's a terrorist attack, the TSA doesn't want to be blamed\nfor not stopping the terrorists. So if a terrorist bombs a shopping mall\ninstead of an airplane, it's a win for the TSA, even though the death toll\nmight be the\nsame.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1049753) Even\nwithout an actual terrorist attack, if it is seen as doing a bad job—even if\nit's actually doing a good job—it will be penalized with less public support,\nless funding, and less\npower.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1050080)\n\nFinally, the TSA is concerned about its relative power within the government.\nThe more funding it has, and the closer it is to the president, the better job\nit can do and the more likely it is to survive.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Implementing airplane security.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \n| Competing interest: Selfish interest—garner as much power and prestige as it\ncan.  \n| Corresponding defection: Get as much money for its budget as possible.  \nGroup interest: Airplane security whose benefits exceeds the costs. | Competing interest: Self-preservation—ensure that it won't be disbanded by the government.  \nGroup norm: Implement airplane security at a reasonable level. | Corresponding defection: Become an indispensable part of airplane security.  \n| Competing interest: ego preservation - ensure that if there is a terrorist\nattack, it won't be blamed.  \n| Corresponding defection: implement a greater level of airplane security than\nthe risk trade-off warrants.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, society implements these\nsocietal pressures:\n\n> > Moral: We teach people to do the right thing.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Institutions that put their own survival ahead of their\nnominal missions aren't thought of very well.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Legislators and courts rein institutions in.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Auditors, inspectors, cameras, and monitoring.  \n  \nThe TSA's competing interests are common in government agencies. You can see\nit with the police and other law-enforcement bodies. These institutions have\nbeen delegated responsibility for implementing institutional pressure on\nbehalf of society as a whole, but because their interests are different, they\nend up implementing security at a greater or lesser level than society would\nhave.\n\nExaggerating the threat, and oversecuring—or at least overspending—as a result\nof that exaggeration, is by far the most common outcome. The TSA, for\ninstance, would never suggest returning airport security to pre-9/11 levels\nand giving the rest of its budget back so it could be spent on broader anti-\nterrorism measures that might make more sense, such as intelligence,\ninvestigation, and emergency response. It's a solution that goes against the\ninterests of the TSA as an institution.\n\nThis dynamic is hardly limited to government institutions. For example,\ncorporate security officers exhibit the same behavior. In Chapter 10, I\ndescribed the problem of corporate travel expenses, and explained that many\nlarge corporations implement societal pressures to ensure employee compliance.\nThis generally involves approval—either beforehand for things like airfare and\nhotels, or after-the-fact verification of receipts and auditing—of travel\nexpenses. To do this, the corporation delegates approval authority to some\ndepartment or group of people, which determines what sort of pressures to\nimplement. That group's motivation becomes some combination of keeping\ncorporate travel expenses down and justifying its own existence as a\ndepartment within the corporation, so it overspends.\n\nRecall the professional athletes engaging in an arms race with drug testers.\nIt might be in the athletes' group interest for the sport of cycling to be\ndrug-free, but the actual implementation of that ideal is in the hands of the\nsport's regulatory bodies. The World Anti-Doping Agency takes the attitude of\n“ban everything, the hell with the consequences.” It might better serve the\nathletes if the agency took more time and spent more money developing more\naccurate tests, was more transparent about its testing methodology, and had a\nstraightforward redress procedure for athletes falsely accused—but it's not\nmotivated to make that risk trade-off. And as long as it's in charge, it's\ngoing to do things its way.\n\nEnforcing institutions have a number of other competing interests resulting\nfrom delegation. A common one has to do with how the enforcing institutions\nare measured and judged. We delegate to the police the enforcement of law, but\nindividual policemen get reviewed and promoted based on their arrest and\nconviction rate. This can result in a variety of policing problems, including\na police department's willingness to pursue an innocent person if it believes\nit can get a conviction, and pushing for an easy conviction on a lesser charge\nrather than a harder conviction on a more accurate charge.\n\nThere's one competing interest that's unique to enforcing institutions, and\nthat's the interest of the group the institution is supposed to watch over. If\na government agency exists only because of the industry, then it is in its\nself-preservation interest to keep that industry flourishing. And unless\nthere's some other career path, pretty much everyone with the expertise\nnecessary to become a regulator will be either a former or future employee of\nthe industry, with the obvious implicit and explicit conflicts. As a result,\nthere is a tendency for institutions delegated with regulating a particular\nindustry to start advocating the commercial and special interests of that\nindustry. This is known as [regulatory\ncapture](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1261999), and\nthere are many examples both in the U.S. and in other countries. U.S. examples\ninclude:\n\n  * The Minerals Management Service, whose former managers saw nothing wrong with [steering contracts to](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1262900) ex-colleagues embarking on start-up private ventures, and having sexual relationships with and accepting gifts from oil and gas industry employees. In fact, the MMS was broken up in 2010 because this cozy relationship was blamed in part for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\n  * The [Federal Aviation Administration](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1263457), whose managers' willingness to overlook or delay action on crucial safety problems contributed to the 1996 crash of a ValuJet Airlines DC-9 in the Everglades, and the 2011 sudden in-flight failure of a section of fuselage on a Southwest Airlines 737.\n\n  * The [Securities and Exchange](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1264299) Commission, whose lawyers routinely move to government employment from the banking industry, and back after their term of service is over. One of the effects of this revolving door was a poorly regulated banking industry that caused the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nOne way to think about all this is as a battle between diffuse interests and\nconcentrated interests. If you assume that specific regulations are a trade-\noff between costs and benefits, a regulatory institution will attempt to\nstrike a balance. On one side is the industry, which is both powerful and very\nmotivated to influence the regulators. On the other side is everyone else,\neach of whom has many different concerns as they go about their day and none\nof whom are particularly motivated to try to influence the regulators. In this\nway, even if the interests of society as a whole are greater than the\ninterests of the industry, they're not as well-represented because they're so\ndiffuse. And to the extent that the institution is society's agent for\nimplementing societal pressures, this becomes a colossal failure of societal\ninterest. Moreover, each level of delegation introduces new competing\ninterests, like a horribly conflicted game of telephone.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nInstitutions have power, and with that power comes the ability to defect.\nThroughout history, governments have acted in the self-interest of their\nrulers and not in the best interest of society. They can establish social\nnorms and enforce those norms through laws and punishment. They can do this\nwith or without the support of the people.\n\nBut there's a new type of potentially defecting institution, one that's made\npossible by the information age: corporations acting in the role of\ninstitutions. This can happen whenever public infrastructure moves into\nprivate hands. With the rise of the Internet as a communications system, and\nsocial networking sites in particular, corporations have become the designers,\ncontrollers, and arbiters of our social infrastructure. As such, they are\nassuming the role of institutions even though they really aren't. We talked in\nChapter 10 about how combining reputational pressure with security systems\ngives defectors new avenues for bypassing societal pressures, like posting\nfake reviews on Yelp. Another effect is that the corporation that designs and\nowns the security mechanisms can facilitate defection at a much higher level.\n\nLike an autocratic government, the company can set societal norms, determine\nwhat it means to cooperate, and enforce cooperation through the options on its\nsite. It can take away legal and socially acceptable rights simply by not\nallowing them: think of how publishers have eroded fair use rights for music\nby not enabling copying options on digital players. And when the users of the\nsite are not customers of the corporation, the competing interests are even\nstronger.\n\nTake Facebook as an example. Facebook gets to decide what privacy options\nusers have. It can allow users to keep certain things private if they want,\nand it can deny users the ability to keep other things private. It can grant\nusers the ability to fine-tune their privacy settings, or it can only give\nusers all-or-nothing options. It can make certain options easy to find and\neasy to use, and can make other options hard to find and even harder to use.\nAnd it will do or not do all of these things based on its business model of\nselling user information to other companies for marketing purposes. Facebook\nis the institution implicitly delegated by its users to implement societal\npressures, but because it is a for-profit corporation and not a true agent for\nits users, it defects from society and acts in its own self-interest,\neffectively reversing the principal–agent relationship. Of course, users can\nrefuse to participate in Facebook. But as Facebook and other social networking\nsites become embedded in our culture and our socialization, opting out becomes\nless of a realistic option. As long as the users either have no choice or\ndon't care, it can act against its users' interests with impunity.\n\nIt's not easy to implement societal pressures against institutions that put\ntheir competing interests ahead of the group interest. Like any other\norganization, institutions don't respond to moral pressure in the same way\nindividuals do. They can become impervious to reputational pressure. Since\npeople are often forced to interact with institutions, it often doesn't matter\nwhat people think of them. Yes, in a democracy, people can vote for\nlegislators who will better delegate societal pressures to these institutions,\nbut this is a slow and indirect process. You could decide to not use a credit\ncard or a cell phone and therefore not do business with the companies that\nprovide them, but often that's not a realistic alternative.\n\nSometimes the authorities are just plain unwilling to punish defecting\ninstitutions. No one in the U.S. government is interested in taking the\nNational Security Agency to task for [illegally\nspying](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1265101) on\nAmerican citizens (spy agencies make bad enemies). Or in punishing anyone for\n[authorizing the\ntorture](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1266169)\nof—often innocent—terrorist suspects. Similarly, there's little questioning\nlegislatively about President Obama's self-claimed [right to\nassassinate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1266888)\nAmericans abroad without due process.\n\nThe most effective societal pressures against institutions are themselves\ninstitutional. An example is the lawsuit I talked about at the start of this\nchapter. EPIC sued the TSA over full-body scanners, claiming the agency didn't\neven follow its own rules when it fielded the devices. And while the [court\nrejected\nEPIC's](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1267225)\nFourth Amendment arguments and allowed the TSA to keep screening, it ordered\nthe TSA to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking. Not a complete victory by\nany means, but a partial one.\n\nAnd there are many examples of government institutions being reined in by the\ncourt system. In the U.S., this includes judicial review, desegregating\nschools, legalizing abortion, striking down laws prohibiting interracial and\nnow same-sex couples from marrying, establishing judicial oversight for\nwiretapping, and punishing trust fund mismanagement at the Bureau of Indian\nAffairs.\n\nWhat's important here is accountability. It is important that these mechanisms\nare seen publicly, and that people are held accountable. If we're going to\nkeep government from overstepping its bounds, it will be through separation of\npowers: checks and balances. But it's not just government that needs to be\nwatched; it's corporations, non-government institutions, and individuals. It's\neveryone's responsibility to keep everyone else in check.\n\n\nPart IV\n\nConclusions\n\n\nChapter 15\n\nHow Societal Pressures Fail\n\nLet's start our discussion of societal pressure failures with an example:\ntaxes. Paying taxes is a classic free-rider problem; if almost everyone\ncooperates by paying taxes, defectors get all the benefits of whatever those\ntaxes are paying for without having to suffer the financial penalties of\nactually\npaying.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1050572)\nThere are laws and enforcement, but at least in the U.S., with the exception\nof payroll taxes, income tax is almost entirely enforced by voluntary\ncompliance. It's not just a financial risk trade-off; there are two pieces of\nmoral pressure at work here: [people paying\ntaxes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1267885)\nbecause it's the right thing to do, and people paying taxes because it's the\nlaw and following the law is the right thing to do.\n\nStill, there's [a lot of\nfraud](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1268260) in the\nU.S. According to the IRS, in 2001—the most recent year I could find\ncomprehensive numbers for—the difference between total taxes owed and total\ntaxes paid was $345 billion; about 19% of the total taxes due. A [third-party\nestimate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1268594)\nfrom 2008 tax returns also showed a 19% tax gap. Note that this gap is in the\npercentage of money owed, not the percentage of cheaters. By one estimate, 25%\nof individuals admit to [cheating on their\ntaxes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1269034). On\nthe other hand, a single corporation avoiding billions in taxes costs\ntaxpayers vastly more money than many thousands of waiters lying about their\ntip income.\n\nThere are many [reasons people\ncheat](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1269414) on\ntheir taxes, and they all point to failures of societal pressure. First, there\nis [very little\nenforcement](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1269771).\nIn 2007, for example, the [IRS examined\nless](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1270083) than 1%\nof the 179 million tax returns filed, initiated criminal prosecutions in only\n4,211 cases, and obtained indictments in only 2,322 cases. [Corporate audits\nare down](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1270365),\ntoo, both in number and thoroughness. And while there's debate about whether\n[increasing the\npenalties](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1270703)\nagainst tax evaders increases compliance, we do know that increasing the\nnumber of audits [increases\ncompliance](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1271174)\nand—of course—collects more of the taxes owed. Aside from low-level cheating\nthat can be easily detected by computer matching, cheating on your taxes is\neasy and you're not likely to get caught.\n\n[Second, it's\nprofitable](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1271582).\nThese days, if you're making a 5% return on your investments, you're doing\nreally well. With the top federal tax rate at 35%, the money you can save by\ncheating is a pretty strong motivation. These are not people who can't afford\nto pay taxes; the typical tax cheat is a male under 50 in a high tax bracket\nand with a complex return. (Poorer users, with all their income covered by\npayroll taxes, have less opportunity to cheat.) The current situation creates\nan incentive to cheat.\n\nThird, people think that lots of other people do it. Remember the Bad Apple\nEffect? There's a 1998 survey showing people believe that 38% of their fellow\ntaxpayers are [failing to\ndeclare](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1271941) all\ntheir income and listing false deductions. And the high-profile tax cheats\nthat make the news reinforce this belief.\n\nAnd fourth, recent political rhetoric has [demonized\ntaxes](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1272298). Cries\nthat taxation equals theft, that the tax system is unfair, and that the\ngovernment just wastes any money you give it gives people a different\nmorality, which they use to justify underpayment. This weakens the original\nmoral pressure to pay up.\n\nAll of [these reasons\ninteract](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1272610)\nwith each other. One study looked at tax evasion over about 50 years, and\nfound that it increases with income tax rates, the unemployment rate, and\npublic dissatisfaction with government. Another [blamed income\ninequality](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1273063).\n\nDespite all of this, the U.S. government collects 81% of all taxes owed.\nThat's actually pretty impressive compared to some countries.\n\nThere's another aspect to this. In addition to illegal tax evasion, there's\nwhat's called tax avoidance: technically legal measures to reduce taxes that\nrun contrary to the tax code's policy goals. We discussed tax loopholes at\nlength in Chapter 9. There are a lot of creative companies figuring out ways\nto follow the letter of the tax law while completely ignoring the spirit. This\nis how companies can make billions in profits yet pay little in taxes. And\nmake no mistake, industries, professions, and groups of wealthy people\ndeliberately manipulate the legislative system by lobbying Congress to get\nspecial tax exemptions to benefit themselves. One example is the [carried-\ninterest tax](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1273467)\nloophole: the taxation of private equity fund and hedge fund manager\ncompensation at the 15% long-term capital gains tax rate rather than as\nregular income. Another is the [investment tax\ncredit](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1273928),\nintended to help building contractors, that people used to subsidize expensive\nSUVs. There's also tax flight—companies moving profits out of the country to\nreduce taxes.\n\nEstimates of lost federal revenue due to legal tax avoidance and tax flight\nare about $1 trillion. Adding tax evasion, the total amount of lost revenue is\n$1.5 trillion, or 41% of total taxes that should be collected. Collecting\nthese taxes would more than eliminate the federal deficit.\n\nOkay, so maybe that's not so good.\n\nThere are a lot of societal pressure failures in all of this. Morals differ:\npeople tend to perceive tax evasion negatively, tax flight—companies moving\nprofits out of the country to reduce taxes—neutrally, and tax avoidance\npositively: it's legal and clever. Even so, a reasonable case can be made that\ntax avoidance is just as immoral as tax evasion. The reputational effects of\nbeing a public tax cheat are few, and can be positive towards people who are\nclever enough to find legal loopholes. Institutional pressure depends on\nenforcement, which is spotty. Security systems are ineffective against the\nmore complex fraud.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nRemember the goal of societal pressures. We want a high level of trust in\nsociety. Society is too complex for the intimate form of trust—we have to\ninteract with too many people to know all of their intentions—so we're\nsettling for cooperation and compliance. In order for people to cooperate,\nthey need to believe that almost everyone else will cooperate too. We solve\nthis chicken-and-egg problem with societal pressures. By inducing people to\ncomply with social norms, we naturally raise the level of trust and induce\nmore people to cooperate. This is the positive feedback loop we're trying to\nget.\n\nSocietal pressures operate on society as a whole. They don't enforce\ncooperation in all people in all circumstances. Instead, they induce an\noverall level of cooperation. Returning to the immune system analogy, no\ndefense works in all circumstances. As long as the system of societal\npressures protects society as a whole, individual harm isn't a concern. It's\nnot a failure of societal pressure if someone trusts too much and gets harmed\nbecause of it, or trusts too little and functions poorly in society as a\nresult. What does matter is that the overall scope of defection is low enough\nthat the overall level of trust is high enough for society to survive and\nhopefully thrive.\n\nThis sounds callous, but it's true. In the U.S., we tolerate 16,000–18,000\nmurders a year, and a tax gap of $1.5 trillion. By any of the mechanisms\ndiscussed in Chapter 14, society gets to decide what level of defection we're\nwilling to tolerate, and those numbers have fluctuated over the years. These\nare only failures of societal pressure if society thinks these numbers are\neither too high or too low.\n\nIn Chapter 6, I talked about societal pressures as a series of knobs.\nDepending on the particular societal dilemma, society determines the scope of\ndefection it can tolerate and then—if it's all working properly—dials the\nsocietal pressure knobs to achieve that balance. Recall the Hawk-Dove game\nfrom Chapter 3; a variety of different initial parameters result in stable\nsocieties. If we want less murder, we increase societal pressures. If that\nends up being too expensive and we can tolerate a higher murder rate, we\ndecrease societal pressures.\n\nThat metaphor is basically correct, but it's simplistic. We don't have that\nlevel of accuracy when we implement societal pressures. In the real world, the\nknobs are poorly marked and badly calibrated, there's a delay after you turn\none of them before you notice any effects, and there's so much else going on\nthat it's hard to figure out what the effect actually is. Think of a bathtub\nwith leaky unmarked faucets, where you can't directly see the water coming out\nof the spout…outside, in the rain. You sit in the tub, oscillating back and\nforth between the water being too hot and too cold, and eventually you give up\nand take an uncomfortable bath. That's a more accurate metaphor for the degree\nof control we have with societal pressures.\n\nFigure 13 tries to capture all of\nthis.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1051213) On\nthe left is the main feedback loop, between new societal pressures and the\nscope of defection. New societal pressures cause a change in the scope of\ndefections, which causes a change in both risk and perceived risk. Then, the\nnew perceived risk causes calls for changes in societal pressures.\n\nNotice the delay between implementing new societal pressures and seeing\ncorresponding changes in the scope of defection. The delay comes from several\nsources. One, moral and reputational pressures are inherently slow. Anything\nthat affects risk trade-offs through a deterrence effect will require time\nbefore you see any effects from it. Depending on the form of government, new\ninstitutional pressures can also be slow. So can security systems: time to\nprocure, time to implement, time before they're used effectively.\n\nFor example, the [first people\narrested](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1275468) for\nwriting computer viruses in the pre-Internet era went unpunished because there\nweren't any applicable laws to charge them with. Internet e-mail was not\ndesigned to provide sender authentication; the result was the emergence of\nspam, a problem we're still trying to solve today. And in the U.S., the FBI\nregularly complains that the [laws regulating\nsurveillance](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1276159)\naren't keeping up with the rapidly changing pace of communications technology.\n\nTwo, it can take time for a societal pressure change to propagate through\nsociety. All of this makes it harder to fine-tune the system, because you\ndon't know when you're seeing the full effects of the societal pressures\ncurrently in place. And three, it takes time to measure any changes in the\nscope of defection. Sometimes you need months or even years of statistical\ndata before you know if things are getting better or worse.\n\nThe feedback is also inexact. To use a communications theory term, it's noisy.\nOften you can't know the exact effects of your societal pressures because\nthere are so many other things affecting the scope of defection at the same\ntime; in Figure 13, those are the “other considerations.” For instance, in the\nlate 20th century, the drop in the U.S. crime rate has been linked to the\n[legalization of\nabortion](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1276549) 20\nyears previously. Additionally, society's perceptions of risks are hard to\nquantify, and contain a cultural component. I'll talk more about this later in\nthe chapter.\n\nFigure 13: Societal Pressure's Feedback Loops\n\n![13](images/00017.jpg)\n\nA related feedback loop, shown as the lower loop on the left in Figure 13, is\nalso important. These are the [unintended\nconsequences](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1276942)\nof societal pressures that often directly affect the scope of defection. A\nlarge-scale example would be the effects on crime of Prohibition, or of\nincarcerating 16–25% of young black men in the U.S. A smaller-scale example is\nthat hiring guards to prevent shoplifting may end up [increasing\nshoplifting](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1277807),\nbecause regular employees now believe that it's someone else's job to police\nthe store and not theirs. Electronic sensor tags have a similar effect.\n\nSecurity systems are complex, and will invariably have side effects on\nsociety. This is shown as the loop on the right side of Figure 13. For\nexample, the U.S. incarceration rate has much broader social effects than\nsimply locking up criminals. Prohibition did, too. A simple side effect is\nthat some societal pressures, mostly security systems, cost money. More subtle\nside effects are [fewer bicycle\nriders](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1278111) as a\nresult of helmet laws, a [chilling effect\non](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1278979) computer-\nsecurity research due to laws designed to prevent the digital copying of music\nand movies, and [increased\nviolence](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1279290) as\na result of drug enforcement.\n\nDecisions about whether to implement a new societal pressure require careful\nconsideration of the [trade-off\nbetween](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1279757) its\ncosts and benefits—which are extremely difficult to predict.\n\nSecurity systems are often what economists call an experiential good:\nsomething you don't understand the value of until you've already bought,\ninstalled, and experienced\nit.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1051627) This\nholds true for other forms of societal pressure as well. If you're\nknowledgeable and experienced and perform a good analysis, you can make some\ngood guesses, but it can be impossible to know the actual effects—or\nunintended consequences—of a particular societal pressure until you've already\nimplemented it. This means that implementing societal pressures is always an\niterative process. We try something, see how well it works, then fine-tune.\n\nAny society—a family, a business, a government—is constantly balancing its\nneed for security with the side effects, unintended consequences, and other\nconsiderations. Can we afford this particular societal pressure system? Are\nour fundamental freedoms and liberties more important than more\nsecurity?[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1052714)\nMore onerous ATM security will result in fewer ATM transactions, costing a\nbank more than the ATM fraud. A retail store that installs security cameras in\nits dressing rooms will probably have fewer customers as a result, with a\ngreater loss of revenue than was saved by the decrease of shoplifting. Online\nretailers face similar choices, since complicated security measures reduce\npurchases. In Chapter 9, we talked specifically about how hard it is to get\nthe security effects of laws right. It's hard for all categories of societal\npressure.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1053112)\n\nWhat all of this means is that it's easy to get societal pressures wrong. We\nimplement more or less societal pressure than the risk warrants. We implement\nsuboptimal, ineffective, or the wrong kind of security systems. Then, when we\ntry to fix them, we get it wrong again. Many of the excesses in the War on\nTerror can be chalked up to overcompensation for the security failures that\nled to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nIn Chapters 7 through 10 we talked about how specific types of societal\npressure fail. Here, I am going to talk more generally about societal pressure\nfailures. These failures can be broken into several broad categories. These\ncategories aren't hard and fast, and there's going to be some overlap. The\ngoal here is just to give a feeling for how societal pressures can go wrong.\n\nMisunderstanding the actor. Potential defectors have many competing interests,\nranging from selfish to moral; if you misunderstand them, you're likely to get\nsecurity wrong. Defectors also have [different\ncharacteristics](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1280104),\nsuch as motivation, skill, money, risk aversion, and so on.\n\nIt makes no sense to spend $2 to forge an ID card worth $1, right? That's true\nif the defector is in it for the money. But if he's a security researcher\nanalyzing weaknesses in the production process, a competing company trying to\ndamage the business, or a hacker just trying to understand how the stuff\nworks, it might be. Similarly, if you think terrorists are all foreigners,\nyou'll miss the homegrown ones.\n\nWe've also touched on the problem of organized defectors. Organization is\ncommon in crime—well-funded criminal organizations are far more effective than\nlone criminals—and in\nterrorism.[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1053508)\nIt's also common among reform-minded defectors: abolitionists, animal rights\nactivists, and so on. When defectors organize, societal pressures that worked\nin the past might not work as well. We talked about both of these problems in\nChapter 11. A common misunderstanding is to assume that defectors are\nunorganized when they are—this happens often with crime—or to assume that\ndefectors are organized when they are not, as happened with al Qaeda.\n\nMisunderstanding the security incentives. Sometimes societal pressure can fail\nbecause it creates an incentive for the wrong competing norm. An example will\nhelp make this clear.\n\nConvincing people to reduce their trash is a societal dilemma. Moral pressure\nonly goes so far, and reputational pressure against having a lot of trash is\ngenerally pretty weak. By far the easiest institutional pressure is to charge\npeople by the amount of trash they generate: by the bag, by the bin, by the\npound. The idea is to tax marginal defection and encourage people to reduce\ntheir trash.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Limiting personal trash.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Limit the use of landfills.  \n  \nGroup norm: Limit trash. | Competing interest: Laziness or apathy.  \nCorresponding defection: Throw away as much trash as you want.  \nCompeting interest: Minimize cost.  \nCorresponding defection: Overstuff the trash can.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Awareness campaigns that emphasize the immorality of polluting.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Social pressure against people who put out a lot of trash.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Charge residents extra, based on how much trash they\nproduce.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Garbage\nmonitoring.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1054233)  \n  \nHowever, a resident who wants to avoid the extra charges has several other\noptions. He can stuff his trash more tightly into his bin. He can burn his\ntrash to reduce the volume. He can dump his trash on the side of the road, or\nin the bin of a neighbor down the block. These options were always available\nto him, but before the extra trash collection fee, there was no reason to\nbother. As soon as you add societal pressures, some people will look for ways\nto get around them without having to cooperate in the original dilemma.\n\nThis isn't just theoretical. A study of nine municipalities showed exactly\nthis sort of behavior—increases in trash burning and dumping—when [unit\npricing was](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1280459)\nimplemented. [Stuffing more\ntrash](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1281189) in the\nbins, known as the “Seattle stomp” after the municipality where it was first\nnoticed, is very common.\n\nThe failure here is the assumption that there is only one competing norm. In\nthis case, there are a variety of ways to defect. And if the societal\npressures only raise the cost of one competing norm, it could make the others\nmore attractive. In this example, the trash fee didn't increase the cost of\ngenerating more trash; it merely increased the cost of generating more trash\nand putting that trash in trash cans. Directly targeting trash creation would\nbe a better institutional pressure, but I can't think of any way a\nmunicipality could possibly make that work. On a larger scale, a disposal tax\ncould be assessed when someone purchases a product. This would motivate\nproduct manufacturers to reduce packaging, or otherwise make their products\nmore disposal-friendly, depending on the particulars of the tax. Of course,\nadministering that would be difficult, and society would have to balance that\ncost with the\nbenefit.[8](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1054574)\n\nMisunderstanding the risk. We don't make risk trade-offs based on actual risk;\nas shown in 13, we make them [based on\nperceived](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1281580)\nrisk. If we believe the scope of defection is higher or lower than it really\nis, we're not going to implement optimal societal pressures. And there are\nlots of ways we get risk wrong.\n\n[Natural\nBiases](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1281922) in\nRisk Perception  \n---  \nWe exaggerate risks that are… | We downplay risks that are…  \nSpectacular | Pedestrian  \nRare | Common  \nPersonified | Anonymous  \nBeyond our control | More under our control  \nExternally imposed | Taken willingly  \nTalked about | Not discussed  \nIntentional or man-made | Natural  \nImmediate | Long-term or diffuse  \nSudden | Evolving slowly over time  \nAffecting us personally | Affecting others  \nNew and unfamiliar | Familiar  \nUncertain | Well understood  \nDirected against children | Directed against adults  \nMorally offensive | Morally desirable  \nEntirely without redeeming features | Associated with some ancillary benefit  \n  \nThis is all well-studied by psychologists. Current U.S. counterterrorism\npolicy demonstrates these biases. Political scientist [John Mueller\nwrote](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1282747):\n\n> Until 2001, far fewer Americans were killed in any grouping of years by all\n> forms of international terrorism than were killed by lightning, and almost\n> none of those terrorist deaths occurred within the United States itself.\n> Even with the September 11 attacks included in the count, the number of\n> Americans killed by international terrorism since the late 1960s (which is\n> when the State Department began counting) is about the same as the number of\n> Americans killed over the same period by lightning, accident-causing deer,\n> or severe allergic reaction to peanuts.\n\nBut that's not the way people think. Terrorism is rare, spectacular, beyond\nour control, externally imposed, sudden, new and unfamiliar, uncertain,\npotentially directed against our children, offensive, and entirely without\nredeeming features. For these and other reasons, we [exaggerate the\nrisk](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1283071) and end\nup spending much too much on security to mitigate it.\n\nAnother example is computer crime. It's pedestrian, common, slowly evolving,\naffecting others, increasingly familiar, and (at least by techies) well-\nunderstood. So it makes sense that we understate the risks and underfund\nsecurity.\n\nThere are cultural biases to risk as well. According to one study conducted in\n23 countries, people have a higher risk tolerance in cultures that avoid\nuncertainty or are individualistic, and a lower risk tolerance in cultures\nthat are egalitarian and harmonious. Also—and this is particularly\ninteresting—the wealthier a country is, the lower its citizens' [tolerance for\nrisk](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1283446). Along\nsimilar lines, the greater the [income\ninequality](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1273063) a\nsociety has, the less trusting its citizens are.\n\nCreating a dilemma that encourages deception. Think back to the two prisoners\nfor a minute. Throughout this entire book, we've assumed that Alice and Bob\nare both actually guilty. What if they're not? Now, what is Alice's best\nstrategy?\n\nDisturbingly, it may still be in her best interest to confess and testify\nagainst Bob. Follow me here: if Bob lies and testifies against Alice, she is\nlooking at either six or ten years in jail. Lying and testifying against Bob\nis the better choice for Alice: six years is better than ten. And if Bob\nremains silent, she's looking at either freedom or one year in jail. Again,\nlying is the better choice for Alice: freedom is better than one year in jail.\nBy this analysis, both Alice and Bob fare best if they confess to crimes they\ndid not commit in an attempt to get leniency for themselves while falsely\naccusing the other. To make matters worse, assume that Bob is innocent and\nAlice is guilty. It's still in Alice's interest to falsely testify against\nBob.\n\nOf course, the risk trade-off is more complicated than that. Alice and Bob\nhave to assess the prosecutor's case, and weigh the trade-off between their\nfalse confession and the hope that justice will prevail in the end. But as\nsoon as the police offer Alice and Bob this deal, they increase the likelihood\nthat one or both of them will confess to a crime they didn't commit. This is\nthe reason that plea bargaining is illegal in many countries: it sets up\nperverse incentives. This can only be exacerbated by the surprising tendency\nof people to make [false\nconfessions](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1284146).[9](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1055031)\nGeneralizing, we find that all sorts of unsavory people try to align\nthemselves with the police in exchange for leniency for their own actions.\nThis kind of thing can happen whenever people cooperate with a norm they don't\nbelieve in.\n\nAccidentally making the costs of cooperation too high. Recall Chapter 11,\nwhere we talked about people assisting the police. One of Alice's potential\ncompeting interests is that cooperating with the police is too difficult,\ntime-consuming, or dangerous. So even if Alice wants to cooperate, the cost is\ntoo high and she's forced to defect. This is the reason laws requiring the\npolice to enforce immigration laws are a bad idea. The last thing you want is\nfor someone to be afraid to assist the police out of fear that he will be\ndeported. Another example is rape; if the cost of reporting a rape and helping\nprosecute the rapist is too emotionally high, women will not come forward. In\ngeneral, there is a cost associated with cooperating. If we want to limit\ndefections, we need to limit the costs—and/or increase the benefits—of\ncooperation.\n\nAccidentally increasing the incentive to defect. The point of societal\npressure is to induce cooperation. Sometimes the results are backwards, and\nsocietal pressure induces defection. Again, an example will explain this.\nCurrently in the United States, standardized student testing has incredible\ninfluence over the future fates of students, teachers, and schools. Under a\nlaw called the No Child Left Behind Act, students have to pass certain tests;\nif they don't pass, their schools are penalized. In the District of Columbia,\nthe school system offered teachers $8,000 bonuses for improving test scores,\nand threatened them with termination for failing. Scores did increase\nsignificantly during the period, and the schools were held up as examples of\nhow incentives affect teachers' behavior.\n\nIt turns out that a lot of those score increases were faked. In addition to\nteaching students, [teachers cheated\non](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1284736) their\nstudents' tests by changing wrong answers to correct ones.\n\nThere's a societal dilemma at work here. Teachers were always able to\nmanipulate their students' test scores, but before the No Child Left Behind\nlaw, the competing interests were weak. People become teachers to teach, not\nto cheat…until their jobs depended on it. When the competing interests became\nstronger, the school districts should have increased societal pressures,\nprobably security systems, to restore\nbalance.[10](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1055507)\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Cheating on students' tests.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Accurate testing of students.  \n  \nGroup norm: Allow students to take their own tests. | Old competing interest: Selfish interest of having a star classroom.  \nOld corresponding defection: Fake students' tests so they have a higher score.  \nNew competing interest: Financial reward, job retention.  \nNew corresponding defection: Fake students' tests so they have a higher score.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, society implements these\nsocietal pressures:\n\n> > Moral: Teacher integrity.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Loss of reputation if caught cheating.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Changing answers on students' tests is fraud, and there are\nlaws against it.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Secure handling of tests makes it harder for teachers to change\nanswers. Statistical [analysis of test\ndata](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1285105) can\nshow evidence of cheating.  \n  \nThere's a rule at work here. When you start measuring something and then judge\npeople based on that measurement, you encourage people to game the measurement\ninstead of doing whatever it is you wanted in the first place. If a company\npenalizes customer-support people for having long phone calls, they have an\nincentive to hang up on callers. If you reward software programmers for fixing\nbugs, they have an incentive to create buggy software to have bugs to fix\ninstead of getting it right the first\ntime.[11](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1056175) [If\nyou pay CEOs](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1285851)\nbased on stock price, they have an incentive to inflate the stock price at the\nexpense of the company's long-term interest.\n\nThe incentive to defect can also be increased when the reason a thing is\nattacked changes. Driver's licenses are a great example. Originally, they were\nnothing more than proof that a person is legally allowed to drive a car. As\nsuch, there wasn't much of an incentive to forge them, and security around the\nlicenses was minimal: they were made of paper, they didn't have photos, and so\non. In the U.S., at least, it was only when they started being used for a\ncompletely different purpose—age verification as a condition of buying\nalcohol—that forgeries started being a problem. In response, state governments\nchanged their licenses to include a variety of anti-forgery features:\nphotographs, watermarks and holograms, microprinting, and the like. Recently,\ntheir use has changed again. Since 9/11, they have been increasingly used as\nproof that a person isn't on a terrorist watch list. And now the government\nwants even more security features associated with them, like computer chips\nand enhanced security around their issuance.\n\nWe saw this with pair-bonding. Informal pair-bonding was enough to deal with\nDeacon's Paradox with respect to infidelity, but when inheritance became an\nissue, more formal mechanisms were required. Another example is joyriding;\nbecause joyriders never intended to keep the cars they stole, they couldn't be\ncharged with theft—so before specific joyriding laws were enacted, they got\noff relatively lightly.\n\nThe market can also increase the incentive to defect. When the price of glass\neels—immature eels that are a delicacy in Japan and Europe—started rising,\nmore people began to fish for them. The result was a Tragedy of the Commons:\nillegal overfishing and poaching in England, France, and the northeastern U.S.\nresulted in reduced yields, which resulted in higher prices. This resulted in\n[even more\noverfishing](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1286145),\neven further reduced yields, and even higher prices that rose from $25 to $950\nper pound. Enforcement just couldn't keep up, and poachers have devastated the\neel population. A technological advance might solve this societal dilemma;\nresearchers are trying to breed and [farm these\neels](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1287451), which\nwill increase supply and reduce the incentive to overfish.\n\nTechnological advances can magnify societal dilemmas as well. We'll talk about\nthis in the next chapter, but for now, think of the difference between banking\nin person and banking online, manual door locks and electronic locks, or paper\nballots and touch-screen voting machines. In all cases, the addition of\ntechnology makes some attacks easier.\n\nA final way the incentive to defect can increase is when the scale of the\nsocietal dilemma changes. We saw this in the difference between a single\nsandwich seller in a market and a large sandwich-producing corporation, and\nbetween Fisherman Bob and the Robert Fish Corporation. Large organizations can\ngain more, and inflict more damage on the group, by defecting. As\norganizations grow in size and power, societal pressures that might have\nworked in the past won't necessarily work as well any longer.\n\nMisunderstanding how different societal dilemmas interact. Societal dilemmas\ndon't exist in isolation, and societal pressures designed to decrease the\nscope of defection in one societal dilemma can, as a side effect, increase the\nscope of defection in another.\n\nFor example, we recognize that the police force is both a solution and a\nproblem. It is our agent in institutional pressures against criminals in\ngeneral, but as an institution with its own self-interests, it has to be\ndissuaded from defecting. So we have all sorts of societal pressures\nprotecting society from the police: rules limiting search and seizure, rules\nagainst self-incrimination, rules about interrogation, rules about evidence,\nand so on. These necessarily affect the defection rate of criminals by making\nthe police's job harder and more onerous, but we have them because—on\nbalance—the result is a better police force and a better society. Recently,\nthis has been changing. In our efforts to protect ourselves against terrorism,\nwe have been dismantling many of the societal pressures we've put in place to\nprotect ourselves from abuse by the police.\n\nSimilarly, over the past couple of decades we have dismantled a variety of\nfinancial regulations that limited the behavior of banks and other financial\ninstitutions.[12](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1057082)\nYes, those regulations made it harder for institutions to make money, but they\nalso served to protect society from the effects of widespread bank defection.\n\nIgnoring changing social norms. Sometimes societal norms change, and societal\ndilemmas start shifting to reflect the change. This often results in\nconflicting societal dilemmas as the new norms work their way through society,\nand in conflicts between subgroups within society who are either clinging to\nthe old norms or embracing the new ones.\n\nMy favorite example is historical. [In ancient\nRome](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1287770), it was\nimportant to worship the gods. It was also important that everyone in the\ncommunity worship the gods. The gods were angered if some people shirked their\nreligious responsibilities, like participating in festivals. This is one\nreason the Romans didn't like the early Christians. It's not that they\nworshipped their Christian god, it's that they didn't also worship the Roman\ngods. This was not simply a disagreement with Christians' personal choice; it\nwas seen as a danger to the whole community.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Worshipping Roman gods.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Making the Roman gods happy. | Competing interest: Making your own god happy.  \nGroup norm: Worshipping the Roman gods. | Corresponding defection: Not worshipping the Roman gods as well.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: From birth, Romans were taught their religion.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Romans who didn't participate in public religious ceremonies\nwere penalized by the community.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Serious offenders were thrown to the lions.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Lions.  \n  \nEventually, social norms changed. Christians became a larger and larger\nminority. They were increasingly tolerated. Sometime in the early 300s AD,\nEmperor Constantine converted to Christianity. And slowly, what had been\ndefection became cooperation.\n\nWhether and when societal pressure failed depends on your point of view. If\nyou believed in the Roman gods, then societal pressure failed when it didn't\nprevent Christians from offending the Roman gods. If you were an early\nChristian, then societal pressure failed when it didn't protect freedom of\nreligion.\n\nAnother example is sexual harassment in the workplace. As long as those in\npower in the organization didn't enforce prohibitions against men harassing\nsubordinate women, unwanted advances were relatively common and taken for\ngranted. It wasn't until a larger society started enforcing sexual harassment\nrules that occurrences began to decline.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with respect to gay marriage. It's a\nfundamentalist Christian belief that gay marriage isn't just a bad individual\nchoice, but that its very existence threatens the traditional family: just\nlike the Romans talking about Christianity. As such, it's a societal dilemma.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Gay marriage.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Protecting the institution of marriage. | Competing interest: Allowing everyone free choice in whom they can marry.  \nGroup norm: Only recognizing “approved” marriages. | Corresponding defection: Allowing gay couples to marry.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Teach gay marriage is wrong.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Ostracize same-sex couples.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Refuse to give same-sex couples the same legal rights as\ndifferent-sex couples. Pass laws making life especially difficult for same-sex\ncouples.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: None.  \n  \nOther people, though, don't see the dilemma. They don't accept that group\ndefection would result in the social calamity the fundamentalists do. Not only\ndo they defect, they don't even accept the dilemma as\nreal.[13](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1057638)\n\n[Norms can change\nquickly](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1288227) due\nto external threats. People are more willing to implement societal\npressures—both the kinds that reward cooperators and the kinds that punish\ndefectors—in times of war.\n\nMost of the time, though, social norms change slowly. We've repeatedly talked\nabout Deacon's Paradox, and how pair-bonding is a societal pressure.\nEnforcement of that has changed. There was a time when you could be stoned to\ndeath for adultery, or for fornication out of wedlock. Now, in most of the\nworld, that doesn't happen. There are even parts of the world where it isn't\neven frowned upon very heavily. And on the technological side, defecting from\npair-bonds has become safer. The “wages of sin” used to include pregnancy,\nwhich came with it significant health and financial risks, and venereal\ndisease. Cheap and effective birth control changed that, so much so that the\ncurrent societal dilemma for women is a very different risk trade-off. More\nrecently, unsafe sex practices brought with them a different set of health\nrisks, ones that could be effectively mitigated with technological security\nmeasures like condoms.\n\nOur evolving definitions of “society” show how societal norms evolve. As\nBarbara Jordan famously noted, the original definition of “we the people” in\nthe U.S. didn't include [women or\nslaves](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1288716). Over\nthe centuries, our definitions of who is within the bounds of society have\ngradually become more inclusive.\n\nYou can see this evolution in the societal dilemma surrounding the current\ntone and integrity of [political\ndebates](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1289075) in\nthe United States. The goal of politics—elections, policy debates, laws—is to\ngovern the country by enacting the best policies for society and implementing\nthe best laws to solve societal dilemmas. But there's a competing interest of\ngetting laws passed that benefit us in particular. We're all better off if\nnational policy debates are factual, honest, and civil, but it's easy to\nresort to spin, distortions, smears, and lies. But if enough people do that,\nyou get the circus that characterizes far too much of current American\npolitics.[14](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1057991)\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Policy debates.  \n---  \nSociety: Society as a whole.  \nGroup interest: Make the best policy decisions. | Competing interest: For your side to win.  \nGroup norm: Debate public policy fairly, whatever that might mean. | Corresponding defection: Debate by whatever means necessary.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: Shame, honesty, honorability, and so on.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Shame and ridicule heaped on dishonest politicians.\nReputation for statesmanship bestowed on honest ones.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: For particularly egregious lies, libel laws. Anti-\ngerrymandering laws.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: The proper use of rhetoric. Fact checking.  \n  \nIt's not clear that the level of dishonesty is new, but it seems to be carried\nout on a much broader scale today. Moral and reputational pressures used to\nwork, but they are failing as the country bifurcates into two different groups\nwith completely separate systems of values. Legal controls that impinge on\nfree speech are a dangerous option. One solution is to stop gerrymandering\nsafe legislative seats. By forcing these seats to be decided in the general\nelection, as opposed to party-specific primaries or caucuses, candidates would\nhave to appeal to swing centrist voters rather than their base. But potential\nlegal societal pressures would be viewed as partisan, and untenable for that\nreason.\n\nWhat's going on here is that the definition of “society” is changing. “Society\nas a whole” has less meaning in a polarized political climate such as the one\nin the U.S. in the early 21st century. People are defining their society as\nthose who agree with them politically, and the other political side as\n“traitors,” people who “hate America,” or people who “want the terrorists to\nwin.” It's no surprise that there's widespread defection: with regard to the\nnew, more restrictive, definition of “society,” it's not defection at\nall.[15](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1058480)\n\n\nChapter 16\n\nTechnological Advances\n\nScale is one of the critical concepts necessary to understand societal\npressures. The increasing scale of society is what forces us to shift from\ntrust and trustworthiness based on personal relationships to impersonal\ntrust—predictability and compliance—in both people and systems. Increasing\nscale is what forces us to augment our social pressures of morals and\nreputation with institutional pressure and security systems. Increasing scale\nis what's requiring more—and more complicated—security systems, making overall\nsocietal pressures more expensive and less effective. Increasing scale makes\nthe failures more expensive and more onerous. And it makes our whole societal\npressure system less flexible and adaptable.\n\nThis is all because increasing scale affects societal pressures from a number\nof different directions.\n\n  * More people. Having more people in society changes the effectiveness of different reputational pressures. It also increases the number of defectors, even if the percentage remains unchanged, giving them more opportunities to organize and grow stronger. Finally, more defectors makes it more likely that the defecting behavior is perceived as normal, which can result in a Bad Apple Effect.\n\n  * Increased complexity. More people means more interactions among people: more interactions, more often, over longer distances, about more things. This both causes new societal dilemmas to arise and causes interdependencies among dilemmas. Complex systems need to rely on technology more. This means that they [have more flaws](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1289566) and can [fail in surprising](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1289882) and catastrophic ways.\n\n  * New systems. As more and different technology permeates our lives and our societies, we find new areas of concern that need to be addressed, new societal dilemmas, and new opportunities for defection. Airplane terrorism simply wasn't a problem before airplanes were invented; Internet fraud requires the Internet. The job of the defenders keeps getting bigger.\n\n  * New security systems. Technology gives certain societal pressure systems—specifically, reputational and institutional—the ability to scale. Those systems themselves require security, and that security can be attacked directly. So online reputation systems can be poisoned with fake data, or the computers that maintain them can be hacked and the data modified. Our webmail accounts can be hacked, and scammers can post messages asking for money in our name. Or our identities can be stolen from information taken from our home computers or centralized databases.\n\n  * Increased technological intensity. As society gets more technological, the amount of damage defectors can do grows. This means that even a very small defection rate can be as bad as a greater defection rate would have been when society was less technologically intense. This holds true for the sociopath intent on killing as many people as possible, and for a company intent on making as much profit as possible, regardless of the environmental damage. In both cases, technology increases the actor's potential harm. Think of how much damage a terrorist can do today versus what he could have done fifty years ago, and then try to extrapolate to what upcoming technologies might enable him to do fifty years from now.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1059296) Technology also allows defectors to better organize, potentially making their groups larger, more powerful, and more potent.\n\n  * Increased frequency. Frequency scales with technology as well. Think of the difference between someone robbing a bank with a gun and a getaway car versus someone stealing from a bank remotely over the Internet. The latter is much more efficient. If the hacker can automate his attack, he can steal from thousands of banks a day—even while he sleeps. [This aspect of scale](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1290342) is becoming much more important as more aspects of our society are controlled not by people but by automatic systems.\n\n  * Increased distance. Defectors can act over both longer physical distances and greater time intervals. This matters because greater distances create the potential for more people, with weaker social ties, to be involved; this weakens moral and reputational pressure. And when physical distances cross national boundaries, institutional pressure becomes less effective as well.\n\n  * Increased inertia and resistance to change. Larger groups make slower decisions; and once made, those decisions persist and may be very difficult to reverse or revise. This can cause societal pressures to stagnate.\n\nIn prehistoric times, the scale was smaller, and our emergent social\npressures—moral and reputational—worked well because they evolved for the\nsmall-scale societies of the day. As civilization emerged and technology\nadvanced, we invented institutions to help deal with societal dilemmas on the\nlarger scales of our growing societies. We also invented security technologies\nto further enhance societal pressures. We needed to trust both these\ninstitutions and the security systems that increasingly affected our lives.\n\nWe also developed less tolerance for risk. For much of our species' history,\nlife was dangerous. I'm not just talking about losing 15–25% of males to\nwarfare in primitive societies, but infant mortality, childhood diseases,\nadult diseases, natural and man-made accidents, and violence from both man and\nbeast. As technology, especially medical technology, improved, life became\nsafer and longer. Our tolerance for risk diminished because there were fewer\nhazards in our lives. (Large, long-term risks like nuclear weapons, genetic\nengineering, and global warming are much harder for us to comprehend, and we\n[tend to\nminimize](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1290664)\nthem as a result.)\n\nToday, societal scale continues to grow as global trade increases, the world's\neconomies link up, global interdependencies multiply, and international legal\nbodies gain more power. On a more personal level, the Internet continues to\nbring distant people closer. Our risk tolerance has become so low that we have\na fetish for eliminating—or at least [pretending to\neliminate](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1290994)—as\nmuch risk as possible from our lives.\n\nLet's get back to societal pressures as a series of knobs. Technology is\ncontinuously improving, making new things possible and existing things easier,\ncheaper, better, or more reliable. But these same technological advances\nresult in the [knobs being\ntwiddled](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1291310) in\nunpredictable ways. Also, as scale increases, new knobs get created, more\npeople have their hands on the knobs, and knobs regulating different dilemmas\nget interlinked.\n\nNew technologies, new innovations, and new ideas increase the scope of\ndefection in several dimensions. Defectors innovate. Attacks become easier,\ncheaper, more reliable. New attacks become possible. More people may defect\nbecause it's easier to do so, or their defections become more frequent or more\nintense.\n\nThis results in a security imbalance; the knob settings that society had\ndeemed acceptable no longer are. In response, society innovates. It implements\nnew societal pressures. Perhaps they're based on new laws or new technology,\nperhaps there is some new group norm that gets reflected in society's\nreputational pressure, or perhaps it's more of what used to work. It's hard to\nget right at first, because of all the feedback loops we discussed, but\neventually society settles on some new knob settings, and the scope of\ndefection is reduced to whatever new level society deems tolerable. And then\nsociety is stable until the next technological innovation.\n\nFigure 14: Societal Pressure Red Queen Effect\n\n![14](images/00018.jpg)\n\nIf Figure 14 looks familiar, it's because it's almost the same as [Figure\n3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_009.html#filepos101550) from\nChapter 2. This is a Red Queen Effect, fueled not just by natural selection\nbut also by technological innovation. Think of airport security,\ncounterfeiting, or software systems. The attackers improve, so the defenders\nimprove, so the attackers improve, and so on. Both sides must continuously\nimprove just to keep pace.\n\nBut it's not a normal Red Queen Effect; this one isn't fair. Defectors have a\nnatural advantage, because they can make use of innovations to attack systems\nfaster than society can use those innovations to defend itself. One of\nsociety's disadvantages is the delay between new societal pressures, and a\ncorresponding change in the scope of defection, which we talked about in the\nprevious chapter. In fact, the right half of Figure 14 is the same as the main\nfeedback loop of [Figure\n13](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_025.html#filepos755735), but with\nless detail.\n\nMore generally, defectors are quicker to use technological innovations.\nSociety has to implement any new security technology as a group, which implies\nagreement and coordination and—in some instances—a lengthy bureaucratic\nprocurement process. Unfamiliarity is also an issue. Meanwhile, a defector can\njust use the new technology. For example, it's easier for a bank robber to use\nhis new motorcar as a getaway vehicle than it is for the police department to\ndecide it needs one, get the budget to buy one, choose which one to buy, buy\nit, and then develop training and policies for it. And if only one police\ndepartment does this, the bank robber can just move to another town.\nCorporations can make use of new technologies of influence and persuasion\nfaster than society can develop resistance to them. It's easier for [hackers\nto find](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1291660)\nsecurity flaws in phone switches than it is for the phone companies to upgrade\nthem. [Criminals can\nform](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1292129)\ninternational partnerships faster than governments can. Defectors are more\nagile and more adaptable, making them much better at being early adopters of\nnew technology.\n\nWe saw it in law enforcement's initial inability to deal with Internet crime.\n[Criminals were\nsimply](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1292967) more\nflexible. Traditional criminal organizations like the Mafia didn't move\nimmediately onto the Internet; instead, new Internet-savvy criminals sprung\nup. They established websites like CardersMarket and DarkMarket, and\nestablished new crime organizations within a decade or so of the Internet's\ncommercialization. Meanwhile, law enforcement simply didn't have the\norganizational fluidity to adapt as quickly. They couldn't fire their old-\nschool detectives and replace them with people who understood the Internet.\nTheir natural inertia and their tendency to sweep problems under the rug\nslowed things even more. They had to spend the better part of a decade playing\ncatch-up.\n\nThere's one more problem. Defenders are in what the 19th-century military\nstrategist Carl von Clausewitz called “the [position of the\ninterior](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1293462).”\nThey have to defend against every possible attack, while the defector just has\nto find one flaw and one way through the defenses. As systems get more\ncomplicated due to technology, more attacks become possible. This means\ndefectors have a first-mover advantage; they get to try the new attack first.\nAs a result, society is constantly responding: shoe scanners in response to\nthe shoe bomber, harder-to-counterfeit money in response to better\ncounterfeiting technologies, better anti-virus software to combat the new\ncomputer viruses, and so on. The attacker's clear advantage increases the\nscope of defection further.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. Sometimes societal pressures improve without\nit being a reaction to an increase in the scope of defection. There are\ntechnologies that immediately benefit the defender and are of no use at all to\nthe attacker. Fingerprint technology allowed police to identify suspects after\nthey left the scene of the crime, and didn't provide any corresponding benefit\nto criminals, for example. The same thing happened with immobilizing\ntechnology for cars, alarm systems for houses, and computer authentication\ntechnologies. Some technologies benefit both, but still give more advantage to\nthe defenders. The radio allowed street policemen to communicate remotely,\nwhich makes us safer than criminals communicating remotely endangers us.\n\nStill, we tend to be reactive in security, and only implement new measures in\nresponse to an increased scope of defection.\n\nBecause the attackers generally innovate faster than the defenders, society\nneeds time to get societal pressures right. The result of this is a security\ngap: the difference between the scope of defection that society is willing to\ntolerate and the scope of defection that exists. Generally, this gap hasn't\nbeen an insurmountable problem. Sure, some defectors are able to get away with\nwhatever it is they're doing—sometimes for years or even decades—but society\ngenerally figures it out in the end. Technology has progressed slowly enough\nfor the Red Queen Effect to work properly. And the slowness has even helped in\nsome situations by minimizing overreactions.\n\nThe problem gets worse as technology improves, though. Look at Figure 15. On\nthe top, you can see the difference between the defectors' use of\ntechnological innovation to attack systems and the defenders' use of\ntechnological innovations in security systems and other types of societal\npressures. The security gap arising from the fact that the attackers are\nfaster than the defenders is represented by the area under the technology\ncurve between the two lines.\n\nFigure 15: The Security Gap\n\n![15](images/00019.jpg)\n\nComparing the top picture with the middle one shows the difference between\nless and more technology. In the middle, the gap between attacker and defender\nis the same width, but because there's more technology, the area is greater.\nThere are actually two dimensions to innovation: technological advancement and\ntechnological prevalence. In either dimension, the more technology there is,\nthe greater the security gap. In other words, if there are more innovations to\nexploit, there will be more damage resulting from society's inability to keep\nup with exploiters of all of them.\n\nThink about it this way. Technology is available to both the attackers and the\ndefenders, and it's pretty much all there is until moral, reputational, and\ninstitutional pressures catch up. When there's more technology out there, the\nattackers have more opportunity to increase the scope of defection before the\ndefenders catch up. Technology can affect the scope of defection in many ways,\nbut in general, it gives the attackers more leverage. So the more\ntechnological a society is, the greater the security gap is.\n\nThis is an intrinsic condition of the problem, for all the reasons we just\ntalked about. The security gap cannot be eliminated.\n\nThe security gap is also greater in periods of rapid technological change, as\nsociety struggles to manage the broader social changes as well as quickly\nadapting defectors do. In 1970, futurist [Alvin Toffler\nwrote](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1293731) about\nfuture shock, the psychological and social problems that result from people\nbeing forced to absorb too much technological change too quickly. His\nestimates about how much technological change people could deal with were way\ntoo low—the rate of technological change in the second decade of the 21st\ncentury is much faster than the seventh decade of the 20th—but his basic ideas\nare sound. [People learn\nhow](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1294009) to cope\nwith new technologies at their own pace, some more easily than others. And\ngroups of people move more slowly than some of their members. Defectors are\nnot inherently less susceptible to future shock than society at large, but the\nmore successful ones are. Successful defectors are always going to be able to\noutpace the average capability of society.\n\nAgain, look at Figure 15, the bottom this time. In a period of rapid change,\ntechnology increases faster, so the curve climbs higher in the same period of\ntime than in the earlier figures. This faster growth rate makes for a larger\narea under the curve in the same period of time—a greater security gap.\n\nThis has happened before, notably in the 19th century. That's when we got\nrailroads, steamships, the widespread use of paper mail, the telegraph, and\nthen the telephone—all allowing people to communicate at greater distances and\nwith greater speed. But perhaps even more important than any of that, there\nwere significant changes in attitudes about people and the world. Society came\nto expect economic growth, along with universal education and universal\nbetterment. The world changed, and that affected security.\n\nThe ease of rapid travel meant more people traveled. On one hand, this meant\nthat you could no longer distrust people just because they came from “out of\ntown.” On the other, this allowed for a [new type of\ngrifter](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1294331),\nconning people out of their money and moving on before he could be caught. At\nthe same time, cities got larger.. Policing in 18th-century London was a\nhodge-podge of unpaid and unorganized constables and a draconian court system\n(160 different crimes carried the death penalty). This sort of community\npolicing didn't scale to a large modern city, so Sir Robert Peel organized the\nfirst modern police force and criminal justice system. [Other cities\nfollowed](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1294641)\nsuit.\n\nTechnology directly changed society as well. The telegraph meant that money\ncould be transferred instantaneously, but the open nature of the system meant\nconversations could be eavesdropped on and spoofed. So operators developed\ncodes to prevent that. Other examples were the mass production of timepieces,\nmaking it easier to manage employees; the rise of unions, giving employees\nmore power with respect to their employers; and the telegraph and then the\ntelephone, an enormous change in communication that affected everyone. It was\nan age where defectors adapted to a changing society, and society had to adapt\nto changing defectors.\n\nToday, we're seeing the effects of both more technology than ever before and a\nfaster rate of technological change than ever\nbefore.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1059896) In\nparticular, the revolutionary social and political changes brought about by\ninformation technology are causing security and trust problems to a whole new\ndegree. We've already seen several manifestations of this: the global\nfinancial crisis, international terrorism, and cyberspace fraud. We've seen\nmusic and movie piracy grow from a minor annoyance to an international problem\ndue to the ease of distributing pirated content on the Internet. We've seen\nInternet worms progress from minor annoyances to criminal tools to military-\ngrade weapons that cause real-world damage, like the [Internet worm\nStuxnet](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1295139), the\nfirst military-grade cyberweapon the public has seen. All this has come about\nbecause information technology increases the scope of defection in several\nways:\n\n  * Migration of all data onto the Internet. As data moves onto computer networks, there are more—and, more importantly, different—risks. The security that worked when the systems were manual, or housed on computers not attached to a global network, no longer works.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1061399)\n\n  * Technological mediation of social systems. Similarly, social systems—including systems of reputational pressure—are vulnerable to technological attacks as they become technologically enabled. For example, e-mail has security risks that paper mail does not. Electronic voting has security risks that paper voting does not. Internet telephony has security risks that conventional telephony does not.\n\n  * Migration of evolved social systems into deliberately created socio-technical systems. In Chapter 14, we discussed the problem of delegating societal pressures to institutions, specifically government institutions. More and more, we are delegating societal pressures to corporations: the security of our conversations, our photographs, and our data. This trend of corporations acting as institutions gives those corporations more ability and incentive to defect.\n\n  * Class breaks. A product, or line of products, may have common vulnerabilities that impact every copy of the product that has ever been made. As globalization allows a single product to be used worldwide, the discovery of such a vulnerability can have a global impact. This is not new, but information systems are particularly prone to this type of problem. Information systems have common vulnerabilities that can be exploited en masse. Someone who finds, for example, a vulnerability in an operating system that allows him to steal data can steal data from the entire class of computers using that operating system.\n\n  * Automation. Information system attacks can be automated. Instead of manually having to break into computer systems, an attacker can write a program to do it automatically. This not only drastically increases the frequency of defection, it also has two other effects. One, it makes attacks whose probability of success is very small viable. And two, it makes attacks whose profitability is very small—so-called [salami attacks](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1295517) because of how thinly sliced each instance of fraud is—viable.\n\n  * Action at a distance. Attacks that used to require the attacker to get up close and personal to his victims can now be done remotely, from anywhere on the planet. It used to be that a store in Los Angeles didn't have to worry about burglars living in London or Lagos; those places were simply too far away for it to be worth the burglar's time or expense to fly to Los Angeles. But on the Internet, every web store has to worry about every cyber burglar in the world. There are no natural defenses against distance. Similarly, 20 years ago, few Americans had to worry about encountering Ukrainian or Nigerian criminals. On the Internet, it happens constantly.\n\n  * Technique propagation. Because information system attacks can be automated and encapsulated in software, the capability to launch these attacks can propagate. No longer does a criminal have to learn how to attack a security system: pick a lock, defraud a bank, or whatever. On the Internet, only the first attacker has to be skilled. Everyone else can [just use software](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1295819).\n\n  * Technique iteration and improvement. Because attacks can be so efficient, it's easier for attackers to learn from their mistakes and improve their attacks. They can create ten varieties of a computer worm and test which one works best, or a hundred varieties of spam to see which one fools recipients best. Because so many Internet attack tools become public, it's easy for one attacker to learn from another's work.\n\n  * Defector aggregation. One thing that makes it easier to defect from society is finding a subgroup of defectors. This both makes it easier to overcome moral and reputational pressures, and allows defectors to trade tips on overcoming the legal pressure and security systems. The Internet itself lets defectors easily find and communicate with like-minded individuals. There's a whole online community of people who think childhood immunization is evil. There are terrorist-sympathetic websites, which might—it's hard to separate reality from media hype—also act as terrorist-recruiting websites. There are a gazillion places on the Internet where you can learn to hack computer systems and commit fraud.\n\nThere are two more changes that belong on this, too, but they won't fit neatly\ninto bullet points: changes in organizational structure and changes in\norganizational behavior.\n\nLet's start with organizational structure. The Internet reduces the cost of\norganization dramatically, enabling ad hoc and loosely connected organizations\nof individuals who contribute tiny amounts of effort towards a large\ngoal.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1062481)\nLinux and Wikipedia are both informally produced and freely available\n“products” created by legions of unpaid volunteers; and both are viable\ncompetition to corporate, traditionally created, alternatives. Crowdsourcing\ncan produce results superior to more traditional mechanisms of delegating\nwork.\n\nFrom a societal pressure perspective, the normal competing interests we've\ncome to expect from traditional organizations don't apply in the same way to\nthese ad hoc organizations. For example, Microsoft can be—and in the past has\nbeen—pressured by the U.S. government to deliberately weaken encryption\nsoftware in its products, so the government could better spy on people. This\nworks because Microsoft is an American corporation, and in at least some ways\nbeholden to American interests. Its operating system competitor, Linux, is\nnot. Linux is an open-source operating system, not controlled by a business.\nThe Linux team, even the few individuals at the core, are not motivated by\nprofit. They're not in any one country. They are probably unlikely to agree to\na confidential meeting with government officials of any nationality. They are\na different sort of actor. On the other hand, Microsoft probably has better\nsystems in place to prevent infiltration by rogue programmers.\n\nWikiLeaks is another stateless organization. WikiLeaks sits somewhere between\na loose organization of activists and the personal mission of a single\nindividual named Julian Assange. It exposes information that governments and\npowerful corporations would rather keep secret. In this way it is very much\nlike an organization of journalists. But because it is not a commercial\nenterprise, and because it is not moored within a country, it's much more\ndifficult to corral. And this scares countries like the United States.\n\nCompare WikiLeaks to a traditional newspaper. That newspaper is in a societal\ndilemma with all the other newspapers in that country.\n\nSocietal Dilemma: Newspapers publishing government secrets.  \n---  \nSociety: All the newspapers in the country and the government.  \nGroup interest: Government not clamping down on freedom of the press. | Competing interest: Increase market share.  \nGroup norm: Self-censor. | Corresponding defection: Publish any juicy secrets you discover.  \nTo encourage people to act in the group interest, the society implements a\nvariety of societal pressures.\n\n> > Moral: It's unpatriotic, or otherwise wrong, to publish government\n> secrets.\n>\n\n>> Reputational: Newspapers want good reputations because it keeps their\nreaders, advertisers, and sources all happy.\n\n>\n\n>> Institutional: Often, none. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that\nit is legal to publish secrets, even though it is illegal to leak them.\n\n>\n\n>> Security: Potentially, espionage that lets the government know when a story\nis about to leak.  \n  \nThis doesn't look like effective societal pressure, but it largely works. It\nworks because, even in the absence of any laws, the pressure to cooperate—to\nself-censor—is surprisingly powerful. No press organization wants to be\nlabeled as unpatriotic or traitorous, or jeopardize its advertisers.\n\nThe result is that newspapers sometimes publish embarrassing government\nsecrets, and sometimes they don't. In 1971, the New York Times published the\nPentagon Papers, a secret and damning history of U.S. military involvement in\nVietnam. In mid-2004, the New York Times learned about the NSA's illegal\nwiretapping of American citizens without a warrant, but [delayed\npublishing](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1296150)\nthe information for over a year—until well after the presidential election.\nPresumably there are things the New York Times has learned about and decided\nnot to publish, period.\n\nWikiLeaks changes that dynamic. It's not an American company. It's not even a\nfor-profit company. It's not a company at all. And it's not really located in\nany legal jurisdiction. It simply isn't subject to the same pressures that the\nNew York Times is. This means the government can't rely on the partial\ncooperation of WikiLeaks in the same way it can rely on that of traditional\nnewspapers.[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1062803)\n\nIn a blog post about the topic, [Clay Shirky\nreferred](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1296540) to\nthe Supreme Court ruling in the Pentagon Papers case that said it's illegal to\nleak secrets but not illegal to publish leaks:\n\n> The legal bargain from 1971 simply does not and cannot produce the outcome\n> it used to. This is one of the things freaking people in the US government\n> out about the long-term change in the media environment—not that the law has\n> changed, but that the world has.

The U.S. government has much less\nleverage to pressure El Pais or Al Jazeera to change its coverage than it does\nwith the New York Times. That mattered less before the Internet could bring\nall those news sources to everyone so easily.\n\nThis unmooring of institutions from nationality is upending many societal\npressures; things that used to work no longer do. We saw the same dynamic in\ninternational corporations, which can more easily skirt national laws by\nmoving between different countries.\n\nNow to the final change, which is organization behavior. In addition to\nallowing organizations to grow in size, and therefore power, and facilitating\nnew types of organizational structures, information technology is also\nchanging how organizations act.\n\nThere have been many books and articles discussing how corporations today are\nputting short-term stock prices above all [other business\nconsiderations](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1296880),\nincluding company health and long-term shareholder value. I've read lots of\nexplanations for this change. That executives' bonuses are based on short-term\nnumbers. That stocks are used more for short-term “bets” than for long-term\ninvestments. That mutual funds and complex index options further remove\ninvestors from the companies they invest in. And that [investors have\naccess](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1298024) to\nmore information faster—and can act on that information faster.\n\nYou get what you\nmeasure,[6](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1063598)\nand things like short-term profitability are much easier to measure than\nabstract concepts like long-term viability, or intangibles like customer\nsatisfaction or reputation. An important facilitator for this dynamic—I don't\nknow whether it's a cause or not—is information technology. Improved\ninformation technology makes the short-term numbers easier to monitor, so\ninvestors monitor them much more closely than ever before. This continuous\nmonitoring makes them easier to optimize. We are better able to predict what a\ncompany's balance sheet will look like next week, and because we're so quick\nto trade one company for another, we care much less what it will look like in\nfive years. This necessarily changes how investing works and how organizations\nbehave: and the two are locked in a positive-feedback loop.\n\nAll these effects of ever-faster information technology affect other\norganizations at every scale, from the smallest groups to the entire world.\n\n![4](images/00003.jpg)\n\nModern large and technological trade-offs between group interest and competing\ninterest are what social planners call [wicked\nproblems](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1298338).\nThese are problems that are difficult (or impossible) to solve because of\nincomplete, poorly understood, contradictory, or changing requirements;\nbecause of complex interdependencies; and because of their uniqueness and\nnovelty. Examples include global climate change, AIDS and pandemics in\ngeneral, nuclear waste, terrorism and homeland security, drug trafficking and\nother international smuggling, and national healthcare. All of those problems\ninvolve societal pressures, and all of their solutions involve coercing people\ninto following group norms ahead of other competing interests.\n\nBut—and this is important—all of the big societal pressure problems are about\nmore than trust and security. They're interdependent with other societal\ndilemmas. They're interdependent with other societal systems. They have moral,\nsocial, economic, and political dimensions. Their solutions involve answering\nquestions about how society organizes itself, the role of national and\ninternational government, the extent of individual liberties, and what sort of\noutcomes are optimal and desirable. And these aspects of the problems are far\nmore important, and difficult, than the trust aspects. It's not simply a\nmatter of implementing the best societal pressures to induce broad\ncooperation; everything else matters more. The geopolitics that results in\nterrorism matter much more than any particular security measure against\nterrorists. The politics in which multinational corporations thrive matter\nmuch more than the societal pressures to ensure those corporations cooperate.\nThe politics surrounding drug laws, tax laws, laws protecting civil liberties,\nand our social safety net matter much more than the societal pressures to\nensure that those laws are followed. Look back to the figure in Chapter 15;\nthe “constraints” and the “other considerations” are more important than the\nprimary loop.\n\nHere's one example. In 2011, science fiction author Charles Stross gave a talk\non the [ubiquity of\ndata](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1298953) that's\ncoming in the near future, from technologies like genetic mapping,\n“lifeblogging”—the audio and video recording of everything that happens to\nyou—sensors on everyone and everything. Nothing he said required anything more\nthan mild extrapolation. And then he talked about the issues that society is\ngoing to have to wrestle with once this data exists:\n\n> Is losing your genomic privacy an excessive price to pay for surviving\n> cancer and evading plagues? (Broad analysis of everyone's genetic data will\n> result in significant new understanding about disease, and a flurry of\n> medical results that will significantly benefit everyone. At the same time,\n> an individual's genetic data is both personal and private—even more so when\n> companies start using it to prejudge people.)\n\n> Is compromising your sensory privacy through lifeblogging a reasonable price\n> to pay for preventing malicious impersonation and apprehending criminals?\n> (Lifeblogs have the potential to be a valuable police tool, not just by\n> allowing victims to record crimes, but in the incidental recording of events\n> in the background that later could be instrumental in identifying\n> criminals.)\n\n> Is letting your insurance company know exactly how you steer and hit the gas\n> and brake pedals, and where you drive, an acceptable price to pay for\n> cheaper insurance? (Once insurance companies have all of this data, they\n> could more easily offer differing insurance policy to different types of\n> drivers.)\n\nThese are all societal dilemmas about how to balance group interest with self-\ninterest. But before figuring out what kind of societal pressures to deploy to\nsolve the problem, society first has to agree what the group interest is. We\ncan't start talking about what kind of societal pressures to set up to prevent\npeople from keeping their genome secret, or protecting the privacy of their\nlifeblog, or limiting access to their car's “black box” data, until we agree\non what it means to cooperate and what it means to defect in these situations.\nIt's difficult to solve societal dilemmas while society itself is changing so\nquickly.\n\nThis isn't the first time technological change has caused social changes that\nforced us to rethink society, and it won't be the last. The trick will be\ngetting societal pressure right in a society that's moving so fast that\ngetting it wrong is an increasingly dangerous option. This means getting\nfaster and better at setting societal pressure knobs. It means setting them\nright the first time, and then correcting them quickly in response to\nfeedback, delays, and technological changes. To that end, here is a list of\nprinciples for designing effective societal pressures:\n\n  * Understand the societal dilemma. Not just what the group interest is, but what the group norm is, what the competing norms are, how the societal dilemma relates to other societal dilemmas, what the acceptable scope of defection is, and so on. A lot of ineffective societal pressures come from not understanding the true problem.\n\n  * Consider all four societal pressures. It's common to believe that one is enough: that reputation obviates the need for laws, or that a good security system is sufficient to enforce compliance. It's rare that this is true, and effective societal pressure usually involves all four categories, though not necessarily in equal measure. Considering all four will indicate how resources might be most effectively spent.\n\n  * Pay attention to scale. The scale of the societal dilemma influences how effective each of the four societal pressures will be. Noticing the scale, and noticing when the scale changes, is vital.\n\n  * Foster empathy and community, increasing moral and reputational pressures. In our large, anonymous society, it's easy to forget moral and reputational pressures and concentrate on legal pressure and security systems. This is a mistake; even though our informal social pressures fade into the background, they're still responsible for most of the cooperation in society.\n\n  * Use security systems to scale moral and reputational pressures. The two social pressures work best on the small scale, but security systems can enhance them to work at much larger scales. They don't work the same way, and the security systems are themselves open to attack. Still, we can't simply replace moral and reputational pressures with institutional pressures, so it is important to use technology in this way.\n\n  * Harmonize institutional pressures across related technologies. There shouldn't be one law for paper mail and another for e-mail, or one law for telephone conversations and another for Internet telephony. This sort of thing used to work back when technology changed slowly. Now, by the time the legal system grinds through the process of creating a law, it may already be technologically obsolete. We need to make laws technologically invariant. This won't be easy, but we need to try.\n\n  * Ensure that financial penalties account for the likelihood that a defection will be detected. As I discussed in Chapter 13, a financial penalty that is too low can easily become a cost of doing business. If we expect a fine to be an effective societal pressure, it needs to be more expensive than the risk of defecting and paying it.\n\n  * Choose general and reactive security systems. Just as we need to make laws technologically invariant, we need to make security systems defector-invariant. That is, we need to concentrate on the broad motivations for defection, rather than on blocking specific tactics, to prevent defectors from working around security systems. One example is counterterrorism, where society is much [better off spending](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1299294) money on intelligence, investigation, and emergency response than on preventing specific terrorist threats, like bombs hidden in shoes or underwear.\n\n  * Reduce concentrations of power. Power, whether it's concentrated in government, corporations, or non-government organizations, brings with it the ability to defect. The greater the power, the greater the scope of defection.[7](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1064475) One of the most important things society can do to reduce the risk of catastrophic defection is to reduce the amount of power held by individual actors in key positions.\n\n  * Require transparency—especially in corporations and government institutions. Transparency minimizes the principal–agent problem and ensures the maximum effect of reputational pressures. In our complex society, we can't monitor most societal dilemmas directly. We need to rely on others—proxies—to do the work for us. Checks and balances are the most powerful tool we have to facilitate this, and transparency is the best way to ensure that checks and balances work. A corollary of this is that society should not suppress information about defectors, their tactics, and the overall scope of defection.\n\nWe're currently in a period of history where technology is changing faster\nthan it ever has. The worry is that if technology changes too fast, the\ndefectors will be able to innovate so much faster than society can that the\nimbalances become even greater—increased scope of defection leading to an even\nmore increased scope of defection—which can cause large societal failures.\nThink of what would happen to the Red Queen Effect if the stoats evolved\nfaster than the rabbits: they would become significantly faster than the\nrabbits, then eat all the rabbits, and then all starve (assume there's no\nother prey). Defectors in societal dilemmas can have the same effect if they\nevolve too quickly: they overwhelm the cooperators, which means there are no\nmore cooperators, and the defectors themselves lose. Remember, parasites need\nsociety to be there in order to benefit from defecting; and being a parasite\nis a successful strategy only if you don't take too many resources from your\nhost.\n\nOn the other hand, we're also in a period of history where the ability for\nlarge-scale cooperation is greater than it ever has been before. In 2011, law\nprofessor [Yochai\nBenkler](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1299629)\npublished a book that is in many ways a companion volume to this one: The\nPenguin and The Leviathan: How Cooperation Triumphs Over Self-Interest.\nBenkler writes that the Internet can and has enabled cooperation on a scale\nnever seen before, and that politics—backed by science—is ready to embrace\nthis new cooperation:\n\n> I am optimistic in thinking that we are not ripe to take on the task of\n> using human cooperation to its fullest potential—to make our businesses more\n> profitable, our economy more efficient, our scientific breakthroughs more\n> radical, and our society safer, happier and more stable….\n\n> For decades we have been designing systems tailored to harness selfish\n> tendencies, without regard to potential negative effects on the enormous\n> potential for cooperation that pervades society. We can do better. We can\n> design systems—be they legal or technical; corporate or civic;\n> administrative or commercial—that let our humanity find a fuller expression;\n> systems that tap into a far greater promise and potential of human endeavor\n> than we have generally allowed in the past.\n\nThe lesson of this book isn't that defectors will inevitably ruin everything\nfor everyone, but that we need to manage societal pressures to ensure they\ndon't. We've seen how our prehistoric toolbox of social pressures—moral and\nreputational systems—does that on a small scale, how institutions enhance that\non a larger scale, and how technology helps all three systems scale even more.\n\nOver a decade ago, I wrote that “[security is a\nprocess](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1299980), not\na product.” That's true for all societal pressures. The interplay of all the\nfeedback loops means that both the scope of defection and the scope of\ndefection society is willing to tolerate are constantly moving targets. There\nis no “getting it right”; this process never ends.\n\n\nChapter 17\n\nThe Future\n\nSociety can't function without trust, and our complex, interconnected, and\nglobal society needs a lot of it. We need to be able to trust the people we\ninteract with directly: as we sit next to them on airplanes, eat the food they\nserve us in the cabin, and get into their taxis when we land. We need to be\nable to trust the organizations and institutions that make modern society\npossible: that the airplanes we fly and the cars we ride in are well-made and\nwell-maintained, that the food we buy is safe and their labels truthful, that\nthe laws in the places we live and the places we travel will be enforced\nfairly. We need to be able to trust all sorts of technological systems: that\nthe ATM network, the phone system, and the Internet will work wherever we are.\nWe need to be able to trust strangers, singly and in organizations, all over\nthe world all the time. We also need to be able to trust indirectly; we need\nto trust the trust people we don't already know and systems we don't yet\nunderstand. We need to trust trust.\n\nMaking this all work ourselves is impossible. We can't even begin to\npersonally verify, and then deliberately decide whether or not to trust, the\nhundreds—thousands?—of people we interact with directly, and the millions of\nothers we interact with indirectly, as we go about our daily lives. That's\njust too many, and we'll never meet them all. And even if we could magically\ndecide to trust the people, we don't have the expertise to make technical and\nscientific decisions about trusting things like airplane safety, modern\nbanking, and pharmacology.\n\nWriting about trust, economist Bart Nooteboom said: “[Trust in\nthings](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1300464) or\npeople entails the willingness to submit to the risk that they may fail us,\nwith the expectation that they will not, or the neglect of lack of awareness\nof that possibility that they might.” Those three are all intertwined: we\naren't willing to risk unless we're sure in our expectation that the risk is\nminor, so minor that most of the time we don't even have to think about it.\n\nThat's the value of societal pressures. They induce compliance with the group\nnorms—that is, cooperation—so we're able to approximate the intimate trust we\nhave in our friends on a much larger scale. It's not perfect, of course. The\ntrust we have in actions and systems isn't as broad or deep as personal trust,\nbut it's good enough. Societal pressures reduce the scope of defection. In a\nsense, by trusting societal pressures, we don't have to do the work of\nfiguring out whether or not to trust individuals.\n\nBy inducing cooperation throughout society, societal pressures allow us to\nrelax our guard a little bit. It's less stressful to live in a world where you\ntrust people. Once you assume people can, in general and with qualifications,\nbe trusted to be fair, nice, altruistic, cooperative, and trustworthy, you can\nstop expending energy constantly worrying about security. Then, even though\nyou get burned by the occasional exception, your life is still more\ncomfortable if you continue to\nbelieve.[1](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1064947)\n\nWe intuitively know this, even if we've never analyzed the mechanisms before.\nBut the mechanisms of societal pressure are important. Societal pressures\nenable society's doves to thrive, even though there's a minority of hawks.\nSocietal pressures enable society.\n\nAnd despite the largest trust gap in our history, it largely works. It's easy\nto focus on defection—the crime, the rudeness, the complete mess of the\npolitical system in several countries around the world—but the evidence is all\naround you. Society is still here, alive and ticking. Trust is common, as is\nfairness, altruism, cooperation, and kindness. People don't automatically\nattack strangers or cheat each other. Murders, burglaries, fraud, and so on\nare rare.\n\nWe have a plethora of security systems to deal with the risks that remain. We\nknow how to walk through the streets of our communities. We know how to shop\non the Internet. We know how to interact with friends and strangers,\nwhether—and how—to lock our doors at night, and what precautions to take\nagainst crime. The very fact that I was able to write and publish this book,\nand you were able to buy and read it, is a testament to all of our societal\npressure systems. We might get it wrong sometimes, but we largely get it\nright.\n\nAt the same time, defection abounds. Defectors in our society have become more\npowerful, and they've learned to evade and sometimes manipulate societal\npressures to enable their continued defection. They've used the rapid pace of\ntechnological change to increase their scope of defection, while society\nremains unable to implement new societal pressures fast enough in response.\nSocietal pressures fail regularly.\n\nThe important thing to remember is this: no security system is perfect. It's\nhard to admit in our technologically advanced society that we can't do\nsomething, but in security there are a lot of things we can't do. This isn't a\nreason to live in fear, or even necessarily a cause for concern. This is the\nnormal state of life. It might even be a good thing. Being alive entails risk,\nand there always will be outliers. Even if you reduced the murder rate to one\nin a million, three hundred unlucky people in the U.S. would be murdered every\nyear.\n\nThese are not technical problems, though societal pressures are filled with\nthose. No, the biggest and most important problems are at the policy level:\nglobal climate change, regulation and governance, political process, civil\nliberties, the social safety net. Historically, group interests either\ncoalesced organically around the people concerned, or were dictated by a\ngovernment. Today, understanding group interests increasingly involves\nscientific expertise, or new social constructs stemming from new technologies,\nor different problems resulting from yet another increase in scale.\n\nPhilosopher Sissela Bok wrote: “…[trust is a social\ngood](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1300789) to be\nprotected just as much as the air we breathe or the water we drink. When it is\ndamaged the community as a whole suffers; and when it is destroyed, societies\nfalter and collapse.” More generally, [trust is the\nkey](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1301118)\ncomponent of social capital, and high-trust societies are better off in many\ndimensions than low-trust societies. And in the world today, levels of trust\nvary all over the map—although never down to the level of\nbaboons.[2](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1065338)\n\nWe're now at a critical juncture in society: we need to implement new societal\nsystems to deal with the new world created by today's globalizing\ntechnologies. It is critical that we understand what societal pressures do and\ndon't do, why they work and fail, and how scale affects them. If we do, we can\ncontinue building trust into our society. If we don't, the parasites will kill\nthe host.\n\nIn closing, there are several points I want to make.\n\nNo matter how much societal pressure you deploy, there always will be\ndefectors. All complex ecosystems contain parasites, and all human systems of\ncooperation and trust include people who try to take advantage of them. This\nwill not change as long as societies are made up of humans. The possibility of\nperfect trust, or unbreakable security, is a science-fiction future that won't\nhappen in the lifetime of anyone we know.\n\nIncreasing societal pressure isn't always worth it. It's not just the problem\nof diminishing returns discussed in Chapter 10. Looking back through history,\nthe societies that enforce cooperation and conformance to the group norm, that\nruthlessly clamp down and punish defectors, and that monitor every aspect of\ntheir citizens' lives are not societies we think of as free. This is true\nwhether the norms accurately reflect the desires of the group or are imposed\nfrom the top\ndown.[3](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1067630)\nSecurity always has side effects and unwanted consequences.\n\nThis is okay. We've repeatedly talked about societal pressures as being\nnecessary to sustain\ntrust.[4](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1069066)\nThis doesn't mean absolute trust, and it doesn't imply 100% cooperation. As\nlong as the murder rate is low enough, speeders are few enough, and policemen\non the take are rare enough, society flourishes.\n\nSocietal pressures can prevent cooperation, too. Not only do we sometimes fail\nto punish the guilty, we sometimes punish the innocent. People get reputations\nthey don't deserve; people get convicted of crimes they didn't commit. And if\nthe scope of defection is low enough, these false positives can be greater\nthan the defection attempts thwarted. That's when you know it's time to dial\nback the knob.\n\nWe all defect at some times regarding some things. Sometimes we're simply\nbeing selfish. Sometimes we have another, stronger, self-interest. Sometimes\nwe're just not paying attention. Sometimes our morality just doesn't permit us\nto cooperate with the group norm. And sometimes we feel a stronger attachment\nto another group, and its associated interests and norms. This is also okay.\n\nSometimes we defect honestly and innocently. Group norms can be too rigid for\nthe way we live our lives. The white lies of our normal social interactions\nmake relationships better, not worse. Sometimes assistants need to sign\ndocuments for their bosses, and sometimes attorneys and accountants need to\ninnocently backdate documents. Sometimes defecting is a form of social\nlubricant: small social dishonesties that make life easier for everyone.\n\nThere are good defectors and there are bad defectors, and we can't always tell\nthe difference—even though we think we can. We know that murderers are always\nbad and that pro-democracy demonstrators are always good, but even those\ntruisms fray at the edges. Was the U.S.'s assassination of Osama bin Ladin\ngood or bad? Is it okay that pro-democracy protesters in Egypt and other\ncountries are anti-U.S. and anti-Israel? U.S. troops in Iraq may be either\ngood or bad, depending on whether you're safely in the U.S., whether your\ndaughter was just killed by one of them, or whether you own an oil company.\nMany defectors believe they are morally right: animal-rights activists who\nfree animals from testing laboratories, the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and the\nNazis in Germany, just to name a few. And so did the Tiananmen Square\nprotesters in China, and the United States' founding fathers.\n\nI stumbled on [this\nparable](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1301778) on\nthe Internet as I was writing this book:\n\n> There was this kid who came from a poor family. He had no good options in\n> life so he signed up for the military. After a few years he was deployed to\n> a conflict infested, god-forsaken desert outpost. It was the worst tour of\n> duty he could have been assigned. It was going to be hot and dangerous.\n> Every day he had to live with a hostile populace who hated his presence and\n> the very sight of his uniform. Plus, the place was swarming with insurgents\n> and terrorists.\n\n> Anyhow, one morning the soldier goes to work and finds that he's been\n> assigned that day to a detail that is supposed to oversee the execution of\n> three convicted insurgents. The soldier shakes his head. He didn't sign up\n> for this. His life just totally sucks. “They don't pay me enough,” he\n> thinks, “for the shit I have to do.”\n\n> He doesn't know he's going to be executing the Son of God that day. He's\n> just going to work, punching the time clock, keeping his head down. He's\n> just trying to stay alive, get through the day, and send some money back\n> home to Rome.\n\nSystems of societal pressure can't tell the difference between good or bad\ndefectors. Societal pressures are the mechanism by which societies impose\nrules upon themselves, even as the societies overlap and conflict. Those rules\ncould be good, like a respect for human rights or a system for enforcing\ncontracts. Those rules could be bad, like slavery, totalitarianism,\npersecution, or ritual murder. Or those rules could be perceived as good by\nsome societies and bad by others: arranged marriages; heavy taxation; and\nprohibitions against drinking, dancing, pot smoking, or sharing music files\nvia BitTorrent. Societal pressures simply enforce cooperation, without much\nconsideration as to why the defector chose some competing interest. This is a\ngood thing when it protects individuals from harm, loss, or social injustice,\nand a bad thing when it protects a regime that is not good to its people or\nprevents positive social change.\n\nSociety needs defectors. Groups benefit from the fact that some members [do\nnot follow](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1302083)\nthe group norms. These are the outliers: the people who resist popular opinion\nfor moral or other reasons. These are the people who invent new business\nmodels by copying and distributing music, movies, and books on the Internet.\nThese are people like Copernicus and Galileo, who challenged official Church\ndogma on astronomy. These are the people who—to take a recent example—disrupt\nenergy auctions to protest government responsibility for climate change.\nThey're also people living on the edge of society: squatters, survivalists,\nartists, cults, communes, hermits, and those who live off the grid or off the\nland. In 2011, U.S. Marine Dakota Meyer received the [Medal of\nHonor](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1302451) for\nsaving three dozen of his comrades who were under enemy fire. The thing is, he\ndisobeyed orders in order to do so.\n\nDefection represents an engine for innovation, an immunological challenge to\nensure the health of the majority, a defense against the risk of monoculture,\na reservoir of diversity, and a catalyst for social change. It's through\ndefection from bad or merely outdated social norms that our society improves.\nIn the stoat vs. rabbit Red Queen Effect from Chapter 2, it's the stoats that\ndrive the change. Left to themselves, the rabbits will not improve.\n\nThis is important. The societies that societal pressures protect are not\nnecessarily moral or desirable. In fact, they can protect some pretty awful\nones. And because societal pressures necessarily become institutionalized—in\npolice forces, in government agencies, in corporate security departments—they\ncan be co-opted to justify and maintain those awful societies' awful\ninstitutions.\n\nSometimes a whistle-blower needs to publish documents proving his government\nhas been waging an illegal bombing campaign in Laos and Cambodia. Sometimes a\nplutonium processing plant worker needs to [contact a\nreporter](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_031.html#filepos1302811) to\ndiscuss her employer's inadequate safety practices. And sometimes a black\nwoman needs to sit down at the front of a bus and not get up. Without\ndefectors, social change would be impossible; stagnation would set in.\n\nIt's a tough balancing act, but I think we're up to it. Maybe not in the near\nterm, but in the long term. History teaches how often we get it right. As\nMartin Luther King, Jr., said: “The arc of history is long, but it bends\ntoward\njustice.”[5](CR%21NWQDA428115SZ2HPAZ6ZFDXV7X6Q_split_029.html#filepos1069650)\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI consider writing a book to be a social as well as a solitary activity.

TERRENCE GORDON\n\nIn a letter written to his in-laws on Christmas Day 1960, Marshall McLuhan\nmentioned that he had drafted a book in less than a month. Of all his\npublications, _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ (henceforth _GG_), so explosive on the\npage, had the tidiest beginnings. The manuscript flowed from McLuhan’s pen\nuntil he had written 399 pages. There he stopped, so that the total of the\ncarefully numbered foolscap sheets would be divisible by three. (As a symbol\nof intellectual and spiritual order, the number three retained great\nimportance for him throughout his life.)\n\nThe book’s true beginnings go back at least to McLuhan’s teaching days at St\nLouis University in the 1930s and ’40s, when he discussed ideas concerning the\nprint medium and its effects with colleagues and students, friends, and\nneighbours. In 1951, having finally seen the protean manuscript of _The\nMechanical Bride_ through the press, after a very long gestation period, his\nthoughts returned to those discussions with Walter Ong and others. Within a\nyear, McLuhan announced to Ezra Pound that he was “writing a book on ‘The End\nof the Gutenberg Era’”[1](fm01.html#fm01en1a) and sent him an eighteen-point\noutline of the work, pitching it as the “icon smashing” groundwork for an\noverhaul of undergraduate education.\n\nToday, a half-century after _GG_ first appeared in print, the proliferation of\nelectronic media has inevitably dwarfed the scope of the commentary that\nMcLuhan wrote when television and computers were still in their infancy, but\nthe passage of time has not diminished the iconoclastic force of the book.\n(Nor has that proliferation diminished the need for an overhaul of\nundergraduate education.) It is best read not simply as a harbinger of a post-\nliterate society that would bewilder Johannes Gutenberg and that McLuhan\nhimself would be shocked to find so entrenched so early in the twenty-first\ncentury, but as an enduring challenge to understand its subversive purpose.\n\nThough many commentators radically misread McLuhan as intending to hasten the\ncollapse of book culture, in fact he issued a call for shoring it up: “Far\nfrom wishing to belittle the Gutenberg mechanical culture, it seems to me that\nwe must now work very hard to retain its achieved\nvalues.”[2](fm01.html#fm01en2a) _GG_ provides progressively stronger hints to\nthe reader as to how this can be done; the companion volume (_Understanding\nMedia_ , promised in _GG_ ’s closing pages) explicitly states that retaining\nbook culture can only be done by avoiding the errors of the\npast.[3](fm01.html#fm01en3a) Pandora’s box cannot be\nclosed,[4](fm01.html#fm01en4a) need not be closed, provided we ask if the\ngifts spilling from it may impoverish us.\n\nThe cover of _GG_ , perhaps promising by its title to be a science-fiction\nthriller, bore two upper-case Gs, set in huge type. Linked as mirror images of\neach other, the white letters gleam against a red background. They hint at a\nvortex, mock its surge, and tug in a paralysed, stylized parody of print\ntechnology impoverishing the integration of the five senses by privileging the\neye alone. But the interlocking design is also a labyrinth with easy access to\nits centre, a medium within a medium, the lost world of acoustic space and\nintegrated senses destined for resurgence in the post-Gutenberg era. The\nbook’s cover thus announced a theme into which McLuhan plunges on the first\npage of his prologue;[5](fm01.html#fm01en5a) a theme that is at the core of\nall his subsequent major works from _Understanding Media_ to the posthumously\npublished _Laws of Media_.\n\nMcLuhan’s contract for _GG_ referred to it as “The Gutenberg Era,” a phrase\nfound in its pages, but he settled on _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , not only for\nits alliterative value but to emphasize that a configuration of events had\nbeen spawned by the invention of the printing press. (Crucially, the second\nprincipal section of the book deals with the _re_ configuration of Gutenberg’s\nlegacy and lays a foundation for examining events precipitated by the\nelectronic galaxy and studying media in a framework still applicable today.)\n“Galaxy” allowed McLuhan to focus on media-induced events and to evoke his\ntheme of effects as a cluster of environmental changes.\n\nMcLuhan cites a score of writers and thinkers in his opening pages, including\nhistorians of science, technology, and medicine. To these he will later add\nreferences to social and cultural historians, economists, and political\nscientists.[6](fm01.html#fm01en6a) But it is telling that even as his prologue\ndraws to a close and sets up the opening of the section entitled The Gutenberg\nGalaxy, all such references give way to a lengthy discussion of Shakespeare,\nW.B. Yeats, Cervantes. This is typical of the preference that McLuhan\nconsistently displays for drawing on the insights of artists more than on the\ndiscursive writings of analysts. So, for example, he acknowledges his debt to\nHarold Innis (see discussion below), but quotes him less often than he quotes\nJames Joyce. (The chapter gloss for _GG_ on [page 201](ch02a.html#page_201)\nalerts readers that Thomas Nashe, the subject of McLuhan’s doctoral thesis at\nCambridge University, was the Elizabethan counterpart to James Joyce.) The\nsame trend is in evidence in McLuhan’s writing predating _GG_ and in all his\nlater works – and for reasons which he makes clear.\n\nWyndham Lewis, for example, had a new conception of what art is: “Life with\nall the humbug of living taken out of it.”[7](fm01.html#fm01en7a) McLuhan had\na new conception of what media could be when put into the hands of artists:\n“The media are not toys; they should not be in the hands of Mother Goose and\nPeter Pan executives … The wild broncos of technological culture have yet to\nfind their busters or masters. They have found only their P.T.\nBarnums.”[8](fm01.html#fm01en8a)\n\nThough Lewis is quoted in _GG_ only for his views on Italian antiquarianism,\nhe had long since served McLuhan as a model for avoiding categorical\njudgments. McLuhan’s impetus towards the principles of integration and\nsynthesis in all his work resonates with Lewis’s ideal of reintegrating the\narts of sculpture, painting, and architecture. In the first volume of the\njournal _Blast_ , Lewis, as editor, had articulated the principle that the\nartist is not the slave of commotion but its master; McLuhan, the navigator of\nthe electronic maelstrom that swamped the Gutenberg era, would teach the\nprinciple that understanding media provides the means of keeping them under\ncontrol. Lewis understood the fragmenting effects of technology and spoke of\nthem in terms that would be closely paralleled in McLuhan’s writings,\nbeginning with _GG_. Lewis’s concept of space contains the core of the idea\nthat McLuhan would develop as the distinction between visual and acoustic\nspace.\n\nLike Lewis, McLuhan would move beyond his original aesthetic interests in the\nworld of the arts to understanding the relationship between art and\ntechnology. McLuhan shared Lewis’s concept of the artist being inextricably\nlinked to the inevitable encroachments of technology. Both men accepted the\nnecessity of facing the effects of technological advances as detached\nobservers of their causes. Lewis’s notion of the vortex as a mask of energy in\nrelation to both art and technology was applied by McLuhan to language _as\nboth art and technology._\n\nMcLuhan knew Lewis’s observation that the artist is always writing a history\nof the future because he alone is aware of the nature of the present, and he\ntook this less as an article of faith than as a fact that could be\ndemonstrated by citing and interpreting passages from Lewis, Joyce, Pound,\nEliot, and others who showed their insights into the impact of new\ntechnologies. Such passages provided implicit programmatic statements for the\neducational reform at the heart of McLuhan’s vision. By contrast,\nshortcomings, inconsistencies, and errors of judgment were all too apparent to\nhim in the works of analytical thinkers, including Harold Innis, to whom he\nnevertheless paid full homage.\n\nMcLuhan and Harold Innis enjoyed a meeting of minds only in the closing years\nof the latter’s life. Innis, a brilliant theorist who had joined the\nUniversity of Toronto’s Department of Political Economy in 1920, was seventeen\nyears McLuhan’s senior. Motivated, like McLuhan, by dissatisfaction with\nconventional wisdom, Innis had rejected the application of standard analytical\nmodels for the Canadian economy in his first book, _The Fur Trade in Canada_\n(1930), in which he developed the staple theory of economic development. In so\ndoing, he gave McLuhan an idea rich in potential application to media, namely\nthat the effect of a new staple or natural resource is essentially the same as\nthe effect of a new medium of communication, in the sense that both function\nas technological extensions of our physical senses. This notion figures\nprominently in the chapter gloss to _GG_ on [page 164](ch02a.html#page_164),\nwhere it is not only acknowledged as deriving from Innis but related to the\nwork of many other authors, including Lewis Mumford, biblical scholar John L.\nMackenzie, Shakespeare, and others by way of opening the discussion of the\nvitally important topic of sense ratios (see comments on _economy of the\nsensorium_ below).\n\nInnis and McLuhan shared a lively sense of humour and a writing style that not\nonly pushed apparent incongruities together but crushed them into punchy\nphrases. For years Innis had laboured very much as a voice in the wilderness,\nand McLuhan saw why: “Harold Innis was never understood simply because he\nworked with causality at all times.”[9](fm01.html#fm01en9a) McLuhan’s insight\nhere did not prevent him from working with causality himself; he eventually\ncame to the point where he could say: “My own writing has been entirely in the\nworld of formal causality, the study of _effects_ , rather than the assertion\nof values. This approach I owe to Harold Innis and his _Bias of\nCommunication_[1951].”[10](fm01.html#fm01en10a)\n\nMcLuhan saw not only that Innis was misunderstood, but what he did not\nunderstand and why: he lacked training in the arts. McLuhan was prepared to\nfill in the gaps in Innis’s education. He regarded Innis’s 1950 study _Empire\nand Communication_ as programmatic and told him so in a letter showing the\nfundamental links between Innis’s work and the framework of thought that\nMcLuhan had discovered in Cambridge, developed in his doctoral dissertation,\nand drawn upon for _The Mechanical Bride_ : “Many of the ancient language\ntheories of the Logos type which you cite for their bearings on government and\nsociety have recurred and amalgamated themselves today under the auspices of\nanthropology and social psychology. Working concepts of ‘collective\nconsciousness’ in advertising agencies have in turn given salience and\npractical effectiveness to these ‘magical notions of\nlanguage.’”[11](fm01.html#fm01en11a)\n\nMcLuhan went on to enlighten Innis about the aesthetic discoveries of the\nFrench symbolists and how their legacy had been nurtured by Joyce, Eliot,\nPound, Lewis, and Yeats. But he recognized that, even without the benefit of\nthis knowledge, Innis had “discovered how to arrange his insights in patterns\nthat nearly resemble the art forms of our time.”[12](fm01.html#fm01en12a) The\nremark applies to McLuhan himself and to the structure of _GG_ as much as it\ndoes to Innis.\n\nMcLuhan declared that Innis was unaware of the underlying dynamics of the\nculture/technology interplay that he examined in his writings, in so far as he\nfailed to distinguish between mechanical and electronic technologies.\nMoreover, McLuhan declared Innis had radically misread Wyndham Lewis. Yet\nMcLuhan emphasized Innis’s genius and his own great debt to him: “Until the\nwork of Harold Innis, I have been unable to discover any epistemology of\nexperience, as opposed to epistemology of knowledge.”[13](fm01.html#fm01en13a)\n\nMcLuhan spoke of Innis’s “intellectual monopoly of the study of the psychic\nand social consequences of technological innovation.”[14](fm01.html#fm01en14a)\nPivotal ideas in _The Gutenberg Galaxy, Understanding Media_ , and even later\nworks McLuhan drew from Innis: “If you look at Harold Innis’s _Empire and\nCommunication_ , you will see the evidence for the fact that phonetic writing\ndestroyed Greek society without their having the slightest notion of how it\nhappened.”[15](fm01.html#fm01en15a)\n\nSoon after the publication of _GG_ , McLuhan appropriated figure-ground\nanalysis from its home domain of gestalt psychology and integrated it into his\napproach to media analysis, acknowledging in so doing that Innis had done so\nbefore him. He also speculated on Innis’s place in the development of the\nbroad current of intellectual inquiry referred to as structuralism: “His great\ninsight was that every situation can be studied structurally by asking the\nquestion: ‘What is the primary stress or action that holds this whole\nstructure in place?’ I think he got this approach from Max Weber. Weber had\nused it for institutions. Innis extended the approach to media. This\nstructural approach tends to dispense with the accidents of\n‘content.’”[16](fm01.html#fm01en16a) Dispensing with the accidents of content\nis precisely the crucial step required to develop the insight that McLuhan\nwould formulate as _the medium is the message_.\n\nMcLuhan also gave Innis the credit for the basis of his own work on the\neconomy of the human sensorium (the relationship among the five physical\nsenses): “My own approach, following Harold Innis, is a transformation theory,\nthus homeostasis of the perceptual factors in a rapidly changing environment\nrequires much redistribution of emphasis among the senses. For example, a\nblind or deaf person compensates for the loss of one sense by a heightening of\nactivity in the others. It seems to me that this also occurs in whole\npopulations when new technologies create new sensory environments [by\namputation].”[17](fm01.html#fm01en17a) This is precisely the foundational\nlesson of _GG_.\n\nMcLuhan went so far as to set Innis in a pantheon, alongside the unlikely\ntriumvirate of Abraham Lincoln, Henry Thoreau, and Albert\nEinstein.[18](fm01.html#fm01en18a) And he traced a thread from Samuel Taylor\nColeridge to Innis that is of particular interest, given the influence of\nColeridge on I.A. Richards and of Richards on\nMcLuhan.[19](fm01.html#fm01en19a)\n\nEven Innis’s phrase _the nemesis of creativity_ (blindness to the effects of\none’s most significant form of invention) would make its way into McLuhan’s\nwork as a chapter heading for _Understanding Media._ Qualities McLuhan\nidentified in the work of Innis are to be found in his own work throughout\n_GG_ : the expression of insights through aphorisms and a mosaic structure of\npresentation, the expectation that readers will make their own discoveries, an\nabhorrence of the debilitating effects of the specialist approach to\nknowledge, a concern with the power of form to alter the action of other\nforms, the identification of cultural patterns in their psychic and social\ndimensions on the basis of a society’s dominant technology, and, above all, a\nrefusal to present ideas with any concession to the expectations of readers.\n\nIf, as McLuhan says, the whole of _GG_ can be taken as a footnote of\nexplanation to Innis’s work,[20](fm01.html#fm01en20a) it is also very much a\nfootnote to McLuhan’s own _Report on Project in Understanding the New Media_\n(the report on his sabbatical project for the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters, completed a scant six months before he drafted the\nholograph of _GG_ in 1960).[21](fm01.html#fm01en21a)\n\nThe U.S.-based National Association of Educational Broadcasters (henceforth\nNAEB) approved McLuhan’s proposal for a study of media in June 1959. NAEB\nproject 69 was launched, and McLuhan, as always, was pleased that the number\nwas divisible by three. He referred to the project as “Vat 69,” where he\ntossed every idea in his purview, in the hope of someday giving the subject\nthe fuller treatment it deserved. Later, his enthusiastic but anxious editors\nfor _Understanding Media_ would naively believe that this meant he intended to\ngive it a more orderly treatment. In _GG_ , the ideas distilled from the NAEB\nreport are set out in mosaic format.\n\nThe NAEB commission to McLuhan gave him a completely free hand to design a\nteaching method and syllabus for use in introducing the nature and effects of\nmedia to the curriculum of secondary schools. Sponsored jointly by the NAEB\nand the United States Office of Education, McLuhan would carry out research,\nconduct interviews, and launch a program of media testing with the assistance\nof the Ryerson Polytechnic Institute in Toronto. He got started on his work\nthe same month that the project was approved, travelling to Philadelphia to\nconfer on the design of his project with Harry Skornia, then professor of\nradio and television broadcasting at the University of Illinois at Urbana and\npresident of the NAEB, and with author Gilbert Seldes.\n\nThe study would take up all of McLuhan’s time, with a final report date\nscheduled to coincide with the end of his sabbatical year. But he completed a\nthirty-five-page sample syllabus before 1959 was out. It began: “Teachers\ntoday face a quite different environment from the one they themselves grew up\nin.”[22](fm01.html#fm01en22a) The echoes of this statement suffuse _GG_.\n\nAs objectives for courses in media he listed effects of media interacting, the\nnature of print, and new electronic technology as top priorities. He pointed\nout that “increased awareness of the forms of media, as they operate upon our\nmodes of perception and judgement, is not merely a means of understanding but\nof prediction and control,”[23](fm01.html#fm01en23a) a notion for which _GG_\nlays the groundwork to be developed in chapter eight of _Understanding Media_.\n\nMcLuhan spoke of the mental discipline required to transpose the realities of\nlife into new spheres and the dislocating effect of media. He referred to\nJames Joyce and cited Peter Drucker’s _Landmarks of Tomorrow_ for its\nprescient views on the merging of purpose in education and business. As in\n_GG_ , McLuhan stressed the power of the print medium, evoking sources from\nRabelais to Innis as he homed in on his own vision of educational reform:\n“This role of the artist as herald and model-maker affords a major resource in\nunderstanding media. In fact, it indicates a natural means of integration of\nthe curriculum, whether in history, mathematics or language and [i.e., with]\nmedia study. This syllabus will attempt, in some degree, to provide a means of\noverall integration, while also coming to grips with particular\nmedia.”[24](fm01.html#fm01en24a)\n\nWriting as an achievement of sedentary societies, writing preceded by\nsculpture, sculpture as modelling of auditory space, writing as translation of\nauditory space, the division of labour and partial dissociation of sensory\nlife in sedentary society, the work of Innis, manuscript culture, printing,\nthe message of repeatability, print and perspective, print and industry – all\nof these were crammed into McLuhan’s syllabus outline. Reader Arthur Wells\nFoshay commented that “media” was not in the average teacher’s vocabulary and\nneeded introduction and explanation, adding: “You understand it, and I do, but\nwill they believe it in Dubuque?”[25](fm01.html#fm01en25a)\n\nWhere McLuhan wrote that “print learnt in childhood may prove to have been a\nmajor block to learning in many subjects besides\nmusic,”[26](fm01.html#fm01en26a) Foshay cautioned: “Don’t underestimate the\nshock this comment will have, especially for teachers. You could lose a\nmajority of your audience right here … Can’t you ease up on this\npoint?”[27](fm01.html#fm01en27a) McLuhan was not about to ease up on anything,\nmuch less the insight that had been his starting point for the investigation\nof contrasting media effects. Fifteen pages into his text, he was in full\nflight, discoursing on the connection between ideograms and nuclear phenomena,\nand predicting that the Chinese will eventually be more at home with non-\nEuclidean mathematics and physics than anybody else. Foshay predicted\nscepticism on the part of readers unless McLuhan gave his statements support\nand development.\n\nMcLuhan’s correspondence during the year that he worked on the NAEB project\nreflects his intense preoccupation with the ideas it was producing, ideas that\nwould find their way first into _GG_ and then into _Understanding Media_.\nMcLuhan wrote to David Riesman at Harvard about repeatability as the\nsubliminal message of print permeating Western thought since Gutenberg,\nnoting: “When the globe becomes a single electronic computer, with all its\nlanguages and cultures recorded on a single tribal drum, the fixed point of\nview of print culture becomes irrelevant and impossible, no matter how\nprecious.”[28](fm01.html#fm01en28a) With Peter Drucker he discussed the\ncontrast of emphasis between efficient causality under print technology and\nformal causality under electronic circuitry.[29](fm01.html#fm01en29a)\n\nMany of McLuhan’s correspondents during this period were persons he\ninterviewed in connection with his project, including Bernie Muller-Thym, to\nwhom McLuhan wrote about his new ideas as soon as they emerged. Among these\nwas the high-definition/low-definition contrast as a basic defining feature of\nmedia, presented to Muller-Thym through an illuminating illustration that\nmoved from country pedestrian to petrified metropolis as an example of the\nevolution of a single medium. McLuhan’s _principle of reversal_ , as a feature\nof both a medium’s behaviour and its effects, a cornerstone of his thought\nthrough to his final writings, is linked here, for the first time, to the\nhigh-definition/low-definition contrast. He was pleased to learn of\nindependent evidence from the field of fluid mechanics to support the\nprinciple. It was with Muller-Thym and Harry Skornia that McLuhan shared and\nexplored what he regarded as the major breakthroughs propelling him to the\noverview of media he developed as the NAEB report gelled first as _GG_ and\nthen as _Understanding Media_.\n\nIn correspondence with poet and English professor Wilfred Watson, his future\ncollaborator in writing _From Cliche to Archetype_, he stressed the engagement\nof artists with technology and opened questions relating to the scholarship of\nNorthrop Frye, questions he and Watson would pick up again in their book,\nquestions which emerge already in the pages of _GG_ : “The denuding of\nconscious life and its reduction to a single level created the new world of\nthe ‘unconscious’ in the seventeenth century. The stage has been cleared of\nthe archetypes or postures of individual mind, and is ready for the archetypes\nof the collective unconscious.” (_GG_ , 244)\n\nFor the benefit of impatient readers, McLuhan said plainly in the final\nversion of _Report on Project in Understanding the New Media_ that all his\nrecommendations could be reduced to one: “Study the modes of the media, in\norder to hoick all assumptions out of the subliminal, non-verbal realm for\nscrutiny and for prediction and control of human\npurposes.”[30](fm01.html#fm01en30a) The scrutiny in question is not far from\nthe critical method of inquiry that McLuhan learned at Cambridge from F.R.\nLeavis; it also recalls I.A. Richards’s lessons on context and purpose.\n\nThe report’s introduction identified human speech as a “master technology”;\nthis was a fundamental observation that inevitably made its way into\n_Understanding Media_ , though it featured less prominently there. McLuhan\nlauded the tradition of American linguistics, but found it too timid in its\napproach to technology, an opinion that emphasizes the inseparability of art\nand technology in McLuhan’s view. Just as semiotics was the context in which\nSaussure set linguistics, implicitly deferring the larger study until\nlinguistics had been more fully developed, media provided the context for the\nview of language that McLuhan had learned from Richards. Unlike Saussure, both\nRichards and McLuhan moved beyond the scope of their first inquiries to the\nbroader domains that beckoned. McLuhan evoked this parallel in only the\nsubtlest of ways in a section of his NAEB report titled “The New Criticism and\nthe New Media.”\n\nCompleting his year’s work, McLuhan put the finishing touches on his NAEB\nreport, sounding a note of evident satisfaction and giving a clear indication\nof where the future would take him: “Had Project 69 done nothing more than to\nisolate the fact the ‘content’ of any medium is another medium, it would have\njustified the expense involved many times over. Because, until this principle\nof ‘content’ as an illusion of media-mix is grasped, there is and will\ncontinue to be a futile effort to measure the transfer of content as if it\nwere some pellet moving from point to point like Zeno’s arrow. The ‘illusion’\nof content likewise syphons off all attention from the forms and effects of\nmedia.”[31](fm01.html#fm01en31a) McLuhan was the first to benefit from his\nresearch, as he made plain in a section of his report entitled “What I\nLearned.”\n\nArthur Wells Foshay and Harry Skornia were among McLuhan’s biggest supporters,\nencouraging him to continue the work he had started with the NAEB project.\nMcLuhan needed little encouragement. His findings were too absorbing to be\nleft in a report gathering dust on a shelf. He saw that big stakes were\ninvolved and wrote to Harry Skornia: “When all our senses are globally\nenveloping all our senses, you have an archetyped game or play situation [see\nreferences to _GG_ [page 244](ch02b.html#page_244) above] which ensures for\nthe whole of mankind the utmost possibilities of creativity ... I hope you\nwill feel that I am not letting the NAEB down nor above all your confidence in\nme in tackling this staggering concept.”[32](fm01.html#fm01en32a) Tackling the\nconcept meant he was now committed to pursue goals beyond addressing hidebound\neducators. This he did, first in _GG_ and soon after in _Understanding Media_.\n\nThough the mosaic format of _GG_ with its multiple points of view creates an\nintellectual energy that surges into a hundred different channels, the book\nfocuses on one question: What sort of changes did the media of the printing\npress and movable type bring about? It meant the end of manuscript culture, to\nbe sure, but the consequences were much more far-reaching than the loss of\njobs for scribes and monks. Printing was the mechanization of writing. It\npromoted nationalism and national languages because international Latin did\nnot have enough scope to provide markets for the printers. Print also fostered\na sense of private identity (by making copies available to individual readers\nin such large numbers) and imposed a level of standardization in language that\nhad not prevailed until then, thus making “correct” spelling and grammar a\nmeasure of literacy.\n\nPrint culture intensified the effects of the older technology of writing.\nBefore writing, mankind lived in acoustic space, the space of the spoken word,\nwhich is boundless, directionless, horizonless, and charged with emotion.\nWriting transformed space into something bounded, linear, ordered, structured,\nand rational. The written page, with its edges, margins, and sharply defined\nletters in row after row, inevitably brought in a new way of thinking about\nspace.\n\nMedia effects did not end when Gutenberg’s invention transformed writing into\nprint. Whereas print had mechanized writing, four centuries later the\ntelegraph electrified it. But McLuhan teaches that new media do not so much\nreplace each other as complicate each other. It is this interaction that\nobscures their effects. The technology of mankind in the age of acoustic\nspace, the technology from which writing, print, and telegraph developed, was\nspeech. Transformed into writing, speech lost the quality that made it part of\nthe culture of acoustic space. It acquired a powerful visual bias, producing\neffects in social and cultural organization that endure to the present. But\nthere was also a loss, in that writing separated speech from the other\nphysical senses. The powerful extension of speech permitted by the development\nof radio produced a similar loss, for this medium reduced speech to one sense\n– the aural. Radio is not speech (because we only listen), but it creates the\nillusion, like writing, of containing speech.\n\nThe all-at-onceness of the stories on a newspaper page contrasts with the one-\nat-a-timeness of ideas developed in a book. The significance of this contrast\nfor McLuhan is the effect it produced: artists like Joyce and Picasso saw\nbeyond the superficial chaos of the newspaper page to a higher order of\nharmony. The apparent dislocations that mark the work of these artists are\nparalleled by the discontinuities that form the basis of quantum physics and\nrelativity theory. In the social sciences, McLuhan detects further parallels\nin the approaches to history and culture to be found in the writings of Arnold\nToynbee and Margaret Mead, where again all-at-onceness replaces one-at-a-\ntimeness.\n\nSuch reorganization of perception bewilders those who cling to the comfort of\nthe older, linear order of things and a (single) “practical” point of view. In\n_The Mechanical Bride_ McLuhan had issued a challenge to readers to become as\naware of new environments as they are of getting into a bath: “The inside\npoint of view would coincide with the practical point of view of the man who\nwould rather eat the turtle than admire the design on its back. The same man\nwould rather dunk himself in the newspaper than have any esthetic or\nintellectual grasp of its character and meaning.”[33](fm01.html#fm01en33a)\nStepping into a newspaper is inevitable; perceiving it as an environment is\nindispensable to understanding its power and its effect.\n\nThe phonetic alphabet is medium par excellence – medium as extension _and_ in\nthe basic sense of in-between or go-between. As a result, it has subtle but\npowerful consequences. What does the alphabet mediate? Meaning and sound.\nCompare Chinese characters, where there is no representation of sound in the\nvisual symbols, no component parts used in different combinations to show how\nthose combinations are pronounced. Here the symbol is a whole, a unit. It\ncarries its meaning as a whole, not as a sequence of elements. In alphabetic\nwriting, there _is_ a sequence, but its parts (letters) _and_ the sounds they\nstand for are meaningless in themselves. Meaning only attaches to complete\nsequences.\n\nBefore the invention of the alphabet, communication among humans involved the\nsimultaneous use of senses, speaking being accompanied by gestures and\nrequiring both listening and looking. The immediacy and rich complexity of\nthis type of communication was reduced by the alphabet to an abstract visual\ncode. This is part of McLuhan’s teaching on the transition from the culture of\nacoustic space to that of rational space brought about by the invention of the\nalphabet. To this he adds two points: (1) the transition involves a shift away\nfrom tribal society to a society composed of individuals with private\nidentities and capable of pursuing private goals; (2) the transition is a one-\nway process. This last point means that since alphabetization is a reductive\nprocess, a non-alphabetic culture cannot assimilate it; non-alphabetic culture\ncan only be assimilated by alphebetization.\n\nGG was, in Harry Skornia’s words, “not really a book in the usual\norganizational or formal sense. It only looks like a book. And since Marshall\nhas to try to use the print medium, the book, to try to convey and illustrate\nnon-print revelations, he is bound to be trapped into several approximations,\nexaggerations, and oversimplifications and apparent contradictions. The\nflashing lights, which GALAXY is, cannot be expected to have the\ncharacteristics of a steadily glowing headlight that can be traced back to its\nsource, crossed and recrossed, sampled and analysed.”[34](fm01.html#fm01en34a)\nSkornia understood that McLuhan’s objective was to transform the hot medium of\nprint into the cool medium of dialogue.\n\nRecalling his encounters with McLuhan as they consulted on the NAEB project,\nSkornia said: “When I used to preside at meetings at which he spoke, I used to\nsay, there should be a switch on him so I could turn him off, translate and\ndiscuss, and then turn him back on after we slow pokes had gotten the\npoint.”[35](fm01.html#fm01en35a) He was prepared to take _The Gutenberg\nGalaxy_ and its author on their own terms: “In any criticism or analysis of\nMarshall, we miss the point if we quibble over whether he means ‘the mosaic is\nTHE ONLY way to reveal ... etc ...’ or whether, on reflection, he may not mean\nthat the mosaic analogy is a convenient and useful one. He can’t be bothered\nwith details like that.”[36](fm01.html#fm01en36a)\n\nOther critics were not so magnanimous. Conceding the validity of McLuhan’s\nview of media as shapers of mankind, Arthur Efron charged that McLuhan’s\nmosaic approach had not achieved its objective of abolishing point of view:\n“[McLuhan] instead introduces it in his spoken and unspoken assumptions\n...”[37](fm01.html#fm01en37a) Efron buttressed _his_ point of view by invoking\nmisconceptions about the Renaissance that McLuhan had outlined twenty years\nearlier in his dissertation on Thomas Nashe.[38](fm01.html#fm01en38a) Efron\nconcluded: “In my mind _The Mechanical Bride_ is a great work of cultural\nillumination, but _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ is finally a reversion to a\nneoclassical or neoscholastic daydream.”[39](fm01.html#fm01en39a)\n\nSuch views did not disturb McLuhan, who wrote to Walter Ong: “My theory is\nonly acceptable to Thomists, for whom consciousness as analogical proportion\namong the senses from moment to moment, is quite easy to grasp. But print\ntechnology actually smashes that analogical awareness in society and the\nindividual ... A _sensus communis_ for external senses is what I’m trying to\nbuild.”[40](fm01.html#fm01en40a) “I’m not concerned to get any kudos out of\nthis book,” McLuhan said of _GG_ , adding: “It seems to me a book that\nsomebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else _had_ written\nit.”[41](fm01.html#fm01en41a)\n\nBut the kudos came – and in the form of the 1963 Governor General’s Award for\ncritical prose. McLuhan had not expected it. Nor did he know who, as chairman\nof the selection committee, had locked himself up with colleagues in an Ottawa\nhotel room, persuading them that the award should go to Canada’s emerging\nauthority on media. It was none other than Northrop Frye.\n\nFor all his support, Frye showed no reticence in offering criticism of\nMcLuhan, which was marked by some of the misunderstandings common to early\nreviewers of _GG_ and many other commentators on McLuhan’s work up to the\npresent. Frye’s criticisms were pointed and broad-ranging, jabbing even at\nMcLuhan’s commitment to rhetoric, and perhaps subtly discounting the value of\nthe inspiration that he had drawn from Harold Innis:\n\nThe role of communications media in the modern world is a subject that\nProfessor Marshall McLuhan has made so much his own that it would be almost a\ndiscourtesy not to refer to him in a lecture which covers many of his themes.\nThe McLuhan cult, or more accurately the McLuhan rumor, is the latest of the\nillusions of progress: it tells us that a number of new media are about to\nbring in a new form of civilization all by themselves, merely by existing.\nBecause of this we should not, in staring at a television set, wonder if we\nare wasting our time and develop guilt feelings accordingly: we should feel\nthat we are evolving a new mode of apprehension. What is important about the\ntelevision set is not the quality it exudes, which is only content, but the\nfact that it is there, the end of a vortical suction that ‘involves’ the\nviewer. This is not all of what a serious and most original writer is trying\nto say, yet Professor McLuhan lends himself partly to this interpretation by\nthrowing so many of his insights into a deterministic form. He would connect\nthe alienation of progress with the habit of forcing a hypnotized eye to\ntravel over thousands of miles of type, in what is so accurately called the\npursuit of knowledge. But apparently he would see the Gutenberg syndrome as a\ncause of the alienation of progress, and not simply as one of its effects.\nDeterminism of this kind, like the determinism which derives Confederation\nfrom the railway, is a plausible but oversimplified form of\nrhetoric.[42](fm01.html#fm01en42a)\n\nIf McLuhan’s ideas are better understood today than they were when supporting\nevidence for them was less apparent, misunderstandings have persisted. An\ninterviewer, exasperated with McLuhan’s way of thinking, once asked him how a\nbook could be a technology, exploding then with “It’s too small!” Apparently\nthe besotted interviewer had never heard of microchips, which are all\nsubstantially smaller than even really small books but definitely qualify as\ntechnology. How could the size of a thing be the crucial factor for qualifying\nit as a _technology_? (The interviewer in question must have been thinking of\nthose first-generation computers that were the size of rooms.)\n\nA technology, any technology, any medium, for McLuhan, is something that\nextends one or more of our five physical senses. The book is a form of print,\nis a form of writing, is a visual form of the voice giving expression to\nideas, which is where the chain of media working in pairs ends. Ideas don’t\nhang around by themselves. Unless they are uttered (outered, ushered out) from\nour brains and into our mouths with the help of lungs and teeth and other\nhuman-body sound-production equipment, they are unknown to anyone but\nourselves and unknown even to ourselves, unless we have learned their\nouterings through the conventional signs of a language. Here we are back to\nmedia working in pairs, and technology in the McLuhan sense, and size does\n_not_ matter.\n\nA reviewer of Sven Birkerts’s _The Gutenberg Elegies_ (1994) declared the book\nto be “every bit as alarming and thought-provoking as the cultural meditations\nof Marshall McLuhan” (on the jacket blurb), and although Birkerts’s discussion\nranges over thinkers who are often assimilated to McLuhan, from Neil Postman\nto Don DeLillo, and although Birkerts comes close to privileging James Joyce\nas much as McLuhan does, he gives few direct references. There is also at\nleast an implicit (and baffling) suggestion that Birkerts is concerned with\nthe philosophical implications of technological changes, whereas McLuhan was\nnot.\n\nIn _How Images Think_ (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2004), Ron Burnett states:\n“Clearly information transmission depends on the medium in use, and in that\nnarrow sense, the medium is the message. In all of this the issues of content\nand semantics seem to disappear. McLuhan’s popularization of the medium is the\nmessage has had a negative impact and overdetermined impact on the cultural\nunderstanding of communications technologies” (163). Burnett too has missed a\nfundamental point in McLuhan’s thinking, for he never said the medium is the\nmessage _in the narrow sense_. On the contrary, he was always stretching\nmeanings. Content and semantics do not disappear in McLuhan’s perspective, but\nthere is a fundamental distinction to be made, in his view, between the\nsimple, uncontroversial, and unproblematic sense of _content_ (information in\nthe conventional sense of data and its transmission) and the sense of\n_message_ as social impact of a medium.\n\nEarly in his career, Marshall McLuhan grew concerned about mankind moving into\nthe twenty-first century with nineteenth-century perceptions. This became his\nprimary motivation for writing _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ and for grounding all\nhis subsequent teaching and writing in the precepts that it sets out. McLuhan\ncould cherish the values of literate culture, in spite of the “spliteracy”\ninduced by the invention of moveable type; reading _Galaxy_ provides a unique\nstarting point for discovering what might be cherished in the electronic\ngalaxy, when it is understood in the framework McLuhan provides.\n\n### Notes\n\n[1](fm01.html#fm01en1) Matie Molinaro, Corinne McLuhan, William Toye, eds.,\n_Letters of Marshall McLuhan_ (henceforth _Letters_) (Toronto: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1987), 231–2.

McLuhan’s _Little Point_**\n\nIn Henry James’s novella _The Figure in the Carpet_ , Hugh Vereker, a renowned\nwriter, tells the narrator (himself a writer who has just published a review\nof Vereker’s last novel) that all his critics have missed his “little point”:\n“By my little point I mean – what shall I call it? – the particular thing I’ve\nwritten my books most FOR. Isn’t there for every writer a particular thing of\nthat sort, the thing that most makes him apply himself, the thing without the\neffort to achieve which he wouldn’t write at all, the very passion of his\npassion, the part of the business in which, for him, the flame of art burns\nmost intensely? Well, it’s THAT!”[1](fm02.html#fm02en1a) The “thing for the\ncritic to find,” insists Vereker, is “like a complex figure in a Persian\ncarpet,” but he firmly refuses to tell the puzzled narrator what that figure\nlooks like: he has to find it for himself. Tormented by the new challenge, the\nnarrator starts his own search to no avail; he shares this puzzle with his\nfriend George Corvick who, instead, solves the mystery during a long trip to\nIndia and wires his fiancée, Gwendolyne, “Eureka. Immense,” without saying\n“what it is.” His secret discovery will be revealed only to Gwendolyne after\nthey marry; a secret that Gwendolyne herself will preserve after her husband’s\npremature death. Neither her second husband nor the narrator will ever be told\n“what it is,” and they will both be left with their suspended curiosity after\nGwendolyne’s own death.\n\nIn 1996, when reading _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ for the first time, I felt like\nthe narrator in James’s novella: it was an unusual, fascinating book, though I\ncould not _understand_ most of it, it nevertheless _resounded through_ me. The\nmore I read it, the more it echoed in my mind: I knew that there was something\n“particular” in McLuhan’s writing, but I continued to miss his “little point,”\nI could not see his “figure in the carpet.” It was only several weeks later,\nwhile reading _The Interior Landscape: The Literary Criticism of Marshall\nMcLuhan_ ,[2](fm02.html#fm02en2a) that I could shift to George Corvick’s\nperspective and say: “Eureka. Immense.” Reading McLuhan’s literary criticism\nnot only helped me to better understand the work of my favourite modernist\nmasters (James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound are among those discussed in\nthat book), but it also helped me to better understand “what IT was” in _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ : while reading their fiction and poetry, McLuhan had also\nstarted to read _through_ the modernists’ experiments with language and form;\nhe had, in fact, _put them on_. He had so fully grasped their literary\nimplications that he had used them to elaborate his own “particular thing,”\nhis own form of writing: the _mosaic_. Well, it’s _THAT_!\n\nWhen reading McLuhan, _form_ is as important as _content_ , just as it is when\nwe read Joyce, Pound, Lewis, or Eliot. Translating THAT into McLuhanese we\ncould say that **THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE**. As a literary and a modernist\nscholar, for me it was a true epiphany to better understand McLuhan’s form of\nwriting, and through that, to better appreciate his teachings on literature as\nwell as on “media as environment”; it was an even greater epiphany to realize\nthat those same teachings had solid roots in his humanistic background. It is\nas simple as that, but it is often neglected or dismissed as a _semantic\nleitmotif_ or a _semantic cliché_ when acknowledging McLuhan’s years at\nCambridge University, UK, in the 1930s.[3](fm02.html#fm02en3a) We assume that\nhe was a well-read man of letters, but we tend to overlook what that implies\nand how that shaped his way of being a media scholar. After all, McLuhan\nhimself used to repeat that “**WATER IS UNKNOWN TO A FISH UNTIL IT DISCOVERS\nAIR**.”\n\nLiterature and the arts constitute a sort of constant _fil rouge_ , a constant\nunspooling thread, connecting in time McLuhan’s media explorations; they are\nnot used as decorative elements of his grand narrative on media but are,\ninstead, a structural component of Marshall McLuhan’s original “poetics.” _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ is the perfect case in point: the Homeric tradition is\nquoted at the very beginning of the prologue to discuss the interplay of\ncontrasted cultures, and the works of Milman Parry and Albert B. Lord are\nturned into the underpinning subtexts guiding readers on how the Western world\nshifted from orality to literacy first, then from literacy to post-literacy.\nFollowing a similar pattern, the first chapter begins with a discussion of\nShakespeare’s _King Lear_ to epitomize the making of Gutenberg’s “fragmented\nman”; the same book, _King Lear_ , is then used in the following chapters as a\n“working model” enlightening on cultural processes. And many other literary\ntexts are quoted all through _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ with the same intent.\nConsistently, the very last chapter – “The Galaxy Reconfigured” – ends with a\ntremendous literary phantasmagoria which evolves into an imaginative\n_progression d’effet_ as the reader is asked to confront as many diverse\nwriters as: Blake, Pope, Ruskin, Rimbaud, Proust, Joyce, Mallarme, Coleridge,\nDryden, Swift, Addison, Steele, Dr Johnson, Poe, Baudelaire, Valéry, Eliot.\nEven the very last paragraph of that very last chapter can be read in the\nlight of a very popular literary tradition, that of the serial novel, as\nMcLuhan introduces an idea which he promises to further discuss in another\nvolume. He tells his readers that his story is to be continued and even\nannounces the title of the next instalment of his “saga”: _Understanding\nMedia_ ,[4](fm02.html#fm02en4a) which in fact would be published two years\nlater. Literature is therefore functional to the construction of McLuhan’s\ninvestigative strategy _and_ storytelling, and _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ embeds\nan idea that McLuhan had expressed to Walter J. Ong in a letter written as\nearly as 1946: “literature is not a subject but _a function_ – a function\ninseparable from communal existence.”[5](fm02.html#fm02en5a) In other words,\nnot only literature matters but it can also become a key to understand our own\nworld: “After a conventional and devoted initiation to poetry as a romantic\nrebellion against mechanical industry and bureaucratic stupidity, Cambridge\nwas a shock. Richards, Leavis, Eliot and Pound and Joyce in a few weeks opened\nthe doors of perception on the poetic process, and its role in adjusting the\nreader to the contemporary world. _My study of media began and remains rooted\nin the work of these men_.”[6](fm02.html#fm02en6a) Literature is therefore the\nfundamental component of McLuhan’s original _poetics_. My own understanding of\nthe term _poetics_ follows Umberto Eco’s definition: poetics is perceived as\nthe _operative project_ which pervades a specific work and that leads to a\ngiven _form_ , at once “original” and “traditional,” that is linked to other\npre-existing forms.[7](fm02.html#fm02en7a) Moving forward from this\ndefinition, Marshall McLuhan’s poetics is far more complex than normally\nrecognized, especially as far as _form_ is concerned. Whereas his operative\nproject is well known – to investigate the impact of new media on human\nconsciousness and environment, so as to foresee, reveal, and eventually\ncounterbalance the related side effects – the _form_, which shapes and gives\nnew functional potential to such a project, is still underestimated. Not only\nis McLuhan’s writing discontinuous, but as said, it also is pervaded by\ncountless literary references and _exempla_ derived from different artistic\nexpressions. By reading his media analysis and investigations, the reader\nperceives that literature and the arts are playing a pivotal role in the\nshaping of McLuhan’s writing technique, but how that happens and for what\npurpose might not be immediately clear. To appreciate that, we have to\nremember that Marshall McLuhan portrayed himself as an _explorer_ and not as\nan _explainer_ of media environments. “Mosaic” or “field approach” are the\nterms McLuhan himself employed to define these explorations; and “mosaic” was\nalso his way of rendering them.\n\n### **\n\nMarshall McLuhan’s Mosaic: A Different Approach to Knowledge and Reality**\n\nMarshall McLuhan introduces his idea of “mosaic” in the very first lines of\n_Gutenberg Galaxy_ ; he places it before his prologue to warn his readers that\nthe book they are about to read is somehow “different” and that the difference\nis not only in _what_ is discussed but also in _how_ that is done: “ _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ develops a mosaic or field approach to its problems. Such a\nmosaic image of numerous data and quotations in evidence offers the only\npractical means of revealing causal operations in\nhistory.”[8](fm02.html#fm02en8a) Expanding that definition, we can consider\nMcLuhan’s mosaic _an operative tool stemming from the humanities_ (McLuhan’s\nown understanding of literature as “a function”) _and steering media\nactuality_ (by showing the interplay of technology and culture).\n\nWhat is, in fact, a mosaic? If you think of it, we can associate different\nmeanings to this term: the mosaic can be an art form (the Roman mosaics, or\nthe Byzantine mosaics), or a multicultural approach to societal and cultural\nphenomena (the Canadian mosaic), or a type of pavement (a mosaic floor). These\nare just a few basic examples pertaining to different domains: the artistic or\nthe aesthetic one, the sociocultural and the political one, the most pragmatic\none of construction and applied design. And yet, if you think of it, they all\nhave something in common: their operative structure. All these ideas of mosaic\nin fact translate into a material or conceptual form based on fragments – or\ntiles, or tesserae – that is, discrete units whose assemblage creates a figure\nwhich acquires meaning _through the interplay with its own ground_. By so\ndoing, a pattern gets created and in turn revealed through our active\nobservation. _Pattern recognition_ is the way we approach all mosaics: we look\nfor the overall design that the careful assemblage of the various tesserae\nbrings to light, something which transcends their mere sum. Pattern\nrecognition engages us, requires our will to cooperate with the structure; it\nturns us into Sherlock Holmes, capable of seeing the narrative of a Roman or a\nByzantine mosaic, as well as of a multicultural one, or even of a mosaic\nfloor. _We participate in the process of giving meaning to what we\nexperience_. This is true for all what we define as _a mosaic_ , including\nMcLuhan’s form of writing: it is a form which encourages an active\nparticipation of all seers, readers, spectators who have to find _the figure\nin the carpet_ , which is, in fact, what connects figures and ground.\n\nAs _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ clearly shows, McLuhan’s mosaic is therefore a non-\nlinear form of writing which re-elaborates the alphabetic form so to give the\nwritten page a tactile and multi-sensorial dimension. Just like in modernist\navant-garde experiments, McLuhan designed a page which no longer assimilated “\n_utterance to the human body_ ,” a metaphor which returns us to a well-known\nentity.[9](fm02.html#fm02en9a) McLuhan’s pages lost the head (no titles but\n“chapter glosses”) and the feet (no footnotes, all references are within the\ntext); they lost their traditional “physicality,” at the same time that the\nnew “discarnate human beings” of the electric age were losing their sense of\nbody by extending their psyches into cyberspace. After having defined the\n“individual” as a “**MONTAGE OF LOOSELY ASSEMBLED PARTS** ” McLuhan had fun in\ndisassembling those very parts because “**WHEN YOU ARE ON THE PHONE OR ON THE\nAIR YOU HAVE NO BODY**.” The point for us is how to remain “somebody” while\nhaving “no body.” By encouraging our active participation in the process of\ndiscovery, McLuhan’s mosaic also contributes to alert us and to keep us awake;\nby engaging with both the mosaic and its complex network of subtexts, we are\ntrained to be _conscious readers_ and not numbed or homogenized _nobodies_.\n\n### **McLuhan’s Mosaic:_Verbo-vocal-visual_ Potentialities of His _Probes_**\n\nActing at the forefront of new technological revolutions, McLuhan’s mosaic\ndeveloped from a different metaphor, no longer a biological one (our body),\nbut a technological one: the _probe_ , a flexible object through which we can\ncarry out explorations not only outside but also inside different bodies. The\nprobe constitutes the functional tile of McLuhan’s mosaic; it is the smaller\nunit which is assembled to convey a pattern, to turn the fixity of the printed\npage into an acoustic experience. Pages written around probes incorporate\nreaders into the text’s landscape; readers of the mosaic are no longer\nexternal observers, they are inside the evolving picture. This means that\nreaders do not have to approach McLuhan’s printed page as _a thing_ , but\nrather as _an event_ in which the act of reading is integral to a\nparticipation in the process of discovery.\n\nFrom the late sixties, the hippie youth movement got and celebrated McLuhan’s\nform of communication better than other audiences, the idea of “happening”\nbeing at the core of their life philosophy. Needless to say, the appreciation\ncoming from the countercultures of the young rebels did not contribute to the\nappreciation of McLuhan’s scholarly work, nor did Yoko Ono and John Lennon’s\nvisits to McLuhan’s Coach House in Toronto: it was the confirmation that\nMcLuhan was but a _media guru_ , a _techno fan_ who made money out of the\n_love &peace_ world. Certainly, he did not foster his cause as a professor of\nEnglish by proclaiming that “**COMPUTERS ARE THE LSD OF THE CORPORATE WORLD**\n” or that “**THE NEW TOURISTS ARE THE INNER TRIPPERS** ,” thinking of the side\neffects of then new media such as TV, but only because his readers _did not\nput him on_ as well. If you free these so-called slogans from the tyranny of\n_literate_ words, you will appreciate them as interactive probes connecting us\nto a broader network of concepts. McLuhan’s probes are in fact USB flash\ndrives interfacing us and the broken knowledge in his texts: they are verbo-\nvocal-visual devices which triggers sensorial synaesthesia in the way we\nperceive and inhabit our inner and outer landscapes.\n\nThe density of the probe, its aphoristic and paratactic structure, as well as\nits connection to the paradoxical aim to counterbalance its brevity by\nencouraging a deeper and more engaging investigation. It is not by chance that\nMcLuhan also called these probes _glosses_ – as in _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ –\ntherefore employing a term used in biblical exegesis to explain passages in\nthe text; a term which was also used to indicate marginal notes in manuscripts\nand printed versions of texts both in the classic and the vulgar tradition. A\n_probe_ or _gloss_ is a dynamic rhetorical device envisaged as a textual\naddition that creates a series of related patterns of knowledge inside and\noutside the text itself. If readers read _through_ the probe – that is, if\nthey see it as a window opening on a broader (textual and contextual)\nlandscape – they read _in depth_ , investigating and discussing possible\nmeanings, links, and further implications. If they skip from a probe to the\nnext one quickly, they can just have fun and use the mosaic as a form of\namusing diversion which, nevertheless, can induce unexpected associations and,\nin time, even understanding and knowledge. After all, humour was a favourite\ntenet of McLuhan’s form of communication.\n\nHence, to my mind, the _probe_ or _gloss_ constitutes the fundamental\ncomponent of McLuhan’s mosaic. The probe is used to convey a broken knowledge\nas in the aphoristic tradition; even if it often sounds like a formula, it\nforces you to become an active player. The probe is in effect McLuhan’s\nrhetorical device aimed at triggering intertextuality and operating as a link\nto other textual and contextual situations. As you will discover when reading\n_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , each probe introduces a set of apparently unrelated\nquestions, which are often conveyed in a paradoxical – and therefore\nprovocative – way and which readers are asked to explore. In time, McLuhan\ndeveloped different types of probes, moving from traditional aphorisms to\nparatactic constructions involving also images but the function of the probe\nor gloss remains the same: to provoke and engage the readers and encourage a\ndifferent approach to situations by turning them into “active players”\ninterfacing a substantial discontinuity.\n\nEven though the questions placed at the beginning of each of the forty-nine\nchapters of McLuhan’s first published book, _The Mechanical Bride_\n(1951),[10](fm02.html#fm02en10a) can be approached as first versions of\n“probes” or “glosses,” it is in _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ that the probe becomes\na clearly conceived structural element of McLuhan’s prose. Here is an example\nof one of McLuhan’s probes/glosses – or even “one-image poems” – from _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_. You do not have to read it. You have _to experience it_ ,\nthat is, to read _through it_ :\n\n### **Civilization gives\n\nthe barbarian or tribal man an eye for an ear and is now at odds with the\nelectric world**\n\nIf you read through it, you find yourself digging out an idea that explores\nthe historical interface of orality and literacy through time. This probe\nimmediately renders the cyclic vision of human history, as expressed by\nMcLuhan himself in his grand narrative on media. Here, he retrieves the\nmetaphorical structure of language and plays with it. The terms _barbarian or\ntribal man_ , _civilization_ , _electric world_ immediately evoke three\ndifferent social constructs; they imply three different relationships between\nthe individual and the environment, also denoting a different sensorial order.\nHere in one fell swoop is: the world _before_ the invention of the phonetic\nalphabet; the world _after_ the phonetic alphabet and printing press; the\nworld _after_ the commercialization of electricity. The passage from _ear_ to\n_eye_ indicates the passage from the ancient acoustic mode of perception –\ninclusive and simultaneous – typical of tribal society to a sequential and\nlinear one pertaining to the literate Western society, now obsolete or no\nlonger adequate to (_at odds with_) the electric environment (which, through\nits retribalization, is rediscovering acoustic and tribal dynamics). This\nprobe (as all the others) can therefore be figured out in depth, and used as a\nway to access a more complex ground. In a similar way, all other probes\nencapsulate knowledge that readers are asked to retrieve.\n\nLike most modernist writings, McLuhan’s writing is an _open writing_ , a sort\nof _writing in progress_ which acquires new and different meanings depending\non the act of reading and therefore depending on the readers, who are\ntherefore transformed into co-producers of meaning. McLuhan defined this\nprocess of continuous interplay and exegesis as a “**do-it-yourself\nparticipation on the part of the reader**.” He freed word from the tyranny of\nthe School of Paris and took it back to the School of Athens; he retrieved the\n‘evocative power’ of words, and their potentialities to combine through a\nknowledge broken so to open all doors of perception. As a grammarian of the\nelectric age, McLuhan insisted that “**LANGUAGE DOES FOR INTELLIGENCE WHAT THE\nWHEEL DOES FOR THE FEET AND THE BODY**.” Language is in fact a key term when\napproaching McLuhan. And literature, which he studied, can be approached as\nthe gathering of texts that form the matrix of languages.\n\n### **The Mosaic: Hyper _text_ or Hyper _language_?**\n\nMcLuhan’s probes or glosses are built upon an artist-like use of imagination,\nintuition and language; however, starting with _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ he\napplied them with a probing (and playful) attitude to all cognitive fields, to\nall forms of knowledge, to all media (generally taken as both products and\nextensions of man and of his faculties). As Derrick de Kerckhove has pointed\nout, McLuhan explored “an area of knowledge usually reserved to human sciences\nthrough artistic methods and through the articulation of\nlanguage.”[11](fm02.html#fm02en11a) It is exactly _the articulation of\nlanguage_ which is important in McLuhan’s mosaic. In this context, language is\nto be understood as an _arché_ unifying _forma et substancia_ (literally\n_form_ and _substance_), thus becoming the cognitive agent which shaped his\noriginal aphoristic style, at once combining an ancient knowledge with avant-\ngarde formal experiments. McLuhan was a humanist acting inside the electric\nage, pursuing an eclectic approach to knowledge and actuality, collecting\nmaterials from various fields and cultural languages; his holistic and\ninclusive approach to mobile situations (often dismissed as trivial\ngenerality) aimed to reveal new social patterns, that is, to point to the\nvarious larger figures in the carpet. Consistently, his form of communication,\nas well as his “field approach to situations,” was _humanistic_ , at once\n_eclectic_ and _electric_ : he borrowed from literary and artistic traditions\nand elaborated his findings into an original discourse whose fuzzy syntax\npuzzled those who could not chew on his aphorisms.\n\nWhen McLuhan was “rediscovered” after a decade of oblivion following his\ndeath, he was immediately turned into the patron saint of the world of\ninformation and communication technology. In a short span of time, his\noracular pronouncements were read instead as prophetical messages and he was\nresurrected as the great guru of the media-geeks tribe. It is true that\nMcLuhan did anticipate future developments of information and communication\ntechnology with uncanny precision. He did not envision the production of the\nBlackBerry, iPod, or iPhone, but he imagined their technological effects and\nanticipated the environmental side effects of the digital and interactive\ntechnologies which we now manage daily. But, alas, if you take time to read\nhis books, or to watch his video interviews you will immediately realize that\nMcLuhan himself was the first to remind his audiences that he had carefully\npredicted only what had already happened! Yes, it is a witty and paradoxical\nstatement, but with the paradox comes the serious revelation derived from the\nhumanistic philosophical traditions: the effect always precedes the formal\ncause, so much so that the future can only be an invention of the past. This\nparadox invites us to reconsider a technological metaphor that is often\napplied to McLuhan’s own form of communication; as a matter of fact, the\nmosaic is too readily defined as a hypertext _ante-litteram_. By doing this we\ntranslate what is perhaps a more complex form into what we immediately\nunderstand and associate today with interactivity and multimedia\ncommunications. But isn’t such a comparison a cliché that limits a real\nunderstanding of the way in which the mosaic interfaces with readers,\nknowledge, and actuality? Following a brilliant essay by Michel A.\nMoos,[12](fm02.html#fm02en12a) I am more inclined to approach McLuhan’s mosaic\nas a hyper _language_ discussing new technologies _through the humanities_.\n\nGenerally speaking, all definitions seem to converge on the idea that, in\npractice, hypertext is an updated version of Bush’s _memex_ – a neologism\ncombining the ideas of memory and index – a device conceptualized as early as\n1945.[13](fm02.html#fm02en13a) However, if it had been presented to King\nThamus as a gift to improve our memory or thought, quite certainly the _memex_\nwould have prompted the same judgment that he pronounced when Theuth\nintroduced the invention of writing to him. This episode, originally recalled\nby Plato in his _Phaedrus_ , is by now a classic in communication studies and\nit is often quoted to epitomize the way people tend to look at the pointing\nfinger and not at the moon beyond it. As you might remember, Theuth, a famous\ngod and inventor of Naucratis in Egypt, showed several of his inventions to\nthe god Thamus, “the king of the whole country of Egypt”; while so doing, he\nenumerated the advantages that each of them would bring to their people. When\nhe came to literacy, “the letters,” Theuth praised that invention as capable\nto enhance people’s memory and therefore wit. Thamus surprised him by replying\nthat, instead, writing was nothing but a means to trigger forgetfulness to the\ndetriment of real wisdom and knowledge. Since “the parent or inventor of an\nart is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own\ninventions to the users of them,”[14](fm02.html#fm02en14a) Thamus showed\nTheuth the full moon beyond his finger. From that moment, Thamus warned\nTheuth, people would instead become more and more ignorant, relying on writing\nto bring things to their remembrance through external signs. People would lose\nthe capability to look through things, to participate in the process of\nlearning; they would have “the show of wisdom without the reality.” If my\nparallel stands, then the _memex_ is to memory as writing is to orality. The\npoint now is to decide if McLuhan’s probes and mosaic relate more to writing\nand memex or to memory and orality. My idea is that, being verbo-vocal-visual\n“tools,” the probes and the mosaic _substance_ is closer to the latter pair,\neven though their _function_ might recall the one offered by “links” in\nhypertexts.\n\nIn his essay, Moos considers McLuhan’s probes or glosses as adapter cables\nwhich activate interfacing, juxtaposing different media on what stays as a\n“text-based operating system.”[15](fm02.html#fm02en15a) The form “book” is\nrenewed through the contact with “the diverse and discontinuous life forms,”\nat the same time revealing a new exploratory technique: “[McLuhan] shows you\nhow you can take the low-tech interface of the page and reverse engineer it so\nit can handle other inputs, so that you can, in effect, plug other media into\nit.”[16](fm02.html#fm02en16a) McLuhan’s mosaic is an inclusive and\nsimultaneous form of writing which “optimizes language on the page with better\ncompression techniques, enlarged memory storage, and enhances program\nlogic”;[17](fm02.html#fm02en17a) it overcomes linearity and opens the phonetic\nform to new potentialities.\n\nThe form of McLuhan’s mosaic is born out of the meeting of orality and\nliteracy, and the resulting extraordinary intensity snaps us out of the\nNarcissus-narcosis imposed on our senses by the mechanicity of literacy. This\nform certainly anticipates later forms of communication, such as hypertext;\nalso, it certainly shares similar tenets to hypertext itself in structure\n(i.e., the analogical combination of probes and textual fragments) and in\nmodes of fruitions (i.e., the possibility to freely move backward and forward\ninside the text). But as a _form_ it is meaningfully different because it is\nrooted in the ancient liberal art of _grammar_. This is something that today\nhypertext does not necessarily imply. What this grounding implies is an\napproach to knowledge based on “the art of exposition and interpretation of\nphenomena”[18](fm02.html#fm02en18a) rather than a compartmentalized take on\nconcepts and ideas which are then assembled in hypertextual modes.\n\nMcLuhan’s mosaic is primarily a tool enhancing our capability to learn and\napprehend through the interplay of ancient wisdom and cognitive stimulation;\nit is not simply a way to convey simultaneity and dress knowledge in a format\nemploying different media models in order to offer a more _lively_ , _real_ ,\nand _immediate_ experience. It is not, so to speak, the embodiment of the\nmedia fan but of the media grammarian. The mosaic relies on the witty power of\npuns and words to perceive analogies between apparently unrelated things. It\nopens windows to unpack all the _compressed_ learning embedded in language:\nquoting Bacon and his nineteenth-century commentators, Moos rightly recalls\nthe concept of _portability of thought_ based on “an internal mobility of\nlanguage through which thought itself advances.”[19](fm02.html#fm02en19a) Such\na concept is also assessed in relation to McLuhan’s own study of H.A. Innis’s\nlanguage, where McLuhan defines each of Innis’s sentences as a compressed\nmonograph: “He includes a small library on each page, and often incorporates a\nsmall library of references on the same page in\naddition.”[20](fm02.html#fm02en20a) Consequently, reading becomes an active\nprocess not simply because it enables us to understand what is written in the\nbook and to participate in the creation of meaning, but mostly because it\nencourages us to continue exploring, and if we fully engage in that form it\nwill further foster knowledge. As Moos insightfully suggests, McLuhan’s\nwriting (as well as Innis’s) does not anticipate hypertext as a database that\nwe can access, but as “a mode of thinking that reaches back into your own\n‘headset’ and accesses you.” The mosaic taps “into the reader, to access and\nactivate his inner storehouse”: “The effect is to enable those very functions\ncomputer hypertext regards as a constitutive yet still strives to define,\nnamely, integration of the reader into the writing process and real-time\naccess to the archive ... Thus Innis ‘expects the reader to make discovery\nafter discovery that he himself had missed.’”[21](fm02.html#fm02en21a)\n\nThe act of reading the mosaic then is envisaged as an experience which\nenhances the process of construction of knowledge, as well as a process of\n_actualization_ of a knowledge elaborated through time and space by language.\nIt is that very process of actualization which awakens readers from the\nNarcissus-narcosis. The mosaic, as the form which embeds and allows such an\nexperience, is a _cold_ medium or a truly _tactile_\none[22](fm02.html#fm02en22a) because it forces the reader to compensate for\nwhat is not obvious in the text but which is nevertheless present and\ncompressed in a probe or in a pun. The _portability of thought_ so translated\nis what makes the mosaic a hyper _language_ more than a hyper _text_. After\nall, language is an oral/acoustic concept and text is a linear one, with all\nthat implies in terms of sensorial awareness and active participation.\n\nIn _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , McLuhan recapitulates the glosses at the very end\nof the book in a sequence which can be perceived as an _imagistic_ table of\ncontents for the whole book. As Ezra Pound taught us, an image “is that which\npresents an intellectual and an emotional complex in an instant of\ntime.”[23](fm02.html#fm02en23a) It creates synaesthesia, simultaneity,\nmultiple perspectives, intellectual and emotional links. Readers could, in\nfact, work just on the probes listed at the end as if they were “imagistic\nimages,” juxtaposing them in order to trigger new speculations,\nunderstandings, and knowledge. By so doing, readers are promoted to the role\nof co-creators. The aphoristic probes contained in the end index evoke all\nthat which is discussed in the book. The insightful reader can act as a\nstoryteller and extend McLuhan’s production of meaning and knowledge. In this\nsense, the probes can be perceived not only as idea boxes, but also as imagist\none-liners and contextual puns, in the sense that Pound meant his cantos to be\nread. What is first hidden in the clever musicality opens itself, upon\nreflection, to a concrete representation of an idea. Upon reflection, we find\nout that the probes are not being juxtaposed according to a linear\nsubordination, but instead aimed at triggering associations.\n\n### Post-literate _Paideia_\n\nIt is through language that McLuhan taught us how to understand the way new\nmedia reconfigure our world in the _form_ of a global village. Through\nlanguage, he probed how cultural, societal, and communicative dynamics shift\ninside a highly technological environment. Through language, he tried to\nawaken us and alert us to the difficulties of grasping the long-term effects\nof all technological innovations on our senses and on our realities. How was\nMcLuhan able to “see” and to “understand” ahead of others (since the 1950s)\nsituations which are all too obvious to us today? What turned him into a\nsagacious _visionary_ or _media prophet_? My answers are precise. It was his\nhumanistic background, his passion for literature, and his capability of\ndeveloping a way of simultaneously _looking at_ and _through_ things based on\nhis lifelong training in the humanities.\n\nBy definition, a “humanist” is: (1) a believer in the principles of humanism;\n(2) one who is concerned with the interest and welfare of humans; (3) a\nclassical scholar; (4) a student of the liberal arts; (5) a Renaissance\nscholar devoted to Humanism. McLuhan was all these definitions at once: he\nwrote his PhD dissertation on English Renaissance, offering a deep analysis of\nthe liberal arts of the trivium (grammar, rhetoric,\ndialectic);[24](fm02.html#fm02en24a) as an intellectual, he believed in the\nliberal and lay principles of Humanism and was deeply concerned with the\ninterests and welfare of humans in his own time. Being a humanist, McLuhan’s\nideas of _welfare_ and _interest_ , though, did not concern merely the\nmaterial side of the human existence, but also the intellectual and the\nemotional; his own interest in media derived from the need to fully understand\nthe impact that the evolving technological, cultural, and sociological\nprocesses were having on us humans. Freedom, independence, and free will\nresult from knowledge and understanding of what is really going on around us,\nas he clearly assumes in the introduction to his first published book, _The\nMechanical Bride. The Gutenberg Galaxy_ provides a method to translate that\nlesson into an operative strategy of investigation.\n\nWith _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ McLuhan shared his own _reading process_ of the\nworld, which is, in fact, a carefully conceived epistemological mode of\ninvestigation. As a humanist, he opted for Francis Bacon’s _broken knowledge_\nand _aphorisms_ – which he actualized through his thorough investigation of\nthe great modernist masters – so to encourage his readers to enquire further\nby themselves.[25](fm02.html#fm02en25a) The process of reading and\nunderstanding (a book, the world) is what is at stake in _The Gutenberg\nGalaxy_. While _reading_ his writing, you also _experience_ the world or the\nsituation he is processing analogically: his mosaic is a form which defines\nMcLuhan as a “post-secondary orality” humanist or media theorist, a definition\nwhich is to be explored in the light of his scholarly background, as well as\nof his lifelong curiosity for all human productions.\n\nHe turned upside down what had been effectively established by centuries of\nserious schooling, suggesting new modes of explorations based on the shocking\nassociation of apparently disparate ideas and topics. He experimented with\ninterdisciplinarity before interdisciplinary studies were the fashion. And,\neven worse, he appeared to enjoy it! Most critics accused him of being too\nenthusiastic about all that was new; quite ironically, he was in fact acting\non the basis of very ancient and traditional paradigms. In the never-ending\nbattle of books, McLuhan stood for the ancients, not for the moderns, because\nhis idea of knowledge was rooted in the arts of the trivium and was strongly\nshaped by a grammarian’s approach. His media theories derive, in effect, from\nthat knowledge of the trivium and are developed through its application. “By\nsurpassing writing we have regained our WHOLENESS, not on a national or\ncultural but cosmic plane,”[26](fm02.html#fm02en26a) he wrote. Being a\ngrammarian, McLuhan explored such wholeness in his vocation, looking for\n_connections through differences_ , acting on a cosmic plane himself.\n\nMcLuhan elaborated a new way of looking at our habitat. He combined scholarly\nbackground, knowledge of contemporary literature and art, as well as pop\nculture to explore what was going on around him and to alert his readers to\nthe ongoing cultural processes. With _The Gutenberg Galaxy_, he showed us that\nonly an _integrated approach_ brings together different domains which\ncontribute to our understanding of the _wholeness_ of the then electric, and\nnow Internet and digital, age. Consistently, he insisted that in the\ninformation age, the specialist is an anachronism, someone that, according to\nhim, “never makes small mistakes while moving toward the grand\nfallacy.”[27](fm02.html#fm02en27a) He reconsidered the idea of education and\nrefused the compartmentalized academic methods of investigation, since they no\nlonger mirrored the new reality. To observe the electric simultaneity through\nthe rear-view mirror of linearity would imply to rely upon a distorted version\nof reality. For McLuhan, the time had come to change spectacles and adopt new\nlenses. What is fascinating to discover is that McLuhan’s _new spectacles_\nwere in fact the _ancient trivium_.\n\nIn his books, McLuhan applies the modernist lesson and uses avant-garde\nexperimental works to explore and draw parallels between the new media-induced\nlandscape and ancient forms of societies and educational patterns. _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ , for example, retrieves some of the tenets explored in his\ndoctoral dissertation, as well as Bacon’s lesson, and establishes the mosaic\nas a form at once retrieving and triggering knowledge. At the same time, in\nhis public lectures, he continuously discussed the role of education in a mass\nsociety. In particular, he encouraged a “totally new\napproach”[28](fm02.html#fm02en28a) leading to a “global education program that\nwill enable us to seize the reins of our destiny.”[29](fm02.html#fm02en29a)\nSuch a program would serve not to homogenize people’s thought (“to win\nconsent,” in Bacon’s words), but, on the contrary, to induce a critical\nattitude to media in general. McLuhan considered higher education as the\nnecessary tool to counterbalance cultural homologation; by higher education he\nmeant a _classic_ education. The ancient _paideia_ , a Greek term meaning “to\neducate,” is associated with the idea of a rounded cultural education pursued\nin the light of a public life engaged in public good and interest. Paideia is\ntherefore the tool that McLuhan postulated as the only one capable to\ncounterbalance the subliminal effects of new media on the human sensorium. For\nMcLuhan, literature and the arts were the instruments through which the\nancient paideia could be retrieved. His laws of media are based on such\npedagogical principles and form a post-literate tool that enhances paideia;\nthey are a carefully conceived system of observation based on the combined\naction of the trivium, with a special emphasis on the “evocative power” of\nwords.[30](fm02.html#fm02en30a)\n\nMcLuhan’s mosaic is fully inscribed inside such an educational philosophy; it\nchallenges the idea that knowledge proceeds through a progressive line and\nrefutes the idea that new knowledge results from the mere accumulation of data\nand concepts. As a discontinuous form, the mosaic forces readers to shift from\na visual (linear) to an acoustic (all-at-once) perspective; by so doing, the\nmosaic teaches us to acquire a simultaneous vision of various phenomena,\nacting simultaneously, in the here and now, and constantly affecting the\nphenomena.\n\nSetting McLuhan’s mosaic and his educational philosophy in his own time, we\ncan recognize that he set off on a very difficult mission. His most celebrated\nbooks (_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ [1962]; _Understanding Media_ [1964]) came out\njust a few years before the countercultures of the sixties exploded worldwide.\nKnowledge was instrumental to the preservation of traditional institutions;\nthe classroom was a place where you went to listen to your teachers and to\nlearn notions by the book and not to question them. In the sixties, when\nMcLuhan established his famous Monday night seminars at the Coach House, at\nthe University of Toronto, his classroom looked like an agora, a piazza,\nrather than a traditional classroom. His lessons were conceived as _probes_\nchallenging students and listeners to think about his media observations; as a\nprofessor, he wanted to _turn them on_. Those who attended his seminars still\nremember them as both engaging and entertaining; also, they recall how, a few\nyears later when McLuhan had become renowned worldwide, they attracted VIPs\nand many celebrities to the Coach House. At the Coach House, McLuhan and his\nwell-known guests provocatively urged the students to join them in their\nexplorations. He invited them to approach literature and the arts as tools\nfacilitating the sensorial and cognitive shift from the ivory tower to the\ncontrol tower. What McLuhan suggested in those seminars is that _creativity is\nthe perfect antidote to all fear of change_. He often reminded them of Edgar\nAllan Poe’s sailor, of his adventure in the maelstrom, and of the way he used\nrational detachment and amusement to overcome terror.[31](fm02.html#fm02en31a)\n\nAs early as 1959, in a lecture offered to the American Association for Higher\nEducation, McLuhan anticipated that “the future of the book is\ninclusive.”[32](fm02.html#fm02en32a) On that occasion, he set the book against\nthe new electric ground formed by radio and television and suggested that in\nthe new age, children and students would learn more and more through\napprenticeship and less and less through study. He was right. Today we know\nthat the new cultural and technological context preserves literacy and the\nbook but encourages them both to respond to their new electric ground; they\nare two literate figures which must adjust to a clear sensorial and\nenvironmental change.\n\nThe old medium stays around but it is reshaped according to the new\npotentialities embedded by the new media. Learning from previous avant-garde\nmovements such as symbolism, futurism, or vorticism, McLuhan understood that\n_the written page had to become the interface through which the new electric\nsimultaneity would reveal itself_ at a time when hypertexts were but a\nspeculative possibility among a limited group of researchers. The paradox\nunderpinning the elaboration of the mosaic style of writing is how to open the\nold medium – writing – to new media in order to preserve the thought processes\nof the old medium itself. But it is, in turn, part of another paradox which is\nimplicit in the very form of the electric media. The new _acoustic_ perception\nmust, in fact, be expressed through a form which is inevitably (and here is\nthe paradox) _visually_ rendered and shaped. The new electric age comes after\nthe literate age, and could even be interpreted as its ultimate product; by\nnecessity, according to McLuhan, it must take the literate age as its content.\nIndividuals cannot cancel centuries of literacy – even if they think they can\n– because the orality induced by the new electric media is, in fact, itself a\n_literate_ secondary orality. Instead of asking the old question, can Dick and\nJane read? we now ask: are they media _literate_?\n\nAs Ong reminded us, secondary orality is a sort of “impure” and “hybrid”\norality since in it both writing and printing stay as fundamental components\nof the new technological language.[33](fm02.html#fm02en33a) It is, in fact, a\n_parole_ , a word or spoken language determined by acoustic and tactile means.\nSecondary orality is so called because by its very nature or “physiology” it\nis both spoken-as-written and/or written-as-spoken and is the related\ninterplay of speech and text, that is, the perceptive dynamics which take\nplace between media and its users on the computer screen; or when text\nmessaging; or when activating applications through image and touch on iPhones.\nThe acoustic aspect, as implied by McLuhan, means the remodelling of the\nenvironment by turning it from a visual bias to an oral bias while, at the\nsame time, using older media as fundamental components of the ongoing\ncommunicative process: old media integrate into new media and are re-\nelaborated into new formal combinations and hybrids. “**NEW MEDIA DO NOT\nREPLACE EACH OTHER, THEY COMPLICATE EACH OTHER.** ” A new medium often\nenhances the subtler proprieties of old ones which one has so far neglected\nbecause of a standardized use. McLuhan called this paradox “the rear-view\nmirror effect.”\n\nNow imagine the kind of change digital access will bring to analogue content,\ncausing a convergence that will mediate the total mediascape into the content\nof thought. That no longer is the world of secondary orality, as per Ong. New\ndigital media retrieve both the alphabet and the printed word and include them\nin the newly convergent **_post-secondary orality_** : this is our new\nevolving ground. Through digital media, we are shifting from secondary orality\nto post-secondary orality. What is now done in digital hypertexts McLuhan had\nalready started doing on the printed page. His discontinuous mosaic form of\nwriting was what showed me, in 1996 when I first read _Gutenberg Galaxy_ , the\nnew potentialities inherent to the old linear medium of print. Released and\nfreed from a too-rigid structure imposed by the mechanics of print culture,\nwords can retrieve ancient heuristic properties linked to ancient societal\nconstructs and systems of knowledge. Today, we are but on the brink of these\nnew heuristic potentialities emphasized and retrieved by new forms of media\nwhich seem to enhance participation in process more than privacy and\ndetachment (albeit in vicarious ways).\n\nMcLuhan was not around when the World Wide Web exploded onto the world, but he\nread Norbert Weiner and understood that the book as an object would be\npreserved in the electrified command and control of the computer age; in fact,\nhe cross-read and applied various semantics. He grasped what the new form\nwould do to cybernetics and communication studies and reconfigured its effect\nand how it will launch the new electric tribal circle. Adopting and adapting\nstrategies already examined by modernist explorers, he turned his printed\npages into interfaces detecting and revealing the new electric simultaneity.\nThe mosaic style of writing encourages deep participation; both words and\ngaps, both knowledge and ignorance, play a role in the process. Not only are\nwe asked to investigate bold associations, but we must also let the interval\nthrough which they juxtapose resound and resonate through what we know and\ndon’t know. Its broken knowledge combines knowingness and unknowingness with\nmodernist heuristics; montage and collage are not just techniques used to\ndisrupt linearity, they become rhetorical strategies employed to retrieve _the\ncomplexity of generating new knowledge_. If we do not play according to the\nrhetorician’s intention, we risk turning the complex architecture into a\ntrivial version of the reader’s digest. A similar risk is always present when\nexploring the World Wide Web: we jump from a _fragment_ to the next one, but\nif we do not make the interval _resonate_ , we flatten our understanding and\nturn _knowledge_ into _information_; we also tend to oversimplify complex\nissues, and neglect history or the nature of our stratified memories (we move\nfrom the School of Athens to the School of Paris, so to speak). In the late\nfifties, McLuhan suggested that in order to counterbalance the side effects of\nnew cultural forces and educational agencies – already acting outside the\nclassroom and turning students into “consumers,” “co-authors,” and “co-\nproducers” of both information and knowledge – teachers and scholars should no\nlonger be “the source of data but of _insight_.” Consistently, his probes do\nnot translate data, but _the dynamics underpinning the probing process_ of\nwhich the mosaic is the interactive playground: while engaging with the\nmosaic, we learn _by apprenticeship_ , _by doing_.\n\nThe anthropologist Edmund (Ted) Carpenter, Marshall McLuhan’s lifelong friend\nand colleague, wrote that “knowledge of media alone is not sufficient\nprotection from them.” A fact, he explained, that also applied to the man who\ntaught us how to understand media: “The moment Marshall McLuhan shifted from\nprivate media analyst to public media participant, he was converted into an\nimage media manipulated & exploited.”[34](fm02.html#fm02en34a) One hundred\nyears after his birth, we have now the occasion to return McLuhan from figure\n(his media image) to ground (the complex bringing together of his media\ninvestigations as well as his scholarly formation) by probing his mosaic and,\nthrough that, assessing the literary roots of all his discourses on media.\nWell, it’s THAT what makes McLuhan’s “little point” so original and _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ not just a book on media but a book on our own way to\nperceive change and environments as “human beings.” Enjoy your reading of _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ , playfully accept McLuhan’s challenge; learn by doing.

For first, it trieth\nthe writer, whether he be superficial or solid: for aphorisms, except they\nshould be ridiculous, cannot be made but of the pith and heart of sciences;\nfor discourse of illustration is cut off; recitals of examples are cut off;\ndiscourse of connection and order is cut off; descriptions of practice are cut\noff. So there remaineth nothing to fill the aphorism but some good quantity of\nobservation; and therefore no man can suffice, nor in reason will attempt, to\nwrite aphorisms, but he that is sound and grounded ... Secondly, methods are\nmore fit to win consent or belief, but less fit to point to action ...

After the sinking of his small\nfishing boat and getting thrown into the maelstrom, a sailor manages to\nsurvive because he _stops to observe_ the way the liquid vortex works.

Marsh Jeanneret, reflecting on\nscholarly publishing at the University of Toronto Press as its director,\nclearly states that _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ (1962) was a publishing landmark.\n“UofT Press sold about 55,000 copies in hardback and in the Canadian\nUniversity Paperbooks edition, plus 135,000 copies in a mass-market paperback\nformat, for which they leased rights to the New American Library” (Jeanneret\n1989, 155). In the spring of 1963 Marshall McLuhan was presented with the\nGovernor General’s Award for this critical and expository prose. McLuhan\ncontinued to transcend scholarly publishing in much of what he wrote, in most\nof what he said, and always in the way he responded to popular acceptation.\nHis books introduced into the language our present usage of the terms “age of\ninformation” and “global village,” which have since become commonplaces. But\neven as McLuhan passed across the zenith of his fame, and is now viewed as the\nprophet of the Internet age, without question “he was, in 1962, one of the\nmost influential thinkers of his day” (Jeanneret 1989, 156). By reading _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ as an _essai_ (essay) we are proposing to read the mind-\nopening analogies, inserted between historical displays of ideas, with the\neyes of a flâneur and detached observer, anchored in the culture of McLuhan’s\ntime and much influenced by the Renaissance. And to the twenty-first-century\nreader gazing at the ongoing displacement of the monochromatic type on a page\nby interactive, multidimensional graphics and sound bites in digital scholarly\npublishing, we say that designing a post-Gutenbergian model of knowledge and\nscholarly communication does not entail obliterating the past.\n\nMore than fifty years after the publication of _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , the\nmost inspiring lesson for a writer is thus McLuhan’s strategic and tactile\nunderstanding of print, as a medium of inscription, to delineate the\nboundaries of thought and the interstices between ideas. In a prefatory note\nto _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , McLuhan eschews the linear form of a consecutive\nargument for his book, and presents it as a “mosaic” or field approach to the\ngrasping of the technologies emerging then. Such a mosaic image of critical\nprose and quoted elements offered McLuhan means of revealing causal operations\nin history. To visually display his unorthodox approach, the main body of the\nbook is arranged in the form of 261 more or less self-contained sections, each\nheaded with a punning, epigrammatic, or summarizing statement in large, bold,\nitalic type. Theoretically and as suggested by the author, the sections might\nbe read in any order. The truth is that the mosaic is more than window\ndressing, and in its form _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ follows the classic pattern\nof the essay as a vehicle for the process, rather than the end results, of\nthought. From the Low Latin _essagium_ (cf. the Italian _saggio_ and the\nSpanish _ensayo_), _essai_ or _coup d’essai_ evolved in its usage to mean\n“testing,” “trying out,” or “probing.” McLuhan, like Montaigne, sees in the\nessay structure the testing of the judgment, the mind, the senses, and to an\nextent, the whole being. The essay allows the replacement of logical thought\nby free associations and artistically visually controlled juxtapositions of\nideas. _Galaxy_ contains a wealth of fascinating and novel material about the\nculture of the past 2500 years, and the galaxy McLuhan describes does exist.\n_Galaxy_ is an “undisciplined” contribution to the study of the effect of\nprint on Western culture, and when included in the writingscapes of academe,\nit is the only work of its kind for its form at the time of its publishing. To\nreflect on the form of the book is thus a first step at understanding why _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ is still today such a publishing landmark for the time, and\nwill ever remain a publishing landmark for scholars and universities as\npublishers.\n\nIn the postscript, “The Galaxy Reconfigured or the Plight of Mass Man in an\nIndividualist Society,” McLuhan suggests that we are beginning to understand\nthe Gutenberg era only because “we have moved into another phase from which we\ncan contemplate the contours of the preceding situation with ease and clarity\n... As we experience the new electronic and organic age with ever stronger\nindications of its main outlines, the preceding mechanical age becomes more\nintelligible” (_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , 275).\n\nTechnological determinism is not McLuhan’s invention, for it underpins\nrespectable scholarly works as Lewis Mumford’s _Technics and Civilization_\n(1934), Abbott Payson Usher’s _A History of Mechanical Inventions_ (1929,\n1954). The theme of the revolutionary impact of changes in communications\ninforms, among other works, H.J. Chaytor’s _From Script to Print_ (1945), Eric\nHavelock’s _Preface to Plato_ (1963), Harold A. Innis’s _The Bias of\nCommunication_ (1951), and André Malraux’s _Les voix du silence_ (1951).\nInsightful studies of the historical transformation of human perception, to\nwhich McLuhan is indebted, include Dorothy Lee’s _Freedom and Culture_ (1958),\nE.S. Carpenter’s _Eskimo_ (1959), Edward T. Hall’s _The Silent Language_\n(1959). In these works, relatively novel when _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ was\npublished in 1962, the authors discern the hidden impact of technology and the\ncultural variations in perceptual experience. In _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ ,\nMcLuhan contributes to these twentieth-century views with his attempt to\ninterpret many aspects of experience as shaped by technologies of\ncommunication. He weaves the diverse observations of others (extensively\nquoted and credited) into a series of probes discerning significances where\nothers see information.\n\nThe form of the essay stems from the collections of quotations and aphorisms\nwhich were a very popular genre that helped to spread humanistic material and\nlearning in the sixteenth century and onward. Montaigne’s earliest essays are\nvery short and thick with quotations from classical and other writers. The\nessayist’s goal is to reflect on his or her own art of writing while testing\nhis or her ideas. Montaigne’s successors such as Nashe, Mallarmé, and Pound\nunderstood the inexhaustible potentiality of testing oneself against an\ninfinite variety of subjects with the essay, as a structure, allowing them to\nsay almost everything about any subject. Their use of vivid, bold images,\nepigrammatic wordplay, and a disdain for logical connectives make their texts\n“familiar” and “poetic.” Nashe’s critical prose, scrutinized by McLuhan as he\nwas writing his thesis on this most original Elizabethan writer, convinced\nMcLuhan that the essayist “attempts” an argument, and his text is coextensive\nwith a humanistic commitment to rhetoric as performance. The language Nashe\nexplores in his commercial writing is reflected in McLuhan use of punchy lines\nsuch as “Civilization gives the barbarian or tribal man an eye for an ear and\nis now at odds with the electronic world”(26) and “The Homeric hero becomes a\nsplit-man as he assumes an individual ego” (51) for the headings of _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_.\n\nWhile Mallarmé’s and Pound’s essays are based on the premise of the supremacy\nof poetry, they do not condescend on the visual and auditory forms on a page.\nTheir writings invite a creative reading, an intellectual debate, with the\nwords and letters. Their fragmentary formulations are witty and suggestive\nrather than explicit and didactic, and the initial visual and audio stimuli\nbecome springboards for more wide-ranging meditation on art. No modernist poet\nrelied so heavily upon the genre of the essay as Pound. McLuhan as well, in\n_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , clearly demonstrates his knowledge of the philosophy\nof composition when he makes extensive use of juxtapositions, called by Pound\nthe “ideographic method.” McLuhan, like Montaigne, Mallarmé, and Pound,\nunderstands and uses visual and acoustic language as a metaphor. This\ntechnique allows him to balance visual and acoustic modes of expression from\nother modes of communication. Modelling comprehension of the effects of\ntechnologies on man and culture as a kind of ascetic information processing\nallows McLuhan to reconceive the material subjects of his inquiry, giving it a\nuniversal appeal and approach that could be revivified today when trying to\nmake sense of the effects of digitality on the e-book or on scholarly\ndissemination of knowledge.\n\nThe variety of graphic marks that Marshall McLuhan and Harold Kurschenska\ndesigned for _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , and later McLuhan and Quentin Fiore in\n_The Medium is the Massage_ and _War and Peace in the Global Village_ , are\nplayful encrypted messages that required and still require decipherment. All\nof these books are landmarks in the integration of texts, images, and layout\nin the values of the publishing industry where a divide persisted between\nwords and pictures, and between academia and mass media, in the 1960s. For\nBrian Donnelly (_Touch, Community and Aesthetics: Where Harold Kurschenska’s\nDesigns Take Us_ , 2004), what arose in the late 1950s, and particularly in\nthe work of Harold Kurschenska, was the understanding that design extended\nbeyond the cover and title page; it ran right through into the handcraft, the\nspecification and implementation of the many details of each page, letter by\nletter and line by line. In attending to the material details of production,\nvalues other than radical innovation necessarily prevailed. What distinguishes\n_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ from _The Medium is the Massage_ (published only five\nyears after _Galaxy_) is that the rule of the book, with its many conventions\ngoverning the order of the preliminary pages, the interplay of margins and\nbody text, and the subtle and limited freedom necessary for legibility above\nall else, is still present (Donnelly 2004). Set against the visual\nexplorations of mid-century modernism in the United States (such as Warhol’s),\nKurschenska’s designs are unfortunately perceived today as hardly innovative.\nBut, the strength of Kurschenska’s work lies in three things: “its\nsophisticated understanding and use of the _touch_ and feel of printed\nmaterial; its appeal to _community_ through clarity and efficiency; and an\naesthetic that could perhaps best be described as preferring the _minimal_\nnecessary innovation” (Donnelly 2004, 10).\n\nIn _Galaxy_ McLuhan treats words, sounds, space, lines, punctuation, page\nlayout as the ground demanding sustained decoding of its meanings at various\nlevels. While Fiore gave McLuhan’s ideas their most popular form, McLuhan was\nalready an accessible writer with a multimedia brain, and _The Gutenberg\nGalaxy_ has chapter glosses that already read like advertising headlines.\nUsing the figure/ground technique to unmask the invisible indicates that\nMcLuhan is faithful to the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Somewhat reducing\ncommunication to inscriptions, gestures, and silences allows McLuhan to trick\nthe powers of perception for productive engagement with a no longer discrete\nand hierarchical thought processing. Like a Joycean linguistic machine staging\ndiverse multisensory readings, he highlights with the form of his text the\naesthetic, historical, and humanistic dimensions of perception, whether he\ndepicts “tribal man” or “alphabetic man.”\n\nIn _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ McLuhan links print, radio, and television to\nartistic and scientific explorations, illustrating to the reader that the\nhistory of art coincides with the history of perception. Vision and its\neffects are always inseparable from the possibilities of an observing subject\nwho is both the product and the site of certain practices, techniques, and\nprocedures of subjectification. The author’s playful interaction with the\nprint medium from _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ (1962) to _The Medium is the Massage_\n(1967) and _War and Peace in the Global Village_ (1968) subtly reveals that\nMcLuhan’s tactile inscription on a page is not only correlated to changing\ntechnologies and mechanical practices but to the changing forms of artwork and\nrepresentations. His juxtaposition of visual forms alerts the eyes and the\nmind not to receiving pictures passively but to entering and reassembling them\nactively, raising thus the question: Is typography in _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ a\ndevice to intelligently intertwine figure and ground?\n\nWhile Gutenberg’s fonts simulated the variety of handwriting, humanist\ndesigners at the turn of the sixteenth century distanced the letter from\ncalligraphy by constructing roman alphabets with the tools of geometry. The\nletterform was no longer thought as a sequence of manual strokes, but as a\nconceptual ideal bound to no particular technology. By engaging the reader to\nfocus on perception rather than on interpretation, McLuhan favours sensation\nover intellect, seeing over reading, and physical immediacy over social\nmediation. Baudrillard noted the relationship between McLuhan’s comprehension\nof the artistic role of typography and Walter Benjamin’s landmark essay “The\nWork of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1968). What Walter\nBenjamin explored with his groundbreaking essay (and what McLuhan later\nobserved) is how the age of mass media means audiences can listen to or see a\nwork of art repeatedly and access new meanings each time. Benjamin and McLuhan\nboth grasped that the technique as a medium was the principle and stimulus for\na new generation of meaning. Both authors drew attention to the technique of\nreproduction as a definitive aspect of modern culture, encouraging us to make\nsense or nonsense today of the digital world. Such an approach engages us to\nsee the invisible effects of digital technologies and to connect them with the\nvisible effects of print, radio, and television on culture. It requires from\nus the construction of intelligent imagery to test our understanding of\nobjects for which knowledge is still being built. Using plurimodal languages\nto illustrate the shifts triggered by digital technologies on scholarly\npublishing, or designing perceptual tools that can help the public understand\nwhy research matters, is nonetheless as controversial today in the academic\nworld as it was in the early ’60s.\n\n_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ design was indeed perceived “unorthodox” in the realm\nof the university as publisher in 1962. With its bold copy decks and uneven\nbottom margins, _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ stood outside the conventions of\nacceptable book and scholarly publication design at the time. These\ninnovations though strongly aligned with the cut and thrust of McLuhan\nepigrammatic style (Jeanneret 1989). Carl Dair, a member of the Society of\nTypographic Designers (later the Graphic Designers of Canada) at the time,\nsupported Kurschenska’s work for _Galaxy_ , calling it “an important break in\nthe conventional book pattern.” Dair was convinced that only a few years would\nbe necessary for history to vindicate Kurschenska’s design. As it turned out,\nit took only five years for the modernist development of publishing and design\nto completely overtake Kurschenska’s modest innovations. Designs such as that\ncreated for _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ pose thus important questions for design\nhistory. What does design history achieve when it studies and celebrates\nmaximum innovation?\n\nThe history of modernism began as a renegotiation of visual traditions; new\nvisual experiences were made necessary by the effect of changing technologies.\nTypesetters had to possess a sophisticated knowledge of design to “solve” the\nvarious new layouts. Complex design would be left entirely to layout men such\nas Kurschenska who worked in the typesetting and composition end of the\nprinting press. McLuhan, an ebullient young author when he wrote _The\nMechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man_ , renegotiated meaning for the\nnew visual in the domain of academic publication. _The Mechanical Bride_ was\nread then as an unconventional study of the nature and impact of public\ncommunication via the mass media, including print advertising. For Jeanneret\n(1989), McLuhan came at his thesis from perspectives that were novel,\nimaginative, but often unconvincing. In the spring of 1961, when McLuhan\nsigned the contract for _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , and later in the autumn of\nthat year, when he strode into the University of Toronto Press office to\ndeliver the manuscript, Jeanneret did not fail to recognize it as unique when\nhe sent it over to Francess Halpenny with the following note:\n\nI am not sure how far you have been into this yet, but I am certain you will\nagree with me that it is at once exciting, wild, controversial, unconvincing\nin places, utterly brilliant in others, etc. In short, I do believe that we\nhave here a book that holds the possibilities of being one of the most talked-\nabout and worthwhile works we have published in a long while. But I shudder to\nthink of the copy-editing that it requires, containing the proportion it does\nof typos, quotations and citations, etc. The organization of chapter heads\nalone is a mystery in my mind: I had a further word with the author and he\nseemed to go along with the thought that chapters should run on, broken only\nby his proposed sentence-long heads. It is fairly loaded with coined variants\nof words, and the organization is certainly kaleidoscopic, to put it mildly\n... Nevertheless, I think we should give this book everything we have (as I am\nsure your department will). Just how much “finishing” the author can be\npersuaded to face up to is hard to say; it could stand a vast amount. But I\nthink everyone concerned should be on guard against our selling this item\n“short”; it could turn to be a landmark in our publishing programme, although\nthat may be an over-statement ... (Jeanneret 1989, 154)\n\nTo have labelled it a landmark publication was in no way an overstatement; it\nwas soon to be hailed as that across Canada and throughout the world. _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ , being as daring, edgy, and playful as it is, should\ninspire scholars of the twenty-first century to design a post-Gutenbergian\nmodel of knowledge and scholarly communication that does not entail\nobliterating the past. In the twentieth century, the philosophical essay moved\nfurther away from the ideas of the self, and became more self-conscious, in so\nfar as it is obsessed with language, discourse, and methodology. Whereas\nMcLuhan and Montaigne refused to separate themselves from the method, or to\ndistinguish the living subject from the experienced object in their essays,\nthe modern essay is no longer that of Montaigne’s times. Bound books such as\n_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ have lived a charmed existence since typesetting was\ninvented in mid-fifteenth-century Mainz. This longevity makes me optimistic\nabout its evolutionary persistence in our imagination and way of seeing. As it\nbecomes more a virtual information space than a stable artefact, the\ntraditional volume of papers in between two covers will find another life,\nanother representation, as an interconnective environment integrating audio\nand visual data that conceive and unfold stories of the digital era. Let’s\ntwist thus the kaleidoscope so that Renaissance and eighteenth-century spaces\nof spectacles can gloss our current debates about digital scholarship where\ndata gathering can be aggregated via social media such as curated tweets.\n\nThe will to juxtapose a visual stratigraphy of artefacts can be traced back to\nGiambattista Piranesi; his etching experimentation became one of the greatest\ngraphic innovations of the Renaissance, retrieved on walls, temples, baths,\nand amphitheatres of the remains of a Rome that was no longer visible. The\npower of Piranesi’s visual graphics arose from the collaging of complex\nspatio-temporal events. This design to empower visual knowledge avoids\nclassificatory schemes based on similarity and linear sequence. McLuhan,\nborrowing such a visual approach, asks the observer to make sense of material\nthat was not yet visible or understood (such as radio and television) when\n_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ was published. Mimicking the juxtaposition typical of\nthe baroque, the staging of text, of words and blanks on the page, in _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ and later in _The Medium is the Massage_ is like a mosaic\nwhose tesserae or meanings are simultaneously accessible to sight. Most of the\npages in _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ display visual blocks of texts where only the\nplacement of type indicates the change of authorship (see sample pages from\nthe original edition overleaf on [pages lvi](fm03.html#page_lvi) and\n[lvii](fm03.html#page_lvii)). In _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ McLuhan demonstrates\nhis clear understanding of the laws of media and a trained awareness to make\nsense of complex systems.\n\nIn the Enlightenment, powers of discernment and the development of probing\nhabits of sight were requisite skills. The understanding of elaborate three-\ndimensional mosaic collages demonstrated how we learn and disseminate\nknowledge by gathering, arranging, or juxtaposing bits and pieces. What can we\nlearn today from this collage of vignettes when the coalescence of image,\nspeech, print, performance is being enabled by the latest optical\ninstrumentation of the digital age?\n\nWhether talking of then or now, it is fascinating to note that the reversion\nof linear alphabetical or textual literacy into complex information and\nseductive plurimodal tableaux is appealing to wider and diverse audiences. We\nhave witnessed the collapse of the mass literacy drives initiated during the\nlate eighteenth century. Pixels are our movable types. Manipulable images\ncontinue to supplant directional narratives. The impulse to display and stage\ninformation visually and acoustically though is still everywhere in evidence.\nMosaics of picture, word, and sound constitute playful artificial constructs\nthat are projected from electronic monitors and screens. The eighteenth\ncentury witnessed the deconstruction of isolated genres and the stylish\ncollaging of disparate media, permitting everything to interact with\neverything else. Just as the computer is both the tool and the metaphor for\ntoday’s holistic approach to understanding creative processes, the “conquête\nde l’ubiquité” (conquest of ubiquity) (Valéry 1964), optical apparatus, and\nsensually direct demonstrations are the connective means spurring early modern\ncomplexity research.\n\nBorrowing McLuhan’s line, “The method of the twentieth century is to use not\nsingle but multiple models for experimental exploration – the technique of the\nsuspended judgment” (_The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , 71), we should look at the\ndigital page by deconstructing the collaging of disparate media and make sense\nof that disparity to test our judgment and our whole being as it is pitted\nagainst the challenge of understanding the effect of digitality on our senses\nand mind. There is no doubt that machine-generated images are extremely\nmutable. If they can be misused, they will be. But that is not the fault or\npurpose of the medium. What is at stake is the difficulty of separating forms,\ngenuine information from disinformation, when the material aspects of making\nand the character of the maker are concealed or concealable. The Enlightenment\nhas taught us that within an increasingly phantasmagoric environment, images\nhave to be shown at work. The no longer evident relationship between the\ncomplex form of input and the convergent form of output has to be deliberately\nvisually exposed. In our interactive age when potentially every individual can\ninfluence political, social, cultural, and scientific decisions by simply\nseizing the media, we need to transform raw data and information into meaning\nand look for concrete ways to substantialize mediation. Reconnecting invisible\ncauses with the visible effects of digital technologies thus requires the\nconstruction of intelligent imagery and a knowledge of complex systems.\n\nMuch of the Enlightenment’s understanding of complicated processes depended\nupon dynamic and enlarged representations of tiny systems. The paradox posed\nby complex and contradictory invisibles meant that illuminating metaphors had\nto be drawn from supposedly better demarcated areas of study. Microorganisms\nwere illustrated and regarded as living grotesques. By their incongruity, they\nstartled the observer into paying attention to aspects of reality that could\nbe taken for granted or ignored. As McLuhan did, using analogy in an age of\ndifference and scrutinizing kinetics, shapes, patterns in which a coincidence\nof opposites can be discerned will allow us to enter what was previously an\ninaccessible reality. Since thinking involves scenography, the study of the\nstaging of a flow of perception and the warehousing of memories into the\nspectacle of ideas should be aestheticized.\n\n![Image](../images/f0lvi_01.jpg)\n\n[Pages 72](ch02.html#page_72) and [73](ch02.html#page_73) as set in the\noriginal 1962 edition of _The Gutenberg Galaxy._\n\n![Image](../images/flvii_01.jpg)\n\nIn pondering the mechanism of analogical thought, philosophers (chief among\nthem Plato, Aquinas, and Wittgenstein) admitted the coexistence of\nincommensurable realms. They did not fragment them into cybernetic bits or\nreproduce them ad infinitum with no hope of correlation. Ambiguity and\ndisproportion are inevitable between living things and their representation,\nno matter how close the match. The transfer from a familiar to an unfamiliar\nreferent takes us to equivocal mindscapes. The difficulty is finding enough\nsimilarity to warrant giving a common name to disparate items while\nacknowledging their significant variations. Analogy, and the dynamic\nequilibrium between figure and ground exploited by McLuhan as a method,\nestablishes a proportional relationship either among single items or among a\ngroup of embodied properties existing under diverse conditions and adapted to\nmultiple purposes. Vision makes an imaginative leap; embarking on a\ndialectical process of seeing affinities not easy to convey in words is what\nchallenges authors in the twenty-first century.\n\nScholars see writing as an extension of the body, as a supplement to the\ncapacity to speak; because writing is permanent rather than ephemeral, because\nit withstands movements in place and time, and because it remains readable in\nthe absence of the author, design as touch needs to be reinvented for the\nscholarly publication. The new understanding of the importance and qualities\nof all aspects of visual communication may be the real historical origin of\ndesign. We have come to see computers as driving innovation in design, but it\nmakes more sense to see them as popularizers or promoters, developing the\ndigital means to match the concepts of designers such as Kurschenska who\nstruggle against technology for the autonomy and pleasure of design. With\nfunding for book publishing becoming scarcer, scholars need to reinvent\nmeaningful partnerships with designers and artists, the way McLuhan did, to\nconvey in their essays the findings of their explorations. Pedagogical\nprogrammes such as those designed by museums or architectural studies could as\nwell assist scholars to explore visual languages that translate what cannot be\neffectively described in words. These multimodal spaces allow the scholar to\npicture ambiguity in our age of blinding light. When considering the role\nplayed by universities as publishers for _The GutenbergGalaxy_, we wonder then\nwhat publishers can offer to scholars today. Like in the ’60s, making an\nimpact and making a profit are two different goals. For universities as\npublishers the balance has to be maintained. Such questions are to be answered\nas well by other organizations such as radio and television. What is the\nfuture of radio on a mobile phone when distribution costs are higher on a\nmobile? We do not have business models yet. Radio or print may just come in a\ndifferent form than what we know radio and television to be like. If podcasts\nare still radio, what is the visual form of radio? Playing with words,\nlayouts, and visual forms is what McLuhan taught us to access in his print\nmaterial, and hence his continuing relevance in our understanding of digital\ntechnologies and social media. We need to develop ways of seeing, to make use\nof game play mechanics the way McLuhan did, and interact, body and mind, with\nour own digital inscriptions and gestures.\n\n### References\n\nBenjamin, W. 1968. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” In\n_Illuminations: Essays and Reflections_.

Thus the galaxy or constellation of events\nupon which the present study concentrates is itself a mosaic of perpetually\ninteracting forms that have undergone kaleidoscopic transformation –\nparticularly in our own time.\n\nThere might have been some advantage in substituting for the word “galaxy” the\nword “environment.” Any technology tends to create a new human environment.\nScript and papyrus created the social environment we think of in connection\nwith the empires of the ancient world. The stirrup and the wheel created\nunique environments of enormous scope. Technological environments are not\nmerely passive containers of people but are active processes that reshape\npeople and other technologies alike. In our time the sudden shift from the\nmechanical technology of the wheel to the technology of electric circuitry\nrepresents one of the major shifts of all historical time. Printing from\nmovable types created a quite unexpected new environment – it created the\nPUBLIC. Manuscript technology did not have the intensity or power of extension\nnecessary to create publics on a national scale. What we have called “nations”\nin recent centuries did not, and could not, precede the advent of Gutenberg\ntechnology any more than they can survive the advent of electric circuitry\nwith its power of totally involving all people in all other people.\n\nThe unique character of the “public” created by the printed word was an\nintense and visually oriented self-consciousness, both of the individual and\nthe group. The consequences of this intense visual stress with its increasing\nisolation of the visual faculty from the other senses are presented in this\nbook. Its theme is the extension of the visual modalities of continuity,\nuniformity, and connectiveness to the organization of time and space alike.\nElectric circuitry does not support the extension of visual modalities in any\ndegree approaching the visual power of the printed word.\n\nThe last section of the book, “The Galaxy Reconfigured,” deals with the clash\nof electric and mechanical, or print, technologies, and the reader may find it\nthe best prologue.\n\n\n## Prologue\n\nThe present volume is in many respects complementary to _The Singer of Tales_\nby Albert B. Lord. Professor Lord has continued the work of Milman Parry,\nwhose Homeric studies had led him to consider how oral and written poetry\nnaturally followed diverse patterns and functions. Convinced that the poems of\nHomer were oral compositions, Parry “set himself the task of proving\nincontrovertibly if it were possible, the oral character of the poems, and to\nthat end he turned to the study of the Yugoslav epics.” His study of these\nmodern epics was, he explained, “to fix with exactness the _form_ of oral\nstory poetry. ... Its method was to observe singers working in a thriving\ntradition of unlettered song and see how the form of their songs hangs upon\ntheir having to learn and practice their art without reading and\nwriting.”[1](ch01_fn01.html#ch01_fn01fn1)\n\nProfessor Lord’s book, like the studies of Milman Parry, is quite natural and\nappropriate to our electric age, as _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ may help to\nexplain. We are today as far into the electric age as the Elizabethans had\nadvanced into the typographical and mechanical age. And we are experiencing\nthe same confusions and indecisions which they had felt when living\nsimultaneously in two contrasted forms of society and experience. Whereas the\nElizabethans were poised between medieval corporate experience and modern\nindividualism, we reverse their pattern by confronting an electric technology\nwhich would seem to render individualism obsolete and the corporate\ninterdependence mandatory.\n\nPatrick Cruttwell had devoted an entire study (_The ShakespeareanMoment_) to\nthe artistic strategies born of the Elizabethan experience of living in a\ndivided world that was dissolving and resolving at the same time. We, too,\nlive at such a moment of interplay of contrasted cultures, and _The Gutenberg\nGalaxy_ is intended to trace the ways in which the _forms_ of experience and\nof mental outlook and expression have been modified, first by the phonetic\nalphabet and then by printing. The enterprise which Milman Parry undertook\nwith reference to the contrasted _forms_ of oral and written poetry is here\nextended to the _forms_ of thought and the organization of experience in\nsociety and politics. That such a study of the divergent nature of oral and\nwritten social organization has not been carried out by historians long ago is\nrather hard to explain. Perhaps the reason for the omission is simply that the\njob could only be done when the two conflicting forms of written and oral\nexperience were once again co-existent as they are today. Professor Harry\nLevin indicates as much in his preface to Professor Lord’s _The Singer of\nTales_ (p. xiii):\n\nThe term “literature,” presupposing the use of letters, assumes that verbal\nworks of imagination are transmitted by means of writing and reading. The\nexpression “oral literature” is obviously a contradiction in terms. Yet we\nlive at a time when literacy itself has become so diluted that it can scarcely\nbe invoked as an esthetic criterion. The Word as spoken or sung, together with\na visual image of the speaker or singer, has meanwhile been regaining its hold\nthrough electrical engineering. A culture based upon the printed book, which\nhas prevailed from the Renaissance until lately, has bequeathed to us – along\nwith its immeasurable riches – snobberies which ought to be cast aside. We\nought to take a fresh look at tradition, considered not as the inert\nacceptance of a fossilized corpus of themes and conventions, but as an organic\nhabit of re-creating what has been received and is handed on.\n\nThe omission of historians to study the revolution in the _forms_ of thought\nand social organization resulting from the phonetic alphabet has a parallel in\nsocio-economic history. As early as 1864–67 Karl Rodbertus elaborated his\ntheory of “Economic Life in Classical Antiquity.” In _Trade and Market in the\nEarly Empires_ ([p. 5](ch01.html#page_5)), Harry Pearson describes his\ninnovation as follows:\n\nThis remarkably modern view of the social function of money has not been\nsufficiently appreciated. Rodbertus realized that the transition from a\n“natural economy” to a “money economy” was not simply a technical matter,\nwhich resulted from a substitution of money purchase for barter. He insisted\ninstead that a monetarized economy involved a social structure entirely\ndifferent from that which went with an economy in kind. It was this change in\nthe social structure accompanying the use of money rather than the technical\nfact of its use which ought to be emphasized, he thought. Had this point been\nexpanded to include the varying social structures accompanying trading\nactivity in the ancient world the controversy might have been resolved before\nit began.\n\nIn other words, had Rodbertus further explained that different forms of money\nand exchange structured societies in varying ways, generations of confused\ncontroversy might have been avoided. The matter was finally explained when\nKarl Bucher approached the classical world not from our conventional mode of\nhistorical retrospect but from the primitive side. By starting with non-\nliterate societies and moving toward the classical world, “he suggested that\nancient economic life might better be understood if viewed from the\nperspective of primitive rather than modern\nsociety.”[2](ch01_fn02.html#ch01_fn02fn2)\n\nSuch a reverse perspective of the literate Western world is the one afforded\nto the reader of Albert Lord’s _Singer of Tales._ But we also live in an\nelectric or post-literate time when the jazz musician uses all the techniques\nof oral poetry. Empathic identification with all the oral modes is not\ndifficult in our century.\n\nIn the electronic age which succeeds the typographic and mechanical era of the\npast five hundred years, we encounter new shapes and structures of human\ninterdependence and of expression which are “oral” in form even when the\ncomponents of the situation may be non-verbal. This question is raised more\nfully in the concluding section of _The Gutenberg Galaxy._ It is not a\ndifficult matter in itself, but it does call for some reorganization of\nimaginative life. Such a change of modes of awareness is always delayed by the\npersistence of older patterns of perception. The Elizabethans appear to our\ngaze as very medieval. Medieval man thought of himself as classical, just as\nwe consider ourselves to be modern men. To our successors, however, we shall\nappear as utterly Renaissance in character, and quite unconscious of the major\nnew factors which we have set in motion during the past one hundred and fifty\nyears.\n\nFar from being deterministic, however, the present study will, it is hoped,\nelucidate a principal factor in social change which may lead to a genuine\nincrease of human autonomy. Peter Drucker writing on “The Technological\nRevolution” of our time in _Technology and Culture_ (vol. II, no. 4, 1961, p.\n348) states: “There is only one thing we do not know about the Technological\nRevolution – but it is essential: What happened to bring about the basic\nchange in attitudes, beliefs, and values which released it? ‘Scientific\nprogress’, I have tried to show, had little to do with it. But how responsible\nwas the great change in world outlook which, a century earlier, had brought\nabout the great Scientific Revolution?” _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ at least\nattempts to supply the “one thing we do not know.” But even so, there may well\nprove to be some other things!\n\nThe method employed throughout this study is directly related to what Claude\nBernard presented in his classic introduction to _The Study of Experimental\nMedicine_. Observation, Bernard explains ([pp. 8](ch01.html#page_8)–9),\nconsists in noting phenomena without disturbing them, but: “Experiment,\naccording to the same physiologists, implies, on the contrary, the idea of a\nvariation or disturbance that an investigator brings into the conditions of\nnatural phenomena.... To do this, we suppress an organ in the living subject,\nby a section or ablation; and from the disturbance produced in the whole\norganism or in a special function, we deduce the function of the missing\norgan.”\n\nThe work of Milman Parry and Professor Albert Lord was directed to observing\nthe entire poetic process under oral conditions, and in contrasting that\nresult with the poetic process which we under written conditions, assume as\n“normal.” Parry and Lord, that is, studied the poetic organism when the\nauditory function was suppressed by literacy. They might also have considered\nthe effect on the organism when the visual function of language was given\nextraordinary extension and power by literacy. And this is a factor in the\nexperimental method which may have been overlooked just because it was\ninconvenient to manage. But given intense and exaggerated action, “the\ndisturbance produced in the whole organism or in a special function” is\nequally observable.\n\nMan the tool-making animal, whether in speech or in writing or in radio, has\nlong been engaged in extending one or another of his sense organs in such a\nmanner as to disturb all of his other senses and faculties. But having made\nthese experiments, men have consistently omitted to follow them with\nobservations.\n\nJ. Z. Young, writing on _Doubt and Certainty in Science_ , notes ([pp.\n67](ch02.html#page_67)–8):\n\nThe effect of stimulations, external or internal, is to break up the unison of\naction of some part or the whole of the brain. A speculative suggestion is\nthat the disturbance in some way breaks the unity of the actual pattern that\nhas been previously built up in the brain. The brain then selects those\nfeatures from the input that tend to repair the model and to return the cells\nto their regular synchronous beating. I cannot pretend to be able to develop\nthis idea of models in our brain in detail, but it has great possibilities in\nshowing how we tend to fit ourselves to the world and the world to ourselves.\nIn some way the brain initiates sequences of actions that tend to return it to\nits rhythmic pattern, this return being the act of consummation, or\ncompletion. If the first action performed fails to do this, fails that is to\nstop the original disturbance, then other sequences may be tried. The brain\nruns through its rules one after another, matching the input with its various\nmodels until somehow unison is achieved. This may perhaps only be after\nstrenuous, varied, and prolonged searching. During this random activity\nfurther connexions and action patterns are formed and they in turn will\ndetermine future sequences.\n\nThe inevitable drive for “closure,” “completion,” or equilibrium occurs both\nwith the suppression and the extension of human sense or function. Since _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_ is a series of historical observations of the new cultural\ncompletions ensuing upon the “disturbances,” first of literacy, and then of\nprinting, the statement of an anthropologist may assist the reader at this\npoint:\n\nToday man has developed extensions for practically everything he used to do\nwith his body. The evolution of weapons begins with the teeth and the fist and\nends with the atom bomb. Clothes and houses are extensions of man’s biological\ntemperature-control mechanisms. Furniture takes the place of squatting and\nsitting on the ground. Power tools, glasses, TV, telephones, and books which\ncarry the voice across both time and space are examples of material\nextensions. Money is a way of extending and storing labor. Our transportation\nnetworks now do what we used to do with our feet and backs. In fact, all man-\nmade material things can be treated as extensions of what man once did with\nhis body or some specialized part of his body.[3](ch01_fn03.html#ch01_fn03fn3)\n\nThat outering or uttering of sense which is language and speech is a tool\nwhich “made it possible for man to accumulate experience and knowledge in a\nform that made easy transmission and maximum use\npossible.”[4](ch01_fn04.html#ch01_fn04fn4)\n\nLanguage is metaphor in the sense that it not only stores but translates\nexperience from one mode into another. Money is metaphor in the sense that it\nstores skill and labour and also translates one skill into another. But the\nprinciple of exchange and translation, or metaphor, is in our rational power\nto translate all of our senses into one another. This we do every instant of\nour lives. But the price we pay for special technological tools, whether the\nwheel or the alphabet or radio, is that these massive _extensions_ of sense\nconstitute _closed_ systems. Our private senses are not closed systems but are\nendlessly translated into each other in that experience which we call con-\nsciousness. Our extended senses, tools, technologies, through the ages, have\nbeen closed systems incapable of interplay or collective awareness. Now, in\nthe electric age, the very instantaneous nature of co-existence among our\ntechnological instruments has created a crisis quite new in human history. Our\nextended faculties and senses now constitute a single field of experience\nwhich demands that they become collectively conscious. Our technologies, like\nour private senses, now demand an interplay and ratio that makes _rational_\nco-existence possible. As long as our technologies were as slow as the wheel\nor the alphabet or money, the fact that they were separate, closed systems was\nsocially and psychically supportable. This is not true now when sight and\nsound and movement are simultaneous and global in extent. A ratio of interplay\namong these extensions of our human functions is now as necessary collectively\nas it has always been for our private and personal rationality in terms of our\nprivate senses or “wits,” as they were once called.\n\nHitherto historians of culture have tended to isolate technological events\nmuch in the way that classical physics dealt with physical events. Louis de\nBroglie, describing _The Revolution in Physics_ , makes much of this\nlimitation of the Cartesian and Newtonian procedures which are so near those\nof the historians using an individual “point of view” ([p.\n14](ch02.html#page_14)):\n\nFaithful to the Cartesian ideal, classical physics showed us the universe as\nbeing analogous to an immense mechanism which was capable of being described\nwith complete precision by the localization of its parts in space and by their\nchange in the course of time. … But such a conception rested on several\nimplicit hypotheses which were admitted almost without our being aware of\nthem. One of these hypotheses was that the framework of space and time in\nwhich we seek almost instinctively to localize all of our sensations is a\nperfectly rigid and fixed framework where each physical event can, in\nprinciple, be rigorously localized independently of all the dynamic processes\nwhich are going on around it.\n\nWe shall see how not only Cartesian but Euclidean perceptions are constituted\nby the phonetic alphabet. And the revolution that de Broglie describes is a\nderivative not of the alphabet but of the telegraph and of radio. J. Z. Young,\na biologist, makes the same point as de Broglie. Having explained that\nelectricity is not a thing that “flows” but is “the condition we observe when\nthere are certain spatial relations between things,” he explains ([p.\n111](ch02.html#page_111)):\n\nSomething similar has happened as physicists have devised ways of measuring\nvery small distances. It has been found no longer possible to use the old\nmodel of supposing that what was being done was to divide up something called\nmatter into a series of bits, each with definite properties called size,\nweight, or position. Physicists do not now say that matter “is made” of bodies\ncalled atoms, protons, electrons, and so on. What they have done is to give up\nthe materialist method of describing their observations in terms of something\nmade as by a human process of manufacture, like a cake. The word atom or\nelectron is not used as the name of a piece. It is used as part of the\ndescription of the observations of physicists. It has no meaning except as\nused by people who know the experiments by which it is revealed.\n\nAnd, he adds, “it is important to realize that great changes in ways of\n_ordinary_ human speaking and acting are bound up with the adoption of new\ninstruments.”\n\nHad we meditated on such a basic fact as that long ago, we might easily have\nmastered the nature and effects of all our technologies, instead of being\npushed around by them. At any rate, _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ is a prolonged\nmeditation on that theme of J. Z. Young.\n\nNobody has been more conscious of the futility of our closed systems of\nhistorical writing than Abbot Payson Usher. His classic, _A History of\nMechanical Inventions_ , is an explanation of why such closed systems cannot\nmake contact with the facts of historical change: “The cultures of antiquity\ndo not fit the patterns of the linear sequences of social and economic\nevolution developed by the German Historical Schools. … If linear concepts of\ndevelopment are abandoned and the development of civilization is viewed\nfrankly as a multilinear process much can be done toward the understanding of\nthe history of Western culture as a progressive integration of many separate\nelements.” ([pp. 30](ch02.html#page_30)–1)\n\nA historical “point of view” is a kind of closed system that is closely\nrelated to typography, and flourishes where the unconscious effects of\nliteracy flourish without countervailing cultural forces. Alexis de\nTocqueville, whose literacy was much modified by his oral culture, seems to us\nnow to have had a kind of clairvoyance concerning the patterns of change in\nthe France and America of his time. He did not have a point of view, a fixed\nposition from which he filled in a visual perspective of events. Rather he\nsought the operative dynamic in his data:\n\nBut if I go further and seek among these characteristics the principal one,\nwhich includes almost all the rest, I discover that in most of the operations\nof the mind each American appeals only to the individual effort of his own\nunderstanding.\n\nAmerica is therefore one of the countries where the precepts of Descartes are\nleast studied and are best applied. ... Everyone shuts himself tightly up\nwithin himself and insists upon judging the world from\nthere.[5](ch01_fn05.html#ch01_fn05fn5)\n\nHis skill in creating interplay between the written and oral modes of\nperceptual structure enabled de Tocqueville to achieve “scientific” insights\ninto psychology and politics. By this interplay of two modes of perception he\nachieved prophetic understanding while other observers were merely expressing\ntheir private viewpoints. De Tocqueville knew well that typographic literacy\nhad not only produced the Cartesian outlook but also the special traits of\nAmerican psychology and politics. By his method of interplay among divergent\nperceptual modes, de Tocqueville was able to react to his world, not in\nsections but as a whole, and as to an open _field_. And such is the method\nwhich A. P. Usher notes has been absent from the study of cultural history and\nchange. De Tocqueville had employed a procedure such as J. Z. Young describes\n([p. 77](ch02.html#page_77)): “It may be that a great part of the secret of\nthe brain’s powers is the enormous opportunity provided for interaction\nbetween the effects of stimulating each part of the receiving fields. It is\nthis provision of interacting-places or mixing-places that allows us to react\nto the world _as a whole_ to much greater degree than other animals can do.”\nBut our technologies are by no means uniformly favourable to this organic\nfunction of interplay and of interdependence. To investigate this question\nwith respect to alphabetic and typographic culture is the task of the present\nbook. And it is today a quest which cannot but be undertaken in the light of\nnew technologies which deeply affect the traditional operation and achieved\nvalues of alphabetic literacy and typographic culture.\n\nThere is a recent work that seems to me to release me from the onus of mere\neccentricity and novelty in the present study. It is _The Open Society and Its\nEnemies_ by Karl R. Popper, a work devoted to the study of aspects of\ndetribalization in the ancient world and of retribalization in the modern\nworld. For the “open society” was effected by phonetic literacy, as will\nshortly appear, and is now threatened with eradication by electric media, as\nwill be discussed in the conclusion of this study. Needless to say, the “is,”\nrather than the “ought,” of all these developments, is alone being discussed.\nDiagnosis and description must precede valuation and therapy. To substitute\nmoral valuation for diagnosis is a natural and common enough procedure, but\nnot necessarily a fruitful one.\n\nKarl Popper devotes the first part of his large study to the detribalization\nof ancient Greece and the reaction to it. But neither in Greece nor in the\nmodern world does he give any consideration to the dynamics of our\ntechnologically extended senses as factors either in the opening or closing of\nsocieties. His descriptions and analyses follow an economic and political\npoint of view. The passage below is especially relevant to _The Gutenberg\nGalaxy_ because it begins with the interplay of cultures _via_ commerce and\nends with the dissolution of the tribal state, even as it is dramatized by\nShakespeare in _King Lear_.\n\nIt is Popper’s view that tribal or closed societies have a biological unity\nand that “our modern open societies function largely by way of abstract\nrelations, such as exchange or co-operation.” That the abstracting or opening\nof closed societies is the work of the phonetic alphabet, and not of any other\nform of writing or technology, is one theme of _The Gutenberg Galaxy._ On the\nother hand, that closed societies are the product of speech, drum, and ear\ntechnologies, brings us at the opening of the electronic age to the sealing of\nthe entire human family into a single global tribe. And this electronic\nrevolution is only less confusing for men of the open societies than the\nrevolution of phonetic literacy which stripped and streamlined the old tribal\nor closed societies. Popper offers no analysis of the causes of such change,\nbut he does give ([p. 172](ch02a.html#page_172)) a description of the\nsituation that is very relevant to _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ :\n\nBy the sixth century B.C., this development had led to the partial dissolution\nof the old ways of life, and even to a series of political revolutions and\nreactions. And it had led not only to attempts to retain and to arrest\ntribalism by force, as in Sparta, but also to that great spiritual revolution,\nthe invention of critical discussion, and in consequence of thought that was\nfree from magical obsessions. At the same time we find the first symptoms of a\nnew uneasiness. _The strain of civilization was beginning to be felt._\n\nThis strain, this uneasiness, is a consequence of the breakdown of the closed\nsociety. It is still felt even in our day, especially in times of social\nchange. It is the strain created by the effort which life in an open and\npartially abstract society continually demands from us – by the endeavor to be\nrational, to forego at least some of our emotional social needs, to look after\nourselves, and to accept responsibilities. We must, I believe, bear this\nstrain as the price to be paid for every increase in knowledge, in\nreasonableness, in co-operation and in mutual help, and consequently in our\nchances of survival, and in the size of the population. It is the price we\nhave to pay for being human.\n\nThe strain is most closely related to the problem of the tension between the\nclasses which is raised for the first time by the breakdown of the closed\nsociety. The closed society itself does not know this problem. At least to its\nruling members, slavery, caste, and class rule are ‘natural’ in the sense of\nbeing unquestionable. But with the breakdown of the closed society, this\ncertainty disappears, and with it all feeling of security. The tribal\ncommunity (and later the ‘city’) is the place of security for the member of\nthe tribe. Surrounded by enemies and by dangerous or even hostile magical\nforces, he experiences the tribal community as a child experiences his family\nand his home, in which he plays his definite part; a part he knows well, and\nplays well. The breakdown of the closed society, raising as it does the\nproblem of class and other problems of social status, must have had the same\neffect upon the citizens as a serious family quarrel and the breaking up of\nthe family home is liable to have on children. Of course, this kind of strain\nwas felt by the privileged classes, now that they were threatened, more\nstrongly than by those who had formerly been suppressed; but even the latter\nfelt uneasy. They also were frightened by the breakdown of their ‘natural’\nworld. And though they continued to fight their struggle, they were often\nreluctant to exploit their victories over their class enemies who were\nsupported by tradition, the _status quo_ , a higher level of education, and a\nfeeling of natural authority.\n\nThese observations lead us straight on to a consideration of _King Lear_ and\nthe great family quarrel in which the sixteenth century found itself involved\nearly in the Gutenberg Era.\n\n\n## The Gutenberg Galaxy\n\nWhen King Lear proposes “our darker purpose” as the subdivision of his\nkingdom, he is expressing a politically daring and _avant-garde_ intent for\nthe early seventeenth century:\n\nOnly we still retain\n\nThe name, and all th’ additions to a king. The sway,  \nRevenue, execution of the rest,  \nBeloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,  \nThis coronet part betwixt you.[1](ch02a_fn01.html#ch02a_fn01fn1)\n\nLear is proposing an extremely modern idea of delegation of authority from\ncentre to margins. His “darker purpose” would have been recognized at once as\nleft-wing Machiavellianism by an Elizabethan audience. The new patterns of\npower and organization which had been discussed during the preceding century\nwere now, in the early seventeenth century, being felt at all levels of social\nand private life. _King Lear_ is a presentation of the new strategy of culture\nand power as it affects the state, the family, and the individual psyche:\n\nMeantime we shall express our darker purpose.  \nGive me the map there. Know we have divided  \nIn three our kingdom;\n\nThe map was also a novelty in the sixteenth century, age of Mercator’s\nprojection, and was key to the new vision of peripheries of power and wealth.\nColumbus had been a cartographer before he was a navigator; and the discovery\nthat it was possible to continue in a straight-line course, as if space were\nuniform and continuous, was a major shift in human awareness in the\nRenaissance. More important, the map brings forward at once a principal theme\nof King Lear, namely the isolation of the visual sense as a kind of blindness.\n\nIt is in the first scene of the play that Lear expresses his “darker purpose,”\nusing the Machiavellian cant term. Earlier in the first scene the darkness of\nNature, as it were, is shown in the boasting of Gloucester about the\nillegitimacy of his handsome love-child Edmund: “But I have, sir, a son by\norder of law, some year older than this, who is yet no dearer in my account.”\nThe gaiety with which Gloucester alludes to the begetting of Edmund is later\nalluded to by Edgar:\n\nThe dark and vicious place where thee he got  \nCost him his eyes. (V, iii)\n\nEdmund, the love-child, opens the second scene of the play with:\n\nThou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law  \nMy services are bound. Wherefore should I  \nStand in the plague of custom, and permit  \nThe curiosity of nations to deprive me,  \nFor that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines  \nLag of a brother?\n\nEdmund has _l’esprit de quantité_ so essential to tactile measurement and to\nthe impersonality of the empirical mind. Edmund is presented as a force of\nnature, eccentric to mere human experience and “the curiosity of nations.” He\nis a prime agent in the fragmentation of human institutions. But the great\nfragmenter is Lear himself, with his inspired idea of setting up a\nconstitutional monarchy by means of delegating by authority. His plan for\nhimself is that he become a specialist:\n\nOnly we still retain\n\nThe name, and all th’ additions to a King.\n\nFollowing his specialist cue, Goneril and Regan leap into the act of filial\ndevotion with specialist and competitive intensity. It is Lear who fragments\nthem by insisting on a divisive eulogistic competition:\n\nTell me, my daughters\n\n(Since now we will divest us, both of rule,  \nInterest of territory, cares of state),  \nWhich of you shall we say doth love us most?  \nThat we our largest bounty may extend  \nWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril  \nOur eldest-born, speak first.\n\nCompetitive individualism had become the scandal of a society long invested\nwith corporate and collective values. The role played by print in instituting\nnew patterns of culture is not unfamiliar. But one natural consequence of the\nspecializing action of the new forms of knowledge was that all kinds of power\ntook on a strongly centralist character. Whereas the role of the feudal\nmonarch had been inclusive, the king actually including in himself all his\nsubjects, the Renaissance prince tended to become an exclusive power centre\nsurrounded by his individual subjects. And the result of such centralism,\nitself dependent on many new developments in roads and commerce, was the habit\nof delegation of powers and the specializing of many functions in separate\nareas and individuals. In _King Lear_ , as in other plays, Shakespeare shows\nan utter clairvoyance concerning the social and personal consequences of\ndenudation and stripping of attributes and functions for the sake of speed,\nprecision, and increased power. His insights appear so richly in his lines\nthat it is very difficult to select among them. But with the very opening\nwords of Goneril’s aria we are deep in them:\n\nI love you more than words can wield the matter;  \nDearer than eyesight, space, and liberty:\n\nThe stripping of the very human senses themselves will be one of the themes of\nthis play. The separation of sight from the other senses has already been\nstressed in Lear’s expression of his “darker purpose” and his resort to the\nmere visual map. But whereas Goneril is ready to strip off sight as an\nexpression of devotion, Regan rallies to her challenge with:\n\n… I profess\n\nMyself an enemy to all other joys  \nWhich the most precious square of sense professes, …\n\nRegan will strip off all the human senses so long as she possesses Lear’s\nlove.\n\nThe allusion to “the most precious square of sense” shows Shakespeare doing an\nalmost scholastic demonstration of the need for a ratio and interplay among\nthe senses as the very constitution of rationality. His theme in Lear is that\nof John Donne in _An Anatomy of the World:_\n\n’Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone;  \nAll just supply, and all Relation:  \nPrince, subject, Father, Son, are things forgot,  \nFor every man alone things he hath got  \nTo be a Phoenix …\n\nThe breaking of “the most precious square of sense” means the isolation of one\nsense from another by separate intensities with the ensuing irrationality and\nclash among wits and persons and functions. This breaking of the ratios among\nwits (or senses) and persons and functions is the theme of the later\nShakespeare.\n\nAs Cordelia observes the flash agility of those specialists in filial piety,\nGoneril and Regan, she says:\n\n… I am sure my love’s\n\nMore richer than my tongue.\n\nHer rational fulness is as nothing to the specialism of her sisters. She has\nno fixed point of view from which she can launch bolts of eloquence. Her\nsisters are cued for particular occasions, streamlined by fragmentation of\nsense and motive for exact calculation. They are like Lear, _avant-garde_\nMachiavels, able to deal explicitly and scientifically with occasions. They\nare resolute and consciously liberated not only from the square of sense but\nfrom its moral analogate, “conscience.” For that ratio among motives “does\nmake cowards of us all.” And Cordelia is a coward hindered from specialist\naction by the complexities of her conscience, her reason, and her role.\n\n### KING LEAR is a working model of the process of denudation by which men\ntranslated themselves from a world of roles to a world of jobs.\n\n_King Lear_ is a kind of elaborate case history of people translating\nthemselves out of a world of roles into the new world of jobs. This is a\nprocess of stripping and denudation which does not occur instantly except in\nartistic vision. But Shakespeare saw that it had happened in his time. He was\nnot talking about the future. However, the older world of roles had lingered\non as a ghost just as after a century of electricity the West still feels the\npresence of the older values of literacy and privacy and separateness.\n\nKent, Edgar, and Cordelia are “out of phase” in the language of W. B. Yeats.\nThey are “feudal” in their total loyalty which they consider merely natural to\ntheir _roles_. In role they exercise no delegated authority or powers. They\nare autonomous centres. As Georges Poulet in his _Studies in Human Time_\npoints out ([p. 7](ch01.html#page_7)): “For the man of the Middle Ages, then,\nthere was not one duration only. There were _durations_ , ranked one above\nanother, and not only in the universality of the exterior world but within\nhimself, in his own nature, in his own human existence.” The easy habit of\nconfiguration which had lasted through several centuries yields with the\nRenaissance to continuous, lineal, and uniform sequences for time and space\nand personal relationships alike. And the analogous world of roles and ratios\nis suddenly succeeded by a new lineal world, as in _Troilus and Cressida_\n(III, iii):\n\nTake the instant way;\n\nFor honour travels in a strait so narrow  \nWhere one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,  \nFor emulation hath a thousand sons  \nThat one by one pursue. If you give way,  \nOr hedge aside from the direct forthright,  \nLike to an ent’red tide, they all rush by,  \nAnd leave you hindmost;\n\nThe idea of homogeneous segmentation of persons and relations and functions\ncould only appear to the sixteenth century as the dissolution of all bonds of\nsense and reason. _King Lear_ offers a complete demonstration of how it felt\nto live through the change from medieval to Renaissance time and space, from\nan inclusive to an exclusive sense of the world. His changed attitude to\nCordelia exactly reflects the idea of the Reformers concerning fallen nature.\nPoulet says ([p. 10](ch01.html#page_10)):\n\nFor them, too, both man and nature were divinely animated. For them also there\nhad been a time when nature and man had participated in the creative power. …\nBut that time existed for them no longer. The time when nature was divine was\nnow succeeded by the time of fallen nature; fallen by its own fault, by the\nfree act in consequence of which it had separated itself from its origin, cut\nitself off from its source, denied God. And from that moment on, God had\nwithdrawn from nature and from man.\n\nLear is quite explicit in designating Cordelia as a Puritan:\n\nLet pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\n\nThe Reformers in their stress on individual function and independence\nnaturally saw no point in all the formalities that belong to quite impersonal\nroles in society. It is clear to the audience, however, that it is rather\nCordelia’s dedication to her traditional role that makes her so helpless in\nthe presence of the new individualism both of Lear and her sisters:\n\nI love your Majesty\n\nAccording to my bond; no more nor less.\n\nShe well knows that her devoted _role_ adds up to “nothing” in terms of the\nnew shrill and expansive individualism. Poulet describes ([p.\n9](ch01.html#page_9)) this new world as “no longer anything more than an\nimmense organism, a gigantic network of interchanges and reciprocal influences\nwhich was animated, which was guided interiorly in its cyclical development by\na force everywhere the same and perpetually diversified, that could be called\nindiscriminately God, or Nature, or the Soul of the World, or Love.”\n\n### The anguish of the third dimension is given its first\n\nverbal manifestation in poetic history in **KING LEAR**.\n\nShakespeare seems to have missed due recognition for having in _King Lear_\nmade the first, and so far as I know, the only piece of verbal three-\ndimensional perspective in any literature. It is not again until Milton’s\n_Paradise Lost_ (II, 11. 1-5) that a fixed visual point of view is\ndeliberately provided for the reader:\n\nHigh on a Throne of Royal State, which far  \nOutshon the wealth of _Ormus_ and of _Ind_ ,  \nOr where the gorgeous East with richest hand  \nShowrs on her Kings _Barbaric_ Pearl and Gold,  \nSatan exalted sat, …\n\nThe arbitrary selection of a single static position creates a pictorial space\nwith vanishing point. This space can be filled in bit by bit, and is quite\ndifferent from non-pictorial space in which each thing simply resonates or\nmodulates its own space in visually two-dimensional form.\n\nNow the unique piece of three-dimensional verbal art which appears in King\nLear is in Act IV, scene vi. Edgar is at pains to persuade the blinded\nGloucester to believe the illusion that they are at the edge of a steep cliff:\n\n_Edgar._ … Hark, do you hear the sea?  \n_Gloucester_. No, truly.\n\n_Edgar._ Why then, your other senses grow imperfect  \nBy your eyes’ anguish. …  \nCome on, sir; here’s the place. Stand still. How fearful  \nAnd dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!\n\nThe illusion of the third dimension is discussed at length in E. H. Gombrich’s\n_Art and Illusion_. Far from being a normal mode of human vision, three-\ndimensional perspective is a conventionally acquired mode of seeing, as much\nacquired as is the means of recognizing the letters of the alphabet, or of\nfollowing chronological narrative. That it was an acquired illusion\nShakespeare helps us to see by his comments on the other senses in relation to\nsight. Gloucester is ripe for illusion because he has suddenly lost his sight.\nHis power of visualization is now quite separate from his other senses. And it\nis the sense of sight in deliberate isolation from the other senses that\nconfers on man the illusion of the third dimension, as Shakespeare makes\nexplicit here. There is also the need to fix the gaze:\n\nCome on, sir; here’s the place. Stand still. How fearful  \nAnd dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!  \nThe crows and choughs that wing the midway air  \nShow scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down  \nHangs one that gathers sampire – dreadful trade!  \nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.  \nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach,  \nAppear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,  \nDiminish’d to her cock; her cock, a buoy  \nAlmost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,  \nThat on th’ unnumb’red idle pebbles chafes,  \nCannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more,  \nLest my brain turn, and the deficient sight  \nTopple down headlong.\n\nWhat Shakespeare does here is to place five flat panels of two-dimensions, one\nbehind the other. By giving these flat panels a diagonal twist they succeed\neach other, as it were, in a perspective from the “stand still” point. He is\nutterly aware that the disposition to this kind of illusionism results from\nthe separation of the senses. Milton learned to make the same kind of visual\nillusion after his blindness. And by 1709 Bishop Berkeley in his _New Theory\nof Vision_ was denouncing the absurdity of Newtonian visual space as a mere\nabstract illusion severed from the sense of touch. The stripping of the senses\nand the interruption of their interplay in tactile synesthesia may well have\nbeen one of the effects of the Gutenberg technology. This process of\nseparation and reduction of functions had certainly reached a critical point\nby the early seventeenth century when _King Lear_ appeared. But to determine\nhow far such a revolution in the human sense life could have proceeded from\nGutenberg technology calls for a somewhat different approach from merely\nsampling the sensibility of a great play of the critical period.\n\n_King Lear_ is a kind of medieval sermon-exemplum or inductive reasoning to\ndisplay the madness and misery of the new Renaissance life of action.\nShakespeare explains minutely that the very principle of _action_ is the\nsplitting up of social operations and of the private sense life into\nspecialized segments. The resulting frenzy to discover a new over-all\ninterplay of forces ensures a furious activation of all components and persons\naffected by the new stress.\n\nCervantes had a similar awareness, and his _Don Quixote_ is galvanized by the\nnew form of the book as much as Machiavelli had been hypnotized by the special\nsegment of experience that he had chosen to step up to the highest intensity\nof awareness. Machiavelli’s abstraction of the entity of personal power from\nthe social matrix was comparable to the much earlier abstraction of _wheel_\nfrom animal form. Such abstraction ensures a great deal more movement. But the\nShakespeare-Cervantes vision is of the futility of such movement and of action\ndeliberately framed on a fragmentary or specialist bias.\n\nW. B. Yeats has an epigram which puts the themes of _King Lear_ and _Don\nQuixote_ in cryptic form:\n\nLocke sank into a swoon  \nThe garden died  \nGod took the spinning jenny  \nOut of his side.\n\nThe Lockean swoon was the hypnotic trance induced by stepping up the visual\ncomponent in experience until it filled the field of attention. Psychologists\ndefine hypnosis as the filling of the field of attention by one sense only. At\nsuch a moment “the garden” dies. That is, the garden indicates the interplay\nof all the senses in haptic harmony. With the instressed concern with one\nsense only, the mechanical principle of abstraction and repetition emerges\ninto explicit form. Technology is explicitness, as Lyman Bryson said. And\nexplicitness means the spelling out of one thing at a time, one sense at a\ntime, one mental or physical operation at a time. Since the object of the\npresent book is to discern the origins and modes of the Gutenberg\nconfiguration of events, it will be well to consider the effects of the\nalphabet on native populations today. For as they _are_ in relation to the\nphonetic alphabet, so we once _were_.\n\n### The interiorization of the technology of the phonetic alphabet translates\nman from the magical world of the ear to the neutral visual world.\n\nJ. C. Carothers, writing in _Psychiatry_ (November, 1959) on “Culture,\nPsychiatry and the Written Word,” set forth a number of observations\ncontrasting non-literate natives with literate natives, and the non-literate\nman with the Western man generally. He starts ([p. 308](ch03.html#page_308))\nwith the familiar fact that\n\nby reason of the type of educational influences that impinge upon Africans in\ninfancy and early childhood, and indeed throughout their lives, a man comes to\nregard himself as a rather insignificant part of a much larger organism – the\nfamily and the clan – and not as an independent, self-reliant unit; personal\ninitiative and ambition are permitted little outlet; and a meaningful\nintegration of a man’s experience on individual, personal lines is not\nachieved. By contrast to the constriction at the intellectual level, great\nfreedom is allowed for at the temperamental level, and a man is expected to\nlive very much in the ‘here and now,’ to be highly extraverted, and to give\nvery free expression to his feelings.\n\nIn a word, our notions of the “uninhibited” native ignore the utter inhibition\nand suppression of his mental and personal life which is unavoidable in a non-\nliterate world:\n\nWhereas the Western child is early introduced to building blocks, keys in\nlocks, water taps, and a multiplicity of items and events which constrain him\nto think in terms of spatiotemporal relations and mechanical causation, the\nAfrican child receives instead an education which depends much more\nexclusively on the spoken word and which is relatively highly charged with\ndrama and emotion. ([p. 308](ch03.html#page_308))\n\nThat is, a child in any Western milieu is surrounded by an abstract explicit\nvisual technology of uniform time and uniform continuous space in which\n“cause” is efficient and sequential, and things move and happen on single\nplanes and in successive order. But the African child lives in the implicit,\nmagical world of the resonant oral word. He encounters not efficient causes\nbut formal causes of configurational field such as any non-literate society\ncultivates. Carothers repeats again and again that “rural Africans live\nlargely in a world of sound – a world loaded with direct personal significance\nfor the hearer – whereas the Western European lives much more in a visual\nworld which is on the whole indifferent to him.” Since the ear world is a hot\nhyperesthetic world and the eye world is relatively a cool, neutral world, the\nWesterner appears to people of ear culture to be a very cold fish\nindeed.[2](ch02a_fn02.html#ch02a_fn02fn2)\n\nCarothers reviews the familiar non-literate idea of the “power” of words where\nthought and behaviour depend upon the magical resonance in words and their\npower to impose their assumptions relentlessly. He cites Kenyatta concerning\nlove magic among the Kikuyu:\n\nIt is very important to acquire the correct use of magical words and their\nproper intonations, for the progress in applying magic effectively depends on\nuttering these words in their ritual order. … In performing these acts of love\nmagic the performer has to recite a magical formula. … After this recitation\nhe calls the name of the girl loudly and starts to address her _as though she\nwere listening_. ([p. 309](ch03.html#page_309))\n\nIt is a matter of “rite words in rote order,” as Joyce put it. But once more\nany Western child today grows up in this kind of magical repetitive world as\nhe hears advertisements on radio and TV.\n\nCarothers next asks ([p. 310](ch03.html#page_310)) how literacy in a society\nmight operate to effect the change from the notion of words as resonant, live,\nactive, natural forces to the notion of words as “meaning” or “significance”\nfor minds:\n\nI suggest that it was only when the written, and still more the printed, word\nappeared on the scene that the stage was set for words to lose their magic\npowers and vulnerabilities. Why so?\n\nI developed the theme in an earlier article with reference to Africa, that the\nnonliterate rural population lives largely in a world of sound, in contrast to\nwestern Europeans who live largely in a world of vision. Sounds are in a sense\ndynamic things, or at least are always indicators of dynamic things – of\nmovements, events, activities, for which man, when largely unprotected from\nthe hazards of life in the bush or the veldt, must be ever on the alert. …\nSounds lose much of this significance in western Europe, where man often\ndevelops, and must develop, a remarkable ability to disregard them. Whereas\nfor Europeans, in general, “seeing is believing,” for rural Africans reality\nseems to reside far more in what is heard and what is said.\n\n… Indeed, one is constrained to believe that the eye is regarded by many\nAfricans less as a receiving organ than as an instrument of the will, the ear\nbeing the main receiving organ.\n\nCarothers reiterates that the Westerner depends on a high degree of visual\nshaping of spatio-temporal relations without which it is impossible to have\nthe mechanistic sense of causal relations so necessary to the order of our\nlives. But the quite different assumptions of native perceptual life have led\nhim to ask ([p. 311](ch03.html#page_311)) what has been the possible role of\nwritten words in shifting habits of perception from the auditory to visual\nstress:\n\nWhen words are written, they become, of course, a part of the visual world.\nLike most of the elements of the visual world, they become static things and\nlose, as such, the dynamism which is so characteristic of the auditory world\nin general, and of the spoken word in particular. They lose much of the\npersonal element, in the sense that the heard word is most commonly directed\nat oneself, whereas the seen word most commonly is not, and can be read or not\nas whim dictates. They lose those emotional overtones and emphases which have\nbeen described, for instance, by Monrad-Krohn … Thus, in general, words, by\nbecoming visible, join a world of relative indifference to the viewer – a\nworld from which the magic “power” of the word has been abstracted.\n\nCarothers continues his observations into the area of “free ideation”\npermitted to literate societies and quite out of the question for oral, non-\nliterate communities:\n\nThe concept that verbal thought is separable from action, and is, or can be,\nineffective and contained within the man … has important sociocultural\nimplications, for it is only in societies which recognize that verbal thoughts\ncan be so contained, and do not of their nature emerge on wings of power, that\nsocial constraints can, in theory at least, afford to ignore ideation. ([p.\n311](ch03.html#page_311))\n\nThus, in a society still so profoundly oral as Russia, where spying is done by\near and not by eye, at the memorable “purge” trials of the 1930’s Westerners\nexpressed bafflement that many confessed total guilt not because of what they\nhad done but what they had thought. In a highly literate society, then, visual\nand behavioural conformity frees the individual for inner deviation. Not so in\nan oral society where inner verbalization is effective social action:\n\nIn these circumstances it is implicit that behavioural constraints _must_\ninclude constraint of thought. Since all behaviour in such societies is\ngoverned and conceived on highly social lines, and since directed thinking can\nhardly be other than personal and unique for each individual, it is\nfurthermore implicit in the attitude of these societies that the very\npossibility of such thinking is hardly to be recognized. Therefore, if and\nwhen such thinking does occur, at other than strictly practical and\nutilitarian levels, it is apt to be seen as deriving from the devil or from\nother external evil influences, and as something to be feared and shunned as\nmuch in oneself as in others. ([p. 312](ch03.html#page_312))\n\nIt is, perhaps, a little unexpected to hear the compulsive and rigid patterns\nof a deeply oral-aural community referred to as “governed and conceived on\nhighly social lines.” For nothing can exceed the automatism and rigidity of an\noral, non-literate community in its non-personal collectivity. As Western\nliterate communities encounter the various “primitive” or auditory communities\nstill remaining in the world, great confusion occurs. Areas like China and\nIndia are still audile-tactile in the main. Such phonetic literacy as has\npenetrated there has altered very little. Even Russia is still profoundly oral\nin bias. Only gradually does literacy alter substructures of language and\nsensibility.\n\nAlexander Inkeles in his book on _Public Opinion in Russia_ ([p.\n137](ch02a.html#page_137)) gives a useful account of how the ordinary and\nunconscious bias, even of the Russian literate groups, has a direction quite\ncounter to anything a long-literate community would consider “natural.” The\nRussian attitude, like that of any oral society, reverses our stress:\n\nIn the United States and England it is the freedom of expression, the right\nitself in the abstract, that is valued. … In the Soviet Union, on the other\nhand, the _results_ of exercising freedom are in the forefront of attention,\nand the preoccupation with the freedom itself is secondary. It is for this\nreason that the discussions between Soviet and Anglo-American representatives\ncharacteristically reach absolutely no agreement on specific proposals,\nalthough both sides assert that there should be freedom of the press. The\nAmerican is usually talking about freedom of _expression_ , the right to say\nor not to say certain things, a right which he claims exists in the United\nStates and not in the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative is usually\ntalking about _access_ to the _means_ of expression, not to the right to say\nthings at all, and this access he maintains is denied to most in the United\nStates and exists for most in the Soviet Union.\n\nSoviet concern with media _results_ is natural to any oral society where\ninterdependence is the result of instant interplay of cause and effect in the\ntotal structure. Such is the character of a village, or, since electric media,\nsuch is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR\ncommunity that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global\ninterdependence. Like the Soviet Union, they are concerned about _access_ to\nthe media and about _results_. They have no concern whatever about self-\nexpression and would be shocked by any attempt to take over, say, a public\nadvertisement for oil or coke as a vehicle of private opinion or personal\nfeeling. In the same way the literate bureaucrats of the Soviet Union cannot\nimagine anybody wanting to use public media in a private way. And this\nattitude has just nothing to do with Marx, Lenin, or Communism. It is a normal\ntribal attitude of any oral society. The Soviet press is their equivalent of\nour Madison Avenue in shaping production and social processes.\n\n### Schizophrenia may be a necessary consequence of literacy.\n\nCarothers stresses that until phonetic writing split apart thought and action,\nthere was no alternative but to hold all men responsible for their thoughts as\nmuch as their actions. His great contribution has been to point to the\nbreaking apart of the magical world of the ear and the neutral world of the\neye, and to the emergence of the detribalized individual from this split. It\nfollows, of course, that literate man, when we meet him in the Greek world, is\na split man, a schizophrenic, as all literate men have been since the\ninvention of the phonetic alphabet. Mere writing, however, has not the\npeculiar power of the phonetic technology to detribalize man. Given the\nphonetic alphabet with its abstraction of meaning from sound and the\ntranslation of sound into a visual code, and men were at grips with an\nexperience that transformed them. No pictographic or ideogrammic or\nhieroglyphic mode of writing has the detribalizing power of the phonetic\nalphabet. No other kind of writing save the phonetic has ever translated man\nout of the possessive world of total interdependence and interrelation that is\nthe auditory network. From that magical resonating world of simultaneous\nrelations that is the oral and acoustic space there is only one route to the\nfreedom and independence of detribalized man. That route is _via_ the phonetic\nalphabet, which lands men at once in varying degrees of dualistic\nschizophrenia. Here is how Bertrand Russell describes (in his _History of\nWestern Philosophy_ , [p. 39](ch02.html#page_39)) this condition of the Greek\nworld in the early throes of dichotomy and the trauma of literacy:\n\nNot all of the Greeks, but a large proportion of them, were passionate,\nunhappy, at war with themselves, driven along one road by the intellect and\nalong another by the passions, with the imagination to conceive heaven and the\nwilful self-assertion that creates hell. They had a maxim “nothing too much,”\nbut they were in fact excessive in everything – in pure thought, in poetry, in\nreligion, and in sin. It was the combination of passion and intellect that\nmade them great, while they were great. … There were, in fact, two tendencies\nin Greece, one passionate, religious, mystical, other worldly, the other\ncheerful, empirical, rationalistic, and interested in acquiring knowledge of a\ndiversity of facts.\n\nThe division of faculties which results from the technological dilation or\nexternalization of one or another sense is so pervasive a feature of the past\ncentury that today we have become conscious, for the first time in history, of\nhow these mutations of culture are initiated. Those who experience the first\nonset of a new technology, whether it be alphabet or radio, respond most\nemphatically because the new sense ratios set up at once by the technological\ndilation of eye or ear, present men with a surprising new world, which evokes\na vigorous new “closure,” or novel pattern of interplay, among all of the\nsenses together. But the initial shock gradually dissipates as the entire\ncommunity absorbs the new habit of perception into all of its areas of work\nand association. But the real revolution is in this later and prolonged phase\nof “adjustment” of all personal and social life to the new model of perception\nset up by the new technology.\n\nThe Romans carried out the alphabetic translation of culture into visual\nterms. The Greeks, whether ancient or Byzantine, clung to much of the older\noral culture with its distrust of action and applied knowledge. For applied\nknowledge, whether in military structure or industrial organization, depends\nupon uniformity and homogenization of populations. “It is certain,” wrote the\nsymbolist Edgar Allan Poe, “that the mere act of inditing tends in a great\ndegree to the logicalization of thought.” Lineal, alphabetic inditing made\npossible the sudden invention of “grammars” of thought and science by the\nGreeks. These grammars or explicit spellings out of personal and social\nprocesses were visualizations of non-visual functions and relations. The\nfunctions and processes were not new. But the means of arrested visual\nanalysis, namely the phonetic alphabet, was as new to the Greeks as the movie\ncamera in our century.\n\nWe can ask ourselves later why the fanatic specialism of the Phoenicians,\nwhich hacked the alphabet out of the hieroglyphic culture, did not release any\nfurther intellectual or artistic activity in them. Meantime, it is relevant to\nnote that Cicero, the encyclopedic synthesizer of the Roman world, when\nsurveying the Greek world, reproves Socrates for having been the first to make\na split between mind and heart. The pre-Socratics were still mainly in a non-\nliterate culture. Socrates stood on the border between that oral world and the\nvisual and literate culture. But he wrote nothing. The Middle Ages regarded\nPlato as the mere scribe or amanuensis of Socrates. And Aquinas considered\nthat neither Socrates nor Our Lord committed their teaching to writing because\nthe kind of interplay of minds that is in teaching is not possible by means of\nwriting.[3](ch02a_fn03.html#ch02a_fn03fn3)\n\n### Does the interiorization of media such as LETTERS alter the ratio among\nour senses and change mental processes?\n\nWhat concerned Cicero, the practical Roman, was that the Greeks had put\ndifficulties in the way of his own program for the _doctus orator_. In\nchapters xv–xxiii of the third book of the _De oratore_ , he offers a history\nof philosophy from the beginning to his own time, trying to explain how it\ncame about that the professional philosophers had made a breach between\neloquence and wisdom, between practical knowledge and knowledge which these\nmen professed to follow for its own sake. Before Socrates learning had been\nthe preceptress of living rightly and speaking well. But with Socrates came\nthe division between the tongue and the heart. That the eloquent Socrates\nshould have been of all people the one to initiate a division between thinking\nwisely and speaking well was inexplicable: “… quorum princeps Socrates fuit,\nis, qui omnium eruditorum testimonio totiusque judicio Graeciae cum prudentia\net acumine et venustate et subtilitate, tum vero eloquentia, varietate, copia,\nquam se cumque in partem dedisset omnium fuit facile princeps …”\n\nBut after Socrates things became much worse in Cicero’s opinion. The Stoics\ndespite a refusal to cultivate eloquence, have alone of all the philosophers\ndeclared eloquence to be a virtue and wisdom. For Cicero, wisdom is eloquence\nbecause only by eloquence can knowledge be applied to the minds and hearts of\nmen. It is applied knowledge that obsesses the mind of Cicero the Roman as it\ndid the mind of Francis Bacon. And for Cicero, as for Bacon, the technique of\napplication depends upon the Roman brick procedure of uniform repeatability\nand homogeneous segments of knowledge.\n\nIf a technology is introduced either from within or from without a culture,\nand if it gives new stress or ascendancy to one or another of our senses, the\nratio among all of our senses is altered. We no longer feel the same, nor do\nour eyes and ears and other senses remain the same. The interplay among our\nsenses is perpetual save in conditions of anesthesia. But any sense when\nstepped up to high intensity can act as an anesthetic for other senses. The\ndentist can now use “audiac” – induced noise – to remove tactility. Hypnosis\ndepends on the same principle of isolating one sense in order to anesthetize\nthe others. The result is a break in the ratio among the senses, a kind of\nloss of identity. Tribal, non-literate man, living under the intense stress on\nauditory organization of all experience, is, as it were, entranced.\n\nPlato, however, the scribe of Socrates as he seemed to the Middle Ages, could\nin the act of writing[4](ch02a_fn04.html#ch02a_fn04fn4) look back to the non-\nliterate world and say:\n\nIt would take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in praise\nor blame of the various arts. But when they came to letters, This, said\nTheuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a\nspecific both for the memory and for the wit. Thamus replied: O most ingenious\nTheuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the\nutility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them. And in this\ninstance, you who are the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own\nchildren have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot have;\nfor this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls,\nbecause they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external\nwritten characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have\ndiscovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your\ndisciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of\nmany things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient\nand will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the\nshow of wisdom without the reality.\n\nPlato shows no awareness here or elsewhere of how the phonetic alphabet had\naltered the sensibility of the Greeks; nor did anybody else in his time or\nlater. Before his time, the myth-makers, poised on the frontiers between the\nold oral world of the tribe and the new technologies of specialism and\nindividualism, had foreseen all and said all in a few words. The myth of\nCadmus states how this King who had introduced the Phoenician script, or the\nphonetic alphabet to Greece, had sown the dragon’s teeth and they had sprung\nup armed men. This, as with all myth, is a succinct statement of a complex\nsocial process that had occurred over a period of centuries. But it was only\nin recent years that the work of Harold Innis opened up the Cadmus myth fully.\n(See, for example, _The Bias of Communication_ and _Empire and\nCommunications_.) The myth, like the aphorism and maxim, is characteristic of\noral culture. For, until literacy deprives language of his multi-dimensional\nresonance, every word is a poetic world unto itself, a “momentary deity” or\nrevelation, as it seemed to non-literate men. Ernst Cassirer’s _Language and\nMyth_ presents this aspect of non-literate human awareness, surveying the wide\nrange of current study of language origins and development. Towards the end of\nthe nineteenth century numerous students of non-literate societies had begun\nto have doubts about the _a priori_ character of logical categories. Today,\nwhen the role of phonetic literacy in the creating of the techniques of\nenunciation of propositions (“formal logic”) is well known, it is still\nsupposed, even by some anthropologists, that Euclidean space and three-\ndimensional visual perception is a universal datum of mankind. The absence of\nsuch space in native art is considered by such scholars to be owing to lack of\nartistic skill. Cassirer, reporting on the notion of words as myth (the\netymology of _mythos_ indicates that it means “word”) says ([p.\n62](ch02.html#page_62)):\n\nAccording to Usener, the lowest level to which we can trace back the origin of\nreligious concepts is that of “momentary gods,” as he calls those images which\nare born from the need or the specific feeling of a critical moment … and\nstill bearing the mark of all its pristine volatility and freedom. But it\nappears that the new findings which ethnology and comparative religion have\nput at our disposal during the three decades since the publication of Usener’s\nwork enable us to go back one step further yet.\n\n### Civilization\n\ngives the barbarian or tribal man an eye for an ear and is now at odds with\nthe electronic world.\n\nThis step takes to a more generalized sense of the manifestations of divine\npotency, away from particular, individualized “archetypes” and epiphanies of\n“momentary deities.” It must often have puzzled the scholars and physicists of\nour time that just in the degree to which we penetrate the lowest layers of\nnon-literate awareness we encounter the most advanced and sophisticated ideas\nof twentieth-century art and science. To explain that paradox will be an\naspect of the present book. It is a theme around which much emotion and\ncontroversy are daily engendered as our world shifts from a visual to an\nauditory orientation in its electric technology. The controversy, of course,\nignores the cause of the process altogether and clings to the “content.”\nSetting aside the effects of the alphabet in creating Euclidean space for the\nGreek sensibility, as well as the simultaneous discovery of perspective and\nchronological narrative, it will be necessary to return briefly to the native\nworld with J.C. Carothers. For it is in the non-literate world that it is\neasiest to discern the operation of phonetic letters in shaping our Western\nworld.\n\nThat the Greeks were able to do more with the written word than other\ncommunities such as the Babylonian and Egyptian was, according to H. A. L.\nFisher (_A History of Europe_ , [p. 19](ch02.html#page_19)) that they were not\nunder “the paralysing control of organized priestcraft.” But even so, they had\nonly a brief period of exploration and discovery before settling into a\n_clichéd_ pattern of repetitive thought. Carothers feels that the early Greek\nintelligentsia not only had the stimulus of sudden access to the acquired\nwisdom of other peoples, but, having none of its own, there were no vested\ninterests in acquired knowledge to frustrate the immediate acceptance and\ndevelopment of the new. It is this very situation which today puts the Western\nworld at such a disadvantage, as against the “backward” countries. It is our\nenormous backlog of literate and mechanistic technology that renders us so\nhelpless and inept in handling the new electric technology. The new physics is\nan auditory domain and long-literate society is not at home in the new\nphysics, nor will it ever be.\n\nThis, of course, is to overlook the utter discrepancy between the phonetic\nalphabet and any other kind of writing whatever. Only the phonetic alphabet\nmakes a break between eye and ear, between semantic meaning and visual code;\nand thus only phonetic writing has the power to translate man from the tribal\nto the civilized sphere, to give him an eye for an ear. The Chinese culture is\nconsiderably more refined and perceptive than the Western world has ever been.\nBut the Chinese are tribal, people of the ear. “Civilization” must now be used\ntechnically to mean detribalized man for whom the visual values have priority\nin the organization of thought and action. Nor is this to give any new meaning\nor value to “civilization” but rather to specify its character. It is quite\nobvious that most civilized people are crude and numb in their perceptions,\ncompared with the hyperesthesia of oral and auditory cultures. For the eye has\nnone of the delicacy of the ear. Carothers goes on ([p.\n313](ch03.html#page_313)) to observe that:\n\nSo far as Plato’s thinking can be considered representative of the thinking of\nthe Greeks, it is very clear that the word, whether thought or written, still\nretained, for them, and from our point of view, vast powers in the ‘real’\nworld. Although at last it was seen as nonbehavioural itself, it now came to\nbe regarded as the fount and origin not only of behaviour but of all\ndiscovery: it was the only key to knowledge, and thought alone – in words or\nfigures – could unlock all doors for understanding the world. In a sense,\nindeed, the power of words or other visual symbols became greater than before\n… now verbal and mathematical thought became the only truth, and the whole\nsensory world came to be regarded as illusory, except insofar as thoughts were\nheard or seen.\n\nIn his dialogue of the _Cratylus_ , named for his teacher of language and\ngrammar, Plato has Socrates say (438):\n\nBut if these things are only to be known through names, how can we suppose\nthat the givers of names had knowledge, or were legislators before there were\nnames at all, and therefore before they could have known them?\n\n_Cratylus_ : I believe, Socrates, the true account of the matter to be, that a\npower more than human gave things their first names, and that the names which\nwere thus given are necessarily their true names.\n\nThis view of Cratylus was the basis of most language study until the\nRenaissance. It is rooted in the old oral “magic” of the “momentary deity”\nkind such as is favoured again today for various reasons. That it is most\nalien to merely literary and visual culture is easily found in the remarks of\nincredulity which Jowett supplies as his contribution to the dialogue.\n\nCarothers turns to David Riesman’s _The Lonely Crowd_ ([p.\n9](ch01.html#page_9)) for further orientation in his queries concerning the\neffects of writing on non-literate communities. Riesman had characterized our\nown Western world as developing in its “typical members a social character\nwhose conformity is insured by their tendency to acquire early in life an\ninternalized set of goals.” Ries-man made no effort to discover why the\nmanuscript culture of the ancient and medieval worlds should not have\nconferred inner direction, nor why a print culture should inevitably confer\ninner direction. That is part of the business of the present book. But it can\nbe said at once that “inner direction” depends upon a “fixed point of view.” A\nstable, consistent character is one with an unwavering outlook, an almost\nhypnotized visual stance, as it were. Manuscripts were altogether too slow and\nuneven a matter to provide either a fixed point of view or the habit of\ngliding steadily on single planes of thought and information. As we shall see,\nmanuscript culture is intensely audile-tactile compared to print culture; and\nthat means that detached habits of observation are quite uncongenial to\nmanuscript cultures, whether ancient Egyptian, Greek, or Chinese or medieval.\nIn place of cool visual detachment the manuscript world puts empathy and\nparticipation of all the senses. But non-literate cultures experience such an\noverwhelming tyranny of the ear over the eye that any balanced interplay among\nthe senses is unknown at the auditory extreme, just as balanced interplay of\nthe senses became extremely difficult after print stepped up the visual\ncomponent in Western experience to extreme intensity.\n\n### The modern physicist is at home with oriental field theory.\n\nCarothers finds Riesman’s classification of “tradition-directed” peoples as\ncorresponding “quite closely to those areas occupied by societies which are\nnon-literate or in which the great majority of the population has been\nuntouched by literacy” ([p. 315](ch03.html#page_315)). It should be understood\nthat to be “touched” by literacy is not a very sudden affair, nor is it a\ntotal matter at any time or in any place. That should become very clear as we\nmove through the sixteenth and later centuries. But today, as electricity\ncreates conditions of extreme interdependence on a global scale, we move\nswiftly again into an auditory world of simultaneous events and over-all\nawareness. Yet the habits of literacy persist in our speech, our\nsensibilities, and in our arrangement of the spaces and times of our daily\nlives. Short of some catastrophe, literacy and visual bias could bear up for a\nlong time against electricity and “unified field” awareness. And the same is\ntrue the other way around. Germans and the Japanese, while far-advanced in\nliterate and analytic technology, retained the core of auditory tribal unity\nand total togetherness. The advent of radio, and electricity generally, was\nnot only for them but for all tribal cultures a most intense experience. Long-\nliterate cultures have naturally more resistance to the auditory dynamic of\nthe total electric field culture of our time.\n\nRiesman, referring to tradition-directed people, says ([p.\n26](ch02.html#page_26)):\n\nSince the type of social order we have been discussing is relatively\nunchanging, the conformity of the individual tends to be dictated to a very\nlarge degree by power relations among the various age and sex groups, the\nclans, castes, professions, and so forth – relations which have endured for\ncenturies and are modified but slightly, if at all, by successive generations.\nThe culture controls behavior minutely, and, … careful and rigid etiquette\ngoverns the fundamentally influential sphere of kin relationships. … Little\nenergy is directed toward finding new solutions of the age-old problems …\n\nRiesman points out that to meet even the rigid demands of complex religious\nritual and etiquette “individuality of character need not be highly\ndeveloped.” He speaks as a highly literate man for whom “development” means\nhaving a private point of view. High development as it might appear to a\nnative would not be accessible to our visual mode of awareness. We can get\nsome idea of the attitude of a member of a tradition-directed society to\ntechnological improvements from a story related by Werner Heisenberg in _The\nPhysicist’s Conception of Nature_. A modern physicist with his habit of\n“field” perception, and his sophisticated separation from our conventional\nhabits of Newtonian space, easily finds in the pre-literate world a congenial\nkind of wisdom.\n\nHeisenberg is discussing “science as a part of the interplay between man and\nNature” ([p. 20](ch02.html#page_20)):\n\nIn this connection it has often been said that the far-reaching changes in our\nenvironment and in our way of life wrought by this technical age have also\nchanged dangerously our ways of thinking, and that here lie the roots of the\ncrises which have shaken our times and which, for instance, are also expressed\nin modern art. True, this objection is much older than modern technology and\nscience, the use of implements going back to man’s earliest beginnings. Thus,\ntwo and a half thousand years ago, the Chinese sage Chuang-Tzu spoke of the\ndanger of the machine when he said:\n\n“As Tzu-Gung was travelling through the regions north of the river Han, he saw\nan old man working in his vegetable garden. He had dug an irrigation ditch.\nThe man would descend into the well, fetch up a vessel of water in his arms\nand pour it out into the ditch. While his efforts were tremendous the results\nappeared to be very meagre.\n\n“Tzu-Gung said, ‘There is a way whereby you can irrigate a hundred ditches in\none day, and whereby you can do much with little effort. Would you not like to\nhear of it?’ Then the gardener stood up, looked at him and said, ‘And what\nwould that be?’\n\n“Tzu-Gung replied, ‘You take a wooden lever, weighted at the back and light in\nfront. In this way you can bring up water so quickly that it just gushes out.\nThis is called a draw-well.’\n\n“Then anger rose up in the old man’s face, and he said, ‘I have heard my\nteacher say that whoever uses machines does all his work like a machine. He\nwho does his work like a machine grows a heart like a machine, and he who\ncarries the heart of a machine in his breast loses his simplicity. He who has\nlost his simplicity becomes unsure in the strivings of his soul. Uncertainty\nin the strivings of the soul is something which does not agree with honest\nsense. It is not that I do not know of such things; I am ashamed to use\nthem.’”\n\nClearly this ancient tale contains a great deal of wisdom, for “uncertainty in\nthe strivings of the soul” is perhaps one of the aptest descriptions of man’s\ncondition in our modern crisis; technology, the machine, has spread through\nthe world to a degree that our Chinese sage could not even have suspected.\n\nThe sort of “simplicity” envisaged by the sage is a more complex and subtle\nproduct than anything that occurs in a society with specialized technology and\nsense life. But perhaps the real point of the anecdote is that it appealed to\nHeisenberg. It would not have interested Newton. Not only does modern physics\nabandon the specialized visual space of Descartes and Newton, it re-enters the\nsubtle auditory space of the non-literate world. And in the most primitive\nsociety, as in the present age, such auditory space is a total field of\nsimultaneous relations in which “change” has as little meaning and appeal as\nit had for the mind of Shakespeare or the heart of Cervantes. All values\napart, we must learn today that our electric technology has consequences for\nour most ordinary perceptions and habits of action which are quickly\nrecreating in us the mental processes of the most primitive men. These\nconsequences occur, not in our thoughts or opinions, where we are trained to\nbe critical, but in our most ordinary sense life, which creates the vortices\nand the matrices of thought and action. This book will try to explain why\nprint culture confers on man a language of thought which leaves him quite\nunready to face the language of his own electro-magnetic technology. The\nstrategy any culture must resort to in a period like this was indicated by\nWilhelm von Humboldt:\n\nMan lives with his objects chiefly – in fact, since his feeling and acting\ndepends on his perceptions, one may say exclusively – as language presents\nthem to him. By the same process whereby he spins language out of his own\nbeing, he ensnares himself in it; and each language draws a magic circle round\nthe people to which it belongs, a circle from which there is no escape save by\nstepping out of it into another.[5](ch02a_fn05.html#ch02a_fn05fn5)\n\nSuch awareness as this has generated in our time the technique of the\nsuspended judgment by which we can transcend the limitations of our own\nassumptions by a critique of them. We can now live, not just amphibiously in\ndivided and distinguished worlds, but pluralistically in many worlds and\ncultures simultaneously. We are no more committed to one culture – to a single\nratio among the human senses – any more than to one book or to one language or\nto one technology. Our need today is, culturally, the same as the scientist’s\nwho seeks to become aware of the bias of the instruments of research in order\nto correct that bias. Compartmentalizing of human potential by single cultures\nwill soon be as absurd as specialism in subject or discipline has become. It\nis not likely that our age is more obsessional than any other, but it has\nbecome sensitively aware of the conditions and fact of obsession beyond any\nother age. However, our fascination with all phases of the unconscious,\npersonal and collective, as with all modes of primitive awareness, began in\nthe eighteenth century with the first violent revulsion against print culture\nand mechanical industry. What began as a “Romantic reaction” towards organic\nwholeness may or may not have hastened the discovery of electro-magnetic\nwaves. But certainly the electro-magnetic discoveries have recreated the\nsimultaneous “field” in all human affairs so that the human family now exists\nunder conditions of a “global village.” We live in a single constricted space\nresonant with tribal drums. So that concern with the “primitive” today is as\nbanal as nineteenth-century concern with “progress,” and as irrelevant to our\nproblems.\n\n### The new electronic interdependence recreates the world in the image of a\nglobal village.\n\nIt would be surprising, indeed, if Riesman’s description of tradition-directed\npeople did not correspond to Carothers’ knowledge of African tribal societies.\nIt would be equally startling were the ordinary reader about native societies\nnot able to vibrate with a deep sense of affinity for the same, since our new\nelectric culture provides our lives again with a tribal base. There is\navailable the lyrical testimony of a very Romantic biologist, Pierre Teilhard\nde Chardin, in his _Phenomenon of Man_ ([p. 240](ch02b.html#page_240)):\n\nNow, to the degree that – under the effect of this pressure and thanks to\ntheir psychic permeability – the human elements infiltrated more and more into\neach other, their minds (mysterious coincidence) were mutually stimulated by\nproximity. And as though dilated upon themselves, they each extended little by\nlittle the radius of their influence upon this earth which, by the same token,\nshrank steadily. What, in fact, do we see happening in the modern paroxysm? It\nhas been stated over and over again. Through the discovery yesterday of the\nrailway, the motor car and the aeroplane, the physical influence of each man,\nformerly restricted to a few miles, now extends to hundreds of leagues or\nmore. Better still: thanks to the prodigious biological event represented by\nthe discovery of electro-magnetic waves, each individual finds himself\nhenceforth (actively and passively) simultaneously present, over land and sea,\nin every corner of the earth.\n\nPeople of literary and critical bias find the shrill vehemence of de Chardin\nas disconcerting as his uncritical enthusiasm for the cosmic membrane that has\nbeen snapped round the globe by the electric dilation of our various senses.\nThis externalization of our senses creates what de Chardin calls the\n“noosphere” or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards\na vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic\nbrain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses\nhave gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this\ndynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly\nbefitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and\nsuperimposed co-existence. It is easy to perceive signs of such panic in\nJacques Barzun who manifests himself as a fearless and ferocious Luddite in\nhis _The House of the Intellect_. Sensing that all he holds dear stems from\nthe operation of the alphabet on and through our minds, he proposes the\nabolition of all modern art, science, and philanthropy. This trio extirpated,\nhe feels we can slap down the lid on Pandora’s box. At least Barzun localizes\nhis problem even if he has no clue as to the kind of agency exerted by these\nforms. Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything\naffects everything all the time.\n\nReverting to the earlier theme of conformity, Carothers continues ([pp.\n315](ch03.html#page_315)–16): “Thought and behavior are not seen as separate;\nthey are both seen as behavioral. Evil-willing is, after all the most fearful\ntype of “behavior” known in many of these societies, and a dormant or\nawakening fear of it lies ever in the minds of all their members.” In our long\nstriving to recover for the Western world a unity of sensibility and of\nthought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal\nconsequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the\nhuman psyche by print culture.\n\n### Literacy affects the physiology as well as the psychic life of the\nAfrican.\n\nCarothers concludes his discussion of the effects of phonetic writing on\nAfricans with an excerpt ([pp. 317](ch04.html#page_317)–18) from an article\nthat appeared in a Kenya daily newspaper, the _East African Standard_. The\nauthor, a missionary doctor, headed his article “How Civilization Has Affected\nthe African.”\n\nThe purpose of this article is to show that through a very little education a\nremarkably rapid and far-reaching change has taken place in African boys and\ngirls, so much so that in a generation, human characteristics and reactions\nhave altered to a degree which one would have expected to have taken\ncenturies.\n\nThe high qualities of the African untouched by missions or education impress\nnearly everyone. Those of this district are good workers, cheerful,\nuncomplaining, unaffected by monotony or discomforts, honest and usually\nremarkably truthful. But it is not uncommon to hear uncomplimentary\ncomparisons made between those Africans and those born of Christian parents or\nthose who started school at an early age. A writer, however, who visited\nschools in Madagascar says that these untouched children are naturally\nlethargic. They sit still too long: the impulse to play seems to be dormant.\nThey are impervious to monotony and their mental lethargy enables them to\nperform, for children, prodigious acts of endurance. These children naturally\ndevelop into the uneducated African, who is incapable of filling any skilled\npost. At the most he can be trained to carry out work that requires no\nreasoning. That is the penalty paid for his good qualities.\n\nThe African will remain in permanent servitude if only to ignorance unless\nthere is willingness to risk the destruction of those qualities in the changes\neducation brings and a desire to face building up his character again but with\na totally different mentality. This different mentality may show itself in a\nshirking of work, trouble over food or in a desire to have his wife living\nwith him however difficult for the employer. The reasons are clear; the\nAfrican’s whole capacity for interest, pleasure and pain are immensely\nincreased through even a little education.\n\nFor the educated African (using this term for even the comparatively low\nstandard achieved by the average African schoolboy) the sense of interest has\nbeen aroused through the new variety of life and monotony has become a trial\nto him as it is to the normal European. It takes greater will-power for him to\nbe faithful to uninteresting work, and lack of interest brings fatigue.\n\nThe author next turned to the changed attitudes to taste and sex and pain\nresulting from literacy:\n\nI suggest also that the nervous system of the untouched African is so\nlethargic that he needs little sleep. Many of our workmen walk some miles to\ntheir jobs, work well all day and then return home and spend most of the night\nsitting up guarding their gardens against the depredations of wild pigs. For\nweeks on end they sleep only two or three hours a night.\n\nThe important moral inference from all this is that the African of the old\ngeneration with whom we have nearly all worked, will never be seen again. The\nnew generation is completely different, capable of rising to greater heights\nand of descending to greater depths. They deserve a more sympathetic knowledge\nof their difficulties and their far greater temptations. African parents need\nto be taught this before it is too late so that they may realize that they are\ndealing with finer bits of mechanism than they themselves were.\n\nCarothers stresses the fact that it is indeed a very little literacy that\nproduces these effects, “some familiarity with written symbols – in reading,\nwriting and arithmetic.”\n\nFinally ([p. 318](ch04.html#page_318)), Carothers turns for a moment to China,\nwhere printing had been invented in the seventh or eighth century and yet\n“seems to have had little effect in emancipating thought.” He calls in the\ntestimony of Kenneth Scott Latourette, who writes in _The Chinese, Their\nHistory and Culture_ ([p. 310](ch03.html#page_310)):\n\nThe hypothetical visitor from Mars might well have expected the Industrial\nRevolution and the modern scientific approach to have made their first\nappearance in China rather than the Occident. The Chinese are so industrious,\nand have shown such ingenuity in invention and by empirical processes have\nforestalled the West in arriving at so much useful agricultural and medical\nlore that they, rather than the nations of the West, might have been looked to\nas the forerunners and leaders in what is termed the scientific approach\ntowards the understanding and mastery of man’s natural environment. It is\nlittle short of amazing that a people who pioneered in the invention of paper,\nprinting, gunpowder, and the compass – to speak only of some of their best\nknown innovations – did not also take precedence in devising the power loom,\nthe steam engine, and the other revolutionary machines of the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries.\n\nThe purpose of printing among the Chinese was not the creation of uniform\nrepeatable products for a market and a price system. Print was an alternative\nto their prayer-wheels and was a visual means of multiplying incantatory\nspells, much like advertising in our age.\n\nBut we can learn much about print from the Chinese attitude towards it. For\nthe most obvious character of print is repetition, just as the obvious effect\nof repetition is hypnosis or obsession. Moreover, printing ideograms is\ntotally different from typography based on the phonetic alphabet. For the\nideograph even more than the hieroglyph is a complex _Gestalt_ involving all\nof the senses at once. The ideogram affords none of the separation and\nspecialization of sense, none of the breaking apart of sight and sound and\nmeaning which is the key to the phonetic alphabet. So that the numerous\nspecializations and separations of function inherent in industry and applied\nknowledge simply were not accessible to the Chinese. Today they appear to be\nproceeding along the lines of the phonetics alphabet. This ensures that they\nwill liquidate their present and traditional culture _in toto_. They will then\nproceed by the paths of schizophrenia and multiply dichotomies in the\ndirection of physical power and aggressive organization, on a centre-margin or\nRoman pattern.\n\nThe quite irrelevant ground that Carothers assigns to explaining the earlier\nChinese indifference to industrialism is that Chinese writing – or printing –\nrequires much erudition for its understanding. The same is true in varying\ndegrees of all non-alphabetic forms of writing. The comment of Latourette on\nthis point will help here as well as later:\n\nThe greater part of the voluminous literature in Chinese has been written in\nthe classical style … The Chinese classical language presents difficulties. It\nis highly artificial. It is often replete with allusions and quotations and to\nappreciate and even to understand much of it the reader has to bring to it a\nvast store of knowledge of existing literature … It is only by going through a\nprodigious amount of literature and especially by memorising quantities of it\nthat the scholar obtains a kind of sixth sense which enables him to divine\nwhich of several readings is correct. Even the perusal of the classical\nlanguage, therefore, requires long preparation. Composition is still more of a\ntask. Few Occidentals have achieved an acceptable style and many a modern\nChinese who is the finished product of the present-day curriculum is far from\nadept.\n\nThe concluding observation of Carothers is that genetic studies of human\ngroups offer no certainty and very small data, indeed, compared to cultural\nand environmental approaches. My suggestion is that cultural ecology has a\nreasonably stable base in the human sensorium, and that any extension of the\nsensorium by technological dilation has a quite appreciable effect in setting\nup new ratios or proportions among all the senses. Languages being that form\nof technology constituted by dilation or uttering (outering) of all of our\nsenses at once, are themselves immediately subject to the impact or intrusion\nof any mechanically extended sense. That is, writing affects speech directly,\nnot only its accidence and syntax but also its enunciation and social\nuses.[6](ch02a_fn06.html#ch02a_fn06fn6)\n\n### Why non-literate societies cannot see films\n\nor photos without much training.\n\nSince the present object is to elucidate the effective causality of phonetic\nwriting in setting up new kinds of perception, let us turn to a\npaper[7](ch02a_fn06.html#ch02a_fn06fn7) by Professor John Wilson of the\nAfrican Institute of London University. For literate societies it is not easy\nto grasp why non-literates cannot see in three dimensions or perspective. We\nassume that this is normal vision and that no training is needed to view\nphotos or films. Wilson’s experiences arose from trying to use film in\nteaching natives to read:\n\nThe next bit of evidence was very, very interesting. This man – the sanitary\ninspector – made a moving picture, in very slow time, very slow technique, of\nwhat would be required of the ordinary household in a primitive African\nvillage in getting rid of standing water – draining pools, picking up all\nempty tins and putting them away, and so forth. We showed this film to an\naudience and asked them what they had seen, and they said they had seen a\nchicken, a fowl, and we didn’t know that there was a fowl in it! So we very\ncarefully scanned the frames one by one for this fowl, and, sure enough, for\nabout a second, a fowl went over the corner of the frame. Someone had\nfrightened the fowl and it had taken flight, through the righthand, bottom\nsegment of the frame. This was all that had been seen. The other things he had\nhoped they would pick up from the film they had not picked up at all, and they\nhad picked up something which we didn’t know was in the film until we\ninspected it minutely. Why? We developed all sorts of theories. Perhaps it was\nthe sudden movement of the chicken. Everything else was done in slow technique\n– people going forward slowly picking up the tin, demonstrating and all the\nrest of it, and the bird was apparently the one bit of reality for them. For\nthem there was another theory that the fowl had religious significance, which\nwe rather dismissed.\n\n_Question_ : Could you describe in more detail the scene in the film?\n\n_Wilson_: Yes, there was very slow movement of a sanitary laborer coming along\nand seeing a tin with water in it, picking the tin up and very carefully\npouring the water out and then rubbing it into the ground so no mosquito could\nbreed and very carefully putting this tin in a basket on the back of a donkey.\nThis was to show how you disposed of rubbish. It was like the man in the park\nwith a spiked stick, picking up the bits of paper and putting them in the\nsack. All this was done very slowly to show how important it was to pick up\nthose things because of mosquitoes breeding in standing water. The cans were\nall very carefully taken away and disposed of in the ground and covered up so\nthere would be no more standing water. The film was about five minutes long.\nThe chicken appeared for a second in this kind of setting.\n\n_Question_ : Do you literally mean that when you talked with the audience you\ncame to believe that they had not _seen_ anything else but the chicken?\n\n_Wilson_ : We simply asked them: What did you see in this film?\n\n_Question_ : Not what did you _think_?\n\n_Wilson_ : No, what did you _see_?\n\n_Question_ : How many people were in the viewing audience of whom you asked\nthis question?\n\n_Wilson_ : 30-odd.\n\n_Question_ : No one gave you a response other than “We saw the chicken”?\n\n_Wilson_ : No, this was the first quick response – “We saw a chicken.”\n\n_Question_ : They did see a man, too?\n\n_Wilson_ : Well, when we questioned them further they had seen a man, but what\nwas really interesting was they hadn’t made a whole story out of it, and in\npoint of fact, we discovered afterwards that they hadn’t seen a whole frame –\nthey had inspected the frame for details. Then we found out from the artist\nand an eye specialist that a sophisticated audience, an audience that is\naccustomed to the film, focuses a little way in front of the flat screen so\nthat you take in the whole frame. In this sense, again, a picture is a\nconvention. You’ve got to look at the picture as a whole first, and these\npeople did not do that, not being accustomed to pictures. When presented with\nthe picture they began to inspect it, rather as the scanner of a television\ncamera, and go over it very rapidly. Apparently, that is what the eye\nunaccustomed to pictures does – scans the picture – and they hadn’t scanned\none picture before it moved on, _in spite_ of the slow technique of the film.\n\nThe key facts are at the end of the passage. Literacy gives people the power\nto focus a little way in front of an image so that we take in the whole image\nor picture at a glance. Non-literate people have no such acquired habit and do\nnot look at objects in our way. Rather they scan objects and images as we do\nthe printed page, segment by segment. Thus they have no detached point of\nview. They are wholly _with_ the object. They go empathically into it. The eye\nis used, not in perspective but tactually, as it were. Euclidean spaces\ndepending on much separation of sight from touch and sound are not known to\nthem.\n\nFurther difficulties which these natives had with film will help us to see how\nmany of the conventions of literacy are built into even non-verbal forms like\nfilm:\n\nMy point is that I think we’ve got to be very wary of pictures; they can be\ninterpreted in the light of your experience. Now, next we thought that if we\nare going to use these films we’ve got to have some sort of process of\neducation and we’ve got to have some research. We found also some fascinating\nthings in this research process. We found that the film is, as produced in the\nWest, a very highly conventionalized piece of symbolism although it looks very\nreal. For instance, we found that if you were telling a story about two men to\nan African audience and one had finished his business and he went off the edge\nof the screen, the audience wanted to know what had happened to him; they\ndidn’t accept that this was just the end of him and that he was of no more\ninterest in the story. They wanted to know what happened to this fellow, and\nwe had to write stories that way, putting in a lot of material that wasn’t to\nus necessary. We had to follow him along the street until he took a natural\nturn – he mustn’t walk off the side of the screen, but must walk down the\nstreet and make a natural turn. It was quite understandable that he could\ndisappear around the turn. The action had to follow a natural course of\nevents.\n\nPanning shots were very confusing because the audience didn’t realize what was\nhappening. They thought the items and details inside the picture were\nliterally moving. You see, the convention was not accepted. Nor was the idea\nof a person sitting still while the camera was brought in to a close-up; this\nwas a strange thing, this picture growing bigger in your presence. You know\nthe common way of starting a film: show the city, narrow it down to a street,\nnarrow it down to one house, take your camera in through the window, etc. This\nwas literally interpreted as _you_ walking forward and doing all those things\nuntil you were finally taken in through the window.\n\nAll of this meant that to use the film as a really effective medium we had to\nbegin a process of education in useful conventions and make those films which\nwould educate people to one convention, to the idea, for example, of a man\nwalking off the side of the screen. We had to show that there was a street\ncorner and have the man walk around the street corner and then in the next\npart of the film show him walking away, and then cut the scene.\n\n### African audiences cannot accept our passive consumer role in the presence\nof film.\n\nA basic aspect of any literate audience is its profound acceptance of a\npassive consumer role in the presence of book or film. But an African audience\nhad had no training in the private and silent following of a narrative\nprocess.\n\nThis is an important matter. An African audience does not sit silently without\nparticipating. They like to participate, so the person who shows the films and\nmakes the live commentary must be flexible, stimulating, and get responses. If\nthere is a situation where a character sings a song, the song is sung and the\naudience is invited to join in. This audience participation had to be thought\nof as the film was made and opportunities provided for it. Live commentators\nwho presented the films had to be trained to the last degree in what the film\nmeant and in their interpretation of the film for different audiences. They\nwere Africans taken out of the teaching profession and trained for this\nbusiness.\n\nBut even when trained to follow film the native of Ghana cannot accept a film\nabout Nigerians. He cannot generalize his experience from film to film, such\nis the depth of involvement in particular experiences. This empathic\ninvolvement, natural to the oral society and the audile-tactile man, is\ncracked by the phonetic alphabet which abstracts the visual component from the\nsensory complex. This leads to one further point of Wilson’s. He explained the\nrelevance of Chaplin technique in making films for native audiences. The story\nwas in the gestures, and the gestures were complex and precise. Wilson noted\nthe inability of Africans to follow complex narratives but also their subtlety\nin dramatization:\n\nOne thing we were ignorant of at this time, and something we ought to have\nknown a lot more about is that those African audiences are very good at role-\nplaying. Part of a child’s education in a pre-literate society is role-\nplaying; he’s got to learn to play the role of elders in certain given\nsituations. One thing fortunately we did discover was that the cartoon went\ndown very well. This puzzled us until we found out that puppetry is quite a\ncommon pastime.\n\nBut there is more to this point than Wilson supposes. Had TV been available he\nwould have been amazed to discover how much more readily the Africans took to\nit than they did to film. For with film you are the camera and the non-\nliterate man cannot use his eyes like a camera. But with TV you are the\nscreen. And TV is two-dimensional and sculptural in its tactile contours. TV\nis not a narrative medium, is not so much visual as audile-tactile. That is\nwhy it is empathic, and why the optimal mode of TV image is the cartoon. For\nthe cartoon appeals to natives as it does to our children, because it is a\nworld in which the visual component is so small that the viewer has as much to\ndo as in a crossword puzzle.[8](ch02a_fn07.html#ch02a_fn07fn8)\n\nMore important still, with the bounding line of a cartoon, as with a cave\npainting, we tend to be in an area of the interplay of the senses, and hence\nof strongly haptic or tactile character. That is to say, the art of the\ndraughtsman and the _celator_ alike is a strongly tactile and tangible art.\nAnd even Euclidean geometry is by modern standards very tactile.\n\nThis is a matter discussed by William Ivins, Jr., in _Art and Geometry: A\nStudy in Space Intuitions_. He explains the unverbalized assumptions of Greek\nspace awareness: “The Greeks never mentioned among the axioms and postulates\nof their geometry their basic assumption of congruence, and yet … it is among\nthe most fundamental things in Greek geometry, and plays a determining role in\nits form, its power, and its limitations.” (p. x) Congruence was a new and\nexciting visual dimension, unknown to audile-tactile cultures. As Ivins says\nin this regard, “Unlike the eye, the unaided hand is unable to discover\nwhether three or more objects are on a line.” ([p. 7](ch01.html#page_7)) It is\nvery obvious why Plato might have insisted that “no one destitute of geometry\nenter” his academy. A similar motive leads the Viennese musician Carl Orff to\nforbid children to study music in his school if they have already learned to\nread and write. The visual bias so attained he feels makes it quite hopeless\nto develop their audile-tactile powers in music. Ivins goes on to explain why\nwe have the illusion of space as a kind of independent container, whereas in\nfact space is “a quality or relationship of things and has no existence\nwithout them.” ([p. 8](ch01.html#page_8)) Yet in comparison with later\ncenturies, “the Greeks were tactile minded and … whenever they were given the\nchoice between a tactile or a visual way of thought they instinctively chose\nthe tactile one.” ([pp. 9](ch01.html#page_9)–10) Such remained the case until\nwell after Gutenberg in Western experience. Considering the history of Greek\ngeometry, Ivins observes: “… again and again during a period of six or seven\ncenturies they went right up to the door of modern geometry, but that,\ninhibited by their tactile-muscular, metrical ideas, they were never able to\nopen that door and pass out into the great open spaces of modern thought.”\n([p. 58](ch02.html#page_58))\n\n### When technology extends **ONE** of our senses, a new translation of\nculture occurs as swiftly as the new technology is interiorized.\n\nAlthough the main theme of this book is the Gutenberg Galaxy or a\nconfiguration of events, which lies far ahead of the world of alphabet and of\nscribal culture, it needs to be known why, without alphabet, there would have\nbeen no Gutenberg. And, therefore, we must get some insight into the\nconditions of culture and perception that make first, writing, and then,\nperhaps, alphabet possible at all.[9](ch02a_fn08.html#ch02a_fn08fn9)\n\nWilson’s account of the years of perceptual training needed to enable adult\nAfricans to be able to see movies has its exact analogue in the difficulties\nwhich Western adults have with “abstract” art. In 1925 Bertrand Russell wrote\nhis _ABC of Relativity_ , pointing out on the first page that:\n\nMany of the new ideas can be expressed in non-mathematical language, but they\nare none the less difficult on that account. What is demanded is a change in\nour imaginative picture of the world. … The same sort of change was demanded\nby Copernicus, when he taught that the earth is not stationary … To us now\nthere is no difficulty in this idea, because we learned it before our mental\nhabits had become fixed. Einstein’s ideas, similarly, will seem easier to\ngenerations which grow up with them; but for us a certain effort of\nimaginative reconstruction is unavoidable.\n\nIt is simpler to say that if a new technology extends one or more of our\nsenses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our\nsenses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens\nwhen a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any\nculture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly be opaque, and what\nhad been vague or opaque will become translucent. As Heinrich Wolfflin stated\nthe matter in 1915, in his revolutionary _Principles of Art History_ ([p.\n62](ch02.html#page_62)) “the effect is the thing that counts, not the sensuous\nfacts.” Wolfflin began working from the discoveries of the sculptor Adolf von\nHildebrand, whose _Problem of Form in the Figurative Arts_ had first clearly\nexplained the disorder in ordinary human sense perception, and the role of art\nin clarifying this confusion. Hildebrand had shown how tactility was a kind of\nsynesthesia or interplay among the senses, and as such, was the core of the\nrichest art _effects_. For the low definition imagery of the tactile mode\ncompels the viewer into an active participant role. When Africans watch movies\nas if they were low definition forms for active participation, we are amused\nby the incongruity. Working from effect rather than from cause, which we have\nalready seen as native to the Russian, was for us a novel mode of procedure in\nthe later nineteenth century, and will come in for fuller discussion later in\nthis book.\n\nA recent work by Georg von Bekesy, _Experiments in Hearing_ , offers an\nexactly reverse answer to the problem of space to the one which Carothers and\nWilson have just given us. Whereas they are trying to talk about the\nperception of non-literate people in terms of literate experience, Professor\nvon Bekesy chooses to begin his discussion of acoustical space on its own\nterms. As one proficient in auditory spaces, he is keenly aware of the\ndifficulty of talking about the space of hearing, for the acoustical is\nnecessarily a world in “depth.”[10](ch02a_fn09.html#ch02a_fn09fn10) It is of\nthe utmost interest that in trying to elucidate the nature of hearing and of\nacoustic space, Professor von Bekesy should deliberately avoid viewpoint and\nperspective in favour of mosaic field. And to this end he resorts to two-\ndimensional painting as a means of revealing the resonant depth of acoustic\nspace. Here are his own words ([p. 4](ch01.html#page_4)):\n\nIt is possible to distinguish two forms of approach to a problem. One, which\nmay be called the theoretical approach, is to formulate the problem in\nrelation to what is already known, to make additions or extensions on the\nbasis of accepted principles, and then to proceed to test these hypotheses\nexperimentally. Another, which may be called the mosaic approach, takes each\nproblem for itself with little reference to the field in which it lies, and\nseeks to discover relations and principles that hold within the circumscribed\narea.\n\nVon Bekesy then proceeds to introduce his two paintings:\n\nA close analogy to these two approaches may be found in the field of art. In\nthe period between the eleventh and seventeenth centuries the Arabs and the\nPersians developed a high mastery of the arts of description. … Later, during\nthe Renaissance, a new form of representation was developed in which the\nattempt was made to give unity and perspective to the picture and to represent\nthe atmosphere. …\n\nWhen in the field of science a great deal of progress has been made and most\nof the pertinent variables are known, a new problem may most readily be\nhandled by trying to fit it into the existing framework. When, however, the\nframework is uncertain and the number of variables is large the mosaic\napproach is much the easier.\n\nThe mosaic approach is not only “much the easier” in the study of the\nsimultaneous which is the auditory field; it is the only relevant approach.\nFor the “two-dimensional” mosaic or painting is the mode in which there is\nmuting of the visual as such, in order that there may be maximal interplay\namong all of the senses. Such was the painterly strategy “since Cézanne,” to\npaint as if you held, rather than as if you saw, objects.\n\n### A theory of cultural change is impossible without knowledge of the\nchanging sense ratios effected\n\nby various externalizations of our senses.\n\nIt is very much worth dwelling on this matter, since we shall see that from\nthe invention of the alphabet there has been a continuous drive in the Western\nworld toward the separation of the senses, of functions, of operations, of\nstates emotional and political, as well as of tasks – a fragmentation which\nterminated, thought Durkheim, in the _anomie_ of the nineteenth century. The\nparadox presented by Professor von Bekesy is that the two-dimensional mosaic\nis, in fact, a multidimensional world of interstructural resonance. It is the\nthree-dimensional world of pictorial space that is, indeed, an abstract\nillusion built on the intense separation of the visual from the other senses.\n\nThere is here no question of values or preferences. It is necessary, however,\nfor any other kind of understanding to know why “primitive” drawing is two-\ndimensional, whereas the drawing and painting of literate man tends towards\nperspective. Without this knowledge we cannot grasp why men ever ceased to be\n“primitive” or audile-tactile in their sense bias. Nor could we ever\nunderstand why men have “since Cézanne” abandoned the visual in favour of the\naudile-tactile modes of awareness and of organization of experience. This\nmatter clarified, we can much more easily approach the role of alphabet and of\nprinting in giving a dominant role to the visual sense in language and art and\nin the entire range of social and of political life. For until men have up-\ngraded the visual component communities know only a tribal structure. The\ndetribalizing of the individual has, in the past at least, depended on an\nintense visual life fostered by literacy, and by literacy of the alphabetic\nkind alone. For alphabetic writing is not only unique but late. There had been\nmuch writing before it. In fact, any people that ceases to be nomadic and\npursues sedentary modes of work is ready to invent writing. No merely nomadic\npeople ever had writing any more than they ever developed architecture or\n“enclosed space.” For writing is a visual enclosure of non-visual spaces and\nsenses. It is, therefore, an abstraction of the visual from the ordinary sense\ninterplay. And whereas speech is an outering (utterance) of all of our senses\nat once, writing abstracts from speech.\n\nAt the present time it is easier to grasp this specific technology of writing.\nThe new institutes for teaching speeded-up reading habits work on the\nseparation of eye-movements from inner verbalization. It will be indicated\nlater that all reading in the ancient and medieval worlds was reading aloud.\nWith print the eye speeded up and the voice quieted down. But inner\nverbalizing was taken for granted as inseparable from the horizontal following\nof the words on the page. Today we know that the divorce of reading and\nverbalizing can be made by vertical reading. This, of course, pushes the\nalphabetic technology of the separation of the senses to an extreme of\ninanity, but it is relevant to an understanding of how writing of any sort\ngets started.\n\nIn a paper entitled “A History of the Theory of Information,” read to the\nRoyal Society in 1951, E. Colin Cherry of the University of London, observed\nthat “Early invention was greatly hampered by an inability to dissociate\nmechanical structure from animal form. The invention of the wheel was one\noutstanding early effort of such dissociation. The great spurt in invention\nwhich began in the sixteenth century rested on the gradual dissociation of the\nmachine from animal form.” Printing was the first mechanization of an ancient\nhandicraft and led easily to the further mechanization of all handicrafts. The\nmodern phases of this process are the theme of _Mechanization Takes Command_\nby Siegfried Giedion.\n\nHowever, Giedion is concerned with a minute tracing of the stages by which in\nthe past century we have used mechanism to recover organic form:\n\nIn his celebrated studies of the ’seventies on the motions of men and animals,\nEdward Muybridge set up a series of thirty cameras at twelve-inch intervals,\nreleasing their shutters electromagnetically as soon as the moving object\npassed before the plate. … Each picture showed the object in an isolated phase\nas arrested by each camera. ([p. 107](ch02.html#page_107))\n\nThat is to say, the object is translated out of organic or simultaneous form\ninto a static or pictorial mode. By revolving a sequence of such static or\npictorial spaces at a sufficient speed, the illusion of organic wholeness, or\ninterplay of spaces, is created. Thus, the wheel finally becomes the means of\nmoving our culture away from the machine. But it was by means of electricity\napplied to the wheel that the wheel merges once more with animal form. In\nfact, the wheel is now an obsolete form in the electric-missile age. But\nhypertrophy is the mark of obsolescence, as we shall see again and again. Just\nbecause wheel is now returning to organic form in the twentieth century it is\nquite easy for us to understand how primitive man “invented” it. Any creature\nin motion is a wheel in that repetition of movement has a cyclic and circular\nprinciple in it. Thus the melodies of literate societies are repeatable\ncycles. But the music of non-literate people has no such repetitive cyclic and\nabstract form as melody. Invention, in a word, is translation of one kind of\nspace into another.\n\nGiedion devotes some time to the work of the French physiologist, Etienne\nJules Morey (1830–1904), who devised the myograph for recording the movements\nof muscles: “Morey quite consciously looks back to Descartes, but instead of\ngraphically representing sections he translates organic movement into graphic\nform.” ([p. 19](ch02.html#page_19))\n\n### The twentieth century encounter between alphabetic and electronic faces of\nculture confers on the printed word a crucial role in staying the return to\n**THE AFRICA WITHIN**.\n\nThe invention of the alphabet, like the invention of the wheel, was the\ntranslation or reduction of a complex, organic interplay of spaces into a\nsingle space. The phonetic alphabet reduced the use of all the senses at once,\nwhich is oral speech, to a merely visual code. Today, such translation can be\neffected back and forth through a variety of spatial forms which we call the\n“media of communication.” But each of these spaces has unique properties and\nimpinges upon our other senses or spaces in unique ways.\n\nToday, then, it is easy to understand the invention of the alphabet because,\nas A. N. Whitehead pointed out in _Science and the Modern World_ ([p.\n141](ch02a.html#page_141)) the great discovery of the nineteenth century was\nthe discovery of the method of discovery:\n\nThe greatest invention of the nineteenth century was the invention of the\nmethod of invention. A new method entered into life. In order to understand\nour epoch, we can neglect all the details of change, such as railways,\ntelegraphs, radios, spinning machines, synthetic dyes. We must concentrate on\nthe method in itself; that is the real novelty which has broken up the\nfoundations of the old civilization. … One element in the new method is just\nthe discovery of how to set about bridging the gap between the scientific\nideas, and the ultimate product. It is a process of disciplined attack upon\none difficulty after another.\n\nThe method of invention, as Edgar Poe demonstrated in his “Philosophy of\nComposition,” is simply to begin with the solution of the problem or with the\neffect intended. Then one backtracks, step by step, to the point from which\none must begin in order to reach the solution or effect. Such is the method of\nthe detective story, of the symbolist poem, and of modern science. It is,\nhowever, the twentieth century step beyond this method of invention which is\nneeded for understanding the origin and the action of such forms as the wheel\nor the alphabet. And that step is not the backtracking from _product_ to\nstarting point, but the following of _process_ in isolation from product. To\nfollow the contours of process as in psychoanalysis provides the only means of\navoiding the product of process, namely neurosis or psychosis.\n\nIt is the purpose of the present book to study primarily the print phase of\nalphabetic culture. The print phase, however, has encountered today the new\norganic and biological modes of the electronic world. That is, it is now\ninterpenetrated at its extreme development of mechanism by the electro-\nbiological, as de Chardin has explained. And it is this reversal of character\nwhich makes our age “connatural,” as it were, with non-literate cultures. We\nhave no more difficulty in understanding the native or non-literate\nexperience, simply because we have recreated it electronically within our own\nculture. (Yet post-literacy is a quite different mode of interdependence from\npre-literacy.) So my dwelling upon the earlier phases of alphabetic technology\nis not irrelevant to an understanding of the Gutenberg era.\n\nColin Cherry had this to say about early writing:\n\nA detailed history of spoken and written languages would be irrelevant to our\npresent subject, but nevertheless there are certain matters of interest which\nmay be taken as a starting-point. The early writings of Mediterranean\ncivilizations were in picture, or “logographic” script: simple pictures were\nused to represent objects and also, by association, ideas, actions, names, and\nso on. Also, what is much more important, phonetic writing was developed, in\nwhich sounds were given symbols. With the passage of time, the pictures were\nreduced to more formal symbols as determined by the difficulty of using a\nchisel, or a reed brush, while the phonetic writing simplified into a set of\ntwo or three dozen alphabetic letters, divided into consonants and vowels.\n\nIn Egyptian hieroglyphics we have a supreme example of what is now called\n_redundancy_ in languages and code; one of the difficulties in deciphering the\nRosetta stone lay in the fact that a polysyllabic word might give each\nsyllable not one symbol but a number of different ones in common use, in order\nthat the word should be thoroughly understood. (The effect when literally\ntranscribed into English is one of stuttering.) On the other hand the Semitic\nlanguages show an early recognition of redundancy. Ancient Hebrew script had\nno vowels: modern Hebrew has none, too, except in children’s books. Many other\nancient scripts have no vowels. Slavonic Russian went a step further in\ncondensation: in religious texts, commonly used words were abbreviated to a\nfew letters, in a manner similar to our present-day use of the ampersand,\nabbreviations such as lb and the increasing use of initials, e.g., U.S.A.,\nUnesco, O.K.\n\nIt is not the avoidance of redundancy that is the key to the phonetic alphabet\nand its effects on person and society. “Redundancy” is a “content” concept,\nitself a legacy of alphabetic technology. That is, any phonetic writing is a\nvisual code for speech. Speech is the “content” of phonetic writing. But it is\nnot the content of any other kind of writing. Pictographic and ideographic\nvarieties of writing are _Gestalts_ or snapshots of various situations,\npersonal or social. In fact, we can get a good idea of non-alphabetic forms of\nwriting from modern mathematical equations like _E = MC 2_ or from the ancient\nGreek and Roman “figures of rhetoric.” Such equations or figures have no\ncontent but are structures like an individual melody which evoke their own\nworld. The figures of rhetoric are postures of the mind, as hyperbole, or\nirony, or litotes, or simile, or paranomasia. Picture writing of all kinds is\na ballet of such postures which delights our modern bias towards synesthesia\nand audile-tactile richness of experience, far more than does the bare,\nabstract alphabetic form. It would be well today if children were taught a\ngood many Chinese ideograms and Egyptian hieroglyphs as a means of enhancing\ntheir appreciation of our alphabet.\n\nColin Cherry, then, misses the point about the unique character of our\nalphabet, namely that it dissociates or abstracts, not only sight and sound,\nbut separates all meaning from the sound of the letters, save so far as the\nmeaningless letters relate to the meaningless sounds. So long as any other\nmeaning is vested in sight or sound, the divorce between the visual and the\nother senses remains incomplete, as is the case in all forms of writing save\nthe phonetic alphabet.\n\n### Current concern with reading and spelling reform steers away from visual\nto auditory\n\nstress.\n\nIt is interesting that today there is a growing unrest about our alphabetic\ndissociation of the senses. On [page 57](ch02.html#page_57) there is a sample\nof a recent attempt at a new alphabet that would restore more phonic character\nto our script. The most notable thing about the sample is that it has the\nhighly textural and tactile quality of an ancient manuscript page. In our\ndesire to restore some unity of interplay among our senses we grope towards\nancient manuscript forms which must be read aloud to be read at all. Side by\nside with this extreme development is that of the new institutes for speeded-\nup reading. There they are taught how to use the eye on the page so as to\navoid all verbalization and all incipient movements of the throat which\naccompany our cinematic chase from left to right, in order to create the\nmental sound movie which we call reading.\n\nThe most definitive work we have on the phonetic letters is _The Alphabet_ by\nDavid Diringer. He begins his story as follows ([p. 37](ch02.html#page_37)):\n\nThe alphabet is the last, the most highly developed, the most convenient and\nthe most easily adaptable system of writing. Alphabetic writing is now\nuniversally employed by civilized peoples; its use is acquired in childhood\nwith ease. There is an enormous advantage, obviously, in the use of letters\nwhich represent single sounds rather than ideas or syllables; no sinologist\nknows all the 80,000 or so Chinese symbols, but it is also far from easy to\nmaster the 9,000 or so symbols actually employed by Chinese scholars. How far\nsimpler is it to use 22 or 24 or 26 signs only! The alphabet may also be\npassed from one language to another without great difficulty; the same\nalphabet is used now for English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Turkish,\nPolish, Dutch, Czech, Croatian, Welsh, Finnish, Hungarian and others, and has\nderived from the alphabet once used by the ancient Hebrews, Phoenicians,\nAramaeans, Greeks, Etruscans and Romans.\n\nThanks to the simplicity of the alphabet, writing has become very common; it\nis no longer a more or less exclusive domain of the priestly or other\nprivileged classes, as it was in Egypt, or Mesopotamia, or China. Education\nhas become largely a matter of reading and writing, and is possible for all.\nThe fact that alphabetic writing has survived with relatively little change\nfor three and a half millennia, notwithstanding the introduction of printing\nand the typewriter, and the extensive use of shorthand-writing, is the best\nevidence for its suitability to serve the needs of the whole modern world. It\nis this simplicity, adaptability and suitability which have secured the\ntriumph of the alphabet over the other systems of writing.\n\nAlphabetic writing and its origin constitute a story in themselves; they offer\na new field for research which American scholars are beginning to call\n“alphabetology.” No other system of writing has had so extensive, so intricate\nand so interesting a history.\n\nDiringer’s observation that the alphabet is “now universally employed by\ncivilized peoples” is a bit tautological since it is by alphabet alone that\nmen have detribalized or individualized themselves into “civilization.”\nCultures can rise far above civilization artistically but without the phonetic\nalphabet they remain tribal, as do the Chinese and the Japanese. It is\nnecessary to stress that my concern is with the process of separation of sense\nby which the detribalizing of men is achieved. Whether such personal\nabstraction and social detribalization be a “good thing” is not for any\nindividual to determine. But a recognition of the process may disembarrass the\nmatter of the miasmal moral fogs that now invest it.\n\n### The alphabet is an aggressive and militant absorber and transformer of\ncultures, as Harold Innis was the first to show.\n\nAnother observation of Diringer’s that deserves comment is the acceptability\namong all peoples of a technology that uses letters to “represent single\nsounds rather than ideas or syllables.” Another way of putting this is to say\nthat any society possessing the alphabet can translate any adjacent cultures\ninto its alphabetic mode. But this is a one-way process. No non-alphabetic\nculture can take over an alphabetic one; because the alphabet cannot be\nassimilated; it can only liquidate or reduce. However, in the electronic age\nwe may have discovered the limits of the alphabet technology. It need no\nlonger seem strange that peoples like the Greeks and Romans, who had\nexperienced the alphabet, should also have been driven in the direction of\nconquest and organization-at-a-distance. Harold Innis, in _Empire and\nCommunications_ , was the first to pursue this theme and to explain in detail\nthe simple truth of the Cadmus myth. The Greek King Cadmus, who introduced the\nphonetic alphabet to Greece, was said to have sown the dragon’s teeth and that\nthey sprang up armed men. (The dragon’s teeth may allude to the old\nhieroglyphic forms.) Innis also explained why print causes nationalism and not\ntribalism; and why print causes price systems and markets such as cannot exist\nwithout print. In short, Harold Innis was the first person to hit upon the\n_process_ of change as implicit in the _forms_ of media technology. The\npresent book is a footnote of explanation to his work.\n\nDiringer is emphatic about only one thing concerning the alphabet. No matter\nhow or when it was achieved:\n\nAt any rate, it must be said that the great achievement of the invention was\nnot the creation of the _signs_. It lies in the adoption of a purely\nalphabetic system, which, moreover, denoted each sound by one sign only. For\nthis achievement, simple as it now seems to us, the inventor, or the inventors\nare to be ranked among the greatest benefactors of mankind. No other people in\nthe world has been able to develop a true alphabetic writing. The more or less\ncivilized peoples of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete, Asia Minor, Indus Valley,\nChina, Central America, reached an advanced stage in the history of writing,\nbut could not get beyond the transitional stage. A few peoples (the ancient\nCypriotes, the Japanese and others), developed a syllabary. But only the Syro-\nPalestinian Semites produced a genius who created the alphabetic writing, from\nwhich have descended all past and present alphabets.\n\n![image](../images/f0057_01.jpg)\n\nFigure 1, from the _New York Times_ , July 20, 1961.\n\nEach important civilization modifies its script and time may make its relation\nto some of its near relatives quite unrecognizable. Thus, the Brahmi, the\ngreat mother-script of India, the Korean alphabet, the Mongolian scripts are\nderived from the same source as the Greek, the Latin, the Runic, the Hebrew,\nthe Arabic, the Russian alphabet, although it is practically impossible for a\nlayman to see a real resemblance between them. ([pp.\n216](ch02b.html#page_216)–17)\n\nBy the meaningless sign linked to the meaningless sound we have built the\nshape and meaning of Western man. Our next concern will be to trace somewhat\nsketchily the effects of the alphabet in manuscript culture in the ancient and\nmedieval world. After that, we shall look much more closely at the\ntransformation of alphabetic culture by the printing press.\n\n### The Homeric hero becomes a split-man as he assumes an individual ego.\n\nIn his _Art and Illusion_ , E. H. Gombrich writes ([p.\n116](ch02.html#page_116)):\n\nIf I had to reduce the last chapter to a brief formula it would be “making\ncomes before matching.” Before the artist ever wanted to match the sights of\nthe visible world he wanted to create things in their own right. … The very\nviolence with which Plato denounces this trickery reminds us of the momentous\nfact that at the time he wrote, mimesis was a recent invention. There are many\ncritics now who share his distaste, for one reason or another, but even they\nwould admit there are few more exciting spectacles in the whole history of art\nthan the great awakening of Greek sculpture and painting between the sixth\ncentury and the time of Plato’s youth toward the end of the fifth century B.C.\n\nEtienne Gilson makes much of the distinction between making and matching in\nhis _Painting and Reality._ And whereas till Giotto a painting was a thing,\nfrom Giotto till Cézanne painting became the representation of things. See his\nchapter VIII on “Imitation and Creation.”\n\nThere was, of course, the same development towards representation and direct\nlineal narrative in poetry and prose, as we shall see. What is essential for\nunderstanding this process, however, is that _mimesis_ in Plato’s (not\nAristotle’s) sense is the necessary effect of separating out the visual mode\nfrom the ordinary enmeshment with the audile-tactile interplay of senses. It\nis this process, brought about by the experience of phonetic literacy, that\nhoicks societies of the world of “sacred” or cosmic space and time into the\ndetribalized or “profane” space and time of civilized and pragmatic man. Such\nis the theme of _The Sacred and The Profane: The Nature of Religion_ by Mircea\nEliade.\n\nIn _The Greeks and the Irrational_ , E. R. Dodds discusses the emotional\ninstability and manias of the Homeric heroes: “And we may also ask ourselves\nwhy a people so civilised, clear-headed, and rational as the Ionians did not\neliminate from their national epics these links with Borneo and the primitive\npast, just as they eliminated the fear of the dead …” ([p.\n13](ch02.html#page_13)) But it is his next page that is especially helpful:\n\n“His own behaviour … has become alien to him. He cannot understand it. It is\nfor him no part of his Ego.” This is a perfectly true observation, and its\nrelevance to some of the phenomena we have been considering cannot, I think,\nbe doubted. Nilsson is also, I believe, right in holding that experiences of\nthis sort played a part – along with other elements, such as the Minoan\ntradition of protecting goddesses – in building up that machinery of\n_physical_ intervention to which Homer resorts so constantly and, to our\nthinking, often so superfluously. We find it superfluous because the divine\nmachinery seems to us in many cases to do no more than duplicate a natural\npsychological causation. But ought we not perhaps to say rather that the\ndivine machinery “duplicates” a psychic intervention – that is, presents it in\na concrete pictorial form? This was not superfluous; for only in this way\ncould it be made vivid to the imagination of the hearers. The Homeric poets\nwere without the refinements of language which would have been needed to “put\nacross” adequately a purely psychological miracle. What more natural than that\nthey should first supplement, and later replace, an old unexciting threadbare\nformula like _μ έυος ἒμβαλε θυμῷ_ by making the god appear as a physical\npresence and exhort his favourite with the spoken word? How much more vivid\nthan a mere inward monition is the famous scene in _Iliad_ I where Athena\nplucks Achilles by the hair and warns him not to strike Agamemnon! But she is\nvisible to Achilles alone: “none of the others saw her.” That is a plain hint\nthat she is projection, the pictorial expression, of an inward monition – a\nmonition which Achilles might have described by such a vague phrase as _εν\nέπνευσε φρεσί δαίμων._ And I suggest that in general the inward monition, or\nthe sudden unaccountable feeling of power, or the sudden unaccountable loss of\njudgement, is the germ out of which the divine machinery developed.\n\nThe hero has become a split man as he moves towards the possession of an\nindividual ego. And the “split” is manifest as pictorialized models or\n“machinery” of complex situations such as tribal, auditory man had made no\neffort to visualize. That is to say, detribalization, individualization, and\npictorialization are all one. The magical mode disappears in proportion as\ninterior events are made visually manifest. But such manifestation is also\nreduction and distortion of complex relations which are more fully sensed when\nthere is full interplay of all the senses at once.\n\nMimesis to Plato had appeared, quite understandably, as varieties of\nrepresentation, especially visual. In his _Poetics_ 4, Aristotle made mimesis\ncentral to his entire cognitive and epistemological world, not limiting it to\nany one sense. But the first onset of literacy, and, therefore, of visuality\nas abstracted from the other senses, seemed to Plato a diminution of onto-\nlogical awareness, or an impoverishment of Being. Bergson somewhere asks, how\nshould we be able to know if some agent could double the speed of _all_ events\nin the world? Quite simply, he answered. We would discern a great loss of\nrichness in experience. Such seems to have been Plato’s attitude towards\nliteracy and visual mimesis.\n\nGombrich begins his tenth chapter of _Art and Illusion_ with further\nobservations on visual mimesis:\n\nThe last chapter has led this inquiry back to the old truth that the discovery\nof appearances was not due so much to a careful observation of nature as to\nthe invention of pictorial effects. I believe indeed that the ancient writers\nwho were still filled with a sense of wonder at man’s capacity to fool the eye\ncame closer to an understanding of this achievement than many later critics …\nbut if we discard Berkeley’s theory of vision, according to which we “see” a\nflat field but “construct” a tactile space, we can perhaps rid art history of\nits obsession with space and bring other achievements into focus, the\nsuggestion of light and of texture, for instance, or the mastery of\nphysiognomic expression.\n\nBerkeley’s _New Theory of Vision_ (1709) is now favoured by psychologists of\nour sense lives. But Berkeley was concerned to refute Descartes and Newton,\nwho had wholly abstracted the visual sense from the interaction of the other\nsenses. On the other hand, the suppression of the visual sense in favour of\nthe audile-tactile complex, produces the distortions of tribal society, and of\nthe configuration of jazz and primitive art imitations which broke upon us\nwith radio, but not just “because” of\nradio.[11](ch02a_fn10.html#ch02a_fn10fn11)\n\nGombrich not only has all the most relevant information about the rise of the\npictorial mode; he has all the right difficulties. He ends his _Art and\nIllusion_ by commenting ([pp. 117](ch02.html#page_117)–18):\n\nThere is finally the history of Greek painting as we can follow it in painted\npottery, which tells of the discovery of foreshortening and the conquest of\nspace early in the fifth century and of light in the fourth. … Emanuel Loewy\nat the turn of the century first developed his theories about the rendering of\nnature in Greek art that stressed the priority of conceptual modes and their\ngradual adjustment to natural appearances. … But in itself it explains very\nlittle. For why was it that this process started comparatively so late in the\nhistory of mankind? In this respect our perspective has very much changed. To\nthe Greeks the archaic period represented the dawn of history, and classical\nscholarship has not always shaken off this inheritance. From this point of\nview it appeared quite natural that the awakening of art from primitive modes\nshould have coincided with the rise of all those other activities, that, for\nthe humanist, belong to civilization: the development of philosophy, of\nscience, and of dramatic poetry.\n\n### The world of the Greeks illustrates why visual appearances cannot interest\na people before the interiorization of alphabetic technology.\n\nThe discovery that the representation of “natural appearances” is quite\nabnormal and also quite unperceptible as such to non-literate peoples, has\ncreated some disturbance of mind nowadays. For the same distortions of reality\nthat we associate with our conventions of abstractly visual perception also\ninvaded mathematics, science and the verbal arts of logic and poetry. In the\npast century of non-Euclidean geometries, symbolic logics, and symbolist\npoetry, the same discovery has been repeated. That is to say, single-plane\nlineal, visual, and sequential codification of experience is quite\nconventional and limited. It is in danger of being brushed aside today in\nevery area of Western experience. We have long been accustomed to praising the\nGreeks for the invention of visual order in sculpture, painting, science, as\nwell as in philosophy, literature, and politics. But today, having learned how\nto play with each of the senses in isolation, scholars look askance at the\nGreeks for their pusillanimity: “Whatever else the story, as I have pieced it\ntogether, may tell, it brings out the fact that Greek art and Greek geometry\nwere based on the same tactile-muscular sensuous intuitions, that in many ways\ntheir developments went along similar lines, and that their limitations were\nimplicit in those intuitions.”[12](ch02a_fn11.html#ch02a_fn11fn12)\n\nFrom the point of view of recent intense awareness of the visual components of\nexperience, then, the Greek world looks timid and tentative. But there was\nnothing in the manuscript phase of alphabetic technology that was intense\nenough to split the visual from the tactile entirely. Not even Roman script\nhad the power to do that. It was not until the experience of mass production\nof exactly uniform and repeatable type, that the fission of the senses\noccurred, and the visual dimension broke away from the other senses.\n\nOswald Spengler noted in _The Decline of the West_ ([p.\n89](ch02.html#page_89)) the liquidation of the visual, Western awareness in\nour new physics, greeting the return to the unseen with a tribal cheer:\n\nOnce the space-element or point had lost its last persistent relic of\nvisualness and, instead of being represented to the eye as a cut in co-\nordinate lines, was defined as a group of three independent numbers, there was\nno longer any inherent objection to replacing the number _3_ by the general\nnumber _n_. The notion of dimension was radically changed. It was no longer a\nmatter of treating the properties of a point metrically with reference to its\nposition in a visible system, but of representing the entirely abstract\nproperties of a number-group …\n\n“Entirely abstract” means the non-visual resonating interplay of the audile-\ntactile by which electricity and radio especially were to regenerate what\nConrad called “the Africa within” the Western experience.\n\nIt would seem that the extension of one or another of our senses by mechanical\nmeans, such as the phonetic script, can act as a sort of twist for the\nkaleidoscope of the entire sensorium. A new combination or ratio of the\nexisting components occurs, and a new mosaic of possible forms presents\nitself. That such switch of sense ratios should occur with every instance of\nexternal technology is easy to see today. Why has it been unnoticed before?\nPerhaps because the shifts have in the past occurred somewhat gradually. Now\nwe experience such a series of new technologies even in our own world and,\nbesides, have means of observing so many other cultures that only great\ninattention could now conceal the role of new media of information in altering\nthe posture and relations of our senses.\n\nMerely for the purpose of finding our bearings it may be helpful to compare\nand contrast a few instances of literature and art in the newly literate Greek\nworld, on one hand, and the non-literate world, on the other.\n\nIt is significant, however, that the Romans did go beyond the Greeks in the\nawareness of visual properties:\n\nLucretius is neither speaking of, nor interested in, the problems of\nrepresentation. His description of the purely optical phenomena does, however,\ngo considerably beyond the cautious observations of Euclid. It is a complete\ndescription, not of the expanding visual cone, but of the apparent cone of\ncontraction, or diminution, which is its counterpart. The ideas which\nLucretius expresses a quarter of a century before the writing of “De\nArchitectura” are the optical equivalent of the perspective system which\nVitruvius describes.[13](ch02a_fn12.html#ch02a_fn12fn13)\n\nLikewise, the Romans exceeded the Greeks in their bias towards the life of\naction, of applied knowledge, and the lineal organization of many levels of\nliving. In art this bias appears in the setting of flat planes, one behind the\nother, in order that action may appear by an oblique or diagonal shift in the\nplanes. But there is one observation of John White’s (_The Birth and Rebirth\nof Pictorial Space_ , [p. 237](ch02b.html#page_237)) which is especially\nvaluable in illuminating the most striking feature of Greek narrative: “All\nthe forms lie in a single plane. All the movement is in one direction.” In a\nwork devoted entirely to the victory of the visual over the other senses,\nWhite examines spatial design in antiquity and later. “The simple spatial\npatterns which appear for the first time upon the delicate, curved surfaces of\nantique vases seem to echo no elaborate theoretical construction. In\nthemselves they call for no inquiry as to the nature of perspective systems\nwhich, if they existed, find no echo in surviving work.” ([p.\n270](ch02b.html#page_270))\n\n### The Greek **POINT OF VIEW** in both art and chronology has little in\ncommon with ours but was much like that of the Middle Ages.\n\nWhite’s view is that although some attributes of perspective occur in\nantiquity, there was not much interest in them as such. In the Renaissance it\nbecame recognized technique that perspective called for a _fixed_ point of\nview. Such a stress on private stance, while common to a print culture, simply\ndid not concern a manuscript culture. The dynamics of individualism and\nnationalism were merely latent in the scribal mode. For in the highly tactile\nproduct of the scribe the reader found no means for splitting off the visual\nfrom the audile-tactile complex, such as the sixteenth and seventeenth century\nreader did. A great deal of what is said by Bernard van Groningen in his study\nof the Greek time sense, _In the Grip of the Past_ , is useful in\nunderstanding the effects of visual bias as they concern the time sense. As\nmight be expected, the new Greek sense of chronological order and a one-way\nmovement of events was an overlay on the older mythical and cosmic idea of\nsimultaneous time, which is common to all non-literate communities. Van\nGroningen observes ([p. 17](ch02.html#page_17)): “The Greeks often refer to\nthe past and by doing so, they bind the matter in question to a chronological\nconception. But as soon as we inquire after the real meaning, it becomes\nobvious that the idea is not temporal but is used in general sense.”\n\nThis is, in respect to time, like having foreshortening without a fixed point\nof view or vanishing point. And that, indeed, was the Greek stage of visual\nabstraction. Somewhat in the same way, van Groningen argues, Herodotus having\n“freed himself from myth and mythical speculations,” made a gesture “to use\nthe past as an explanation of the present, or at any rate, of a later phase in\nthe development.” ([p. 26](ch02.html#page_26)) This visualizing of\nchronological sequences is unknown to oral societies, as it is now irrelevant\nin the electric age of information movement. The “narrative line” in a\nliterature is immediately revealing in the same way as the painterly or\nsculptural line. It tells exactly how far the dissociation of the visual from\nthe other senses has proceeded. Erich\nAuerbach[14](ch02a_fn13.html#ch02a_fn13fn14) confirms in literature all\naspects of the Greek development as it has appeared thus far in the other\narts. Thus Homer’s Achilles and Odysseus are presented in flat vertical planes\nby “fully externalized description, uniform illumination, uninterrupted\nconnection, free expression, all events in the foreground, displaying\nunmistakable meanings, few elements of historical development and of\npsychological perspective…”\n\nThe visual makes for the explicit, the uniform, and the sequential in\npainting, in poetry, in logic, history. The non-literate modes are implicit,\nsimultaneous, and discontinuous, whether in the primitive past or the\nelectronic present, which Joyce called “eins within a space.”\n\nVan Groningen relates the new visual and sequential idea of chronology with\n“the awakening of the scientific sense in Greece,” which, it is true, tries to\nobserve the facts with accuracy, but wishes even more to know the explanation\nand looks for it in preceding causes. This visual notion of “causality” found\nits extreme expression in Newtonian physics. Sir Edmund Whittaker writes in\n_Space and Spirit_ ([p. 86](ch02.html#page_86)):\n\nNewtonianism, like Aristotelianism, attempts to understand the world by\ntracing the connection of events with one another; and this is effected by\nordering our experiences according to the category of cause and effect,\ndiscovering for every phenomenon its determining agents or antecedents. The\naffirmation that this connection is all-embracing, that no event happens\nwithout a cause, is the _postulate_ of _causality_.\n\nThe extreme visual bias of this notion of cause obtrudes very incongruously in\nan electric and simultaneous world. Sir Edmund adds ([p.\n87](ch02.html#page_87)), by way of contrast:\n\nThus, the notion of force tended to become replaced by the notions of\n_interaction_ and of the _energy_ possessed by the aggregate of a set of\nparticles; and instead of considering single bodies under the influence of\nforces, the mathematical physicists developed theories such as that of\nLagrange in dynamics, in which mathematical equations are obtained capable of\npredicting the future of a whole system of bodies simultaneously, without\nbringing in the ideas of “force” or “cause” at all. …\n\nThe pre-Socratic or pre-literate philosophers like the post-literate\nscientists of our day have only to listen to the inner resonance of a problem\nin order to derive it and the universe from water or fire or some single\n“world-function.” That is, the speculators of our time can as easily fall\nunawares into the auditory bias of “field” theory as the Greeks leapt into the\nflatland of abstract visuality and one-way lineality. The Greeks, says van\nGroningen ([pp. 36](ch02.html#page_36)–7), eagerly sought the past:\n\nOdysseus is nowhere the adventurer who, drawn by the unknown, likes to go\nfarther and farther, who is charmed by the coming events, and urged on by the\nmysteries of the future to ever receding regions. Quite the contrary. He only\nwants to go back; the past fascinates him; he wants restoration of the things\nof the past, he travels by compulsion, driven along by Poseidon’s wrath,\nPoseidon the god of the strange and unknown land which attracts the\nadventurers but terrifies Odysseus. This endless wandering to him means\nadversity and misfortune; the return, happiness and peace. The mysterious\nfuture strikes agony into his heart; he has to steel himself against it; but\nhe feels safe with the past, with the known.\n\nThe idea of the past, discovered by means of the new visual chronology as an\narea of peace in a distant perspective was, indeed, a novelty. It would have\nbeen impossible save by phonetic literacy, and it is a vision which is quite\ndifficult for us to imagine today as ever being accessible again. Van\nGroningen’s analysis of the reasons for the Greek obsession with the past, as\nscientific and as psychological security, helps to explain the natural\nliterary bias of all humanist ages in favour of ruins. For nowhere does the\npast speak so eloquently to the solitary musings of the scholar as from the\nmidst of ruins. There is another feature of the time which bridges from the\nGreek present into the past: “The time discussed is clearly homogeneous. It\nbears the character of an uninterrupted sequence of occurrences in which\neverything is in its right place.” ([p. 95](ch02.html#page_95))\n\n### The Greeks invented both their artistic and scientific novelties after the\ninteriorization of the alphabet.\n\nHomogeneity, uniformity, repeatability, these are basic component notes of a\nvisual world newly emergent from an audile-tactile matrix. Such components the\nGreeks used as a bridge from present to past, but not from present to future.\nVan Groningen writes ([p. 95](ch02.html#page_95)): “The Greek knows and the\noriental knows not, how uncertain the future is; an undisturbed past and a\nprosperous present are in no way a guarantee of a happy future. So we can only\nvalue a human life … when it has become a complete past, at man’s death, as\nwith Tellus the Athenian.”\n\nThe analysis of William Ivins strongly supports van Groningen when the latter\nwrites: “The conception which they have of the future is, of course, only an\nexpected, dreaded or desired parallel to the past.” But the visual element in\nthe Greek sensibility was still much embedded in the audile-tactile complex,\ngiving to their fifth century, as to the Elizabethan Age, the character of a\nrelatively balanced sensibility.[15](ch02a_fn14.html#ch02a_fn14fn15) That the\nsame limitation of mere visual parallelism affected Greek geometry Ivins\npoints out in his _Art and Geometry_ ([pp. 57](ch02.html#page_57)–8):\n\nWhen Pappus had finished, the situation was that the late Greek geometers knew\ntwo focal ratios, three directrix-focus ratios, and the visual transformation\nof a circle into an ellipse. They also knew, and these I shall come back to,\nnot only particular cases of the invariance of anharmonic ratios but Euclid’s\n“porism,” the latter of which was as close a miss as possible for Desargues’\nTheorem. But they regarded these things as isolated propositions having no\nrelation to each other. Had the late Greeks only added to them the one further\nidea that parallel lines meet at infinity, they would have had in their hands\nat least logical equivalents of the basic ideas for geometrical continuity and\nfor perspective and perspective geometry. That is to say that again and again\nduring a period of six or seven centuries they went right up to the door of\nmodern geometry, but that, inhibited by their tactile-muscular, metrical\nideas, they were never able to open that door and pass out into the great open\nspaces of modern thought.\n\nThe story of uniformity, continuity, and homogeneity was the new mode in Greek\nlogic as it was in geometry. Jan Lukasiewicz, in _Aristotle’s Syllogistic_\nstresses: “Syllogistic as conceived by Aristotle requires terms to be\nhomogeneous with respect to their possible positions as subjects and\npredicates. This seems to be the true reason why singular terms were omitted\nby Aristotle.” ([p. 7](ch01.html#page_7)) And: “This is the greatest defect of\nthe Aristotelian logic, that singular terms and propositions have no place in\nit. What was the cause?” ([p. 6](ch01.html#page_6)) The cause was the same as\nin all the Greek seeking of the novelties of visual order and lineal\nhomogeneity. But our analyst has a further note ([p. 15](ch02.html#page_15))\non the inseparable nature of “logic” and the abstract visual faculty: “Modern\nformal logic strives to attain the greatest possible exactness. This aim can\nbe reached only by means of a precise language built up of stable, visually\nperceptible signs. Such a language is indispensable for any science.” But such\na language is made by excluding all but the visual sense even of words.\n\nThe only concern here is to spot the degree of effect which the alphabet had\non its first users. Lineality and homogeneity of parts were “discoveries,” or\nrather changes in the sense life of the Greeks under the new regime of\nphonetic writing. The Greeks expressed these new modes of visual perception in\nthe arts. The Romans extended lineality and homogeneity into the civic and\nmilitary spheres, and into the world of the arch and of enclosed or visual\nspace. They did not so much extend the Greek “discoveries” as undergo the same\nprocess of detribalization and visualization. They extended lineality into an\nEmpire and homogenization into the mass-processing of citizens, statuary, and\nbooks. Today the Roman would be quite at home in the U.S.A. and the Greek by\ncomparison would prefer the “backward” and oral cultures of our world, such as\nIreland or the Old South.\n\nThe kind and degree of literate experience of the Greek was not intense enough\nto enable him to translate his audile-tactile heritage into the “enclosed” or\n“pictorial” space that was only widely available to human sensibility after\nprinting. Between the extreme visuality of perspective and the flat planes of\nGreek and medieval art there is a further degree of abstraction or\ndissociation of our sense lives which we quite naturally feel to be the\ndifference between the ancient-medieval and the modern worlds. Since new,\nempathic methods of art and cultural analysis give us easy access to all\nmodalities of human sensibility we are no longer limited to a perspective of\npast societies. We recreate them.\n\nThere is entire consistency in the effects of the emergent visual component in\nevery sector of the ancient world. The steady increase of stress on retinal\nimpression from the Greek into the Roman time has been noted by John Hollander\nin _The Untuning of the Sky_ ([p. 7](ch01.html#page_7)):\n\nBut with the exception of oral, pre-literary poetry, added complications to\nthe consideration of poetry as sound arise in the existence and use of written\nlanguages. If a poem is to be treated as a highly complex utterance in a\nspoken language, its written form becomes a simple coding of it, word by word,\nonto a page. The poem will thus be defined in terms of patterns of sound\nclasses. But starting as early as the first Latin use of Greek meters,\nliterary analysis has been confronted with poems whose written versions, or\ncodings, contain significant individual and conventional elements which do not\nappear in the original, or aural, versions, and vice versa. To state that both\nmusic and poetry are composed of sound, without specifying the degree to which\nthis is true, therefore, becomes misleadingly inadequate. The difficulties of\nsuch a reduction have resulted not only in categorical esthetic confusions,\nbut in those which produced the unnecessary conflicts among traditional\nEuropean prosodic theories since Hellenistic times. The _locus classicus_ of\nthese confusions for our literary history occurred in the equation of what was\nactually a musical system (Greek meter) to a more graphic prosodic one (Latin\nquantitative scansion). It seems to be generally true that borrowed foreign\nliterary conventions, as well as revivals and adaptations of past traditions,\ninvade the linguistic structure of poetry at the written level. Any thorough\nformalistic analysis of the structure of poetry, and of its relation to the\nlanguage in which it is written, must deal with the written language as a\nsystem in itself, as well as with the spoken one.\n\nAlbert Einstein, in his _Short History of Music_ ([p. 20](ch02.html#page_20)),\noffers a further vista of these changes towards the visual organization of\nmusical structures in the Middle Ages:\n\nThe music being purely vocal, the notation dispensed with indications of\nrhythm; but it possessed an immediate intelligibility that was lacking in the\nGreek system, since it actually gave a visual representation of the rise and\nfall of melody. It became the sure foundation on which modern notation was to\nbe built; …\n\nEinstein extends his vista into the Gutenberg area itself ([p.\n45](ch02.html#page_45)):\n\nThis international influence was made possible by the invention of music-\nprinting about 1500. This produced as great a revolution in the history of\nmusic as book-printing had done in the history of general European culture. A\nquarter of a century after Gutenberg’s first attempts, German and Italian\nprinters produced printed missals. The decisive step – the printing of the\nnotation of measured music from type – was taken by Ottaviano dei Petrucci of\nFossombrone … at Venice. … Venice … remained the principal centre for the\nprinting and publishing of polyphonic music.\n\n### The continuity of Greek and medieval art was assured by the bond between\n**CAELATURA** or engraving and illumination.\n\nIn his _Approach to Greek Art_ ([p. 43](ch02.html#page_43)) Charles Seltman\nwrites:\n\nThe Greeks had no paper: papyrus was expensive, reserved for documents and\nunsuitable for drawing. Wax tablets had no permanence. In fact, the surface of\nthe vase was the drawing-paper of the artist. … It is significant that from\n650 B.C. onwards Athenian potters had already established a big export trade\nand were sending their products overseas to Aegina, Italy, and the East.\n\nSeltman in this passage indicates why the Greeks made so much less of literacy\nthan the Romans with their high organization of paper in production and the\nbook trade. The decline of the papyrus supplies in the later Roman Empire is a\nregularly assigned cause for the “collapse” of that Empire and its road\nsystem. For the Roman road was a paper route in every\nsense.[16](ch02a_fn15.html#ch02a_fn15fn16)\n\nThe principal theme of Seltman’s _Approach to Greek Art_ is that the major\nmode of Greek expression was not that of the sculptor but the _celator_ or\nengraver ([p. 12](ch01.html#page_12)):\n\nFor more than four centuries men have been instructed that the very best\nthings which the Greeks ever made were of marble, and that is why you may read\nin a book on Greek art written little more than a score of years ago that\n“sculpture was in many ways the most characteristic art of Greece; … it\nachieved the highest attainments.” Such has been the usual approach to Greek\nart. The prize must go to sculpture in stone, with which large works cast in\nbronze were often associated; next came painting, which is now represented\nmainly by drawings made on the surfaces of ancient vases; third came the so-\ncalled “minor arts,” under which label were grouped with condescension and\nconvenience the work of die-cutters, gem-engravers, jewellers, and celators\n(or metal-chasers). But does such “classing” in any way correspond with the\nideas which the Greeks themselves held about artists and art?\n\nIt is certain that they had very different views.\n\nEven in the distant age of bronze the inhabitants of Greece and the islands\nheld the skilled worker in metal in very high regard. His art was both a\nmystery and a delight, and he was thought to owe his gifts to supernatural\nbeings around whom many legends grew. There were creatures called Dactyls,\nsmelters of bronze; Curetes and Corybantes, armourers; Cabeiroi, who were\nskilful smiths; Telchines, gifted workers in gold, silver and bronze who made\nweapons for gods and the earliest statues; and lastly the mighty Cyclopes\nforging the bolts of Zeus. All these are vague giants, goblins and godlings –\npatron saints of the workshop and the forge whom you might do well to appease\nand some of whose names just meant “Fingers,” “Hammer,” “Tongs,” and “Anvil.”\nThen, by the time that the Homeric epic began to take form, one of these\nbeings seems to have grown in stature until he attained Olympian rank.\n\nEmbossing, and chasing, and engraving “on gold, silver, bronze, ivory or gems”\nwas the art called in Latin _caelatura_. It is significant that in our time we\nshould find it natural to observe many ancient productions in Seltman’s way:\n\nExciting as are the marbles of the Parthenon and certain sensitive tombstones\nof Attic work, it is not among such things that the finest art of the fifth\ncentury is to be sought. The most admired artists among the Greeks themselves\nwere not the masons, nor even the modellers, casters and finishers of fine\nbronzes – but the celators. ([p. 72](ch02.html#page_72))\n\nThe work of the _celator_ and engraver is much more tactile than visual and\ncorresponds to the new bias of our electric age. But as regards the present\nbook, the argument of Seltman is most relevant, for he traces the art of the\n_celator_ all the way through Greek and Roman times and through the medieval\nworld in the art of illumination ([p. 115](ch02.html#page_115)):\n\nPainting in this same age was also able to display its excellence especially\nin the making of miniatures upon glass set against a gold-leaf background. A\ncertain Greek named Bounneris signed one of these (Plate 102a) with portraits\nof a mother and two children, and another similar work, unsigned (Plate 102g),\nshows an agreeable male likeness. This is a fine aristocratic art which was to\ngive rise later to the art of illumination on vellum; and it is an art\ncontemporary with the philosopher Plotinus, a man more sensitive to fine art\nthan ever Plato or Aristotle had been.\n\n### The increase of visual stress among the Greeks alienated them from the\nprimitive art that the electronic age now reinvents after interiorizing the\n**UNIFIED FIELD** of electric all-at-onceness.\n\nThe prevalence of the art of the _celator_ , in a word, is a cue and a key to\nthe tactile mode of sensibility as it is interwoven with an incipient stage of\nliteracy, whether in Greece, Rome, or in the flat illumination of the Middle\nAges.\n\nSeltman, like most of his contemporaries, approaches Greek art, not in a\nperspective, but as a configuration or a mosaic of items in a field. Co-\nexistence and interplay among the figures in the flat field create a multi-\nlevelled and multi-sensuous awareness. This mode of approach tends to partake\nof the character of auditory, inclusive, and unenclosed space, as Georg von\nBekesy has shown in his _Experiments in Hearing_. But it was the method used\neverywhere, even by Percy Wyndham Lewis, the critical analyst of the return of\nauditory space to the twentieth century, in his _Time and Western Man_. And\nso, Seltman pursues an acoustic field approach, even to the story of the\norigins of perspective ([p. 31](ch02.html#page_31)):\n\n… Homer cannot be described as more childish than Aeschylus, but as a\ndifferent kind of poet; Plato is not called a riper stylist than Thucydides,\nbut a different kind of writer with a different theme; St. Paul’s letters are\nnot more decadent than Cicero’s, merely different. For the literature of the\nancient world this Growth and Decay Formula will not work. Are we justified in\napplying it to Fine Art?\n\n“Well,” you may say, “why worry if people have this harmless illusion about\nGrowth and Decay?” But it happens not to be so harmless, because it implies\nanother doctrine. Implicit in the formula is the dogma that earlier Greek\nartists must have been striving all the while to attain a naturalism, to\nachieve a life-like imitation that was beyond their powers. Yet, reverting to\nliterary comparison, it is not generally claimed that in dramatic\npresentation, Aeschylus, to take an example, was struggling to be as true to\nlife as Menander; or Shakespeare as true to life as Shaw. It is even\nconceivable – rather probable – that Aeschylus would have disapproved of the\nNew Comedy, and Shakespeare of Shaw.\n\nSeltman keeps the whole range of Greek interests in simultaneous play, as it\nwere, waiting for the intrusion of a new theme or pressure in the complex\nconfiguration. He watches the reduction of the resonant poetic modes to the\nsimple visual lines of prose, and cites the Parthenon sculptures as “the most\nperfect art-prose work of the Greeks.” These representational forms of\nsculpture he notes ([p. 66](ch02.html#page_66)) as prose because of their\n“descriptive realism”:\n\nThe fact, however, remains that prose literature and art-prose began to appear\namong the Greeks at about the same time, and that before the fifth century was\nout each had produced its masterpiece; the history of Thucydides, and the\nsculptures of the Parthenon.\n\nWhat cause or causes led to the adoption of descriptive realism in art to the\nnear exclusion of poetic formalism? It is of no use to talk of development or\ngrowth, for the Parthenon no more grew out of Olympia than the history of\nThucydides out of the dramas of Aeschylus. Rather, it seems that the fifth-\ncentury Greeks, having experimented in realistic art, began to find it more to\ntheir taste than formal art because they acquired a liking for verisimilitude.\n\n### A nomadic society cannot experience\n\nenclosed space.\n\nInstead of using Seltman’s unique observations about Greek celature as a take-\noff strip for the medieval manuscript culture, I am going to enlarge the\npresent mosaic of exhibits a little more. Before approaching the five\ncenturies of the Gutenberg galaxy, it will be well to note how profoundly\nindifferent are non-literate men to visual values in the organization of\nperception and experience. This indifference is shared by the artist “since\nCézanne.” A great art historian like Siegfried Giedion has extrapolated the\nnew art approaches to space “since Cézanne” to include “popular culture” and\n“anonymous history.” Art is for him as inclusive an idea as “mimesis” is for\nAristotle. He is currently completing a massive work on _The Beginnings of\nArt_ as a companion to his artistic analysis of all the abstract modes of\ntwentieth-century mechanization. It is necessary to understand the close\ninterrelation between the world and art of the cave man, and the intensely\norganic interdependence of men in the electric age. Of course, it could be\nargued that a lyric disposition to applaud the audile-tactile gropings of\nchild and cave art betokens a naive and uncritical obsession with the\nunconscious modes of an electric or simultaneous culture. But it was a great\nthrill for many late Romantics to break through suddenly into an\n“understanding” of primitive art. As Emile Durkheim had insisted, men could\nnot take much more of the fragmentation of work and experience by visual\nspecialization. For the real “abstract” art is that of realism and naturalism\nbased on a separation of the visual faculty from the interplay of the other\nsenses. So-called abstract art is, in fact, the result of much sense interplay\nwith varying dominance of ear and touch. I would suggest that “touch” is not\nso much a separate sense as the very interplay of the senses. That is why it\nrecedes in significance as the visual faculty is given separate and abstract\nintensity.\n\nIn a very interesting section from his forthcoming book on the beginnings of\nart printed in _Explorations in Communication_ ([pp.\n71](ch02.html#page_71)–89), Giedion explains the space awareness of the cave\npainters:\n\nNo traces of human dwellings have been found in the interior of the caverns.\nThese were holy places in which, with the aid of magically potent pictures,\nthe sacred rituals could be performed.\n\nThese caverns possess no space in our meaning of this word, for in them\nperpetual darkness reigns. The caverns are, spatially speaking, empty. This is\nwell appreciated by anyone who has tried alone to find his way out from one of\nthem. The weak beam of light from his light torch is swallowed up by the\nabsolute darkness around him, while rocky tunnels and crumbling slopes repeat\nthemselves in every direction and re-echo his question: where is the outlet\nfrom this labyrinth?\n\n_Light and the Art of the Caverns_\n\nNothing is more destructive of the true values of primeval art than the glare\nof electric light in this realm of eternal night. Flares or small stone lamps\nburning animal fat, of which examples have been found, permit one to obtain\nonly fragmentary glimpses of the colors and lines of the objects depicted. In\nsuch a soft, flickering light these take on an almost magical movement. The\nengraved lines, and even the colored surfaces, lose their intensity under a\nstrong light and sometimes disappear altogether. Only in this way can the fine\nveining of the drawings be seen unsmothered by their rough background.\n\nMaybe enough has now been said to show that prehistoric man did not associate\nthe caverns with architecture. In his view the caverns simply provided him\nwith places that he could use for his magic arts. He selected these places\nwith the utmost care.\n\nA hole in the ground is not enclosed space because, like a triangle or a\ntepee, it merely exhibits the lines of force. A square does not exhibit the\nlines of force, but is a translation of such tactile space into visual terms.\nNo such translation occurs before writing. And anyone who takes the trouble to\nread Emile Durkheim’s _The Division of Labour_ can find the reasons why. For\nuntil sedentary life permits some specialization of human tasks, there is no\nspecialization of the sense life such as leads to the stepping up of visual\nintensity. Anthropologists have suggested to me that any kind of carving or\nsculpture is already an indication of some stress in the visual area. It would\nseem reasonable, therefore, that nomadic people having very little\nspecialization of tasks or of sense life would never develop rectangular\nspaces. But by the time they showed some sculpture they would be readying\nthemselves for the further degree of visualization that is carving and writing\nand square enclosures. Sculpture, now as ever, is the frontier between the\nspaces of sight and sound. For sculpture is not enclosed space. It modulates\nspace, as does sound. And architecture, too, has this mysterious dimension of\nthe frontier between two worlds of space. Le Corbusier argues that it is best\nfelt at night. It is only partly in the visual mode.\n\nE. S. Carpenter’s book _Eskimo_ is concerned with the space concepts of the\nEskimo, revealing his quite “irrational” or non-visual attitude to spatial\nforms and orientations:\n\nI know of no example of an Aivilik describing space primarily in visual terms.\nThey don’t regard space as static, and therefore measurable; hence they have\nno formal units of spatial measurement, just as they have no uniform divisions\nof time. The carver is indifferent to the demands of the optical eye, he lets\neach piece fill its own space, create its own world, without reference to\nbackground or anything external to it. … In the oral tradition, the myth-\nteller speaks as many-to-many, not as person-to-person. Speech and song are\naddressed to all. … As poet, myth-teller, carver, the Eskimo conveys anonymous\ntradition to all. … The work of art can be seen or heard equally well from any\ndirection.\n\nThe multidirectional space orientation, which is acoustic or auditory, causes\nthe Eskimo to be much amused at squirming efforts of visitors to look at\npictures “right-side up.” Pages from magazines when stuck on igloo ceilings to\nprevent dripping, often tempt the white visitor to crane his neck to see them.\nIn the same way the Eskimo may start a drawing or carving on one side of a\nboard and continue right over. There is no word for art in their language yet:\n“Every Aivilik adult is an accomplished ivory carver: carving is a normal,\nessential requirement, just as writing is with us.”\n\nGiedion pursues the same spatial themes in _Explorations in Communication_\n([p. 84](ch02.html#page_84)): “As is universally the case in primeval art, the\neye of the Ice Age hunter discovers images of the animals he seeks in the\nstructure of the rocks. The French describe this recognition of natural\nformations as “epouser les contours”. A few lines, a little carving, or some\ncolor are enough to bring the animal into view.” Our rediscovery of a passion\nfor contours is inseparable from the recognition of precise interdependence\nand function, and of all forms as organic, which is thrust upon us by the\nelectro-magnetic wave technology. That is, the recovery of primitive organic\nvalues in art and architecture is the central technological pressure of our\ntime. Yet there are some anthropologists even today who vaguely suppose that\nnon-literate men have Euclidean space\nperceptions.[17](ch02a_fn16.html#ch02a_fn16fn17) And many more report their\nprimitive data in terms of Euclidean models of organization. So it is scarcely\nsurprising that a J. C. Carothers should be a rare figure. As a psychologist\nwho crossed functional lines into the anthropological area, he was quite\nunprepared for what he found. What he found is still known to very few people,\nindeed. If the effects of the written word, in substituting visual for\nauditory dimensions of experience, were known to Mircea Eliade, for example,\nwould he continue to express the same zeal for the “resacralizing” of human\nlife?\n\n###\n\nPrimitivism has become the vulgar CLICHÉ of much modern art and speculation.\n\nIt is possible that the entire group influenced by Marinetti and Moholy-Nagy\nhas been beguiled by a misunderstanding of the origins and causes of the\nprofane configuration of life, on one hand, as of the “sacral” configuration,\non the other. On the contrary, it is possible that even admitting the merely\nmechanical operation of technology in “sacralizing” and “desacralizing” human\nlife, that the entire group of “irrationalists” in our century would still\nelect the “sacral” or auditory mode of organization of experience. For one\nthing, it is the emergent mode of the electro-magnetic or electronic, as de\nChardin stresses. And for many the new, as such, is a mandate from outer\nspace, even when it is a plunge back into non-literate patterns of awareness.\nThough we see no inherent religious relevance or importance, either in the\n“sacred” or “profane” as presented by Eliade or any other “irrational” mystic\nof our time, we would not belittle the merely cultural power of the non-\nliterate and the literate forms of life to shape the perceptions and biases of\nthe entire human community. The miseries of conflict between the Eastern and\nRoman churches, for example, are a merely obvious instance of the type of\nopposition between the oral and the visual cultures, having nothing to do with\nthe Faith.\n\nI would ask, however, whether it is not time that we put these “childish\nthings” under some sort of measured restraint so that their perpetual brain-\nwashings of the human community be subjected to some degree of predictable\noperation. It has been said that the inevitable war is one whose causes have\nnot been discerned. Since there can be no greater contradiction or clash in\nhuman cultures than that between those representing the eye and the ear, it is\nnot strange that our metamorphosis into the eye mode of Western man should be\nonly less agonizing than our present shift into the auditory mode of\nelectronic man. But there is enough inner trauma in such change without the\nauditory cultures and the optical cultures flinging themselves at each other\nin outer manifestations of sadistic self-righteousness.\n\nMircea Eliade begins his introduction to _The Sacred and the Profane_ as a\nmanifesto announcing the long-delayed recognition of “the Sacred” or of\nauditory space in our century. He hails ([pp. 8](ch01.html#page_8)–9) Rudolf\nOtto’s _Das Heilige_ (_The Sacred_) of 1917: “Passing over the rational and\nspeculative side of religion, he concentrated chiefly on its irrational\naspect. For Otto had read Luther and had understood what the ‘living God’\nmeant to a believer. It was not the God of the philosophers – of Erasmus, for\nexample; it was not an idea, an abstract notion, a mere moral allegory. It was\na terrible _power_ , manifested in the divine wrath.” Eliade then explains his\nproject: “The aim of the following pages is to illustrate and define this\nopposition between sacred and profane.” Sensing that “the modern Occidental\nexperiences a certain uneasiness before many manifestations of the sacred,” as\nwhen, “for many human beings, the sacred can be manifested in stones or\ntrees,” he proposes to show why man “of the archaic societies tends to live as\nmuch as possible _in_ the sacred or in close proximity to consecrated\nobjects”:\n\nOur chief concern in the following pages will be to elucidate this subject –\nto show in what ways religious man attempts to remain as long as possible in a\nsacred universe, and hence what his total experience of life proves to be in\ncomparison with the experience of the man without religious feeling, of the\nman who lives, or wishes to live, in a desacralized world. It should be said\nat once that the completely profane world, the wholly desacralized cosmos, is\na recent discovery in the history of the human spirit. It does not devolve\nupon us to show by what historical processes and as the result of what changes\nin spiritual attitudes and behavior modern man has desacralized his world and\nassumed a profane existence. For our purpose it is enough to observe that\ndesacralization pervades the entire experience of the nonreligious man of\nmodern societies and that, in consequence, he finds it increasingly difficult\nto rediscover the existential dimensions of religious man in the archaic\nsocieties. ([p. 13](ch02.html#page_13))\n\nEliade is under a gross illusion in supposing that modern man “finds it\nincreasingly difficult to rediscover the existential dimensions of religious\nman in the archaic societies.” Modern man, since the electro-magnetic\ndiscoveries of more than a century ago, is investing himself with all the\ndimensions of archaic man _plus_. The art and scholarship of the past century\nand more have become a monotonous crescendo of archaic primitivism. Eliade’s\nown work is an extreme popularization of such art and scholarship. But that is\nnot to say that he is factually wrong. Certainly he is right in saying that\n“the wholly desacralized cosmos is a recent discovery in the history of the\nhuman spirit.” In fact, the discovery results from the phonetic alphabet and\nthe acceptance of its consequences, especially since Gutenberg. But I question\nthe quality of insight that causes a human voice to quaver and resonate with\nhebdomadal vehemence when citing the “history of the human spirit.”\n\n### THE GUTENBERG GALAXY is concerned to show why alphabetic man was disposed\nto desacralize his mode of being.\n\nThe later section of this book will accept the role declined by Eliade when he\nsays: “It does not devolve upon us to show by what historical processes …\nmodern man has desacralized his world and assumed a profane existence.” To\nshow by exactly what historical process this was done is the theme of _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_. And having shown the process, we can at least make a\nconscious and responsible choice concerning whether we elect once more the\ntribal mode which has such attraction for Eliade:\n\nThe abyss that divides the two modalities of experience – sacred and profane –\nwill be apparent when we come to describe sacred space and the ritual building\nof the human habitation, or the varieties of the religious experience of time,\nor the relations of religious man to nature and the world of tools, or the\nconsecration of human life itself, the sacrality with which man’s vital\nfunctions (food, sex, work and so on) can be charged. Simply calling to mind\nwhat the city or the house, nature, tools, or work have become for modern and\nnonreligious man will show with the utmost vividness all that distinguishes\nsuch a man from a man belonging to any archaic society, or even from a peasant\nof Christian Europe. For modern consciousness, a physiological act – eating,\nsex and so on – is in some only an organic phenomenon, … But for the\nprimitive, such an act is never simply physiological; it is, or can become, a\nsacrament, that is, a communion with the sacred.\n\nThe reader will very soon realize that _sacred_ and _profane_ are two modes of\nbeing in the world, two existential situations assumed by man in the course of\nhis history. These modes of being in the world are not of concern only to the\nhistory of religions or to sociology; they are not the object only of\nhistorical, sociological, or ethnological study. In the last analysis, the\n_sacred_ and _profane_ modes of being depend upon the different positions that\nman has conquered in the cosmos; hence they are of concern both to the\nphilosopher and to anyone seeking to discover the possible dimensions of human\nexistence. ([pp. 14](ch02.html#page_14)–15)\n\nAny oral man is preferred by Eliade to the desacralized or literate man; even\n“a peasant of Christian Europe” retains some of the old auditory resonance and\naura of sacral man, as the Romantics insisted more than two hundred years ago.\nSo long as a culture is non-literate, it has for Eliade the indispensable\nsacral ingredients ([p. 17](ch02.html#page_17)):\n\nIt is obvious, for example, that the symbolisms and cults of Mother Earth, of\nhuman and agricultural fertility, of the sacrality of woman, and the like,\ncould not develop and constitute a complex religious system except through the\ndiscovery of agriculture; it is equally obvious that a preagricultural\nsociety, devoted to hunting, could not feel the sacrality of Mother Earth in\nthe same way or with the same intensity. Hence there are differences in\nreligious experience explained by differences in economy, culture, and social\norganization – in short, by history. Nevertheless, between the nomadic hunters\nand the sedentary cultivators there is a similarity in behavior that seems to\nus infinitely more important than their differences: _both live in a\nsacralized cosmos_ , both share in a cosmic sacrality manifested equally in\nthe animal world and in the vegetable world. We need only compare their\nexistential situations with that of a man of the modern societies _living in a\ndesacralized cosmos_ , and we shall immediately be aware of all that separates\nhim from them.\n\nWe have already seen that sedentary or specialized man, as opposed to nomadic\nman, is on the way to discovery of the visual mode of human experience. But as\nlong as _homo sedens_ avoids the more potent kinds of optical conditioning, as\nfound in literacy, the mere shades of sacral life, as between nomadic and\nsedentary man, do not faze Eliade. That Eliade chooses to call the oral man\n“religious” is, of course, as fanciful and arbitrary as calling blondes\nbestial. But it is not in the least confusing to those who understand that the\n“religious” for Eliade is, as he insists from the start, the irrational. He is\nin that very large company of literacy victims who have acquiesced in\nsupposing that the “rational” is the explicitly lineal, sequential, visual.\nThat is, he prefers to appear as an eighteenth-century mind in rebellion\nagainst the dominant visual mode which then was new. Such was Blake and a host\nof others. Today Blake would be violently anti-Blake, because the Blake\nreaction against the abstract visual is now the dominant _cliché_ and claque\nof the big battalions, as they move in regimented grooves of sensibility.\n\n“For religious man, space is not homogeneous; he experiences interruptions,\nbreaks in it.” ([p. 20](ch02.html#page_20)) Likewise in time. For the modern\nphysicist, as also for the non-literate, space is not homogeneous, nor is\ntime. By contrast, the geometrical space invented in antiquity, far from being\ndiverse, unique, pluralistic, sacral, “can be cut and delimited in any\ndirection; but no qualitative differentiation and, hence, no orientation are\ngiven by virtue of its inherent structure.” ([p. 22](ch02.html#page_22)) The\nnext statement applies entirely to the relative interplay of the optical and\nthe auditory modes in the shaping of human sensibility:\n\nIt must be added at once that such a profane existence is never found in the\npure state. To whatever degree he may have desacralized the world, the man who\nhas made his choice in favor of a profane life never succeeds in completely\ndoing away with religious behavior. This will become clearer as we proceed; it\nwill appear that even the most desacralized existence still preserves traces\nof a religious valorization of the world. ([p. 23](ch02.html#page_23))\n\n### The method of the twentieth century is to use not single but multiple\nmodels for experimental exploration – the technique of the suspended judgment.\n\nWilliam Ivins, Jr., in _Prints and Visual Communications_ , stresses ([p.\n63](ch02.html#page_63)) how natural it is in the world of the written word to\nmove towards a merely nominalist position such as no non-literate man could\ndream of:\n\n… Plato’s Ideas and Aristotle’s forms, essences, and definitions, are\nspecimens of this transference of reality from the object to the exactly\nrepeatable and therefore seemingly permanent verbal formula. An essence, in\nfact, is not part of the object but part of its definition. Also, I believe,\nthe well-known notions of substance and attributable qualities can be derived\nfrom this operational dependence upon exactly repeatable verbal descriptions\nand definitions – for the very linear order in which words have to be used\nresults in a syntactical time order analysis of qualities that actually are\nsimultaneous and so intermingled and interrelated that no quality can be\nremoved from one of the bundles of qualities we call objects without changing\nboth it and all the other qualities. After all, a quality is only a quality of\na group of other qualities, and if you change anyone of the group they all\nnecessarily change. Whatever the situation may be from the point of view of a\nverbalist analysis, from the point of view of visual awarenesses of the kind\nthat have to be used in an art museum the object is a unity that cannot be\nbroken down into separate qualities without becoming merely a collection of\nabstractions that have only conceptual existence and no actuality. In a funny\nway words and their necessary linear syntactical order forbid us to describe\nobjects and compel us to use very poor and inadequate lists of theoretical\ningredients in the manner exemplified more concretely by the ordinary cook\nbook recipes.\n\nAny phonetic alphabet culture can easily slip into the habit of putting one\nthing under or in another; since there is constant pressure from the\nsubliminal fact that the written code carries for the reader the experience of\nthe “content” which is speech. But there is nothing subliminal in non-literate\ncultures. The reason we find myths difficult to grasp is just this fact, that\nthey do not exclude any facet of experience as literate cultures do. All the\nlevels of meaning are simultaneous. Thus natives, when asked Freudian\nquestions about the symbolism of their thoughts or dreams, insist that all the\nmeanings are right there in the verbal statement. The work of Jung and Freud\nis a laborious translation of non-literate awareness into literary terms, and\nlike any translation distorts and omits. The main advantage in translation is\nthe creative effort it fosters, as Ezra Pound spent his life in telling and\nillustrating. And culture that is engaged in translating itself from one\nradical mode such as the auditory, into another mode like the visual, is bound\nto be in a creative ferment, as was classical Greece or the Renaissance. But\nour own time is an even more massive instance of such ferment, and just\nbecause of such “translation.”\n\nAs our age translates itself back into the oral and auditory modes because of\nthe electronic pressure of simultaneity, we become sharply aware of the\nuncritical acceptance of visual metaphors and models by many past centuries.\nThe linguistic analysis now followed by Gilbert Ryle at Oxford is an\nunremitting critique of visual models in philosophy:\n\nWe should begin by dismissing a model which in one form or another dominates\nmany speculations about perception. The beloved but spurious question, ‘How\ncan a person get beyond his sensations to apprehension of external realities?’\nis often posed as if the situation were like this. There is immured in a\nwindowless cell a prisoner, who has lived there in solitary confinement since\nbirth. All that comes to him from the outside world is flickers of light\nthrown upon his cell-walls and tappings heard through the stones; yet from\nthese observed flashes and tappings he becomes, or seems to become, apprised\nof unobserved football-matches, flower-gardens and eclipses of the sun. How\nthen does he learn the ciphers in which his signals are arranged, or even find\nout that there are such things as ciphers? How can he interpret the messages\nwhich he somehow deciphers, given that the vocabularies of those messages are\nthe vocabularies of football and astronomy and not those of flickers and\ntappings?\n\nThis model is of course the familiar picture of the mind as a ghost in a\nmachine, about the general defects of which nothing more need be said. But\ncertain particular defects do need to be noticed. The use of this sort of\nmodel involves the explicit or implicit assumption that, much as the prisoner\ncan see flickers and hear tappings, but cannot, unfortunately, see or hear\nfootball matches, so we can observe our visual and other sensations, but\ncannot, unfortunately, observe robins.[18](ch02a_fn17.html#ch02a_fn17fn18)\n\nWe become extremely conscious of cultural models and bias when moving from one\ndominant form of awareness to another, as between Greek and Latin or English\nand French. So we are no longer amazed that the oriental world has no concept\nof “substance” or of “substantial form,” since they experience no visual\npressure to break up experience into such packages. And we have seen how his\ntraining in the world of prints enabled William Ivins to translate the meaning\nof typography as nobody else has done. In his _Prints and Visual\nCommunication_ ([p. 54](ch02.html#page_54)) he offers a general principle:\n\nThus the more closely we can confine our data for reasoning about things to\ndata that come to us through one and the same sense channel the more apt we\nare to be correct in our reasoning, even though it be much more restricted in\nits scope. One of the most interesting things in our modern scientific\npractice has been the invention and perfection of methods by which the\nscientists can acquire much of their basic data through one and the same\nsensuous channel of awareness. I understand that in physics, for example, the\nscientists are happiest when they can get their data with the aid of some dial\nor other device which can be read by vision. Thus heat, weight, lengths, and\nmany other things that in ordinary life are apprehended through senses other\nthan vision have become for science matters of visual awareness of the\npositions of mechanical pointers.\n\nDoes this not imply that if we can devise a consistent means of translating\n_all_ aspects of our world into the language of _one_ sense only, we shall\nthen have a distortion that is scientific because consistent and coherent?\nBlake thought this had actually occurred in the eighteenth century when he\nsought liberation “from single vision and Newton’s sleep.” For the dominance\nof one sense is the formula for hypnosis. And a culture can be locked in the\nsleep of any one sense. The sleeper awakes when challenged in any other sense.\n\n### Only a fraction of the history of literacy has been typographic.\n\nTill now we have been concerned mostly with the written word as it transfers\nor translates the audile-tactile space of “sacral” non-literate man into the\nvisual space of civilized or literate or “profane” man. Once this transfer or\nmetamorphosis occurs we are soon in the world of books, scribal or\ntypographic. The rest of our concern will be with books written and printed\nand the results for learning and society. From the fifth century B.C. to the\nfifteenth century A.D. the book was a scribal product. Only one third of the\nhistory of the book in the Western world has been typographic. It is not\nincongruous, therefore, to say as G. S. Brett does in _Psychology Ancient and\nModern_ ([pp. 36](ch02.html#page_36)–7):\n\nThe idea that knowledge is essentially book learning seems to be a very modern\nview, probably derived from the mediaeval distinctions between clerk and\nlayman, with additional emphasis provided by the literary character of the\nrather fantastic humanism of the sixteenth century. The original and natural\nidea of knowledge is that of “cunning” or the possession of wits. Odysseus is\nthe original type of thinker, a man of many ideas who could overcome the\nCyclops and achieve a significant triumph of mind over matter. Knowledge is\nthus a capacity for overcoming the difficulties of life and achieving success\nin this world.\n\nBrett here specifies the natural dichotomy which the book brings into any\nsociety, in addition to the split within the individual of that society. The\nwork of James Joyce exhibits a complex clairvoyance in these matters. His\nLeopold Bloom of _Ulysses_ , a man of many ideas and many devices, is a free-\nlance ad salesman. Joyce saw the parallels, on one hand, between the modern\nfrontier of the verbal and the pictorial and, on the other, between the\nHomeric world poised between the old sacral culture and the new profane or\nliterate sensibility. Bloom, the newly detribalized Jew, is presented in\nmodern Dublin, a slightly detribalized Irish world. Such a frontier is the\nmodern world of the advertisement, congenial, therefore, to the transitional\nculture of Bloom. In the seventeenth or Ithaca episode of _Ulysses_ we read:\n“What were habitually his final meditations? Of some one sole unique\nadvertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all\nextraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient\nterms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity\nof modern life.”\n\nIn the _Books at the Wake_ , James S. Atherton points out ([pp.\n67](ch02.html#page_67)–8):\n\nAmongst other things _Finnegans Wake_ is a history of writing. We begin with\nwriting on “A bone, a pebble, a ramskin … leave them to cook in the mutthering\npot: and Gutenmorg with his cromagnon charter, tintingfats and great prime\nmust once for omniboss stepp rubrickredd out of the wordpress” (20.5). The\n“mutthering pot” is an allusion to Alchemy, but there is some other\nsignificance connected with writing, for the next time the word appears it is\nagain in a context concerning improvement in systems of communication. The\npassage is: “All the airish signics of her dipandump helpabit from an Father\nHogam till the Mutther Masons, …” (223.3). “Dipandump helpabit” combine the\ndeaf and dumb alphabet’s signs in the air – or airish signs – with the ups and\ndowns of the ordinary ABC and the more pronounced ups and downs of Irish Ogham\nwriting. The Mason, following this, must be the man of that name who invented\nsteel pen nibs. But all I can suggest for “mutther” is the muttering of\nFreemasons which does not fit the context, although they, of course, also make\nsigns in the air.\n\n“Gutenmorg with his cromagnon charter” expounds by mythic gloss the fact that\nwriting meant the emergence of the caveman or sacral man from the audile world\nof simultaneous resonance into the profane world of daylight. The reference to\nthe masons is to the world of the bricklayer as a type of speech itself. On\nthe second page of the _Wake_ , Joyce is making a mosaic, an Achilles shield,\nas it were, of all the themes and modes of human speech and communication:\n“Bygmeister Finnegan, of the Stuttering Hand, freemen’s maurer, lived in the\nbroadest way immarginable in his ruchlit toofarback for messuages before\njoshuan judges had given us numbers …” Joyce is, in the _Wake_ , making his\nown Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms\nof its basic gestures and postures during all phases of human culture and\ntechnology. As his title indicates, he saw that the wake of human progress can\ndisappear again into the night of sacral or auditory man. The Finn cycle of\ntribal institutions can return in the electric age, but if again, then let’s\nmake it a wake or awake or both. Joyce could see no advantage in our remaining\nlocked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream. He discovered the\nmeans of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.\nThe means he cites for such self-awareness and correction of cultural bias is\nhis “collideorscope.” This term indicates the interplay in colloidal mixture\nof all components of human technology as they extend our senses and shift\ntheir ratios in the social kaleidoscope of cultural clash: “deor,” savage, the\noral or sacral; “scope” the visual or profane and civilized.\n\n### Until now a culture has been a mechanical fate for societies, the\nautomatic interiorization of their own technologies.\n\nHitherto most people have accepted their cultures as a fate, like climate or\nvernacular; but our empathic awareness of the exact modes of many cultures is\nitself a liberation from them as prisons. Hence Joyce’s title is also a\nmanifesto. In a most competent survey, _Man: His First Million Years_ , Ashley\nMontagu comments ([pp. 193](ch02a.html#page_193)–4) on aspects of non-literacy\nin a way that relates to these themes:\n\nNonliterate man casts the net of thought over the whole world. Mythology and\nreligion may be closely related, but where one grows out of man’s everyday\nlife, the other grows out of his concern with the supernatural. And so it is\nwith his view of the world, which will be compounded of secular, religious,\nmythological, magical, and experiential elements all rolled into one.\n\nMost nonliterate peoples are extreme realists. They are bent on bringing the\nworld under control, and many of their practices are devised to insure that\nreality will perform according to their bidding. In the conviction that the\nspirits are on his side, a man may then make all the necessary preparations\nfor the success of an expedition. Coercing reality to do one’s bidding by\nmanipulating it in the prescribed manner is, for the nonliterate, a part of\nreality.\n\nIt is necessary to understand that nonliterate peoples identify themselves\nvery much more closely with the world in which they live than do the literate\npeoples of the world. The more “literate” people become, the more they tend to\nbecome detached from the world in which they live.\n\nWhat happens _is_ reality to the nonliterate. If ceremonies calculated to\nincrease the birth of animals and the yield of plants are followed by such\nincreases, then the ceremonies are not only connected with them but are part\nof them; for without the ceremonies the increase of animals and plants would\nnot have occurred – so the nonliterate reasons. It is not that the nonliterate\nis characterized by an illogical mind; his mind is perfectly logical, and he\nuses it very well, indeed. An educated white man finding himself suddenly\ndeposited in the Central Australian desert would be unlikely to last very\nlong. Yet the Australian aboriginal manages very well. The aboriginals of all\nlands have made adjustments to their environments which indicate beyond any\ndoubt that their intelligence is of high order. The trouble with the\nnonliterate is not that he isn’t logical, but that he applies logic too often,\nmany times on the basis of insufficient premises. He generally assumes that\nevents which are associated together are causally connected. But this is a\nfallacy which the majority of civilized people commit most of the time, and it\nhas been known to happen among trained scientists! Nonliterates tend to adhere\ntoo rigidly to the rule of association as causation, but most of the time it\nworks, and by the pragmatic rule what works is taken to be true.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth than the idea that nonliterates are\nutterly credulous, superstition- and fear-ridden creatures, without any\ncapacity or opportunity for independent and original thought. In addition to\ngood horse sense, the nonliterate usually displays much practical sense based\non an appreciation of the hard realities of life. …\n\nWhat Montagu opens up here concerning the intense practicality of the non-\nliterate applies perfectly as gloss to Joyce’s Bloom or Odysseus, the\nresourceful man. What could be more practical for a man caught between the\nScylla of a literary culture and the Charybdis of post-literate technology to\nmake himself a raft of ad copy? He is behaving like Poe’s sailor in the\n_Maelstrom_ who studied the action of the whirlpool and survives. May not it\nbe our job in the new electronic age to study the action of the new vortex on\nthe body of the older cultures?\n\n### The techniques of uniformity and repeatability were introduced by the\nRomans and the Middle Ages.\n\n_Prints and Visual Communication_ by William Ivins is a major resource for any\nstudent of the role of books in shaping human knowledge and society. The fact\nthat Ivins stood a bit aside from the central literary aspect of the book\nseems to have given him an advantage over literary men. The student of\nliterature and philosophy is prone to be concerned with book “content” and to\nignore its form. This failure is peculiar to phonetic literacy in which the\nvisual code always has the “content” that is the speech recreated by the\nperson engaged in reading. No Chinese scribe or reader could make the mistake\nof ignoring the form of writing itself, because his written character does not\nseparate speech and visual code in our way. But in a world of phonetic\nliteracy this compulsion to split form and content is universal, and affects\nnon-literary people as much as the scholar. Thus the Bell Telephone\nLaboratories spend millions on research but have never even noticed the\npeculiar form that is the telephone and what it does to speech and to personal\nrelations. As an expert in prints Ivins became aware of their difference from\nthe printed books in which they appeared. This in turn made him aware of the\ngreat difference between printed and manuscript books. At the outset ([pp.\n2](ch01.html#page_2)–3) he draws attention to the dimension of repeatability\nbuilt into the phonetic written characters, in order to stress the same\ndimensions of repeatability as it is found in pre-Gutenberg block printing of\npictures from woodcuts:\n\nAlthough every history of European civilization makes much of the invention in\nthe mid-fifteenth century of ways to print words from movable types, it is\ncustomary in those histories to ignore the slightly earlier discovery of ways\nto print pictures and diagrams. A book, so far as it contains a text, is a\ncontainer of exactly repeatable word symbols arranged in an exactly repeatable\norder. Men have been using such containers for at least five thousand years.\nBecause of this it can be argued that the printing of books was no more than a\nway of making very old and familiar things more cheaply. It may even be said\nthat for a while type printing was little more than a way to do with a much\nsmaller number of proof readings. Prior to 1501 few books were printed in\neditions larger than that handwritten one of a thousand copies to which Pliny\nthe Younger referred in the second century of our era. The printing of\npictures, however, unlike the printing of words from movable types, brought a\ncompletely new thing into existence – it made possible for the first time\npictorial statements of a kind that could be exactly repeated during the\neffective life of the printing surface. This exact repetition of pictorial\nstatements has had incalculable effects upon knowledge and thought, upon\nscience and technology, of every kind. It is hardly too much to say that since\nthe invention of writing there has been no more important invention than that\nof the exactly repeatable pictorial statement.\n\nThe too obvious character of exact repeatability that is inherent in\ntypography misses the literary man. He attaches little significance to this\nmerely technological feature and concentrates on the “content,” as if he were\nlistening to the author. As an artist aware of formal structures as complex\nstatements in themselves, Ivins brought to prints and typography and\nmanuscript alike, a rare mode of attention. He saw ([p. 3](ch01.html#page_3))\nhow technological forms can shape the sciences as much as the arts:\n\nFor our great grandfathers, and for their fathers back to the Renaissance,\nprints were no more and no less than the only exactly repeatable pictorial\nstatements. … Until a century ago, prints made in the old techniques filled\nall the functions that are now filled by our line cuts and half tones, by our\nphotographs and blueprints, by our various colour processes, and by our\npolitical cartoons and pictorial advertisements. If we define prints from the\nfunctional point of view so indicated, rather than by any restriction of\nprocess or aesthetic value, it becomes obvious that without prints we should\nhave very few of our modern sciences, technologies, archaeologies, or\nethnologies – for all of these are dependent, first or last, upon information\nconveyed by exactly repeatable visual or pictorial statements.\n\nThis means that, far from being merely minor works of art, prints are among\nthe most important and powerful tools of modern life and thought. Certainly we\ncannot hope to realize their actual role unless we get away from the snobbery\nof modern print collecting notions and definitions and begin to think of them\nas exactly repeatable pictorial statements or communications, without regard\nto the accident of rarity or what for the moment we may regard as aesthetic\nmerit. We must look at them from the point of view of general ideas and\nparticular functions, and, especially, we must think about the limitations\nwhich their techniques have imposed on them as conveyors of information and on\nus as receivers of that information.\n\nThe technology of exact repeatability was a stress that the Romans introduced\ninto the Greek visual analysis. This stress on the continuous, uniform line\nwith its indifference to the oral values of pluralistic organization was, in\nthe view of Ivins ([pp. 4](ch01.html#page_4)–5) effectively transmitted to and\nby the Dark Ages:\n\nHistorians until very recent times have been literary men and philologues. As\nstudents of the past they have rarely found anything they were not looking\nfor. They have been so full of wonder at what the Greeks said, that they have\npaid little attention to what the Greeks did not do or know. They have been so\nfull of horror at what the Dark Ages did not say, that they have paid no\nattention to what they did do and know. Modern research, by men who are aware\nof low subjects like economics and technology, is rapidly changing our ideas\nabout these matters. In the Dark Ages to use their traditional name, there was\nlittle assured leisure for pursuit of the niceties of literature, art,\nphilosophy, and theoretical science, but many people, nevertheless addressed\ntheir perfectly good minds to social, agricultural, and mechanical problems.\nMoreover, all through those academically debased centuries, so far from there\nhaving been any falling off in mechanical ability, there was an unbroken\nseries of discoveries and inventions that gave the Dark Ages, and after them\nthe Middle Ages, a technology, and, therefore, a logic, that in many most\nimportant respects far surpassed anything that had been known to the Greeks or\nto the Romans of the Western Empire.\n\nHis theme is that “the Dark and Middle Ages in their poverty and necessity\nproduced the first great crop of Yankee ingenuity.” Perhaps Ivins overdoes\nthis emphasis on the Dark and Middle Ages as “a culture of techniques and\ntechnologies,” but it is a kind of approach which makes scholasticism\nunderstandable, and that prepares us for the great medieval invention of\ntypography that was the “take-off” moment into the new spaces of the modern\nworld.[19](ch02a_fn18.html#ch02a_fn18fn19)\n\n### The word **MODERN** was a term of reproach used by the patristic humanists\nagainst the medieval schoolmen who developed the new logic and physics.\n\nSince then many books on medieval science have appeared which confirm the\nIvins view. _The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages_ by Marshall Clagett\nis an example from which I will select a few themes that illustrate the\ncontinuous development of the visual stress which we have seen emerge in the\nGreek world as an effect of phonetic literacy. Thus: “It will be evident from\nthe material I have presented in the first two chapters that medieval statics,\nlike the other aspects of medieval mechanics, depends greatly on the\nmechanical concepts and their analysis given by Greek mechanicians: the\nAristotelian author of the _Mechanica_ , Archimedes, Hero, and others.” (p.\nxxiii)\n\nIn the same way “the achievements of medieval kinematics were very much more\nan integral part of the scholastic discussions of Aristotelian statements\nregarding force and motion … Particularly important was the development of a\nconcept of instantaneous velocity and consequently of an analysis of various\nkinds of acceleration.” (p. xxv)\n\nMore than a century before printing, scientists at Merton College, Oxford,\ndeveloped a theorem of “a uniform acceleration and a movement uniform at the\nspeed possessed by the uniformly accelerating body at the middle instant of\nthe time of acceleration.” With the invention of uniform repeatable and\nmovable types we enter further into this medieval world of measurable\nquantities. What Clagett does is to establish the lines of continuity between\nGreek visual analysis and medieval science, and to show how much further the\nscholastic mind pushed the Greek concepts.\n\nThe Merton kinematics spread to Italy and France. This was an idea for\ntranslating motion into visual terms:\n\nThe basic idea of the system is simple. Geometric figures, particularly areas,\ncan be used to represent the quantity of a quality. Extension of the quality\nin a subject is to be represented by a horizontal line, while the qualitative\nintensities at different points in the subject are to be represented by\nperpendiculars erected on the extension or subject line. In the case of\nmotion, the line of extension represents time, and the line of intensity,\nvelocity. ([p. 33](ch02.html#page_33))\n\nClagett presents the treatise of Nicholas of Oresme “On the Configurations of\nQualities” in which Oresme says: “Every measurable thing except numbers is\nconceived in the manner of continuous quantity.” This recalls us to the Greek\nworld in which as Tobias D. Dantzig points out in his _Number: The Language of\nScience_ ([pp. 141](ch02a.html#page_141)–2):\n\nThe attempt to apply rational arithmetic to a problem in geometry resulted in\nthe first crisis in the history of mathematics. The two relatively simple\nproblems, the determination of the diagonal of a square and that of the\ncircumference of a circle, revealed the existence of new mathematical beings\nfor which no place could be found within the rational domain …\n\nA further analysis showed that the procedures of algebra were generally just\nas inadequate. So it became apparent that an extension of the number field was\nunavoidable. … And since the old concept failed on the terrain of geometry, we\nmust seek in geometry a model for the new. The continuous indefinite straight\nline seems ideally adapted for such a model.\n\nNumber is the dimension of tactility, as Ivins explained in _Art and Geometry_\n([p. 7](ch01.html#page_7)): “In any continuous pattern the hand needs simple\nand static forms and it likes repeated ones. It knows objects separately, one\nafter another, and unlike the eye it has no way of getting a practically\nsimultaneous view or acquaintance with a group of objects as a single\nawareness. Unlike the eye, the unaided hand is unable to discover whether\nthree or more objects are on a line.”\n\nBut what concerns us about the first crisis in mathematics is the evident\nfictions which must be resorted to in order to translate the visual into the\ntactile. But the greater fictions lay ahead in the infinitesimal calculus.\n\nAs we shall see, with regard to the sixteenth century, number and visuality,\nor tactility and retinal experience, split quite asunder and went their\ndivergent ways to set up the rival empires of Art and Science. This\ndivergence, so strikingly initiated in the Greek world, was held in relative\nabeyance until the Gutenberg take-off. Throughout the centuries of manuscript\nculture it will appear that the visual did not become quite dissociated from\ntactility, even though it diminished the auditory empire drastically. This\nmatter will get separate discussion apropos of medieval reading habits. The\nrelation of tactility to the visual, so necessary to an understanding of the\nfortunes of the phonetic alphabet, only became starkly defined after Cézanne.\nThus Gombrich makes tactility a central theme of _Art and Illusion_ , as does\nHeinrich Wolfflin in his _Principles of Art History._ And the reason for this\nnew stress was that in an age of photography the divorce of the visual from\nthe interplay of the other senses was pushed all the way into reaction.\nGombrich records the stages of nineteenth-century discussion and analysis of\n“sense data” leading to the Helmholtz case for “unconscious inference” or\nmental action even in the most basic sense experience. “Tactility” or\ninterplay among all the senses was felt to be the very mode of this\n“inference” and led at once to the disintegration of the idea of the\n“imitation of nature” as a visual affair. Gombrich writes ([p.\n16](ch02.html#page_16)):\n\nTwo German thinkers are prominent in this story. One is the critic Konrad\nFiedler, who insisted, in opposition to the impressionists, that “even the\nsimplest sense impression that looks like merely the raw material for the\noperations of the mind is already a mental fact, and what we call the external\nworld is really the result of a complex psychological process.”\n\nBut it was Fiedler’s friend, the neoclassical sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand,\nwho set out to analyze this process in a little book called _The Problem of\nForm in the Figurative Arts_ , which came out in 1893 and gained the ear of a\nwhole generation. Hildebrand, too, challenged the ideals of scientific\nnaturalism by an appeal to the psychology of perception: if we attempt to\nanalyze our mental images to discover their primary constituents, we will find\nthem composed of sense data derived from vision and from memories of touch and\nmovement. A sphere, for instance, appears to the eye as a flat disk; it is\ntouch which informs us of the properties of space and form. Any attempt on the\npart of the artist to eliminate this knowledge is futile, for without it he\nwould not perceive the world at all. His task is, on the contrary, to\ncompensate for the absence of movement in his work by clarifying his image and\nthus conveying not only visual sensations but also those memories of touch\nwhich enable us to reconstitute the three-dimensional form in our minds.\n\nIt is hardly an accident that the period when these ideas were so eagerly\ndebated was also the period when the history of art emancipated itself from\nantiquarianism, biography, and aesthetics. Issues which had been taken for\ngranted so long suddenly looked problematic and required reassessment. When\nBernard Berenson wrote his brilliant essay on the Florentine painters, which\ncame out in 1896, he formulated his aesthetic creed in terms of Hildebrand’s\nanalysis. With his gift for the pregnant phrase, he summed up almost the whole\nof the sculptor’s somewhat turgid book in the sentence “The painter can\naccomplish his task only by giving tactile value to retinal impressions.” For\nBerenson, Giotto’s or Pollaiuolo’s claim on our attention is that they had\ndone precisely this …\n\n### In antiquity and the Middle Ages reading was necessarily reading aloud.\n\n“It is not too much to say that with Aristotle the Greek world passed from\noral instruction to the habit of reading,” writes Frederic G. Kenyon in _Books\nand Readers in Ancient Greece and Rome_ ([p. 25](ch02.html#page_25)). But for\ncenturies to come “reading” meant reading aloud. In fact, it is only today\nthat the decree _nisi_ has been handed down by the speed-reading institutes to\ndivorce eye and speech in the act of reading. The recognition that in reading\nfrom left to right we make incipient word formations with our throat muscles\nwas discovered to be the principal cause of “slow” reading. But the hushing up\nof the reader has been a gradual process, and even the printed word did not\nsucceed in silencing all readers. But we have tended to associate lip\nmovements and mutterings from a reader with semi-literacy, a fact which has\ncontributed to the American stress on a merely visual approach to reading in\nelementary learning. Yet Gerard Manley Hopkins was crusading for tactile\nstress in word use and for vigorous oral poetry exactly at the time that\nCézanne was giving tactile values to the retinal impression. Referring to his\npoem “Spelt from Sibyl’s Leaves,” Hopkins wrote:\n\nOf this long sonnet above all remember what applies to all my verse, that it\nis, as living art should be, made for performance and that its performance is\nnot reading with the eye but loud, leisurely, poetical (not rhetorical)\nrecitation, with long rests, long dwells on the rhyme and other marked\nsyllables, and so on. This sonnet should be sung: it is most carefully timed\nin _tempo rubato._[ 20](ch02a_fn19.html#ch02a_fn19fn20)\n\nAgain he writes: “Take breath and read it with the ears, as I always wish to\nbe read, and my verse comes all right.” And Joyce never tired of explaining\nhow in _Finnegans Wake_ “the words the reader sees are not the words that he\nwill hear.” As with Hopkins, the language of Joyce only comes alive when read\naloud, creating a synesthesia or interplay of the senses.\n\nBut if reading aloud favours synesthesia and tactility, so did the ancient and\nmedieval manuscript. We have already seen an example of a recent attempt to\ncreate an oral typography for modern English readers. Naturally, such a script\npresents the highly textural and tactile mode of an old manuscript. “Textura,”\nthe name for Gothic lettering in its own time, meant “tapestry.” But the\nRomans had developed a much less textural and more highly visual lettering\nwhich is called “Roman” and which is the lettering we find in ordinary print,\nas on this page. But the early printers avoided Roman letters except to create\nthe illusion of the fake antique, of the old Roman letters beloved of the\nRenaissance humanists.\n\nIt is strange that modern readers have been so slow to recognize that the\nprose of Gertrude Stein with its lack of punctuation and other visual aids, is\na carefully devised strategy to get the passive visual reader into\nparticipant, oral action. So with E. E. Cummings, or Pound, or Eliot. _Vers\nlibre_ is for the ear as much as for the eye. And in _Finnegans Wake_ when\nJoyce wants to create “thunder,” the “shout in the street” indicating a major\nphase of collective action, he sets up the word exactly like an ancient\nmanuscript word: “The fall\n(bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawn  \nskawntoohoohooardenenthurnuk!) of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early\nin bed and later on life down through all christian minstrelsy …” ([p.\n1](ch01.html#page_1))\n\nIn the absence of visual aids the reader will find himself doing exactly what\nancient and medieval readers did, namely reading aloud. Readers continued to\nread aloud after the beginning of word separation in the later Middle Ages,\nand even after the coming of print in the Renaissance. But all these\ndevelopments fostered speed and visual stress. Today, scholars using\nmanuscripts read them silently for the most part, and the study of reading\nhabits in the ancient and medieval world remains to be done. The comments of\nKenyon (in his _Books and Readers in Ancient Greece and Rome_ , [p.\n65](ch02.html#page_65)) are helpful: “The lack of assistance to readers, or of\naids to facilitate reference, in ancient books is very remarkable. The\nseparation of words is practically unknown, except very rarely when an\ninverted comma or dot is used to mark a separation where some ambiguity might\nexist. Punctuation is often wholly absent, and is never full and systematic.”\n“Full and systematic” would be for the eye, whereas punctuation even in the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries continued to be for the ear and not the\neye.[21](ch02a_fn20.html#ch02a_fn20fn21)\n\n### Manuscript culture is conversational if only because the writer and his\naudience are physically related by the form of **PUBLICATION AS PERFORMANCE**.\n\nThere is no lack of indication that “reading” throughout ancient and medieval\ntimes meant reading aloud, or even a kind of incantation. But nobody has ever\ngathered adequate data on this question. I can at least give a few samples\nfrom various periods of the sort of evidence that is readily available. Thus\nin his _Poetics_ (26) Aristotle points out: “That Tragedy may produce its\neffect even without movement or action in just the same way as Epic poetry;\nfor from the mere reading of a play its quality may be seen.” Sidelights on\nthe above aspect of reading as recitation are available from the Roman\npractice of public recitation as a principal form of book publication. Such it\nremained until printing. Kenyon (_Books and Readers_ , [pp.\n83](ch02.html#page_83)–4) reports on the Roman practice:\n\nTacitus describes how an author would be compelled to hire a house and chairs,\nand collect an audience by personal entreaty; and Juvenal complains that a\nrich man would lend his disused house, and send his freedmen and poor clients\nto form an audience, but would not bear the cost of the chairs. The whole\npractice finds its analogy in the modern musical world, where a singer is\ncompelled to hire a hall and do his best to collect an audience, in order that\nhis voice may be heard; or a patron desiring to assist him may lend his\ndrawing-room for the purpose, and use his influence to get his friends to\nattend. It was not a healthy phase for literature, since it encouraged\ncompositions which lent themselves to rhetorical declamation; and one may\ndoubt whether it did any service to the circulation of books.\n\nMoses Hadas in his _Ancilla to Classical Reading_ goes into the question of\noral publication more thoroughly than Kenyon ([p. 50](ch02.html#page_50)):\n\nThe concept of literature as something to be listened to in public rather than\nscanned silently in private in itself makes the notion of literary property\nmore difficult to grasp. We ourselves are more conscious of an author’s\ncontribution when we read his book than we are of a composer’s when we hear\nhis work performed. Among the Greeks the regular method of publication was by\npublic recitation, at first, significantly, by the author himself, and then by\nprofessional readers or actors, and public recitation continued to be the\nregular method of publication even after books and the art of reading had\nbecome common. How this affected the poet’s livelihood we shall see in another\nconnection; here we may pause to notice the effect of oral presentation on the\ncharacter of the literature.\n\nJust as music written for a small group of instruments has a different tone\nand tempo from music designed for large halls, so with books. Printing has\nenlarged the “hall” for the author’s performance until all aspects of style\nhave been altered. Hadas is most relevant here:\n\nAll classic literature, it may be said, is conceived of as conversation with,\nor an address to, an audience. Ancient drama is significantly different from\nmodern because plays acted in bright sunlight before 40,000 spectators cannot\nbe like plays acted before 400 in a darkened room. Similarly, a piece intended\nfor declamation at a festival cannot be like a piece intended for the perusal\nof a cloistered student. Poetry in particular shows that all its varieties\nwere intended for oral presentation. Even epigrams represent a vocal address\nto the passer-by (“Go, stranger,” or the like) and sometimes, as in some of\nthe epigrams of Callimachus and of his imitators, the stone is thought of as\ncarrying on a brief dialogue with the passer-by. Homeric epic was of course\ndesigned for public reading, and long after private reading became common,\nrhapsodes made a profession of reciting epic. Pisistratus, who had something\n(we do not know how much) to do with regularizing the text of Homer, also\ninstituted the public reading of his poems at the Panathenaic festival. From\nDiogenes Laertius (1.2.57) we learn that ‘Solon provided that the public\nrecitations of Homer shall follow a fixed order; thus the second reciter must\nbegin from the place where the first left off.’\n\nProse no less than poetry was presented orally, as we know from reports\nconcerning Herodotus and others, and the practice of oral presentation\naffected the nature of prose as it did of poetry. The elaborate attention to\nsound which characterizes Gorgias’ pioneer productions would have been\nmeaningless unless his pieces were intended for recitation. It was the\nartfulness which Gorgias gave it that enabled Isocrates to maintain that prose\nwas the legitimate successor of poetry and must replace it. Later critics like\nDionysius of Halicarnassus judge historians by the same gauge as oratory and\nmake comparisons between their works with no allowances for what we should\nconsider necessary differences in genera. ([pp. 50](ch02.html#page_50)–1)\n\nHadas then turns ([pp. 51](ch02.html#page_51)–2) to the well-known passage in\nSt. Augustine’s _Confessions:_\n\nThroughout antiquity and long thereafter even private readers regularly\npronounced the words of their text aloud, in prose as well as poetry. Silent\nreading was such an anomaly that St. Augustine (_Confessions_ 5, 3) finds\nAmbrose’s habit a very remarkable thing: “But when he was reading his eye\nglided over the pages and his heart searched out the sense, but his voice and\ntongue were at rest.” Visitors came to watch this prodigy, and Augustine\nconjectures explanations:\n\n‘Perchance he dreaded lest if the author he read should deliver anything\nobscurely, some attentive or perplexed hearer should desire him to expound it,\nor to discuss some of the harder questions; so that his time being thus spent,\nhe could not turn over so many volumes as he desired; although the preserving\nof his voice (which a very little speaking would weaken) might be the truer\nreason for his reading to himself. But with what intent soever he did it,\ncertainly in such a man it was good.’\n\n### The manuscript shaped medieval literary conventions at all levels.\n\nHadas pursues this theme elsewhere in his excellent work. And it is taken up\nagain for the medieval period by H. J. Chaytor in _From Script to Print_ , a\nbook to which the present one owes a good deal of its reason for being\nwritten.\n\nNo one is likely to contest the statement that the invention of printing and\nthe development of that art mark a turning-point in the history of\ncivilisation. Not so readily appreciated is the fact that association with\nprinted matter has changed our views of literary art and style, has introduced\nideas concerning originality and literary property of which the age of\nmanuscript knew little or nothing, and has modified the psychological\nprocesses by which we use words for the communication of thought. The breadth\nof the gulf which separates the age of manuscript from the age of print is not\nalways, nor fully, realised by those who begin to read and criticise medieval\nliterature. When we take up a printed edition of a medieval text, provided\nwith an introduction, a critical apparatus of variant readings, notes and\nglossary, we bring unconsciously to its perusal those prejudices and\nprepossessions which years of association with printed matter have made\nhabitual. We are liable to forget that we are dealing with the literature of\nan age when orthographical standards varied and grammatical accuracy was not\nhighly esteemed, when language was fluid and was not necessarily regarded as a\nmark of nationality, when style meant the observance of fixed and complicated\nrules of rhetoric. To copy and circulate another man’s book might be regarded\nas a meritorious action in the age of manuscript; in the age of print, such\naction results in law suits and damages. Writers who wish to derive profit by\namusing a public now write for the most part in prose; until the middle of the\nthirteenth century, only verse could obtain a hearing. Hence, if a fair\njudgment is to be passed upon literary works belonging to the centuries before\nprinting was invented, some effort must be made to realise the extent of the\nprejudices under which we have grown up, and to resist the involuntary demand\nthat medieval literature must conform to our standards of taste or be regarded\nas of interest purely antiquarian. In the words of Renan, “l’essence de la\ncritique est de savoir comprendre des états très différents de celui où nous\nvivons.” ([p. 1](ch01.html#page_1))\n\nIt was learning from Chaytor how literary conventions are affected by the\noral, written, or the printed forms, that suggested to me the need for _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_. Medieval language and literature were somewhat in the state\nof the present movie or the TV show in that, in Chaytor’s words, it\n\nproduced little formal criticism in our sense of the term. If an author wished\nto know whether his work was good or bad, he tried it on an audience; if it\nwas approved, he was soon followed by imitators. But authors were not\nconstrained by models or systems … the audience wanted a story with plenty of\naction and movement, the story, as a rule, showed no great command of\ncharacter drawing; this was left to the reciter for portrayal by change of\nvoice and gesture. ([p. 3](ch01.html#page_3))\n\nThe twelfth century audience took these recitals in instalments but “we can\nsit and read it at our leisure and turn back to previous pages at our will. In\nshort, the history of the progress from script to print is a history of the\ngradual substitution of visual for auditory methods of communicating and\nreceiving ideas.” ([p. 4](ch01.html#page_4)) Chaytor quotes ([p.\n7](ch01.html#page_7)) a passage from _Our Spoken Language_ by A. Lloyd James\n([p. 29](ch02.html#page_29)) which comes to grips with the alteration of our\nsense lives by way of literacy:\n\n“Sound and sight, speech and print, eye and ear have nothing in common. The\nhuman brain has done nothing that compares in complexity with this fusion of\nideas involved in linking up the two forms of language. But the result of the\nfusion is that once it is achieved in our early years, we are for ever after\nunable to think clearly, independently and surely about any one aspect of the\nmatter. We cannot think of sounds without thinking of letters; we believe\nletters have sounds. We think that the printed page is a picture of what we\nsay, and that the mysterious thing called ‘spelling’ is sacred. … The\ninvention of printing broadcast the printed language and gave to print a\ndegree of authority that it has never lost.”\n\nStressing the latent kinesthetic effects even in silent reading Chaytor refers\nto the fact that “some doctors forbid patients with severe throat affections\nto read, because silent reading provokes motions of the vocal organs, though\nthe reader may not be conscious of them.” He also considers ([p.\n6](ch01.html#page_6)) the interplay that is between the auditory and the\nvisual in reading:\n\nSo also when we speak or write, ideas evoke acoustic combined with kinesthetic\nimages, which are at once transformed into visual word images. The speaker or\nwriter can now hardly conceive of language, except in printed or written form;\nthe reflex actions by which the process of reading or writing is performed\nhave become so “instinctive” and are performed with such facile rapidity, that\nthe change from the auditory to the visual is concealed from the reader or\nwriter, and makes analysis of it a matter of great difficulty. It may be that\nacoustic and kinesthetic images are inseparable, and that “image” as such is\nan abstraction made for purposes of analysis, but which is non-existent\nconsidered in itself and as pure. But whatever account the individual may\nrender of his own mental processes, and most of us are far from competent in\nthis respect, the fact remains that his idea of language is irrevocably\nmodified by his experience of printed matter.\n\nThe alternating of modes or ratios between habitual patterns of sight and\nsound experience creates a large gap between the mental processes of the\nmedieval and the modern reader. Chaytor writes ([p. 10](ch01.html#page_10)):\n\nNothing is more alien to medievalism than the modern reader, skimming the\nheadlines of a newspaper and glancing down its columns to glean any point of\ninterest, racing through the pages of some dissertation to discover whether it\nis worth his more careful consideration, and pausing to gather the argument of\na page in a few swift glances. Nor is anything more alien to modernity than\nthe capacious medieval memory which, untrammelled by the associations of\nprint, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child,\nand could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric\npoems. Two points, therefore, must be emphasized at the outset. The medieval\nreader, with few exceptions, did not read as we do; he was in the stage of our\nmuttering childhood learner; each word was for him a separate entity and at\ntimes a problem which he whispered to himself when he had found the solution;\nthis fact is a matter of interest to those who edit the writings which he\nproduced. Further, as readers were few and hearers numerous, literature in its\nearly days was produced very largely for public recitation; hence, it was\nrhetorical rather than literary in character, and rules of rhetoric governed\nits composition.\n\nAs the present book was going to press, the observations of Dom Jean Leclercq\nconcerning reading aloud in the patristic and medieval period came most\nopportunely to attention. His _The Love of Learning and the Desire for God_\n([pp. 18](ch02.html#page_18)–19) puts this neglected matter in the central\nposition in which it belongs:\n\nIf then it is necessary to know how to read, it is primarily in order to be\nable to participate in the _lectio divina_. What does this consist of? How is\nthis reading done? To understand this, one must recall the meaning that the\nwords _legere_ and _meditari_ have for St. Benedict, and which they are to\nkeep throughout the whole of the Middle Ages; what they express will explain\none of the characteristic features of monastic literature of the Middle Ages:\nthe phenomenon of reminiscence, of which more must be said later. With regard\nto literature, a fundamental observation must be made here; in the Middle\nAges, as in antiquity, they read usually, not as today, principally with the\neyes, but with the lips, pronouncing what they saw, and with the ears,\nlistening to the words pronounced, hearing what is called the “voices of the\npages.” It is a real acoustical reading; _legere_ means at the same time\n_audire_ ; one understands only what one hears, as we still say: “entendre le\nlatin,” which means to “comprehend” it. No doubt, silent reading, or reading\nin a low voice, was not unknown; in that case it is designated by expressions\nlike those of St. Benedict: _tacite legere_ or _legere sibi_ , and according\nto St. Augustine: _legere in silentio_, as opposed to the _clara lectio_. But\nmost frequently, when _legere_ and _lectio_ are used without further\nexplanation, they mean an activity which, like chant and writing, requires the\nparticipation of the whole body and the whole mind. Doctors of ancient times\nused to recommend reading to their patients as a physical exercise on an equal\nlevel with walking, running or ball-playing. The fact that the text which was\nbeing composed or copied was often written to dictation given aloud, either to\noneself or to a secretary, satisfactorily explains the errors apparently due\nto hearing in medieval manuscripts: the use of the dictaphone today produces\nsimilar mistakes.\n\nFurther on ([p. 90](ch02.html#page_90)), Leclercq discusses the ways in which\nthe inevitable action of reading aloud entered into the whole conception of\nmeditation, prayer, study, and memory:\n\nThis results in more than a visual memory of the written words. What results\nis a muscular memory of the words pronounced and an aural memory of the words\nheard. The _meditatio_ consists in applying oneself with attention to this\nexercise in total memorization; it is, therefore, inseparable from the\n_lectio_. It is what inscribes, so to speak, the sacred text in the body and\nin the soul.\n\nThis repeated mastication of the divine words is sometimes described by use of\nthe theme of spiritual nutrition. In this case the vocabulary is borrowed from\neating, from digestion, and from the particular form of digestion belonging to\nruminants. For this reason, reading and meditation are sometimes described by\nthe very expressive word _ruminatio_. For example, in praising a monk who\nprayed constantly Peter the Venerable cried: “Without resting, his mouth\nruminated the sacred words.” Of John of Gorze it was claimed that the murmur\nof his lips pronouncing the Psalms resembled the buzzing of a bee. To meditate\nis to attach oneself closely to the sentence being recited and weigh all its\nwords in order to sound the depths of their full meaning. It means\nassimilating the content of a text by means of a kind of mastication which\nreleases its full flavor. It means, as St. Augustine, St. Gregory, John of\nFécamp and others say in an untranslatable expression, to taste it with the\n_palatum cordis_ or in _ore cordis_. All this activity is, necessarily, a\nprayer; the _lectio divina_ is a prayerful reading. Thus, the Cistercian,\nArnoul of Bohériss, will give this advice:\n\nWhen he reads, let him seek for savor, not science. The Holy Scripture is the\nwell of Jacob from which the waters are drawn which will be poured out later\nin prayer. Thus there will be no need to go to the oratory to begin to pray;\nbut in reading itself, means will be found for prayer and contemplation.\n\nNot only did this oral aspect of manuscript culture deeply affect the manner\nof composing and writing, but it meant that writing, reading, and oratory\nremained inseparable until well after printing.\n\n### The traditional lore of school children points to the gap between the\nscribal and typographic man.\n\nThe difference between the man of print and the man of scribal culture is\nnearly as great as that between the non-literate and the literate. The\ncomponents of Gutenberg technology were not new. But when brought together in\nthe fifteenth century there was an acceleration of social and personal action\ntantamount to “take off” in the sense that W. W. Rostow develops this concept\nin _The Stages of Economic Growth_ “that decisive interval in the history of a\nsociety when growth becomes its normal condition.”\n\nIn his _Golden Bough_ (vol. I, [p. xii](fm01.html#page_xii)), James Frazer\npoints to the similar acceleration introduced into the oral world by literacy\nand visuality:\n\nCompared with the evidence afforded by living tradition, the testimony of\nancient books on the subject of early religion is worth very little. For\nliterature accelerates the advance of thought at a rate which leaves the slow\nprogress of opinion by word of mouth at an immeasurable distance behind. Two\nor three generations of literature may do more to change thought than two or\nthree thousand years of traditional life. … and so it has come about that in\nEurope at the present day the superstitious beliefs and practices that have\nbeen handed down by word of mouth are generally of a far more archaic type\nthan the religion depicted in the most ancient literature of the Aryan race …\n\nJust how this comes about is the theme of Iona and Peter Opie in their _Lore\nand Language of Schoolchildren_ ([pp. 1](ch01.html#page_1)–2):\n\nWhile a nursery rhyme passes from a mother or other adult to the small child\non her knee, the school rhyme circulates simply from child to child, usually\noutside the home, and beyond the influence of the family circle. By its nature\na nursery rhyme is a jingle preserved and propagated not by children but by\nadults, and in this sense it is an “adult” rhyme. It is a rhyme which is adult\napproved. The schoolchild’s verses are not intended for adult ears. In fact\npart of their fun is the thought, usually correct, that adults know nothing\nabout them. Grown-ups have outgrown the schoolchild’s lore. If made aware of\nit they tend to deride it; and they actively seek to suppress its livelier\nmanifestations. Certainly they do nothing to encourage it. And the folklorist\nand anthropologist can, without travelling a mile from his door, examine a\nthriving unself-conscious culture (the word “culture” is used here\ndeliberately) which is as unnoticed by the sophisticated world, and quite as\nlittle affected by it, as is the culture of some dwindling aboriginal tribe\nliving out its helpless existence in the hinterland of a native reserve.\nPerhaps, indeed, the subject is worthy of a more formidable study than is\naccorded it here. As Douglas Newton has pointed out: “The word-wide fraternity\nof children is the greatest of savage tribes, and the only one which shows no\nsign of dying out.”\n\nIn communities widely separated in space and time there is a continuity and\ntenacity of tradition quite unknown to written forms.\n\nNo matter how uncouth schoolchildren may outwardly appear, they remain\ntradition’s warmest friends. Like the savage, they are respecters, even\nvenerators, of custom; and in their self-contained community their basic lore\nand language seems scarcely to alter from generation to generation. Boys\ncontinue to crack jokes that Swift collected from his friends in Queen Anne’s\ntime; they play tricks which lads used to play on each other in the heyday of\nBeau Brummel; they ask riddles which were posed when Henry VIII was a boy.\nYoung girls continue to perform a magic feat (levitation) of which Pepys heard\ntell (“One of the strangest things I ever heard”): they hoard bus tickets and\nmilk-bottle tops in distant memory of a love-lorn girl held to ransom by a\ntyrannical father; they learn to cure warts (and are successful in curing\nthem) after the manner which Francis Bacon learnt when he was young. They call\nafter the tearful the same jeer Charles Lamb recollected: they cry “Halves!”\nfor something found as Stuart children were accustomed to do; and they rebuke\none of their number who seeks back a gift with a couplet used in Shakespeare’s\nday. They attempt, too, to learn their fortune from snails, nuts, and apple-\nparings – divinations which the poet Gay described nearly two and a half\ncenturies ago; they span wrists to know if someone loves them in the way that\nSouthey used at school to tell if a boy was a bastard; and when they confide\nto each other that the Lord’s Prayer said backwards will make Lucifer appear,\nthey are perpetuating a story which was gossip in Elizabethan times.\n\n### The\n\nmedieval monks’ reading carrell was indeed a singing booth.\n\nChaytor, in his _From Script to Print_ ([p. 19](ch02.html#page_19)), was the\nfirst to tackle the problem of the medieval monk’s carrell or reading-singing\nbooth:\n\nWhy this attempt to secure privacy in establishments where the inmates as a\nrule spent most of their time among their fellows? For the same reason that\nthe reading-room of the British Museum is not divided into sound-proof\ncompartments. The habit of silent reading has made such an arrangement\nunnecessary; but fill the reading-room with medieval readers and the buzz of\nwhispering and muttering would be intolerable.\n\nThese facts deserve greater attention from the editors of medieval texts. When\nthe eye of a modern copyist leaves the manuscript before him in order to\nwrite, he carries in his mind a visual reminiscence of what he has seen. What\nthe medieval scribe carried was an auditory memory, and probably in many\ncases, a memory of one word at a time.[22](ch02a_fn21.html#ch02a_fn21fn22)\n\nIt is almost uncanny that the modern telephone booth should also reflect\nanother aspect of the medieval book world, namely the chained work of\nreference. But in Russia, until recently quite oral, there are no phone books.\nYou memorize your information – which is even more medieval than the chained\nbook. But memorization presented little problem for the pre-print student, and\nmuch less for non-literate persons. Natives are often bewildered by their\nliterate teachers and ask: “Why do you write things down? Can’t you remember?”\n\nChaytor was the first to explain ([p. 116](ch02.html#page_116)) why print\nshould impair our memories so notably, and why the manuscript should not:\n\nOur memories have been impaired by print; we know that we need not “burden our\nmemories” with matter which we can find merely by taking a book from a shelf.\nWhen a large proportion of a population is illiterate and books are scarce,\nmemories are often tenacious to a degree outside modern European experience.\nIndian students are able to learn a text-book by heart and to reproduce it\nword for word in an examination room; sacred texts are preserved intact by\noral transmission alone. “It is said that if all the written and printed\ncopies of the Rigveda were lost, the text could be restored at once with\ncomplete accuracy.” This text is about as long as the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_\ncombined. Russian and Jugoslav oral poetry is recited by ministrels who show\ngreat powers both of memory and improvisation.\n\nBut the more fundamental reason for imperfect recall is that with print there\nis more complete separation of the visual sense from the audile-tactile. This\ninvolves the modern reader in total translation of sight into sound as he\n_looks_ at the page. Recall of material read by the eye then is confused by\nthe effort to recall it both visually and auditorially. People with “good\nmemories” are the ones with “photographic memories.” That is, they do not\ntranslate back and forth from eye to ear and do not have things “on the tip of\nthe tongue,” which is our state when we do not know whether to see or hear a\npast experience.\n\nBefore turning to the oral and auditory world of the Middle Ages in its\nerudite and artistic aspects, there are two passages, one from the earliest\nand one from the latest phases of the medieval world that indicate the\nordinary assumption that the act of reading was oral and even dramatic.\n\nThe first passage is from _The Rule of Saint Benedict_ , chap. 48: “After the\nsixth hour, having left the table let them rest on their beds in perfect\nsilence; or if anyone wishes to read by himself, let him read so as not to\ndisturb the others.”\n\nThe second passage is from a letter of St. Thomas More to Martin Dorp,\nreproving Dorp for his letters: “However I am certainly surprised if any\nperson should take it into his head to be so flattering as to extol such\nmatters even in your presence; and, as I began to say, I wish you could watch\nthrough a window and see the facial expression, the tone of voice, the emotion\nwith which those matters are read.”[23](ch02a_fn22.html#ch02a_fn22fn23)\n\n### In the chantry schools grammar served, above all, to establish oral\nfidelity.\n\nOnce it is understood that oral culture has many features of stability, quite\nnon-existent in a visually organized world, it is quite easy to enter the\nmedieval situation. It is also easier to grasp some of the basic changes in\ntwentieth century attitudes.\n\nI turn briefly now to an unusual book by Istuan\nHajnal[24](ch02a_fn22.html#ch02a_fn22fn24) about the teaching of writing in\nmedieval universities. I had opened this book in the expectation of finding,\nbetween the lines, as it were, evidence of the ancient and medieval practice\nof private reading aloud. I was not prepared to discover that “writing” to a\nmedieval student was not only profoundly oral but inseparable from what is now\ncalled oratory and what was then called _pronuntiatio_, which was and remained\nthe fifth major division of standard rhetorical study. Just why delivery or\n_pronuntiatio_ was taken so seriously in the ancient and medieval worlds, gets\nnew meaning from Hajnal’s work: “The art of writing was held in great esteem\nbecause they saw in it the proof of a solid oral training.”\n\nThe story of writing as oral training helps to explain the early age of entry\nto the medieval university. For the proper study of the development of writing\nwe must consider that the students began their course at the university at the\nage of twelve or fourteen. “In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the\nnecessity of knowing Latin grammar, as well as material obstacles like the\nrarity of parchment, could push back the age at which writing might acquire\nits definitive form.”\n\nWe have to keep in mind that there was no organized system of education\noutside the universities. So that after the Renaissance “we find frequent\nallusions to the fact at Paris in the small classes of certain colleges,\nteaching commenced with the alphabet.” We have, moreover, data on students in\nthe college who were under ten years of age. But, certainly, for the medieval\nuniversity we have to keep in mind that it “embraced all the levels of\ninstruction from the most elementary to the most advanced.” Specialism in our\nsense was unknown and all levels of instruction tended to be inclusive rather\nthan exclusive. Certainly this inclusive character applies to the art of\nwriting at this period; for writing implied all that to the ancient and\nmedieval world was _grammatica_ or _philologia_.\n\nAt the opening of the twelfth century, says Hajnal ([p.\n39](ch02.html#page_39)), there had been “for some centuries an important\nsystem of teaching designed to train advanced students. This training included\nin addition to knowledge of the liturgy, practical skills associated with it.\nAt the level of the choir or chantry school one learned to read Latin and thus\ngrammar was necessary in order to recite and to copy properly the Latin texts.\nGrammar served above all to insure oral fidelity.”\n\nThis stress on oral fidelity was to the medieval man the equivalent of our own\nvisual idea of scholarship as involving exact quotation and proofreading. But\nthe reason for this state of affairs Hajnal clears up in his section on\n“methods of teaching writing at the university.”\n\nBy the middle of the thirteenth century the Faculty of Arts at Paris was at a\ncrossroads as regards methods. Presumably, the growing volume of available\nbooks had made it possible for many teachers to forego the method of the\n_dictamen_ or dictation, and to move at a fast pace. But the slow method of\ndictation was also still in vogue. According to Hajnal ([pp.\n64](ch02.html#page_64)–5), “after careful consideration, [the Faculty] decided\nin favour of the first method; that the professor should speak fast enough to\nbe understood, but too fast for the pen to follow him. … Students who in order\nto oppose this statute themselves, or by means of their servants and\nfollowers, should shout or whistle or stamp their feet would be excluded from\nthe Faculty for one year.”\n\n### The medieval student had to be paleographer, editor, and publisher of the\nauthors\n\nhe read.\n\nThe clash was between the old form of dictation or the new form of dialogue\nand oral disputation. And it was this clash which enables us to learn about\nthe details of medieval teaching procedure. On [pages 65](ch02.html#page_65)\nand [66](ch02.html#page_66) of Hajnal’s work we learn:\n\nThe mention that courses were conducted without dictation outside the Arts\nFaculty shows that the Arts Faculty had broken with the method in use in its\ncourses till that time. And what is more striking the Faculty of Arts expected\nthe opposition of the students … The students clung to dictation. For\ndictation up to that time served not only to slow down the lecture, it served\nnot only to give students complementary texts, but it constituted the method\nof the principal courses: _modus legendi libros_. … Dictation was in use even\nin the lectures given by the candidates at their examinations when they had to\noffer evidence of reading the written texts.\n\nHajnal proceeds to another basic aspect:\n\nThere can be no doubt that one of the essential reasons for the custom of\ndictation finds its explanation in the fact that, before the era of printing,\nschools and scholars had no adequate supply of texts. A manuscript book cost\nmuch; the simplest way of getting them was for the teacher to dictate the\ntexts to his pupils. It is possible that there were students who wrote by\ndictation texts for commercial ends. Yes, in a certain degree, dictation would\nhave been a commercial affair, both on the part of the student who wrote and\nsold the book and on the part of the teacher who by this means was assured of\na large audience, and, by the same token, substantial revenue. The manual was\nnecessary to the student, not only so far as it served for his university\ncourses, but also because it would be useful in his future career. … Moreover\nthe university required that students present themselves at their courses\nfurnished with books they had made, and if not that at least there be a book\nshared among every three students. … Finally, in presenting himself for his\ncandidature for a degree, the candidate was required to present the books\nwhich belonged to him. In the liberal careers, it was the corps of the\nprofession in question that examined the candidates for a post in order to see\nin what measure they were furnished with\nbooks.[25](ch02a_fn23.html#ch02a_fn23fn25)\n\nThe separation of words and music by the print technology was no more decisive\nthan its separation of visual and oral reading. Moreover, until printing the\nreader or consumer was literally involved as producer. Hajnal describes ([p.\n68](ch02.html#page_68)) how:\n\nThe method of “la dictee” _(dictamen_ , dictation) in medieval schools had\nbeyond doubt the goal of producing a definitive written text, usable on the\nspot, suitable to be read by anybody, and being eligible for commercial sale\nshould the occasion arise. The one dictating said the words not once or twice\nbut several times. Indeed, even after the banning of dictation courses it was\npermitted that the teacher dictate certain theses to be retained …\n\nQuite distinct from the precise and thorough mode of dictation in the Arts\ncourses called _modus pronuntiantium_ , there was: “a special form of\ndictation that followed the _modus pronuntiantium_ ; there was this other\nmethod of doing a course, speaking in a speedier fashion, a method destined\nfor the use of the _reportateurs_ , advanced students, who were able to teach\nthe others on the basis of notes they had taken.”\n\nBut the slow and precise mode of _dictamen_ or dictation was not only aimed at\nthe production of usable private editions, as it were:\n\n… in taking the course in this manner, they took into account the skimpy\npreparation of the students. … It is clear that the students followed these\ncourses not only to procure texts but also because they were obliged to learn\nthe texts in the process of writing them correctly and legibly. …\n\nThe expression _modus pronuntiantium_ was not used in the statutes simply to\ndesignate a course procedure of speaking aloud and duly articulating the\nwords. It was a technical term. The teaching of _pronuntiatio_ was one of the\nfundamental tasks of Latin _grammatica;_ and the manuals of grammar devoted a\ngood deal of detail to this question. It was an accepted and established\nmethod whose aim was to inculcate good pronunciation of spoken Latin, to teach\nthe careful distinction of the letters, to separate and modulate words and\nphrases. Manuals of grammar took care to say clearly that all this training\nserved the ends of teaching writing. At this time, good pronunciation was\nconsidered essential. It was indeed essential at that time and was the\nprerequisite for the teaching of writing. The act of writing silently without\nintervention of the reading the text aloud, was not yet possible at that\nperiod. The beginner did not yet see around him a world strewn with writings\nand printed texts. He needed clear and disciplined pronunciation of the text\nif he would learn to write without faults. ([p. 69](ch02.html#page_69))\n\nA fringe benefit of the need for reading and writing aloud is noted by Hajnal\n([pp. 75](ch02.html#page_75)–6):\n\nWriting in the mode of dictation did not constitute a copying exercise as\nsimple as might at first appear. It is a curious fact but it is precisely\nowing to this system that studies had been able to revive and a new literature\nwas born in the heart of these Faculties. For every professor strove to give\nto the matter taught a new form suited to its own assumptions and inherent\nconceptions; and mostly he dictated to his students the results of these\npersonal insights. That is how the university movement, from its inception,\nappears to us now as really modern.\n\n### Aquinas explains\n\nwhy Socrates, Christ, and Pythagoras avoided the publication of their\nteachings.\n\nHajnal then notes ([p. 76](ch02.html#page_76)) an aspect of personal book\nmaking that gives needed insight into a characteristic mode of manuscript\nculture. Not only did it foster minute textual attention, meditation in depth,\nand much memorization:\n\nThe old traditional manuals, mostly stemming from late antiquity, were always\nto hand for the professors, but they could see little point in recopying them\nad infinitum. To learn and to teach every day, individual by individual,\nadjusting the work to the preparation of each, they proceeded to condense and\nto simplify the matter taught in order to facilitate its study and to present\nit in a compact form.\n\nSumming up, Hajnal says the teaching of writing\n\nwas a method of teaching that had multiple objectives: the scribal training,\npractice in composition, and at the same time the introduction of minds to\nawareness of new concepts and reasonings and their means of expression. It was\na vital and steady movement, adding the pleasure of the practice and use of\nwriting to the acquisition of the texts themselves. This was perhaps the\noriginal cause that university teaching in the Middle Ages was more and more\ncharacterized by the practice of writing. It is not strange that from the\nfourteenth century the practice of writing was considered as constituting the\nessence of university life at Paris.\n\nIt is in the light of Hajnal’s presentation of medieval writing that we can\nmake more sense of the view of Aquinas that Socrates and Christ, being\nteachers, did not connect their teachings to writing. It is in question 42 of\nthe third part of the _Summa Theologica_ (that is, textbook of theology) that\nAquinas asks: “Utrum Christus debuerit doctrinam Suam Scripto tradere?”\nAquinas rejects the idea of the learner as a page that is to be written on – a\n_tabula rasa._ He says:\n\nI answer by saying that it is fitting that Christ did not commit his teaching\nto writing. First on account of his own dignity; for the more excellent the\nteacher, the more excellent his manner of teaching ought to be. And therefore\nit was fitting that Christ, as the most excellent of teachers, should adopt\nthat manner of teaching whereby his doctrine would be imprinted on the hearts\nof his hearers. For which reason it is said in Matthew vii, 29, that “he was\nteaching them as one having power.” For which reason even among the pagans\nPythagoras and Socrates, who were most excellent teachers, did not want to\nwrite anything.\n\nHad not medieval writing itself been so near to the oral mode of teaching the\nidea of the written form as merely a gimmick and not teaching, would not have\nbeen plausible.\n\nWith the splendid introduction that Hajnal provides for a unified approach to\nthe teaching medieval writing as a branch of rhetoric, and as co-extensive\nwith grammar and literary training, it is easy to tie the matter in for both\nearlier and later phases of studies. For example, in the _De oratore_ (I, xvi)\nCicero says that the poet is the rival and almost the equal of the orator.\nThat poetry or _grammatica_ is the handmaid of rhetoric is a commonplace in\nQuintilian, Augustine, and throughout the Middle Ages and the\nRenaissance.[26](ch02a_fn24.html#ch02a_fn24fn26)\n\nThe Ciceronian concept of _doctus orator_ and of eloquence as a kind of\nwisdom, as knowledge in action, became the basic charter of medieval education\nthanks to Augustine. But Augustine, an eminent professor of rhetoric, did not\ndeliver this Ciceronian charter to the Middle Ages as a speech program for\npulpit oratory. As Marrou states the matter in his great\nstudy,[27](ch02a_fn24.html#ch02a_fn24fn27) “la culture chrétienne,\naugustinienne, emprunte moins à la technique du rheteur qu’à celle du\ngrammairien.” In a word, ancient _grammatica_ and _philologia_ were\nencyclopedic, linguistically oriented programs which Augustine took over for\nthe Doctrina Christiana. It was not so much preaching as the understanding and\nexpounding of the _sacra pagina_ for which Augustine co-opted the world of\n_grammatica._ And just as Hajnal has shown how mere writing and the teaching\nof grammar could be completely one with the art of _pronuntiatio_ or\noratorical delivery,[28](ch02a_fn25.html#ch02a_fn25fn28) so Marrou shows how\nit could happen that ancient _grammatica_ became the basis for the study of\nthe Bible in the Middle Ages. We shall see how in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries the ancient and medieval techniques of exegesis\nflourished as never before. They became the basis for the Baconian scientific\nprogram and were thoroughly sidetracked by the new mathematics and the new\ntechniques of quantification.\n\nA brief look at the changes in the various methods of medieval exegesis will\nprepare the reader for some of the later effects of printing on the arts and\nsciences. Beryl Smalley’s _Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages_ is an\nadmirable survey entirely suited to this purpose. For knowing the “take-off”\nor new dimensions for visual experience and organization which began shortly\nafter printing, it is interesting to observe how much this visual stress was\nanticipated in a variety of areas quite unrelated to Gutenberg technology. The\nlook we have just taken at the ways in which ancient _grammatica_ persisted in\noral relation to medieval writing and textual study, helps to show how little\nthe manuscript culture was designed to intensify the visual faculty to the\npoint of splitting it away from the other senses.\n\nSmalley observes (p. xiv): “Teachers in the middle ages regarded the Bible as\na school book par excellence. The little clerk learned his letters from the\nPsalter, and the Bible would be used in teaching him the liberal arts. Hence\nBible study is linked with the history of institutions from the very\nbeginning. “\n\n### The rise of the schoolmen or **MODERNI** in the twelfth century made a\nsharp break with the **ANCIENTS** of traditional Christian scholarship.\n\nWe have seen how Marrou had shown that, thanks to Augustine, Bible study\nincorporated the ancient _egkuklios paideia_ or encyclopedic program of\n_grammatica_ and _rhetorica_ as it reached definition at the hands of Cicero.\nThus it was scriptural exegesis that ensured the continuity of classical\nhumanism in the monastic schools from Augustine to Erasmus. But the rise of\nthe universities in the twelfth century constituted a radical break with the\nclassical tradition. The program of the new universities was much centred in\n_dialectica_ or scholastic method which had had a heyday at Rome as we read in\nS. F. Bonner’s _Roman Declamation_ ([p. 43](ch02.html#page_43)):\n\nUnder the Republic, oratory had been essential for success in public life, and\nthe whole subject was alive and keenly debated; but under the principate it\nhad lost much of its political value. It was not so much that the courts had\nlost a great deal of their power; there were still civil and criminal cases to\nattract the advocate. It was rather the lack of assured success in public\nlife, which the good orator in Republican days could naturally expect. Under\nthe principate, so much depended upon Imperial and Court patronage; and it\nbecame necessary to choose one’s words rather too carefully when speaking in\npublic for the practice to be a popular one. Writing under Tiberius (if not\nCaligula) the elder Seneca could look back upon the Augustan Age as a time\nwhen there was “so much liberty of speech”; but even then that freedom which\nthe author of the _Dialogues_ and the philosopher in _Longinus_ consider so\nessential for good oratory, was fast disappearing from Roman public life.\n\nAnd so oratory betook itself to the safer arena of the schools, where a man\nmight air his Republicanism without fear of consequences, and where one might\nbe recompensed for the loss of political prestige by the plaudits of one’s\nfellow-citizens. The term _scholastica_ came into vogue – a “school-oration”\nas opposed to the genuine public speech, and the exponents of these display-\nspeeches became known as “ _schoolmen_ ” – _scholastici._\n\nThe break between political oratory and scholastic or academic disputation,\nthen, took place long before the Middle Ages. Bonner refers to the\n_Controversiae_ of the elder Seneca and notes ([p. 2](ch01.html#page_2)):\n“From this it appears that Seneca recognized three main stages of development:\n(i) the pre-Ciceronian _thesis_ (ii) the privately rehearsed declamations of\nCicero and his contemporaries, known to them as _causae_ (iii) the declamation\nproper, known as _controversia_ and subsequently also as _scholastica._ ”\n\nThese scholastic exercises in ancient Rome depended on the _sic et non_\nexamination of theses. And in his _Topics_ (1, 9) Aristotle refers to such\ntheses as an assertion or negation of some exceptional philosophical tenet,\ngiving as examples “that everything is in a state of flux” or “that all\nexistence is One.”\n\nMoreover, “thesis” meant that the topic might not only be paradoxical but that\nit would be considered in abstraction from particular circumstances and from\n“given person place or time.” Bonner adds ([p. 3](ch01.html#page_3)):\n\nIt is in the _Rhetorica_ of Cicero, the _Institutio Oratoria_ of Quintilian,\nand the later Greek and Roman rhetoricians, that specific examples of subjects\nof _theses_ are found. They represent the major problems of the world and its\nmeaning, of human life and conduct, which the Greeks debated through the ages,\nfrom the cities of Asia Minor to the groves of the Academy, from the Garden\nand the Porch to the villas of Italy and the colonnades of Rome.\n\nThe reason for bringing up the character of scholastic form is that from the\ntwelfth to the sixteenth centuries this kind of highly oral activity broke\naway from the _grammatica_ that formed the base of monastic and later humanist\nprocedures. For _grammatica_ is concerned very much with particular historical\ncircumstances and with given person, place and time. With the advent of the\nprinted book _grammatica_ surged back to a dominance it had enjoyed before\nscholasticism and the _moderni_ and the new universities had swept it aside.\nScholasticism in ancient Rome was also an oral affair, and Bonner points out\nCicero’s letter to Atticus in which Cicero mentions a list of theses which he\nhimself declaimed in private:\n\nThey are almost exclusively concerned with the subject of tyrants and tyranny\n– “Should one work for the tyrant’s downfall, even though it may jeopardise\nthe State, or merely prevent his overthrower’s elevation?” … “Should one\nattempt to help one’s country, when subject to a tyrant, by opportune speech\nrather than by force of arms?” There are eight such subjects, which Cicero\nsays he declaimed in Greek and Latin, both for and against, in order to take\nhis mind off his present troubles …[29](ch02a_fn26.html#ch02a_fn26fn29)\n\n### Scholasticism, like Senecanism, was directly related to the oral\ntraditions of aphoristic learning.\n\nWhen it is understood how entirely oral these thesis defenses were, it is\neasier to see why the students of such arts would need to have memories\nfurnished with a large repertory of aphorisms and _sententiae_. This is a\nfactor in the prevalence of Senecan stylistic in later Roman times and for the\nlong association of Senecan style with “scientific method” both in the middle\nages and in the Renaissance. For Francis Bacon, as much as for Abelard,\n“writing in aphorisms” rather than in “methods” was the difference between\nkeen analysis and mere public persuasion.\n\nIn _The Advancement of Learning_ , which is itself shaped as a public oration,\nBacon prefers, on intellectual grounds, the scholastic technique of aphorism\nto the Ciceronian method of explicit spelling out of information in the form\nof continuous prose:\n\nAnother diversity of Method, whereof the consequence is great, is the delivery\nof knowledge in Aphorisms, or in Methods; wherein we may observe that it hath\nbeen too much taken into custom, out of a few axioms or observations upon any\nsubject, to make a solemn and formal art, filling it with some discourses, and\nillustrating it with examples, and digesting it into a sensible Method.\n\nBut the writing in aphorisms hath many excellent virtues, whereto the writing\nin Method doth not approach. For first, it trieth the writer, whether he be\nsuperficial or solid: for Aphorisms, except they should be rediculous, cannot\nbe made but of the pith and heart of sciences; for discourse of illustration\nis cut off: recitals of examples are cut off; discourse of connection and\norder is cut off; descriptions of practice are cut off. So there remaineth\nnothing to fill the Aphorisms but some good quantity of observation: and\ntherefore no man can suffice, nor in reason will attempt to write Aphorisms,\nbut he that is sound and grounded. But in Methods,\n\nTantum series juncturaque pollet,  \nTantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris;\n\nas a man shall make a great shew of an art, which, if it were disjointed,\nwould come to little. Secondly, methods are more fit to win consent or belief,\nbut less fit to point to action; for they carry a kind of demonstration in orb\nor circle, one part illuminating another, and therefore satisfy; but\nparticulars, being dispersed, do best agree with dispersed directions. And\nlastly, Aphorisms, representing a knowledge broken, do invite men to inquire\nfarther; whereas Methods, carrying the show of a total, do secure men, as if\nthey were at farthest. ([p. 142](ch02a.html#page_142))\n\nWe find it hard to grasp that the Senecan Francis Bacon was in many respects a\nschoolman. Later, it will appear that his own “method” in science was straight\nout of medieval _grammatica_.\n\nNoting that the Roman scholastics or declaimers used sensational themes (such\nas the Senecan drama used in Roman and Renaissance times alike), Bonner adds\n(_Roman Declamation_ , [p. 65](ch02.html#page_65)):\n\nBut apart from these characteristics their diction is much the same as that of\ncontemporary writers, and is typical of the earliest “Silver Latin.”\n\nIn composition, the chief faults are the excessive use of short and disjointed\nsentences, giving an abrupt effect to the style, the rarity of well-balanced\nperiods, and the use by some declaimers of weak and ineffective rhythms. The\nstyle of these extracts is what the Greek critics would have called\n_κατακεκομμ ένη_ or _κεκερματισμ ένη_ as an antidote to periodic structure,\nthis feature would have been most effective, but it is so frequently used that\nthe mind wearies of the repeated pungency and point.\n\nBut the “disjointed sentences” and endless alliterations such as Augustine\nused for his popular “rhymed sermons” are the necessary norm of oral prose and\npoetry alike. (Witness the Elizabethan _Euphues_.) It is easy to gauge the\ndegree of acceptance of print culture in any time or country by its effect in\neliminating pun, point, alliteration, and aphorism from literature. Thus, the\nLatin countries even today retain maxims, _sententiae_ , and aphorism at a\nrespectable level. And the _symboliste_ revival of oral culture not only began\nfirst in Latin countries but relied much on “disjointed sentences” and\naphorism. Seneca and Quintilian, like Lorca and Picasso, were Spaniards for\nwhom auditory modes were of great authority. Bonner ([p.\n71](ch02.html#page_71)) is puzzled by the favourable light in which Quintilian\nsets the Euphuistic devices of Latin eloquence in spite of being\n“distinguished by his commonsense and liberal educational outlook.”\n\nEven this brief attention to Senecanism and scholasticism in ancient Rome will\nhelp to understand how oral tradition in Western literature is transmitted by\nthe Senecan vogue, and was gradually obliterated by the printed page in the\nlater eighteenth century. The paradox that Senecanism is both highbrow in\nmedieval scholasticism and lowbrow in the Elizabethan popular drama will be\nfound to be resolved by this oral factor. But for Montaigne, as for Burton,\nBacon, and Browne, there was no enigma. Senecan antithesis and “amble” (as\ndescribed in _Senecan Amble_ by George Williamson) provided the authentic\nmeans of scientific observation and experience of mental process. When only\nthe eye is engaged, the multi-levelled gestures and resonances of Senecan oral\naction are quite impertinent.\n\nOnly two more items in this part of our mosaic of _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ are\nneeded. One of them is timeless, and the other is right on the focal point of\nthe sixteenth century metamorphosis _via_ print. First, then, the matter of\nthe proverb, the maxim, the aphorism, as an indispensable mode of oral\nsociety. Chapter 18 of J. Huizinga’s _The Waning of the Middle Ages_ is\ndevoted to this theme of how in an oral society, ancient or modern,\n\n… every event, every case, fictitious or historic, tends to crystallize, to\nbecome a parable, an example, a proof, in order to be applied as a standing\ninstance of a general moral truth. In the same way every utterance becomes a\ndictum, a maxim, a text. For every question of conduct Scripture, legends,\nhistory, literature, furnish a crowd of examples or of types, together making\nup a sort of moral clan, to which the matter in question belongs. (p.227)\n\nHuizinga sees clearly that even written materials are strongly urged into the\noral pattern of proverb and aphorism and exemplum or instance, by the oral\nform of discourse. That is why: “In the Middle Ages everyone liked to base a\nserious argument on a text, so as to give it a foundation.” But the “text” was\nfelt to be the immediate voice of an _auctor_ , and was authoritative in an\noral way. We shall see that with the advent of printing the feeling for\nauthority is completely confused by the intermingling of the old oral and the\nnew visual organization of knowledge.\n\nThe second point concerning the oral bias towards _Sentences_ and aphorisms,\nas both compressed and authoritative, is that this preference is rapidly\naltered in the sixteenth century. Walter Ong has devoted a great deal of\nattention to this change as it appears in the work and vogue of Peter Ramus.\nSaving Father Ong’s important work for attention a little later, it is only\nnecessary to cite here his article on “Ramist Method and the Commercial\nMind.”[30](ch02a_fn27.html#ch02a_fn27fn30) Ong stresses the change in human\nsensibility resulting from the rise of typography, showing “how the use of\nprinting moved the word away from its original association with sound and\ntreated it more as a ‘thing’ in space.”\n\nThe implication of this visual approach for the oral aphorism, and for the\ncompendia of sentences, adages, and maxims which had been the medieval staple\nof learning, was recession. As Ong puts it ([p. 160](ch02a.html#page_160)), “\n… Ramus tends to regard the knowledge which he purveys in his arts as a\ncommodity rather than as a wisdom.” The printed book will naturally tend to\nbecome a work of reference rather than a speaking wisdom.\n\n### Scribal culture and Gothic architecture were both concerned with light\n**THROUGH** , not light **ON**.\n\nThe scholastic deviation from the monastic literary humanism was soon to be\nconfronted by the flood of ancient texts from the printing presses. Four\ncenturies of dialectical intensity seemed to end there; but the spirit and\nachievement of scholastic science and abstraction was carried along, as men\nlike Clagett have shown, into the full tide of modern science.\n\nThe scholastic discovery of visual means of graphing non-visual relationships\nof force and motion is quite at variance with the textual positivism of the\nhumanist. Yet both humanist and the schoolman have been justly nominated for\nscientific honours. This natural confusion we shall see reaching explicit\nconflict in the mind of Francis Bacon. His own confusion will help to clarify\nmany issues for us a little later on.\n\nThe exegesis of the Bible had its own conflicts of method, and as Smalley\nindicates in her _Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages_ they concerned the\nletter and the spirit, the visual and the non-visual. She cites Origen:\n\nI published three books (on Genesis) from the sayings of the Holy Fathers\nconcerning the letter and the spirit … For the Word came into the world by\nMary, clad in flesh; and seeing was not understanding; all saw the flesh;\nknowledge of the divinity was given to a chosen few. … The letter appears as\nthe flesh; but the spiritual sense within is known as divinity. This is what\nwe find in studying Leviticus … Blessed are the eyes which see divine spirit\nthough the letters veil. ([p. 1](ch01.html#page_1))\n\n\nThe theme of the letter and the spirit, a dichotomy deriving from writing, was\nfrequently alluded to by Our Lord in his “It is written, but I say unto you.”\nThe prophets had usually been at war with the scribes in Israel. This theme\nenters into the very texture of medieval thought and sensibility, as in the\ntechnique of the “gloss” to release the light from within the text, the\ntechnique of the illumination as light _through_ not _on_ , and the very mode\nof Gothic architecture itself. As Otto von Simson states in _The Gothic\nCathedral_ ([pp. 3](ch01.html#page_3)–4):\n\nIn a Romanesque church, light is something distinct from and contrasting with\nthe heavy, somber, tactile substance of the walls. The Gothic wall seems to be\nporous: light filters through it, permeating it, merging with it,\ntransfiguring it. … Light, which is ordinarily concealed by matter, appears as\nthe active principle; and matter is aesthetically real only insofar as it\npartakes of, and is defined by, the luminous quality of light. … In this\ndecisive aspect, then, the Gothic may be described as transparent, diaphanous\narchitecture.\n\nThese effects of diaphanous stone are obtained by stained glass, but they are\nquite relevant to the medieval approach to the human senses and to the senses\nof scripture above all. It is interesting that Simson points out the tactile\nquality of stone. An oral manuscript culture had no fear of tactility, the\nvery crux of the interplay of the senses. For it was in this interplay that\nall lattice or sense _ratio_ was formed that let light through. The “literal”\nlevel which was thought to possess all the meanings was such an interplay. “We\nthen discover that what we should now call exegesis, which is based on a study\nof the text and of biblical history, in its widest sense, belongs to the\n‘literal exposition.’”\n\nIn _The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages_ , Smalley cites from\n_Carolingian Art_ by R. Hinks: “It is as though we were invited to focus our\neyes not on the physical surface of the object, but on infinity as seen\nthrough the lattice …; the object … exists – as it were – merely to define and\ndetach a certain portion of infinite space, and make it manageable and\napprehensible.” Smalley then comments ([p. 2](ch01.html#page_2)): “This\ndescription of ‘pierced technique’ in early northern art is also an exact\ndescription of exegesis as understood by Claudius … We are invited to look not\nat the text but through it.”\n\nProbably any medieval person would be puzzled at our idea of looking through\nsomething. He would assume that the reality looked through at us, and that by\ncontemplation we bathed in the divine light, rather than looked at it. The\nquite different sensuous assumptions of manuscript culture, ancient and\nmedieval, from anything since Gutenberg, obtrude from the ancient doctrine of\nthe senses and the _sensus communis_.[31](ch02a_fn28.html#ch02a_fn28fn31)\nErwin Panofsky in his study of _Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism_ also\nstresses the medieval bias for light through and found it helpful to tackle\nthe architectural problem _via_ the schoolmen:\n\n“Sacred doctrine,” says Thomas Aquinas, “makes use of human reason, not to\nprove faith but to make clear (_manifestare_) whatever else is set forth in\nthis doctrine.” This means that human reason can never hope to furnish direct\nproof of such articles of faith … but that it can, and does, elucidate or\nclarify these articles …\n\n_Manifestatio_ , then, elucidation or clarification, is what I would call the\nfirst controlling principle of Early and High Scholasticism … if faith had to\nbe “manifested” through a system of thought complete and self-sufficient\nwithin its own limits yet setting itself apart from the realm of revelation,\nit became necessary to “manifest” the completeness, self-sufficiency, and\nlimitedness of the system of thought. And this could be done only by a scheme\nof literary presentation that would elucidate the very processes of reasoning\nto the reader’s imagination just as reasoning was supposed to elucidate the\nvery nature of faith to his intellect. ([pp. 29](ch02.html#page_29)–31)\n\nPanofsky then notes ([p. 43](ch02.html#page_43)) the “principle of\ntransparency” in architecture: “It was, however, in architecture that the\nhabit of clarification achieved its greatest triumphs. As High Scholasticism\nwas governed by the principle of _manifestatio_ , so was High Gothic\narchitecture dominated – as already observed by Suger – by what may be called\nthe “principle of transparency.” Panofsky gives us ([p.\n38](ch02.html#page_38)) the medieval sense doctrine as stated by Aquinas: “The\nsenses delight in things duly proportioned _as in something akin to them; for,\nthe sense, too, is a kind of reason as is every cognitive power.”_ Armed with\nthis principle that there is a ratio or rationality in the senses themselves,\nPanofsky is able to move freely among the ratios that are between medieval\nscholasticism and medieval architecture. But this principle of ratio in the\nsenses as light through Being is everywhere in study of the senses of\nscripture as well. But all of these matters became much confused by the\ngrowing demand for light _on_ , rather than light _through_ , as the later\ntechnology set the visual faculty in ever sharper separation from the other\nsenses. The dilemma ahead is perfectly defined by Otto von Simson in _The\nGothic Cathedral_ ([p. 3](ch01.html#page_3)): “Not that Gothic interiors are\nparticularly bright … in fact, the stained-glass windows were such inadequate\nsources of light that a subsequent and blinder age replaced many of them by\ngrisaille or white windows that today convey a most misleading impression.”\n\nAfter Gutenberg the new visual intensity will require light _on_ everything.\nAnd its idea of space and time will change to regard them as containers to be\n_filled_ with objects or activities. But in a manuscript age when the visual\nstood in closer relation to the audile-tactile, space was not a visual\ncontainer. There was scarcely any furniture in a medieval room, as Siegfried\nGiedion explains in _Mechanization Takes Command_ ([p.\n301](ch03.html#page_301)):\n\nAnd yet there was a medieval comfort. But it must be sought in another\ndimension, for it cannot be measured on the material scale. The satisfaction\nand delight that were medieval comfort have their source in the configuration\nof space. Comfort is the atmosphere with which man surrounds himself and in\nwhich he lives. Like the medieval Kingdom of God, it is something that eludes\nthe grasp of hands. Medieval comfort is the comfort of space.\n\nA medieval room seems finished even when it contains no furniture. It is never\nbare. Whether a cathedral, refectory, or a burgher chamber, it lives in its\nproportions, its materials, its form. This sense for the dignity of space did\nnot end with the Middle Ages. It lasted until nineteenth-century industrialism\nblurred the feelings. Yet no later age so emphatically renounced bodily\ncomfort. The ascetic ways of monasticism invisibly shaped the period to its\nown image.\n\n### Medieval illumination, gloss, and sculpture alike were aspects of the art\nof memory, central to scribal culture.\n\nIn this lengthy consideration of the oral aspects of manuscript culture,\nwhether in the ancient or medieval phase, we gain this advantage: we shall not\nbe inclined to look here for literary qualities that were the later product of\nprint culture.\n\nMoreover, we begin to know what to expect of print technology in the\ndiminution of oral qualities. And today in the electronic age we can\nunderstand why there should be a great diminishing of the special qualities of\nprint culture, and a revival of oral and auditory values in verbal\norganization. For verbal organization, whether on the page or in speech, can\nhave a visual bias such as we associate with the clipped and rapid speech of\nhighly literate people. Again, verbal organization, even on the written page\ncan have an oral bias, as in the scholastic philosophy. The unconscious\nliterary bias of Rashdall is quite involuntary when he says in _The University\nof Europe in the Middle Ages_ (vol. II, [p. 37](ch02.html#page_37)): “The\nmysteries of logic were indeed intrinsically better calculated to fascinate\nthe intellect of the half-civilized barbarian than the elegancies of classical\npoetry and oratory.” But Rashdall is right in considering the oral man to be a\nbarbarian. For technically the “civilized” man is, whether crude or stupid, a\nman of strong visual bias in his entire culture, a bias derived from only one\nsource, the phonetic alphabet. It is the concern of this book to discover how\nfar the visual bias of this phonetic culture was pushed, first by the\nmanuscript, and then by typography, or “this mechanical kind of writing,” as\nit was early called. Scholastic philosophy was deeply oral in its procedures\nand organization, but so, in different ways, was scriptural exegesis. And the\ncenturies of study of the Bible in the Middle Ages that embraced both ancient\n_grammatica_ (or literature) also prepared the materials indispensable to\nscholastic dialectic techniques. Both _grammatica_ and _dialectica_ or\nscholastic philosophy were extremely oral in their orientation compared to the\nnew visual orientation fostered by print.\n\nA favourite nineteenth century theme was that the medieval cathedrals were the\n“books of the people.” Kurt Seligman’s statement of this aspect of the\ncathedral (_The History of Magic_ , pp. 415–16) serves to bring out their\nresemblance to the page of medieval scriptural commentary:\n\nIn this quality, the Tarot cards resemble the images of other arts: the\npaintings, sculpture, and stained glass windows of the cathedrals, which also\nclothed ideas in human form. Their world, however, is the one above, while the\nworld of the Tarot is below. The trumps depict the relation of the powers and\nthe virtues to man; the cathedrals on the other hand embody man’s relation to\nthe divine. But both images impress themselves upon the mind. They are\nmnemonic. They contain a wide complex of ideas that would fill volumes were\nthey written down. They can be “read” by the illiterate and the literate\nalike, and they are destined for both. The Middle Ages were concerned with\ntechniques that would enable man to remember and to compare many such areas of\nideas. Under this impulse, Raymond Lully wrote his _Ars Memoria_ , the Art of\nMemory. Similar preoccupations also resulted in the early block print, _Ars\nMemorandi_ , printed about 1470. The author undertook the difficult task of\nmaking concrete the themes contained in the Four Gospels. For each Gospel, he\ncreated a few images, angels, bulls, lions, and eagles, emblems of the four\nEvangelists, upon which he imposed objects that were to suggest the stories\ntreated in each chapter. Figure 231 shows the angel (Matthew), containing\neight smaller emblems that were to recall Matthew’s eight first chapters. In\nvisualizing every figure of _Ars Memorandi_ with all their emblems, one would\nremember the stories of the entire Gospel.\n\nTo us, such visual memory would seem prodigious, but it was surely not unusual\nin times when only a few could read and write, and when images played the role\nof writing.\n\nSeligman has here grasped another essential feature of oral culture, the\ntraining of the memory. Just as _pronuntiatio_ , the fifth division of\nclassical rhetoric, was cultivated, as Hajnal has shown, for the art of\nwriting and making books, so _memoria_ , the fourth division of ancient\noratory was a needful discipline in the manuscript age, and was served by the\nvery arts of gloss and marginal illumination. Smalley, indeed, records ([p.\n53](ch02.html#page_53)) that the marginal gloss, although of unknown origin,\nserved among its users “as notes for the delivery of oral _lecturae_.”\n\nIn an unpublished master’s thesis[32](ch02a_fn29.html#ch02a_fn29fn32) John H.\nHarrington observes that in the early Christian centuries “Both the book, and\nthe written word were identified with the message they carried. They were\nconsidered as being magically potent instruments, especially against the devil\nand his snares.” Harrington has many sections that bear on the oral character\nof “reading” and on the need for memorization as this from the rule of\nPachomius: “And if he be unwilling to read, he is to be forced, so that there\nwill never be one in a monastery who cannot read and memorize portions of\nSacred Scripture.” ([p. 34](ch02.html#page_34)) “Often while travelling two\nmonks would read to one another, or recite from memory the Book of Scripture.”\n([p. 48](ch02.html#page_48))\n\n### For the oral man the literal text contains all possible levels of meaning.\n\nIt will be useful now to notice a few more points in Smalley’s _Study of the\nBible in the Middle Ages_ , that indicate the steady development of new visual\nbias in later medieval study of the Bible.\n\nThere was the early scholastic drive to break away from literary contextual\nconstraints: “Drogo, Lanfranc, and Berengar use dialectic in order to tunnel\nunderneath their text; they attempt to reconstruct the logical process in the\nmind of their author. Dialectic could also be used for building up a new\ntheological structure with the text as a base.” ([p. 72](ch02.html#page_72)).\n\nTo get at this process, of disengagement from the literary context, had been\none of the attractions of the great collection of sentences of Peter Lombard,\nof the _Sic et Non_ of Abelard, and the concordances of Discordant Canons that\nwere great literary labours of this time: _“Quaestiones_ were not only\nexcerpted from their original commentary and issued separately; they were also\ntransferred to a different kind of work. … Hence we are faced with the\ndifficult problem of distinguishing between exegesis and systematic doctrinal\nteaching.” ([p. 75](ch02.html#page_75))\n\nThe _Adagia_ and _Similia_ of Erasmus, excerpted from every sort of work, were\nlater transferred into sermons, essays, plays, and sonnets in the sixteenth\ncentury. The real pressure towards visual schemes and organization came from\nthe mounting volume of matters to be processed:\n\nThis one-sided development was quite natural. The innumerable problems arising\nfrom the reception of Aristotelian logic and the study of canon and civil law,\nthe new possibilities of reasoning, the urgent need for speculation and\ndiscussion, all these produced an atmosphere of haste and excitement which was\nunfavourable to biblical scholarship. The masters of the cathedral schools had\nneither the time nor the training to specialize in a very technical branch of\nBible study. This applied to the philosophers and humanists of Chartres as\nmuch as to the theologians of Paris and Laon. Even Bec, the last of the great\nmonastic schools, had been no exception. Lanfranc was a theologian and\nlogician; the genius of his pupil, St. Anselm of Canterbury, took another\ndirection. His philosophical works eclipsed his biblical, which seem to have\nbeen lost. ([p. 77](ch02.html#page_77))\n\nAnd it was the same pressure of quantity that told, in the long run, in favour\nof typography. But the point where the visual and the oral approaches to\nscripture came into sharp medieval conflict was, as might have been predicted,\naxial or polar to the area where conflict occurred in the new visual culture\nof the Renaissance. Hugh of St. Victor conveys the matter clearly:\n\nThe mystical sense is only gathered from what the letter says, in the first\nplace. I wonder how people have the face to boast themselves teachers of\nallegory, when they do not know the primary meaning of the letter. “We read\nthe Scriptures”, they say, “but we don’t read the letter. The letter does not\ninterest us. We teach allegory.” How do you read Scripture then, if you don’t\nread the letter? Subtract the letter and what is left? “We _read_ the letter”\nthey say, “but not according to the letter. We read allegory, and we expound\nthe letter not literally but allegorically …; as _lion_ , according to the\nhistorical sense means a beast, but allegorically it means Christ. Therefore\nthe word _lion_ means Christ.” ([p. 93](ch02.html#page_93))\n\nTo the oral man the literal is inclusive, contains all possible meanings and\nlevels. So it was for Aquinas. But the visual man of the sixteenth century is\nimpelled to separate level from level, and function from function, in a\nprocess of specialist exclusion. The auditory field is simultaneous, the\nvisual mode is successive. Of course, the very notion of “levels of exegesis,”\nwhether literal, figurative, topological, or anagogic, is strongly visual, a\nclumsy sort of metaphor. Yet: “Living over a century before St. Thomas, Hugh\nseems to have grasped the Thomist principle that the clue to prophecy and\nmetaphor is the writer’s intention; the literal sense includes everything\nwhich the sacred writer meant to say. But he has occasional lapses from his\nown standard.” ([p. 101](ch02.html#page_101))\n\nThe Thomistic notion of the simultaneous interplay among the senses is as\nunvisualizable as analogical proportionality: “St. Thomas, perfecting the\ntentative efforts of his predecessors, has supplied a theory of the relations\nbetween the senses which lays the stress on the literal interpretation, now\ndefined as the full meaning of the author.” (p. 368)\n\n### The sheer increase in the quantity of information movement favoured the\nvisual organization of knowledge and the rise of perspective even before\ntypography.\n\nAs the literal or “the letter” later became identified with light _on_ rather\nthan light _through_ the text, there was also the equivalent stress on “point\nof view” or the _fixed_ position of the reader: “from where I am sitting.”\nSuch a visual stress was quite impossible before print stepped up the visual\nintensity of the written page to the point of entire uniformity and\nrepeatability. This uniformity and repeatability of typography, quite alien to\nmanuscript culture, is the necessary preliminary to unified or pictorial space\nand “perspective.” _Avant-garde_ painters like Masaccio in Italy and the Van\nEycks in the North began to experiment with pictorial or perspective space\nearly in the fifteenth century. And in 1435, a mere decade before typography,\nthe young Leone Battista Alberti wrote a treatise on painting and perspective\nwhich was to be the most influential of the age.\n\nThe other thing in Alberti’s book that marked the coming of a new attitude far\nremoved from that of the Greeks was his description of the earliest known\ngeometrical scheme for depicting objects in a unified space, or in other words\nwhat we today call perspective. Just as it was a major event in the history of\npictorial representation, so it was in the history of geometry, for in it was\nstated for the first time the now familiar process of central projection and\nsection, the subsequent development of which has been the outstanding feature\nof modern synthetic geometry. It is an idea that was unknown to the Greeks,\nand it was discovered at a time so ignorant of geometry that Alberti thought\nit necesary to explain the words diameter and\nperpendicular.[33](ch02a_fn30.html#ch02a_fn30fn33)\n\nIt is necessary for the understanding of the visual take-off that was to occur\nwith Gutenberg technology, to know that such a take-off had not been possible\nin the manuscript ages, for such a culture retains the audile-tactile modes of\nhuman sensibility in a degree incompatible with abstract visuality or the\ntranslation of all the senses into the language of unified, continuous,\npictorial space. That is why Ivins is entirely justified in maintaining in his\n_Art and Geometry_ ([p. 41](ch02.html#page_41)):\n\nPerspective is something quite different from foreshortening. Technically, it\nis the central projection of a three-dimensional space upon a plane.\nUntechnically, it is the way of making a picture on a flat surface in such a\nmanner that the various objects represented in it appear to have the same\nsizes, shapes, and positions, _relatively to each other_ , that the actual\nobjects as located in actual space would have if seen by the beholder from a\nsingle determined point of view. I have discovered nothing to justify the\nbelief that the Greeks had any idea, either in practice or theory, at any\ntime, of the conception contained in the italicised words in the preceding\nsentence.\n\nThe study of the Bible in the Middle Ages achieved conflicting patterns of\nexpression which the economic and social historian is also familiar with. The\nconflict was between those who said that the sacred text was a complex unified\nat the literal level, and those who felt that the levels of meaning should be\ntaken one at a time in a specialist spirit. This conflict between an auditory\nand a visual bias seldom reached a high degree of intensity until after\nmechanical and typographical technology had conferred on the visual great\npreponderance. Prior to this ascendancy, the relative equality among the\nsenses of sight, sound, touch, and movement in interplay in manuscript\nculture, had fostered the preference for light _through_ , whether in\nlanguage, art or architecture. Panofsky’s view in _Gothic Architecture and\nScholasticism_ ([pp. 58](ch02.html#page_58)–60) is:\n\nA man imbued with the scholastic habit would look upon the mode of\narchitectural presentation just as he looked upon the mode of literary\npresentation, from the point of view of _manifestatio._ He would have taken it\nfor granted that the primary purpose of the many elements that compose a\ncathedral was to ensure stability, just as he took it for granted that the\nprimary purpose of the many elements that constitute a _Summa_ was to ensure\nvalidity.\n\nBut he would not have been satisfied had not the membrification of the edifice\npermitted him to re-experience the very processes of cogitation. To him, the\npanoply of shafts, ribs, buttresses, tracery, pinnacles, and crockets was a\nself-analysis and self-explication of architecture much as the customary\napparatus of parts, distinctions, questions, and articles was, to him, a self-\nanalysis and self-explication of reason. Where the humanistic mind demanded a\nmaximum of “harmony” (impeccable diction in writing, impeccable proportion, so\nsorely missed in Gothic structures by Vasari, in architecture), the Scholastic\nmind demanded a maximum of explicitness. It accepted and insisted upon a\ngratuitous clarification of function through form just as it accepted and\ninsisted upon a gratuitous clarification of thought through language.\n\nThe student of medieval poetry could readily parallel these features. The\n_dolce stil nuovo_ of Dante and others was achieved, as Dante explains, by\nlooking within and following the very contours and process of passionate\nthought. It is in Canto XXIV of the _Purgatorio_ that Dante says:\n\n“Count of me but as one  \nWho am the scribe of love; that when he breathes,  \nTake up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.”\n\nTo which his friend Forese replies:\n\n“Brother!” said he, “the hindrance, which once held  \nThe notary, with Guittone and myself,  \nShort of that new and sweeter style I hear,  \nIs now disclosed: I see how ye your plumes  \nStretch, as the inditer guides them;”\n\nArtistic and verbal fidelity to the very modes of experience is the secret of\nthe sweet new style.\n\nThis concern to follow the very process of intellection rather than to arrive\nat a private point of view, is what lends the air of “universalism” to much\nscholastic meditation. The same concern with the inherent modalities of\nthought and being enable us to feel that “Dante is many men and suffers as\nmany.”[34](ch02a_fn31.html#ch02a_fn31fn34)\n\nPaolo Milano introducing Dante to an English public writes:\n\nThe main point about Dante is this: what he says is never more, is never less,\nthan his initial and total response to the object before him. (Art for him is\nthe form that truth takes on when it is fully perceived.) … Dante never\nindulges in fancy; he never adorns, or magnifies. As he thinks and sees\n(whether with his outer, or his inner eye), so he writes. … His sensory\napprehension is so sure, and his intellectual grasp so direct that he never\ndoubts that he is at the very centre of perception. This is probably the\nsecret of Dante’s celebrated conciseness.[35](ch02a_fn32.html#ch02a_fn32fn35)\n\nWith Dante, as with Aquinas, the literal, the surface is a profound unity, and\nMilano adds (p. xxxvii):\n\nWe live in an age where the split between mind, matter and soul (to use\nDante’s terms) has become so complete that we feel it is about to be reversed.\n… A slow dissociation of these three qualities has been at work for centuries,\nand we are reduced to admire, as if in separate wings of a gallery, the flesh\naccording to Matisse, the mind according to Picasso, and the heart according\nto Rouault.\n\nA sculpturally contoured universalism of experience such as Dante’s is quite\nincompatible with the unified pictorial space which houses the Gutenberg\nconfiguration ahead. For the modalities of mechanical writing and the\ntechnology of movable types were not kind to synesthesia or “the sculpture of\nrhyme.”\n\n### The same clash between written and oral structures of knowledge occurs in\nmedieval social life.\n\nIn Henri Pirenne’s _Economic and Social History of Medieval Europe_ there are\nnumerous structural parallels to the patterns of manuscript culture that have\nso far come to the attention here. The advantage in seeing the clash of forms\nbefore typography is that it enables us to see the turn to the struggle which\nwas given by Gutenberg:\n\nIt is quite plain, from such evidence as we possess, that from the end of the\neighth century Western Europe had sunk back into a purely agricultural state.\nLand was the sole source of subsistence and the sole condition of wealth. All\nclasses of the population, from the Emperor, who had no other revenues than\nthose derived from his landed property, down to the humblest serf, lived\ndirectly or indirectly on the products of the soil, whether they raised them\nby their labour, or confined themselves to collecting and consuming them.\nMovable wealth no longer played any part in economic life. ([p.\n7](ch01.html#page_7))\n\nPirenne is explaining how the feudal estate structure that grew up after the\nRoman collapse was that of numerous “centres without margins.” By contrast,\nthe Roman pattern had been centralist-bureaucratic, with much interplay\nbetween centre and margins. The feudal estate fits the approach to scripture\nthat found the total wealth of meaning in the literal text as inclusive.\nHowever, the new towns and burgesses begin to approach that phase of “one\nlevel at a time” and of specialist knowledge. In the same way, as Pirenne\nobserves, there was no nationalism until the fifteenth century:\n\nIt was not until the fifteenth century that the first symptoms of protection\nbegan to reveal themselves. Before that, there is no evidence of the slightest\ndesire to favour national trade by protecting it from foreign competition. In\nthis respect, the internationalism which characterized medieval civilisation\nright into the thirteenth century was manifested with particular clarity in\nthe conduct of the states. They made no attempt to control the movement of\ncommerce and we should seek in vain for traces of an economic policy deserving\nof the name. ([p. 91](ch02.html#page_91))\n\nJust why typography should have fostered nationalism will become plainer later\non. But the role of literacy and papyrus in making possible the structures of\nearly empires is the theme of Harold Innis in _Empire and Communications_ ([p.\n7](ch01.html#page_7)): “Media which emphasize time are those which are durable\nin character such as parchment, clay and stone. … Media which emphasize space\nare apt to be less durable and light in character such as papyrus and paper.”\n\nWith the availability of quantities of manufactured paper, especially after\nthe twelfth century, the growth of bureaucratic and centralist organization of\ndistant areas got under way again. Pirenne writes ([p.\n211](ch02b.html#page_211)):\n\nOne of the most striking phenomena of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\nis the rapid growth of great commercial companies, each with its affiliations,\ncorrespondents and factors in different parts of the Continent. The example of\nthe powerful Italian companies in the thirteenth century had now found\nfollowers north of the Alps. They had taught men the management of capital,\nbookkeeping and the various forms of credit, and though they continued to\ndominate the trade in money, they found themselves faced by a growing number\nof rivals in the trade in merchandise.\n\nThe peculiar character of medieval town life was its juxtaposition of two\npopulations. There were the burgesses or guildsmen for whom the town mainly\nexisted, and whose effort was to fix prices and standards for goods and\nconditions of citizenship:\n\nThe period in which the craft gilds dominated or influenced the economic\nregime of the towns is also that in which urban protectionism reached its\nheight. However divergent their professional interests might be, all\nindustrial groups were united in their determination to enforce to the utmost\nthe monopoly which each enjoyed and to crush all scope for individual\ninitiative and all possibility of competition. Henceforth the consumer was\ncompletely sacrificed to the producer. The great aim of workers in export\nindustries was to raise wages, that of those engaged in supplying the local\nmarket to raise, or at least to stabilise, prices. Their vision was bounded by\nthe town walls, and all were convinced that their prosperity could be secured\nby the simple expedient of shutting out all competition from outside. Their\nparticularism became more and more rabid; never has the conception that each\nprofession is the exclusive possession of a privileged body been pressed to\nsuch extremes as it was in these medieval crafts. ([pp.\n206](ch02a.html#page_206)–7)\n\nBut side by side with these exclusive persons living the centre-without-margin\nlife, was a growing population of second-class citizens who were engaged in\ninternational trade. They were the _avant-garde_ of what later became the\ndominant middle class:\n\nBut urban industry was not everywhere the same. In many towns, and precisely\nin those which were the most developed, there was, side by side with the\ncraftsmen _-entrepreneurs_ living by the local market, an entirely different\ngroup, which worked for export. Instead of producing only for the limited\nclientèle of the town and its environs, these were the purveyors of the\nwholesale merchants carrying on international commerce. From these merchants\nthey received their raw material, for them they worked, and to them they\ndelivered it in the form of a manufactured article. ([p.\n185](ch02a.html#page_185))\n\nParadoxically, it will be these international deviationists from medieval town\nand guild life who form the nationalist core in the Renaissance. It is\nChaucer’s Host and Wyf of Bath, among others, who are the “outsiders” of their\nsociety. They belong to the international set, as it were, who will become the\nmiddle class in the Renaissance.\n\nThe term _hôtes_ (literally “guests”), which appears more and more frequently\nfrom the beginning of the twelfth century, is characteristic of the movement\nwhich was then going on in rural society. As the name indicates the _hôte_ was\na new-comer, a stranger. He was, in short, a kind of colonist, an immigrant in\nsearch of new lands to cultivate. These colonists were undoubtedly drawn\neither from the vagrant population, from which at the same period the first\nmerchants and the artisans of the towns were being recruited, or from among\nthe inhabitants of the great estates, whose serfdom they thus shook off. ([p.\n69](ch02.html#page_69))\n\n### The medieval world ended in a frenzy of applied knowledge – new medieval\nknowledge applied to the recreation of antiquity.\n\nThe great study of _The Waning of the Middle Ages_ by J. Huizinga is almost\nentirely concerned with the feudal nobility, whose tenure had been greatly\nmodified by the medieval guildsmen, and was to be quite diminished by the\nmiddle class that later came with typography. In many ways, Huizinga is\nbaffled by the medieval world as much as Heinrich Wolfflin was by medieval\nart. Both men hit upon the idea of applying to it the formulas of primitive\nand child art and living. And this approach works up to a point, since the\ntactile bounding lines of childhood visual life are not far from those of non-\nliterate sensibility. Huizinga writes ([p. 9](ch01.html#page_9)):\n\nTo the world when it was half a thousand years younger, the outlines of all\nthings seemed more clearly marked than to us. The contrast between suffering\nand joy, between adversity and happiness, appeared more striking. All\nexperience had yet to the minds of men the directness and absoluteness of the\npleasure and pain of child-life. Every event, every action, was still embodied\nin expressive, and solemn forms, which raised them to the dignity of a ritual.\nFor it was not merely the great facts of birth, marriage and death which, by\nthe sacredness of the sacrament, were raised to the rank of mysteries;\nincidents of less importance, like a journey, a task, a visit, were equally\nattended by a thousand formalities: benedictions, ceremonies, formulae.\n\nCalamities and indigence were more afflicting than at present; it was more\ndifficult to guard against them, and to find solace. Illness and health\npresented a more striking contrast; the cold and darkness of winter were more\nreal evils. Honours and riches were relished with greater avidity and\ncontrasted more vividly with surrounding misery. We, at the present day, can\nhardly understand the keenness with which a fur coat, a good fire on the\nhearth, a soft bed, a glass of wine, were formerly enjoyed.\n\nThen, again, all things in life were of a proud or cruel publicity. Lepers\nsounded their rattles and went about in processions, beggars exhibited their\ndeformity and their misery in churches. Every order and estate, every rank and\nprofession, was distinguished by its costume. The great lords never moved\nabout without a glorious display of arms and liveries, exciting fear and envy.\nExecutions and other public acts of justice, hawking, marriages and funerals,\nwere all announced by cries and processions, songs and music.\n\nAssociating the developments of five hundred years of Gutenberg technology\nwith uniformity, quiet privacy, and individualism, Huizinga finds it easy to\ngive us the pre-Gutenberg world in terms of diversity, passionate group life,\nand communal rituals. That is exactly what he does on [page\n40](ch02.html#page_40): “Here, then, we have attained a point of view from\nwhich we can consider the lay culture of the waning Middle Ages; aristocratic\nlife decorated by ideal forms, gilded by chivalrous romanticism, a world\ndisguised in the fantastic gear of the Round Table.”\n\nThe magnificent Hollywood sets which Huizinga provides as an image of the\nmedieval decline blend perfectly with the evocations of the ancient world done\nby the Medici craftsmen. What Huizinga may have chosen to disregard was the\nrise of middle-class wealth and skill and organization which made possible\nboth the splendours of the Dukes of Burgundy and of the Medicis. He says of\nthe great Dukes ([p. 41](ch02.html#page_41)):\n\nThe court was pre-eminently the field where this aestheticism flourished.\nNowhere did it attain to greater development than at the court of the dukes of\nBurgundy, which was more pompous and better arranged than that of the kings of\nFrance. It is well known how much importance the dukes attached to the\nmagnificence of their household. A splendid court could, better than anything\nelse, convince rivals of the high rank the dukes claimed to occupy among the\nprinces of Europe. “After the deeds and exploits of war, which are claims to\nglory,” says Chastellain, “the household is the first thing that strikes the\neye, and which it is, therefore, most necessary to conduct and arrange well.”\nIt was boasted that the Burgundian court was the richest and best regulated of\nall. Charles the Bold, especially, had the passion of magnificence.\n\nIt was the new middle-class wealth and skill that translated the chivalric\ndream into the visual panorama. Surely we have here an early phase of “know-\nhow” and practical _applied_ knowledge such as in centuries to come was to\ncreate complex markets, price-systems, and commercial empires unconceivable to\noral and even to manuscript cultures.\n\nThe same urge to translate the tactile skills of the older crafts into the\nvisual magnificence of the Renaissance rituals provided an esthetic\nmedievalism in the North, and in Italy inspired the recreation of ancient art,\nletters and architecture. The same sensibility that led the Dukes of Burgundy\nand Berry to their _très riches heures_ led the Italian merchant princes to\nrestore ancient Rome. It was a kind of applied archeological knowledge in both\ncases. The same applied knowledge in the interests of new visual intensity and\ncontrol inspired Gutenberg and led to two centuries of medievalism of a scope\nand degree unknown to the Middle Ages themselves. For until printing, very few\nbooks ancient or medieval were available at all. Those that existed were seen\nby few. The same situation obtained in painting until recent colour-engraving\ndeveloped, as André Malraux has explained in his _Museum Without Walls._\n\n### Renaissance Italy became a kind of Hollywood collection of **SETS** of\nantiquity, and the new visual antiquarianism of the Renaissance provided an\navenue to power for men of any class.\n\nWyndham Lewis in _The Lion and the Fox_ ([p. 86](ch02.html#page_86)) has given\na fine statement of the Italian antiquarianism:\n\nThe prince or commander of the army of a state had often started as a free\ncaptain; and birth or training, in this age that has been called that of\nbastards and adventurers, never mattered less. Muzio Sforza started life as a\nfield labourer: Niccolo Piccinini as a butcher: Carmagnola as a herdsman. We\ncan agree that it must have been “singular to see these men – generally of low\norigin and devoid of culture – surrounded in their camps by ambassadors, poets\nand learned men, who read to them Livy and Cicero, and original verses, in\nwhich they were compared to Scipio and Hannibal, to Caesar and Alexander.” But\nthey were all acting on a tiny scale the past that was being unearthed, just\nas English statesmen were modelling themselves at the time of England’s great\nexpansion on the statesmen of Roman antiquity. With the more intelligent of\nthem, like Cesare Borgia, this archaeological and analogic habit of mind\nassumed the proportion of a mania. His “Aut Caesar aut nihil” is the same type\nof literature as is concentrated in the small maniacal figure of Julien Sorel,\nStendhal’s little domestic Napoleon. Borgia’s motto itself is reminiscent of\nthe title of a book popular before the war in Germany: _Wordly Power or\nDownfall._\n\nLewis is right in pointing up the frequently shoddy and immature inspiration\nof much of this:\n\nThe Republican would call himself Brutus, the _littérateur_ would be Cicero,\nand so forth. They attempted to bring to life the heroes of antiquity, and\nrecall in their own lives the events recorded in the codices, and it was this\nimmediate application of everything to life in Italian Renaissance society\n(like the substitution of a cinema for a history-book in a school) that made\nthe Italian influence so vivid in the rest of Europe. Renaissance Italy was\nvery exactly a kind of Los Angeles, where historical scenes were tried out,\nantique buildings imitated and roughly run up, and dramatic crimes\nreconstructed.\n\nHow the association of learning and political crime came about is shown by\nVillari as follows:\n\n“Those were days in which every Italian seemed a born diplomatist: the\nmerchant, the man of letters, the captain of adventures, knew how to address\nand discourse with kings and emperors, duly observing all conventional forms,\n… The dispatches of our ambassadors were among the chief historical and\nliterary monuments of those times …\n\n“It was then that adventurers, immovable by threats, prayers or pity, were\nsure to yield to the verses of a learned man. Lorenzo de’ Medici went to\nNaples, and by force of argument persuaded Ferrante d’Aragona to put an end to\nthe war and conclude an alliance with him. Alfonso the Magnanimous, a prisoner\nof Filippo Maria Visconti, and whom all believed dead, was instead honourably\nliberated because he had the skill to convince that gloomy and cruel tyrant\nthat it would better serve his turn to have the Aragonese at Naples than the\nfollowers of Anjou. … In a revolution at Prato, got up by Bernardo Nardi, this\nleader … had already thrown the halter round the neck of the Florentine\nPodestà when the latter’s fine reasoning persuaded him to spare his life …”\n([pp. 86](ch02.html#page_86)–7)\n\nSuch was also the world which Huizinga portrays in _The Waning of the Middle\nAges._ It was medievalism plus a visual slickness and pomp and opulence made\npossible by the new wealth and applied knowledge of the middle class. As we\nmove into the Renaissance it is needful to understand that the new _age of\napplied knowledge_ is an age of translation not only of languages but of\ncenturies of accumulated audile-tactile experience into visual terms.\nTherefore what Huizinga and Villari stress as vivid and new in the applied\nhistorical antiquarianism will be found to prove equally characteristic in\nmathematics and science and economics.\n\n### Medieval idols of the king\n\nThe mounting passion for visualizing knowledge and separating functions in the\nlater Middle Ages is given extensive documentation in a major study by Ernst\nH. Kantorowicz. _The King’s Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political\nTheology_ illustrates in detail how medieval jurists were animated by the same\npassion that led later medieval scientists to separate kinematics and\ndynamics, as is described by A. C. Crombie in _Medieval and Early Modern\nScience._\n\nLate in his great study, Kantorowicz summarizes a good deal of his theme in a\nway that indicates how the legal fictions clustering about the separation of\nthe King’s two bodies led to such characteristic fantasies as the _danses\nmacabres._ These, indeed, made up a kind of animated cartoon world which\ndominated even Shakespearean imagery, and continued to flourish in the\neighteenth century, as Gray’s _Elegy_ testifies. It was the English in the\nfourteenth century who developed the effigy in funerary rites as a visible\nexpression of the King’s two bodies. Kantorowicz writes (pp. 420–1):\n\nNo matter how we may wish to explain the introduction of the effigy in 1327,\nwith the funeral of Edward II there begins, to our knowledge, the custom of\nplacing on top of the coffin the “roiall representation” or “personage,” a\nfigure or image _ad similitudinem regis_ , which – made of wood or of leather\npadded with bombast and covered with plaster – was dressed in the coronation\ngarments or, later on, in the parliamentary robe. The effigy displayed the\ninsignia of sovereignty: on the head of the image (worked apparently since\nHenry VII after the death mask) there was the crown, while the artificial\nhands held orb and scepter. Wherever the circumstances were not to the\ncontrary, the effigies were henceforth used at the burials of royalty:\nenclosed in the coffin of lead, which itself was encased in a casket of wood,\nthere rested the corpse of the king, his mortal and normally visible – though\nnow invisible – body natural; whereas his normally invisible body politic was\non this occasion visibly displayed by the effigy in its pompous regalia: a\n_persona ficta_ – the effigy – impersonating a _persona ficta_ – the\n_Dignitas._\n\nThe division between the ruler’s private and his corporate Dignity, elaborated\nby Italian jurists for centuries, flourished in France, also. Kantorowicz\nquotes (p. 422) a French lawyer, Pierre Grégoire, in the later sixteenth\ncentury, writing (as if he were commenting of _King Lear_): “The Majesty of\nGod appears in the Prince _externally_ , for the utility of the subjects; but\n_internally_ there remains what is human.” And the great English jurist Coke\nobserved that the mortal king was God-made, but the immortal King man-made.\n\nActually, the importance of the king’s effigy in the funerary rites of the\nsixteenth century soon matched or even eclipsed that of the dead body itself.\nNoticeable as early as 1498, at the funeral of Charles VIII, and fully\ndeveloped in 1547, at the rites held for Francis I, the display of the effigy\nwas connected successively with the new political ideas of that age,\nindicating, for example, that the royal Dignity never died and that in the\nimage of the dead king’s jurisdiction continued until the day he was buried.\nUnder the impact of those ideas – strengthened by influences deriving from the\nmedieval _tableaux vivants_, the Italian _trionfi_ , and the study as well as\nthe application of classical texts – the ceremonial connected with the effigy\nbegan to be filled with new contents and to affect fundamentally the funerary\nmood itself: a new triumphal element came into the ceremony which was absent\nin earlier times. (p. 423)\n\nKantorowicz here and in many other passages helps us to understand how the\nanalytic separation of functions was steadily intensified by visual\nmanifestation. The long passage that follows (from pages 436 and 437 of _The\nKing’s Two Bodies_) will reinforce the Huizinga themes and further illuminate\nShakespeare’s _King Lear_ , which has a great relevance to the Gutenberg\nmotifs of the Renaissance:\n\nOur rapid digression on funerary ceremonial, effigies, and sepulchral\nmonuments, though not directly related to the rites observed for English\nkings, has nevertheless yielded at least one new aspect of the problem of the\n“two Bodies” – the human background. Never perhaps, except in those “late\nGothic” centuries, was the Western mind so keenly conscious of the discrepancy\nbetween the transience of the flesh and the immortal splendor of a Dignity\nwhich that flesh was supposed to represent. We understand how it could happen\nthat the juristic distinctions, though developing quite independently and in a\ntotally different thought compartment, eventually fell in with some very\ngeneral sentiments, and that the jurists’ imaginative fictions met with\ncertain feelings which in the age of the _Danses macabres_ , where all\nDignities danced with Death, must have been peculiarly close to the surface.\nThe jurists, as it were, discovered the immortality of the Dignity; but by\nthis very discovery they made the ephemeral nature of the mortal incumbent all\nthe more tangible. We should not forget that the uncanny juxtaposition of a\ndecaying corpse and an immortal Dignity as displayed by the sepulchral\nmonuments, or the sharp dichotomy of the lugubrious funeral train surrounding\nthe corpse and the triumphant float of an effigy-dummy wrapped in regalia, was\nfostered, after all, in the same ground, came from the same world of thought\nand sentiment, evolved in the same intellectual climate, in which the\njuridical tenets concerning the “King’s two Bodies” achieved their final\nformulation. In both instances, there was a body mortal, God-made and\ntherefore “subject to all Infirmities that come by Nature or Accident,” set\nagainst another body, man-made and therefore immortal, which is “utterly void\nof Infancy and old Age and other Defects and Imbecilities.”\n\nIn short, one revelled in strong contrasts of fictitious immortality and man’s\ngenuine mortality, contrasts which the Renaissance, through its insatiable\ndesire to immortalize the individual by any contrivable _tour de force_ , not\nonly failed to mitigate, but rather intensified: there was a reverse side to\nthe proud reconquest of a terrestrial _aevum._ At the same time, however,\nimmortality – the decisive mark of divinity, but vulgarized by the artifice of\ncountless fictions – was about to lose its absolute, or even its imaginary,\nvalues: unless it manifested itself incessantly through new mortal\nincarnations, it practically ceased to be immortality. The King could not die,\nwas not allowed to die, lest scores of fictions of immortality were to break\ndown; and while kings died, they were granted the comfort of being told that\nat least “as King” they “never died.” The jurists themselves, who had done so\nmuch to build up the myths of fictitious and immortal personalities,\nrationalized the weakness of their creatures, and while elaborating their\nsurgical distinctions between the immortal Dignity and its mortal incumbent\nand talking about two different bodies, they had to admit that their\npersonified immortal Dignity was unable to act, to work, to will, or to decide\nwithout the debility of mortal men who bore the Dignity and yet would return\nto dust.\n\nNevertheless, since life becomes transparent only against the background of\ndeath, and death against the background of life, the bone-rattling vitality of\nthe late Middle Ages appears not devoid of some deeper wisdom. What one did\nwas to build up a philosophy according to which a fictitious immortality\nbecame transparent through a real mortal man as its temporary incarnation,\nwhile mortal man became transparent through that new fictitious immortality\nwhich, being man-made as immortality always, was neither that of life eternal\nin another world nor that of the godhead, but that of a very terrestrial\npolitical institution.\n\nThe Roman jurists had also conceived an “objectivication” of the ruler’s\n_persona publica_ , and the Roman emperor is sometimes called “a corporation\nsole.” But neither Greek nor Roman antecedents can explain the concept of the\nKing’s _two bodies._ It was the aggressive Pauline concept of the Church as\n_corpus Christi_ , says Kantorowicz (pp. 505–6), that “eventually endowed the\nlate antique “corporations” with a philosophico-theological impetus which\napparently those bodies were lacking before Constantine the Great referred to\nthe Church as a _corpus_ and thereby introduced that philosophical and\ntheological notion into the language of law.”\n\nAs with any medieval development at all, the later phases show a preference\nfor an increasingly visual stress. And so it is with the King’s two bodies. In\n1542 Henry VIII addressed his council: “We be informed by our judges that we\nat no time stand so highly in our estate royal as in the time of Parliament,\nwherein we as head and you as members are conjoined and knit together in one\nbody politic.”\n\nThe organological idea of mystical tribal unity was in itself only partly\nvisual. Merely visual stress in the Renaissance “now served Henry VIII to\nincorporate the _Anglicana Ecclesia_ , so to speak, the genuine _corpus\nmysticum_ of his “empire, into the _corpus politicum_ of England, of which he\nas king was the head.” That is to say, Henry translated the non-visible into\nthe visible exactly in keeping with the science of his age, which was giving\nvisual form to non-visual forces. And the same transformation of the audible\ninto the visual word was the prime effect of typography.\n\nIn a very interesting passage (vol. II, [pp. 103](ch02.html#page_103)–4) of\nhis _Medieval and Early Modern Science_ , A. C. Crombie argues that:\n\nMany scholars now agree that 15th-century humanism, which arose in Italy and\nspread northwards, was an interruption in the development of science. The\n“revival of letters” deflected interest from matter to literary style and, in\nturning back to classical antiquity, its devotees affected to ignore the\nscientific progress of the previous three centuries. The same absurd conceit\nthat led the humanists to abuse and misrepresent their immediate predecessors\nfor using Latin constructions unknown to Cicero and to put out the propaganda\nwhich, in varying degrees, has captivated historical opinion until quite\nrecently, also allowed them to borrow from the scholastics without\nacknowledgment. This habit affected almost all the great scientists of the\n16th and 17th centuries, whether Catholic or Protestant, and it has required\nthe labours of a Duhem or a Thorndike or a Maier to show that their statements\non matters of history cannot be accepted at their face value.\n\nCrombie grants that some of the older science became more accessible _via_\nprinting; but does he not simply ignore the dynamic of later medieval science\ntowards visual formulation? For, to translate force and energy into visual\ngraphs and experiments was, as it continued to be until the discovery of\nelectro-magnetic waves, the heart of modern science. Today, visualization is\nrecessive and this makes us aware of its peculiar strategies during the\nRenaissance.\n\n### The invention of typography confirmed and extended the new visual stress\nof applied knowledge, providing the first uniformly repeatable **COMMODITY** ,\nthe first assembly-line, and the first mass-production.\n\nThe invention of typography, as such, is an example of the application of the\nknowledge of traditional crafts to a special visual problem. Abbott Payson\nUsher devotes the tenth chapter of his _History of Mechanical Inventions_ to\n“The Invention of Printing,” saying ([p. 238](ch02b.html#page_238)) that more\nthan any other single achievement, it “marks the line of division between\nmedieval and modern technology … We see here the same transfer to the field of\nthe imagination that is clearly evident in all the work of Leonardo da Vinci.”\nFrom now on “imagination” will tend more and more to refer to the powers of\nvisualization.\n\nThe mechanization of the scribal art was probably the first reduction of any\nhandicraft to mechanical terms. That is, it was the first translation of\nmovement into a series of static shots or frames. Typography bears much\nresemblance to cinema, just as the reading of print puts the reader in the\nrole of the movie projector. The reader moves the series of imprinted letters\nbefore him at a speed consistent with apprehending the motions of the author’s\nmind. The reader of print, that is, stands in an utterly different relation to\nthe writer from the reader of manuscript. Print gradually made reading aloud\npointless, and accelerated the act of reading till the reader could feel “in\nthe hands of” his author. We shall see that just as print was the first mass-\nproduced thing, so it was the first uniform and repeatable “commodity.” The\nassembly line of movable types made possible a product that was uniform and as\nrepeatable as a scientific experiment. Such a character does not belong to the\nmanuscript. The Chinese in printing from blocks in the eighth century, had\nbeen mainly impressed by the repetitive character of print as “magical” and\nhad used it as an alternative form to the prayer wheel.\n\nWilliam Ivins has made a more thorough analysis of the esthetic effects of\nprints and typography on our human habits of perception than anybody else. In\n_Prints and Visual Communication_ ([pp. 55](ch02.html#page_55)–6) he writes:\n\nEach written or printed word is a series of conventional instructions for the\nmaking in a specified linear order of muscular movements which when fully\ncarried out result in a succession of sounds. These sounds, like the forms of\nthe letters, are made according to arbitrary recipes or directions, which\nindicate by convention certain loosely defined classes of muscular movements\nbut not any specifically specified ones. Thus any printed set of words can\nactually be pronounced in an infinitely large number of ways, of which, if we\nleave aside purely personal peculiarities, Cockney, Lower East Side, North\nShore, and Georgia, may serve as typical specimens. The result is that each\nsound we hear when we listen to anyone speaking is merely a representative\nmember of a large class of sounds which we have agreed to accept as\nsymbolically identical in spite of the actual differences between them.\n\nIn this passage he not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits,\nbut, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience in\nprint culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to\nthe background. The reduction of experience to a single sense, the visual, as\na result of typography leads him to speculate that “the more closely we\nconfine our data for reasoning about things to data that come to us through\none and the same sense channel the more apt we are to be correct in our\nreasoning.” ([p. 54](ch02.html#page_54)) However, this type of reduction or\ndistortion of all experience to the scale of one sense only is in tendency the\neffect of typography on the arts and sciences as well as upon human\nsensibility. Thus the habit of a fixed position or “point of view” so natural\nto the reader of typography, gave popular extension to the _avant-garde_\nperspectivism of the fifteenth century:\n\nPerspective rapidly became an essential part of the technique of making\ninformative pictures, and before long was demanded of pictures that were not\ninformative. Its introduction had much to do with that western European\npreoccupation with verisimilitude, which is probably the distinguishing mark\nof subsequent European picture making. The third of these events was Nicholas\nof Cusa’s enunciation, in 1440, of the first thorough-going doctrines of the\nrelativity of knowledge and of the continuity, through transitions and middle\nterms, between extremes. This was a fundamental challenge to definitions and\nideas that had tangled thought since the time of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThese things, the exactly repeatable pictorial statement, a logical grammar\nfor representation of space relationship in pictorial statements, and the\nconcepts of relativity and continuity, were and still are superficially so\nunrelated that they are rarely thought of seriously in conjunction with one\nanother. But, between them, they have revolutionized both the descriptive\nsciences and the mathematics on which the science of physics rests, and in\naddition they are essential to a great deal of modern technology. Their\neffects on art have been very marked. They were absolutely new things in the\nworld. There was no precedent for them in classical practice or thought of any\nkind or variety. ([pp. 23](ch02.html#page_23)–4)\n\n###\n\nA fixed point of view becomes possible with print and ends the image as a\nplastic organism.\n\nIvins is right in pointing to the interplay among many factors in this way.\nBut the technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from\nnoting interplay and, as it were, “formal” causality, both in our inner and\nexternal lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions\nand fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and\ncompartmentalizing or specialist outlook. As Gyorgy Kepes explains in _The\nLanguage of Vision_ ([p. 200](ch02a.html#page_200)):\n\nLiterary imitation of nature tied to a fixed point of observation had killed\nthe image as a plastic organism. … Non-representational art clarified the\nstructural laws of the plastic image. It reestablished the image in its\noriginal role as a dynamic experience based upon the properties of the senses\nand their plastic organization. But it threw overboard the meaningful signs of\nthe visual relationships.\n\nThat is, the explicit visual linking of components in a composition, verbal or\nnon-verbal, began to fascinate and compel most minds in the later fifteenth\ncentury. Kepes specifies this explicit visual linking as “literary” and as the\nimmediate occasion of the dissociation of the interplay of the various\nproperties of all the senses. He adds ([p. 200](ch02a.html#page_200)):\n\nThe image was “purified.” But this purification overlooked the fact that the\ndistortion and disintegration of the image as a plastic experience had not\nbeen due to represented meaningful signs as such but rather to the prevailing\nrepresentation-concept which was static and limited, and consequently in\ncontradiction to the dynamic plastic nature of the visual experience. The\nstructure of meaning had been based upon the same conception which generated\nthe fixed point of view of space representation, linear perspective and\nmodelling by shading.\n\nThe involuntary and subliminal character of this private or “fixed point of\nview” depends on the isolation of the visual factor in\nexperience.[36](ch02a_fn33.html#ch02a_fn33fn36) It is upon this “fixed point\nof view” that the triumphs and destructions of the Gutenberg era will be made.\nSince there is widespread misunderstanding about the flat, two-dimensional,\nmosaic form in art and experience, the evidence which Kepes provides in _The\nLanguage of Vision_ is very much needed. In fact, the two-dimensional is the\nopposite of inert, as Georg von Bekesy discovered in the study of hearing. For\ndynamic simultaneity is the effect of the two-dimensional, and inert\nhomogeneity the effect of three-dimensionality. Kepes explains ([p.\n96](ch02.html#page_96)):\n\nEarly medieval painters often repeated the main figure many times in the same\npicture. Their purpose was to represent all possible relationships that\naffected him, and they recognized this could be done only by a simultaneous\ndescription of various actions. This connectedness in meaning, rather than the\nmechanical logic of geometrical optics, is the essential task of\nrepresentation.\n\nThere is then this great paradox of the Gutenberg era, that its seeming\nactivism is cinematic in the strict movie sense. It is a consistent series of\nstatic shots or “fixed points of view” in homogeneous relationship.\nHomogenization of men and materials will become the great program of the\nGutenberg era, the source of wealth and power unknown to any other time or\ntechnology.\n\n### How the **NATURAL MAGIC** of the **CAMERA OBSCURA** anticipated Hollywood\nin turning the spectacle of the external world into a consumer commodity or\npackage.\n\nA quite celebrated novelty and pastime of the Renaissance relates directly to\nthe increasing visual stress in experience, namely the delight which was taken\nin the use of the _camera obscura._ Erik Barnouw has an excellent brief\naccount of this form of entertainment in his _Mass Communication_ ([pp.\n13](ch02.html#page_13)–14):\n\nIn the days when Johann Gutenberg’s Bible, printed from movable type, was\nstirring wonder in Germany, another innovation was gaining a foothold in\nItaly. It was a kind of game, having at first no apparent relationship to the\ndissemination of information or ideas.\n\nThe device was described in Leonardo da Vinci’s unpublished notes. If on a\nsunny day you sit in a darkened room with only a pinhole open on one side, you\nsee on an opposite wall or other surface images of the outside world – a tree,\na man, a passing carriage.\n\nThe principle was described in detail in the book, _Natural Magic_, by\nGiovanni Battista della Porta, published in 1558. A few years later it became\nknown that a lens, in place of the pinhole, would sharpen the image.\n\nA group of people in a darkened room, watching images on a wall – thrown by a\nbeam of light cutting through the darkness – must have resembled a group\nwatching home movies. There was one difference: the picture was upside down.\n\nPresently the lens was being put in one side of a box instead of in the wall\nof a room. Through mirrors the image could be thrown on a glass screen in the\nbox, and seen right side up.\n\nThe box, still thought of as a small room, was called a “dark room” or\n_“camera obscura.”_ This camera could be aimed at a landscape, street, garden\nparty. A group of people looking in amazement at the moving images in the box\nmay well have resembled a group watching television.\n\nMagicians began using the device for mystification and delight. It became a\npastime among the well-to-do throughout Europe.\n\nBy the 1600’s, painters in many countries were using it to solve problems of\nperspective. Some artists found it easier to trace the two-dimensional image\nof the _camera obscura_ than to work from three-dimensional reality.\n\nThe next step was obvious. Could the image be preserved, saving the artist\neven more work? The idea seems to have been present for two centuries,\nawaiting the development of chemistry – and of demand.\n\n### St. Thomas More offers a plan for a bridge over the turbulent river of\nscholastic philosophy.\n\nAs we stand on the frontiers between the manuscript and the typographical\nworlds, it is indispensable that a good deal of comparison and contrast of the\ntraits of these two cultures be done here. Much insight into the Gutenberg era\ncan be had from observation of the scribal era. A familiar passage from St.\nThomas More’s popular _Utopia_ ([pp. 39](ch02.html#page_39)–40) will serve as\na start:\n\n“That is yt whyche I mente” (quod he), “when I said phylosophye hadde no place\namonge kinges.” “In dede” (quode I) “this schole philosophie hath not; whiche\nthinketh all thynges mete for euery place. But ther is an other philosophye\nmore cyuyle, whyche knoweth as ye wolde saye her owne stage, and thereafter\norderynge and behauynge herselfe in the playe that she hathe in hande,\nplayethe her parte accordynglye wyth comlynes, vtteringe nothynge owte of dewe\nordre and fassyon.”\n\nWriting in 1516, More is aware that the medieval scholastic dialogue, oral and\nconversational, is quite unsuited to the new problems of large centralist\nstates. A new kind of processing of problems, one thing at a time, “nothing\nout of due order and fashion,” must succeed to the older dialogue. For the\nscholastic method was a simultaneous mosaic, a dealing with many aspects and\nlevels of meaning in crisp simultaneity. This method will no longer serve in\nthe new lineal era. A recent book, _Ramus: Method and the Decay of Dialogue_ ,\nby Father Ong is entirely concerned with this previously obscure subject,\nwhich he illuminates brilliantly. His investigation of the transformation of\nlater scholasticism into visual “method,” will be a major aid in the next\nphase of the Gutenberg configuration of events. More in the second book of his\n_Utopia_ ([p. 82](ch02.html#page_82)) also shows his entire awareness of the\nhomogenizing process of the later scholasticism of his own day. He is happy to\nrecord that Utopians are old-fashioned: “But as they in all thynges be almost\nequall to our olde auncyente clerkes, so our new Logiciens in subtyll\ninventyons have farre passed and gone beyonde them. For they have not devised\none of all those rules of restryctyons, and amplyfycatyons, and supposytyons,\nvery wittelye invented in the small Logycalles, whyche heare oure chyldren in\neuerye place do learne.”\n\nBoth _L’Apparition du livre_ by Febvre and Martin, and Curt Buhler’s _The\nFifteenth Century Book_ are extensive studies of the transition from scribal\nto typographical culture. Together with Ong’s _Ramus_ , it will be possible to\nuse these three great studies to give an entirely new understanding of the\nevents that make up the Gutenberg galaxy. As might be expected, the printed\nbook was a long time in being recognized as anything but a typescript, a more\naccessible and portable kind of manuscript. It is this kind of transitional\nawareness that in our own century is recorded in words and phrases such as\n“horseless carriage,” “wireless,” or “moving-pictures.” “Telegraph” and\n“television” seem to have registered a more direct impact than mechanical\nforms such as typography and movies. Yet it would have been just as difficult\nto explain the Gutenberg innovation to a man in the sixteenth century as it is\nnow to explain the utter diversity of TV and film images. Today we like to\nthink that there is much in common between the mosaic image of television and\nthe pictorial space of the photograph. In fact, they have nothing in common.\nNeither did the printed book and the manuscript. Yet both the producer and\nconsumer of the printed page conceived of it as a direct continuation of the\nmanuscript. In the same way the nineteenth century newspaper underwent\ncomplete revolution with the advent of the telegraph. The mechanical printed\npage was crossed with a new organic form that changed layout as it changed\npolitics and society.\n\nToday with the arrival of automation, the ultimate extension of the electro-\nmagnetic form to the organization of production, we are trying to cope with\nsuch new organic production as if it were mechanical mass-production. In 1500\nnobody knew how to market or distribute the mass-produced printed book. It was\nhandled in the old manuscript channels. And the manuscript, like any other\nhandicraft produce, was sold in the way in which we now handle “old masters.”\nThat is, the manuscript market was mainly a second-hand market.\n\n### Scribal culture could have neither authors nor publics such as were\ncreated by typography.\n\nAlthough we have seen with Hajnal a good deal about the scribal making of\nbooks, the assumptions and attitudes of authors about books and readers has\nnot been looked at. Since it was precisely these assumptions that were to\nundergo very great changes, it is necessary to specify them, however\nsuccinctly. For this purpose the work of E. P. Goldschmidt, _Medieval Texts\nand Their First Appearance in Print_ , is indispensable. His study of the\nhabits and procedures of authorship under manuscript conditions leads him to\nconclude ([p. 116](ch02.html#page_116)):\n\nWhat I have tried to demonstrate is that the Middle Ages for various reasons\nand from various causes did not possess the concept of “authorship” in exactly\nthe same significance as we have it now. Much of the prestige and glamour with\nwhich we moderns invest the term, and which makes us look upon an author who\nhas succeeded in getting a book published as having progressed a stage nearer\nto becoming a great man, must be a recent accretion. The indifference of\nmedieval scholars to the precise identity of the authors whose books they\nstudied is undeniable. The writers themselves, on the other hand, did not\nalways trouble to “quote” what they took from other books or to indicate where\nthey took it from; they were diffident about signing even what was clearly\ntheir own in an unambiguous and unmistakable manner.\n\nThe invention of printing did away with many of the technical causes of\nanonymity, while at the same time the movement of the Renaissance created new\nideas of literary fame and intellectual property.\n\nIt is not entirely self-evident today that typography should have been the\nmeans and occasion of individualism and self-expression in society. That it\nshould have been the means of fostering habits of private property, privacy,\nand many forms of “enclosure” is, perhaps, more evident. But most obvious is\nthe fact of printed publication as the direct means of fame and perpetual\nmemory. For, until the modern movie, there had been in the world no means of\nbroadcasting a private image to equal the printed book. Manuscript culture did\nnot foster any grand ideas in this department. Print did. Most of the\nRenaissance megalomania from Aretino to Tamburlaine is the immediate child of\ntypography which provided the physical means of extending the dimensions of\nthe private author in space and time. But to the student of manuscript\nculture, as Goldschmidt says ([p. 88](ch02.html#page_88)): “One thing is\nimmediately obvious: before 1500 or thereabouts people did not attach the same\nimportance to ascertaining the precise identity of the author of a book they\nwere reading or quoting as we do now. We very rarely find them discussing such\npoints.”\n\nOddly enough, it is a consumer-oriented culture that is concerned about\nauthors and labels of authenticity. Manuscript culture was producer-oriented,\nalmost entirely a do-it-yourself culture, and naturally looked to the\nrelevance and usability of items rather than their sources.\n\nThe practice of multiplying literary texts by typography has brought about\nsuch a profound change in our attitude towards the book and in our appraisal\nof different literary activities, that it requires some effort of historical\nimagination to realize vividly the very different conditions under which books\nwere produced, acquired, disseminated, and procured in medieval times. I must\nask you to be a little patient in following some of the reflections I am about\nto set down which may well appear to be obvious and self-evident. But it can\nhardly be denied that these material conditions are much too often lost sight\nof in discussing literary problems of the Middle Ages, and that our mental\ninertia tends to make us apply criteria of value and of conduct to the writers\nof medieval books which have originated in our minds under totally different\nmodern conditions. ([p. 89](ch02.html#page_89))\n\nNot only was private authorship in the later print meanings unknown, but there\nwas no reading public in our sense, either. This is a matter that has usually\nbeen confused with ideas about “the extent of literacy.” But even if literacy\nwere universal, under manuscript conditions an author would still have no\npublic. An advanced scientist today has no public. He has a few friends and\ncolleagues with whom he talks about his work. What we need to have in mind is\nthat the manuscript book was slow to read and slow to move or be circulated.\nGoldschmidt asks ([p. 90](ch02.html#page_90)) us to\n\ntry to visualize a medieval author at work in his study. Having conceived the\nplan to compose a book, he would first of all proceed to collect material and\nto accumulate notes. He would search for books on kindred subjects, firstly in\nthe library of his own monastery. If he found something he could use, he would\nwrite out relevant chapters or entire pieces on sheets of vellum, which he\nwould keep in his cell to be made use of in due course. If in the course of\nhis reading he came upon a mention of a book which was not available in his\nlibrary, he would be anxious to find out where he could obtain sight of it,\nnot an easy matter in those days. He would write to friends in other abbeys\nreputed to have big libraries to inquire whether they knew of a copy, and he\nwould have to wait a long time for their replies. A large part of the extant\ncorrespondence of medieval scholars consists of such requests for search after\nthe whereabouts of some book, requests for copies of books which are said to\nexist in the place of the addressee’s residence, requests for the loan of\nbooks for copying purposes …\n\nAuthorship before print was in a large degree the building of a mosaic:\n\nNowadays, when an author dies, we can see clearly that his own printed works\nstanding in his bookcases are those works which he regarded as completed and\nfinished, and that they are in the form in which he wished to transmit them to\nposterity; his handwritten”papers,” lying in his drawers, would obviously be\nregarded differently; they were clearly not considered by him as ultimately\nfinished and done with. But in the days before the invention of printing this\ndistinction would not by any means be so apparent. Nor could it be determined\nso easily by others whether any particular piece written in the dead author’s\nhandwriting was of his own composition or a copy made by him of somebody\nelse’s work. Here we have an obvious source of a great deal of the anonymity\nand ambiguity of authorship of so many of our medieval texts. ([p.\n92](ch02.html#page_92))\n\nNot only was the assembly of the parts of the book often a collective scribal\naffair, but librarians and users of books took a large hand in composition\nsince small books which only took a few pages, could never be transmitted\nexcept in volumes of miscellaneous content. “These volumes comprising many\npieces, which probably constituted the majority of the books in the library,\nwere created as units not by the authors or even by the scribes but by the\nlibrarians or bookbinders (very often identical).” ([p.\n94](ch02.html#page_94))\n\nGoldschmidt then points out ([pp. 96](ch02.html#page_96)–7) many other\ncircumstances of pre-print book-making and -using that rendered authorship\nvery secondary:\n\nWhatever the method adopted, a volume containing twenty different pieces by\nten different authors would necessarily have to be listed under one name,\nwhatever the librarian might decide to do about the other nine names. And if\nthe first tract in the volume was by St. Augustine, under St. Augustine it\nwould go. If you wanted to see the volume you would have to ask for St.\nAugustine, even if it should be the fifth treatise in the volume you wanted to\nconsult, which might be by Hugo de Sancto Caro. And if you asked a friend in\nanother abbey to copy something for you which you had noted on a former visit\nyou would have to write to him: “Please copy the treatise on fols. 50 to 70 in\nyour ‘Augustinus.’” This would not necessarily imply that the writer was not\naware that the author of this treatise was not Augustinus; whether he thought\nso or not, he would have to request this book “ex Augustino.” In another\nlibrary this same text, say the _De duodecim abusivis_ , would be bound third\nin a volume beginning with something by St. Cyprian. There the same treatise\nwould be “ex Cypriano.” This is but one prolific source of ‘authorship’\nattributions, which cause one and the same text to be referred to by a variety\nof names.\n\nThere is another circumstance, much too often forgotten, which greatly adds to\nthe confusion. To the medieval scholar the question: Who wrote this book?\nwould not necessarily or even primarily mean: Who composed this book? It might\nconvey that the inquiry was for the identity of the scribe not of the author.\nAnd this would often be a much easier question to answer, for in any abbey the\ncharacteristic hand of a brother who wrote many fine books did remain\ntraditionally familiar for generations.\n\n### The medieval book trade was a secondhand trade even as with the dealing\ntoday in **OLD MASTERS**.\n\nThen, from the twelfth century onwards the rise of the universities brought\nmasters and students into the field of book production in class time, and\nthese books found their way back to the monastic libraries when students\nreturned after completing their studies: “A number of these standard\ntextbooks, of which approved exemplars were kept for copying by the\nstationarii of the universities, naturally found their way into print quite\nearly, for many of them continued in undiminished request in the fifteenth\ncentury as before. These official university texts offer no problems of origin\nor nomenclature …” ([p. 102](ch02.html#page_102)) Goldschmidt then adds, “Soon\nafter 1300 the expensive vellum could be dispensed with and the cheaper paper\nmade the accumulation of many books a matter of industry rather than of\nwealth.” Since, however, the student went to lectures pen in hand and “it was\nthe lecturer’s task to dictate the book he was expounding to his audience,”\nthere is a great body of these _reportata_ which constitute a very complex\nproblem for editors.[37](ch02a_fn34.html#ch02a_fn34fn37)\n\nCircumstances such as these described by Goldschmidt serve to illustrate the\nextent of the Gutenberg revolution which made possible uniform and repeatable\ntexts:\n\nIt cannot be doubted that for many medieval writers the exact point at which\nthey ceased to be “scribes” and became “authors” was not at all clear. What\namount of ‘comportation’ of acquired information entitled a man to claim the\nstanding of an ‘author’ of a new unit in the chain of transmitted knowledge?\nWe are guilty of an anachronism if we imagine that the medieval student\nregarded the contents of the books he read as the expression of another man’s\npersonality and opinion. He looked upon them as part of that great and total\nbody of knowledge, the _scientia de omni scibili_ , which had once been the\nproperty of the ancient sages. Whatever he read in a venerable old book he\nwould take to be not somebody’s assertion but a small piece of knowledge\nacquired by someone long ago from someone else still more ancient. ([p.\n113](ch02.html#page_113))\n\nNot only were users of manuscripts, writes Goldschmidt, mostly indifferent to\nthe chronology of authorship and to the “identity and personality of the\nauthor of the book he was reading, or in the exact period at which this\nparticular piece of information was written down, equally little did he expect\nhis future readers to be interested in himself.” ([p.\n114](ch02.html#page_114)) In the same way we do not concern ourselves with the\nauthors of the multiplication table or with the personal lives of natural\nscientists. And so it was also when the student undertook to “imitate” the\nstyle of ancient writers.\n\nPerhaps enough has been said about the nature of manuscript culture to\nilluminate the drastic changes in the relation of author to author and of\nauthor to reader in the Gutenberg years ahead. When the “higher critics” began\nto explain the nature of manuscript culture to the Bible-reading public in the\nlater nineteenth century, it seemed to many educated people that the Bible was\nfinished. But these people had lived mainly with the illusions of the Bible\nproduced by print technology. The scriptures had had none of that uniform and\nhomogeneous character during the centuries before Gutenberg. It was, above\nall, the concept of homogeneity, which typography fosters in every phase of\nhuman sensibility, that began to invade the arts, the sciences, industry, and\npolitics from the sixteenth century forward.\n\nBut lest it be inferred that this effect of print culture is a “bad thing,”\nlet us consider rather that homogeneity is quite incompatible with electronic\nculture. We now live in the early part of an age for which the meaning of\nprint culture is becoming as alien as the meaning of manuscript culture was to\nthe eighteenth century. “We are the primitives of a new culture,” said\nBoccioni the sculptor in 1911. Far from wishing to belittle the Gutenberg\nmechanical culture, it seems to me that we must now work very hard to retain\nits achieved values. For the electronic age, as de Chardin insisted, is not\nmechanical but organic, and has little sympathy with the values achieved\nthrough typography, “this mechanical way of writing” (_ars artificialiter\nscribendi_), as it was called at first.\n\n### Until more than two centuries after printing nobody discovered how to\nmaintain a single tone or attitude throughout a prose composition.\n\nOnce ensconced in the unified pictorial space of Gutenberg culture, many\nthings which were in fact utter novelties began to be generalized as holding\nalso for the pre-print author and reader. “Scholarship” consists very much in\ngetting rid of such irrelevant assumptions. Thus the nineteenth-century\neditions of Shakespeare have become a sort of monument to irrelevant\nassumptions. Their editors had little idea that punctuation in 1623 and\nearlier was for the ear and not for the eye.\n\nUntil Addison, as we shall see, the author felt little pressure to maintain a\nsingle attitude to his subject or a consistent tone to the reader. In short,\nprose remained oral rather than visual for centuries after printing. Instead\nof homogeneity there was heterogeneity of tone and attitude, so that the\nauthor felt able to shift these in mid-sentence at any time, just as in\npoetry.[38](ch02a_fn35.html#ch02a_fn35fn38) It was disturbing to scholars to\ndiscover in recent years that Chaucer’s personal pronoun or his “poetic self”\nas narrator was not a consistent _persona._ The “I” of medieval narrative did\nnot provide a point of view so much as immediacy of effect. In the same way\ngrammatical tenses and syntax were managed by medieval writers, not with an\nidea to sequence in time or in space, but to indicate importance of\nstress.[39](ch02a_fn35.html#ch02a_fn35fn39)\n\nE. T. Donaldson writing on “Chaucer the\nPilgrim,”[40](ch02a_fn35.html#ch02a_fn35fn40) says, regarding Chaucer the\nPilgrim, Chaucer the Poet, and Chaucer the Man: “The fact that there are three\nseparate entities does not naturally exclude the probability – or rather the\ncertainty – that they bore a closer resemblance to one another, and that,\nindeed, they frequently got together in the same body. But that does not\nexcuse us from keeping them distinct from one another, difficult as their\nclose resemblance makes our task.”\n\nThere simply was no available exemplar for author or man of letters in the\nfirst age of print, and Aretino, Erasmus, and More were, like Nashe,\nShakespeare, and Swift later on, led to adopt in varying degrees the only\navailable soothsayer mask, that of the medieval clown. Looking for the “point\nof view” of Erasmus or Machiavelli builds up a sense of their\n“inscrutability.” Arnold’s sonnet to Shakespeare is a useful point of\nreference for anybody who needs to observe the literary man baffled by the\nnon-literary.\n\nIt was some time after printing began that authors or readers discovered\n“points of view.” Earlier, it was shown how Milton was the first to introduce\nvisual perspective into poetry, and his work had to wait till the eighteenth\ncentury for acceptance. For the world of visual perspective is one of unified\nand homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of\nspoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of\nGutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.\n\n### Later medieval visual stress muddied liturgical piety as much as\nelectronicfield pressure has clarified it today.\n\nOne massive area to which scholars have turned recently is that of history of\nChristian liturgy. In an article on “Liturgy and Spiritual Personalism” in\n_Worship_ (October, 1960, p. 494) Thomas Merton points out:\n\nLiturgy is, in the original and classical sense of the word, a _political_\nactivity. _Leitourgeia_ was “a public work,” a contribution made by a free\ncitizen of the _polis._ As such, it was distinct from the economic activity or\nthe private and more material concern of making a living and managing the\nproductive enterprises of the “household” … Private life was properly the\nrealm of those who were not fully “persons”, like women, children and slaves,\nwhose appearance in public was without significance because they had no\nability to participate in the life of the city.\n\n_The Liturgical Piety_ of Louis Bouyer considers the later Middle Ages to have\nbeen quite decadent liturgically and to have already begun the translation of\ncorporate prayer and worship into those visual terms that are so inseparable\nfrom Gutenberg technology. On [page 16](ch02.html#page_16), we read:\n\nDom Herwegen’s ideas on this point greatly shocked most of his early readers.\nBut it must be admitted today that the whole tendency of contemporary research\ntends to bear out his conclusions, and to prove them even more convincingly\nthan, perhaps, he himself would have expected. In the greatest scholarly work\nof our times on the history of the Roman Mass, Jungmann’s _Missarum Sollemnia_\n, an overwhelming weight of evidence goes to show that the history of the\nRoman Mass during the Middle Ages is the history of how it came to be\nincreasingly misunderstood by the clergy as well as by the Faithful, and of\nhow it began to disintegrate through the fault of the medieval liturgists\nthemselves. A prominent feature of that process as Father Jungmann’s book\nshows, was the appearance, in the medieval _Expositiones Missae_ , of those\nwrong conceptions we have already discussed: disproportionate emphasis on the\nPresence in the Holy Eucharist and a very sentimental notion of that Presence,\nwhich came to play so disastrous a part in the worship of the Romantic as well\nas the Baroque period.\n\nWith regard only to our new electronic technology, it might baffle many to\nexplain why there should be such a profound liturgical revival in our time,\nunless they were aware of the essentially oral character of the electric\n“field.” Today there is a “High Church” movement within Presbyterianism as\nwell as in many other sects. The merely individual and visual aspects of\nworship no longer satisfy. But here our concern is to understand how before\ntypography there was already a powerful drive towards the visual organization\nof the non-visual. There grew up in the Catholic world a segmenting and also\nsentimental approach in which, writes Bouyer ([p. 16](ch02.html#page_16)), “it\nwas taken for granted that the Mass was meant to reproduce the Passion by a\nkind of mimetic reproduction, each action of the mass representing some action\nof the Passion itself: – for example, the priest’s moving from the Epistle\nside of the altar to the Gospel side being a representation of Jesus’ journey\nfrom Pilate to Herod …”\n\nIt is plain that there was in liturgy precisely the same drive towards\ncinematic reconstruction by visual segmentation that we have seen in\nHuizinga’s story of _The Waning of the Middle Ages_ and in the Italian princes\nand their great Hollywood sets of antiquity. And segmentation equals\nsentimentality. The isolation of the sense of sight quickly led to the\nisolation of one emotion from another, which is sentimentality.\n“Sophistication” today is a negative version of sentimentality, in which\nconventionally appropriate feelings are simply anesthetized. But the due\ninterplay of the emotions is not unrelated to synesthesia or interplay of the\nsenses. So that Huizinga is quite justified in opening his story of the later\nMiddle Ages as a period of emotional violence and decay, as well as a period\nof intense visual stress. Separation of the senses would be sensuality, as the\nseparation of the emotions is sentimentality. Bouyer nowhere refers to the\noperation of typography in affecting Renaissance sensibility. But his entire\nbook is a valid companion for the student of the Gutenberg revolution. He does\nnote ([p. 6](ch01.html#page_6)) of this period that “it craved the super-human\ninstead of the supernatural, as witness the paintings of Michaelangelo; and it\ntook pleasure in the enormous rather than in the great, as witness the statues\nof St. John Lateran with their hysterical gesticulations, and the tomb of\nAlexander VII in St. Peter’s.”\n\nPrint as an immediate technological extension of the human person gave its\nfirst age an unprecedented access of power and vehemence. Visually, print is\nvery much more “high definition” than manuscript. Print was, that is to say, a\nvery “hot” medium coming into a world that for thousands of years had been\nserved by the “cool” medium of script. Thus our own “roaring twenties” were\nthe first to feel the hot movie medium and also the hot radio medium. It was\nthe first great consumer age. So with print Europe experienced its first\nconsumer phase, for not only is print a consumer medium and commodity, but it\ntaught men how to organize all other activities on a systematic lineal basis.\nIt showed men how to create markets and national armies. For the hot medium of\nprint enabled men to _see_ their vernaculars for the first time, and to\nvisualize national unity and power in terms of the vernacular bounds: “We must\nbe free or die who speak the tongue that Shakespeare spake.” Inseparable from\na nationalism of homogeneous English or French speakers was individualism. We\nshall discuss this later. But a visually homogeneous mass consists of\nindividuals in a new subjective sense. Bouyer cites ([p.\n17](ch02.html#page_17)) the medieval turn from objective to subjective piety:\n“This tendency goes along with a shift of emphasis from a union of the whole\nchurch with God to an emphasis on the union of the individual soul with Him.”\n\nA Catholic liturgist like Bouyer, quite unconcerned with segmental practices\nsuch as private interpretation of the Bible, sees, however, the same\nfragmenting tendency in “the insistence of priests on having each a separate\ncelebration of his own, when it is not needed for the people,” for this “tends\nonly to obscure and break that unity of the Church which is not a detail of\nsecondary importance in the Eucharist, but its own proper end.” Once Catholic\nscholarship had transcended the idea of the Middle Ages as “the Christian era\n_par excellence_ , and [the idea] that their civilization and culture provided\nthe outstanding example of a Catholic ideal incarnated in earthly realities,\nit became easy to see that the medieval period in fact paved the way for the\nabandonment of the liturgy by Protestantism and its final disgrace and neglect\nin so much of post-Tridentine Catholicism.” ([p. 15](ch02.html#page_15))\n\nExamining later, how medieval piety is a progressive alienation of the people\nfrom the liturgy, in the interest of grand visual effects, Bouyer ([p.\n249](ch02b.html#page_249)) feels great sympathy with the Protestant reformers\nwho missed the real opportunity for inclusive reform in favour of exclusive\nsegmentation:\n\nThis is true not only because the Reformers reacted against the extreme\ntransformations of traditional piety which had been progressively achieved by\nthese novelties, but also for the reason that had Protestantism been such a\nreaction through and through, in fact as well as in precept, it could have\nbecome a true reformation instead. But Protestantism is much more truly the\nproduct of medieval piety because it is the fruit of what lay in that piety in\nseed-form: a naturalistic outlook on religion, a systematic ignoring of the\nMystery, a sentimental kind of religious “experience” in place of the sober\nmysticism, completely grounded on faith, of the great Christian tradition.\n\nIt is not the aim of this book to do more than to explain the configuration or\ngalaxy of events and actions associated with Gutenberg technology. And rather\nthan speak of “the rise of Protestantism” as a result of typography with its\ninnovation of the visual text – the same for all – in place of the oral word,\nit is more helpful to note how the liturgy of the Catholic Church itself still\ncarries deep marks of the effects of visual technology and the break-up of the\nunity of the senses. “The Elizabethan world picture” was to become much more\nvisually hierarchical than anything medieval had ever been, if only because\nhierarchy came to be merely visual. Bouyer points ([p.\n155](ch02a.html#page_155)) to the inadequacy of visualizing “hierarchy”: “The\nhierarchy is a hierarchy of ministries (services); according to Christ’s word,\nhe who is the high priest among his brethren should be the man who, like\nChrist himself, stands out more perfectly than anyone else, as the Lord’s\nServant.” And as the Catholic tendency in the past had been the splitting up\nof sacraments and the visualizing of functions, the present liturgical revival\nseeks an inclusive rather than an exclusive unity ([p.\n253](ch02b.html#page_253)):\n\nThis means that the first and fundamental condition for any liturgical revival\nwhich is truly a revival of piety must be a personal knowledge of the whole\nBible and meditation on it, both to be achieved along the lines laid out for\nus by the liturgy; such a revival implies a full acceptance of the Bible as\nthe Word of God, and as the framework and ever-living source of all authentic\nChristianity. The monks of the Middle Ages remained alive to the liturgy for\nso long a time only because, in spite of their own defects, they held so\npersistently to this biblical way of accepting Christianity, of meditating on\nits truths and of living in them.\n\nAllusion to the changing patterns of liturgical worship in the twentieth\ncentury will recall to some readers the parallel changes in the world of\nmanagement and of industrial organization. What occurs at the opening of _King\nLear_ in regard to the delegation of the king’s authority and functions is now\nin a reverse phase in the electronic age. Dr. B. J. Muller-Thym, leading\nbusiness analyst, states:[41](ch02a_fn36.html#ch02a_fn36fn41)\n\nThe older, many-layered, highly functionalized organizations were\ncharacterized by the separation of thinking from doing; thinking was generally\nallocated to the top rather than the bottom of the pyramid and to “staff” as\nagainst “line” components. Whatever the wishes of the company about the\ndecentralized exercises of authority, authority inexorably gravitated toward\nthe top of the structure. There was created a numerous middle management\nclass, spread over an indefinite number of supervisory layers whose actual\nroles, as many work studies showed, was predominantly the passing of\ninformation through the system.\n\nIn our electronic age the specialist and pyramidal forms of structure, which\nachieved vogue in the sixteenth century and later, are not any longer\npractical:\n\nThe first thing to be discovered was that pyramidal organizational structures,\nwith many layers of supervision, and with functional division by specialty,\nsimply did not work. The communication chain between top scientific or\nengineering leadership and work centers was too long for either the scientific\nor managerial message to be communicated. But in these research organizations\nwhere work actually got done, when one studied them he found that whatever the\norganization chart prescribed, groups of researchers with different\ncompetences as required by the problem in hand were working together, cutting\nacross organizational lines; that they were establishing most of their own\ndesign criteria for the work as well as their intended patterns of\nassociation; that the patterns of their group association at work followed the\norganization of their competences as human knowledges.\n\nThe “simultaneous field” of electric information structures, today\nreconstitutes the conditions and need for dialogue and participation, rather\nthan specialism and private initiative in all levels of social experience. Our\npresent involvement in these new kinds of interdependence produces in many an\ninvoluntary alienation from our Renaissance heritage. But for the readers of\nthis book it is hoped that we can deepen our understanding both of the\ntypographic and the electronic revolutions.\n\n### The **INTERFACE** of the Renaissance was the meeting of medieval pluralism\nand modern homogeneity and mechanism – a formula for blitz and metamorphosis.\n\nAn age in rapid transition is one which exists on the frontier between two\ncultures and between conflicting technologies. Every moment of its\nconsciousness is an act of translation of each of these cultures into the\nother. Today we live on the frontier between five centuries of mechanism and\nthe new electronics, between the homogeneous and the simultaneous. It is\npainful but fruitful. The sixteenth century Renaissance was an age on the\nfrontier between two thousand years of alphabetic and manuscript culture, on\nthe one hand, and the new mechanism of repeatability and quantification, on\nthe other. It would have been strange, indeed, if the age had not approached\nthe new in terms of what it had learned from the old. This matter is well\nunderstood by psychologists today as can be found in such a handbook as _The\nPsychology of Human Learning_ by John A. McGeoch. He says (p. 394): “The\ninfluence of prior learning (retained until the present) upon the learning of,\nresponse to, new material has traditionally been called _transfer of\nlearning”_. Mostly, transfer effect is quite subliminal. But overt or\nconscious transfer can occur. We have seen some of both kinds of transfer at\nthe beginning of this book where the response of African natives to alphabet\nand film was discussed. Our own Western response to new media like film and\nradio and TV, has been overtly a book culture response to the “challenge.” But\nthe actual _transfer of learning_ and change in mental process and attitude of\nmind that has occurred has been almost entirely subliminal. What we acquire as\na system of sensibility by our mother tongue will affect our ability in\nlearning other languages, verbal or symbolic. That is perhaps why the highly\nliterate Westerner steeped in the lineal and homogeneous modes of print\nculture has much trouble with the non-visual world of modern mathematics and\nphysics. The “backward” or audile-tactile countries have a great advantage\nhere.\n\nAnother basic advantage of cultural clash and transition is that people on the\nfrontier between different modes of experience develop a great power of\ngeneralization. McGeoch says (p. 396): “Generalization, likewise, is a form of\ntransfer, whether at the comparatively elementary level of conditioned\nresponses … or at the complex level of abstract scientific generalization,\nwhere a single statement sums up a myriad of particulars.”\n\nWe can generalize this statement at once by pointing out that the mature phase\nof print culture which proceeds by segmenting and homogenizing situations will\nnot favour the interplay between fields and disciplines such as characterized\nthe first age of print. When print was new it stood as a challenge to the old\nworld of manuscript culture. When the manuscript had faded and print was\nsupreme, there was no more interplay or dialogue but there were many “points\nof view.” There is, however, one massive aspect of the “transfer of training”\nthat occurred with the Gutenberg technology that is stressed throughout the\nwork of Febvre and Martin (_L’Apparition du livre_). It is that during the\nfirst two centuries of print, until the end of the seventeenth century, the\ngreat body of printed matter was of medieval origin. The sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries saw more of the Middle Ages than had ever been available\nto anybody in the Middle Ages. Then it had been scattered and inaccessible and\nslow to read. Now it became privately portable and quick to read. As today,\nthe insatiable needs of TV have brought down upon us the backlog of the old\nmovies, so the needs of the new presses could only be met by the old\nmanuscripts. Moreover, the reading public was atuned to this earlier culture.\nNot only were there no modern writers at first, but they had no public ready\nto accept them so Febvre and Martin say (p. 420): “Thus print facilitated the\nwork of scholars in some fields, but on the whole one can say that it\ncontributed nothing to hasten the adoption of theories or new\nknowledge.”[42](ch02a_fn37.html#ch02a_fn37fn42)\n\nThis, of course, is to consider only the “content” of new theories, and to\nignore the role of print in providing new models for such theories, and in\nprocessing new publics to accept them. Looked at merely from the “content”\npoint of view the achievement of print is modest indeed: “Already in the\nfifteenth century fine editions of classical texts coming off the Italian\npresses, Venetian and Milanese in particular, … had begun to make better known\nsuch authors of antiquity as the Middle Ages had not forgotten …” (p. 400)\n\nBut the tiny public for these humanist offerings should not obscure the real\nwork of the early age of print. Febvre and Martin (p. 383) see it thus:\n\nTo render the Bible directly accessible to a larger number of readers, not\nonly in Latin but also in the vernacular, to furnish to students and teachers\nat the universities the major treatises in the traditional scholastic arsenal,\nto multiply above all the common books, breviaries, book of hours necessary\nfor the practice of liturgical ceremonies and daily prayers, the writings of\nthe mystical writers and books of popular piety, to render, above all, the\nreading of these works more easily accessible to a very large public, such was\none of the principal tasks of print in its beginnings.\n\nThe largest public by far was for the medieval romances of chivalry, almanacs\n(shepherds’ calendars) and, above all, illustrated books of hours. Of the\npenetrating force of printing in the shaping of market and capital\norganization, Febvre and Martin have much to say. For the moment, it is\nrelevant to bring out here their stress on the early effort of the printers to\nattain “homogenéité de la page” in spite of poor equilibrium of types, and “in\nspite of defective fonts and in spite of precarious lineality.” It is\nprecisely these new effects which were still insecure that would strike the\nage as having the utmost charge of meaning and novelty of achievement.\nHomogeneity and lineality are the formulas for the new science and art of the\nRenaissance. For the infinitesimal calculus, as a means of quantifying forces\nand spaces, depends as much on the fiction of homogeneous particles as\nperspective depends upon the illusion of the third dimension on flat surfaces.\n\nThe student of the work of St. Thomas More knows how frequently More\nconfronted the new passion for homogeneity in the sectaries of his day. We are\nhere concerned not with theology but only the new psychic demand for\nhomogeneity, no matter in what field. This is from “A letter of Sir Thomas\nMore, Knight, impugning the erroneous writings of John Frith against the\nBlessed Sacrament of the Altar.”[43](ch02a_fn38.html#ch02a_fn38fn43)\n\nIf he sayd that the wordes of Chryste might beside the lyttarall sence bee\nvnderstanden in an allegorye, I would wel agre wyth him. For so may euery\nworde almost through the whole scripture, calling an allegory euerye-sense,\nwherby the wordes be translated vnto some other spirituall vnderstanding,\nbeside the true playne open sence that ye letter firste entended. But on the\nother side because yt in some wordes of scrypture is there none other thing\nentended but an allegorye, to goe therfore and in another place of scripture\nto take away wyth an allegory, the very true litteral sense as he doth here,\nthys is the faute that we fynde in hym. Whych if it may be suffered, must\nnedes make al ye scripture as touching anye poynte of oure fayth, of none\neffecte or force at all. I meruaile me therfore much that he is not aferde to\naffirme that these wordes of Christe, of his bodye and hys bloode, must needes\nbe vnderstanden onely by way of a similitude or an allegory as ye wordes be of\nthe vine and the dore.\n\nNow this he woteth well, yt thoughe some woordes spoken by the mouthe of\nChrist written in scripture, be to be vnderstanden only by way of a similitude\nor an allegory: it foloweth not therupõ that of necessitye euerye like woorde\nof Christ in other places was none other but an allegory.\n\nMore is saying that Frith understands the whole of Scripture to be continuous,\nuniform, and homogeneous space, exactly as in the new painting of the time.\nThe new homogeneity of the printed page seemed to inspire a subliminal faith\nin the validity of the printed Bible as bypassing the traditional oral\nauthority of the Church, on one hand, and the need for rational critical\nscholarship on the other. It was as if print, uniform and repeatable commodity\nthat it was, had the power of creating a new hypnotic superstition of the book\nas independent of and uncontaminated by human agency. Nobody who had read\nmanuscripts could achieve this state of mind concerning the nature of the\nwritten word. But the assumption of homogeneous repeatability derived from the\nprinted page, when extended to all the other concerns of life, led gradually\nto all those forms of production and social organization from which the\nWestern world derives many satisfactions and nearly all of its characteristic\ntraits.\n\n### Peter Ramus and John Dewey were the two educational **SURFERS** or wave-\nriders of antithetic periods, the Gutenberg and the Marconi or electronic.\n\nIn our time John Dewey worked to restore education to its primitive, pre-print\nphase. He wanted to get the student out of the passive role of consumer of\nuniformly packaged learning. In fact, Dewey in reacting against passive print\nculture was surf-boarding along on the new electronic wave. That wave has now\nrolled right over this age. In the sixteenth century the great figure in\neducational reform was Peter Ramus (1515–1572), a Frenchman who rode the\nGutenberg wave. Walter Ong has finally given us adequate studies of Ramus,\nplacing him in relation to the later scholasticism from which he came and in\nrelation to the new print-oriented classrooms for which he devised his visual\nprograms. The printed book was a new visual aid available to all students and\nit rendered the older education obsolete. The book was literally a teaching\nmachine where the manuscript was a crude teaching tool only.\n\nHad any of our current testers of media and various educational aids been\navailable to the harassed sixteenth century administrator they would have been\nasked to find out whether the new teaching machine, the printed book, could do\nthe full educational job. Could a portable, private instrument like the new\nbook take the place of the book one made by hand and memorized as one made it?\nCould a book which could be read quickly and even silently take the place of a\nbook read slowly aloud? Could students trained by such printed books measure\nup to the skilled orators and disputants produced by manuscript means? Using\nthe methods the testers now use for radio, film, and TV, our testers would\nhave reported in due course: “Yes, strange and repugnant as it may sound to\nyou, the new teaching machines enable students to learn as much as before.\nMoreover, they seem to have more confidence in the new method as giving them\nthe means of acquiring many new kinds of knowledge.”\n\nThe testers, that is to say, would have entirely missed the character of the\nnew machine. They would have offered not one clue to its effects. There is no\nneed to speculate about this situation. There is a recent work which attempts\nto assess these effects: _Television in the Lives of Our Children_ by Wilbur\nSchramm, Jack Lyle, and Edwin B. Parker. When we see the reason for the total\nfailure of this book to get in touch with its announced theme, we can\nunderstand why in the sixteenth century men had no clue to the nature and\neffects of the printed word. Schramm and his colleagues make no analysis of\nthe TV image. They assume that apart from the “program” or “content” TV is a\n“neutral” medium like any other. To know otherwise, these men would have to\nhave a thorough knowledge of the various art forms and scientific models of\nthe past century. In the same way nobody could discover anything about the\nnature or effect of print without careful study of Renaissance painting and\nthe new scientific models.\n\nBut there is one especially revealing assumption made by Schramm and his\ncolleagues. It is one that they share with Don Quixote, and it is that print\nis the criterion of “reality.” Schramm assumes ([p. 106](ch02.html#page_106))\nthat the non-print media are “fantasy”-oriented: “Looking at these children in\nanother way, 75% of the highest socioeconomic group were high users of print.\n… whereas the lowest socioeconomic children were more likely to depend on\ntelevision, and television alone.”\n\nSince print is of such importance as a parameter or frame of reference to\npeople like Schramm in their scientific testing, we had best get on with\nfinding out what it is and does. And that is where the work of Ramus can help\nus a lot. For just as Dewey, in a very confused way, was trying to explain the\nmeaning of the electronic age to educators, Ramus had a new program for all\nphases of education in the sixteenth century. Father Ong at the end of a\nrecent article on “Ramist Classroom Procedure and the Nature of\nReality”[44](ch02a_fn39.html#ch02a_fn39fn44) says that for Ramus and his\nfollowers, it is their version of the school curriculum which holds the world\ntogether. “Nothing is accessible for ‘use’ … until it has first been put\nthrough the curriculum. The schoolroom is by implication the doorway to\nreality, and indeed the only doorway.” Now that idea, new in the sixteenth\ncentury, is the one that Schramm has been saddled with, unconsciously, in the\ntwentieth. Dewey, on the other hand, is the perfect foil to Ramus in his\nstriving to dislodge the school from the fantastic Ramist idea of it as\nimmediate adjunct to the press and as the supreme processer or hopper through\nwhich the young and all their experience must pass in order to be available\nfor “use.” Ramus was entirely right in his insistence on the supremacy of the\nnew printed book in the classroom. For only there could the homogenizing\neffects of the new medium be given heavy stress in young lives. Students\nprocessed by print technology in this way would be able to translate every\nkind of problem and experience into the new visual kind of lineal order. For a\nnationalist society keen on exploiting its entire manpower for the common\ntasks of commerce and finance, of production and marketing, it needed very\nlittle vision to see that education of this kind should be compulsory. Without\nuniversal literacy it is hard, indeed, to tap the manpower pool. Napoleon had\ngreat trouble in getting peasants and semi-literates to march and drill, and\ntook to tying their feet with 18-inch lengths of rope to give them the\nnecessary sense of precision, uniformity and repeatability. But the fuller\ndevelopment of manpower resources by literacy in the nineteenth century had to\nwait for the intervening commercial and industrial applications of print\ntechnology, to all phases of learning, work, and entertainment.\n\n### Rabelais offers a vision of the future of print culture as\n\na consumer’s paradise of applied knowledge.\n\nAnybody who looks at the Gutenberg question at all, runs very soon into\nGargantua’s Letter to Pantagruel. Rabelais, long before Cervantes, produced an\nauthentic myth or prefiguration of the whole complex of print technology. The\nCadmus myth that the sowing of the dragon’s teeth, or the letters of the\nalphabet, by King Cadmus, caused armed men to spring up is a concise and\naccurate oral myth. As befits the medium of print, Rabelais is a verbose mass-\nproduction entertainment. But his vision of giganticism and the consumer’s\nparadises ahead was quite accurate. There are, indeed, four massive myths of\nthe Gutenberg transformation of society. Besides _Gargantua_ , they are _Don\nQuixote_ , the _Dunciad_ , and _Finnegans Wake._ Each of them deserves a\nseparate volume in relation to the world of typography, but some attention\nwill be given to each in the following pages.\n\nIf we first take a moment to glance at mechanization in its advanced stages it\nwill be easier to see what Rabelais was excited about in its earlier phase. In\nhis study of the democratization of the privileged consumer commodities,\n_Mechanization Takes Command_ , Siegfried Giedion considers the meaning of the\nassembly-line in its explicit later phases (p. 457):\n\nEight years later, in 1865, Pullman’s sleeping car, the _Pioneer_ , began to\ndemocratize aristocratic luxury. Pullman possessed the same instinct as Henry\nFord half a century later, for stirring the dormant fancies of the public\nuntil they grew into demands. Both careers centered round the same problem:\nHow might the instruments of comfort, that in Europe were unquestionably\nreserved to the financially privileged class, become democratized?\n\nRabelais is concerned with the democratization of knowledge by the abundance\nof wines from the printing press. For the press is named from the technology\nit borrowed from the wine-press. Applied knowledge from the press led\neventually to comfort as much as to learning.\n\nIf there is any doubt whether the Cadmus myth uses “dragon’s teeth” as an\nallusion to the technology of the hieroglyph, there need be none at all about\nRabelais’s insistence on _pantagruelion_ as the symbol and image of printing\nfrom movable types. For this is the name of the hemp plant from which rope was\nmade. From the teasing and shredding and weaving of this plant there came the\nlineal cords and bonds of greatest social enterprises. And Rabelais had a\nvision of the entire “world in Pantagruel’s mouth,” which is quite literally\nthe idea of the giganticism that issues from mere additive association of\nhomogeneous parts. And again his vision was accurate as we in this century can\neasily testify by retrospect. It is in his letter to Pantagruel at Paris that\nGargantua proclaims the praise of typography:\n\nNow is it that the minds of men are qualified with all manner of discipline,\nand the old sciences revived, which for many ages were extinct: now it is,\nthat the learned languages are to their Pristine purity restored, _viz._\nGreek, (without which a man may be ashamed to account himself a scholar)\nHebrew, Arabick, Chaldean and Latine. Printing likewise is now in use, so\nelegant, and so correct, that better cannot be imagined, although it was found\nout but in my time by divine inspiration, as by a diabolical suggestion on the\nother side was the invention of Ordnance. All the world is full of knowing\nmen, of most learned Schoolmasters, and vast Libraries: and it appears to me\nas a truth, that neither in Plato’s time nor Cicero’s, nor Papinian’s, there\nwas ever such conveniency for studying, as we see at this day there is. … I\nsee robbers, hangmen, freebooters, tapsters, ostlers, and such like, of the\nvery rubbish of the people, more learned now, than the doctors and the\npreachers were in my time. … What shall I say? The very women and children\nhave aspired to this praise and celestial Manna of good\nlearning.[45](ch02a_fn40.html#ch02a_fn40fn45)\n\nAlthough the main work was done by Cromwell and Napoleon, “ordnance” (or\ncannon) and gunpowder had at least begun the levelling of castles, classes,\nand feudal distinctions. So print, says Rabelais, has begun the homogenizing\nof individuals and of talents. Later in the same century Francis Bacon was\nprophesying that his scientific method would level all talents and enable a\nchild to make scientific discoveries of consequence. And Bacon’s “method” we\nshall see was the extension of the idea of the new printed page to the whole\nencyclopedia of natural phenomena. That is, Bacon’s method literally puts the\nwhole of nature in Pantagruel’s mouth.\n\nAlbert Guérard’s comment on this aspect of Rabelais in _The Life and Death of\nan Ideal_ ([p. 39](ch02.html#page_39)) is as follows:\n\nThis triumphant Pantagruelism inspires the chapters, full of quaint erudition,\npractical knowledge and poetic enthusiasm, which, at the end of the third\nbook, he devotes to the praise of the blessed herb Pantagruelion. Literally,\nPantagruelion is mere hemp; symbolically, it is human industry. Capping the\nwildest achievements of his own times with wilder boast and prophecy, Rabelais\nfirst shows man, by virtue of this Pantagruelion, exploring the remotest\nregions of his globe, “so that Taproban hath seen the heaths of Lapland, and\nboth the Javas, the Riphaean Mountains.” Men “scoured the Atlantic Ocean,\npassed the tropics, pushed through the torrid zone, measured all the Zodiac,\nsported under the equinoctial, having both poles level with their horizon.”\nThen, “all marine and terrestrial gods were on a sudden all afraid.” What is\nto prevent Pantagruel and his children from discovering some still more potent\nherb, by means of which they shall scale the very heavens? Who knows but they\nmay “contrive a way to pierce into the high aerian clouds, and shut and open\nas they please the sluices from whence proceed the floodgates of the rain …\nthen, prosecuting their ethereal voyage, they may step into the lightning\nworkhouse and shop … where, seizing on the magazine of heaven, they may\ndischarge a bouncing peal or two of thundering ordnance for joy of their\narrival at these new supernal places. … And we the Gods shall then not be able\nto resist the impetuosity of their intrusion, … whatever regions, domiciles or\nmansions of the spangled firmament they shall have a mind to see, to stay in,\nor to travel through for their recreation.”\n\nThe Rabelais vision of new means and patterns of human interdependence was a\nvista of power through applied knowledge. The price of conquering the new\nworld of gigantic dimensions was simply to enter Pantagruel’s mouth. Erich\nAuerbach devotes the eleventh chapter of _Mimesis: The Representation of\nReality in Western Literature_ to “The World in Pantagruel’s Mouth.” Auerbach\nnotes ([p. 269](ch02b.html#page_269)) some of the predecessors of Rabelais’\nfantasy in order to do justice to the originality of Rabelais who “maintains a\nconstant interplay of different locales, different themes and different levels\nof style.” Like Robert Burton’s _Anatomy of Melancholy_ later on, Rabelais\nfollows the “principle of the promiscuous intermingling of the categories of\nevent, experience, and knowledge, as well as of dimensions and styles.”\n\nAgain, Rabelais is like a medieval glossator of the Roman law in supporting\nhis absurd opinions with a welter of learning which manifests “rapid shifts\nbetween a multiplicity of viewpoints.” That is to say, Rabelais is a\nscholastic in his mosaic procedures, consciously juxtaposing this ancient\nfarrago with the new individual single-point-of-view technology of print. Like\nthe poet John Skelton at the same time in England, of whom C. S. Lewis writes,\n“Skelton has ceased to be a man and become a\nmob,”[46](ch02a_fn41.html#ch02a_fn41fn46) Rabelais is a collective rout of\noral schoolmen and glossators suddenly debouched into a visual world newly set\nup on individualist and nationalist lines. It is just the incongruity of these\ntwo worlds as they mix and mingle in the very language of Rabelais that gives\nus a special feeling of his relevance for us, who also live ambivalently in\ndivided and distinguished cultures. Two cultures or technologies can, like\nastronomical galaxies, pass through one another without collision; but not\nwithout change of configuration. In modern physics there is, similarly, the\nconcept of “interface” or the meeting and metamorphosis of two structures.\nSuch “interficiality” is the very key to the Renaissance as to our twentieth\ncentury.\n\n### The celebrated earthy\n\ntactility of Rabelais is a massive backwash of receding manuscript culture.\n\nA most significant feature of Rabelais as a man on the frontier between\ncultures, is the way in which the tactile sense in him gets such exaggeration\nas almost to become isolated. This extreme tactility in him advertises his\nmedievalism by consciously splattering it against tidy new visual wall of\nprint culture. John Cowper Powys in his _Rabelais_ puts it this way ([p.\n57](ch02.html#page_57)):\n\nOne exceptional characteristic of Rabelais was his power, a power possessed\nalso by Walt Whitman, of concentrating a tremendous magnetic energy upon the\nenjoyment – almost as if these inanimate elements were responsive to embraces\nand good to eat! – of the solid substances of wood and stone, making these\nthings actually porous, you might say, to planetary desire. This\ncharacteristic was kept in humorous and very positive control; but that when\nso kept it is one of the chief characteristics of a born architect I used to\nbe always finding out from my own brother, A. R. Powys, and his ways with wood\nand stone.\n\nWhat Powys says here of tactility and affinity for wood and stone ties in with\nmuch said earlier about the audile-tactile features of scholasticism and\nGothic architecture. It is in this tactile and audile, and ever so unliterary,\nmode that Rabelais gets his naughty, “earthy” effects. Like James Joyce,\nanother modern master of medieval tactile mosaic, Rabelais expected the public\nto devote its life to study of his work. “I intend each and every reader to\nlay aside his business, to abandon his trade, to relinquish his profession,\nand to concentrate wholly upon my work.” Joyce said the same thing, and like\nRabelais, was free with the new medium in an especial way. For Joyce,\nthroughout _Finnegans Wake_ , television is “the Charge of the Light Brigade,”\nand the whole world is comprised in a single book.\n\nIn addition Rabelais gives the reader a good tactile drubbing:\n\nAnd therefore, to make an end of this Prologue, even as I give my selfe to an\nhundred Pannier-fulls of faire devils, body and soul, tripes and guts, in case\nthat I lie so much as one single word in this History, after the like manner\nSt. Anthonies fire burn you, Mahoom’s disease whirle you, the squinance with a\nstitch in your side and the Wolfe in your stomack trusse you, the bloody Flux\nseize upon you, the curst sharp inflammations of wilde fire, as slender and\nthin as Cowes haire, strengthened with quick silver, enter into your\nFundament, and like those of Sodom and Gomorrha, may you fall into sulphur,\nfire and bottomless pits in case you do not firmly beleeve all that I shall\nrelate unto you in this present Chronicle.\n\n### Typography as the first mechanization of a handicraft is itself the\nperfect instance not of a new knowledge, but of applied knowledge.\n\nBut the amazing splitting away of the tactile quality in language appears as\nan extreme development of this quality in Rabelais and some Elizabethans like\nNashe. Then it divides steadily from language until Hopkins and the symbolists\nbegan to work at it in the nineteenth century. The point in all this will\nappear more plainly when we turn to the sixteenth century obsession with\nquantification. For number and measure are the mode of the tactile, and they\nare soon to be found departing from the visual humanist camp of letters. A\ngreat divorce between number, the language of science, and letters, the\nlanguage of civilization, occurred in the later Renaissance. But the earlier\nphase of this divorce, as we shall see, was the Ramist method for “use” and\napplied knowledge by means of printed literature. For it cannot be\nsufficiently explained that the mechanization of the ancient handicraft of the\nscribe was itself “applied” knowledge. And the application consisted in the\nvisual arresting and splitting up of the scribal action. That is why, once\nthis solution to the problem of mechanization was worked out, it could be\nextended to the mechanizing of many other actions. Moreover, the mere\naccustomation to the repetitive, lineal patterns of the printed page strongly\ndisposed people to transfer such approaches to all kinds of problems. Febvre\nand Martin say in _L’Apparition du livre_ ([p. 28](ch02.html#page_28)), for\nexample, that a great spur was applied to paper manufacture as early as the\neleventh century by the discovery of a method which transformed “le movement\ncirculaire en movement alternatif.” The change was from mill to mallets, much\nlike the shift from periodic Ciceronian prose to Senecan “cutted period” at\nthe same time. A change from mill to mallets implies the breaking up of\ncontinuous into segmental operations, and the authors add: “This invention had\nbeen the origin of numerous industrial upsets.” And print, which was to be the\nmother of all the _bouleversements_ to come, was itself a veritable cluster or\ngalaxy of previously achieved technologies. Usher’s statement in his _History\nof Mechanical Inventions_ ([p. 239](ch02b.html#page_239)) is masterly:\n\nThe entire achievement embodied in the printed book with illustrations\npresents a striking example of the multiplicity of individual acts of\ninvention that are requisite to bring about a new result. In its entirety,\nthis accomplishment involves: the invention of paper and of inks made with an\noil base; the development of engraving on wood and … of wood blocks; the\ndevelopment of the press and the special technique of press work involved in\nprinting.\n\nThe history of paper is in some ways a separate subject, but it must be\nevident that the generalization of printing could not have proceeded\nsignificantly with any other basic medium. Parchment is difficult to handle,\ncostly, and narrowly limited in supply. Books would have remained an article\nof luxury if parchment had been the only available medium of issue. Papyrus is\nhard, brittle, and unsuitable for printing. The introduction of linen-paper\nmaking into Europe from China was thus an important preliminary condition. The\norigin of this product in the Far East and the stages of its transfer overland\nto Europe are now fairly well ascertained, so that the chronology of the\ntransfers is adequately established …\n\nThat printing from movable types was an event nearly related to the earlier\ntechnology of the phonetic alphabet is a fact that has been a main reason for\nstudying all these centuries that preceded Gutenberg. Phonetic script was the\nindispensable prelude. Thus Chinese ideogrammic script proved a complete block\nagainst the development of print technology in their culture. Today when they\nare determined to alphabetize their writing they find that they must also\nbreak up their verbal structures polysyllabically before the phonetic alphabet\nwill apply to them. Reflection on this situation will help us to understand\nwhy alphabetic writing at first, and print later, led to the analytic\nseparation of interpersonal relations and inner and outer functions in the\nWestern world. Thus everywhere in _Finnegans Wake_ Joyce reiterates the theme\nof the effects of the alphabet on “abced-minded man,” ever “whispering his ho\n(here keen again and begin again to make sound sense and sense sound kin\nagain)” ([p. 121](ch02a.html#page_121)) and urges all to “harmonize your\nabecedeed responses” ([p. 140](ch02a.html#page_140)).\n\nThe new oil base for printing came “from the painters rather than the\ncalligraphers,” and “the smaller cloth and wine presses embodied most of the\nfeatures required by the printing press. … the primary problems of innovation\ncentered around the arts of engraving and casting\n…”[47](ch02a_fn42.html#ch02a_fn42fn47) The goldsmiths and many others were\nneeded to make up the family of inventions that add up to “printing.” So\ncomplex is the story that a query has arisen: “What did Gutenberg invent?”\nUsher says ([p. 247](ch02b.html#page_247)): “Unfortunately, no wholly decisive\nanswer can be given, because we really have no competent contemporary evidence\nas to the details of the processes by which the various early books were\nproduced.” In the same way the Ford company has no record of the actual\nprocedures followed in making its first cars.\n\nThe concern in the present book is to point out the contemporary response to\nthis new technology, as in years to come historians will chart the effects of\nradio on the movie and of TV in disposing people towards the new kinds of\nspace as, for example, of the small car. It seemed quite natural to Rabelais\nto hymn the printed book, product of the new wine press. The following passage\nfrom the disputed “fifth” book of the work would seem, in terms of my\nsuggestion about the dominant continuing metaphor of the new printing press in\nthe entire conception, to be integral to Rabelais.\n\nBottle whose Mysterious Deep  \nDoes ten thousand secrets keep,  \nWith attentive ear I wait;  \nEase my Mind and speak my Fate,  \nSoul of joy. Like Bacchus, we  \nMore than India gain by thee.  \nTruths unborn thy juice reveals,  \nWhich Futurity conceals.  \nAntidote to Frauds and Lies,  \nWine that mounts up to the skies,  \nMay thy Father Noah’s Brood  \nLike him drown, but in thy Flood.  \nSpeak, so may the Liquid Mine  \nOf Rubies, or of Diamonds shine.\n\n### Every technology contrived and **OUTERED** by man has the power to numb\nhuman awareness during the period of its first interiorization.\n\nThat wisdom and knowledge should be distilled from the _press_ seemed an\nobvious metaphor to anybody in the sixteenth century. Just how deeply the\nprinted book was embedded in the preceding culture is made manifest by Curt\nBühler in _The Fifteenth Century Book: the Scribes; the Printers; the\nDecorators._ Bühler tells of the “very considerable number of such\nmanuscripts, copied from printed books” that have survived to our day;\n“Actually, of course, there is very little real difference between the\nfifteenth-century manuscripts and the incunabula – and the student of the\nearliest printing would be well advised if he viewed the new invention, as the\nfirst printers did, as simply another form of writing – in this case,\n“artificialiter scribere.” ([p. 16](ch02.html#page_16)) The “horseless\ncarriage” was for a time in the same ambiguous state as the printed book.\n\nBuhler’s data about the peaceful co-existence between scribe and printer will\nbe new and welcome to many readers:\n\nWhat, then, became of the book-scribes? What happened to the various\ncategories of writers of literary works, who practiced their trade prior to\n1450, once the printing press was established? The professionals previously\nemployed by the large scriptoria seem to have done no more than to change\ntheir titles and thereupon became calligraphers; in any event, they went right\non doing what had been their task for centuries. On the one hand, it should be\nremembered that calligraphers necessarily catered principally, if not\nexclusively, to the “de luxe-bespoke” trade. On the other, it was not apparent\nuntil the very late fifteenth century – or more fully, perhaps, in the\nsixteenth – that calligraphy had turned into an applied art or, at worst, a\nmere hobby. The scriptoria themselves seem to have been unable to compete with\nthe printing firms and the publishing houses which subsequently came into\nbeing – although some managed to survive by becoming booksellers. Their\nemployees, however, enjoyed a variety of alternate choices, in that they could\ncontrive to attach themselves to well-to-do patrons, to carry on a bespoke\ntrade, or to become the itinerant scribes (mostly of Germanic or of Low\nCountry origin) who wandered all over Europe in these years, even working in\nItaly. Some scribes joined forces with the enemy and became printers\nthemselves – though some of those upon whom Fortune did not smile later\nforsook the press and returned to their former occupation. This is rather\nstrong evidence for the belief that a scribe, in the closing years of the\nfifteenth century, could still make a living for himself with his pen. ([pp.\n26](ch02.html#page_26)–7)\n\nUsher has made it plain that the cluster of events and technologies that got\ntogether in the mind and age of Gutenberg is quite opaque. Nobody is today\nprepared to say even what it was that Gutenberg invented. In the laughing\nphrase of Joyce we must “sink deep or touch not the Cartesian spring.” Only in\nour own time have people begun to analyse: “what is a business?” B. J. Muller-\nThym answers that it is a machine for making wealth, successor to the family\nas the wealth-making unit of the pre-industrial ages. G. T. Guilbaud in asking\nthe question _What is Cybernetics?_ refers to the work of Jacques Lafitte,\nengineer and architect, saying ([pp. 9](ch01.html#page_9)–10) that whereas\ntoday nobody doubts “the importance of the study of machines for their own\nsake”\n\n… twenty-five years ago, as Lafitte pointed out in his book, the science of\nmachines did not exist. Elementary fragments of it could be found here and\nthere among the works of engineers, in the writings of philosophers or\nsociologists, in novels or essays – but nothing systematic had so far taken\nshape.\n\n“The _organised_ constructions of man” … these are our machines. From the\nprimitive flint knife to the modern lathe, from the rude shanty to the\nperfected dwellings of the present day, from the simple abacus to the enormous\ncalculating machine – what variety from which to extract common\ncharacteristics and attempt a useful classification! The notion of a machine\nis as hard to define as that of a living organism; a great engineer once spoke\nindeed of an ‘artificial zoology’. But it is not definition or classification\nthat is needed most urgently.\n\nHere is how Lafitte put it: “Because we are their makers, we have too often\ndeluded ourselves into believing that we knew all there was to know about\nmachines. Although the study and construction of machines of all sorts owes\nmuch to advances in mechanics, physics and chemistry, nevertheless mechanology\n– the science of machines as such, the science of the organized constructions\nof man – is not a branch of these sciences. Its place is elsewhere in the\nranks of scientific disciplines.”\n\nIt will seem more and more strange to us why men have chosen to know so little\nabout matters about which they have done so much. Alexander Pope may have\nnoticed this matter ironically when he wrote:\n\nOne science only will one genius fit  \nSo vast is art, so narrow human wit.\n\nFor he well knew that this was the formula for the Tower of Babel. At any\nrate, with the Gutenberg technology we move into the age of the take-off of\nthe machine. The principle of segmentation of actions and functions and roles\nbecame systematically applicable wherever desired. Basically it is the\nprinciple of visual quantification discovered in the later Middle Ages, as\nClagett explained. This principle of translating non-visual matters of motion\nand energy into visual terms is the very principle of “applied” knowledge in\nany time or place. The Gutenberg technology extended this principle to writing\nand language and the codification and transmission of every kind of learning.\n\n### With Gutenberg Europe enters the technological phase of progress, when\nchange itself becomes the archetypal norm of social life.\n\nIn an age which discovered this technique of translation as the means of\n_applied_ knowledge, it is to be expected that it will be found everywhere as\na consciously experienced novelty. Sir Philip Sidney, in his _Defence of\nPoetry_ , felt he had hit upon a quite necessary principle. Whereas the\nphilosopher teaches and the historian gives examples of philosophical\nprinciple, only the poet applies the whole matter to the correction of the\nhuman will and the erection of the human spirit:\n\nNow doth the peerless poet perform both: for whatsoever the philosopher saith\nshould be done, he giveth a perfect picture of it in some one by whom he\npresupposeth it was done; so as he coupleth the general notion with the\nparticular example. A perfect picture I say, for he yieldeth to the powers of\nthe mind an image of that whereof the philosopher bestoweth but a wordish\ndescription: which doth neither strike, pierce, nor possess the sight of the\nsoul so much as that other doth.[48](ch02a_fn43.html#ch02a_fn43fn48)\n\nA more unexpected translation into the new mode appears in a letter of\nDescartes prefacing his _Principles of Philosophy_ : “ … it may first of all\nbe run through in its entirety like a novel, without forcing the attention\nunduly upon it. … It is only necessary to mark with a pen the places where\ndifficulty is found, and continue to read without interruption to the end.”\n\nThe instruction of Descartes to his readers is one of the more explicit\nrecognitions of the change in language and thought resulting from print.\nNamely, that there is no more need, as there had been in oral philosophy, to\nprobe and check each term. The context will now do. The situation is not\nunlike the meeting of two scholars today. When one asks, “How do you use the\nterm ‘tribal’ in that connection?”, the other can say, “Read my article on it\nin the current issue of …” Paradoxically, a close attention to precise nuance\nof word use is an oral and not a written trait. For large, general visual\ncontexts always accompany the printed word. But if print discourages minute\nverbal play, it strongly works for uniformity of spelling and uniformity of\nmeaning, since both of these are immediate practical concerns of the printer\nand his public.\n\nIn the same way, a written philosophy, and especially a printed one, will\nnaturally make “certitude” the primary object of knowledge, just as the\nscholar in a print culture can have acceptance for his accuracy even though he\nhave nothing to say. But the paradox of the passion for certitude in print\nculture is that it must proceed by the method of doubt. We shall find\nabundance of such paradoxes in the new technology that made each book reader\nthe centre of the universe and also enabled Copernicus to toss man to the\nperiphery of the heavens, dislodging him from the centre of the physical\nworld.\n\nEqually paradoxical is the power of print to install the reader in a\nsubjective universe of limitless freedom and spontaneity:\n\nMy mind to me a Kingdom is;  \nSuch perfect joy therein I find  \nThat it excels all other bliss  \nWhich God or Nature hath assigned.\n\nBut by the same token print induces the reader to order his external life and\nactions with visual propriety and rigour, until the appearance of virtue and\nstability usurp all inner motive and\n\nShades of the prison-house begin to close  \nUpon the growing Boy.\n\nThe celebrated “To be or not to be” of Hamlet is the scholastic _sic et non_\nof Abelard translated into the new visual culture where it has a reverse\nsignificance. Under oral scholastic conditions the _sic et non_ is a mode of\nexperiencing the very sinuosities of the dialectical movements of the\ninquiring mind. It corresponds to the verbal sensing of the poetic process in\nDante and the _dolce stil nuovo_. But in Montaigne and Descartes it is not the\nprocess but the product that is sought. And the method of arresting the mind\nby snapshot, which Montaigne calls _la peinture de la pensée_ , is itself the\nmethod of doubt. Hamlet presents two pictures, two _views_ of life. His\nsoliloquy is an indispensable point of reorientation between the old oral and\nnew visual cultures. He concludes with an explicit recognition of the contrast\nbetween the old and the new, putting “conscience” against “resolution”:\n\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution  \nIs sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,  \nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment  \nWith this regard their currents turn awry  \nAnd lose the name of action. (III, i)\n\nThis is the identical division we have already seen in Thomas More’s contrast:\n“Your scholastic philosophy is not unpleasant among friends in familiar\ncommunication, but in the councils of Kings where great matters be debated and\nreasoned with great authority these things have no place.”\n\nHamlet is repeating a commonplace conflict of his century, that between the\nold oral “field” approach to problems and the new visual approach of applied\nor “resolute” knowledge. And “resolution” is the cant or conventional term\nused by the Machiavellians. So the conflict is between “conscience” and\n“resolution,” not in our sense at all, but between an over-all awareness and a\nmerely private point of view. Thus, today the conflict goes the other way. The\nhighly literate and individualist liberal mind is tormented by the pressure to\nbecome collectively oriented. The literate liberal is convinced that all real\nvalues are private, personal, individual. Such is the message of mere\nliteracy. Yet the new electric technology pressures him towards the need for\ntotal human interdependence. Hamlet, on the other hand, saw the advantages of\ncorporate responsibility and awareness (“conscience”) with each man in a\n_role_ , not at his private peephole or “point of view.” Is it not obvious\nthat there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand\non technological grounds?\n\nHaving asked myself this question some time ago, the following feature\nemerged: the printed word is an arrested moment of mental movement. To read\nprint is to act both as movie projector and audience for a mental movie. The\nreader attains a strong feeling of participation in the total motions of a\nmind in the process of thinking. But is it not basically the printed word’s\n“still shot” that fosters a habit of mind which tackles all problems of\nmovement and change in terms of the unmoved segment or section? Has not print\ninspired a hundred different mathematical and analytical procedures for\nexplaining and controlling change in terms of the unchanging? Have we not\ntended to apply this very static feature to print itself and talked only of\nits quantitative effects? Do we not speak more of the power of print to\nincrease knowledge and to extend literacy than the most obvious features of\nsong, dance, painting, perception, poetry, architecture, and town\nplanning?[49](ch02a_fn44.html#ch02a_fn44fn49)\n\nPrint is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or\ndecollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of\nalphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the\nindividuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript\nculture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men\ndecided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology,\nindividualism will also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is\nlike cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. “But,” someone says, “we\ndidn’t know it would happen.” Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is\na problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of\nthe moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for morality.\n\nAs for the technique of doubt in Montaigne and Descartes, it is inseparable,\ntechnologically, as we shall see from the criterion of repeatability in\nscience. The print reader is subjected to a black and white flicker that is\nregular and even. Print presents arrested moments of mental posture. This\nalternating flicker is also the very mode of projection of subjective doubt\nand peripheral groping.\n\n### Applied knowledge in the Renaissance had to take the form of translation\nof the auditory into visual terms, of the plastic into retinal form.\n\nThe Renaissance discoveries of Father Ong, detailed in his _Ramus: Method, and\nthe Decay of Dialogue_ (from which we quote below) and numerous articles, are\nof direct relevance to the student of the effects of Gutenberg technology.\nOng’s investigation of the role of visualization in later medieval logic and\nphilosophy is our direct concern here, for visualization and quantification\nare near twins. Earlier we have seen how, for the humanists, medieval glosses,\nillumination, and architectural modes had all served the art of memory. Also,\nthe medieval dialecticians pursued their oral courses well into the sixteenth\ncentury:\n\nThe invention of printing invited large-scale manipulation of words in space\nand gave new urgency to the drive toward handling logic or dialectic\nquantitatively, a drive long manifest in the medieval arts scholostics. … The\ntendency for quantitative or quasi-quantitative manipulation of logic to\ndissipate itself in memory devices will be a noteworthy feature of Ramism. (p.\nxv)\n\nThe manuscript culture had not been able to duplicate visual knowledge on a\nmass scale and was less tempted to seek the means of reducing non-visual\nprocesses of mind to diagrams. Yet, even so, there is steady pressure in the\nlater scholasticism to strip language to a kind of neuter mathematical\ncounters. The “nominalists” were those who specialized in the logical\ntreatises of Peter of Spain. The opening words of his _Summulae_ have a ring,\nas Ong notes ([p. 60](ch02.html#page_60)), that would be familiar at any time\nfrom Cicero to Emerson: “Dialectic is the art of arts and the science of\nsciences, possessing the way to the principles of all curriculum subjects. For\ndialectic alone disputes with probability concerning the principles of all\nother arts, and thus dialectic must be the first science to be acquired.” The\nhumanists, especially after printing extended the boundaries of literature,\ncomplained bitterly that boys should have to comb through the divisions and\ndistinctions of Peter of Spain.\n\nThe point of all this is that the drive to deal spatially and geometrically\nwith words and logic, while useful as an art of memory, proved _cul de sac_ in\nphilosophy. It needed the mathematical symbolism we have devised today. But it\ndid contribute directly to the spirit of quantification that expressed itself\nin the mechanization of writing and what followed long before Gutenberg, “the\nadvance in quantification which medieval logic exhibits is one of the chief\ndifferences between it and the earlier Aristotelian logic.” ([p.\n72](ch02.html#page_72)) And quantification means the translation of non-visual\nrelations and realities into visual terms, a procedure inherent in the\nphonetic alphabet, as was shown earlier. But with Ramus in the sixteenth\ncentury it is not enough to make trees and schemes of knowledge:\n\nFor at the heart of the Ramist enterprise is the drive to tie down words\nthemselves, rather than other representations, in simple geometrical patterns.\nWords are believed to be recalcitrant insofar as they derive from a world of\nsound, voices, cries; the Ramist ambition is to neutralize this connection by\nprocessing what is of itself nonspatial in order to reduce it to space in the\nstarkest way possible. The spatial processing of sound by means of the\nalphabet is not enough. Printed or written words themselves must be deployed\nin spatial relationships, and the resulting schemata thought of as a key to\ntheir meanings. ([pp. 89](ch02.html#page_89)–90)\n\nConfronted with the numerous relationships between Ramus and “applied\nknowledge,” Father Ong has published an article, “Ramist Method and the\nCommercial Mind,”[50](ch02a_fn45.html#ch02a_fn45fn50) which makes an admirable\napproach to the obsession with quantification in the Renaissance:\n\nOne of the persistent puzzles concerning Peter Ramus and his followers is the\nextraordinary diffusion of their works during the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies. The general pathway of this diffusion has been well known since\nWaddington’s _Ramus_ in 1855. It proceeds chiefly through bourgeois Protestant\ngroups of merchants and artisans more or less tinged with Calvinism. These\ngroups are found not only in Ramus’ native France, but especially in Germany,\nSwitzerland, the Low Countries, England, Scotland, Scandinavia, and New\nEngland. Perry Miller’s work, _The New England Mind: the Seventeenth Century_\n, is the most detailed study of Ramism in any such group. Such groups were\nmoving into more openly influential positions socially and were improving\nthemselves intellectually, and Ramism appeals to them as they move up. Ramus’\nworks thus enjoyed particular favor not in highly sophisticated intellectual\ncircles but rather in elementary or secondary schools or along the fringe\nwhere secondary schooling and university education meet …\n\nWhat is necessary to understand here is that the key to any kind of _applied_\nknowledge is the translation of a complex of relations into explicit visual\nterms. The alphabet itself as applied to the complex of the spoken word\ntranslates speech into a visual code that can be uniformly spread and\ntransported. Print had given an intensity to this latent process that was a\nvirtual educational and economic take-off. Ramus, with the whole scholastic\ndrive behind him was able to translate it into the visual “humanism of the new\nmerchant classes.” Such is the simplicity and crudity of the spatial models\npromoted by Ramus that no cultivated mind, and nobody sensitive to language,\ncould be bothered with them. And yet it was this crudity that gave him his\nappeal to the self-educated and to the merchant classes. Just how large a\nsection of the new reading public these were has been demonstrated in the\ngreat study of _Middle-Class Culture in Elizabethan England_ by L. B. Wright.\n\n### Typography tended to alter language from a means of perception and\nexploration to a portable commodity.\n\nAs for the mere stress on use and practicality, it is not only Ramus but the\nentire humanist corps that insists upon that. From the Sophists to Cicero\ntraining in language and oratory had been accepted as the road to power and\ntop executive action. The Ciceronian program of encyclopedic knowledge in the\narts and sciences came back with printing. The essentially dialogue character\nof scholasticism gave way to a more extensive program in languages and\nliterature for the training of the Courtier and the Governor and the Prince.\nWhat we have come to consider as an impossibly genteel curriculum of authors,\nlanguages, and history was in the Renaissance held necessary for the\nstatesman, on one hand, and the study of Scripture, on the other. Shakespeare\npresents (I, i) his Henry the Fifth as combining both:\n\nHear him but reason in divinity,  \nAnd, all-admiring, with an inward wish  \nYou would desire the King were made a prelate;  \nHear him debate of commonwealth affairs,  \nYou would say it hath been all in all his study;  \nList his discourse of war, and you shall hear  \nA fearful battle rend’red you in music;  \nTurn him to any cause of policy,  \nThe Gordian knot of it he will unloose,  \nFamiliar as his garter: that, when he speaks,  \nThe air, a charter’d libertine, is still,  \nAnd the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears,  \nTo steal his sweet and honey’d sentences;  \nSo that the art and practic part of life  \nMust be the mistress to this theoric;  \nWhich is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,  \nSince his addiction was to courses vain,  \nHis companies unletter’d, rude and shallow,  \nHis hours fill’d up with riots, banquets, sports;  \nAnd never noted in him any study,  \nAny retirement, any sequestration  \nFrom open haunts and popularity.\n\nBut the practical qualities fostered by Ramism are more immediately related to\nnumbers than to letters: “While Adam Smith attacked the system which emerged,\nhe was aware of its advantages in defence. He saw it as part of the spread of\nthe price system which had swept aside the feudal system, and led to the\ndiscovery of the New World …”[51](ch02a_fn46.html#ch02a_fn46fn51) Innis is\nhere writing on “The Penetrative Powers of the Price System,” by which he\nmeans the power to translate one set of functions into a new mode and\nlanguage. The feudal system was based on oral culture and self-contained\nsystem of centres-without-margins, as Pirenne showed us earlier. This\nstructure was translated by visual, quantitative means into great centre-\nmargin systems of a nationalist mercantile kind, a process greatly assisted by\nprinting. It is interesting to see the way in which Adam Smith viewed this\nprocess of drastic translation carried out in the English Civil War. It was\njust about to take place in France:\n\nA revolution of the greatest importance to public happiness was in this manner\nbrought about by two different orders of people, who had not the least\nintention to serve the public. To gratify the most childish vanity was the\nsole motive of the great proprietors. The merchants and artificers, much less\nridiculous, acted merely from a view to their own interest, and in pursuit of\ntheir own pedlar principles of turning a penny wherever a penny was to be got.\nNeither of them had either knowledge or foresight of that great revolution\nwhich the folly of the one, and the industry of the other, was gradually\nbringing about. It is thus that through the greater part of Europe the\ncommerce and manufacture of cities, instead of being the effect, have been the\ncause and occasion of the improvement and cultivation of the\ncountry.[52](ch02a_fn46.html#ch02a_fn46fn52)\n\nThe French Revolution, long prepared by the homogenizing print process, as de\nTocqueville will show us, followed the pattern of Ramist reasonings which as\nOng stresses “while seldom advertised as serving the purposes of debate, they\nfrequently manifest an express concern for simplification”:\n\nHooykaas makes less of Ramus’ talk about “induction” than of his enthusiasm\nfor _usus_ , that is, classroom practice or exercise, in establishing the\nrelationship of Ramus’ educational aims and procedures to bourgeois culture.\nThe break with older ways both among burghers generally and among Ramists in\nparticular consisted more in an interest in pupil activity than in anything we\nshould recognize today as experimentation or “induction.” These points Hooykas\nmakes are valid and follow recent lines of thinking in discerning a certain\nintellectual fertility in the meeting of the artisan and academic minds during\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.[53](ch02a_fn47.html#ch02a_fn47fn53)\n\nOng here points to a basic fact about print culture. Printed books, themselves\nthe first uniform, repeatable, and mass-produced items in the world, provided\nendless paradigms of uniform commodity culture for sixteenth and succeeding\ncenturies. Shakespeare makes frequent play with this fact as in _King John_\n(II, i):\n\nThat smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,  \nCommodity, the bias of the world –  \nThe world, who of itself is peised well,  \nMade to run even upon even ground  \nTill this advantage, this vile drawing bias,  \nThis sway of motion, this Commodity,  \nMakes it take head from all indifferency,  \nFrom all direction, purpose, course, intent –  \nAnd this same bias, this Commodity,  \nThis bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,  \nClapp’d on the outward eye of fickle France,  \nHath drawn him from his own determin’d aid,  \nFrom a resolved and honourable war,  \nTo a most base and vile-concluded peace.  \nAnd why rail I on this Commodity?  \nBut for because he hath not woo’d me yet.  \nNot that I have the power to clutch my hand  \nWhen his fair angels would salute my palm;  \nBut for my hand, as unattempted yet,  \nLike a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.  \nWell, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail  \nAnd say there is no sin but to be rich;  \nAnd being rich, my virtue then shall be  \nTo say there is no vice but beggary.  \nSince kings break faith upon commodity,  \nGain, be my lord, for I will worship thee!\n\n### Typography is not only a technology but is in itself a natural resource or\nstaple,\n\nlike cotton or timber or radio; and, like any staple, it shapes not only\nprivate sense ratios but also patterns of communal interdependence.\n\nPrint, as it were, translated the dialogue of shared discourse into packaged\ninformation, a portable commodity. It put a spin or bias in language and human\nperception which Shakespeare studies here as “Commodity.” How could it do\notherwise? It created the price system. For until commodities are uniform and\nrepeatable the price of an article is subject to haggle and adjustment. The\nuniformity and repeatability of the book not only created modern markets and\nthe price system inseparable from literacy and industry. Lewis Mumford writes\nin _Sticks and Stones_ ([pp. 41](ch02.html#page_41)–2):\n\nVictor Hugo said in Notre Dame that the printing-press destroyed architecture,\nwhich had hitherto been the stone record of mankind. The real misdemeanor of\nthe printing-press, however, was not that it took literary values away from\narchitecture, but that it caused architecture to derive its value from\nliterature. With the Renaissance the great modern distinction between the\nliterate and the illiterate extends even to building; the master mason who\nknew his stone and his workmen and his tools and the tradition of his art gave\nway to the architect who knew his Palladio and his Vignola and his Vitruvius.\nArchitecture, instead of striving to leave the imprint of a happy spirit on\nthe superficies of a building, became a mere matter of grammatical accuracy\nand pronunciation; and the seventeenth century architects who revolted from\nthis regime and created the baroque were at home only in the pleasure gardens\nand theaters of princes …\n\nIn his youth a student of the Scottish biologist Patrick Geddes, Mumford has\nalways given us a civilized example of how unnecessary and unrewarding are the\nways of the specialist who sees nothing in relation to anything else: “It was\nby means of the book that the architecture of the eighteenth century from St.\nPetersburg to Philadelphia seemed cast by a single mind.” ([p.\n43](ch02.html#page_43))\n\nPrint was in itself a commodity, a new natural resource which also showed us\nhow to tap all other kinds of resources including ourselves. Media as staples\nor natural resources are the theme of the later work of Harold Innis. His\nearly work concerns staples in the ordinary sense. In his maturity he hit on\nthe discovery that technological media like writing, papyrus, radio,\nphotoengraving, and such are themselves\nwealth.[54](ch02a_fn48.html#ch02a_fn48fn54)\n\nWithout a technology tending to process experience homogeneously, a society\ncannot go far toward the control of natural forces nor even the organization\nof human effort. This was the ironic theme of _The Bridge Over the River\nKwai._ The Japanese Buddhist Colonel has no technology to tackle the job. The\nEnglish Colonel has it all diagrammed and segmented in no time. Of course, he\nhas no proper end in view. His technology is his way of life. He lives by the\nbook of the Geneva Convention. To an oral Frenchman all this is hilarious.\nEnglish and American audiences found the picture profound, subtle, elusive.\n\nIn his _Two-Edged Sword_ , John L. McKenzie shows ([p. 13](ch02.html#page_13))\nhow Biblical studies in the twentieth century have abandoned the concept of\nthe lineal, homogeneous structure of Scriptural narration:\n\nModern control and use of natural forces was not known to the Hebrews, nor did\nthe wildest fancy dream of anything like it. … The ancient Hebrews were\nprephilosophical; the most ordinary patterns of modern thought were unknown to\nthem. Logic as a form of mental discipline they lacked. Their language is the\nspeech of the simple man who sees motion and action rather than static\nreality, static reality as concrete rather than abstract.\n\nIn our legal world words are carefully reduced to homogeneous entities so that\nthey can be applied. If allowed any grace or life such as is naturally theirs,\nthey would not serve their practical, applied function.\n\nI have shown that the theory I offer you is based on a natural virtue in words\nthemselves. Let me state this theory of interpretation dogmatically before I\nturn the coin over to show that it conforms with the actual practices of\ndraftsmanship.\n\nWords in legal documents – I am not talking about anything else – are simply\ndelegations to others of authority to apply them to particular things or\noccasions. The only meaning of the word meaning, as I am using it, is an\napplication to the particular. And the more imprecise the words are, the\ngreater is the delegation, simply because then they can be applied or not to\nmore particulars. This is the only important feature of words in legal\ndraftsmanship or interpretation.\n\nThey mean, therefore, not what their author intended them to mean, or even\nwhat meaning he intended, or expected, reasonably or not, others to give them.\nThey mean, in the first instance, what the person to whom they are addressed\nmakes them mean. Their meaning is whatever occasion or thing he may apply them\nto or what in some cases he may only propose to apply them to. The meaning of\nwords in legal documents is to be sought, not in their author or authors, the\nparties to a contract, the testator, or the legislature, but in the acts or\nthe behavior with which the person addressed undertakes to match them. This is\nthe beginning of their meaning.\n\nIn the second instance, but only secondarily, a legal document is also\naddressed to the courts. This is a further delegation, and a delegation of a\ndifferent authority, to decide, not what the word means, but whether the\nimmediate addressee had authority to make them mean what he did make them\nmean, or what he proposes to make them mean. In other words, the question\nbefore the court is not whether he gave the words the right meaning, but\nwhether or not the words authorized the meaning he gave\nthem.[55](ch02a_fn49.html#ch02a_fn49fn55)\n\nWhat Curtis so correctly discerns in the nature of applied terminology,\nequally concerns populations, civil and military. Unless processed in a\nuniform way, it would be quite impossible to have delegation of functions and\nduties, and thus there could be no centralized national groupings such as came\ninto existence after printing. Without similar uniform processing by literacy,\nthere could be no market or price system, a factor which constrains “backward”\ncountries to be “communist,” or tribal. There is no known means of having our\nprice and distribution system without long and extensive experience of\nliteracy. But we are swiftly becoming aware of these matters as we move into\nthe electronic era. For telegraph, radio and TV do not tend towards the\nhomogeneous in their effects of print culture and dispose us to easier\nawareness on non-print cultures.\n\n### The passion for exact measurement began to dominate the Renaissance.\n\nJust as Father Ong in his work on Ramus has provided the necessary insight\ninto the strange similarities of form and motive between medieval logicians\nand Renaissance merchants, so John U. Nef has given us the connection between\nRenaissance science and commerce. His _Cultural Foundations of Industrial\nCivilization_ is a study of quantification, especially as it intruded into the\ncommercial world.\n\nThe spirit of rigorous separation and translation of functions by stress on\nvisual quantity had beset the later scholastic centuries and contributed to\nthe mechanization of the scribal craft, as we have seen. The pursuit of\ndichotomies and divisions carried over from scholasticism to mathematics and\nscience, as Nef indicates ([pp. 4](ch01.html#page_4)–5):\n\nThe very separation of science from faith, from ethics and from art, which is\nso characteristic of our times, is at the roots of the industrialized world in\nwhich we live. In a letter destined for Fermat, which he sent to Father\nMersenne in 1637, Descartes remarked that the great Toulouse mathematician\nseemed to suppose “that in saying a thing is easy to believe, I meant only to\nsay that it is probable. This is far from my position: I consider everything\nthat is only probable as almost false…” Such a position has led to the\nadmission as true of only what is verifiable in tangible and increasingly in\nmeasurable terms, or in terms of mathematical demonstrations which start from\npropositions artificially divorced from the actual experience of living. Since\nit is impossible, as Pascal seems to have been the first to recognize, to\noffer the same kind of tangible proof and to get the same kind of assent in\nmatters of faith, of morals and of beauty, the truths of religion, moral\nphilosophy and art have come to be treated as subjects of private opinion\nrather than of public knowledge. Their contributions to the contemporary world\nare _indirect_ , though not for that reason necessarily inferior to those of\nscience.\n\nArtificial separation of mental modes in the interests of homogeneity conveyed\na sentiment of certitude to Descartes and his time. A century of more and more\nrapid movement of information by print had developed new sensibilities. In\nNef’s words ([p. 8](ch01.html#page_8)):\n\nDuring the hundred years that followed Rabelais’ death in 1553, there are many\nindications that exact time, exact quantities, exact distances were coming to\nhave a greatly increased interest for men and women in connexion with private\nand public life. One of the most impressive examples of the new concern with\nprecision was the action taken by the Church of Rome to provide a more exact\ncalendar. Throughout the Middle Ages the ways in which the Christian peoples\nmeasured the passage of time were based on calculations made before the fall\nof the Roman Empire. The Julian calendar of A.D. 325 was still in use in the\nage of Rabelais.\n\nThe rise of statistics permitted the isolation of economics from the general\nsocial fabric of the sixteenth century:\n\nThe Europeans were striving after a higher degree of quantitative accuracy in\nmany domains during the span of the eighty years or so that followed. Some of\nthem attached a novel importance to the amassing of statistics, and notable of\nstatistics concerning rates of increase, as guides to economic policy, at the\nvery period when, with Bodin, Malynes, Laffemas, Montchretien and Mun,\neconomics first emerged as a separate subject of human speculative inquiry,\nindependent both of housekeeping, the concern of each of us in his daily\nactive life, and of moral philosophy, the concern of us all for the guidance\nof our inner lives. ([p. 10](ch01.html#page_10))\n\nAlready Europe was moving so far in the direction of visualized measurement\nand quantification of life that it “came to occupy for the first time a place\napart from both the Near and Far East.” In other words, under manuscript\nconditions Europe was not very sharply distinct from the East which was also a\nmanuscript culture.\n\nLet us turn a moment from Nef to Ong for confirmation of the new passion for\nquantity and measurement, we find that “the Ramist method appealed primarily\nto a desire for order, not to a desire for experimentation.… Ramus takes what\nmight be called an itemizing approach to\ndiscourse.”[56](ch02a_fn50.html#ch02a_fn50fn56)\n\nThat the new commercial classes took to the itemizing approach can be\ndocumented from many quarters. Its novelty and oddity provided hilarity on the\nElizabethan stage. Ben Jonson’s Sir Politick Would-Be in _Volpone_ is a would-\nbe Machiavel, and Jonson naturally links the new statecraft with the new\ntechniques of visual observation and organization of action:\n\nI do love\n\nTo note and to observe: though I live out,  \nFree from the active torrent, yet I’d mark  \nThe currents and the passages of things,  \nFor mine own private use; and know the ebbs  \nAnd flows of state.\n\nSir Politick in Venice inquires of Peregrine:\n\nWhy came you forth\n\nEmpty of rules for travel?\n\n_Peregrine:_ Faith, I had\n\nSome common ones from out of that vulgar grammar\n\nWhich he that cried Italian to me, taught me. (II, i)\n\nLater in Act IV, Sir Politick is doing some itemizing for Peregrine:\n\n_Sir P._ Nay, sir, conceive me. It will cost me in onions,\n\nsome thirty livres –\n\n_Per._ Which is one pound sterling.\n\n_Sir P._ Beside my water-works: for this I do, sir\n\nFirst, I bring in your ship ‘twixt two brick walls;\n\nBut those the state shall venture: On the one\n\nI strain me a fair tarpauling, and in that\n\nI stick my onions, cut in halves: the other\n\nIs full of loop-holes, out at which I thrust\n\nThe noses of my bellows; and those bellows\n\nI keep, with water-works, in perpetual motion,\n\nWhich is the easiest matter of a hundred.\n\nNow, sir, your onion, which doth naturally\n\nAttract the infection, and your bellows blowing\n\nThe air upon him, will show, instantly,\n\nBy his changed colour, if there be contagion;\n\nOr else remain as fair as at the first.\n\n– Now it is known, ’tis nothing.\n\n_Per._ You are right, sir.\n\n_Sir P._ I would I had my note.\n\n_Per._ ‘Faith, so would I’:\n\nBut you have done well for once, sir.\n\n_Sir P._ Were I false,\n\nOr would be made so, I could shew you reasons\n\nHow I could sell this state now to the Turk,\n\nSpite of their gallies, or _their_ – _[Examining his papers]_\n\n_Per._ Pray you, sir Pol.\n\n_Sir P._ I have them not about me.\n\n_Per._ That I fear’d:\n\nThey are there, sir.\n\n_Sir P._ No, this is my diary,\n\nWherein I note my actions of the day.\n\n_Per._ Pray you, let’s see, sir. What is here? _Notandum_ , [Reads]\n\n_A rat had gnawn my spur-leathers; notwithstanding_,\n\n_I put on new, and did go forth: but first_\n\n_I threw three beans over the threshold. Item_ ,\n\n_I went and bought two tooth-picks, whereof one_\n\n_I burst immediately, in a discourse_\n\n_With a Dutch merchant, ’bout ragion del stato._\n\n_From him I went and paid a moccinigo_\n\n_For piecing my silk stockings; by the way_\n\n_I cheapen’d sprats; and at St. Mark’s I urined._\n\n_’Faith these are politic notes!_\n\n_Sir P._ Sir, I do slip\n\nNo action of my life, but thus I quote it.\n\n_Per._ Believe me, it is wise!\n\n_Sir P._ Nay, sir, read forth.\n\nThere can be, then, no mystery about why Sam Pepys kept just this kind of\ndiary half a century later. It was a discipline of observation and precision\nfor the would-be Machiavellian merchant. To the Elizabethan audience Iago’s\napologia in the first scene of Othello would have labelled him an obvious goon\nof the Politick Would-be stamp:\n\nO, sir, content you.  \nI follow him to serve my turn upon him.  \nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters  \nCannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark  \nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave  \nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,  \nWears out his time, much like his master’s ass,  \nFor naught but provender; and when he’s old, cashier’d.  \nWhip me such honest knaves! Others there are,  \nWho, trimm’d in forms and visages of duty,  \nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves;  \nAnd, throwing but shows of service on their lords,  \nDo well thrive by them, and, when they have lin’d their coats,  \nDo themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;  \nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,  \nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,  \nWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago.  \nIn following him, I follow but myself;  \nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,  \nBut seeming so, for my peculiar end;  \nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate  \nThe native act and figure of my heart  \nIn compliment extern, ’tis not long after  \nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve  \nFor daws to peck at. I am not what I am.\n\n### The printmade split between head\n\nand heart is the trauma which affects Europe from Machiavelli till the\npresent.\n\nWhat seemed fantastic in the early phases of print and the isolation of\nvisuality, was that it appeared to create a comic hypocrisy or split between\nhead and heart. It is interesting to see how the same split appeared to an\nIrishman and an Englishman just two hundred years later, at the end of the\neighteenth century. Here is Edmund Burke, the sentimental Gael, commenting on\nthe itemizing, calculating spirit in his _Reflections on the Revolution in\nFrance:_\n\nIt is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the queen of France, then the\ndauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this orb, which she\nhardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her just above the\nhorizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move\nin, – glittering like the morning-star, full of life, and splendour, and joy.\nOh! what a revolution! and what a heart must I have to contemplate, without\nemotion that elevation and that fall! Little did I dream when she added titles\nof veneration to those of enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she\nshould ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed\nin that bosom; little did I dream that I should have lived to see such\ndisasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of\nhonour, and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from\ntheir scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult. But the\nage of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators, has\nsucceeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished for ever. Never, never more\nshall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission,\nthat dignified obedience, that subordination of the heart, which kept alive,\neven in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace\nof life, the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic\nenterprise, is gone! It is gone, that sensibility of principle, that charity\nof honour, which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it\nmitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice\nitself lost half its evil, by losing all its grossness.\n\nAnd here is William Cobbett, the cool Saxon, in his _A Years’ Residence in\nAmerica_ (1795) recording his amazement at the new kind of man made there by\nprint culture:\n\n356\\. There are very few really _ignorant_ men in America of native growth.\nEvery farmer is more or less of a _reader_. There is no _brogue_ , no\n_provincial dialect_. No class like that which the French call _peasantry_ ,\nand which degrading appellation the miscreant spawn of the Funds have, of late\nyears, applied to the whole mass of the most useful of the people in England,\nthose who do the work and fight the battles. And, as to the men, who would\nnaturally form _your_ acquaintances, they, I know from experience, are as\nkind, frank, and sensible men as are, on the general run, to be found in\nEngland, even with the power of selection. They are all well-informed; modest\nwithout shyness; always free to communicate what they know, and never ashamed\nto acknowledge that they have yet to learn. You never hear them _boast_ of\ntheir possessions, and you never hear them _complaining_ of their wants. They\nhave all been _readers_ from their youth up; and there are few subjects upon\nwhich they cannot converse with you, whether of a political or scientific\nnature. At any rate, they always _hear_ with patience. I do not know what I\never heard a native American interrupt another man while he was speaking.\nTheir _sedateness_ and _coolness_ , the _deliberate_ manner in which they say\nand do every thing, and the _slowness_ and _reserve_ with which they express\ntheir assent; these are very wrongly estimated, when they are taken for marks\nof a _want of feeling_. It must be a tale of woe indeed, that will bring a\ntear from an American’s eye; but any trumped up story will send his hand to\nhis pocket, as the ambassadors from the beggars of France, Italy and Germany\ncan fully testify.\n\n357\\. However, you will not, for a long while, know what to do for want of the\n_quick responses_ of the English tongue, and the _decided_ tone of the English\nexpression. The _loud voice_ : the _hard squeeze_ by the hand; the _instant\nassent_ or _dissent_ : the _clamorous joy_ : the _bitter wailing_: the _ardent\nfriendship_ : the _deadly enmity_ : the _love that makes people kill\nthemselves_ : the _hatred that makes them kill others_. All these belong to\nthe characters of Englishmen, in whose minds and hearts every feeling exists\nin the _extreme_. To decide the question, which character is, upon the whole,\n_best_ , the American or the English, we must appeal to some _third party_ …\n\nThat most Englishmen still retained the oral, passionate wholeness of\ncharacter seemed as obvious to Cobbett as to Dickens. And Cobbett does not\nhesitate to observe that book culture had created the new man in America. The\nnew man has literally taken to _heart_ the message of print, and put on “the\nnapless vesture of humility.” He has stripped himself like Lear till he\nfulfils the ideal of Thomas Huxley, who wrote in 1868 in his essay on “A\nLiberal Education”:\n\n“That man, I think, has had a liberal education who has been so trained in his\nyouth that his body is the ready servant of his will, and does with ease and\npleasure all the work, that as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose intellect\nis a clear, cold, logic engine, with all the parts of equal strength, and in\nsmooth working order; ready like a steam engine to be turned to any kind of\nwork. …”[57](ch02a_fn51.html#ch02a_fn51fn57)\n\nClose on the sentimental heels of this scientific vision came the figure of\nSherlock Holmes of whom Doyle said in _A Scandal in Bohemia_ :\n\nHe was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the\nworld has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false\nposition. He never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer.\n… Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power\nlenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as\nhis.[58](ch02a_fn51.html#ch02a_fn51fn58)\n\nIt will become even plainer in the present volume why the Gutenberg drive to\napply knowledge by translation and uniformity encounters such resistance in\nthe matters of sex and race.\n\nThe process of “uniformatization” in its social and political bearings is\nexplained by de Tocqueville very clearly in _L’Ancien Régime_ ([pp.\n83](ch02.html#page_83)–4, 103, 125):\n\nI have already pointed out how almost throughout the whole kingdom the special\nlife of the different provinces had long since perished; that had helped very\nmuch to make all Frenchmen very like each other. Despite the diversities which\nstill existed, the unity of the nation was already clear; it is disclosed by\nthe uniformity of the legislation. The farther down the eighteenth century we\ncome there is a corresponding increase in the number of royal edicts, royal\ndeclarations, decrees of Council, which apply the same rules in the same\nmanner to all parts of the governed, who conceived the idea of a legislation\nquite general and quite uniform, the same everywhere, the same for all; this\nidea is revealed in all the successive projects of reform that appeared during\nthe thirty years which preceded the outbreak of the Revolution. Two centuries\nbefore, the very material for such a conception would, so to speak, have been\nwanting.\n\nNot only did the provinces resemble each other more and more, but in each\nprovince the men of different classes, at least all those who ranked above the\ncommon people, became more and more alike, despite the differences of rank.\n\nNothing shows this more clearly than the reading of the ‘instructions’\npresented by the different orders in 1789. Those who drew them up differed\nprofoundly in their interests, but in everything else they showed themselves\nalike.\n\nWhat is still more strange is that all these men, who kept themselves so apart\nfrom each other, had become so much alike that it would have been impossible\nto distinguish them if their places had been changed. Nay more, if a man had\nbeen able to sound their innermost spirit, he would have discovered that these\ntiny barriers, which divided people so much alike, appeared to the men\nthemselves as contrary alike to the public interest and to good sense and that\nin theory they already adored unity. Each of them stuck to his own particular\ncondition simply because every one else was particularized by his condition\nbut they were all ready to be confounded in one mass, provided that no one had\nany separate position nor rose superior to the common level.\n\nInseparable from the homogenizing of men and manners in the literacy process\nwas the equally pervasive concern with consumer goods:\n\nThe men of the eighteenth century hardly knew that kind of passion for\nmaterial comfort, which is, so to speak, the mother of servitude, an\nenervating but tenacious and unalterable passion, which readily mingles with\nand twines itself round many private virtues such as love of family,\nrespectability of life, regard for religious beliefs, and even the assiduous\nif lukewarm practice of the established worship, which is partial to\nrespectability but forbids heroism, which excels in making men steady but\ncitizens mean-spirited. The men of the eighteenth century were both better and\nworse.\n\nThe French of that date loved joy and adored pleasure; they were perhaps more\nirregular in their habits and more unbridled in their passions and in their\nideas than men of to-day; but they knew nothing of that judicious and well-\nregulated sensualism that _we_ see around us. The upper classes were more\nconcerned to adorn life than to make it comfortable, to make themselves\nillustrious rather than rich.\n\nEven in the middle classes a man was not entirely devoted to the pursuit of\ncomfort; the pursuit was often abandoned for the desire of higher and more\nrefined pleasures; some other good rather than money was everywhere the\nobjective. “I know my countrymen,” wrote a contemporary, in a style fantastic\nbut not wanting in pride, “clever at melting and dissipating the metals, but\nnot ready to give them continuous worship; they will be quite ready to return\nto their ancient idols – valor, glory, and, I make bold to say, magnanimity.”\n\n### The Machiavellian mind and the merchant mind are\n\nat one in their simple faith in the power of segmental division to rule all –\nin the dichotomy of power and morals and of money and morals.\n\nAs de Chardin explains in his _Phenomenon of Man_ , new invention is the\ninteriorization in man of the structures of earlier technology; and therefore\nit stockpiles, as it were. What we are studying here is the interiorization of\nprint technology and its effect in shaping a new kind of man. De Chardin\nspeaks of our own day when there are so many new technologies to interiorize:\n“Firstly, the power of invention, so rapidly intensified at the present time\nby the rationalised recoil of all the forces of research that it is already\npossible to speak of a forward leap of evolution.” ([p.\n305](ch03.html#page_305))\n\nApplied knowledge has no mysteries then. It consists in segmentation of any\nprocess or any situation or any human being. The Machiavellian power technique\nis exactly the one ridiculed by Ben Jonson and Shakespeare in the passages\nabove. One observes a human being to see “what makes him tick.” That is, you\nreduce him to a machine. Then you isolate his ruling passion, the fuel of the\nmachine. Then you have him. Wyndham Lewis has given a fine account of these\nMachiavellian techniques as they appear in Elizabethan drama in _The Lion and\nthe Fox_ , from which we had seen earlier his description of the Hollywood\naspect of Italian princely architecture.\n\nIt is not only people that are reduced to things by the segmental itemizing\nmethods of the new print culture. Father Ong points out in “Ramist Method and\nthe Commercial Mind” ([p. 167](ch02a.html#page_167)):\n\nThe mass-production methods utilized for bookmaking made it possible and\nindeed necessary to think of books less as representations of words serving\nfor the communication of thought and more as things. Books came to be regarded\nmore and more as products of crafts and as commodities to be merchandised. The\nword, living human speech, is here in a sense reified. Even before the advent\nof typography a marked reification of the word had been begun by the medieval\nterminist logicians, and elsewhere I have discussed in detail the\npsychological connections between terminist logic, the topical logic which\nsucceeded it in the humanist age, and the development of attitudes toward\ncommunication favoring typography. The terminist logic was indeed still\nrepresented at Paris in Ramus’ youth or not long before by persons such as\nJuan de Celaya, John Dullaert, and John Major, and even later by Ramus’ own\ndefender Jean Quentin. But the terminist tradition had favored the reification\nof the word for intellectual purposes. This impulse to reification had come\nfrom the academy. When we view typographical developments from the burghers’\nstandpoint, we see another type of drive to reification joining forces with\nthe first. If the logicians wanted to hypostatize expression so as to subject\nit to formal analysis, the merchants were willing to hypostatize expression in\norder to sell it. …\n\nIt is not surprising that the Ramist visual methods of itemizing and\nclassifying should sound, as Ong says ([p. 167](ch02a.html#page_167)–8)\n“highly reminiscent of printing processes themselves, so that it enables one\nto impose organization on a subject by imagining it as made up of parts fixed\nin space much in the way in which words are locked into a printer’s form.”\n\nThis overwhelming example of print as visual, sequential, uniform, and lineal\nwas not lost on human sensibility in the sixteenth century. But before turning\nto its more dramatic manifestations it is necessary to indicate, as Ong has\ndone, that the obsession with “method” in the Renaissance finds its archetype\nin “the process of setting up type taken from a font. In each instance, the\ncomposition of continuous discourse is a matter of building up discourse by\narranging preëxisting parts in a spatial pattern.” ([p.\n168](ch02a.html#page_168)) And it is obvious that Ramus exercised his\nextraordinary appeal by being close to the new patterns of sensibility that\npeople experienced in their contact with typography. The new “typographic man”\nwho shot into prominence with printing will get full attention a little later\non in connection with individualism and nationalism. Here we are concerned to\nfind out the ways in which print structured ideas of _applied_ knowledge by\nseparation and division, moving always towards sharper visualization. In Ong’s\nwords ([p. 168](ch02a.html#page_168)): “This increased sophistication in\nvisual presentation is not restricted, of course, to Ramist writings, but is\npart of the evolution of typography, showing clearly how the use of printing\nmoved the word away from its original association with sound and treated it\nmore and more as a ‘thing’ in space.”\n\nOng makes the extremely important point ([p. 169](ch02a.html#page_169)) that\nthe Ramist hostility to Aristotle was based on his incompatibility with print\nculture:\n\nIn manuscripts, diagrams are much more laborious productions than straight\ntext, for manuscript copying only with great difficulty controls the position\nof material on the page. Typographical reproduction controls it automatically\nand inevitably. … If Ramus did indeed defend his reputed anti-Aristotelian\nthesis, _Quaecumque ab Aristotele dicta essent commentitia esse_ , … he quite\nevidently meant this to say not that Aristotle was untruthful (a common\ninterpretation of the reported thesis) but rather that Aristotle’s material\nwas poorly organized, not properly controlled by ‘method’.\n\nIn other words, it was unsuited for the Gutenberg era.\n\nThe accommodation of studies by Ramist diagrams and divisions was the first\nlarge move of learning in the direction of the merchant mind. So we shall\nleave Father Ong after quoting a last passage from [page\n170](ch02a.html#page_170) which will help bring us back to Professor Nef:\n\nBut there was another aspect of Ramist method which gave it appeal to the\nbourgeois groups among whom it was a favorite. It was very much like account\nkeeping. The merchant not only deals in wares, but he has a way of keeping\nrecord of them which levels all sorts of items to the pages of an account\nbook. Here the most diverse products are mingled on an equal footing – wool,\nwax, incense, coal, iron, and jewels – although they have nothing in common\nexcept commercial value. To handle a merchant’s wares in terms of his account\nbooks, one need not trouble oneself with the nature of the wares. One has to\nknow only the principles of accounting.\n\n### Dantzig explains why the language of number had to be\n\nincreased to meet the needs created by the new technology of letters.\n\nThe unremitting pressure on society to discover accurate means of\nquantification is in ratio to the individualist pressures in the society.\nPrint intensified the tendency to individualism as all historians have\ntestified. It also provided the means of quantification in its very\ntechnology. The monumental work of William I, Thomas and Florian Znaniecki,\n_The Polish Peasant in Europe and America_ , is indispensable to any serious\nanalyst of the effects of print culture on peasant culture. They write (vol.\nI, [p. 182](ch02a.html#page_182)):\n\nBut of course when once the egotistic attitude is introduced into economic\nrelations, these relations have to be objectively regulated. And thus\nultimately the principle of economic equivalence of services is introduced and\nbecomes fundamental, while there still remains always some place beside it for\nthe old valuation based upon the efficiency of the help and for the transitory\nvaluation based upon the subjective sacrifice.\n\nThe exceeding usefulness of _The Polish Peasant_ for understanding the\nGutenberg galaxy is that it offers a mosaic study of events in our time that\ncorrespond to what happened in the first Gutenberg age. What happened to the\nPolish peasant confronted with print technology and industrial organization,\nhas happened in lesser degree to the Russian and the Japanese, and is\nbeginning to happen in China.\n\nBefore concluding Professor Nef’s testimony on the development of\nquantification and applied knowledge in the first phase of Western\nindustrialism, it will be well to notice the role of number and mathematics\nconcurrent with the rise of movable types. Tobias Dantzig, in his _Number: The\nLanguage of Science_ , has provided a cultural history of mathematics which\nled Einstein to declare: “This is beyond doubt the most interesting book on\nthe evolution of mathematics that has ever fallen into my hands.” The\nexplanation of the rise of Euclidean sensibility from the phonetic alphabet\nwas given in the early part of this book. Phonetic letters, the language and\nmythic form of Western culture, have the power of translating or reducing all\nof our senses into visual and “pictorial” or “enclosed” space.\n\nMore than anybody else, the mathematician is aware of the arbitrary and\nfictional character of this continuous, homogeneous visual space. Why? Because\nnumber, the language of science, is a fiction for retranslating the Euclidean\nspace fiction back into auditory and tactile space.\n\nThe example Dantzig uses on [page 139](ch02a.html#page_139) concerns the\nmeasurement of the length of an arc:\n\nOur notion of the length of an arc of a curve may serve as an illustration.\nThe physical concept rests on that of a bent wire. We imagine that we have\n_straightened_ the wire without _stretching_ it; then the segment of the\nstraight line will serve as the measure of the length of the arc. Now what do\nwe mean by “without stretching”? We mean without a change in length. But this\nterm implies that we already know something about the length of the arc. Such\na formulation is obviously a _petitio principii_ and could not serve as a\nmathematical definition.\n\nThe alternative is to inscribe in the arc a sequence of rectilinear contours\nof an increasing number of sides. The sequence of these contours approaches a\nlimit, and the length of the arc is defined as the limit of this sequence.\n\nAnd what is true of the notion of length is true of areas, volumes, masses,\nmovements, pressures, forces, stresses and strains, velocities, accelerations,\netc., etc. All these notions were born in a “linear,” “rational” world where\nnothing takes place but what is straight, flat, and uniform. Either, then, we\nmust abandon these elementary rational notions – and this would mean a\nveritable revolution, so deeply are these concepts rooted in our minds; or we\nmust adapt those rational notions to a world which is neither flat, nor\nstraight, nor uniform.\n\nNow Dantzig is quite wrong in supposing that Euclidean space, linear, flat,\nstraight, uniform, is rooted in our minds at all. Such space is a product of\nliteracy and is unknown to pre-literate or archaic man. We have seen earlier\nthat Mircea Eliade has recently devoted a volume to this theme (_The Sacred\nand the Profane_), showing how the Western notions of space and time as\ncontinuous and homogeneous are quite absent from the lives of archaic man.\nThey are equally absent from Chinese culture. Pre-literate man conceives\nalways of uniquely structured spaces and times in the manner of mathematical\nphysics.\n\nThe invaluable demonstration of Dantzig is that in order to protect our vested\ninterest in Euclidean space (i.e., literacy) Western man devised the parallel\nbut antithetic mode of number in order to cope with all of the non-Euclidean\ndimensions of daily experience. He continues ([p. 140](ch02a.html#page_140)):\n\nBut how can the flat and the straight and the uniform be adapted to its very\nopposite, the skew and the curved and the non-uniform? Not by a finite number\nof steps, certainly! The miracle can be accomplished only by that miracle-\nmaker the _infinite_. Having determined to cling to the elementary rational\nnotions, we have no other alternative than to regard the “curved” reality of\nour senses as the ultra-ultimate step in an infinite sequence of _flat_ worlds\nwhich exist only in our imagination.\n\nThe miracle is that it works!\n\n### How the Greeks encountered the confusion of tongues when numbers invaded\nEuclidean space.\n\nAgain let us ask why should the phonetic alphabet have created the fiction of\nflat, straight and uniform space? The phonetic alphabet, unlike the complex\npictographics evolved by priestly groups of scribes for temple administration,\nwas a streamlined code for commerce. It was easy for anybody to learn and to\nuse and it was adaptable to any language whatever.\n\nNumber, that is to say, is itself an audile-tactile code which is meaningless\nwithout a highly developed phonetic-literate culture to complement it.\nTogether, letters and number constitute a powerful systole-diastole engine for\ntranslating and retranslating the modes of human awareness in a system of\n“double translation” such as appealed deeply to the early humanists of the\nRenaissance. Yet today number is as obsolete as the phonetic alphabet as a\nmeans of endowing and applying experience and knowledge. We are now as post-\nnumber as we are post-literate in the electronic age. There is a mode of\ncalculation that is pre-digital Dantzig points out ([p.\n14](ch02.html#page_14)):\n\nThere exists among the most primitive tribes of Australia and Africa a system\nof numeration which has neither 5, 10, nor 20 for base. It is a _binary_\nsystem, i.e., of base two. These savages have not yet reached finger counting.\nThey have independent numbers for one and two, and composite numbers up to\nsix. Beyond six everything is denoted by “heap.”\n\nDantzig indicates that even digital counting is a kind of abstraction or\nseparation of the tactile from the other senses, whereas the yes-no which\nprecedes it is a more “whole” response. Such, at any rate, are the new binary\ncomputers that dispense with number, and make possible the structuralist\nphysics of Heisenberg. For the ancient world, numbers had not been just\ntactile for measurement as they became in the split visual world of the\nRenaissance. As de Chardin states it in his _Phenomenon of Man_ ([p.\n50](ch02.html#page_50)):\n\nWhat ancient thought half perceived and imagined as a natural harmony of\nnumbers, modern science has grasped and converted in the precision of formulae\ndependent on measurement. Indeed, we owe our knowledge of the macro-structure\nand micro-structure of the universe far more to increasingly accurate\nmeasurements than to direct observations. And, again, it is ever bolder\nmeasurements that have revealed to us the calculable conditions to which every\ntransformation of matter is subject according to the force it calls into play.\n\nBack in the visual space in abstraction from the other senses, the Renaissance\nand eighteenth-century world “seemed to rest, static and fragmentable on the\nthree axes of its geometry. Now it is a casting from a single mould.” It is\nnot here a question of values but rather of the need to understand how the\nachievements of the Renaissance were associated with the separation of\nfunctions and senses. But the discovery of the visual techniques of separation\nand static arrest in a traditional milieu of audile-tactile culture was of\nimmense fruitfulness. The same techniques used in a world that has been\nhomogenized by these techniques may have much less advantage. De Chardin says\n([p. 221](ch02b.html#page_221)):\n\nOur habit is to divide up our human world into compartments of different sorts\nof “realities”: natural and artificial, physical and moral, organic and\njuridical, for instance.\n\nIn a space-time, legitimately and perforce extended to include the movements\nof the mind within us, the frontiers between these pairs of opposites tend to\nvanish. Is there after all such a great difference from the point of view of\nthe expansion of life between a vertebrate either spreading its limbs like a\nbat or equipping them with feathers, and an aviator soaring on wings with\nwhich he has had the ingenuity to provide himself?\n\nIt may not be necessary to enlarge here on the role of the infinitesimal\ncalculus as an extension of print technology. More neutral than the alphabet,\ncalculus permits the translation or reduction of any kind of space or motion\nor energy into a uniform repeatable formula. Dantzig explains in his _Number:\nThe Language of Science_ a great step in numeration and calculation taken by\nthe Phoenicians under commercial pressure: “The ordinal numeration in which\nnumbers are represented by the letters of an alphabet in their spoken\nsuccession.” (p 24; see also [p. 221](ch02b.html#page_221).)\n\nBut using letters, Greek and Roman alike never got near a method suited to\narithmetical operations: “This is why, from the beginning of history until the\nadvent of our modern _positional_ numeration, so little progress was made in\nthe art of reckoning.” ([p. 25](ch02.html#page_25)) That is, until number was\ngiven a visual, spatial character and abstracted from its audile-tactile\nmatrix it could not be separated from the magical domain. “A man skilled in\nthe art was regarded as endowed with almost supernatural powers. … even the\nenlightened Greeks never completely freed themselves from this mysticism of\nnumber and form.” ([pp. 25](ch02.html#page_25)–6)\n\nIt is easy to see with Dantzig how the first crisis in mathematics arose with\nthe Greek attempt to apply arithmetic to geometry, to translate one kind of\nspace into another before printing had given the means of homogeneity: “This\nconfusion of tongues persists to this day. Around infinity have grown up all\nthe paradoxes of mathematics: from the arguments of Zeno to the antinomies of\nKant and Cantor.” ([p. 65](ch02.html#page_65)) It is difficult for us in the\ntwentieth century to realize why our predecessors should have had such trouble\nin recognizing the various languages and assumptions of visual as opposed to\naudile-tactile spaces. It was precisely the habit of being with one kind of\nspace that made all other spaces seem so opaque and intractable. From the\neleventh to the fifteenth centuries the Abacists fought the Algorists. That\nis, the literate fought the numbers people. In some places the Arabic numerals\nwere banned. In Italy some merchants of the thirteenth century used them as a\nsecret code. Under manuscript culture the outward appearance of the numerals\nunderwent many changes and, says Dantzig ([p. 34](ch02.html#page_34)): “In\nfact, the numerals did not assume a stable form until the introduction of\nprinting. It can be added parenthetically that so great was the stabilizing\ninfluence of printing that the numerals of today have essentially the same\nappearance as those of the fifteenth century.”\n\n### The great sixteenth century divorce between art and science came with\naccelerated calculators.\n\nPrint assured the victory of numbers or visual position early in the sixteenth\ncentury. By the later sixteenth century the art of statistics was already\ngrowing. Dantzig writes ([p. 16](ch02.html#page_16)):\n\nThe late sixteenth century was the time when in Spain figures were printed\ngiving the population of provinces and the population of towns. It was the\ntime when the Italians also began to take a serious interest in population\nstatistics – in the making of censuses. It was the period when in France a\ncontroversy was carried on between Bodin and a certain Monsieur de Malestroict\nconcerning the relations of the quantity of money in circulation to the level\nof prices.\n\nThere was soon great concern with ways and means of speeding up arithmetical\ncalculations:\n\nIt is hard for us to realize how laborious and slow were the means at the\ndisposal of medieval Europeans for dealing with calculations “which seem to us\nof the simplest character.” The introduction of Arabic numbers into Europe\nprovided more easily manipulated counters than the Roman numbers, and the use\nof Arabic numbers seems to have spread rapidly towards the end of the\nsixteenth century, at least on the Continent. Between about 1590 and 1617 John\nNapier invented his curious “bones” for calculating. He followed this\ninvention with his more celebrated discovery of logarithms. This was widely\nadopted all over Europe almost at once, and in consequence arithmetical\ncalculations were immensely accelerated. ([p. 17](ch02.html#page_17))\n\nThere then occurred an event that dramatizes the separation of letters and\nnumbers in a most striking way. In _Cultural Foundations of Industrial\nCivilization_ ([pp. 17](ch02.html#page_17)–18), Nef cites the studies of\nLucien Febvre concerning the sudden reversal in calculation, so that “the\nancient habit of adding and subtracting from left to right, which still\nprevailed according to Lucien Lefebvre, until the end of the sixteenth\ncentury, began to be superseded by the much quicker way of making them from\nright to left.” That is to say that the separation of letters and numbers\nwhich had taken so long to achieve was finally accomplished by dropping the\nreading habit of left to right in the use of numbers. Nef spends time ([p.\n19](ch02.html#page_19)) trying to resolve the problem of integrating faith,\nart, and science. Religion and art are automatically excluded from a\nquantified, uniform, and homogenous system of thought: “One of the major\ndistinctions that has to be made between the work of the two periods relates\nto the place occupied by faith and art in scientific inquiry. It was hardly\nuntil the later period that they began to lose their importance as the basis\nfor scientific reasoning.”\n\nToday when science also has turned from the segmental to the configurational,\nor structural mode of observation, it is hard to discover the grounds of\ndifficulty and confusion that invested these matters from the sixteenth to the\nnineteenth centuries. It was notably Claude Bernard’s approach to experimental\nmedicine in the later nineteenth century that reconquered the heterogeneous\ndimensions of the _milieu intérieur_ at exactly the same time that Rimbaud and\nBaudelaire shifted poetry to the _paysage intérieur._ But for three centuries\nbefore this the arts and sciences were engaged in the conquest of the _milieu\nextérieur_ by means of new visual quantity and homogeneity derived especially\nfrom the printed word. And it was print that enabled letters and numbers to go\ntheir specialist and divergent ways to the confusion of arts and sciences ever\nsince. But at the start, writes Professor Nef in his _Cultural Foundations of\nIndustrial Civilization_ ([p. 21](ch02.html#page_21)).\n\nThe novel desire, which was then arising, to see nature, including animal and\nhuman bodies, as they appear directly to man’s senses, was of much help to\nscience. The researches of a few great Renaissance artists, who were almost\nuniversal men in the range of their interests and artistic achievements,\nhelped men to see bodies, plants and landscapes afresh in their material\nreality. But the ways in which the artist and the modern scientist employ\nsense impressions to create their independent worlds are fundamentally\ndifferent, and the phenomenal development of science depended partly on a\nseparation of science from art.\n\nThis is only to say that what began as a separation of the senses in science\nbecame the ground of all artistic opposition. The artist struggled to retain\nand to regain the integral, the interplay of sense in a world that was seeking\nmadness by the simple road of isolation of the senses. As was indicated in the\nfirst pages of this book, the theme of _King Lear_ is precisely what Nef is\ndescribing as the origins of modern science.\n\n“Strike flat the thick rotundity of the world,” cries Lear as a curse to snap\n“the most precious square of sense.” And the striking flat, the isolation of\nthe visual is the great achievement of Gutenberg and the Mercator projection.\nAnd Dantzig ([p. 125](ch02a.html#page_125)) notes: “Thus the alleged\nproperties of the straight line are of the geometer’s own making. He\ndeliberately disregards thickness and breadth, deliberately assumes that the\nthing common to two such lines, their point of intersection, is deprived of\nall dimension … but the assumptions themselves are arbitrary, a convenient\nfiction at best.” It is easy for Dantzig to see how fictional classical\ngeometry was. It got huge nourishment from printing after being engendered by\nthe alphabet. And the non-Euclidean geometries familiar to our time also\ndepend on electric technology for their nutriment and plausibility, and this\nis no more seen by mathematicians now than the relations to alphabet and print\nwere seen by mathematicians in the past. It has been assumed till now that so\nlong as everybody is hypnotized by the same isolated sense or spell, that the\nresulting homogeneity of mental states will suffice for human association.\nThat print increasingly hypnotized the Western world is nowadays the theme of\nall historians of art and science alike, because we no longer live under the\nspell of the isolated visual sense. We have not yet begun to ask under what\nnew spell we exist. In place of spell it may be more acceptable to say\n“assumptions” or “parameters” or “frame of reference.” No matter what the\nmetaphor, is it not absurd for men to live involuntarily altered in their\ninmost lives by some mere technological extension of our inner senses? The\nshift in our sense ratios brought about by exteriorizations of our senses is\nnot a situation before which we need be helpless. Computers can now be\nprogrammed for every possible variety of sense ratio. We can then read off\nexactly what would be the resulting cultural assumptions in the arts and\nsciences, of such a new specific ratio as was produced by TV, for example.\n\n### Francis Bacon, PR voice for the **MODERNI** , had both his feet in the\nMiddle Ages.\n\nThroughout _Finnegans Wake_ Joyce specifies the Tower of Babel as the tower of\nSleep, that is, the tower of the witless assumption, or what Bacon calls the\nreign of the Idols. The figure of Francis Bacon has always seemed full of\ncontradictions. As the PR man for modern science, he has been found to have\nboth feet firmly planted in the Middle Ages. His prodigious Renaissance\nreputation baffles those who can find nothing scientific in his method. Much\nmore highbrow than the furious pedagogue Petrus Ramus, he yet shares with\nRamus an extreme visual bias which links him with his relative Roger Bacon in\nthe twelfth century and with Newton in the eighteenth. Everything said so far\nin this book applies as an introduction to Francis Bacon. And without the work\nof Ong, Dantzig, and Nef already introduced, it would not be easy to make\nsense of Bacon. Simply on his own terms, however, he does make sense. He hangs\ntogether once you grant his assumption that Nature is a Book whose pages have\nbeen smudged by the Fall of Man. But because he belongs to the history of\nmodern science nobody has been disposed to grant him his medieval assumptions.\nOng and Nef and Dantzig will have helped to clear this point. The drive\ntowards science was, from the ancient world to the time of Bacon, a drive to\nextricate the visual from the other senses. But this stress was inseparable\nfrom the cultivation of manuscript and print culture. Thus the medievalism of\nBacon would not have been amiss in his time. As Febvre and Martin explain in\n_L’Apparition du livre_ , the first two centuries of print culture were almost\nwholly medieval in _content_. More than ninety per cent of all books printed\nwere of medieval origin. And Professor Nef insists in _Cultural Foundations of\nModern Industrialism_ ([p. 33](ch02.html#page_33)) that it was medieval\nuniversalism or faith in the adequacy of intellect to the understanding of all\ncreated beings that “gave men the courage to read anew the book of nature,\nwhich almost every European assumed had been made by God whom Christ revealed.\n… Leonardo da Vinci and Copernicus and Vesalius were reading that book anew,\nbut they were not the discoverers of the vital new methods of reading it. They\nbelong to what was in the main a transition period from the older science to\nthe new sciences. Their methods of examining natural phenomena were derived\nmainly from the past.”\n\nThus the grandeur of Aquinas is in his explanation of how the modalities of\nBeing are proportional to the modalities of our intellection.\n\nObservation and experiment were not new. What was new was insistence on\ntangible, repeatable, visible proof. Nef writes ([p. 27](ch02.html#page_27)):\n“Such insistence on tangible proofs hardly goes back beyond the times of\nWilliam Gilbert of Colchester, who was born in 1544. In his _De magnete_ ,\npublished in 1600, Gilbert wrote that there was no description or explanation\nin the book that he had not verified several times ‘with his own eyes’.” But\nbefore printing had had a century and more to build up the assumptions of\nuniformity, continuity, and repeatability, such an impulse as Gilbert felt or\nsuch a proof as he offers would have attracted little interest. Bacon himself\nwas aware of the discontinuity between his age and previous history as\nconsisting in the rise of mechanism. He writes in _Novum Organum_ (aphorism\n129):\n\nIt is well to observe the force and effect and consequences of discoveries.\nThese are to be seen nowhere more conspicuously than in those three which were\nunknown to the ancients, and of which the origin, though recent, is obscure;\nnamely, printing, gunpowder, and the magnet. For these three have changed the\nwhole face and state of things throughout the world; the first in literature,\nthe second in warfare, the third in navigation; whence have followed\ninnumerable changes; insomuch that no empire, no sect, no star seems to have\nexerted greater power and influence in human affairs than these mechanical\ninventions.\n\n“With Bacon we enter a new mental climate,” writes Benjamin Farrington in\n_Francis Bacon: Philosopher of Industrial Science_ ([p.\n141](ch02a.html#page_141)). “When we analyze it we find that it consists not\nso much in a scientific advance as in the well-founded confidence that the\nlife of man can be transformed by science.” Farrington is saying that had\nthings turned out less well for man and science he would have had to regard\nBacon’s confidence as so much hot air and blather. A person with some\nacquaintance with Bacon’s medieval roots can make a better case for his\nintellectual plausibility. The very phrase “experimental science” was invented\nand used in the thirteenth century by Roger Bacon of the same family as\nFrancis. Roger makes the full distinction between deductive reasoning,\ninsisting upon particularity of evidence in his discussion of the\nrainbow.[59](ch02a_fn52.html#ch02a_fn52fn59)\n\nBacon was more impressed by the meaning of print as applied knowledge than\nanybody else except Rabelais. The entire Middle Ages had regarded Nature as a\nBook to be scanned for the _vestigia dei._ Bacon took the lesson of print to\nbe that we could now literally get Nature out in a new and improved edition.\nAn encyclopedia is envisaged. It is his complete acceptance of the idea of the\nBook of Nature that makes Bacon so very medieval and so very modern. But the\ngap is this. The medieval Book of Nature was for _contemplatio_ like the\nBible. The Renaissance Book of Nature was for _applicatio_ and use like\nmovable types. A closer look at Francis Bacon will resolve this problem and\nelucidate the transition from the medieval to the modern world.\n\nAnother view of the book as bridge between the medieval and the modern is\ngiven by Erasmus. His new Latin version of the New Testament in 1516 was\nentitled _Novum Organum_ in 1620. Erasmus directed the new print technology to\nthe traditional uses of _grammatica_ and rhetoric and to tidying up the sacred\npage. Bacon used the new technology for an attempt to tidy up the text of\nNature. In the different spirit of these works one can gauge the efficacy of\nprint in preparing the mind for applied knowledge. But such change is not as\nrapid or as thorough as many suppose. Again and again Samuel Eliot Morison in\nhis _Admiral of the Ocean Sea_ is baffled by the inability of Columbus’\nsailors to fend for themselves in the circumstances of the New World:\n“Columbus embraced him, as well he might; for there was not a crust left to\neat aboard the grounded caravels, and the Spaniards were starving. I cannot\nunderstand why they were unable to catch fish …” (p. 643) After all, the point\nof _Robinson Crusoe_ is the very novelty of man as adaptable and resourceful,\nable to translate one kind of experience into new patterns. Defoe’s work is\nthe epic of applied knowledge. In the first age of print people had not yet\nacquired this ability.\n\n\n### **A strange wedding of the medieval Book of Nature and the new book from\nmovable types was conducted by Francis Bacon.**\n\nIn order to clarify Bacon’s strange ideas about science and the text of the\nBook of Nature a brief look at this idea in the Middle Ages is necessary.\nErnst Robert Curtius has taken up the subject of “The Book as Symbol” in\nchapter XVI of _European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages_. Greece and\nRome had made little use of book symbol or metaphor, and it “was through\nChristianity that the book received its highest consecration. Christianity was\na religion or the Holy Book. Christ is the only god whom antique art\nrepresents with a book-scroll. … The Old Testament itself contained a large\nstock of metaphors from the book.” ([p. 130](ch02a.html#page_130)) It is\nnaturally with the coming of paper in the twelfth century and the ensuing\nincrease of books that there is also an efflorescence of book metaphors.\nCurtius dips here and there among the poets and theologians and begins his\nsection on the Book of Nature ([pp. 319](ch04.html#page_319)–20):\n\nIt is a favorite cliché of the popular view of history that the Renaissance\nshook off the dust of yellowed parchments and began instead to read in the\nbook of nature or the world. But this metaphor itself derives from the Latin\nMiddle Ages. We saw that Alan speaks of the “book of experience.” … Omnis\nmundi creatura / Quasi liber et pictura / Nobis est et speculum. In later\nauthors, especially the homilists, “scientia creaturarum” and “liber naturae”\nappear as synonyms. For the preacher the book of nature must figure with the\nBible as a source of material.\n\nHowever, it is in Dante himself, according to Curtius ([p.\n326](ch04.html#page_326)), that “the entire book imagery of Middle Ages is\nbrought together, intensified, broadened … from the first paragraph of the\n_Vita Nuova_ to the last canto of the _Divina Commedia_. In fact, the very\nconcept of _summa_ inherent in all medieval organization of knowledge is the\nsame as that of textbook: “Now to reading conceived as the form of reception\nand study, corresponds writing as the form of production and creation. The two\nconcepts belong together. In the intellectual world of the Middle Ages they\nrepresent, as it were, the two halves of a sphere. The unity of this world was\nshattered by the invention of printing.” ([p. 328](ch05.html#page_328)) And as\nthe work of Hajnal showed earlier, the oral training involved in writing and\nreading constituted much more of a cultural unity for the book than Curtius\nsuspects. Printing, Curtius sees, split apart the roles of producer and\nconsumer. But it also created the means and the motive for _applied_\nknowledge. The means creates the want.\n\nIt was this homiletic use of the book of nature, the mirror of St. Paul in\nwhich we now see in _aenigmatate_ , that enthroned Pliny as a resource of\ngrammatical exegesis from St. Augustine forward. Summing up, Curtius finds\n([p. 321](ch04.html#page_321)) “that the concept of the world or nature as a\n“book” originated in pulpit eloquence, was then adopted by medieval mystico-\nphilosophical speculation, and finally passed into common usage.”\n\nCurtius then turns ([p. 322](ch04.html#page_322)) to Renaissance writers like\nMontaigne, Descartes, Thomas Browne, who took over the book metaphor, and\nBacon: “The theological concept is preserved by Francis Bacon: “Num salvator\nnoster inquit: Erratis nescientes Scripturas et potentiam Dei (Matt. 22, 29),\nubi duos libros, ne inerrores, proponit nobis evolvendos. (_De Augmentis\nScientiarum_ , Bk. I.)” Since, however, our present goal is merely to relate\nBacon’s notion of science to the medieval tradition of the two Scriptures of\nRevelation and Nature, it is possible to limit discussion to _The Advancement\nof Learning_ readily accessible in the Everyman edition. Here, too, Bacon\nmakes use of the same text from Matthew ([pp. 41](ch02.html#page_41)–2):\n\n… for as the Psalms and other Scriptures do often invite us to consider and\nmagnify the great and wonderful works of God, so if we should rest only in the\ncontemplation of the exterior of them, as they first offer themselves to our\nsenses, we should do a like injury unto the Majesty of God, as if we should\njudge or construe of the store of some excellent jeweller, by that only which\nis set out toward the street in his shop. The other, because they minister a\nsingular help and preservative against unbelief and error: for our Saviour\nsaith, _You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God_ ; laying\nbefore us two books or volumes to study, if we will be secured from error;\nfirst, the Scriptures, revealing the Will of God; and then the creatures\nexpressing His Power; whereof the latter is a key unto the former: not only\nopening our understanding to conceive the true sense of the Scriptures, by the\ngeneral notions of reason and rules of speech; but chiefly opening our belief,\nin drawing us into a due meditation of the omnipotency of God, which is\nchiefly signed and engraven upon His works. Thus much therefore for divine\ntestimony and evidence concerning the true dignity and value of Learning.\n\nThe next passage gives Bacon’s ever-recurrent theme that all of the arts are\nforms of applied knowledge for the sake of diminishing the effects of the\nFall:\n\nConcerning speech and words, the consideration of them hath produced the\nscience of grammar: for man still striveth to reintegrate himself in those\nbenedictions, from which by his fault he hath been deprived; and as he hath\nstriven against the first general curse by the invention of all other arts, so\nhath he sought to come forth of the second general curse, which was the\nconfusion of tongues, by the art of grammar; whereof the use in a mother\ntongue is small, in a foreign tongue more; but most in such foreign tongues as\nhave ceased to be vulgar tongues, and are turned only to learned tongues. ([p.\n138](ch02a.html#page_138))\n\nIt is the Fall of Man which engenders the arts of applied knowledge for the\nrelief of man’s fallen estate:\n\nSo in the age before the flood, the holy records within those few memorials\nwhich are there entered and registered have vouchsafed to mention and honour\nthe name of the inventors and authors of music and works in metal. In the age\nafter the flood, the first great judgment of God upon the ambition of man was\nthe confusion of tongues; whereby the open trade and intercourse of learning\nand knowledge was chiefly imbarred. ([p. 38](ch02.html#page_38))\n\nBacon has the utmost regard for the kind of work done by unfallen man (p.37):\n\nAfter the creation was finished, it is set down unto us that man was placed in\nthe garden to work therein; which work, so appointed to him, could be no other\nthan work of Contemplation; that is, when the end of work is but for exercise\nand experiment, not for necessity; for there being then no reluctation of the\ncreature, nor sweat of the brow, man’s employment must of consequence have\nbeen matter of delight in the experiment, and not matter of labour for the\nuse. Again, the first acts which man performed in Paradise consisted of the\ntwo summary parts of knowledge; the view of creatures, and the imposition of\nnames. As for the knowledge which induced the fall, it was, as was touched\nbefore, not the natural knowledge of creatures, but the moral knowledge of\ngood and evil, but that they had other beginnings, which man aspired to know;\nto the end to make a total defection from God and to depend wholly upon\nhimself.\n\n### **Bacon’s Adam is a medieval mystic and Milton’s a trade union\norganizer.**\n\nBefore the Fall the purpose of work was just for experience or “experiment,”\n“not for necessity,” “nor matter of labour for the use.” Strangely, although\nBacon is quite explicit and repetitive in his derivation of the program of\napplied knowledge from the Scriptures, his commentators have avoided this\nissue. Bacon pushes Revelation into every part of his program stressing, not\nonly the parallelism between the book of Nature and of Revelation, but also\nbetween the methods used in both.\n\nBacon’s Adam would seem to correspond to Shakespeare’s poet, using his\nunblemished intuition to pierce all mysteries and to name them like a\nnominalist magician:\n\nThe poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,  \nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;  \nAnd as imagination bodies forth  \nThe forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen  \nTurns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing  \nA local habitation and a name.[60](ch02b_fn53.html#ch02b_fn53fn60)\n\nBy comparison, Milton’s unfallen Adam is a harassed agricultural labourer:\n\nThen commune how that day they best may ply  \nTheir growing work – for much their work outgrew  \nThe hands’ dispatch of two gardening so wide:\n[61](ch02b_fn53.html#ch02b_fn53fn61)\n\nMilton must have some ironic intent.\n\nBacon’s conception of applied knowledge concerns the means of restoring the\ntext of the Book of Nature which has been defaced by the Fall, even as our\nfaculties have been impaired. Just as Bacon strives to mend the text of Nature\nby his Histories, so he sought to repair our faculties by his _Essays or\nCounsels, Civil and Moral_ , or public and private. The broken mirror or glass\nof our minds no longer lets “light through” but enchants us with broken\nlights, besetting us with Idols.\n\nJust as Bacon draws on traditional inductive _grammatica_ for his exegesis of\nthe two books of Nature and Revelation, so he relies heavily on the Ciceronian\nconception of eloquence as applied knowledge, explicitly uniting Cicero and\nSolomon in this regard. In the _Novum Organum_ ([pp.\n181](ch02a.html#page_181)–2) he writes:\n\nNeither needeth it at all to be doubted, that this knowledge should be so\nvariable as it falleth not under precept; for it is much less infinite than\nscience of government, which, we see, is laboured and in some part reduced. Of\nthis wisdom, it seemeth some of the ancient Romans in the saddest and wisest\ntimes were professors; for Cicero reporteth that it was then in use for\nsenators that had name and opinion for general wise men, as Coruncanius,\nCurius, Laelius, and many others, to walk at certain hours in the Place, and\nto give audience to those that would use their advice; and that the particular\ncitizens would resort unto them, and consult with them of the marriage of a\ndaughter, or of the employing of a son, or of a purchase or bargain, or of an\naccusation, and every other occasion incident to man’s life. So as there is a\nwisdom of counsel and advice even in private causes, arising out of a\nuniversal insight into the affairs of the world; which is used indeed upon\nparticular causes propounded, but is gathered by general observation of cases\nof like nature. For so we see in the book which Q. Cicero writeth to his\nbrother, _De petitione consulatus_ , (being the only book of business that I\nknow written by the ancients,) although it concerned a particular action set\non foot, yet the substance thereof consisteth of many wise and politic axioms,\nwhich contain not a temporary, but a perpetual direction in the case of\npopular elections. But chiefly we may see in those aphorisms which have place\namong divine writings, composed by Salomon the king, (of whom the Scriptures\ntestify that his heart was as the sands of the sea, encompassing the world and\nall worldly matters, we see, I say, not a few profound and excellent cautions,\nprecepts, positions, extending to much variety of occasions; whereupon we will\nstay awhile, offering to consideration some number of examples.\n\nBacon has much to say of Solomon as the forerunner of himself. In fact, he\nderives ([pp. 39](ch02.html#page_39)–40) his pedagogical theory of aphorism\nfrom Solomon:\n\nSo like wise in the person of Salomon the King, we see the gift or endowment\nof wisdom and learning, both in Salomon’s petition and in God’s assent\nthereunto, preferred before all other terrene and temporal felicity. By virtue\nof which grant or donative of God Salomon became enabled not only to write\nthose excellent Parables or Aphorisms concerning divine and moral philosophy;\nbut also to compile a Natural History of all verdure, from the cedar upon the\nmountain to the moss upon the wall (which is but a rudiment between\nputrefaction and a herb), and also of all things that breathe or move. Nay,\nthe same Salomon the King, although he excelled in the glory of treasure and\nmagnificent buildings, of shipping and navigation, of service and attendance,\nof fame and renown, and the like, yet he maketh no claim to any of those\nglories, but only to the glory of inquisition of truth; for so he saith\nexpressly, _The glory of God is to conceal a thing, but the glory of the king\nis to find it out_ ; as if, according to the innocent play of children, the\nDivine Majesty took delight to hide His works, to the end to have them found\nout; and as if kings could not obtain a greater honour than to be God’s\nplayfellows in that game; considering the great commandment of wits and means,\nwhereby nothing needeth to be hidden from them.\n\nBacon’s allusion to scientific discovery as a children’s game brings us close\nto another of his basic notions, that as man lost his Eden through pride he\nmust regain it by humility:\n\nSo much concerning the several classes of Idols, and their equipage: all of\nwhich must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination,\nand the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed; the entrance into the\nkingdom of man, founded on the sciences, being not much other than the\nentrance into the kingdom of heaven, where into none may enter except as a\nlittle child.[62](ch02b_fn54.html#ch02b_fn54fn62)\n\nEarlier in the _Essays_ ([pp. 289](ch02b.html#page_289)–90), Bacon insisted in\nthe same way that “the course I propose for the discovery of sciences is such\nas leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits, but places all\nwits and understandings nearly on a level.” Print had inspired Bacon not only\nwith the idea of applied knowledge by means of the homogeneity of segmental\nprocedure, but it gave him the assurance that men would be levelled in their\ncapacities and performance as well. Some strange speculations have resulted\nfrom this doctrine, but few would care to dispute the power of print to level\nand to extend the learning process as much as cannon or ordnance did level\ncastles and feudal privilege. Bacon, then, argues that the text of Nature can\nbe restored by great encyclopedic fact-finding sweeps. Man’s wits can be\nreconstructed so that they can once again mirror the perfected Book of Nature.\nHis mind is now an enchanted glass, but the hex can be removed.\n\nIt is quite clear, then, that Bacon would have no respect for scholasticism\nany more than for the dialectics of Plato and Aristotle “because it is the\nduty of Art to perfect and exalt Nature; but they contrariwise have wronged,\nabused, and traduced Nature.”[63](ch02b_fn55.html#ch02b_fn55fn63)\n\n### **How far did the mass-produced page of print become a substitute for\nauricular confession?**\n\nEarly in _The Advancement of Learning_ ([p. 23](ch02.html#page_23)), Bacon has\na compact history of Renaissance prose that illuminates the role of printing\nindirectly:\n\nMartin Luther, conducted no doubt by a higher providence, but in discourse of\nreason finding what a providence he had undertaken against the bishop of Rome\nand the degenerate traditions of the church, and finding his own solitude,\nbeing no ways aided by the opinion of his own time, was enforced to awake all\nantiquity, and to call former times to his succours to make a party against\nthe present time. So that the ancient authors, both in divinity and in\nhumanity, which had long time slept in libraries, began generally to be read\nand revolved. Thus by consequence did draw on a necessity of a more exquisite\ntravail in the languages original, wherein those authors did write, for the\nbetter understanding of those authors, and the better advantage of pressing\nand applying their words. And thereof grew again a delight in their manner of\nstyle and phrase, and an admiration of that kind of writing; which was much\nfurthered and precipitated by the enmity and opposition that the propounders\nof those primitive but seeming new opinions had against the schoolmen; who\nwere generally of the contrary part, and whose writings were altogether in a\ndifferent style and form; taking liberty to coin and frame new terms of art to\nexpress their own sense, and to avoid circuit of speech, without regard to the\npureness, pleasantness, and, as I may call it, lawfulness of the phrase or\nword.\n\nBacon says here that the entire humanist effort in languages and historical\nrevival was incidental to religious differences. The printing presses made\navailable authors of remote times. People began to imitate their styles. The\nschoolmen had such a technical terse way that they fell quite out of fashion,\nbeing utterly unable to develop any popularity with the new reading public.\nThe growing public could only be won by flowery rhetoric and, Bacon goes on to\nsay ([p. 24](ch02.html#page_24)):\n\nfor the winning and persuading of them, there grew of necessity in chief price\nand request eloquence and variety of discourse, as the fittest and forciblest\naccess into the capacity of the vulgar sort: so that these four causes\nconcurring, the admiration of ancient authors, the hate of the schoolmen, the\nexact study of languages, and the efficacy of preaching, did bring in an\naffectionate study of eloquence and copie of speech, which then began to\nflourish. This grew speedily to an excess; for men began to hunt more after\nwords than matter; more after the choiceness of the phrase, and the round and\nclean composition of the sentence, and the sweet falling of the clauses, and\nthe varying and illustration of their works with tropes and figures, than\nafter the weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of argument, life of\ninvention or depth of judgment. Then grew the flowing and watery vein of\nOsorius the Portugal bishop, to be in price. Then did Sturmius spend such\ninfinite and curious pains upon Cicero the Orator, and Hermogenes the\nRhetorician, besides his own books of Periods and Imitation, and the like.\nThen did Car of Cambridge, and Ascham with their lectures and writings almost\ndeify Cicero and Demosthenes, and allure all young men that were studious,\nunto that delicate and polished kind of learning. Then did Erasmus take\noccasion to make the scoffing Echo: _decem annos consumpsi in legendo\nCicerone_ ; and the Echo answered in Greek, _8VE Asine_. Then grew the\nlearning of the schoolmen to be utterly despised as barbarous. In sum, the\nwhole inclination and bent of those times was rather towards copie than\nweight.\n\nThere in a page or so Bacon renders a detailed image of the literary struggles\nand fashions of his day. Like his idea of scientific methods, his idea of the\nliterary scene is rooted in religion. His outline of a history of English\nprose has yet to be examined seriously by literary historians. When, for\nexample, Bacon says: “Then grew the learning of the Schoolmen to be utterly\ndespised as barabarous” he does not say that he himself despises it. He has no\nrespect for the ornate and affected eloquence that was currently trumped up.\n\nAfter this outline of some of the features of applied knowledge in Bacon’s\nmedievalism, it is time to consider some of the applications of print\ntechnology to individual and national life. And here it is necessary to\nconsider writers and the vernaculars as shaped by the new extension of the\nvisual image by means of the press.\n\nSome writers have recently suggested that we can almost regard the whole of\ncreative writing since the Renaissance as an externalization of the medieval\nconfessional. In his _Anatomy of Criticism_ ([p. 307](ch03.html#page_307))\nNorthrop Frye points to the strong autobiographic strain in prose fiction,\n“following St. Augustine who appears to have invented it, and Rousseau who\nestablished a modern type of it. The earlier tradition gave _Religio Medici_ ,\n_Grace Abounding_ , and Newman’s _Apologia_ to English literature, besides the\nrelated but subtly different type of confession favored by the mystics.”\n\nIn particular the sonnet as a new form of public confessional fostered by\nprint, is worth study as it relates to new verse forms. Wordsworth’s familiar\nsonnet on the sonnet strikes some main notes of _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ :\n\nScorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned,  \nMindless of its just honours; with this key  \nShakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody  \nOf this small lute gave ease to Petrarch’s wound;  \nA thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;  \nWith it Camöens soothed an exile’s grief;  \nThe Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf  \nAmid the cypress with which Dante crowned  \nHis visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,  \nIt cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land  \nTo struggle through dark ways; and, when a damp  \nFell round the path of Milton, in his hand  \nThe Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew  \nSoul-animating strains – alas, too few!\n\nMany a trumpet solo was delivered by the press medium which would else never\nhave been composed. The mere existence of the press created the need and\npossibility of new expression at the same time:\n\nLoving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,\n\nThat she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain, –\n\nPleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,\n\nKnowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain, –\n\nI sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe;\n\nStudying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,\n\nOft turning others’ leaves to see if thence would flow\n\nSome fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn’d brain.\n\nBut words came halting forth, wanting Invention’s stay;\n\nInvention, Nature’s child, fled step-dame Study’s blows,\n\nAnd others’ feet still seem’d but strangers in my way.\n\nThus, great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,\n\nBiting my truant pen, beating myself for spite;\n\n“Fool,” said my Muse to me, “look in thy heart, and\nwrite.”[64](ch02b_fn56.html#ch02b_fn56fn64)\n\n### **Aretino, like Rabelais and Cervantes, proclaimed the meaning\n\nof Typography as Gargantuan, Fantastic, Supra-human.**\n\nThe outering or uttering of mind under manuscript conditions, was, as we have\nseen, very restricted. The poet or author was far from being able to use the\nvernacular as a public address system. With print the discovery of the\nvernacular as a PA system was immediate. The figure of Pietro Aretino\n(1492–1556) will serve to illuminate this sudden development. He also\nillustrates the sudden reversal of the private self-accusation, of the\nconfessional, into public denunciation of others. Aretino was known in his\ntime as “the scourge of Princes”:\n\nHe was monster, it is true: to deny that is to belittle him; but above all he\nwas a man of his day, perhaps the most free and complete expression of the age\nin which he lived – the sixteenth century. That, and his enormous ability,\ntogether with the fact that he founded the modern press and used the hitherto\nunsuspected weapon of publicity with an incomparable appreciation of its\npower, are his chief claims upon our\nnotice.[65](ch02b_fn57.html#ch02b_fn57fn65)\n\nBorn two years after Rabelais, he was, like Rabelais, just in time to seize\nthe new instrument of the press. He became a one-man newspaper, a single-\nhanded Northcliffe.\n\nHe is, in a sense, in his “yellow” proclivities, the forerunner of Mr. Hearst,\nLord Northcliffe and others, while he is also the father of the awful tribe of\nmodern press agents, who, when they wish to put on airs, become “publicists.”\nIt is his boast that throughout the world, “Fame is sold by me.” He had to\nhave publicity; it was his living; and he certainly knew how to set about to\nget it. … Here, then, we have a man who may be called, in point of chronology,\nthe first literary realist, the first journalist, the first publicist, the\nfirst art critic.[66](ch02b_fn57.html#ch02b_fn57fn66)\n\nLike his exact contemporary Rabelais, Aretino sensed the gigantism that is\nlatent in the uniformity and repeatability of the printed word. Aretino, from\nlowly origins and without education, used the press as it has been used ever\nsince. Putnam writes (p 37):\n\nIf Aretino, at this time, was probably the most powerful man in Italy, perhaps\nin the world, the reason is to be found in the new force which he had\ndiscovered, that force which we today would call “the power of the press.”\nAretino himself regarded it as the power of his pen. He himself did not\nrealize the right Promethean fire with which he was playing. All he knew was\nthat he had a tremendous instrument in his hands, and he employed it quite as\nunscrupulously as it, consistently, has been employed since his time. He was\ncapable – see his _Letters_ –of being quite as hypocritical as the press of\ntoday.\n\nPutnam goes on ([p. 41](ch02.html#page_41)) to mention that Aretino was\n“perhaps the greatest blackmailer in all history, the first truly modern\nexponent of the ‘poison pen.’” That is to say, Aretino really regarded the\nprinting press as a public confessional with himself as Father Confessor, pen\nor microphone in hand. Hutton cites Aretino on page xiv of his study: “Let\nothers worry themselves about style and so cease to be themselves. Without a\nmaster, without a model, without a guide, without artifice I go to work and\nearn my living, my well-being and my fame. What do I need more? With a goose-\nquill and a few sheets of paper I mock myself of the universe.”\n\nWe shall return to his “without a model, without a guide,” for it was\nliterally true. The press was an instrument without precedent. It had no\nwriters and no reading public of its own, and had for a long time to make do\nwith the kind of writer and public created by manuscript conditions. As Febvre\nand Martin explain in _L’Apparition du livre_ , the press had to rely on\nmedieval manuscripts almost entirely for the first two centuries. As for the\nrole of author, it did not exist, so the writer tried on various masks of\npreacher and clown for the first two centuries, discovering the role of “man\nof letters” only in the eighteenth century:\n\n_Jaques_. … I must have liberty\n\nWithal, as large a charter as the wind,\n\nTo blow on whom I please; for so fools have.\n\nAnd they that are most galled with my folly,\n\nThey most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?\n\nThe why is plain as way to parish church:\n\nHe that a fool doth very wisely hit\n\nDoth very foolishly, although he smart,\n\nNot to seem senseless of the bob. If not,\n\nThe wise man’s folly is anatomiz’d\n\nEven by the squand’ring glances of the fool.\n\nInvest me in my motley. Give me leave\n\nTo speak my mind, and I will through and through\n\nCleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,\n\nIf they will patiently receive my\nmedicine.[67](ch02b_fn58.html#ch02b_fn58fn67)\n\nThough engaged in this cathartic enterprise, Shakespeare felt the absence of\nrole bitterly. In his Sonnet CX, we read:\n\nAlas, ’tis true I have gone here and there  \nAnd made myself a motley to the view,  \nGor’d mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, …\n\nHe was little attracted into the print mode and made no effort to publish,\nsince the circulation of his work in print form would have conferred no\ndignity on him. It was quite otherwise for the writer in divinity. When Ben\nJonson published his plays as the _Works_ of Ben Jonson in 1616, there was\nmuch derisive comment.\n\nIt is interesting that Shakespeare should comment on the confessional aspect\nof authorship, “sold cheap what is most dear,” for whether as actor or\nplaywright his going “here and there” would have seemed the same to him. And\nit is this confessional pouring forth of private news and views that seemed to\nAretino and his contemporaries to warrant the association of the press with\npornography and filth. This is the view that dominates Pope’s _Dunciad_ in the\nearly eighteenth century. But for Aretino the switching of private confession\ninto public accusation was a perfectly natural response to the print\ntechnology.\n\nIndeed, remarks Raimondi, Aretino “is a prostitute.” He has the prostitute’s\ninstinct of social rebellion. “He throws mud not merely in the face of his\ncontemporaries, but of a whole past. It would seem that he lifts up the world\nand places it against the light of the sun. … All is obscene and libidinous,\neverything is for sale, everything is false, nothing is sacred. He himself\nmakes merchandise of sacred things to gain money and writes romantic lives of\nthe saints. And then? Like Nanna, like Pippa, he finds it convenient to stand\nabove men and hold them with the reins of their own vices. … The discipline\nwhich Nanna gives to Pippa is the discipline which guided the life of\nAretino.”[68](ch02b_fn59.html#ch02b_fn59fn68)\n\n### **Marlowe anticipated Whitman’s barbaric yawp by setting up a national PA\nsystem of blank verse – a rising iambic system of sound to suit the new\nsuccess story.**\n\nIt is necessary to keep in mind that print created gigantism not only for the\nauthor and for the vernaculars, but for markets. And the sudden expansion of\nenlarged markets and commerce under the inspiration of this first form of\nmass-production, seemed to be a visible extension of all the latent venalities\nof mankind. This then is not the least of the effects of playing up the visual\ncomponent in human experience. The technique of translation that is _applied_\nknowledge is impartially advanced to include the hidden crimes and motives of\nmankind in a new form of self-expression. Because print is visually a greatly\nintensified form of the written word, it is insatiable for intense or\nsensational materials to broadcast. This fact is no more basic for the\nunderstanding of current newspapers than for an appreciation of what was\nhappening to language and expression in the sixteenth century:\n\nIt is because Aretino is a man of genius, and because he sums up and expresses\nthat disastrous age of anarchy, its complete moral disorder and collapse, its\ndelight in insulting and disregarding the past, its repudiation of every\nancient authority and tradition, that he is worth studying. And if we add to\nthis that he contrived a weapon for his own ends which has in our own day come\nto be more powerful than any established government or elected parliament or\nhereditary monarchy – publicity, the Press – there is more than sufficient\nexcuse for this book.[69](ch02b_fn60.html#ch02b_fn60fn69)\n\nPrint as a public address system that gave huge power of amplification to the\nindividual voice, soon made itself a new form of expression, namely the\nElizabethan popular drama. The opening lines of the very popular _Tamburlaine\nthe Great_ by Christopher Marlowe provides all our new themes:\n\nFrom jigging veins of rhyming mother-wits,  \nAnd such conceits as clownage keeps in pay,  \nWe’ll lead you to the stately tent of war,  \nWhere you shall hear the Scythian Tamburlaine  \nThreatening the world with high astounding terms,  \n. . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . .  \nView but his picture in this tragic glass.  \nAnd then applaud his fortunes as you please.\n\nThe first speaker, Mycetas, follows this with equally indicative words:\n\nBrother Cosroe, I find myself aggriev’d;  \nYet insufficient to express the same,  \nFor it requires a great and thundering speech:\n\nWhat is especially significant is the discovery of blank verse as a\nbroadcasting megaphone and the consciousness that jigging rhymes cannot\nprovide the sweep and volume of public utterance that is resonating in the new\nage. Blank verse to the Elizabethan was as exciting a novelty as the “close\nup” in a Griffith’s movie, and the two are much alike in the intensity of\namplification and exaggeration of feeling. Even Whitman, impelled by the new\nvisual intensities of the newspaper of his time, did not devise a louder\nvehicle for his barbaric yawp than blank verse. Nobody has been willing to\noffer a theory of the origin of English blank verse. It has no antecedents or\nexemplars except, perhaps, in the long melodic line of medieval music. I do\nnot think Kenneth Sisam’s idea of Old English meter has any bearing on blank\nverse. He writes in _Fourteenth Century Verse and Prose_ (p. xiii): “Old\nEnglish had a single metre – the long alliterative line without rime. It was\nbest suited to narrative; it was unmusical in the sense that it could not be\nsung; it had marked proclivities toward rant and noise.”\n\nBut the paradox is that the blank verse, being one of the first kinds of\n“spoken,” as opposed to sung, poetry is very much faster than song, or perhaps\neven than speech itself. It is very safe, however, to commence with the\nconsideration that blank verse, unlike rhymed poetry, answered the new need of\nthe vernacular to have recognition and implementation as a public address\nsystem. Aretino had been the first to seize the vernacular as the mass medium\nwhich print had made it. His biographers note his extraordinary resemblance to\nthe most vulgar press lords and emperors of our own century. Reviewing a\nbiography _Citizen Hearst_ by W. A. Swanberg, the _New York Times_ headlined\nthe review (September 10, 1961): “The Man Who Made Headlines Scream.”\n\nBlank verse was a means to make English roar and resonate in a way suited to\nthe new extension and consolidation of the vernacular by typography. In our\nown century as the vernacular has met the non-verbal competition of photo,\nfilm, and television, a reverse effect has occurred. It was strikingly noted\nby Simone de Beauvoir in _The Mandarins_ : “What a derisory triumph, to be a\ngreat writer of Guatemala or Hunduras! Yesterday he had thought himself the\ninhabitant of a privileged part of the world, from which every sound\nreverberated through the entire globe; but now he knew that his words died at\nhis feet.”\n\nWhat an extraordinary insight this passage affords into the Gutenberg era and\ninto blank verse! It is not strange that literary research has failed to\nreveal the origins of blank verse. Equally fruitless would be the seeking the\norigins of the long lines of the Roman road in engineering antecedents. The\nRoman road was a by-product of papyrus and fast-moving couriers. Cesare\nFolingo has the necessary approach to this kind of problem when writing on\n“Vernacular Literature” in _The Legacy of the Middle Ages_ ([p.\n182](ch02a.html#page_182)): “Rome had produced no popular epics. … These\nundaunted builders were wont to construct their epics in stone; miles and\nmiles of paved roads … must have possessed an almost emotional appeal such as\nthe long sequences of single rhymed lines may have had for the French.”\n\n### **Print, in turning the vernaculars into mass media, or closed systems,\ncreated the uniform, centralizing forces of modern nationalism.**\n\nThe French, more than any other modern nation, have felt the unifying force of\ntheir vernacular as a national experience. It is fitting that they should be\nthe first to record the break-up of this typographically created unity under\nthe impact of non-verbal media. In the electronic age Simone de Beauvoir and\nJean-Paul Sartre declaim in tragic mode in _What is Literature?_ the dilemma\nof “For whom does one write?”\n\nAn editorial comment on Simone de Beauvoir in _Encounter_ (August, 1955) helps\nvery much to relate the new clamorous voices of the Gutenberg era with the\nphenomenon of nationalism. The editor is considering the nature of fame and\nenduring reputation:\n\n… and to obtain this it is almost necessary, in our age, to be a member of a\nnational community that has, along with whatever moral and aesthetic\nexcellences, the quite vulgar quality of being in some degree powerful – of\nbeing regarded attentively by the world and, most important, listened to. The\nexistence of such a community seems to be a precondition for the emergence of\na national literature sufficiently large in extent and weighty in substance to\nfix the world’s eye and give shape to the world’s imagination; … it was the\nwriters themselves who helped call into being this thing called “national\nliterature.” At first, their activity had a pleasing artlessness about it, …\nLater under the spell of the Romantic movement, moribund languages were\nrevived, new national epics were composed for nations that as yet barely\nexisted, while literature enthusiastically ascribed to the idea of national\nexistence the most supernatural virtues, …\n\nClosely interrelated, then, by the operation and effects of typography are the\noutering or uttering of private inner experience and the massing of collective\nnational awareness, as the vernacular is rendered visible, central, and\nunified by the new technology.\n\nIt is quite consistent that Chaucer, as much as Dryden, should have preferred\nthe couplet as an intimate mode of conversation among friends. In this way the\nChaucerian couplet would have struck St. Thomas More as quite close in\ncharacter to the scholastic dialogue, much as the couplet of Pope and Dryden\npreserved the character of the Senecan amble. The important text of More cited\nearlier makes the proper distinction between rhyme and blank verse when he\ncontrasts scholastic philosophy as “not unpleasant among friends in familiar\ncommunication,” and the new modes of discourse for the “councils of Kings,\nwhere great matters be debated and reasoned with great authority.” More is\ntalking of the centralist and nationalistic political organizations which were\nnew in his day. For these new forms of gigantism the blank verse of Marlowe\nwas the objective correlative:\n\n_Cheridamas_ : Tamburlaine!\n\nA Scythian shepherd so embellished\n\nWith nature’s pride and richest furniture!\n\nHis looks do menace heaven and dare the gods;\n\nHis fiery eyes are fix’d upon the earth,\n\nAs if he now devis’d some stratagem,\n\nOr meant to pierce Avernus’ darksome vaults\n\nTo pull the triple-headed dog from hell.[70](ch02b_fn61.html#ch02b_fn61fn70)\n\n### **The divorce of poetry and music was first reflected by the printed\npage.**\n\nCommenting on the melodic line of the Troubadours in _Music and Society_ ([p.\n29](ch02.html#page_29)) Wilfred Mellers provides a counter-point from which to\nobserve the precipitate forward drive of Marlowe:\n\nThe immense length and arching plasticity of line in all these musics is\nevidence of the advantages, counterbalancing the obvious limitations, of music\nconceived in terms of a single line; if one sacrifices the possibilities of\nharmony and sonorous contrast, one gains the possibility of creating melody\nfree of the inhibitions of mensuration. There is no limit to the subtleties of\nphrase, intonation and nuance one may use, except the limits implicit in the\ncreation of a coherent linear organization.\n\nSong is the slowing down of speech in order to savour nuance. Blank verse\noriginated in an age that first split words and music asunder and which moved\ntowards the specialist autonomy of musical instruments. According to Mellers,\nthe role of polyphony was to break up the ancient monodic line. And polyphony\nwas to have effects in music comparable to movable types and mechanical\nwriting in language and literature. For especially after the printing of music\nquantification and measurement became necessary as a means of keeping the\nsingers of various parts together. But medieval polyphony only had these\nseparate parts and quantities in latency. Mellers writes ([p.\n31](ch02.html#page_31)):\n\nIt seems possible that polyphony was in the first place a largely unconscious\nresult of certain accidents that may occur in unison monophonic singing; it is\ncertainly not surprising that during the later Middle Ages polyphony should be\nso deeply rooted in what are essentially mono-phonic attitudes that people of\nthe modern world find it, at first at least, curiously difficult of approach.\nWe know more or less what we expect from music conceived in “parts,” and the\nmediaeval composer does not gratify our expectations. But before we dismiss\nhim as “primitive” or “tentative” we ought to be sure that we understand what\nhe thought he was trying to do. He was not really trying to break with the\nimplications of the monophonic music on which he had been nurtured and which,\nas we have seen, symbolized the philosophy inherent in his world; he was\nperhaps trying to extend that music’s resources, and in so doing he quite\nunwittingly introduced conceptions which were to produce a profound technical\nrevolution.\n\nBruce Pattison’s excellent study of _Music and Poetry of the English\nRenaissance_ stresses that “song-form was virtually the only form up to the\nseventeenth century” ([p. 83](ch02.html#page_83)). But song-form having been\nfor centuries inseparable from narrative and lineal development of themes, it\npenetrated and shaped literary practice as well. What we might call the story\nor “narrative line” today is not much more discernible in Nashe than in the\nOld Testament. Rather such a “line” is embedded in multitudinous effects of\nlanguage. This quality of simultaneous interplay or tactile sensuousness is\nprominent in medieval music. As Pattison puts it ([p. 82](ch02.html#page_82)),\n“In a sense medieval music is often instrumental in conception, although it is\nnot certain what part instruments took in its performance. Attention was\nlargely concentrated on the sensuous effect of combining different voices\nrather than on the sentiments of the text or indeed on emotional expression at\nall.”\n\n### **The oral polyphony of the prose of Nashe offends against lineal and\nliterary decorum.**\n\nThis sensuous relish for the complex interplay of qualities persists in the\nsixteenth century even in language intended for the printed page. And James\nSutherland in _On English Prose_ ([p. 49](ch02.html#page_49)) mistakes this\npolyphony in Nashe for a failure to be a sensible man of letters: “The trouble\nwith Nashe is partly that he is a good deal less interested in making things\neasy for the reader than in enjoying his own superiority over him; or, if that\nseems too harsh a judgment, in exploiting the linguistic resources of the\nlanguage for his own amusement.” Read aloud by a trained rhetorician from the\nnew grammar schools, the passage which Sutherland quotes ([pp.\n49](ch02.html#page_49)–50) takes on the brash variety of a Louis Armstrong\ntrumpet solo:\n\nHero hoped, and therefore she dreamed (as all hope is but a dream); her hope\nwas where her heart was, and her heart winding and turning with the wind, that\nmight wind her heart of gold to her, or else turn him from her. Hope and fear\nboth combatted in her, and both these are wakeful, which made her at break of\nday (what an old crone is the day, that is so long a breaking) to unloop her\nluket or casement, to look whence the blasts came, or what gait or pace the\nsea kept; when forthwith her eyes bred her eye-sore, the first white whereon\ntheir transpiercing arrows struck being the breathless corps of Leander: with\nthe sudden contemplation of this piteous spectacle of her love, sodden to\nhaddock’s meat, her sorrow could not choose but be indefinite, if her delight\nin him were but indifferent; and there is no woman but delights in sorrow, or\nshe would not use it so lightly for everything.\n\nDown she ran in her loose night-gown, and her hair about her ears (even as\nSemiramis ran out with her lie-pot in her hand, and her black dangling tresses\nabout her shoulders with her ivory comb ensnarled in them, when she heard that\nBabylon was taken) and thought to have kissed his dead corpse alive again, but\nas on his blue jellied sturgeon lips she was about to clap one of those warm\nplaisters, boistrous wool packs of ridged tides came rolling in, and raught\nhim from her (with a mind belike to carry him back to Abydos). At that she\nbecame a frantic Bacchanal outright, and made no more bones but sprang after\nhim, and so resigned up her priesthood, and left work for Musaeus and Kit\nMarlowe.\n\nJust how much the circumstances affected not only the structure of music but\nof language and music, appears in John Hollander’s discussion of the\nElizabethan theatres (_The Untuning of the Sky_ , [p.\n147](ch02a.html#page_147)) with their elaborate use of music in signalling\nfunctions and the necessity of incorporating all music except these signals\ninto the plot of the play itself. “The small coterie theaters of the city …\nfollowed the masque …”\n\n### **The printing press was at first mistaken for an engine of immortality by\neverybody except Shakespeare.**\n\nThe physical factors as restructuring the modes and areas of expression have\nso far occupied us only with regard to the sudden emergence of individual\nvoices and the seizing of the vernacular as a unified and ready-made public\naddress system. Simultaneously there occurred the realization that the printed\nword in the vernacular could confer an artificial eternity of fame. In a\ndelightful essay on Cardano (1501–1576) in _Abinger Harvest_ ([p.\n190](ch02a.html#page_190)) E. M. Forster points out that: “The printing press,\nthen only a century old, had been mistaken for an engine of immortality, and\nmen hastened to commit to it deeds and passions for the benefit of future\nages.” And Forster ([p. 193](ch02a.html#page_193)) quotes Cardano:\n\nIt has been my peculiar fortune to live in the century which discovered the\nwhole world – America, Brazil, Patagonia, Peru, Quito, Florida, New France,\nNew Spain, countries to the North and East and South. And what is more\nmarvellous than the human thunderbolt, which in its power far exceeds the\nheavenly? Nor will I be silent about thee, magnificent Magnet, who dost guide\nus through vast oceans, and night and storms, into countries we have never\nknown. Then there is our printing press, conceived by man’s genius, fashioned\nby his hands, yet a miracle equal to the divine.\n\nAbout the same time Pierre Boaistuau wrote in his _Theatrum Mundi_\n:[71](ch02b_fn62.html#ch02b_fn62fn71)\n\nI can find nothing that may be equall or compare to the wonderfull invention,\nutility and dignitie of printing, the which surmounteth all that the\nantiquitie may conceive or imagine of excellencie, knowing that it conserveth\nand keepeth all the conceptions of our soules, it is the treasure that doth\nimmortalize the monument of our spirits, and eternizeth world without end and\nalso bringeth to light the fruits of our labours. And although somewhat may be\nadded to all other acts and humane inventions, yet this alone has entred with\nsuch good hap and perfection in this world, that ther cannot be added nor\ndiminished any thing that doth not render it defectious and deformed: these\neffects are so mervailous, and executed with such celerity and diligence, that\none man alone in one day will print more letters, than the promptest scribe or\nscrivener may write with pen in the space of one whole year.\n\nSelf-expression is yet unknown as a concept; but “bringeth to light the fruits\nof our labours” is an excellent indication of the matrix from which the\nconcept will be extracted much later. “Doth immortalize the monument of our\nspirits” renders perfectly the sixteenth-century idea of an immortality won\nthrough toil and mechanical repetition of that toil. In our own century the\nidea of such immortality has taken on a wry quality that is caught by Joyce in\n_Ulysses_ ([p. 41](ch02.html#page_41)):\n\n“When one reads these strange pages of one long gone, one feels that one is at\none with one who once …\n\nThe grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a damp\ncrackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles\nbeats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. Unwholesome sandflats waited\nto suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath. He coasted them,\nwalking warily. A porter bottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey\nsand dough. A sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst.\n\nFrom meditation on books and libraries, that is, Stephen Dedalus turns to the\nmessage in the bottle, reaching it through a riot of audile-tactile-olfactory\nexperience carefully counterpointed with the subjective vistas of authors,\nlibraries, and literary immortality.\n\nThe theme of eternizing by means of the printed word had great plausibility in\nthe early period of typography when so many forgotten and unknown writers of\nthe past ages were being brought into a new and far more intense life, by\ntypography, than they had ever known in their actual scribal existences.\nShakespeare’s inscribed sonnets in 1609 were “To the onlie begetter … all\nhappinesses and that eternitie promised by our ever-living Poet, wisheth the\nwell-wishing adventurer in setting forth.”\n\nThe ever-living poet lives ever in print, that is, and promises that eternity\nof the printed word (ever so much more assured than the manuscript eternity of\na message in a bottle) to “the onlie begetter.” It is only proper that the\nidentity of the begetter should be as mysterious as the poetic process by\nwhich the sonnets were created. Since, however, eternity is now assured for\nthe begetter as he sets forth on a new life of printed poetic existence, the\npoet wishes him well, even as he is wishing himself well, in his printed\nvoyage through eternity. And so follows the setting forth of (and in) the text\nof the sonnets, just ten years after the Elizabethan sonnet vogue had passed.\n\nMore double talk was seldom put in thirty-odd words than in these words of\ndedication. Similar irony occurs in a preface to Shakespeare’s _Troilus and\nCressida_ , which appeared in front of the quarto text of 1609, the same year\nas the sonnets. It does not concern us here whether Shakespeare wrote this\npreface. It is too witty for Dekker, too restrained for Nashe. It is much on\nour theme of print as an engine of immortality:\n\nA never writer, to an ever reader, Newes. Eternall reader, you have heere a\nnew play, never estal’d with the Stage, never clapper-clawd with the palmes of\nthe vulgar, and yet passing full of the palme comicall; for it is a birth of\nyour braine, that never under-tooke anything commicall, vainlly: And were but\nthe vaine names of commedies changde for the titles of Commodities, or of\nPlayes for Pleas; you should see all those grand censors, that now stile them\nsuch vanities, flock to them for the maine grace of their gravities:\nespecially this authors Commedies, that are so fram’d to the life, that they\nserve for the most common Commentaries, of all the actions of our lives,\nshewing such a dexteritie, and power of witte, that the most displeased with\nPlayes, are pleasd with his Commedies. And all such dull and heavy-witted\nworldings, as were never capable of the witte of a Commedie, comming by report\nof them to his representations have found that witte there, that they never\nfound in them-selves, and have parted better wittied then they came: feeling\nan edge of witte set upon them, more then ever they dreamd they had braine to\ngrinde it on. So much and such savored salt of witte is in his Commedies, that\nthey may seeme (for their height of pleasure) to be borne in that sea that\nbrought forth Venus. Amongst all there is none more witty then this: And had I\ntime I would comment upon it, though I know it needs not, (for so much as will\nmake you thinke your testerne well bestowed) but for so much worth, as even\npoore I know to be stuft in it. It deserves such a labour, as well as the best\nCommedy in Terrence or Plautus. And believe this, that when hee is gone, and\nhis Commedies out of sale, you will scramble for them, and set up a new\nEnglish Inquisition. Take this for a warning, and at the perrill of your\npleasures losse, and Judgements, refuse not, nor like this the lesse, for not\nbeing sullied, with the smoaky breath of the multitude; but thanke fortune for\nthe scape it hath made amongst you. Since by the grand possessors wills I\nbeleeve you should have prayd for them rather than beene prayd. And so I leave\nall such to bee prayd for (for the states of their wits healths) that will not\npraise it. Vale.\n\nThis piece of prose requires the same kind of agility of attention as _Troilus\nand Cressida_ itself. It opens like James Joyce in the role of “Mr. Germ’s\nChoice” saying “My consumers are they not my producers?” The play’s never\nhaving been “clapper-clawd with the palmes of the vulgar” may indicate an Inns\nof Court performance. But the preface in its entirety is as much an analysis\nof communication theory as the play itself. At the hub of the play (III, iii)\nthe theme of the preface is stated at much greater length, beginning:\n\nA strange fellow here\n\nWrites me, that man – how dearly ever parted,  \nHow much in having, or without or in –  \nCannot make boast to have that which he hath,  \nNor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;\n\nThe preface uses this idea that the producer is only his consumer to mock both\nreaders and writers of the new age in a dazzling sequence of negative\ninvolutions. The author is as little impressed by the ultimate value of print\nas the Shakespeare who could not be bothered to print his plays.\n\nThere is no need to do more than mention many of the most popular of\nShakespeare’s sonnets as bodying forth the accepted ideas of his age on the\nsubject of eternity _via_ the printed vernacular word, as in sonnet LV, which\nopens:\n\nNot marble nor the gilded monuments  \nOf princes shall outlive this pow’rful rhyme;\n\nAnd because it has lived these centuries we suppose that the authors had no\ndoubts either. But the learned of the age, whatever their attitude to print,\nhad doubts concerning the staying powers of the vernaculars. And some of their\ndoubts appear in Spenser’s sonnet (_Amoretti_ , LXXV):\n\nOne day I wrote her name upon the strand,\n\nBut came the waves and washed it away:\n\nAgayne I wrote it with a second hand,\n\nBut came the tyde and made my paynes his prey.\n\nVayne man, sayd she, that doest in vaine assay\n\nA mortall thing so to immortalize: …\n\n“We must remember,” writes J. W. Lever in _The Elizabethan Love Sonnet_ ([p.\n57](ch02.html#page_57)) “to what extent life itself is patterned on literary\nmodes: how men in one age tend to conduct their amours in all earnestness,\nlike the heroes of Stendhal; in another in all flippancy, like the heroes of\nNoël Coward.” But whereas the Elizabethan was, like the Chaucerian “I,” able\nto shift into a variety of public and private roles, so he was able to play\nwith language on various levels. The old oral bond with its flexibility of\npitch held between reader and writer. Lever in explaining the nineteenth-\ncentury failure to grasp Sidney’s procedure comments ([p.\n57](ch02.html#page_57)) “It was the atrophy of positive convention during the\nnineteenth century, and the consequent splitting of the individual into a\npublic and a private self, that explains why so much personal verse of the\nVictorians evokes a sense of embarrassment.”\n\nS. L. Bethell’s _Shakespeare and the Popular Dramatic Tradition_ takes up this\ntheme thoroughly, showing how the break-up of the older bonds between author\nand public led nineteenth-century critics “to treat Shakespeare as Ibsen is\nmore appropriately treated: they fastened upon his characters as if they were\nhistorical personages, examining their psychology. … There was no attempt to\nconsider the historical anomaly by which a naturalistic drama could so quickly\nhave arisen out of a conventional tradition.” ([pp. 13](ch02.html#page_13)–14)\nIn the same way Hollywood could rise quickly because it built on the\nnineteenth century novel.\n\n### **The portability of the book, like that of the easel-painting, added much\nto the new cult of individualism.**\n\nVery arbitrarily we shall move on to a physical aspect of the printed book\nthat contributed a great deal to individualism. I mean its portability. As\neasel painting deinstitutionalized pictures, so printing broke library\nmonopoly. Moses Hadas mentions in _Ancilla to Classical Reading_ ([p.\n7](ch01.html#page_7)) that: “Papyrus made into rolls continued to be the\nregular material for books until the introduction, mainly by Christians for\nthe convenience of having the Gospels in a single volume, of the codex form\nand hence of vellum which is more suitable to that form.” He adds:\n\nthe codex, which is in effect the modern book, consisting of leaves arranged\nin quires, is obviously more compact than a roll. … could be reduced to the\nconvenient size of a pocket edition, and that advantage is usually taken to\nexplain the general adoption of the codex form by Christians in the fourth\ncentury … but through the third century the great majority of pagan remains\nare in rolls, while the great majority of Christian works are in codex form.\nThe usual size of the codex was about 10 by 7 inches.\n\nAs Febvre and Martin report in _L’Apparition du livre_ ([p.\n126](ch02a.html#page_126)), pocket-size books of devotion and books of hours\nwere perhaps the most numerous among all the books printed in the first\ncentury and more of typography: “Moreover, thanks to printing and the\nmultiplication of texts, the book ceased to seem a precious object to be\nconsulted in a library: there was more and more need to be able to carry it\nabout readily in order to refer to it or to read it anywhere at any time.”\n\nThis very natural inclination towards accessibility and portability went hand\nin hand with greatly increased reading speeds which were possible with uniform\nand repeatable type, but not at all with manuscript. The same drive towards\naccessibility and portability created ever larger publics and markets which\nwere indispensable to the whole Gutenberg undertaking. Febvre and Martin make\nclear ([p. 162](ch02a.html#page_162)) that: “From the first, printing emerged\nas an industry regulated by the same laws as any other, and the book as a\nproduct concocted by men who had their living to make – even when, as with the\nAldus family or the Eastiennes, they were at the same time humanists and\nscholars.”\n\nThese authors, then, proceed to go into the question of the considerable\ncapital needed for printing and publishing, the very high incidence of\ncommercial failure, and the drive for sales and markets. Even to the sixteenth\ncentury eye there was a notable trend of book selection and circulation that\nboded “l’apparition d’une civilisation de masse et de standardisation.” A new\nkind of consumer world was organized gradually. Out of the entire production\nof books till 1500, amounting to fifteen to twenty million copies of 30,000 to\n35,000 separate publications, by far the greatest proportion, seventy-seven\nper cent, are in Latin. But just as the printed book had routed the manuscript\nbetween 1500 and 1510, so the vernacular was soon to supersede Latin. For it\nwas inevitable that a larger market existed for the printed book within the\nbounds of a national speech than the international, clerical élite of Latin\nreaders could ever muster. Book production was a heavy capital venture and\nneeded the utmost markets to survive. Febvre and Martin write (p. 479): “Thus\nthe sixteenth century, era of the renewal of ancient culture, was the time\nwhen Latin began to lose ground. From 1530 certainly this trend is clear. The\nreading public … becomes therefore more and more a lay public – often of women\nand the middle class among whom many were not familiar with Latin.”\n\nThe problem of “what the public wants” is central to printing from the first.\nBut just as book format long retained the characteristics of manuscript\nappearance, so bookselling long depended on the medieval fair as an outlet.\n“The trade in books throughout the Middle Ages, it need scarcely be stressed,\nwas largely a second-hand business; only with the invention of printing did a\nnew-book market become a commonplace.”[72](ch02b_fn63.html#ch02b_fn63fn72) The\nmeaning of the medieval book trade as a second-hand operation can only be\ngrasped in our time through the parallel that the market in great paintings is\nlargely a second-hand market. For, in general, paintings and antiques are in\nthe category of the manuscript book before printing. For the printed book\nretaining a manuscript format, this was necessary if only for sales, since\nreaders were trained and disposed to the manuscript mode. Buhler has\nfascinating details ([p. 16](ch02.html#page_16)) about the early habit of\nsending printed books to the scribe to be copied, so that the student of the\nearliest printing would be well advised if he viewed the new invention, as the\nfirst printers did, as simply another form of writing.\n\n### **The uniformity and repeatability of print created the POLITICAL\nARITHMETIC of the seventeenth century and the HEDONISTIC CALCULUS of the\neighteenth.**\n\nNevertheless, there was an inherent principle of uniformity in print just as\nthere was the tendency for a manuscript book to become “a leisurely\naccumulation of heterogeneous texts.” The principle of uniformity and\nrepeatability was to find ever fuller expression as print raised visual\nquantification to eminence. By the seventeenth century we find ourselves in a\nworld that speaks of “political arithemetic,” which carries the separation of\nfunctions a step past Machiavelli. If Machiavelli could argue in the early\nsixteenth century that “there is one rule for business and another for private\nlife,”[73](ch02b_fn64.html#ch02b_fn64fn73) he was really recording the effect\nand meaning of the printed word in separating writer and reader, producer and\nconsumer, ruler and ruled, into sharply defined categories. Before printing\nthese operations were much interfused in the same way as the scribe as\nproducer was involved in reading, and the student was involved in the making\nof the books he studied.\n\nIt cannot be easily grasped, else it had been explained long ago, that the\nmechanical principle of visual uniformity and repeatability which is inherent\nin the press steadily extended itself to include many kinds of organization.\nMalynes wrote in his _Lex Mercatoria_ (1622): “We see how one thing driveth or\nenforceth another, like as in a clock where there are many wheels, the first\nwheel being stirred driveth the next and that the third and so forth, till the\nlast that moveth the instrument that striketh the clock; or like as in a press\ngoing in a strait, where the foremost is driven by him that is next to him,\nand the next by him that followeth him.”[74](ch02b_fn64.html#ch02b_fn64fn74)\n\nMore than two hundred years before Thomas Huxley’s idea of the educated mind\nas a “clear cold logic engine with all its parts of equal strength” we\nencounter the principle of movable types and replaceable parts extended to\nsocial organization. But let us note that it is a meaningless principle where\nthe uniform processing of minds by the habit of reading the printed word has\nnot occurred. In a word, individualism, whether in the passive atomistic sense\nof drilled uniformed soldiery or in the active aggressive sense of private\ninitiative and self-expression, alike assumes a prior technology of\nhomogeneous citizens. This scabrous paradox has haunted literate men in every\nage. In the later nineteenth century it expressed itself in the emancipation\nof women which was accomplished by assigning men and women to the same jobs.\nIt was thereby hoped they would be free. But this mechanical operation of the\nhuman spirit was also felt and furiously resisted in the first age of print.\n“One might almost say,” writes Leo Lowenthal in _Literature and the Image of\nMan_ ([p. 41](ch02.html#page_41)), “that the prevailing philosophy of human\nnature since the Renaissance has been based on the conception of each\nindividual as a “deviant case whose existence consists very largely in his\nefforts to assert his personality against the restrictive and levelling claims\nof society.”\n\nBefore considering the evidence from the world of Cervantes offered by\nLowenthal, here are two peripheral items that also bear on these issues.\nWriting of Oxford University in the sixteenth century, C. E. Mallet opens his\nsecond volume of his _History of the University of Oxford_ :\n\nThe year 1485 marks an epoch in history at Oxford as elsewhere. Under the\nTudors the mediaeval university passed imperceptibly away. The old customs\nlost to some extent their meaning. The old views of education altered. The old\nlawless democratic spirit yielded unwillingly to discipline. The Renaissance\nset up new ideals of learning. The Reformation brought new energies to\ntheological debate. The old Halls were fast disappearing. The Colleges, some\nof which had begun life as struggling little communities of theologians or\nArts-students, grew into larger and wealthier societies, with a fuller share\nin the government of the place. Undergraduate Commoners, as we know them, came\nmore definitely into view. Several Colleges had from the beginning elected\nundergraduates as Fellows, and in some cases young students had been admitted\non a special footing. Merton had its _parvuli_. Queen’s had its Poor Boys.\nMagdalen had some very young Demies. Poor Colleges had eked out their revenues\nby admitting boarders. Waynflete had sanctioned a system of Gentlemen\nCommoners, which Wykehan had been unwilling to permit. But it was not till the\nsixteenth century, when the Colleges became recognized centres of teaching,\nwhen the lectures in Schools Street were going out of fashion, when the\ntraining of priests was gradually ceasing to be the chief aim of Oxford\neducation, and when, after the perils of the Reformation, the expansion of\nOxford on new lines began, that the great class of undergraduate Commoners,\nwith no direct share in College endowments, arose to take the College courts\nand gardens for their own.\n\nThe “old lawless democratic spirit” has reference to the decentralist, oral\norganization of society that preceded print and nationalism. Centralism of the\nnewly released national energies required greatly increased interdependence.\nHere the printed text books made themselves felt very soon. And just as\npapyrus made the Roman road, print made for the speed and visual precision\nfelt in the new monarchies of the Renaissance. It is fascinating to move ahead\na century and to Cambridge to observe the strong centralist action of the\nprinted book. Christopher Wordsworth tells the story of the strange reversals\nand interplay of the written and the oral modes in his _Scholae academicae:\nSome Account of the Studies at the English Universities in the Eighteenth\nCentury_ ([p. 16](ch02.html#page_16));\n\nBefore entering upon the details of the university exercises and examinations,\nwe ought to try to divest ourselves of a modern opinion, that study exists for\nexaminations rather than examinations for study. Indeed, to apply the measure\nof their prevalence and efficiency to the education of past generations, would\nbe to commit an anachronism.\n\nWe might look in vain for any public examination to justify the learning and\nresearch which in the seventeenth century made English students famous; –\nwhose efforts were fostered, rather by the encouragement of tutors and\nfriends, than by the disputations in the schools. Examinations in our modern\nacceptation there were none. As books became cheaper, the quicker and the more\ndiligent students discovered that they could acquire knowledge for themselves\nwhere previous generations had been dependent on the oral teaching. Then arose\nthe necessity of examination, and as this has come to be more scientifically\nconducted, and its results to be more public, and at last in a sense\nmarketable, there has been a fresh demand for oral instruction.\n\nWordsworth is describing the rise of centralist examining which arose from\naccess to decentralized learning. For it was easy under print conditions for a\nstudent to read in areas unvisited by his examiners. But the principle that\nthe portable, uniform book creates the centralized uniform exam (in place of\nthe older oral test) is one that applies at all levels. The printed word, we\nshall see, has quite strange organizational effects on the vernacular. And the\neighteenth century business man whose political arithmetic was based on visual\nquantity, or the eighteenth century business man whose speculations were built\non the mechanism of “the hedonistic calculus,” alike relate to the uniform\nrepeatability of print technology. Yet the calculating business man who used\nthis principle at every turn, in production and distribution, fought its logic\nof centralism with anarchic bitterness. So Lowenthal observes in _Literature\nand the Image of Man_ ([pp. 41](ch02.html#page_41)–2):\n\nVery quickly after the downfall of feudalism, the literary artist developed a\nliking for figures who look at society not from the viewpoint of a participant\nbut from the vantage point of an outsider. The further these figures are\nremoved from the affairs of society, the greater is likely to be their social\nfailure (which is almost, but not quite, a tautology); they are also more\nprone, as a result, to display unspoiled, uninhibited, and highly individual\ncharacteristics. The conditions – whatever they may be – that remove them from\nthe affairs of society are viewed as the conditions that bring them closer to\ntheir inner natures. The more primitive and “natural” the setting into which\nthey are cast, the better are they able to develop and maintain their\nhumaneness.\n\nCervantes presents an array of such marginal figures and situations. There\nare, first, the mad people – Don Quixote and the Man of Glass – who though\nstill operating in the social world are in continuous conflict with it by word\nand deed. Then in _Rinconete and Cortadillo_ , we meet petty crooks and\nbeggars who live parasitically off the social world. One step farther from the\ncenter we find the gypsies presented in _The Little Gypsy_ (_La Gitana_); they\nare completely outside the main stream of affairs. Finally, we have the\nsituation wherein Don Quixote, the marginal Knight, speaks to the simple\ngoatherds about the Golden Age in which the unity of man and nature reaches\nits fulfillment.\n\nTo this catalog of marginal types and situations, we add the figure of woman,\nwho almost throughout the entire course of modern literature from Cervantes to\nIbsen has been treated as an individual closer to her own nature and truth\nthan are men, since man is indissolubly bound up with the competitive\nprocesses of work, in contrast to the enforced removal of woman from\nprofessional activities. Not accidentally does Cervantes use Dulcinea as a\nsymbol of human creativity.\n\n### **The typographic logic created**THE OUTSIDER** , the alienated man, as\nthe type of integral, that is, intuitive and **IRRATIONAL** , man.**\n\nIf Lowenthal is right, we have spent much energy and fury in recent centuries\nin destroying oral culture by print technology so that the uniformly processed\nindividuals of commercial society can return to oral marginal spots as\ntourists and consumers, whether geographical or artistic. The eighteenth\ncentury began to spend its time at the Metropolitan Opera as it were. Having\nrefined and homogenized and visualised itself to the point of self-alienation,\nit hied off to the Hebrides, the Indies, the Americas, the transcendental\nimagination, and especially to childhood, in search of natural man. D. H.\nLawrence and others repeated this Odyssey in our day with much acclaim. It is\na performance of automatic kind. Art tends to become a mere compensation for a\ntop-sided life.\n\nLowenthal gives an excellent account of the new alienated man who refused to\njoin the consumer rush and remained on the old feudal and oral margins of\nsociety. To the new crowd of visually and consumer-oriented society these\nmarginal figures have great appeal.\n\n“The figure of woman” joins this picturesque group of outsiders. Her haptic\nbias, her intuition, her wholeness entitle her to marginal status as a\nRomantic figure. Byron understood that men must be homogenized, splintered,\nspecialists. But not women:\n\nMan’s love is of man’s life a thing apart,  \n’Tis woman’s whole existence.\n\n“Woman,” wrote Meredith in 1859, “is the last thing to be civilized by man.”\nBy 1929 she had been homogenized by means of the movies and photo advertizing.\nMere print had not been intense enough to reduce her to uniformity and\nrepeatability and specialism.\n\nWhat a fate, to be integral and whole in a fragmented and visual flatland! But\nthe homogenization of women was finally effected in the twentieth century\nafter the perfection of photo-engraving permitted them to pursue the same\ncourses of visual uniformity and repeatability that print had brought to men.\nI have devoted an entire volume, _The Mechanical Bride_ , to this theme.\n\nPictorial advertisements and movies finally did for women what print\ntechnology had done for men centuries before. When raising these themes, one\nis beset by queries of the “Was it a good thing?” variety. Such questions seem\nto mean: “How should we _feel_ about these matters?” They never suggest that\nanything could be done about them. Surely, understanding the formal dynamic or\nconfiguration of such events is the prime concern. That is really doing\nsomething. Control and action in terms of values must follow understanding.\nValue judgments have long been allowed to create a moral fog around\ntechnological change such as renders understanding impossible.\n\nBut how were people prevented during these centuries from understanding what\nthey were doing to themselves by means of visual quantification and\nfragmentation? Boasts on all hands of the segmental analysis of every function\nand operation of person and society, and wild laments that this splintering is\nalso affecting the inner life! The split man enters the scene as Mr. Entirely\nNormal. He is still here in that capacity, though increasingly in a panic\nabout electric media, as he might well be. For the marginal man is a centre-\nwithout-a-margin, an integral independent type. That is, he is feudal,\n“aristocratic,” and oral. The new urban or bourgeois man is centre-margin\noriented. That is, he is visual, concerned about appearances and conformity or\nrespectability. As he becomes individual or uniform, he becomes homogeneous.\nHe belongs. And he creates and craves large centralist groupings, starting\nwith nationalism.\n\n### **Cervantes confronted typographic man in the figure of Don Quixote.**\n\nThere is no need to go into Cervantes’ novel in detail, since it is well\nknown. But Cervantes, in his life and in his work, presents the case of the\nfeudal man confronted with a newly visually quantified and homogeneous world.\nIn Lowenthal’s _Literature and the Image of Man_ ([p. 21](ch02.html#page_21))\nwe read how\n\nFundamentally the themes of his novel are those of an old way of life being\nreplaced by a new order. Cervantes stresses the resulting conflicts in two\nways: through the struggles of the Knight, and through the contrast between\nhim and Sancho Panza. Don Quixote lives in a phantasy world of the vanishing\nfeudal hierarchy; the people with whom he deals, however, are merchants, minor\nfunctionaries in the government, unimportant intellectuals – in short, they\nare, like Sancho, people who want to get ahead in the world and, therefore,\ndirect their energies to the things which will bring them profit.\n\nIn choosing the great folios of medieval romances as his _reality_ , Cervantes\nestablishes an ambivalence of the utmost use. For print was the _new_ reality\nand it was print that made the old reality of the Middle Ages popularly\navailable for the first time. Thus, in our day, movie and TV have given a\ndimension and reality to the American frontier in all our lives, such as it\nhad for very few people in historical fact. Next to the Books of Hours,\nmedieval romances were by far the biggest item on the market. And whereas the\nBooks of Hours were preferred in pocket editions, the romances came in\nfolio.[75](ch02b_fn65.html#ch02b_fn65fn75)\n\nLowenthal ([p. 22](ch02.html#page_22)) makes some further observations about\nDon Quixote that are especially relevant here for the understanding of print\nculture:\n\nOne might say that Don Quixote is the first figure in Renaissance literature\nwho seeks by action to bring the world into harmony with his own plans and\nideals. Cervantes’ irony lies in the fact that while overtly his hero battles\nagainst the new (the early manifestations of middle-class life) in the name of\nthe old (the feudal system), actually he attempts to sanction a new principle.\nThis principle consists, basically, in the autonomy of individual thinking and\nfeeling. The dynamics of society have come to demand a continuous and active\ntransformation of reality; the world must be perpetually constructed anew. Don\nQuixote recreates his world even though he does so in a phantastic and\nsolipsistic fashion. The honor for which he enters the lists is the product of\nhis thinking, not of socially established and accepted values. He defends\nthose whom he considers worthy of his protection and assails those he believes\nto be wicked. In this sense he is a rationalist as well as an idealist.\n\nEnough has been said earlier apropos of the drive towards applied knowledge\ninherent in print technology to give additional significance to Lowenthal’s\nwords. This is the situation which David Riesman highlights in _The Lonely\nCrowd_ as the pattern of “inner direction.” Inner direction towards remote\ngoals is inseparable from print culture and the perspective and vanishing\npoint organization of space that are part of it. The fact that no such\norganization of space or culture is compatible with electronic simultaneity is\nwhat has involved Western man in new anxiety for a century. In addition to the\nsolipsism and solitude and uniformity of print culture, there is now the\nimmediate electric pressure for its dissolution.\n\nIn a study of _The Vanishing Adolescent_ ([p. 25](ch02.html#page_25)) Edgar Z.\nFriedenberg casts the adolescent in the role of Don Quixote:\n\nThe process of becoming an American, as it goes on in high school, tends to be\na process of renunciation of differences. This conflicts directly, of course,\nwith the adolescent need for self-definition; but the conflict is so masked in\ninstitutionalized gaiety that the adolescent himself usually does not become\naware of it. He must still deal with the alienation it engenders. He may do\nthis by marginal differentiation, like Riesman’s glad-handing boy with the\nspecial greeting style. He may do it by erupting into bouts of occasionally\nviolent silliness, which does not make him seem queer to other people because\nit is unconsciously recognized as a form of self-abnegation rather than self-\nassertion, and is not, therefore, threatening. He may, if he has sufficient\nego-strength, become the adolescent equivalent of a genuine revolutionary –\nrather than a rebel – that is, he may actually succeed in rejecting the\nfolkways of the school without identifying with them and becoming guilty and\nraucous; …\n\nThe school system, custodian of print culture, has no place for the rugged\nindividual. It is, indeed, the homogenizing hopper into which we toss our\nintegral tots for processing. Some of the most memorable poems of our language\nconcern Wordsworth’s Lucy, on the one hand, and Yeats _Among School-children_\n, on the other. Both of these are much concerned with the poignant conflict\nbetween the order of enclosed and uniform systems and the spontaneity of the\nworld of spirit. The inherent conflict that Friedenberg defines so well is at\nthe centre of print technology itself, which isolates the individual yet also\ncreates massive groupings by means of vernacular nationalism. Friedenberg is\nspeaking of a situation inherent in movable types from the first when he says\n([p. 54](ch02.html#page_54)):\n\nWe conceive our country as having achieved a position of leadership and\ndominance by carefully subordinating personal and ethnic disparity to the\ninterests of teamwork in a colossal technical and administrative enterprise.\nFor us, a personal conformity is a moral mandate. When we insist on taking a\npersonal stand and bucking the system, we feel not only anxious but guilty as\nwell.\n\nDonne’s mention of his “hydroptic immoderate thirst for humane learning and\nlanguages” beset countless men in the sixteenth century. There was a furious\nconsumer urge in that first age of mass production such as struck the United\nStates in the 1920’s with the movies and radio. The same consumer urge is only\nnow reaching Europe and England after the Second World War. It is a phenomenon\nthat goes with high-intensity visual stress and organization of experience.\n\n### **Typographic man can express but is helpless to read the configurations\nof print technology.**\n\nThe subject of nationalism and print has been held back until now lest it\nusurp the entire book. It will be the easier to handle the complex of issues\nnow that we have encountered similar groupings of issues in quite different\nareas of experience. The present volume to this point might be regarded as a\ngloss on a single text of Harold Innis: “The effect of the discovery of\nprinting was evident in the savage religious wars of the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries. Application of power to communication industries\nhastened the consolidation of vernaculars, the rise of nationalism,\nrevolution, and new outbreaks of savagery in the twentieth\ncentury.”[76](ch02b_fn66.html#ch02b_fn66fn76)\n\nInnis in his later work tackled configurations rather than sequences of events\nin their interplay. In his earlier work, like _The Fur Trade in Canada_ , he\nhad been a conventional arranger of evidence in perspective packages of inert,\nstatic components. As he began to understand the structuring powers of media\nto impose their assumptions subliminally, he strove to record the interaction\nof media and cultures: “Improvements in communication, like the Irish bull of\nthe bridge which separated the two countries, make for increased difficulties\nof understanding. The cable compelled contraction of language and facilitated\na rapid widening between the English and American languages. In the vast realm\nof fiction in the Anglo-Saxon world, the influence of the newspaper … the\ncinema and the radio has been evident in the best seller and the creation of\nspecial classes of readers with little prospect of communication between\nthem.”[77](ch02b_fn67.html#ch02b_fn67fn77) Innis is here speaking with ease of\nthe interplay among literary and non-literary forms exactly as in the earlier\nquotation he was speaking of the interplay between the mechanization of the\nvernaculars and the rise of military, nationalist states.\n\nThere is nothing wilful or arbitrary about the Innis mode of expression. Were\nit to be translated into perspective prose, it would not only require huge\nspace, but the insight into the modes of interplay among forms of organization\nwould also be lost. Innis sacrificed point of view and prestige to his sense\nof the urgent need for insight. A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when\nsubstituted for insight and understanding. As Innis got more insights he\nabandoned any mere point of view in his presentation of knowledge. When he\ninterrelates the development of the steam press with “the consolidation of the\nvernaculars” and the rise of nationalism and revolution he is not reporting\nanybody’s point of view, least of all his own. He is setting up a mosaic\nconfiguration or galaxy for insight. It was a prime effect of print in\naltering human sense ratios, that it substituted static point of view for\ninsight into causal dynamics. We shall consider this further on. But Innis\nmakes no effort to “spell out” the interrelations between the components in\nhis galaxy. He offers no consumer packages in his later work, but only do-it-\nyourself kits, like a symbolist poet or an abstract painter. _Literature and\nthe Press_ by Louis Dudek provides a straight-away perspective picture of the\nrise of the steam press, but the effects on language, on war, and on the\nemergence of new literary forms are not mentioned since they would require a\nnon-literary or mythic form in order to be explained at all.\n\nJames Joyce devised an entirely new form of expression in _Finnegans Wake_ in\norder to capture the complex interplay of factors in the very configuration\nthat we are considering here. In the following passage “fowl” includes _La\nPatrie_ , the Great Mother, and “foule” or mob created by the homogenizing\npowers of print. When, therefore, it is mentioned that “man will become\ndirigible,” the way in which this happens is simply an inflation by accretion\nof homogeneous units.\n\nLead, kindly fowl! They always did: ask the ages. What bird has done yesterday\nman may do next year, be it fly, be it moult, be it hatch, be it agreement in\nthe nest. For her socioscientific sense is sound as a bell, sir, her volucrine\nautomutativeness right on normalcy: she knows, she just feels she was kind of\nborn to lay and love eggs (trust her to propagate the species and hoosh her\nfluffballs safe through din and danger!); lastly but mostly, in her genesic\nfield it is all game and no gammon, she is ladylike in everything she does and\nplays the gentleman’s part every time. Let us auspice it! Yes, before all this\nhas time to end the golden age must return with its vengeance. Man will become\ndirigible, Ague will be rejuvenated, woman with her ridiculous white burden\nwill reach by one step sublime incubation, the manewanting human lioness with\nher dishorned discipular manram will lie down together publicly flank upon\nfleece. No, assuredly, they are not justified, those gloompourers who grouse\nthat letters have never been quite their old selves again since that weird\nweekday in bleak Janiveer (yet how palmy date in a waste’s oasis!) when to the\nshock of both, Biddy Doran looked ad literature. ([p.\n112](ch02.html#page_112))\n\nIt may well be that print and nationalism are axiological or co-ordinate,\nsimply because by print a people _sees_ itself for the first time. The\nvernacular in appearing in high visual definition affords a glimpse of social\nunity co-extensive with vernacular boundaries. And more people have\nexperienced this visual unity of their native tongues _via_ the newspaper than\nthrough the book. Carlton Hayes is most helpful in his _Historical Evolution\nof Modern Nationalism_ ([p. 293](ch02b.html#page_293)):\n\nNor is it at all certain that the “masses” in any country have been directly\nresponsible for the rise of modern nationalism. The movement appears to have\ngotten under way first among the “intellectual” classes and to have received\ndecisive impetus from the support of the middle classes. In England, where\nphysical environment and political and religious circumstances were peculiarly\nfavorable, a strong national consciousness developed considerable before the\neighteenth century, and it may be that English nationalism did spring more or\nless spontaneously out of mass feeling and sentiment. Even here, the matter is\ndebatable, though it is not within the scope of the present work to indicate\nthe pros and cons in any detail.\n\nOutside of England, however, there can be little question that in the first\nhalf of the eighteenth century the masses of Europe, as well as of Asia and\nAmerica, whilst possessing some consciousness of nationality, thought of\nthemselves chiefly as belonging to a province or town or an empire, rather\nthan to a national state, and made no serious or effective protest against\nbeing transferred from one political domain to another, and that their later\nthought and action as nationalities were taught them by the intellectual and\nmiddle classes of their respective countries.\n\n### **The historians, although aware that nationalism originated in the\nsixteenth century, have yet no explanation of this passion that preceded\ntheory.**\n\nIt is important nowadays to understand why there cannot be nationalism where\nthere has not first been an experience of a vernacular in printed form. Hayes\nhere indicates that in non-literate areas, ferment and social action of a\ntribal kind is not to be confused with nationalism. Hayes had no clue about\nthe rise of visual quantification in the later Middle Ages, nor of the visual\neffects of print on individualism and nationalism in the sixteenth century. He\nwas keenly aware ([p. 4](ch01.html#page_4)) that there was no nationalism in\nthe modern sense before the sixteenth century when the modern state system of\nEurope emerged:\n\nThe states which composed this new system were very different from the\n“nations” of primitive tribesmen. They were much larger and much looser. They\nwere more in the nature of agglomerations of peoples with diverse languages\nand dialects and with divergent traditions and institutions. In most of them a\nparticular people, a particular nationality, constituted the core and\nfurnished the governing class and the official language, and in all of them\nminority as well as majority nationalities usually evinced a high degree of\nloyalty to a common monarch or “sovereign.” They were referred to, in\ncontradistinction to the older comprehensive Empire, as “nations” or “national\nstates,” and popular loyalty to their sovereigns has sometimes been described\nas “nationalism.” But it must rigidly be borne in mind that they were not\n“nations” in the primitive tribal sense and that their “nationalism” had other\nfoundation than that of present-day nationalism. The European “nations” of the\nsixteenth century were more akin to small empires than to large tribes.\n\nHayes is mystified by the peculiar character of modern internationalism which\nbegan with the primitivistic obsession of the eighteenth century: “Modern\nnationalism signifies a more or less purposeful effort to revive primitive\ntribalism on an enlarged and more artificial scale.” ([p.\n12](ch01.html#page_12)) But since the telegraph and radio, the globe has\ncontracted, spatially, into a single large village. Tribalism is our only\nresource since the electro-magnetic discovery.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville in his _L’Ancien Régime_ ([p. 156](ch02a.html#page_156))\nshows himself much more aware than Hayes of the causes and effects of\nnationalism. Not only had accustomation to print tended to create a uniform\ntype of citizen but the political education of France was carried on by men of\nletters:\n\nThe writers furnished not merely their ideas to the people who made it, but\nalso their temperament and disposition. As a result of their long education,\nin the absence of any other instructors, coupled with their profound ignorance\nof practice, all Frenchmen from reading their books finally contracted the\ninstincts, the turn of mind, the tastes and even the eccentricities natural to\nthose who write. To such an extent was this the case that, when finally they\nhad to act, they transported into politics all the habits of literature.\n\nA study of the history of our Revolution shows that it was conducted precisely\nin the same spirit, that has caused so many abstract books to be written on\ngovernment – the same attraction for general theories, complete systems of\nlegislation, and exact symmetry in the laws; the same contempt for existing\nfacts; the same confidence in theory, the same taste for the original, the\ningenious and the novel in institutions; the same desire to rebuild at once\nthe entire constitution according to the rules of logic and a single plan, in\nthe place of trying to amend it in its parts.\n\nThe mysterious “logic” mania of the French is easily recognizable as the\nvisual component in isolation from other factors. Similarly, visual\nquantification as a collective mania yields the French Revolutionary military\nmania. Here the uniform and the homogeneous are _most_ visibly at one. The\nmodern soldier is especially the instance of the movable type, the replaceable\npart, the classic Gutenberg phenomenon. De Tocqueville has much to say of this\nin his _European Revolution_ ([pp. 140](ch02a.html#page_140)–1):\n\nWhat the republican partisans took for love of the Republic was chiefly a love\nof the Revolution. In fact, the army was the only class in France in which\nevery member, without exception, had gained by the Revolution and had a\npersonal interest in supporting it. To it every officer owed his rank, and\nevery soldier his chance of becoming an officer. The army was, in truth, the\nstanding Revolution in arms. If it still fiercely exclaimed: “Long live the\nRepublic!” this was really a challenge to the old regime, whose friends cried:\n“Long live the King!” Deep down the army cared nothing for civic liberties.\nHatred of foreigners and a love of his native land are generally the only\nelements of the soldier’s patriotism even in free nations; still more must\nthis have been the case at that time in France. The army, like almost every\nother army in the world, could make nothing of the slow and complicated\ngyrations of a representative government; it detested and despised the\nAssembly, because it understood only powers that were strong and simple; all\nit wanted was national independence and victories.\n\n### **Nationalism insists on equal rights among individuals and among nations\nalike.**\n\nIf rigorous centralism is a main feature of literacy and print, no less so is\nthe eager assertion of individual rights. De Tocqueville notes in _The\nEuropean Revolution_ ([p. 103](ch02.html#page_103)): “In 1788 and 1789 all the\npamphlets published even those by the future revolutionaries themselves, are\nopposed to centralization and in favor of local rule.” He adds a little later\n([pp. 112](ch02.html#page_112)–13) a note that indicates that, like Harold\nInnis, he had the habit not of presenting a picture of events but of\nmeditating on their inner causes: “What is so extraordinary in the French\nRevolution is not so much the procedures it employed as the ideas it\nconceived. The new and astonishing thing is that so many nations should arrive\nat a stage where such procedures could be so efficiently employed and such\nideas so easily accepted.”\n\nAt this point it would be a joy to have a de Tocqueville to take over the\nwriting of _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ , for his mode of thought is the one that is\nhere followed so far as possible. He defines his method perfectly when\nspeaking of the old regime ([p. 136](ch02a.html#page_136)): “I myself have\ntried to judge it not from my own ideas but from the feelings which it\ninspired in those who endured and then destroyed it.”\n\nNationalism depends upon or derives from the “fixed point of view” that\narrives with print, perspective, and visual quantification. But a fixed point\nof view can be collective or individual or both, thus causing great diversity\nof clash and outlook. Hayes writes in his _Historical Evolution of Modern\nNationalism_ ([p. 135](ch02a.html#page_135)): “By 1815 liberal nationalism was\na fairly definite intellectual movement throughout western and central Europe.\n… It was surely not aristocratic, and, though paying lip-service to democracy,\nit tended to be middle-class.” It is his next sentences that indicate the\n“fixed point of view” for the state, on one hand, and the individual, on the\nother: “It stressed the absolute sovereignty of the national state, but sought\nto limit the implications of this principle by stressing individual liberties\n– political, economic, and religious – within each national state.”\n\nThe inevitable condition of fixed viewpoints arising from the visual stress in\nnationalism also led, writes Hayes ([p. 178](ch02a.html#page_178)), to the\nprinciple that: “Because the national state does not belong to the citizens of\nany particular generation, it must not be revolutionized.” This principle is\nmade especially manifest in the written-visual fixity of the American\nConstitution, whereas pre-print and pre-industrial forms of political order\nhave no such pattern.\n\nEarly in his book ([pp. 10](ch01.html#page_10)–11), Hayes points to the\nexcitement about the discovery of the “equal” principle as it applied both to\ngroups and individuals: equal rights of individuals to determine the state and\ngovernment to which they would belong, equal rights of individual nations to\nself-determination.\n\nIn practice, therefore, nationalism does not develop its full potential of\nuniform lateral extension until after the application of print technology to\nthe methods of work and production. Hayes can see the logic of this, but is\npuzzled to see how nationalism ever could have started in agrarian societies.\nHe is entirely without perception of the role of print technology in disposing\nmen to the uniform, repeatable patterns of association:\n\nThe putting forth of nationalist doctrines was one of the mental exercises of\nthe eighteenth century. Primarily it was the work of intellectuals and an\nexpression of current intellectual interests and tendencies. But what has\nchiefly enabled nationalist doctrines, once put forth, to take hold of the\nmasses of mankind since then, has been a marvellous improvement in the\nmechanical arts, an improvement which is nowadays termed the Industrial\nRevolution – the invention of labor-saving machinery, the perfecting of the\nsteam-engine and other motive devices, the extensive use of coal and iron, the\nmass production of commodities, and the speeding up of transportation and\ncommunication. This Industrial Revolution began in a large way in England\nabout a hundred and forty years ago – about the time of the Jacobin Revolution\nin France – and its intensification in England and its extension throughout\nthe world have paralleled the rise and spread of popular devotion to doctrines\nof nationalism. The doctrines themselves were originally crystallized in an\nagricultural society, before the advent of the new industrial machinery, but\ntheir acceptance has accompanied, and their complete triumph has followed, the\nintroduction of the new machinery and the transition from an agricultural to\nan industrial society. It seems to have been a perfectly natural development.\n([pp. 232](ch02b.html#page_232)–3)\n\nSince industrialism even the arts, philosophy, and religion have been\npatterned by nationalism. Hayes writes ([p. 289](ch02b.html#page_289)):\n\nFor a century and a half major improvements in technology, in the industrial\narts, and in material comfort, as well as most developments in the realms of\nintellect and aesthetics, have been yoked to the service of nationalism. The\nIndustrial Revolution, despite its cosmopolitan potentialities, has been\nlargely nationalized in actual fact. Modern scholarship, despite its\nscientific claims and its ubiquitous nature, has been preponderantly enlisted\nin support of nationalism. Philosophies which in origin were not expressly\nnationalist and were sometimes definitely intended to be anti-nationalist,\nphilosophies such as Christianity, Liberalism, Marxism, and the systems of\nHegel, Comte, and Nietzche, have been copiously drawn upon and frequently\ndistorted for nationalist purposes. The plastic arts, music, and belles-\nlettres, despite their universal appeal, have become increasingly the product\nor the pride of national patriots. So much is nationalism a commonplace in the\nmodes of thought and action of the civilized populations of the contemporary\nworld that most men take nationalism for granted. Without serious reflection\nthey imagine it to be the most natural thing in the universe and assume that\nit must always have existed.\n\nWhat has given such a vogue to nationalism in recent times? That is the first\nmajor question to be raised concerning this most vital phenomenon.\n\n### **The citizen\n\narmies of Cromwell and Napoleon were the ideal manifestations of the new\ntechnology.**\n\nAs an historian Hayes knows well ([p. 290](ch02b.html#page_290)) that there is\na mystery about nationalism. It never existed before the Renaissance, and it\nwas never originated as an idea: “But the philosophers of nationalism did not\nmake its vogue. The vogue was there when they appeared on the scene. They\nmerely expressed and gave some emphasis and guidance to it. For the historian\nthey are extremely useful in that they afford him vivid illustrations of\ncurrent tendencies in nationalist thought.” He ridicules the idea that “the\nmasses of mankind are instinctively nationalist,” or that nationalism is\nnatural at all: “During much the longest periods of recorded history the\ngroups to which individuals have been predominantly loyal have been tribes,\nclans, cities, provinces, manors, guilds, or polyglot empires. Yet it is\nnationalism, far more than any other expression of human gregariousness, which\nhas come to the fore in modern times.” ([p. 292](ch02b.html#page_292))\n\nThe answer to Hayes’ problem is in the efficacy of the printed word in first\nvisualizing the vernacular and then creating that homogeneous mode of\nassociation which permits modern industry, markets, and the visual enjoyment\nof national status. He writes ([p. 61](ch02.html#page_61)):\n\nThe “nation in arms” was one Jacobin concept of great significance for\nnationalist propaganda. The “nation in public schools” was another. Previous\nto the French Revolution, it had long and generally been held that children\nbelonged to their parents and that it was for parents to determine what\nschooling, if any, their children should have.\n\nLiberty, equality and fraternity found their most natural, if least\nimaginative, expression in the uniformity of the revolutionary citizen armies.\nThey were not only exact repetitions of the printed page, but of the assembly\nline. The English were much ahead of Europe in nationalism as in\nindustrialism, and in typographical organization of the army. Cromwell’s\nIronsides were in action a hundred and fifty years before the Jacobin armies.\n\nEngland preceded all countries on the Continent in the development of an acute\npopular consciousness of common nationality. Long before the French Revolution\nat a time when Frenchmen had thought of themselves primarily as Burgundians or\nGascons or Provencals, Englishmen had been Englishmen and had rallied with\nreal national patriotism to the secularizations of Henry VIII and the exploits\nof Elizabeth. There had been a nationalist spirit in the political philosophy\nof Milton and Locke hardly paralleled by their contemporaries on the\nContinent, and Bolingbroke, the Englishman, was a pioneer in the expounding of\na formal doctrine of nationalism. It was natural, therefore, that any\nEnglishman who would enter the lists against Jacobinism should be arrayed in\ntrappings of nationalism.\n\nSo writes Hayes on [page 86](ch02.html#page_86) of _Historical Evolution of\nModern Nationalism_. Similar testimony of English precedence in national unity\ncomes from a sixteenth century Venetian ambassador:\n\nIn 1557 the Venetian ambassador Giovanni Micheli wrote to his government: “In\nso far as religion [in England] is concerned, the example and authority of the\nsovereign are all-important. The English esteem and practise their religion\nonly in so far as thereby they fulfil their duty as subjects towards their\nruler; they live as he lives, believe what he believes: in one word, do\neverything he commands … they would accept Mohammedanism or Judaism if the\nking believed in it, and it was the king’s will that they should believe in\nit.” To a foreign observer the religious behaviour of the English at that time\nlooked most peculiar. Religious uniformity remained the rule, as on the\nContinent, but religion changed with each sovereign. After having been\nschismatic under Henry VIII, and Protestant under Edward VI, England became\nagain, and without any serious upheaval, Roman Catholic under Mary\nTudor.[78](ch02b_fn68.html#ch02b_fn68fn78)\n\nMerely nationalist excitement about the English vernacular was embedded in\nreligious controversy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Religion and\npolitics had become so interfused as to be indistinguishable. The Puritan\nJames Hunt wrote in 1642:\n\nFor henceforth no man shall need the Universities,  \nFor to learn the wisedom of the wise;  \nFor there are very few mysteries in the Gospel  \nthat be so strong  \nBut they may be unfolded by the plaine  \ntrue English tongue.[79](ch02b_fn68.html#ch02b_fn68fn79)\n\nAt the present time the concern among Catholic liturgists about the question\nof the mass in English, is utterly confused by the new media such as movie,\nradio, and TV. For the social role and function of a vernacular are constantly\nbeing shifted by the means of interrelating it to private life. Thus the\nquestion of the mass in English today is as confused as the role of English in\nreligion and politics in the sixteenth century. Nobody will question that it\nwas the medium of print that then gave the vernaculars new functions, and\nutterly changed the uses and relevance of Latin. By the eighteenth century, on\nthe other hand, the relations between language, religion, and politics had\nclarified. Language had become religion, in France at least.\n\nIf the original Jacobins were sluggish in translating all their theories of\neducation into action, they were prompt to recognize the significance of\nlanguage as the basis of nationality and to try to compel all inhabitants of\nFrance to use the French language. They contended that successful rule by “the\npeople” and united action by the nation were dependent, not only on a certain\nuniformity of habits and customs, but even more on an identity of ideas and\nideals which could be effected by speeches, the printing press, and other\ninstruments of education, provided that these employed one and the same\nlanguage. Confronted with the historic fact that France was not a linguistic\nunit – that, in addition to widely variant dialects in different parts of the\ncountry, “foreign” languages were spoken in the west by Bretons, in the south\nby Provencals, Basques, and Corsicans, in the north by Flemings, and in the\nnortheast by Alsatian Germans – they resolved to stamp out the dialects and\nthe foreign languages and to force every French citizen to know and employ the\nFrench language.[80](ch02b_fn69.html#ch02b_fn69fn80)\n\nHayes in this passage makes it quite clear that the passion behind the\nvernacular drive was homogenization, a matter which the Anglo-Saxon world has\nalways understood is much better managed by price rivalry and consumer goods.\nIn a word, the English world understands that print means applied knowledge,\nwhile the Latin world has always held print at bay, preferring to use it to\nenhance the drama of oral disputation or military virtuosity. Nowhere can this\ndeep rejection of the print message be better seen than in _The Structure of\nSpanish History_ by Americo Castro.\n\n### **The Spaniards had been immunized against typography by their age-old\nquarrel with the Moors.**\n\nAs the Jacobeans got the military message of print as lineal levelling\naggression, the English were applying print to production and markets. So\nwhile the English were extending print to prices, shop-keeping and do-it-\nyourself hand books of every kind, the Spaniards had abstracted from print the\nmessage of gigantism and supra-human effort. The Spaniard bypassed or ignored\nthe entire aspect of print as applied, as levelling, homogenizing. There is no\nintent or wish to set up any other standards. Castro writes (p. 620):\n\nThey rebel against standards as such. There is a kind of personal separatism.\n… If I had to locate, as it were, that which is most characteristic of\nHispanic life, I would put it between the acceptance of inertia and the\nwillful outburst through which the person reveals what there is – be it\nsomething insignificant or something of value – in the depths of his soul, as\nif he were his own theatre. Visible examples of this enormous contrast are the\npeasant and the conquistador – insensibility to the political and social\nsituations and the insurrections and convulsions of the blind mass of the\npeople, destroying everything; apathy toward the transformation of natural\nresources into wealth and the use of public wealth as if it were private;\narchaic and static ways of living and the hasty adoption of modern devices\nproduced outside of Spain. The electric light, the typewriter, and the\nfountain-pen were popularized in Spain more quickly than in France. On the\nplane of the highest human values we find a manifestation of this sharp\ncontrast in the poetic inwardness of Saint John of the Cross or of the\nquietist Miguel de Molinos, and the series of daring assaults to be found in\nQuevedo and Góngora, or in Goya’s artistic transformation of the outer world.\n\nThe Spaniards are not in the least averse to the acceptance and import of\nthings and ideas from outside: “In 1480 Ferdinand and Isabella authorized the\nfree importation of foreign books.” Later they were subjected to censorship,\nand Spain began to attenuate its lines of communication with the rest of the\nworld. Castro explains (p. 664) how:\n\nThe Spaniards have expanded and contracted the objective zone of their life in\na dramatic rhythm: they are not inclined to industrial activity, nor will they\nagree to live without industry. At certain moments the outward sallies, the\nefforts to break out of themselves, … give rise to problems that have no\n“normal” mode of solution.\n\nPerhaps the most spectacular effect of print in the Renaissance was the\nmilitant campaign of counter-Reformation mounted by Spaniards like St.\nIgnatius Loyola. His religious order, the first since printing began, embodied\nmuch visual stress in religious exercises, intense literary training, and\nmilitary homogeneity of organization. Writing his _Apologie of Two English\nSeminaries_ in 1581, Cardinal Allen explains the new militancy of missionary\nzeal among Catholics: “Books opened the way.” The book as a militant\nmissionary affair did appeal to the Spaniard who yet rejected commerce and\nindustry. The Spaniard, according to Castro (p. 624), has always manifested\nhostility towards the written word:\n\nThe Spaniard wants a system of justice based on value judgements, not on firm\nand rationally deduced principles. It is not accident that casuistry was\nfostered by the Spanish Jesuits, nor that the Frenchman Pascal should find\nthis casuistry perversely immoral. It is written laws that the Spaniard fears\nand despises: “I find twenty chapters against you and only one that is with\nyou,” says a lawyer to the unfortunate litigant in the _Rimado de palacio_ by\nPero López de Ayala …\n\nIt is one of Castro’s principal themes that the structure of Spanish history\nis axiologically inclined between the literate West and the oral Moorish East.\n“Even Cervantes expresses more than once a longing for Moorish justice, in\nspite of his long captivity in Algiers.” And it was the Moorish strain which\nimmunized the Spaniards against the visual quantifications of literacy. Study\nof the Spanish case offers especially significant light on the diverse effects\nof literacy as print technology encounters unique cultures. The Spanish\npreference for living at the passionate centre may have an analogue in Russia\nwhere, unlike Japan, the effects of print technology have not extended to the\ndiscovery of consumer goods. And the oral Russian attitude to technology has a\npassionate character that may inure them, too, against the uses of literacy.\n\nCastro has a fine essay on “Incarnation in Don Quixote” in _Cervantes across\nthe Centuries_ ([pp. 136](ch02a.html#page_136)–78) in which he observes that:\n“The preoccupation with noting the effects of reading upon the vital processes\nof readers is characteristically Spanish.” Not only is this very fact the\nprincipal theme of Don Quixote:\n\nThe effect of books (religious or profane) upon the life of the reader is an\never-present theme in the letters of the 16th century. The youth of Ignatius\nof Loyola was spent very much in tune with the novels of chivalry, which “he\nwas very curious and fond of reading.” But chance placed in his hands a life\nof Christ and a _Flos Sanctorum_. “Not only did he begin to find enjoyment,\nbut his heart also began to change, and he was filled with the desire to\nimitate and put into action what he read.” While still undecided between\nearthly and heavenly values, he sheltered within him both the person that he\nhad been and the one that that great incited man aspired to be: “Then there\nfollowed a sovereign light and wisdom, that Our Lord _infused_ into his mind.”\n([p. 163](ch02a.html#page_163))\n\nBy way of explanation of this peculiar Spanish consciousness of literary\neffects, Castro considers ([p. 161](ch02a.html#page_161)) that: “To feel books\nas a living, animate, communicable and inciting reality is a human phenomenon\nbelonging to Oriental tradition …” And it may be this oriental sensitivity to\n_form_ , progressively numbed in the world of the alphabet, that accounts for\nthe unique Spanish outlook on print: “… but the peculiarity of sixteenth-\ncentury Spain was the attention accorded to the vital effect of the printed\nword upon its readers; the communicative power of the word was stressed above\neven errors and literary defects of the books themselves.” ([p.\n164](ch02a.html#page_164))\n\nThe Spanish concern, then, was with the very medium of print as effecting a\nnew ratio of the senses, a new mode of consciousness. As Casalduero puts it in\n_Cervantes across the Centuries_ ([p. 63](ch02.html#page_63)): “Knight and\nSquire are neither opposites nor complements to one another. They are of the\nsame nature with a difference in proportion. The comic spirit arises from the\njuxtaposition of these diverse proportions which are translated plastically.”\nWith regard to the peculiar Spanish stress on the medium of the printed word,\nStephen Gilman in a chapter on “The Apocryphal ‘Quixote’” in the same book\nnotes ([p. 248](ch02b.html#page_248)) that authorship in Spain was secondary:\n“The reader is more important than the writer.” But this is a long way from\nthe idea of “what the public wants,” for it is the notion of the medium of the\nlanguage itself as a public trust rather than of the reader as private\nconsumer. R. F. Jones encountered this attitude in the early sixteenth century\nin England:\n\nThe refinement and adornement of the mother tongue were themselves considered\nthe goal of literature. In other words, literature was considered instrumental\nto language, not language to literature. Writers are more frequently praised\nfor what they have done for the medium of their expression than for the\nintrinsic value of their compositions. …[81](ch02b_fn70.html#ch02b_fn70fn81)\n\n### **Print had the effect of purifying Latin out of existence.**\n\nMany great scholars have toiled at the study of the printed English\nvernacular. So rich is the field that any kind of approach is arbitrarily\nselective. Writing on “Tyndale and the English Language,” G. D. Bone brings\nout: “Tyndale’s task was to make real the common life of the gospels. He was\nto rediscover the parables. … Before they possessed the Bible in their own\nlanguage few people considered that a story in some way acquired more weight\nif it were actually a reflection of common\nlife.”[82](ch02b_fn70.html#ch02b_fn70fn82)\n\nImplied here is the suggestion that the language of everyday life when _seen_\nevokes the need for a literature of everyday life. Print applied to\nvernaculars transformed them into mass media, which was not too strange since\ntypography was the first form of mass production. But print applied to Latin\nwas a disaster: “The efforts of the great Italian humanists, from Petrarch in\nhis _Africa_ to Cardinal Bembo, had the unexpected effect of purifying Latin\nout of active existence.”[83](ch02b_fn70.html#ch02b_fn70fn83)\n\nC. S. Lewis in _English Literature in the Sixteenth Century_ ([p.\n21](ch02.html#page_21)) writes:\n\nIt is largely to the humanists that we owe the curious conception of the\n“classical” period in a language, the correct or normative period before which\nall was immature or archaic and after which all was decadent. Thus Scaliger\ntells us that Latin was “rude” in Plautus, “ripe” from Terence to Virgil,\ndecadent in Martial and Juvenal, senile in Ausonius (_Poetices_ viii). Vives\nsays much the same (_De tradendis disciplinis_ iv). Vida, more wildly, makes\nall Greek poetry after Homer a decline (_Poeticorum_ I, 139). When once this\nsuperstition was established it led naturally to the belief that good writing\nin the fifteenth or sixteenth century meant writing which aped as closely as\npossible that of the chosen period in the past. All real development of Latin\nto meet the changing needs of new talent and new subject-matter was thus\nprecluded; with one blow of “his Mace petrific” the classical spirit ended the\nhistory of the Latin tongue. This was not what the humanists had intended.\n\nFebvre and Martin point also (in _L’Apparation du livre_ , p. 479) to the role\nof the revival of ancient Roman script. “Even more, the return to the antique\nletters contributed to make of Latin a dead language.” This is a basic point.\nThe very letters which we associate with print itself were not medieval but\nRoman and were used by the humanists as part of their archeological effort.\nBut the high visual quality of Roman script, so congenial to the printing\npress, was the main factor in ending the reign of Latin, even more than the\nrevival of ancient styles by means of the printed word.\n\nPrint permitted the direct visual confrontation of the ancient styles in all\ntheir fixity. The humanists were shocked to discover how far they were in\ntheir oral Latin modes from all classical precedent. They decided at once to\nteach Latin by the printed page rather than by discourse, as a means of\nstopping the further spread of their own barbarous medieval Latin speech and\nidiom. Lewis concludes ([p. 21](ch02.html#page_21)): “They succeeded in\nkilling the medieval Latin: but not in keeping alive the schoolroom severities\nof their restored Augustanism.”\n\n### **Typography extended its character to the regulation and fixation of\nlanguages.**\n\nLater ([pp. 83](ch02.html#page_83)–4), Lewis contrasts the Renaissance\nschoolroom “classicality” with the oral and auditory freedom and variety of\nthe medieval Latinity of Gavin Douglas, Bishop of Dunkeld. Douglas shocks us\nby being closer to Virgil than we. Once a man’s eyes have been opened to this,\nhe will find instances everywhere. _Rosea cervice refulsit_ : “her nek schane\nlike unto the rois in May.” Do you prefer Dryden’s “She turned and made appear\nher neck refulgent”? But _refulsit_ cannot possibly have had for a Roman ear\nthe “classical” quality which “refulgent” has for an English. It must have\nfelt much more like “schane.”\n\nWhat we feel as “classical” in the Augustans and the eighteenth century, that\nis to say, has to do with the large stratum of Latin neologism which was\nimported into English by the translators of the first age of print. R. F.\nJones in his _The Triumph of the English Language_ devotes much space to this\nbasic matter of the vernacular and neologism. He also discusses at length two\nquestions directly related to the printed form of any language at all, namely\nthe drive for fixity of spelling and grammar.\n\nFebvre and Martin devote a chapter of their _L’Apparition du livre_ to\n“Printing and Languages,” pointing to “the essential role of print in the\nformation and fixation of languages. Until the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury,” the forms of written discourse, Latin or vernacular, “had continued\nto evolve after the pattern of the spoken language.” (p. 477) Manuscript\nculture had no power to fix language or to transform a vernacular into a mass\nmedium of national unification. Medievalists point to the impossibility of a\nLatin dictionary for the Middle Ages, simply because a medieval author felt\nfree to define his terms progressively by the changing contexts of his\nthought. The idea of a word having a definite meaning fixed by some lexicon\nsimply could not have occurred to him. In the same way, before writing, words\ndo not have any external “sign,” reference or significance. The word “oak” is\noak, says the non-literate man; how else could it evoke the idea of oak? But\nprint had just as far-reaching results in every aspect of language as writing\nhad earlier. Whereas medieval vernaculars changed very much even from the\ntwelfth to the fifteenth centuries, “from the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury these matters were no longer thus. By the seventeenth century\nvernaculars everywhere begin to appear crystalized.”\n\nFebvre and Martin then point to the efforts made in medieval chancelleries to\nstandardize verbal practices, and in the new centralist Renaissance monarchies\nto fix languages. The new monarch would gladly have passed Acts of Uniformity,\nin the spirit of the printing press to extend not only to religion and thought\nbut to spelling and grammar. Today in the electronic age of simultaneity all\nthese policies have had to be reversed, beginning with the new drive for\ndecentralism and pluralism in big business itself. That is why it is so easy\nnow to understand the dynamic logic of printing as a centralizing and\nhomogenizing force. For all the effects of print technology now stand in stark\nopposition to the electronic technology. In the sixteenth century the whole of\nancient and medieval culture stood in equally conflicting relation to the new\nprint technology. In Germany, more pluralistic and tribally diverse than the\nrest of Europe, “the unifying services of printing in the formation of a\nliterary language” were strikingly effective. And, write Febvre and Martin (p.\n483):\n\nLuther made a language which in all domains approaches modern German. The\nenormous diffusion of his works, their literary quality, the quasi-sacred\ncharacter which belonged in the eyes of the faithful to the text of the Bible\nand of the New Testament as established by him, all this soon made his\nlanguage a model. Accessible immediately to all readers … the term employed by\nLuther finally conquered, and numerous words used only in medieval German were\nfinally adopted universally. And his vocabulary imposed itself in so imperious\na fashion that most printers did not dare to diverge from it in the least.\n\nBefore looking at the English evidence for the same concern with regularity\nand uniformity among printers and print uses alike, it is well to remind\nourselves of the rise of structural linguistics in our day. Structuralism in\nart and criticism stemmed, like non-Euclidean geometrics, from Russia.\nStructuralism as a term does not much convey its idea of inclusive\nsynesthesia, an interplay of many levels and facets in a two-dimensional\nmosaic. But it is a mode of awareness in art language and literature which the\nWest took great pains to eliminate by means of Gutenberg technology. It has\nreturned in our time, for good or ill, as this opening paragraph of a recent\nbook[84](ch02b_fn71.html#ch02b_fn71fn84) indicates:\n\nLanguage gives evidence of its reality through three categories of human\nexperience. The first may be considered as the meaning of words; the second,\nas those meanings enshrined in grammatical forms; and the third and, in the\nview of this author, the most significant, as those meanings which lie beyond\ngrammatical forms, those meanings mysteriously and miraculously revealed to\nman. It is with the last category that this chapter will endeavor to deal, for\nits thesis is that thought itself must be accompanied by a critical\nunderstanding of the relation of linguistic expression to the deepest and most\npersistent intuitions of man. An effort will further be made to show that\nlanguage becomes imperfect and inadequate when it depends exclusively upon\nmere words and forms and when there is an uncritical trust in the adequacy of\nthese words and forms as constituting the ultimate content and extent of\nlanguage. For man is that being on earth who does not have language. Man _is_\nlanguage.\n\n### **Print altered not only the spelling and grammar but the accentuation and\ninflection of languages, and made**BAD GRAMMAR** possible.**\n\nIn our time it is extremely evident that man is language, though he now\nrecognizes many non-verbal languages as well as the language of forms. And\nthis structuralist approach to experience engenders the awareness that\n“unconsciousness in relation to the one who knows is\nnonexistence.”[85](ch02b_fn72.html#ch02b_fn72fn85) That is to say, that in so\nfar as print structured language and experience and motivation in new ways not\nrecognized in conscious ways, life was impoverished by mesmerism. Earlier in\nthis volume, Shakespeare was shown as providing his contemporaries with a\nworking model of print technology in action. For the separation of functions\nby mechanical inertia is the foundation of movable types and applied knowledge\nin all domains. It is a technique of reduction to a single level of problems,\ntalents, and solutions alike. Thus Dr. Johnson “was scandalized by the\nuntimeliness of many of Shakespeare’s puns. For a character to quibble in the\nteeth of death, as many do in the plays, was contrary to ‘reason, propriety\nand truth’.”[86](ch02b_fn72.html#ch02b_fn72fn86)\n\nNot only did simultaneity of meanings have to go with the change from oral to\nvisual culture, but pronunciation and pitch were flattened out so far as\npossible. Robert Hillyer writes in his _In Pursuit of Poetry_ ([p.\n45](ch02.html#page_45)):\n\nFor the most part, we Americans do not avail ourselves of changing pitch.\nUnconsciously we avoid it as an affectation and lose half the effectiveness of\nour native tongue in one long monotone of drone, drawl, or growl. The effect\nis flat and blurred, especially since we run our syllables and words together,\nlike a piece of prose without any punctuation. We ought to let every syllable\ncome out round and full like a golden bubble! But we don’t. The result is hard\non poetry. The American voice is, in general, far richer than the English.\nLeaving out Cockney – and that super-Cockney, the “Oxford accent” – we\nmistakenly accord superiority to the English _voice_ , whereas actually it is\nthe flexible _pitch_ that makes the Englishman’s talk so much more articulate\nthan ours. Pitch is to our language as gesticulation is to the French, its\nexpressiveness, its emphasis, and its point. The Elizabethans doubtless spoke\nthe language up and down through its whole gamut, and echoes of that eloquence\nlinger in the talk of Irishmen today. _Without sliding pitch the reading of\nverse cannot be effective_.\n\nAmericans have pursued the merely visual implications of print more whole-\nheartedly than anybody else, for reasons that will shortly appear. Gror\nDanielsson provides a wealth of specialist material to back up Hillyer in his\n_Studies on Accentuation of Polysyllabic Latin, Greek, and Romance Loan-words\nin English_.\n\nIt has already been shown in relation to art and science and scriptural\nexegesis how the Middle Ages had tended steadily towards visual stress. It is\nnow time to mention the gradual shift in medieval language, preparatory to the\nleap towards visual fixity represented by print.\n\nIn general, then, in respect to the expression of the subject and object\nrelations, the development in English has been away from inflectional devices\nwhich made it grammatically possible for subjects and objects to stand in\n_any_ position among the words of a sentence, to the use of grammatically\nfunctioning fixed word order patterns which made the position before the verb\n“subject” territory and the position after the verb, “object”\nterritory.[87](ch02b_fn73.html#ch02b_fn73fn87)\n\nInflexion is natural to the oral or auditory culture, for it is a mode of\nsimultaneity. Phonetic alphabetic culture strongly tends to reduce inflexion\nin favour of visual positional grammar. Edward P. Morris has a lucid statement\nof this principle in _On Principles and Methods in Latin Syntax_ where the\nvisual stress appears as\n\nmovement toward the expression of relation by single words. …\n\nThe general movement by which single words have in part taken the place of\ninflection is the most sweeping and radical change in the history of the Indo-\nEuropean languages. It is at once the indication and the result of a clearer\nfeeling of concept-relation. _Inflection in the main rather suggests than\nexpresses relations_ ; it is certainly not correct to say that in every case\nthe expression of relation by a single word, e.g., a preposition, is clearer\nthan the suggestion of the same relation by a case form, but it is correct to\nsay that the relation can become associated with a single word only when it is\nfelt with a considerable degree of clearness. The relation between concepts\nmust itself become a concept. To this extent _the movement toward the\nexpression of relation by single words is a movement toward precision. …_ The\nadverb-preposition is the expression in more distinct form of some element of\nmeaning which was latent in the case-form. It serves therefore as a definition\nof the meaning of the case-form. ([pp. 102](ch02.html#page_102)–4)\n\n### **The levelling of inflexion and of wordplay became part of the program of\napplied knowledge in the seventeenth century.**\n\nIf there had never been a seventeenth century it could have been predicted\nthat the continuing print-inspired movement towards visual word order meant\nelimination of the principle of verbal decorum, the ending of wordplay, and\nthe insistence on homogeneity of utterance. Long before Bishop Sprat had\nworked out this implication of print for the Royal Society, Robert Cawdrey\nstates it plainly. In 1604 he argues that wit (which implied erudition at that\ntime) consisted not in strange words but\n\nin wholsom matter and apt declaring on a man’s mind. … we must of necessitie\nbanish all affected Rhetorique and use altogether one manner of language.\nThose therefore that will avoyde this follie, and acquaint themselves with the\nplainest and best kind of speech, must seek from time to time for such words\nas are commonlie received, and such as properly may expresse in plaine manner,\nthe whole conceit of their mind.[88](ch02b_fn74.html#ch02b_fn74fn88)\n\nThat we must “use altogether one manner of language” is a perfectly natural\ndeduction from visual experience of the printed vernacular. And as Bacon\nshowed, the reduction of talents and experience to a single level is the very\ncrux of _applied_ knowledge. But it is quite destructive of “the criterion of\ndecorum,” as Rosamund Tuve designates, in _Elizabethan and Metaphysical\nImagery_ , the principle that had informed the language arts continuously from\nthe Greeks to the Renaissance.\n\nLevels of style like levels of exegesis were part of an entire cultural\ncomplex, and exercised the thoughts of the Fathers with regard to the style of\nthe Bible a great deal. John Donne is merely rehearsing a patristic\ncommonplace when he writes: “The Holy Ghost in penning Scriptures delights\nhimself not only with a propriety, but with a delicacy, and harmony, and\nmelody of language; with height of Metaphors and other figures, which may work\ngreat impressions on the Readers, and not with barbarous or triviall, or\nmarket or homely language …”[89](ch02b_fn75.html#ch02b_fn75fn89)\n\nIgnorance of the continuous operation of the principle of decorum in styles\nmisled people like R. W. Chambers into notions of plain simple styles as\ngrowing out of some happy new principle of literary practice. Thus Bede, who\nwrote in all styles, is congratulated in the _Cambridge History of English\nLiterature_ because in his _Ecclesiastical History_ : “It seems to be one\ngreat service he rendered to English writers that he gave currency to direct\nand simple style.”\n\nR. W. Chambers confused the later nineteenth century cult of oral, colloquial\nsimplicity with the sixteenth century practice of the low style in devotional\ntreatises and sermons. Thomas More uses the high style in _Richard III_ , and\nmiddle style for his satire the _Utopia_ , and low style for his devotional\nwork. Part of Donne’s sophistication in decorum is a daring use of imagery\nfrom humble crafts in order to pose the paradoxes of the Divine humility of\nthe Incarnation. The purpose here, however, is merely to indicate the range\nand depth of the tradition of decorum in the use of language for varied\nthemes. For with print it had to be sheered off so that men could “use\naltogether one manner of language.” The need to homogenize every kind of\nsituation, in order to get the whole culture in rapport with the potential of\nthe print technology, is an easily recognizable and understandable attitude.\nBishop Sprat in his _History of the Royal Society_ (1667) is prepared to\ndispense, not only with decorum and levels of style, but with poetry itself.\nMyths and fables were the fanciful rhetoric of the childhood of the race:\n\nthe first masters of knowledge among them were as well Poets, as Philosophers;\nfor Orpheus, Linus, Musaeus and Homer, first softened men’s natural rudeness,\nand by the charms of their Numbers, allur’d them to be instructed by the\nseverer doctrines of Solon, Thales and Pythagoras. This was a course that was\nuseful at first, when men were to be delightfully deceiv’d to their own good.\nBut perhaps it left some ill influence, on the whole Philosophy of their\nSuccessors; and gave the Grecians occasion ever after of exercising their wit,\nand their imagination, about the works of Nature, more than was consistent\nwith a sincere Inquiry into them[90](ch02b_fn76.html#ch02b_fn76fn90)\n\nBy a kind of metamorphosis it follows from Sprat’s position (which tries to\nfollow Bacon) that the modern scientist or philosopher is the true poet. And\nin order to purge the dross of the past from the present, Sprat sees the Royal\nSociety as having “endeavour’d to separate the knowledge of Nature from the\ncolours of Rhetorick, the devices of Fancy, or the delightful deceit of\nFables.”\n\nThe procedure of separation and segmentation as the very technique of\n_applied_ knowledge comes out clearly wherever a job of reducing antiquity\narises. The members of the Royal Society being privy to this technique,\nrepudiate “this vicious abundance of Phrase, this trick of Metaphors, this\nvolubility of Tongue, which makes so great a noise in the world.”\n\nThey have therefore been most rigorous in putting into execution, the only\nRemedy that can be found for this extravagance: and that has been, a constant\nResolution, to reject all the amplifications, digressions, and swellings of\nstyle: _to return back to the primitive purity, and shortness_ , when men\ndeliver’d so many things, almost in an equal number of words. _They have\nexacted from all their members, a close, naked, natural way of speaking;\npositive expressions, clear senses; a native easiness; bringing all things as\nnear the Mathematical plainness, as they can: and preferring the language of\nArtizans, Countrymen, and Merchants, before that, of Wits, or Scholars_.\n[91](ch02b_fn76.html#ch02b_fn76fn91)\n\n### **Print created national\n\nuniformity and government centralism, but also individualism and opposition to\ngovernment as such.**\n\nAt this point of reduction of all language to one mode, we are not really\ndisengaged from the original meaning of print in transforming the vernaculars\ninto mass media of nationalist significance. It will repay us to dip more than\na century behind Sprat in order to follow the contours of the original\nmanifestation of print as a means of uniformity.\n\nKarl Deutsch writes in his _Nationalism and Social Communication_ ([pp.\n78](ch02.html#page_78)–9):\n\n_a nationality_ is a people pressing to acquire a measure of effective control\nover the behavior of its members. … nationalities turn into nations when they\nacquire power to back up their aspirations. Finally, if their nationalistic\nmembers are successful, and a new or old state organization is put into their\nservice, then at last the nation has become sovereign, and a _nation-state_\nhas come into being.\n\nCarleton Hayes has made it plain that there was no nationalism before the\nRenaissance, and we have now seen enough of the character of print technology\nto know why this should be so. For if print made the vernaculars into mass\nmedia, they also constituted a means of central government control of society\nbeyond anything that even the Romans had known with papyrus and alphabet and\npaved roads. But the very nature of print creates two conflicting interests as\nbetween producers and consumers, and between rulers and ruled. For print as a\nform of centrally organized mass-production ensures that the problem of\n“freedom” will henceforth be paramount in all social and political discussion.\nIn Library Week, March 17, 1950, the _Minneapolis Morning Tribune_ , in an\neditorial entitled “The Right to Read,” quoted a joint statement by Herbert\nHoover and Harry Truman: “We Americans know that if freedom means anything, it\nmeans the right to think. And the right to think means the right to read –\nanything, written anywhere, by any man, at any time.” This is an impressive\nstatement of consumer doctrine based on the homogeneity of print. If print is\nuniform, it should create uniform rights for writer and reader, publisher and\nconsumer. The American colonies were first settled by people who had long had\nexperience of the exactly opposite idea of the meaning of print. The producer-\noriented or ruler-oriented version of the message of Gutenberg is simply that\nit is the ruler’s right to impose uniform patterns of behaviour on society.\nThe police state precedes the consumer society. It is interesting, therefore,\nto read an American account of _Freedom of the Press in England, 1476–1776:\nThe Rise and Decline of Government Controls_ , by F. S. Siebert, for it\nprovides a fine view of the relative advantages in producer-imposed _versus_\nconsumer-created uniformity. It is the perpetual and ironic alternation of\nthese two positions that gives to Alexis de Tocqueville’s _Democracyin\nAmerica_ its rich fascination. The same contrast between the interests of\ncentralized government and those of settlers is the theme of _The Fur Trade in\nCanada_ by Harold Innis. For, writes Innis (p. 388), it was the interest of\nthe centre to organize the margins for the production of staples, not of\nconsumer goods:\n\nLarge scale production of raw materials was encouraged by improvement of\ntechnique of production, of marketing, and of transport as well as by\nimprovement in the manufacture of the finished product. As a consequence,\nenergy in the colony was drawn into the production of the staple commodity\nboth directly and indirectly. Population was involved directly in the\nproduction of the staple and indirectly in the production of facilities\npromoting production. Agriculture, industry, transportation, trade, finance,\nand governmental activities tend to become subordinate to the production of\nthe staple for a more highly specialized manufacturing community. These\ngeneral tendencies may be strengthened by governmental policy as in the\nmercantile system but the importance of these policies varies in particular\nindustries. Canada remained British in spite of free trade and chiefly because\nshe continued as an exporter of staples to a progressively industrialized\nmother country.\n\nThe War of Independence of 1776, Innis explains, was the clash between centre\nand margin, which is identical with the conflict between conformity and non-\nconformity, politics and literature, in the sixteenth century. And just as “a\ncolony engaged in the fur trade was not in a position to develop industries to\ncompete with manufactures of the mother country,” so the margins also\ndeveloped a merely consumer attitude to literature and the arts, such as has\nlingered until this century.\n\nThe non-conformists inclined to the reader or consumer side, interpreting the\nmeaning of print to be private and individual. The conformists inclined to the\nauthor-publisher, ruler of the new force. It may or may not be significant\nthat most of English literature since printing has been created by this ruler-\noriented minority.\n\nSays Siebert ([p. 25](ch02.html#page_25)): “The Tudor policy of strict control\nover the press in the interest of the safety of the state was maintained\nthroughout the sixteenth century.” It was inevitable that with printing the\nsixteenth century should also witness “a large increase in the powers –\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial – of the Council (or Privy Council) at\nthe expense of both Parliament and the older courts, but to the distinct\nadvantage of the crown.” But as the book market enlarged and the habit of much\nreading spread widely toward the end of the century, the consumer revolt\nagainst central controls got ever stronger. L. B. Wright’s splendid account of\n_Middle-Class Culture in Elizabethan England_ provides an image of the complex\nuses of print to foster many varieties of self-education and self-help. It\nbecomes obvious how the first age of readers was not merely seeking diversion\nbut instruction in methods of applied knowledge.\n\nThe reader of Wright’s work will easily appreciate how the centralist\nstructure of Elizabeth was being undermined from within by a new variety of\nrugged individualists:\n\nIsolated groups had already begun to challenge the system of government\ncontrols, the printers for economic reasons, the Puritans for religious\nreasons, and at least one member of Parliament for political reasons. Printers\nlike Wolfe chafed under the rules of the Stationers Company. They rebelled\nagainst the printing privileges and the patents of monopoly. The religious\nnonconformists, denied the privilege of appealing to public opinion, darted\nabout inserting wedges with which they eventually wrecked the entire\nstructure.[92](ch02b_fn77.html#ch02b_fn77fn92)\n\nIt would need a book in itself to explain how the Enclosure movement was\nrelated to the centralism of the print process. But no further example of the\npower of print to enhance central power need be sought beyond the Act of\nUniformity of Elizabeth in 1559. The bill was opposed in the Lower House of\nConvocation on the ground that no government could possess “authority to treat\nof or to define whatever concerns the faith, the sacraments and ecclesiastical\ndiscipline …” But liturgy and church observance were an easy mark for print,\ndepending as they long had on book form. As from June 24, 1559, the Prayer\nBook of 1552 was to be “in full force and effect,” all ministers being\nthenceforth “bounden to say and use the Matins, Evensong, celebration of the\nLord’s Supper and administration of each of the sacraments, and all their\ncommon and open prayer” as these are in the book “and none other or other\nwise.”\n\nIn 1562 the Book of Homilies was issued for universal public reading from\nevery pulpit. Their content is not our concern, but rather their being\nuniformly imposed on the entire public. By making the vernacular a mass\nmedium, print created a new instrument of political centralism previously\nunavailable. And at the same time, as personal and political conformity became\nmatters of sharp formulation, scholars and teachers began a concerted drive\nfor correct spelling and grammar.\n\n### **Nobody ever made a grammatical error in a nonliterate society.**\n\nThe intensity of the ferment concerning orthography is only a useful index to\nthe novelty of print and its effects of central conformity. Charles Carpenter\nFries, in his _American English Grammar_ , studies the question of the clash\nbetween written and oral discourse: “Only the sixty-six most common strong\nverbs have resisted the pull of the regular pattern. … As a matter of fact,\nduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there was a strong tendency to\neliminate the distinction of form between the past tense and the past\nparticiple in all of these verbs …” ([p. 61](ch02.html#page_61))\n\nPrint had a levelling function on all verbal and social forms, it had been\nsaid over and over again. And where print has left some inflections unchanged,\nas in “who-whom,” there yawns the great booby-trap of “correct grammar” – that\nis to say, the abyss between visual and oral modes. The status of these issues\nin the electronic age is sufficiently indicated in a _Time_\nreport[93](ch02b_fn78.html#ch02b_fn78fn93) from the British House of Lords:\n\nIn debating the merits of a bill concerning the rights and liabilities of\nhotel proprietors, Britain’s House of Lords found itself up against a\nmomentous question: should an _a_ or an _an_ precede _hotel_? In favor of _an_\nwas Lord Faringdon, who begged “your Lordships to join me in making a\ndemonstration in favor of elegance.” Lord Conesford agreed, pointed out that\n_h_ words that are not accented on the first syllable demand _an_. “I\nbelieve,” said he, “that everyone of your Lordships would say ‘a Harrow boy,’\nbut would also speak of ‘an Harrovian.’” But what, asked Lord Rea, would Lord\nConesford do with one-syllable words? “In the case of an inn sign of a public\nhouse, would he look at it as ‘A Horse and a Hound’ or ‘An Orse and an Ound’?”\nLord Merthyr fell back on no less an authority than Fowler to prove that _an\nhotel_ would be hopelessly old-fashioned – but to no avail. When the debate\nwas over, the _ans_ won out. Said _a_ -man Lord Merthyr of _an_ -man Lord\nFaringdon, an Etonian like himself: “It is rather sad to think that the noble\nLord and I should have been educated in the same place, and at the same time,\nand that 40 years later we should come here to differ upon this question.”\n\nIt is presumably impossible to make a grammatical error in a non-literate\nsociety, for nobody ever heard one. The difference between oral and visual\norder sets up the confusions of the ungrammatical. In the same way the passion\nfor spelling reform in the sixteenth century arose from the new effort to\nadjust sight and sound. Sir Thomas Smith had argued that “a letter had an\ninherent nature which made it appropriate to one sound only.” This is the one-\nthing-at-a-time of the natural victim of print. And there were many who\nextended this logic to the meanings of words as well. But many rugged\ncharacters like Richard Mulcaster rallied against this visual logic, just as\nDr. Johnson was to rally against the visual logic of the doctrine of the\ndramatic unities.\n\n### **The reduction of the tactile qualities of life and language constitute\nthe refinement sought in the Renaissance\n\nand repudiated now in the electronic age.**\n\nA major theme of the passionate vernacular nationalists brings us to the\neffect of print in swiftly depriving language of many of its tactile\nqualities. Until the nineteenth century there was a common boast of\n“refinement” of the English tongue that had occurred since the sixteenth\ncentury. In the sixteenth century there was still plenty of brogue and dialect\nto confer tactility and resonance. Even by 1577 Holinshed could feel happy\nabout the gradual refinement between the language of the Saxons and the\nrelative perfection of his own time. The old Saxon English was\n\nand hard and rough kinde of speach, god wotte, when our nation was brought\nfirst into acquaintance withall, but now chaunged with vs into a farre more\nfine and easie kind of vtterunce, and so polished and helped with new and\nmilder wordes that it is to be aduouched howe there is no one speache vnder\nthe sonne spoken in our time, that hath or can haue more varietie of words,\ncopie of phrases, or figures or floures of eloquence, than hath our English\ntongue.[94](ch02b_fn79.html#ch02b_fn79fn94)\n\nThe reduction of tactile quality in life and language is ever the mark of\nrefinement. And it was not till the pre-Raphaelites and Hopkins that a\ndeliberate campaign for Saxon tactile values in language was to begin in\nEnglish. Yet tactility is the mode of interplay and of being rather than of\nseparation and of lineal sequence. A brief look at the effects of print in\nreshaping our ideas of space and of time will bridge across into the next\ncenturies after printing. For it is quite impossible to continue to advance on\nall fronts in the present book.\n\n### **The new time sense of typographic man is cinematic and sequential and\npictorial.**\n\nWith the stepping up of the isolated intensity and quantity by print the\nindividual is ushered into a world of movement and isolation. In every aspect\nof experience and affairs the stress is on separation of functions, analysis\nof components, and isolation of the moment. For with the isolation of the\nvisual, the feeling of interplay and of _light through_ the mesh of being\nyields, and “Human thought no longer feels itself a part of things.” What\nShakespeare refers to in _Lear_ as the “precious square of sense” probably has\nreference to the traditional “square of opposition” in logic and to that four-\npart analogy of proportionality which is the interplay of sense and reason.\nBut with the isolation of the visual by this new intensity, Reason is also\n\n… isolated from exterior time, [and] it feels also equally detached from the\ntime of its mental life. The modifications which happen to affect it by turns\ncan, indeed, in succeeding each other, give it the idea of an interior\nduration. But this duration, consisting in modes which replace one another, is\nby no means the duration of the thinking being; it is solely the duration of\nthe successive ensemble of man’s thoughts. Separated from the duration of\nthings, and even from that of the modes of its existence, the human\nconsciousness finds itself reduced to existence without duration. It is always\nof the present moment.[95](ch02b_fn80.html#ch02b_fn80fn95)\n\nThis is Macbeth’s world of “Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.” This, says\nPoulet, is the experience of modern man, and Montaigne, in his _Essays_ , was\nthe first to depict it. He set out to snapshot his own mind in the act of\nreading and reflection by way of _la peinture de la pensée_. In this respect\nMontaigne more than anybody else, perhaps, carried out the lesson of print as\nby a kind of applied knowledge. He bred up a great race of self-portrayers by\nmeans of the mental snapshot, of the sequence of the arrested and isolated\nmoments of experience which anticipate the cinema: “At first, on this island\nof the moment which isolates him but which he fills with his presence, man\nstill keeps something of the joy he experienced in the Renaissance when he\nfelt that he existed in all the reaches of space and duration. He is now given\nno more than a moment at a time, but each moment can be one of illumination\nand fullness. …”[96](ch02b_fn81.html#ch02b_fn81fn96)\n\nInseparably, however, from visual awareness and order, is the sense of\ndiscontinuity and a feeling of self-alienation: “Every hour we are swept away\nfrom ourselves,” says Boileau, and a hectic urgency invades the time sense:\n“Aware that the instant in which he thinks and wishes is slipping from under\nhim, man hurls himself into a new instant, an instant of a new thought and a\nnew wish: ‘But man without rest in his mad course / Flutters incessantly from\nthought to thought.’”[97](ch02b_fn81.html#ch02b_fn81fn97)\n\nFrom the isolated present moment, Poulet writes ([p. 19](ch02.html#page_19)),\n“God the creator and preserver is absent. The principal actor is no longer on\nthe scene. For the supereminent role of the first cause we find substituted\nthe play of second causes. In place of God there are feelings, sensations, and\nwhatever causes sensations.” Well, what causes sensations such as the above is\nunmistakably print technology with its power like Lear’s “darker purpose” to\ndivide the little kingdom of man into a batch of jarring atoms, and uniformly\nhomogenized components. Existence becomes, then, not _being_ but only “flux,\nshadow, and perpetual variation”; “I do not depict being,” says Montaigne; “I\ndepict passage.” Nothing could be more cinematic than that. Renouncing the\ndepiction of what is favour of an illusion achieved by a sequence of static\n“shots” – this is _typography in extenso_. Let us recall _King Lear_ as a live\nmodel of the stripping of human institutions, and consciousness itself, by the\nprogressive isolation of the senses. Parallel to this psychological experiment\nin our time is the deprivation of sense under controlled conditions. But to\nanybody first undergoing the print experience there was an extreme specialism\nof sense, not felt again, perhaps, until the movies and then, shortly\nafterwards, radio. The Baroque painters did exactly as did Montaigne in\nshifting attention to the peripheries of vision. Poulet is quite right in\nsaying ([p. 43](ch02.html#page_43)), therefore:\n\nBut to renounce the depiction of being for the depiction of passage is not\nonly an enterprise of unprecedented denudation; it is a task of extreme\ndifficulty. To depict passage is not simply to seize oneself in an object\nwhich fades away and by its own blurring lets the self appear more distinctly;\nit is not to paint a portrait of oneself which would be all the more faithful\nby the disappearance of all the traces of occasions which had led its\ncreation. It is to seize the self at the instant when the occasions remove\nfrom it its old form and impose upon it a new one.\n\nIt may be a mistake for Poulet or anybody else to see in this new strategy of\nMontaigne some extraordinarily profound discovery of enterprise. But just as\nthe infinitesimal calculus was devised to translate non-visual experience into\nhomogeneous visual terms, so Montaigne’s seizing the imperceptible instant or\nfacet, as “diversely and imperceptibly our soul darts out her passions,” is\nentering “the home of what Leibnitz was later to call the infinitely small\nentities. … It is a wager to attempt to ‘choose and lay hold of so many nimble\nlittle motions.’ … Thus the self is dissolved not only from instant to instant\nbut even in the middle of the instant-passage, in a prismatic play like that\nof a spray of water.”[98](ch02b_fn82.html#ch02b_fn82fn98)\n\nWhat is being presented here is identical with the methods of precise, visual\nquantification described by John U. Nef earlier. As Nef showed, these minute\nstatistical methods were the means of applied or translated knowledge.\nMontaigne had all the experiences and techniques of the impressionist film of\nour own time. And both modes of awareness are direct extrapolations of\ntypography when applied to the spoken word. In the midst of impressionism\nsymbolism strove to recover the unified field of being once more. It is easy\ntoday in an electronic milieu to understand the novelty of segmental\nimpressionist devices as they emerged from the sixteenth until the end of the\nnineteenth century. They are inseparable from the Gutenberg galaxy of events.\n\nAnd so with Descartes, for whom science is the anticipation of causes with\neffects: “Foundation of an admirable science which his mind conceives as an\nensemble of ‘Concatenated’ things: world of the _catena_ , of pure\ndeterminism. Spontaneity, liberty, piety have no part in\nit.”[99](ch02b_fn83.html#ch02b_fn83fn99) Having reduced knowledge to a merely\nvisual mode of sequence, “nothing can assure us of one instant’s being\ncontinued in another; nothing can guarantee to us that a bridge will be built\nbetween this instant and the following instant. … This is the strongest\nanxiety of all; the ‘terror,’ as Descartes calls it; the terror of _failure in\ntime_ against which there is no recourse except by a veritable leap to\nGod.”[100](ch02b_fn83.html#ch02b_fn83fn100) Poulet later (p. 357) describes\nthis “leap”:\n\nIn this manner the idea of God reappears to Descartes. Long neglected by the\nprimary consciousness absorbed in the _“science admirable_ ,” it reappears in\nthis spontaneous act of the secondary consciousness given to him by his dream.\nFrom this moment, so to speak, a change of atmosphere will occur in those\ndreamlike regions which seem to lead to some inevitable reality of despair.\nBut in order for Descartes to arrive finally at the true “shelter” and to find\nthe genuine “remedy,” he must endure other trials. The spontaneous act by\nwhich he turns toward God does not possess at this moment the necessary\nefficacy: it is not _pure_ spontaneity; it is not addressed directly to a God\nof the present, but to a God of the past …\n\n### **The denuding of conscious life and its reduction to a single level\ncreated the new world of the UNCONSCIOUS in the seventeenth century. The stage\nhas been cleared of the archetypes or postures of individual mind, and is\nready for the archetypes of the collective unconscious.**\n\nIt is thus that the seventeenth century, having emerged into a merely visual\nscience in its conscious life, is reduced to recourse to the world of dreams.\nThe mechanical spirit of movable types in precise lines, thus, could not have\nbeen given a more faithful reflection than by Descartes. We have earlier cited\nhis new consumer idea of philosophy, exhorting his reader to go through his\nwork “in its entirety like a novel without forcing the attention unduly upon\nit or stopping at difficulties.” The notion of moving steadily along on single\nplanes of narrative awareness is totally alien to the nature of language and\nof consciousness. But it is highly consistent with the nature of the printed\nword. Going closely with this lineal denudation of language is the associated\nimpression of mechanical repetition and recurrence which came to weigh ever\nmore heavily on the Renaissance mind:\n\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,  \nSo do our minutes hasten to their end;  \nEach changing place with that which goes before,  \nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.[101](ch02b_fn84.html#ch02b_fn84fn101)\n\nBut it had first a comic aspect which not only Shakespeare but Sidney\nexploited in his _Astrophel and Stella_ :\n\nYou that do dictionary’s method bring  \nInto your rimes, running in rattling rows;\n\nBut the examples of the new power of visual lineality are innumerable, one of\nthe most curious being the King James (1611) version of the Lord’s Prayer in\nwhich “debt” becomes “trespass.” The reduction of the multi-levelled idea of\n“debt” and duty is thus confined to the written legal meaning, and the idea of\n“stepping out of line” is substituted for a complex of theological and moral\nimplication.\n\nParadoxically, then, the first age of print introduced the first age of the\nunconscious. Since print allowed only a narrow segment of sense to dominate\nthe other senses, the refugees had to discover another home for themselves. We\nhave seen how aware of this meaning of the effects of print were the\nSpaniards. _Don Quixote_ is as much as _Lear_ a demonstration of the\ndichotomies of mind and heart and sense instituted by the printed book. More\npractical nations preferred to _live out_ these consequences rather than to\nmeditate upon them in live art models.\n\nLancelot Law Whyte in his _The Unconscious before Freud_ gives some idea of\nthe rise of the “discovery” of the unconscious as a result of the restriction\nof conscious life within the extreme limits of print technology. “Sink deep or\ntouch not the Cartesian spring” is the relevant jest of Joyce in _Finnegans\nWake_ ([p. 301](ch03.html#page_301)). But for centuries to come the West chose\nto be motivated by this simple mechanism and to live as in a dream from which\nartists strove to awaken us. Whyte says ([pp. 59](ch02.html#page_59)–60):\n\nThere have probably been individuals in every culture who knew that the\nfactors of which we are not directly aware influence thought and behavior. As\nI have suggested, this recognition must have been widespread, for example in\nChina where a more balanced and unified view of mind than that of Cartesian\nEurope was prevalent in some periods.\n\nSo far as the present book is concerned, it is not helpful to talk about the\nunconscious as the domain of the unknown, or as an area more profound than\nordinary consciousness. Even a restricted consciousness is far more\ninteresting than the unconscious profound. The concern here is to demonstrate\nhow by stressing the visual sense component in the sense ratio, we have\nourselves created that huge area of bathos and dulness which Pope celebrated\nin _The Dunciad_ and Swift in _The Tale of a Tub_. The unconscious is a direct\ncreation of print technology, the ever-mounting slag-heap of rejected\nawareness.\n\nNo thinker ever imagined that “body” and “mind” – insofar as the terms are\nvalid – are without apparent interactions. We must leave it to the Cartesian\nscholars, as Descartes did, to explain what it meant to postulate, as one of\nthe first products of clear thinking, two independent realms which are none\nthe less so intimately interdependent. The lesson is that the more brilliant\nthe light cast on two neighboring realms, the more profound the obscurity into\nwhich their interactions are thrown.[102](ch02b_fn85.html#ch02b_fn85fn102)\n\n### **Philosophy was as naive as science in its unconscious acceptance of the\nassumptions or dynamic of typography.**\n\nThe massive and abounding presence of printed matter and its derivatives in\nnew space and time organization gave prestige and authority to the absurdities\nhere cited by Whyte. Thus, for example, today children in schools, when\ninvited to consider the moronic quality of media offerings, are shocked. They\nentertain an unspoken assumption that whatever the adult world takes the time\nand trouble to perform is valid. They assume that grown-ups _en masse_ would\nnever be engaged in a depraved activity. It is only after teaching the\nlanguages of the media, from script to print and from print to TV, that this\nobvious fact is borne in on the mind. A Descartes is validated by his milieu,\nand by people engaged in living the mechanism he talks. Today in the new\nelectronic milieu Descartes gets short shrift and people now give to the\nunconscious the same fragmentary attention and acceptance that they had\npreviously given to the bright segmental moments of Cartesian awareness. Is it\nnot possible to emancipate ourselves from the subliminal operation of our own\ntechnologies? Is not the essence of education civil defence against media\nfall-out? Since the effort has never been made in any culture the answer may\nseem to lie in doubt. There may be some hitherto unsuspected and wise motive\nfor mental sleep and self-hypnosis in man which the confrontation of the\neffects of media technology would reveal. However this may be, it is plain\nthat the pseudo-dichotomies and visual quantities imposed on our psychology by\nprint began in the seventeenth century to assume the character of consumer\npackages or “systems” of philosophy. They are of the kind that can be\ndescribed and presented in a few minutes, but, thanks to the mesmerism of\nprint, were to occupy the attention of generations. Philosophies from\nDescartes onward are diverse in the way in which a steam engine differs from a\ngas or diesel engine. And Bergson, who tried to end it all, is as mechanical\nas his enemy Descartes, although he preferred a kind of cosmic fuel for his\nsystem. Once grant the stripping and segmenting process for language and\nexperience such as Shakespeare indicates in _Lear_ , and there is no possible\nstay. The rollercoaster is off over the Cartesian, Lockeian, Kantian course\nwith all the built-in panic and _Angst_ that could be asked for. Whyte sums it\nup ([pp. 60](ch02.html#page_60)–1):\n\nDuring the late seventeenth century three main attitudes dominated European\nphilosophical thought, corresponding to three interpretations of the nature of\nexistence. Materialism treated physical bodies and their motions as the\nprimary reality; idealism took it to be spirit or mind; while Cartesian\ndualism postulated two independent realms: the mental _res cogitans_ and the\nmaterial _res extensa_. For the first two schools there was no difficulty in\nrecognizing unconscious mentality though under other names. To the\nmaterialists all mentality was physiological, and the existence of unconscious\nphysiological processes, similar to and influencing thought, was an immediate\nconsequence of the fact that our direct awareness of the processes in our\nbodies is restricted. And to the idealists all natural processes were the\nexpression of a universal mind or world spirit of which the human individual\nhas no direct knowledge, though it shares, in some degree, the characteristics\nof human mentality. Thus for the idealists also there was no problem; the\nunconscious mind of the individual was not in any way surprising; it was\nmerely a part of the universal mind to which the individual awareness enjoyed\nno direct access. But to the third, Cartesian, school the admission of the\nexistence of unconscious mental processes presented an acute philosophical\nchallenge, for it demanded the discarding of the original conception of the\ndualism, as one of two independent realms, matter in motion and mind\nnecessarily aware. For those who were loyal to Descartes, all that was not\nconscious in man was material and physiological, and therefore not mental.\n\nThe last sentence will suggest to some that the present book is material and\nphysiological rather than mental in its assumptions. That is not the case, nor\nis it the theme. The point is, rather, how do we become aware of the effects\nof alphabet or print or telegraph in shaping our behaviour? For it is absurd\nand ignoble to be shaped by such means. Knowledge does not extend but restrict\nthe areas of determinism. And the influence of unexamined assumptions derived\nfrom technology leads quite unnecessarily to maximal determinism in human\nlife. Emancipation from that trap is the goal of all education. But the\nunconscious is no escape-hatch from a world of denuded categories any more\nthan Leibnitzian or any other monism is a resolution of Cartesian dualism.\nThere is still the full ratio or interplay of all the senses in concert, which\npermits light _through_. That concert comes to an end with the stepping up of\n_one_ sense by technology, and by the insistence of light _on_. The nightmare\nof light _on_ is the world of Pascal: “Reason acts slowly and with so many\nviews upon so many principles which always must be present, that at any time\nit may fall asleep or get lost, for want of having all its principles\npresent.”[103](ch02b_fn86.html#ch02b_fn86fn103)\n\n### **Heidegger surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as\nDescartes rode the mechanical wave.**\n\nThis kind of ballet of mind choreographed by Gutenberg by means of the\nisolated visual sense, is about as philosophical as Kant’s assumption of\nEuclidean space as _a priori_. But the alphabet and kindred gimmicks have long\nserved man as a subliminal source of philosophical and religious assumptions.\nCertainly Martin Heidegger would seem to be on better ground in using the\ntotality of language itself as philosophical datum. For there, at least in\nnon-literate periods, will be the ratio among _all_ the senses. But this is\nnot to recommend non-literacy, any more than the uses made of print are a\njudgment against literacy. In fact, Heidegger seems to be quite unaware of the\nrole of electronic technology in promoting his own non-literate bias in\nlanguage and philosophy. An enthusiasm for Heidegger’s excellent linguistics\ncould easily stem from naive immersion in the metaphysical organicism of our\nelectronic milieu. If the mechanism of Descartes looks paltry today, it may be\nfor the same subliminal reasons that it looked resplendent in its own time. In\nthat sense all fashions betoken somnambulism of some kind, and are one means\nof critical orientation to the psychic effects of technology. Perhaps this is\nthe way to help those who want to say: “But is there nothing good about\nprint?” The theme of this book is not that there is anything good or bad about\nprint but that unconsciousness of the effect of _any_ force is a disaster,\nespecially a force that we have made ourselves. And it is quite easy to test\nthe universal effects of print on Western thought after the sixteenth century,\nsimply by examining the most extraordinary developments in any art or science\nwhatever. Fragmented and homogeneous lineality, which appears as discovery in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, will become the popular novelty or\nutilitarian fashion of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. That is,\nmechanism persists as “novelty” into the electronic age that began with men\nlike Faraday. Some may feel that life is too valuable and delightful a thing\nto be spent in such arbitrary and involuntary automatism.\n\nPascal uses the Montaigne kodak trick of snapshotting moments in order to get\ninto a misery of dilemmas: “When we love ardently, it is always a novelty to\nsee the person beloved.” But this spontaneity is the product of simultaneity\nand instantaneous profusion. And the mind must take the elements one by one.\nHere then is the gratuitous and subliminal component of typography in Pascal.\nAll experience is segmental and must be processed sequentially. Therefore,\nrich experience eludes the wretched mesh or sieve of our attention. “One does\nnot show his greatness by being at one extreme, but in touching both extremes\nat once, and in filling in all the intermediate\nspace.”[104](ch02b_fn87.html#ch02b_fn87fn104) Of course, by setting up this\nlittle Gutenberg rack to anguish his spirit, Pascal insured himself public\nnotice and acceptance: “Those great efforts of the mind, which the soul\noccasionally reaches, are such as it cannot sustain. It reaches them only by a\nbound, not as on a throne, continuously, but for an instant\nonly.”[105](ch02b_fn88.html#ch02b_fn88fn105)\n\nPascal indicates that the old kind of consciousness was kingly, continuous,\n“as on a throne.” The old king had a role, not a job. He was an inclusive\ncentre-without-a-margin. The new consciousness like the new prince is a\nharassed executive, exercising a job, applying knowledge to problems, and\nhaving only momentary contacts with his marginal subjects, who are all\nambitious rival segments anyway.\n\nSays Poulet in what must be an irony ([p. 85](ch02.html#page_85)): “For an\ninstant! Shattering return to the misery of the human condition and to the\ntragedy of the experience of time: in the very instant man catches his prey,\nexperience dupes him, and he knows he is duped. His prey is a shadow. In the\ninstant he catches the instant, and the instant passes, for it is instant.”\n\nOne gets the uneasy feeling that these philosophers have undertaken expressly\nto dramatize the mechanism of Gutenberg in our sensibilities, acting it out\nlike all the King’s horses and all the King’s men, around old Humpty Dumpty.\nHow can one discover the principle of human identity amidst lineal sequences\nof moments? The self is obliged, such is the discontinuity of these\ntypographic moments, “each time to forget itself in order to re-invent itself,\nto reinvent itself in order to regain interest in itself, in short to effect a\nmocking simulacrum of continued creation, thanks to which it believes it will\nescape the authentication of its nothingness, and out of its nothingness\nrefashion a reality.”[106](ch02b_fn88.html#ch02b_fn88fn106)\n\nYet homogeneous repetition à _la_ Gutenberg still leaves something to be\ndesired in the way of a self. How is one to reason with the person who feeds\nhimself into a buzz-saw because the teeth are invisible? Such was the fate of\nthe unified “self” in the age of print segmentation. But it is hard to believe\nin the reality of anybody who in any age could take seriously the Gutenberg\nassumptions when applied to the ordering of life.\n\nJames Joyce certainly thought he had found in Vico a philosopher who had some\nbetter cultural awareness than those moved by the “Cartesian spring.” And\nVico, like Heidegger, is a philologist among philosophers. His time theory of\n_“ricorsi”_ has been interpreted by lineal minds to imply “recurrence.” A\nrecent study of him brushes this notion\naside.[107](ch02b_fn88.html#ch02b_fn88fn107)\n\nVico conceives the time-structure of history as “not linear, but contrapuntal.\nIt must be traced along a number of lines of development …” For Vico all\nhistory is contemporary or simultaneous, a fact given, Joyce would add, by\nvirtue of language itself, the simultaneous storehouse of all experience. And\nin Vico, the concept of recurrence cannot “be admitted at the level of the\ncourse of the nations through time”: “The establishment of providence\nestablishes universal history, the total presence of the human spirit to\nitself in idea. In this principle, the supreme ‘ricorso’ is achieved by the\nhuman spirit in idea, and it possesses itself, past, present, and future, in\nan act which is wholly consonant with its own\nhistoricity.”[108](ch02b_fn89.html#ch02b_fn89fn108)\n\n### **Typography cracked the voices of silence.**\n\nFrom the plastic and audile-tactile world of southern Italy came an answer to\nthe lineal anguish of the segmenters of the Gutenberg milieu. So thought\nMichelet and Joyce.\n\nLet us briefly return to the space question as affected by Gutenberg.\nEverybody is familiar with the phrase, “the voices of silence.” It is the\ntraditional word for sculpture. And if an entire year of any college program\nwere spent in understanding that phrase, the world might soon have an adequate\nsupply of competent minds. As the Gutenberg typography filled the world the\nhuman voice closed down. People began to read silently and passively as\nconsumers. Architecture and sculpture dried up too. In literature only people\nfrom backward oral areas had any resonance to inject into the language – the\nYeats, the Synges, the Joyces, Faulkners, and Dylan Thomases. These themes are\nlinked in the following paragraph by le Corbusier, which makes plain why stone\nand water are inseparable:\n\nAround the building, inside the building, there are definite places,\nmathematical points, which integrate the whole and establish platforms from\nwhich the sound of speech would reverberate in all parts. These are the\npredestined sites for sculpture. And that sculpture would be neither a metope,\na tympanum, nor a porch. It would be much more subtle and precise. The site\nwould be a place which would be like the focus of a parabola or an ellipse,\nlike the precise point of intersection of the different planes which compose\nthe architecture. From there the word, the voice would issue. Such places\nwould be focal points for sculpture, as they are focal points for acoustics.\nTake up your stand here, sculptor, if your voice is worth\nhearing.[109](ch02b_fn90.html#ch02b_fn90fn109)\n\nIt is merely trite to mention that man became the centre _via_ Gutenberg only\nto be demoted at once by Copernicus to the status of a marginal speck.\nDangling for centuries at the end of a chain of being, man’s lineality was\ninterrupted by Darwin whose lineality highlighted a missing segment in the\nsequence. Anyhow, Darwin broke up anthropocentric consciousness just as\nCopernicus had done for space. Yet till Freud, man somehow clung to some scrap\nof intuition of consciousness as tinged by spontaneity. But Freud ended that\nby his image of mind as ripple on the ocean of unconsciousness. Unless the\nWest had long been processed by print these metaphors would have carried no\ninterest whatever. Let us turn to a book by a mathematician, Sir Edmund\nWhittaker, which explains how some of this came to be. A passage of Kant’s\nfrom the _Critique of Practical Reason_ ([p. 14](ch02.html#page_14)) will\nusher us into this territory: “Since mathematics irrefutably proves the\ninfinite divisibility of space which empiricism cannot allow, there is an\nobvious contradiction between the highest possible demonstrable evidence and\nthe alleged inferences from empirical principles. … One might ask like\nCheseldren’s blind man, ‘Which deceives me, sight or touch?’ Empiricism is\nbased on touch, but rationalism on a necessity which can be seen.” Not only\ndid Kant not know that number is audile-tactile and infinitely repeatable, but\nthat the visual, in abstraction from the audile-tactile, sets up a world of\nantinomies and dichotomies of insoluble but irrelevant kind.\n\nSir Edmund Whittaker, in his _Space and Spirit_ ([p.\n121](ch02a.html#page_121)), explains in terms of the recent mathematics and\nphysics, the end of the Renaissance idea of continuous, uniform space that\ncame in with the notion of visual quantification:\n\nAt this point we escape from the order of the Newtonian cosmos. … In the\nargument as usually presented the language used is appropriate to the case\nwhen each effect has only one cause, and each cause has only one effect, so\nthat all chains of causation are simple linear sequences. If we now take into\naccount the fact that an effect may be produced by the joint action of several\ndistinct causes, and also that a cause may give rise to more than one effect,\nthe chains of causation may be branched, and also may have junctions with one\nanother; but since the rule still holds, that the cause always precedes the\neffect in time, it is evident that the proof is not essentially affected.\nMoreover, the argument does not require that all chains of causation, when\ntraced backward, should terminate on the _same_ ultimate point: in other\nwords, it does not lead necessarily to the conclusion that the universe\nacquired its entire stock-in-trade in a single consignment at the Creation,\nand that it has received nothing since. Thus it does not warrant the view, so\ncommon among the deistic Newtonians of the eighteenth century, that the system\nof the world is absolutely closed and has developed according to purely\nmechanical laws, so that all the events of history must have been implicit in\nits specification at the primeval instant. On the contrary, the recent trend\nof physical thought (as will be evident from what has been said about the\nprinciple of causality) is in favor of the view that in the physical domain,\nthere is a continual succession of intrusions or new creations. The universe\nis very far from being a mere mathematical consequence of the disposition of\nthe particles at the Creation, and is a much more interesting and eventful\nplace than any determinist imagines.\n\nThat passage explains the title and procedure of the present book, but is in\nno way necessary to the configurations with which we are dealing. Proneness to\nlook for mono-linear causation may explain why print culture has long been\nblind to most other kinds of causation. And it has been the consensus of\nmodern science and philosophy that we have now shifted from “cause” to\n“configuration” in all fields of study and analysis. This is why for a\nphysicist like Whittaker, it seems as unfortunate for St. Anselm in the early\nMiddle Ages to have tried to establish the existence of God by pure reason as\nfor Newton to have taken the opposite tack ([pp. 126](ch02a.html#page_126)–7):\n“Newton, though profoundly interested in theology, seems to have held that the\nphysicist can give his undivided attention to investigating the laws which\nwill enable him to predict phenomena, and can leave the deeper problems\nentirely out of account: he can make it his purpose to describe rather than to\nexplain.”\n\nThis was the Cartesian technique of separation that ensured that all the\nneglected aspects of experience would be rolled back into the unconscious.\nThis strategy, which grew from lineal specialism and separation of functions,\ncreated the world of dulness, bathos, and mock-profundity that Swift and Pope\nand Sterne made fun of. Newton was quite eligible as hero for _The Dunciad_\nand certainly got a place in _Gulliver’s Travels_.\n\nWe have seen how the alphabet involved the Greeks in a fictional “Euclidean\nSpace.” The effect of the phonetic alphabet in translating the audile-tactile\nworld into a visual world, was both in physics and in literature to create the\nfallacy of “content.” Whittaker writes thus ([p. 79](ch02.html#page_79)):\n“Aristotle regarded the _place_ of a body as being defined by the inner\nsurface of a body containing it: bodies which are not contained in other\nbodies are not in any place, and therefore the first or outermost heaven is\nnot in any place: space and time do not exist beyond it. He concluded that the\ntotal extent of the universe is finite.”\n\n### **The Gutenberg galaxy was theoretically dissolved in 1905 with the\ndiscovery of curved space, but in practice it had been invaded by the\ntelegraph two generations before that.**\n\nWhittaker notes ([p. 98](ch02.html#page_98)) that the space of Newton and\nGassendi was “so far as geometry was concerned, the space of Euclid: “it was\ninfinite, homogeneous, and completely featureless, one point being just like\nanother …” Much earlier our concern had been to explain why this fiction of\nhomogeneity and uniform continuity had derived from phonetic writing,\nespecially in print form. Whittaker says that from a physics point of view the\nNewtonian space was “mere emptiness into which things could be put.” But even\nfor Newton, the gravitational field seemed incompatible with this neutral\nspace. “As a matter of fact, the successors of Newton felt this difficulty;\nand, having started with a space that was in itself simply nonentity having no\nproperty except a capacity for being occupied, they proceeded to fill it\nseveral times over with ethers designed to provide electric, magnetic, and\ngravitational forces, and to account for the propagation of light.” ([pp.\n98](ch02.html#page_98)–9)\n\nPerhaps no more striking evidence of the merely visual and uniform character\nof the space was given than in the famous phrase of Pascal: “Le silence\néternel des espaces infinis m’effraie.” Some meditation on why silent space\nshould be so terrifying yields much insight into the cultural revolution going\non in human sensibilities by the visual stress of the printed book.\n\nBut the absurdity of speaking of space as a neutral container will never\ntrouble a culture which has separated its visual awareness from the other\nsenses. Yet, says Whittaker ([p. 100](ch02.html#page_100)) “in Einstein’s\nconception, space is no longer the stage on which the drama of physics is\nperformed: it is itself one of the performers; for gravitation, which is a\nphysical property, is entirely controlled by curvature, which is a geometrical\nproperty of space.”\n\nWith this recognition of curved space in 1905 the Gutenberg galaxy was\nofficially dissolved. With the end of lineal specialisms and fixed points of\nview, compartmentalized knowledge became as unacceptable as it had always been\nirrelevant. But the effect of such a segregated way of thinking has been to\nmake science a departmental affair, having no influence on eye and thought\nexcept indirectly through its applications. In recent years this isolationist\nattitude has weakened. And it has been the effort of this book to explain how\nthe illusion of segregation of knowledge had become possible by the isolation\nof the visual sense by means of alphabet and typography. Perhaps it cannot be\nsaid too often. This illusion may have been a good or a bad thing. But there\ncan only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects\ninherent in our own technologies.\n\nIn the later seventeenth century there is a considerable amount of alarm and\nrevulsion expressed concerning the growing quantity of printed books. The\nfirst hopes for a great reform of human manners by means of the book had met\ndisappointment, and in 1680 Leibnitz was writing:\n\nI fear we shall remain for a long time in our present confusion and indigence\nthrough our own fault. I even fear that after uselessly exhausting curiosity\nwithout obtaining from our investigations any considerable gain for our\nhappiness, people may be disgusted with the sciences, and that a fatal despair\nmay cause them to fall back into barbarism. To which result that horrible mass\nof books which keeps on growing might contribute very much. For in the end the\ndisorder will become nearly insurmountable; the indefinite multitude of\nauthors will shortly expose them all to the danger of general oblivion; the\nhope of glory animating many people at work in studies will suddenly cease; it\nwill be perhaps as disgraceful to be an author as it was formerly honorable.\nAt best, one may amuse himself with little books of the hour which will run\ntheir course in a few years and will serve to divert a reader from boredom for\na few moments, but which will have been written without any design to promote\nour knowledge or to deserve the appreciation of posterity. I shall be told\nthat since so many people write it is impossible for all their works to be\npreserved. I admit that, and I do not entirely disapprove those little books\nin fashion which are like the flowers of a springtime or like the fruits of an\nautumn, scarcely surviving a year. If they are well made, they have the effect\nof a useful conversation, not simply pleasing and keeping the idle out of\nmischief but helping to shape the mind and language. Often their aim is to\ninduce something good in men of our time, which is also the end I seek by\npublishing this little work …[110](ch02b_fn91.html#ch02b_fn91fn110)\n\nLeibnitz here envisages the book as the natural successor, as well as\nexecutioner, of scholastic philosophy, which might yet return. The book as a\nspur to fame and as the engine of immortality now seems to him in the utmost\ndanger from “the indefinite multitude of authors.” For the general run of\nbooks he sees the function of serving as a furtherer of conversation “keeping\nthe idle out of mischief” and “helping to shape the mind and language.” It is\nclear that the book was yet far from having become the main mode of politics\nand society. It was still a surface fact which had only begun to obscure the\ntraditional lineaments of Western society. With regard to the continuing\nthreat of scholastic renewal there is the ever-present literary or visual\ncomplaint about oral scholasticism that it is words, words, words. Leibnitz,\nwriting on the “Art of Discovery,” says:\n\nAmong the Scholastics there was a certain Jean Suisset called the Calculator,\nwhose works I have not yet been able to find and I have seen only those of a\nfew disciples of his. This Suisset began to use Mathematics in scholastic\narguments, but few people imitated him because they would have to give up the\nmethod of disputation for that of book-keeping and reasoning, and a stroke of\nthe pen would have spared much clamor.[111](ch02b_fn91.html#ch02b_fn91fn111)\n\n### **Pope’s**DUNCIAD** indicts the printed book as the agent of a\nprimitivistic and Romantic revival. Sheer\n\nvisual quantity evokes the magical resonance of the tribal horde. The box\noffice looms as a return to the echo chamber of bardic incantation.**\n\nIn 1683–84 there appeared in London by Joseph Moxon, _Mechanick Exercises on\nthe Whole Art of Printing_. The editors point out (p. vii) that “it put in\nwriting a knowledge that was wholly traditional,” and that Moxon’s book “was\nby forty years the earliest manual of printing in any language.” Like Gibbon\nin his retrospect of Rome, Moxon seems to have been animated by a sense of\nprint as having reached a terminus. A similar sentiment inspires _The Tale of\na Tub_ and _The Battle of the Books_ by Dean Swift. But it is to _The Dunciad_\nthat we must turn for the epic of the printed word and its benefits to\nmankind. For here is the explicit study of plunging of the human mind into the\nsludge of an unconscious engendered by the book. It has been obscured to\nposterity, in keeping with the prophecy at the end of Book IV, just why\nliterature should be charged with stupefying mankind, and mesmerically\nushering the polite world back into primitivism, the Africa within, and above\nall, the unconscious. The simple key to this operation is that which we have\nhad in hand throughout this book – the increasing separation of the visual\nfaculty from the interplay with the other senses leads to the rejection from\nconsciousness of most of our experience, and the consequent hypertrophy of the\nunconscious. This ever-enlarging domain Pope calls the world “of Chaos and old\nNight.” It is the tribal, non-literate world celebrated by Mircea Eliade in\n_The Sacred and the Profane_.\n\nMartinus Scriblerus in his notes to _The Dunciad_ reflects on how much more\ndifficult it is to write an epic about the numerous scribblers and industrious\nhacks of the press than about a Charlemagne, a Brute, or a Godfrey. He then\nmentions the need for a satirist “to dissuade the dull and punish the wicked,”\nand looks at the general situation that has brought on the crisis:\n\nWe shall next declare the occasion and the cause which moved our Poet to this\nparticular work. He lived in those days when (after providence had permitted\nthe Invention of Printing as a scourge for the Sins of the learned) Paper also\nbecame so cheap, and printers so numerous, that a deluge of authors cover’d\nthe land: Whereby not only the peace of the honest unwriting subject was daily\nmolested, but unmerciful demands were made of his applause, yea of his money,\nby such as would neither earn the one, or deserve the other; At the same time,\nthe Liberty of the Press was so unlimited, that it grew dangerous to refuse\nthem either: For they would forthwith publish slanders unpunish’d, the authors\nbeing anonymous; nay the immediate publishers thereof lay sculking under the\nwings of an Act of Parliament, assuredly intended for better\npurposes.[112](ch02b_fn92.html#ch02b_fn92fn112)\n\nNext he turns ([p. 50](ch02.html#page_50)) from the general economic causes to\nthe private moral motivation of authors inspired by “Dulness and Poverty; the\none born with them, the other contracted by neglect of their proper talents …”\nIn a word, the attack is on applied knowledge as it manifests itself in\n“Industry” and “Plodding.” For authors inspired by self-opinion and the\ncraving for self-expression are driven into “setting up this sad and sorry\nmerchandise.”\n\nBy means of the agglomerate action of many such victims of applied knowledge –\nthat is, self-opinionated authors endowed with Industry and Plodding – there\nis now the restoration of the reign of Chaos and old Night and the removal of\nthe imperial seat of Dulness their daughter from the City to the Polite\nworld.” As the book market expands, the division between intellect and\ncommerce ends. The book trade takes over the functions of wit and spirit and\ngovernment.\n\nThat is the meaning of the opening lines of the first editions of the poem:\n\nBooks and the man I sing, the first who brings  \nThe Smithfield Muses to the ears of Kings.\n\nIt seemed quite unnatural to the “polite world” of the time that decision-\nmaking and kingly rule should be accessible to popular authors. We no longer\nconsider it odd or revolting to be ruled by people for whom the book of the\nmonth might appear quite respectable fare. Smithfield, where Bartholomew Fair\nwas kept, was still a place for book-peddling. But in later editions Pope\nchanged the opening:\n\nThe mighty Mother, and her Son, who brings  \nThe Smithfield Muses to the ear of Kings.\n\nHe has encountered the public, the collective unconscious, and dubbed it “the\nmighty Mother,” in accordance with the occultism of his time. It is Joyce’s\n“Lead kindly Fowl” (foule, owl, crowd), which we have seen earlier.\n\nAs the book market enlarged and the gathering and reporting of news improved,\nthe nature of authorship and public underwent the great changes that we accept\nas normal today. The book had retained from manuscript times some of its\nprivate and conversational character, as Leibnitz indicated in his evaluation.\nBut the book was beginning to be merged in the newspaper as the work of\nAddison and Steele reminds us. Improved printing technology carried this\nprocess all the way by the end of the eighteenth century and the arrival of\nthe steam press.\n\nYet Dudek in _Literature and the Press_ ([p. 46](ch02.html#page_46)) considers\nthat even after steampower had been applied to printing:\n\nEnglish newspapers in the first quarter of the century, however, were by no\nmeans designed to appeal to the whole population. By modern standards they\nwould be considered too dull to interest more than a small minority of serious\nreaders. … Early nineteenth century newspapers were run largely for the\ngenteel. Their style was stiff and formal, ranging between Addisonian\ngracefulness and Johnsonian elevation. The contents consisted of small\nadvertisements, of local affairs and national politics, especially of\ncommercial news and long transcriptions of parliamentary reports. … the best\ncurrent literature was noticed in the newspapers. … “In those days,” Charles\nLamb recalled, “every morning paper, as an essential retainer to its\nestablishment, kept an author, who was bound to furnish daily a quantum of\nwitty paragraphs. …” And since the divorce between the language of journalism\n(journalese) and the literary use of language had not yet been brought about,\nwe find in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century that some of the\nprincipal men of letters contributed to the newspapers or made a living by\nwriting.\n\nBut Pope peopled his _Dunciad_ with these very figures, for his perceptions\nand criticisms were not personal or based on a private point of view. Rather\nhe was concerned with a total change. It is significant that this change is\nnot specified until the fourth book of _The Dunciad_ , which came out in 1742.\nIt is after introducing the famous classics master, Dr. Busby of Westminster\nschool, that we hear the ancient and especially Ciceronian theme concerning\nthe excellence of man (IV, ll. 147–50):\n\nThe pale Boy-Senator yet tingling stands,  \nAnd holds his breeches close with both his hands.  \nThen thus. “Since Man from beast by Words is known,  \nWords are Man’s province, Words we teach alone.”\n\nEarlier we had noted the meaning of this theme for Cicero who regarded\neloquence as an inclusive wisdom harmonizing our faculties, unifying all\nknowledge. Pope is here quite explicit in citing the destruction of this unity\nas deriving from word specialism and denudation. The theme of the denudation\nof consciousness we have followed continuously throughout the Renaissance. It\nis also the theme of Pope’s _Dunciad_. The Boy-Senator continues:\n\nWhen Reason doubtful, like the Samian letter,  \nPoints him two ways, the narrower is the better.  \nPlac’d at the door of Learning, youth to guide,  \nWe never suffer it to stand too wide.  \nTo ask, to guess, to know, as they commence,  \nAs Fancy opens the quick springs of Sense,  \nWe ply the Memory, we load the brain,  \nBind rebel Wit, and double chain on chain,  \nConfine the thought, to exercise the breath;  \nAnd keep them in the pale of Words till death.  \nWhate’er the talents, or howe’er design’d,  \nWe hang one jingling padlock on the mind:  \nA Poet the first day, he dips his quill;  \nAnd what the last? a very Poet still.  \nPity! the charm works only in our wall,  \nLost, lost too soon in yonder House or Hall.\n\nPope has not received his due as a serious analyst of the intellectual\n_malaise_ of Europe. He continues Shakespeare’s argument in _Lear_ and Donne’s\nin the _Anatomy of the World_:\n\n’Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone,  \nAll just supply and all relation.\n\nIt is the division of sense and the separation of words from their functions\nthat Pope decries exactly as does Shakespeare in _King Lear_. Art and science\nhad been separated as visual quantification and homogenization penetrated to\nevery domain and the mechanization of language and literature proceeded:\n\nBeneath her foot-stool _Science_ groans in Chains,  \nAnd Wit dreads Exile, Penalties and Pains.  \nThere foam’d rebellious _Logic_ gagg’d and bound,  \nThere, stript fair _Rhet’ric_ languish’d on the\nground;[113](ch02b_fn93.html#ch02b_fn93fn113)\n\n### **The new collective unconscious Pope saw as the accumulating backwash of\nprivate self-expression.**\n\nPope had a very simple scheme for his first three books. Book I deals with\nauthors, their egotism and desire for self-expression and eternal fame. Book\nII turns to the book sellers who provide the conduits to swell the tides of\npublic confession. Book III concerns the collective unconscious, the growing\nbackwash from the tidal wave of self-expression. It is Pope’s simple theme\nthat the fogs of Dulness and new tribalism are fed by the printing press. Wit,\nthe quick interplay among our senses and faculties, is thus steadily\nanesthetized by the encroaching unconscious. Anybody who tried to get Pope’s\nmeaning by considering the content of the writers he presents would miss the\nneeded clues. Pope is offering a formal causality, not an efficient causality,\nas an explanation of the metamorphosis from within. The entire matter is thus\nto be found in a single couplet (I, ll. 89–90):\n\nNow night descending, the proud scene was o’er,  \nBut liv’d, in Settle’s numbers, one day more.\n\nPrint, with its uniformity, repeatability, and limitless extent, does give\nreincarnate life and fame to anything at all. The kind of limp life so\nconferred by dull heads upon dull themes formalistically penetrates all\nexistence. Since readers are as vain as authors, they crave to view their own\nconglomerate visage and, therefore, demand the dullest wits to exert\nthemselves in ever greater degree as the collective audience increases. The\n“human interest” newspaper is the ultimate mode of this collective dynamic:\n\nNow May’rs and Shrieves all hush’d and satiate lay,  \nYet eat, in dreams, the custard of the day;  \nWhile pensive Poets painful vigils keep,  \nSleepless themselves to give their readers\nsleep.[114](ch02b_fn94.html#ch02b_fn94fn114)\n\nOf course, Pope does not mean that the readers will be bored by the products\nof sleepless poets or news writers. Quite the contrary. They will be thrilled,\nas by seeing their own image in the press. The readers’ sleep is of the\nspirit. In their wits they are not pained but impaired.\n\nPope is telling the English world what Cervantes had told the Spanish world\nand Rabelais the French world concerning print. It is a delirium. It is a\ntransforming and metamorphosing drug that has the power of imposing its\nassumptions upon every level of consciousness. But for us in the 1960’s, print\nhas much of the quaint receding character of the movie and the railway train.\nIn recognizing its hidden powers at this late date we can learn to stress the\npositive virtues of print but we can gain insight into the much more potent\nand recent forms of radio and television also.\n\nIn his analysis of books, authors, and markets, Pope, like Harold Innis in\n_The Bias of Communication_ , assumes that the entire operation of print in\nour lives is not only unconscious but that for this very reason it\nimmeasurably enlarges the domain of the unconscious. Pope placed an owl at the\nbeginning of _The Dunciad_ , and Innis entitled the opening chapter of _The\nBias of Communication_ , “Minerva’s Owl”: “Minerva’s Owl begins its flight\nonly in the gathering dusk …”\n\nAubrey Williams has a fine treatment[115](ch02b_fn95.html#ch02b_fn95fn115) of\nthe second _Dunciad_ of 1729 in which he quotes Pope’s own words to Swift:\n\nThe Dunciad is going to be printed in all pomp. … It will be attended with\n_Proeme_ , _Prolegomena_ , _Testimonia Scriptorum_ , _Index Authorum_ , and\nNotes _Variorum_. As to the latter, I desire you to read over the text, and\nmake a few in any way you like best, whether dry raillery, upon the style and\nway of commenting of trivial critics; or humorous, upon the authors in the\npoem; or historical, of persons, places, times; or explanatory; or collecting\nthe parallel passages of the ancients.\n\nInstead, that is, of a mere individual book attack on Dulness, Pope has\nprovided a collective newspaper format and much “human interest” for the poem.\nHe can thus render the plodding industry of Baconian applied knowledge and\ngroup toil with a dramatic quality that renders, yet irradiates, the very\nDulness he decries. Williams points out ([p. 60](ch02.html#page_60)) that the\nreason why “the new material attached to the poem has never been adequately\ndefined is due, I think, to the assumptions most critics and editors have\nmade: that the notes are to be taken at the level of history, and that their\nmain purpose is to continue the personal satire in a prose commentary.”\n\n### **The last book of THE DUNCIAD proclaims the metamorphic power of\nmechanically applied knowledge as a stupendous parody of the Eucharist.**\n\nThe entire fourth book of _The Dunciad_ has to do with the theme of _The\nGutenberg Galaxy_, the translation or reduction of diverse modes into a single\nmode of homogenized things. Right off, (ll. 44–5) this theme is rendered in\nterms of the new Italian opera.\n\nWhen lo’ a Harlot form soft sliding by,  \nWith mincing step, small voice, and languid eye;\n\nIn the new chromatics, Pope finds (ll. 57–60) the all-reducing and\nhomogenizing power that the book exercises on the human spirit:\n\nOne Trill shall harmonize joy, grief, and rage,  \nWake the dull Church, and lull the ranting Stage;  \nTo the same notes thy sons shall hum, or snore,  \nAnd all thy yawning daughters cry, _encore_.\n\nReduction and metamorphosis by homogenization and fragmentation are the\npersistent themes of the fourth book (ll. 453–6):\n\nO! would the Sons of Men once think their Eyes  \nAnd Reason giv’n them but to study _Flies_!  \nSee Nature in some partial narrow shape,  \nAnd let the Author of the Whole escape:\n\nBut these were the means by which, as Yeats tells us:\n\nLocke sank into a swoon;  \nThe Garden died;  \nGod took the spinning jenny  \nOut of his side.\n\nThe popular mesmerism achieved by uniformity and repeatability, taught men the\nmiracles of the division of labour and the creation of world markets. It is\nthese miracles that Pope anticipates in _The Dunciad_ , for their transforming\npower had long affected the mind. The mind now afflicted with the desire and\npower to climb by sheer sequential additive toil:\n\nWhy all your Toils? Your Sons have learn’d to sing.  \nHow quick Ambition hastes to ridicule!  \nThe Sire is made a Peer, the Son a Fool.\n\nThen follows a decisive passage of explicit comment (ll. 549–57) on the\nGutenberg miracles of applied knowledge and human transformation:\n\nOn some, a Priest succinct in amice white  \nAttends; all flesh is nothing in his sight!  \nBeeves, at his touch, at once to jelly turn,  \nAnd the huge Boar is shrunk into an Urn:  \nThe board with specious miracles he loads,  \nTurns Hares to Larks, and Pigeons into Toads.  \nAnother (for in all what one can shine?)  \nExplains the _Seve_ and _Verdeur_ of the Vine.  \nWhat cannot copious Sacrifice attone?\n\nPope deliberately makes the miracles of applied knowledge a parody of the\nEucharist. It is the same transforming and reducing power of applied knowledge\nwhich has confounded and confused all the arts and sciences, for, says Pope,\nthe new _translatio studii_ or transmission of studies and disciplines by the\nprinted book has not been so much a transmission as a complete transformation\nof the disciplines and of the human mind as well. Studies have been translated\nexactly as was Bottom the Weaver.\n\nHow closely Pope’s progress of Dulness over the earth conforms to the concept\nof _translatio studii_ can be seen easily if lines 65–112 of Dunciad III are\ncompared to this statement of the historic theme by an English humanist of the\nfourteenth century, Richard de Bury: “Admirable Minerva seems to bend her\ncourse to all the nations of the earth, and reacheth from end to end mightily,\nthat she may reveal herself to all mankind. We see that she has already\nvisited the Indians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians and Greeks, the Arabs and\nthe Romans. Now she has passed by Paris, and now has happily come to Britain,\nthe most noble of islands, nay, rather a microcosm in itself, that she may\nshow herself a debtor both to the Greeks and to the\nBarbarians.”[116](ch02b_fn96.html#ch02b_fn96fn116)\n\nAnd Pope in making Dulness the goddess of the unconscious is contrasting her\nwith Minerva, goddess of alert intellect and wit. It is not Minerva but her\nobverse complement, the owl, that the printed book has conferred on Western\nman. “However ill-fitting their heroic garb,” Williams remarks ([p.\n59](ch02.html#page_59)), “one at last finds the dunces invested with\nuncivilizing powers of epic proportions.”\n\nSupported by the Gutenberg technology, the power of the dunces to shape and\nbefog the human intellect is unlimited. Pope’s efforts to clarify this basic\npoint have been in vain. His intense concern with the _pattern_ of action in\nhis armed horde of nobodies has been mistaken for personal spite. Pope was\nentirely concerned with the _formalistic pattern_ and penetrative and\nconfiguring power of the new technology. His readers have been befogged by\n“content” obsession and the practical benefits of applied knowledge. He says\nin a note to Book III, l. 337:\n\nDo not gentle reader, rest too secure in thy contempt of the Instruments for\nsuch a revolution in learning, or despise such weak agents as have been\ndescribed in our poem, but remember what the _Dutch_ stories somewhere relate,\nthat a great part of their Provinces was once overflow’d, by a small opening\nmade in one of their dykes by a single _Water-Rat_.\n\nBut the new mechanical instrument and its mesmerized and homogenized servants,\nthe dunces, are irresistible:\n\nIn vain, in vain, – The all-composing Hour  \nResistless falls: The Muse obeys the Pow’r.  \nShe comes! she comes! the sable Throne behold  \nOf _Night_ Primaeval, and of _Chaos_ old!  \nBefore her, _Fancy’s_ gilded clouds decay,  \nAnd all its varying Rain-bows die away.  \n_Wit_ shoots in vain its momentary fires,  \nThe meteor drops, and in a flash expires.  \nAs one by one, at dread Medea’s strain,  \nThe sick’ning stars fade off th’ethereal plain;  \nAs Argus’ eyes by Hermes’ wand opprest,  \nClos’d one by one to everlasting rest;  \nThus at her felt approach, and secret might,  \n_Art_ after _Art_ goes out, and all is Night.  \nSee skulking _Truth_ to her old Cavern fled,  \nMountains of Casuistry heap’d o’er her head!  \n_Philosophy_ , that lean’d on Heav’n before,  \nShrinks to her second cause, and is no more.  \n_Physic_ of _Metaphysic_ begs defence,  \nAnd _Metaphysic_ calls for aid on _Sense_!  \nSee _Mystery_ to _Mathematics_ fly!  \nIn vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.  \n_Religion_ blushing veils her sacred fires,  \nAnd unawares _Morality_ expires.  \nNor _public_ Flame, nor _private_ , dares to shine;  \nNor _human_ Spark is left, nor Glimpse _divine_!  \nLo! thy dread Empire, CHAOS! is restor’d;  \nLight dies before thy uncreating word:  \nThy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall;  \nAnd Universal Darkness buries All.[117](ch02b_fn97.html#ch02b_fn97fn117)\n\nThis is the Night from which Joyce invites the Finnegans to wake.\n\n\n## THE GALAXY RECONFIGURED or the Plight of Mass Man in an Individualist\nSociety\n\nThe present volume has employed a mosaic pattern of perception and observation\nup till now. William Blake can provide the explanation and justification of\nthis procedure. _Jerusalem_ , like so much of his other poetry, is concerned\nwith the changing patterns of human perception. Book II, chapter 34, of the\npoem contains the pervasive theme:\n\nIf Perceptive organs vary, Objects of Perception\n\nseem to vary:\n\nIf the Perceptive Organs close, their Objects seem to\n\nclose also.\n\nDetermined as he was to explain the causes and effects of psychic change, both\npersonal and social, he arrived long ago at the theme of _The Gutenberg\nGalaxy_ :\n\nThe Seven Nations fled before him: they became what  \nthey beheld.\n\nBlake makes quite explicit that when sense ratios change, men change. Sense\nratios change when any one sense or bodily or mental function is externalized\nin technological form:\n\nThe Spectre is the Reasoning Power in Man, & when separated  \nFrom Imagination and closing itself as in steel in a Ratio  \nOf the Things of Memory, It thence frames Laws & Moralities  \nTo destroy Imagination, the Divine Body, by Martyrdoms &\nWars.[1](ch03_fn01.html#ch03_fn01fn1)\n\nImagination is that ratio among the perceptions and faculties which exists\nwhen they are not embedded or outered in material technologies. When so\noutered, each sense and faculty becomes a closed system. Prior to such\noutering there is entire interplay among experiences. This interplay or\nsynesthesia is a kind of tactility such as Blake sought in the bounding line\nof sculptural form and in engraving.\n\nWhen the perverse ingenuity of man has outered some part of his being in\nmaterial technology, his entire sense ratio is altered. He is then compelled\nto behold this fragment of himself “closing itself as in steel.” In beholding\nthis new thing, man is compelled to become it. Such was the origin of lineal,\nfragmented analysis with its remorseless power of homogenization:\n\nThe Reasoning Spectre  \nStands between the Vegetative Man & his Immortal\nImagination.[2](ch03_fn02.html#ch03_fn02fn2)\n\nBlake’s diagnosis of the problem of his age was, like Pope’s in _The Dunciad_\n, a direct confrontation of the forces shaping human perception. That he\nsought mythical form by which to render his vision was both necessary and\nineffectual. For myth is the mode of simultaneous awareness of a complex group\nof causes and effects. In an age of fragmented, lineal awareness, such as\nproduced and was in turn greatly exaggerated by Gutenberg technology,\nmythological vision remains quite opaque. The Romantic poets fell far short of\nBlake’s mythical or simultaneous vision. They were faithful to Newton’s single\nvision and perfected the picturesque outer landscape as a means of isolating\nsingle states of the inner life.[3](ch03_fn02.html#ch03_fn02fn3)\n\nIt is instructive for the history of human sensibility to note how the popular\nvogue of the Gothic romance in Blake’s time later unfolded into a serious\nesthetic with Ruskin and the French symbolists. This Gothic taste, trite and\nridiculous as it first appeared to serious people, was yet a confirmation of\nBlake’s diagnosis of the defects and needs of his age. It was itself a pre-\nRaphael or pre-Gutenberg quest for a unified mode of perception. In _Modern\nPainters_ (vol. III, [p. 91](ch02.html#page_91)) Ruskin states the matter in a\nway which entirely dissociates Gothic medievalism from any historical concern\nabout the Middle Ages. He states the matter in a way that won him the serious\ninterest of Rimbaud and Proust:\n\nA fine grotesque is the expression, in a moment, by a series of symbols thrown\ntogether in bold and fearless connection, of truths which it would have taken\na long time to express in any verbal way, and of which the connection is left\nfor the beholder to work out for himself; the gaps, left or overleaped by the\nhaste of the imagination, forming the grotesque character.\n\nFor Ruskin, Gothic appeared as an indispensable means of breaking open the\nclosed system of perception that Blake spent his life describing and fighting.\nRuskin proceeds ([p. 96](ch02.html#page_96)) to explain Gothic grotesque as\nthe best way of ending the regime of Renaissance perspective and single vision\nor realism:\n\nIt is with a view (not the least important among many others bearing upon art)\nto the reopening of this great field of human intelligence, long entirely\nclosed, that I am striving to introduce Gothic architecture into daily\ndomestic use; and to revive the art of illumination, properly so called; not\nthe art of miniature-painting in books, or on vellum, which has ridiculously\nbeen confused with it; but of making _writing_ , simple writing, beautiful to\nthe eye, by investing it with the great chord of perfect colour, blue, purple,\nscarlet, white, and gold, and in that chord of colour, permitting the\ncontinual play of the fancy of the writer in every species of grotesque\nimagination, carefully excluding shadow; the distinctive difference between\nillumination and painting proper, being, that illumination admits _no_\nshadows, but only gradations of pure colour.\n\nThe student of Rimbaud will find that it was while reading this part of Ruskin\nthat Rimbaud found his title for _Illuminations_. The technique of vision in\nthe _Illuminations_ or “painted slides,” (as Rimbaud called them, in English,\non his title page) is exactly as Ruskin delineates the grotesque. But even\nJoyce’s _Ulysses_ finds anticipatory designation in the same context:\n\nHence it is an infinite good to mankind when there is full acceptance of the\ngrotesque, slightly sketched or expressed; and, if field for such expression\nbe frankly granted, an enormous mass of intellectual power is turned to\neverlasting use, which, in this present century of ours, evaporates in street\ngibing or vain revelling; all the good wit and satire expiring in daily talk,\n(like foam on wine,) which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had a\npermitted and useful expression in the arts of sculpture and illumination,\nlike foam fixed into chalcedony.[4](ch03_fn03.html#ch03_fn03fn4)\n\nJoyce, that is to say, also accepted the grotesque as a mode of broken or\nsyncopated manipulation to permit _inclusive_ or simultaneous perception of a\ntotal and diversified field. Such, indeed, is symbolism by definition – a\ncollocation, a _parataxis_ of components representing insight by carefully\nestablished ratios, but without a point of view or lineal connection or\nsequential order.\n\nNothing, therefore, could be more remote from Joyce’s ratios than the aim of\npictorial realism. Indeed, he uses such realism and such Gutenberg technology\nas part of his symbolism. For example, in the seventh or Aeolus episode of\n_Ulysses_ the technology of the newspaper is made the occasion for introducing\nall of the nine hundred and more rhetorical figures specified by Quintilian in\nhis _Institutes of Oratory._ The figures of classical rhetoric are archetypes\nor postures of individual minds. Joyce by means of the modern press translates\nthem into archetypes or postures of collective consciousness. He breaks open\nthe closed system of classical rhetoric at the same time that he cuts into the\nclosed system of newspaper somnambulism. Symbolism is a kind of witty jazz, a\nconsummation of Ruskin’s aspirations for the grotesque that would have shocked\nhim a good deal. But it proved to be the only way out of “single vision and\nNewton’s sleep.”\n\nBlake had the insights but not the technical resources for rendering his\nvision. Paradoxically, it was not through the book but through the development\nof the mass press, especially the telegraph press, that poets found the\nartistic keys to the world of simultaneity, or of modern myth. It was in the\nformat of the daily press that Rimbaud and Mallarmé discovered the means of\nrendering the interplay of all the functions of what Coleridge called the\n“esemplastic” imagination.[5](ch03_fn03.html#ch03_fn03fn5) For the popular\npress offers no single vision, no point of view, but a mosaic of the postures\nof the collective consciousness, as Mallarmé proclaimed. Yet these modes of\ncollective or tribal consciousness proliferating in the telegraphic\n(simultaneous) press, remain uncongenial and opaque to the bookmen locked in\n“single vision and Newton’s sleep.”\n\nThe principal ideas of the eighteenth century were so crude as to seem risible\nto the wits of the time. The great chain of Being was in its way as comical as\nthe chains which Rousseau proclaimed in his _Social Contract_. Equally\ninadequate as an idea of order was the merely visual notion of goodness as a\n_plenum_ : “The best of all possible worlds” was merely a quantitative idea of\na bag crammed to the utmost with goodies – an idea which lurked still in the\nnursery world of R. L. Stevenson. (“The world is so full of a number of\nthings.”) But in J. S. Mill’s _Liberty_ the quantitative idea of truth as an\nideal container packed with every possible opinion and point of view created\nmental anguish. For the suppression of any possible aspect of truth, any valid\nangle, might weaken the whole structure. In fact, the stress on the abstract\nvisual evoked as standards of truth the mere matching of object with object.\nSo unconscious were people of this matching theory as being dominant, that\nwhen a Pope or a Blake pointed out that truth is a ratio between the mind and\nthings, a ratio made by the shaping imagination, there was nobody to note or\ncomprehend. Mechanical matching, not imaginative making, will rule in the arts\nand sciences, in politics and education, until our own time.\n\nEarlier, in presenting Pope’s prophetic vision of the return of tribal or\ncollective consciousness, the relation to Joyce’s _Finnegans Wake_ had been\nindicated. Joyce had devised for Western man individual pass-keys to the\ncollective consciousness, as he declared on the last page of the _Wake._ He\nknew that he had solved the dilemma of Western individual man faced with the\ncollective or tribal consequences of first his Gutenberg, and next his\nMarconi, technologies. Pope had seen the tribal consciousness latent in the\nnew mass culture of the book-trade. Language and the arts would cease to be\nprime agents of critical perception and become mere packaging devices for\nreleasing a spate of verbal commodities. Blake and the Romantics and the\nVictorians alike became obsessed with the actualization of Pope’s vision in\nthe new organization of an industrial economy embedded in a self-regulating\nsystem of land, labour, and capital. The Newtonian laws of mechanics, latent\nin Gutenberg typography, were translated by Adam Smith to govern the laws of\nproduction and consumption. In accordance with Pope’s prediction of automatic\ntrance or “robo-centrism,” Smith declared that the mechanical laws of the\neconomy applied equally to the things of the mind: “In opulent and commercial\nsocieties to think or to reason comes to be, like every other employment, a\nparticular business, which is carried on by a very few people, who furnish the\npublic with all the thought and reason possessed by the vast multitudes that\nlabour.”[6](ch03_fn04.html#ch03_fn04fn6)\n\nAdam Smith is always faithful to the fixed visual point of view and its\nconsequent separation of faculties and functions. But in this passage Smith\ndoes seem to sense that the new role of the intellectual is to tap the\ncollective consciousness of “the vast multitudes that labour.” That is to say,\nthe intellectual is no longer to direct individual perception and judgment but\nto explore and to communicate the massive unconsciousness of collective man.\nThe intellectual is newly cast in the role of a primitive seer, _vates_ , or\nhero incongruously peddling his discoveries in a commercial market. If Adam\nSmith was reluctant to push his view to this point of the transcendental\nimagination, Blake and the Romantics felt no qualms but turned literature over\nto the transcendental arm. Henceforth, literature will be at war with itself\nand with the social mechanics of conscious goals and motivations. For the\nmatter of literary vision will be collective and mythic, while the forms of\nliterary expression and communication will be individualist, segmental, and\nmechanical. The vision will be tribal and collective, the expression private\nand marketable. This dilemma continues to the present to rend the individual\nWestern consciousness. Western man knows that his values and modalities are\nthe product of literacy. Yet the very means of extending those values,\ntechnologically, seem to deny and reverse them. Whereas Pope fully faced up to\nthis dilemma in _The Dunciad_ , Blake and the Romantics tended to devote\nthemselves to one side of it, the mythic and collective. J. S. Mill, Matthew\nArnold, and a great many others devoted themselves to the other side of the\ndilemma, the problem of individual culture and liberty in an age of mass-\nculture. But neither side has its meaning alone, nor can the causes of the\ndilemma be found anywhere but in the total galaxy of events that constitute\nliteracy and Gutenberg technology. Our liberation from the dilemma may, as\nJoyce felt, come from the new electric technology, with its profound organic\ncharacter. For the electric puts the mythic or collective dimension of human\nexperience fully into the conscious wake-a-day world. Such is the meaning of\nthe title _Finnegans Wake_. While the old Finn cycles had been tribally\nentranced in the collective night of the unconscious, the new Finn cycle of\ntotally interdependent man must be lived in the daylight of consciousness.\n\nAt this point, _The Great Transformation_ by Karl Polanyi, on “the political\nand economic origins of our time,” assumes complete relevance in the mosaic of\n_The Gutenberg Galaxy_. Polanyi is concerned with the stages by which the\nNewtonian mechanics invaded and transformed society in the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, only to encounter a reverse dynamic from within. His\nanalysis of how prior to the eighteenth century “the economic system was\nabsorbed in the social system” is exactly parallel to the situation of\nliterature and the arts up till that time. This was true till the time of\nDryden, Pope, and Swift, who lived to detect the great transformation. Polanyi\nenables us ([p. 68](ch02.html#page_68)) to face the familiar Gutenberg\nprinciple of practical advance and utility by separation of forms and\nfunctions:\n\nAs a rule, the economic system was absorbed in the social system, and whatever\nprinciple of behavior predominated in the economy, the presence of the market\npattern was found to be compatible with it. The principle of barter or\nexchange, which underlies this pattern, revealed no tendency to expand at the\nexpense of the rest. Where markets were most highly developed, as under the\nmercantile system, they throve under the control of a centralized\nadministration which fostered autarchy both in the households of the peasantry\nand in respect to national life. Regulation and markets, in effect, grew up\ntogether. The self-regulating market was unknown; indeed the emergence of the\nidea of self-regulation was a complete reversal of the trend of development.\n\nThe principle of self-regulation repeating by reverberation from the Newtonian\nsphere swiftly entered all the social spheres. It is the principle that Pope\nmocked in “whatever is is right” and that Swift ridiculed in “the mechanickal\noperation of the Spirit.” It derives from a merely vision image of an\nuninterrupted chain of Being or a visual _plenum_ of the good as “the best of\nall possible worlds.” Granted the merely visual assumptions of lineal\ncontinuity or of sequential dependence, the principle of non-interference in\nthe natural order becomes the paradoxical conclusion of applied knowledge.\n\nThrough the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the transformation of\nmechanization of crafts by the application of visual _method_ had proceeded\nslowly. But it was a procedure of maximal interference with existing non-\nvisual modes. By the eighteenth century the process of applied knowledge had\nreached such a momentum that it became accepted as a natural process which\nmust not be impeded save at the peril of greater evil: “all partial evil\nuniversal good.” Polanyi notes ([p. 69](ch02.html#page_69)) this automation of\nconsciousness as follows:\n\nA further group of assumptions follows in respect to the state and its policy.\nNothing must be allowed to inhibit the formation of markets, nor must incomes\nbe permitted to be formed otherwise than through sales. Neither must there be\nany interference with the adjustment of prices to changed market conditions –\nwhether the prices are those of goods, labor, land, or money. Hence there must\nnot only be markets for all elements of industry, but no measure of policy\nmust be countenanced that would influence the action of these markets. Neither\nprice, nor supply, nor demand must be fixed or regulated; only such policies\nand measures are in order which help to ensure the self-regulation of the\nmarket by creating conditions which make the market the only organizing power\nin the economic sphere.\n\nThe assumptions latent in typographic segmentation, and in applied knowledge\nby the method of fragmenting of crafts and the specializing of social tasks,\nthese assumptions were the more acceptable in the degree that typography\nenlarged its markets. The same assumptions presided over the formation of\nNewtonian space and time and mechanics. So literature, industry, and economics\nwere easily accommodated within the Newtonian sphere. Those who questioned\nthese assumptions were simply denying the facts of science. Now that Newton is\nno longer synonymous with science, we can meditate on the dilemmas of the\nself-regulating economy and the hedonistic calculus with light hearts and\nclear heads. But eighteenth century man was locked into a closed visual system\nthat had enveloped him he knew not how. So he proceeded, robo-centred, to\ncarry out the behests of the new vision.\n\nHowever, in 1709 Bishop Berkeley had published _A New Theory of Vision_ ,\nwhich revealed the lop-sided assumptions of Newtonian optics. Blake, at least,\nhad understood the Berkeleyan critique and had restored tactility to its prime\nrole as agent of unified perception. Today artists and scientists alike concur\nin praising Berkeley. But his wisdom was lost on his age that was wrapped in\n“single vision and Newton’s sleep.” The hypnotized patient carried out the\nbehests of the abstract visual control. Polanyi observes ([p.\n71](ch02.html#page_71)):\n\nA self-regulating market demands nothing less than the institutional\nseparation of society into an economic and political sphere. Such a dichotomy\nis, in effect, merely the restatement, from the point of view of society as a\nwhole, of the existence of a self-regulating market. It might be argued that\nthe separateness of the two spheres obtains in every type of society at all\ntimes. Such an inference, however, would be based on a fallacy. True, no\nsociety can exist without a system of some kind which ensures order in the\nproduction and distribution of goods. But that does not imply the existence of\nseparate economic institutions; normally, the economic order is merely a\nfunction of the social, in which it is contained. Neither under tribal, nor\nfeudal, nor mercantile conditions was there, as we have shown, a separate\neconomic system in society. Nineteenth century society, in which economic\nactivity was isolated and imputed to a distinctive economic motive, was,\nindeed, a singular departure.\n\nSuch an institutional pattern could not function unless society was somehow\nsubordinated to its requirements. A market economy can exist only in a market\nsociety. We reached this conclusion on general grounds in our analysis of the\nmarket pattern. We can now specify the reasons for this assertion. A market\neconomy must comprise all elements of industry, including labor, land, and\nmoney. (In a market economy the last also is an essential element of\nindustrial life and its inclusion in the market mechanism has, as we will see,\nfar-reaching institutional consequences.) But labor and land are no other than\nthe human beings themselves of which every society consists and the natural\nsurroundings in which it exists. To include them in the market mechanism means\nto subordinate the substance of society itself to the laws of the market.\n\nA market economy “can exist only in a market society.” But to exist, a market\nsociety requires centuries of transformation by Gutenberg technology; hence,\nthe absurdity in the present time of trying to institute market economies in\ncountries like Russia or Hungary, where feudal conditions obtained until the\ntwentieth century. It is possible to set up modern production in such areas,\nbut to create a market economy that can handle what comes off the assembly\nlines presupposes a long period of psychic transformation, which is to say, a\nperiod of altering perception and sense ratios.\n\nWhen a society is enclosed within a particular fixed sense ratio, it is quite\nunable to envisage another state of affairs. Thus, the advent of nationalism\nwas quite unforeseen in the Renaissance, although its causes arrived earlier.\nThe Industrial Revolution was well on the way in 1795, yet, as Polanyi points\nout ([p. 89](ch02.html#page_89)):\n\n. . . the generation of Speenhamland was unconscious of what was on its way.\nOn the eve of the greatest industrial revolution in history, no signs and\nportents were forthcoming. Capitalism arrived unannounced. No one had forecast\nthe development of a machine industry; it came as a complete surprise. For\nsome time England had been actually expecting a permanent recession of foreign\ntrade when the dam burst, and the old world was swept away in one indomitable\nsurge towards a planetary economy.\n\nThat every generation poised on the edge of massive change should later seem\noblivious of the issues and the imminent event would seem to be natural\nenough. But it is necessary to understand the power and thrust of technologies\nto isolate the senses and thus to hypnotize society. The formula for hypnosis\nis “one sense at a time.” And new technology possesses the power to hypnotize\nbecause it isolates the senses. Then, as Blake’s formula has it: “They became\nwhat they beheld.” Every new technology thus diminishes sense interplay and\nconsciousness, precisely in the new area of novelty where a kind of\nidentification of viewer and object occurs. This somnambulist conforming of\nbeholder to the new form or structure renders those most deeply immersed in a\nrevolution the least aware of its dynamic. What Polanyi observes about the\ninsentience of those involved in the expediting of the new machine industry is\ntypical of all the local and contemporary attitudes to revolution. It is felt,\nat those times, that the future will be a larger or greatly improved version\nof the _immediate past._ Just before revolutions the image of the immediate\npast is stark and firm, perhaps because it is the only area of sense interplay\nfree from obsessional identification with new technological form.\n\nNo more extreme instance of this delusion could be mentioned than our present\nimage of TV as a current variation on the mechanical, movie pattern of\nprocessing experience by repetition. A few decades hence it will be easy to\ndescribe the revolution in human perception and motivation that resulted from\nbeholding the new mosaic mesh of the TV image. Today it is futile to discuss\nit at all.\n\nLooking back to the revolution in literary forms in the later eighteenth\ncentury, Raymond Williams writes in _Culture and Society, 1780-1850_ ([p.\n42](ch02.html#page_42)) that “changes in convention only occur when there are\nradical changes in the general structure of feeling.” Again, “while in one\nsense the market was specializing the artist, artists themselves were seeking\nto generalize their skills into the common property of imaginative truth.”\n([p. 43](ch02.html#page_43)) This can be seen in the Romantics who,\ndiscovering their inability to talk to conscious men, began by myth and symbol\nto address the unconscious levels of dream life. The imaginative reunion with\ntribal man was scarcely a voluntary strategy of culture.\n\nOne of the most radical of new literary conventions of the market society of\nthe eighteenth century was the novel. It had been preceded by the discovery of\n“equitone prose.” Addison and Steele, as much as anybody else, had devised\nthis novelty of maintaining a single consistent tone to the reader. It was the\nauditory equivalent of the mechanically fixed view in vision. Mysteriously, it\nis this break-through into equitone prose which suddenly enabled the mere\nauthor to become a “man of letters.” He could abandon his patron and approach\nthe large homogenized public of a market society in a consistent and\ncomplacent role. So that with both sight and sound given homogeneous\ntreatment, the writer was able to approach the mass public. What he had to\noffer the public was equally a homogenized body of common experience such as\nthe movie finally took over from the novel. Dr. Johnson devoted his _Rambler\nno. 4_ (March 31, 1750) to this theme:\n\nThe works of fiction, with which the present generation seems more\nparticularly delighted, are such as exhibit life in its true state,\ndiversified only by accidents that daily happen in the world, and influenced\nby passions and qualities which are really to be found in conversing with\nmankind.\n\nJohnson shrewdly notes the consequences of this new form of social realism,\nindicating its basic deviation from the forms of book learning:\n\nThe task of our present writers is very different; it requires, together with\nthat learning which is to be gained from books, that experience which can\nnever be attained by solitary diligence, but must arise from general converse\nand accurate observation of the living world. Their performances have, as\nHorace expresses it, _plus oneris quantum veniae minus_ , little indulgence,\nand therefore more difficulty. They are engaged in portraits of which every\none knows the original, and can detect any deviation from exactness of\nresemblance. Other writings are safe, except from the malice of learning, but\nthese are in danger from every common reader; as the slipper ill executed was\ncensured by a shoemaker who happened to stop in his way at the Venus of\nApelles.\n\nJohnson continues in this vein, pointing out further rivalries between the new\nnovel and the older modes of book learning:\n\nIn the romances formerly written, every transaction and sentiment was so\nremote from all that passes among men, that the reader was in very little\ndanger of making any applications to himself; the virtues and crimes were\nequally beyond his sphere of activity; and he amused himself with heroes and\nwith traitors, deliverers and persecutors, as with beings of another species,\nwhose actions were regulated upon motives of their own, and who had neither\nfaults nor excellencies in common with himself.\n\nBut when an adventurer is levelled with the rest of the world, and acts in\nsuch scenes of the universal drama, as may be the lot of any other man; young\nspectators fix their eyes upon him with closer attention, and hope, by\nobserving his behaviour and success, to regulate their own practices, when\nthey shall be engaged in the like part.\n\nFor this reason these familiar histories may perhaps be made of greater use\nthan the solemnities of professed morality, and convey the knowledge of vice\nand virtue with more efficacy than axioms and definitions.\n\nQuite parallel with this extension of the book page into the form of a talking\npicture of ordinary life, was what Leo Lowenthal mentions in _Popular Culture\nand Society_ ([p. 75](ch02.html#page_75)) as “the crucial shift from Patron to\nPublic,” citing the testimony of Oliver Goldsmith’s 1759 _Enquiry into the\nPresent State of Polite Learning in Europe_ :\n\nAt present the few poets of England no longer depend on the Great for\nsubsistence, they have now no other patrons but the public, and _the public_ ,\ncollectively considered, _is a good and generous master_. … A writer of real\nmerit now may easily be rich if his heart be set only on fortune: and for\nthose who have no merit, it is but fit that such should remain in merited\nobscurity.\n\nLeo Lowenthal’s new study of popular literary culture is not only concerned\nwith the eighteenth century and after, but studies the dilemmas of diversion\n_v._ salvation through art from Montaigne and Pascal to modern magazine\niconology. In pointing out how Goldsmith made a great change in criticism by\nshifting attention to the _experience_ of the reader, Lowenthal has broken\nrich new ground ([pp. 107](ch02.html#page_107)–8):\n\nBut perhaps the most far-reaching change which took place in the concept of\nthe critic was that a two-way function was premised for him. Not only was he\nto reveal the beauties of literary works to the general public by means of\nwhich, in Goldsmith’s terms, “even the philosopher may acquire popular\napplause”; he must also interpret the public back to the writer. In brief, the\ncritic not only “teaches the vulgar on what part of a character to lay the\nemphasis of praise,” he must also show “the scholar where to point his\napplication so as to deserve it.” Goldsmith believed that the absence of such\ncritical mediators explained why wealth rather than true literary fame was the\ngoal of so many writers. The result, he feared, might be that nothing would be\nremembered of the literary works of his time.\n\nWe have observed that Goldsmith, in his endeavor to come to grips with the\ndilemma of the writer, represented a variety of sometimes conflicting views.\nWe have seen, however, that it was likely to be Goldsmith in his optimistic\nrather than in his pessimistic vein who set the tone for what was to come. So,\ntoo, his view of the “ideal” critic, of his function as one of mediation\nbetween the audience and the writer, was to prevail. Critics, writers, and\nphilosophers – Johnson, Burke, Hume, Reynolds, Kames, and the Whartons – all\nadopted Goldsmith’s premise as they began to analyze the experience of the\nreader.\n\nAs the market society defined itself, literature moved into the role of\nconsumer commodity. The public became patron. Art reversed its role from guide\nfor perception into convenient amenity or package. But the producer or artist\nwas compelled, as never before, to study the effect of his art. This in turn\nrevealed to human attention new dimensions of the function of art. As\nmanipulators of the mass market tyrannized over the artist, the artist in\nisolation achieved new clairvoyance concerning the crucial role of design and\nof art as a means to human order and fulfilment. Art has become as total in\nits mandate for human order as the mass markets that created the plateau from\nwhich all can now share the awareness of new scope and potential for everyday\nbeauty and order in all aspects of life at once. Retrospectively, it may well\nprove necessary to concede to the period of mass marketing the creation of the\nmeans of a world order in beauty as much as in commodities.\n\nIt is quite easy to establish the fact that the same means that served to\ncreate the world of consumer abundance by mass production served also to put\nthe highest levels of artistic production on a more assured and consciously\ncontrolled basis. And, as usual, when some previously opaque area becomes\ntranslucent, it is because we have moved into another phase from which we can\ncontemplate the contours of the preceding situation with ease and clarity. It\nis this fact that makes it feasible to write _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ at all. As\nwe experience the new electronic and organic age with ever stronger\nindications of its main outlines, the preceding mechanical age becomes quite\nintelligible. Now that the assembly line recedes before the new patterns of\ninformation, synchronized by electric tape, the miracles of mass-production\nassume entire intelligibility. But the novelties of automation, creating\nworkless and propertyless communities, envelop us in new uncertainties.\n\nA most luminous passage of A. N. Whitehead’s classic _Science and the Modern\nWorld_ ([p. 141](ch02a.html#page_141)) is one that was discussed previously in\nanother connection.\n\nThe greatest invention of the nineteenth century was the invention of the\nmethod of invention. A new method entered into life. In order to understand\nour epoch, we can neglect all the details of change, such as railways,\ntelegraphs, radios, spinning machines, synthetic dyes. We must concentrate on\nthe method in itself; that is the real novelty, which has broken up the\nfoundations of the old civilisation. The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now\nbeen fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than\nthe angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It\nstill remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts.\n\nWhitehead is right in insisting that “we must concentrate on the method\nitself.” It was the Gutenberg method of homogeneous segmentation, for which\ncenturies of phonetic literacy had prepared the psychological ground, that\nevoked the traits of the modern world. The numerous galaxy of events and\nproducts of that method of mechanization of handicrafts, are merely incidental\nto the method itself. It is the method of the fixed or specialist point of\nview that insists on repetition as the criterion of truth and practicality.\nToday our science and method strive not towards a point of view but to\ndiscover how not to have a point of view, the method not of closure and\nperspective but of the open “field” and the suspended judgment. Such is now\nthe only viable method under electric conditions of simultaneous information\nmovement and total human interdependence.\n\nWhitehead does not elaborate on the great nineteenth century discovery of the\nmethod of invention. But it is, quite simply, the technique of beginning at\nthe end of any operation whatever, and of working backwards from that point to\nthe beginning. It is the method inherent in the Gutenberg technique of\nhomogeneous segmentation, but not until the nineteenth century was the method\nextended from production to consumption. Planned production means that the\ntotal process must be worked out in exact stages, backwards, like a detective\nstory. In the first great age of mass production of commodities, and of\nliterature as a commodity for the market, it became necessary to study the\nconsumer’s experience. In a word it became necessary to examine the _effect_\nof art and literature before producing anything at all. This is the _literal_\nentrance to the world of myth.\n\nIt was Edgar Allan Poe who first worked out the rationale of this ultimate\nawareness of the poetic process and who saw that instead of directing the work\nto the reader, it was necessary to incorporate the reader in the work. Such\nwas his plan in “the philosophy of composition.” And Baudelaire and Valéry, at\nleast, recognized in Poe a man of the Leonardo da Vinci stature. Poe saw\nplainly that the anticipation of effect was the only way to achieve organic\ncontrol for the creative process. T. S. Eliot, like Baudelaire and Valéry,\ngives his entire sanction to Poe’s discovery. In a celebrated passage of his\nessay on _Hamlet_ ,[7](ch03_fn05.html#ch03_fn05fn7) he writes:\n\nThe only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an\n“objective correlative”; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a\nchain of events which shall be the formula of that _particular_ emotion; such\nthat when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are\ngiven, the emotion is immediately evoked. If you examine any of Shakespeare’s\nmore successful tragedies, you will find this exact equivalence; you will find\nthat the state of mind of Lady Macbeth walking in her sleep has been\ncommunicated to you by a skilful accumulation of imagined sensory impressions;\nthe words of Macbeth on hearing of his wife’s death strike us as if, given the\nsequence of events, these words were automatically released by the last event\nin the series.\n\nPoe set this method to work in many of his poems and stories. But it is most\nobvious in his invention of the detective story in which Dupin, his sleuth, is\nan artist-esthete who solves crimes by a method of artistic perception. Not\nonly is the detective story the great popular instance of working backwards\nfrom effect to cause, it is also the form in which the reader is deeply\ninvolved as co-author. Such is also the case in symbolist poetry whose\ncompletion of effect from moment to moment requires the reader to participate\nin the poetic process itself.\n\nIt is a characteristic chiasmus that waits upon the utmost development of any\nprocess that the last phase shall show characteristics opposite to the early\nphases. A typical example of massive psychic chiasmus or reversal occurred\nwhen Western man fought the harder for individuality as he surrendered the\nidea of unique personal existence. The nineteenth century artists made a mass-\nsurrender of that unique selfhood, that had been taken for granted in the\neighteenth century, as the new mass pressures made the burdens of selfhood too\nheavy. Just as Mill fought for individuality even though he had given up the\nself, the poets and artists moved towards the idea of impersonal process in\nart production in proportion as they berated the new masses for impersonal\nprocess in the consumption of art products. A similar and related reversal or\nchiasmus occurred when the consumer of popular art was invited by new art\nforms to become participant in the art process itself.\n\nThis was the moment of transcendence of the Gutenberg technology. The\ncenturies-old separation of senses and functions ended in a quite unexpected\nunity.\n\nThe reversal by which the presence of the new markets and the new masses\nencouraged the artist to surrender the unique self might have seemed a final\nconsummation for art and technology alike. It was a surrender made almost\ninevitable when the symbolists began to work backwards from effect to cause in\nthe shaping of the art product. Yet it was just at this extreme moment that a\nnew reversal occurred. The art process had no sooner approached the rigorous,\nimpersonal rationale of the industrial process, in the period from Poe to\nValéry, than the assembly line of symbolist art was transformed into the new\n“stream of consciousness” mode of presentation. And the stream of\nconsciousness is an open “field” perception that reverses all aspects of the\nnineteenth century discovery of the assembly-line or of the “technique of\ninvention.” As G. H. Bantock writes of it:\n\nin a world of increasing socialization, standardization, and uniformity, the\naim was to stress uniqueness, the purely personal in experience; in one of\n“mechanical” rationality, to assert other modes through which human beings can\nexpress themselves, to see life as a series of emotional intensities involving\na logic different from that of the rational world and capturable only in\ndissociated images or stream of consciousness\nmusings.[8](ch03_fn06.html#ch03_fn06fn8)\n\nThus the technique of the suspended judgment, the great discovery of the\ntwentieth century in art and physics alike, is a recoil and transformation of\nthe impersonal assembly-line of nineteenth century art and science. And to\nspeak of the stream of consciousness as unlike the rational world is merely to\ninsist upon visual sequence as the rational norm, handing art over to the\nunconscious quite gratuitously. For what is meant by the irrational and the\nnon-logical in much modern discussion is merely the rediscovery of the\nordinary transactions between the self and the world, or between subject and\nobject. Such transactions had seemed to end with the effects of phonetic\nliteracy in the Greek world. Literacy had made of the enlightened individual a\nclosed system, and set up a gap between appearance and reality which ended\nwith such discoveries as the stream of consciousness.\n\nAs Joyce expressed it in the _Wake_ , “My consumers are they not my\nproducers?” Consistently, the twentieth century has worked to free itself from\nthe conditions of passivity, which is to say, from the Gutenberg heritage\nitself. And this dramatic struggle of unlike modes of human insight and\noutlook has resulted in the greatest of all human ages, whether in the arts or\nin the sciences. We are living in a period richer and more terrible than the\n“Shakespearean Moment” so well described by Patrick Cruttwell in his book of\nthe same title. But it has been the business of _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ to\nexamine only the mechanical technology emergent from our alphabet and the\nprinting press. What will be the new configurations of mechanisms and of\nliteracy as these older forms of perception and judgment are interpenetrated\nby the new electric age? The new electric galaxy of events has already moved\ndeeply into the Gutenberg galaxy. Even without collision, such co-existence of\ntechnologies and awareness brings trauma and tension to every living person.\nOur most ordinary and conventional attitudes seem suddenly twisted into\ngargoyles and grotesques. Familiar institutions and associations seem at times\nmenacing and malignant. These multiple transformations, which are the normal\nconsequence of introducing new media into any society whatever, need special\nstudy and will be the subject of another volume on _Understanding Media_ in\nthe world of our time.\n\n\n## Bibliographic Index\n\nAnshen, R.

a world of roles to a world\nof jobs.\n\n[**18**](ch02.html#page_18) The anguish of the third dimension is given its\nfirst verbal manifestation in poetic history in _King Lear._\n\n[**21**](ch02.html#page_21) The interiorization of the technology of the\nphonetic alphabet translates man from the magical world of the ear to the\nneutral visual world.\n\n[**26**](ch02.html#page_26) Schizophrenia may be a necessary consequence of\nliteracy.\n\n[**28**](ch02.html#page_28) Does the interiorization of media such as\n“letters” alter the ratio among our senses and change mental processes?\n\n[**30**](ch02.html#page_30) Civilization gives the barbarian or tribal man an\neye for an ear and is now at odds with the electronic world.\n\n[**33**](ch02.html#page_33) The modern physicist is at home with oriental\nfield theory.\n\n[**36**](ch02.html#page_36) The new electronic interdependence recreates the\nworld in the image of a global village.\n\n[**38**](ch02.html#page_38) Literacy affects the physiology as well as the\npsychic life of the African.\n\n[**41**](ch02.html#page_41) Why non-literate societies catnnot see films or\nphotos without much training.\n\n[**44**](ch02.html#page_44) African audiences cannot accept our passive\nconsumer role in the presence of film.\n\n[**47**](ch02.html#page_47) When technology extends _one_ of our senses, a new\ntranslation of culture occurs as swiftly as the new technology is\ninteriorized.\n\n[**49**](ch02.html#page_49) A theory of cultural change is impossible without\nknowledge of the changing sense ratios effected by various externalizations of\nour senses.\n\n[**51**](ch02.html#page_51) The twentieth century encounter between alphabetic\nand electronic faces of culture confers on the printed word a crucial role in\nstaying the return to “the Africa within.”\n\n[**54**](ch02.html#page_54) Current concern with reading and spelling reform\nsteers away from visual to auditory stress.\n\n[**56**](ch02.html#page_56) The alphabet is an aggressive and militant\nabsorber and transformer of cultures, as Harold Innis was the first to show.\n\n[**58**](ch02.html#page_58) The Homeric hero becomes a split-man as he assumes\nan individual ego.\n\n[**61**](ch02.html#page_61) The world of the Greeks illustrates why visual\nappearances cannot interest a people before the interiorization of alphabetic\ntechnology.\n\n[**64**](ch02.html#page_64) The Greek “point of view” in both art and\nchronology has little in common with ours but was much like that of the Middle\nAges.\n\n[**66**](ch02.html#page_66) The Greeks invented both their artistic and\nscientific novelties after the interiorization of the alphabet.\n\n[**70**](ch02.html#page_70) The continuity of Greek and medieval art was\nassured by the bond between _caelatura_ or engraving and illumination.\n\n[**72**](ch02.html#page_72) The increase of visual stress among the Greeks\nalienated them from the primitive art that the electronic age now reinvents\nafter interiorizing the “unified field” of electric all-at-onceness.\n\n[**73**](ch02.html#page_73) A nomadic society cannot experience enclosed\nspace.\n\n[**77**](ch02.html#page_77) Primitivism has become the vulgar _cliché_ of much\nmodern art and speculation.\n\n[**79**](ch02.html#page_79) _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ is concerned to show why\nalphabetic man was disposed to desacralize his mode of being.\n\n[**81**](ch02.html#page_81) The method of the twentieth century is to use not\nsingle but multiple models for experimental exploration – the technique of the\nsuspended judgment.\n\n[**84**](ch02.html#page_84) Only a fraction of the history of literacy has\nbeen typographic.\n\n[**86**](ch02.html#page_86) Until now a culture has been a mechanical fate for\nsocieties, the automatic interiorization of their own technologies.\n\n[**88**](ch02.html#page_88) The techniques of uniformity and repeatability\nwere introduced by the Romans and the Middle Ages.\n\n[**91**](ch02.html#page_91) The word “modern” was a term of reproach used by\nthe patristic humanists [please remove page break]against the medieval\nschoolmen who developed the new logic and physics.\n\n[**94**](ch02.html#page_94) In antiquity and the Middle Ages reading was\nnecessarily reading aloud.\n\n[**96**](ch02.html#page_96) Manuscript culture is conversational if only\nbecause the writer and his audience are physically related by the form of\n_publication as performance._\n\n[**99**](ch02.html#page_99) The manuscript shaped medieval literary\nconventions at all levels.\n\n[**103**](ch02.html#page_103) The traditional lore of school children points\nto the gap between the scribal and typographic man.\n\n[**105**](ch02.html#page_105) The medieval monks’ reading carrell was indeed a\nsinging booth.\n\n[**107**](ch02.html#page_107) In the chantry schools grammar served, above\nall, to establish oral fidelity.\n\n[**109**](ch02.html#page_109) The medieval student had to be paleographer,\neditor, and publisher of the authors he read.\n\n[**112**](ch02.html#page_112) Aquinas explains why Socrates, Christ, and\nPythagoras avoided the publication of their teachings.\n\n[**114**](ch02.html#page_114) The rise of the schoolmen or _moderni_ in the\ntwelfth century made a sharp break with the “ancients” of traditional\nChristian scholarship.\n\n[**117**](ch02.html#page_117) Scholasticism, like Senecanism, was directly\nrelated to the oral traditions of aphoristic learning.\n\n[**120**](ch02.html#page_120) Scribal culture and Gothic architecture were\nboth concerned with light _through_ , not light _on_.\n\n[**123**](ch02a.html#page_123) Medieval illumination, gloss, and sculpture\nalike were aspects of the art of memory, central to scribal culture.\n\n[**126**](ch02a.html#page_126) For the oral man the literal text contains all\npossible levels of meaning.\n\n[**128**](ch02a.html#page_128) The sheer increase in the quantity of\ninformation movement favoured the visual organization of knowledge and the\nrise of perspective even before typography.\n\n[**131**](ch02a.html#page_131) The same clash between written and oral\nstructures of knowledge occurs in medieval social life.\n\n[**134**](ch02a.html#page_134) The medieval world ended in a frenzy of applied\nknowledge – new medieval knowledge applied to the recreation of antiquity.\n\n[**136**](ch02a.html#page_136) Renaissance Italy became a kind of Hollywood\ncollection of _sets_ of antiquity, and the new visual antiquarianism of the\nRenaissance provided an avenue to power for men of any class.\n\n[**138**](ch02a.html#page_138) Medieval idols of the king\n\n[**142**](ch02a.html#page_142) The invention of typography confirmed and\nextended the new visual stress of applied knowledge, providing the first\nuniformly repeatable “commodity,” the first assembly-line, and the first mass-\nproduction.\n\n[**144**](ch02a.html#page_144) A fixed point of view becomes possible with\nprint and ends the image as a plastic organism.\n\n[**146**](ch02a.html#page_146) How the “natural magic” of the _camera obscura_\nanticipated Hollywood in turning the spectacle of the external world into a\nconsumer commodity or package.\n\n[**147**](ch02a.html#page_147) St. Thomas More offers a plan for a bridge over\nthe turbulent river of scholastic philosophy.\n\n[**149**](ch02a.html#page_149) Scribal culture could have neither authors nor\npublics such as were created by typography.\n\n[**152**](ch02a.html#page_152) The medieval book trade was a second-hand trade\neven as with the dealing today in “old masters.”\n\n[**154**](ch02a.html#page_154) Until more than two centuries after printing\nnobody discovered how to maintain a single tone or attitude throughout a prose\ncomposition.\n\n[**156**](ch02a.html#page_156) Later medieval visual stress muddied liturgical\npiety as much as electronic-field pressure has clarified it today.\n\n[**161**](ch02a.html#page_161) The “interface” of the Renaissance was the\nmeeting of medieval pluralism and modern homogeneity and mechanism – a formula\nfor blitz and metamorphosis.\n\n[**164**](ch02a.html#page_164) Peter Ramus and John Dewey were the two\neducational “surfers” or wave-riders of antithetic periods, the Gutenberg and\nthe Marconi or electronic.\n\n[**167**](ch02a.html#page_167) Rabelais offers a vision of the future of print\nculture as a consumer’s paradise of applied knowledge.\n\n[**170**](ch02a.html#page_170) The celebrated earthy tactility of Rabelais is\na massive backwash of receding manuscript culture.\n\n[**171**](ch02a.html#page_171) Typography as the first mechanization of a\nhandicraft is itself the perfect instance not of a new knowledge, but of\napplied knowledge.\n\n[**174**](ch02a.html#page_174) Every technology contrived and “outered” by man\nhas the power to numb human awareness during the period of its first\ninteriorization.\n\n[**177**](ch02a.html#page_177) With Gutenberg Europe enters the technological\nphase of progress, when change itself becomes the archetypal norm of social\nlife.\n\n[**180**](ch02a.html#page_180) Applied knowledge in the Renaissance had to\ntake the form of translation of the auditory into visual terms, of the plastic\ninto retinal form.\n\n[**183**](ch02a.html#page_183) Typography tended to alter language from a\nmeans of perception and exploration to a portable commodity.\n\n[**186**](ch02a.html#page_186) Typography is not only a technology but is in\nitself a natural resource or staple, like cotton or timber or radio; and, like\nany staple, it shapes not only private sense ratios but also patterns of\ncommunal interdependence.\n\n[**189**](ch02a.html#page_189) The passion for exact measurement began to\ndominate the Renaissance.\n\n[**193**](ch02a.html#page_193) The print-made split between head and heart is\nthe trauma which affects Europe from Machiavelli till the present.\n\n[**198**](ch02a.html#page_198) The Machiavellian mind and the merchant mind\nare at one in their simple faith in the power of segmental division to rule\nall – in the dichotomy of power and morals and of money and morals.\n\n[**200**](ch02a.html#page_200) Dantzig explains why the language of number had\nto be increased to meet the needs created by the new technology of letters.\n\n[**203**](ch02a.html#page_203) How the Greeks encountered the confusion of\ntongues when numbers invaded Euclidean space.\n\n[**205**](ch02a.html#page_205) The great sixteenth century divorce between art\nand science came with accelerated calculators.\n\n[**208**](ch02a.html#page_208) Francis Bacon, PR voice for the _moderni_ , had\nboth his feet in the Middle Ages.\n\n[**211**](ch02b.html#page_211) A strange wedding of the medieval Book of\nNature and the new book from movable types was conducted by Francis Bacon.\n\n[**214**](ch02b.html#page_214) Bacon’s Adam is a medieval mystic and Milton’s\na trade union organizer.\n\n[**217**](ch02b.html#page_217) How far did the mass-produced page of print\nbecome a substitute for auricular confession.\n\n[**220**](ch02b.html#page_220) Aretino, like Rabelais and Cervantes,\nproclaimed the meaning of Typography as Gargantuan, Fantastic, Supra-human.\n\n[**223**](ch02b.html#page_223) Marlowe anticipated Whitman’s barbaric yawp by\nsetting up a national PA system of blank verse – a rising iambic system of\nsound to suit the new success story.\n\n[**226**](ch02b.html#page_226) Print, in turning the vernaculars into mass\nmedia, or closed systems, created the uniform, centralizing forces of modern\nnationalism.\n\n[**227**](ch02b.html#page_227) The divorce of poetry and music was first\nreflected by the printed page.\n\n[**229**](ch02b.html#page_229) The oral polyphony of the prose of Nashe\noffends against lineal and literary decorum.\n\n[**230**](ch02b.html#page_230) The printing press was at first mistaken for an\nengine of immortality by everybody except Shakespeare.\n\n[**235**](ch02b.html#page_235) The portability of the book, like that of the\neasel-painting, added much to the new cult of individualism.\n\n[**237**](ch02b.html#page_237) The uniformity and repeatability of print\ncreated the “political arithmetic” of the seventeenth century and the\n“hedonistic calculus” of the eighteenth.\n\n[**241**](ch02b.html#page_241) The typographic logic created “the outsider,”\nthe alienated man, as the type of integral, that is, intuitive and\n_irrational_ , man.\n\n[**242**](ch02b.html#page_242) Cervantes confronted typographic man in the\nfigure of Don Quixote.\n\n[**245**](ch02b.html#page_245) Typographic man can express but is helpless to\nread the configurations of print technology.\n\n[**248**](ch02b.html#page_248) The historians, although aware that nationalism\noriginated in the sixteenth century, have yet no explanation of this passion\nthat preceded theory.\n\n[**250**](ch02b.html#page_250) Nationalism insists

part of the program of applied knowledge in the seventeenth century.\n\n[**267**](ch02b.html#page_267) Print created national uniformity and\ngovernment centralism, but also individualism and

is\ncinematic and sequential and pictorial.\n\n[**276**](ch02b.html#page_276) The denuding of conscious life and its\nreduction to a single level created the new world of the “unconscious” in the\nseventeenth century. The stage has been cleared of the archetypes or postures\nof individual mind, and is ready for the archetypes of the collective\nunconscious.\n\n[**278**](ch02b.html#page_278) Philosophy was as naive as science in its\nunconscious acceptance of the assumptions or dynamic of typography.\n\n[**280**](ch02b.html#page_280) Heidegger surf-boards along on the electronic\nwave as triumphantly as Descartes rode the mechanical wave.\n\n[**283**](ch02b.html#page_283) Typography cracked the voices of silence.\n\n[**286**](ch02b.html#page_286) The Gutenberg galaxy was theoretically\ndissolved in 1905 with the discovery of curved space, but in practice it had\nbeen invaded by the telegraph two generations before that.\n\n[**288**](ch02b.html#page_288) Pope’s _Dunciad_ indicts the printed book as\nthe agent of a primitivistic and Romantic revival. Sheer visual quantity\nevokes the magical resonance of the tribal horde. The box office looms as a\nreturn to the echo chamber of bardic incantation.\n\n[**293**](ch02b.html#page_293) The new collective unconscious Pope saw as the\naccumulating backwash of private self-expression.\n\n[**295**](ch02b.html#page_295) The last book of _The Dunciad_ proclaims the\nmetamorphic power of mechanically applied knowledge as a stupendous parody of\nthe Eucharist.\n\n\n[1](ch01.html#ch01_fn01fn1a) Quoted in _The Singer of Tales_ , [p.\n3](ch01.html#page_3).\n\n\n[2](ch01.html#ch01_fn02fn2a) _Trade and Market in the Early Empires_ , [p.\n5](ch01.html#page_5).\n\n\n[3](ch01.html#ch01_fn03fn3a) Edward T.

S. Baldwin, _Medieval Rhetoric and\nPoetic_ , and D. L. Clark, _Rhetoric and Poetry in the Renaissance_. They find\nthis Ciceronian fusion of poetic and rhetoric puzzling. But Milton accepted\nit. He takes the Ciceronian view in his tract _On Education._ After grammar,\nhe says, just so much logic should be studied as is useful to “a graceful and\nornate rhetoric.” To these “poetry would be made subsequent, or indeed rather\nprecedent, as being less subtile and fine, but more simple, sensuous and\npassionate.” These latter words of Milton have often been cited out of context\nand without any regard for the precise technical sense of Milton’s language.\n\n[27](ch02.html#ch02a_fn24fn27a) H.-I. Marrou, _Saint Augustin et la fin de la\nculture antique_ , p. 530, note.\n\n\n[28](ch02.html#ch02a_fn25fn28a) In the sixteenth century the Elizabethan\nactors were sometimes referred to as “the rhetoricians.” This was natural in a\ntime that studied _pronuntiatio_ as much as the other four parts of rhetoric:\n_inventio_ , _dispositio_ , _elocutio_ , and _memoria_. See B. L. Joseph’s\nfine study, _Elizabethan Acting_ , in which from the sixteenth century manuals\nof grammar and rhetoric he derives the numerous techniques of dramatic\ndelivery and action with which every Elizabethan school child was acquainted.\n\n\n[29](ch02.html#ch02a_fn26fn29a) _Roman Declamation_ , [p.\n10](ch01.html#page_10).

E. A. Lowe remarks: “The Gothic script is\ndifficult to read … It is as if the written page was to be looked at and not\nread” (in “Handwriting” in G. C. Crump and E. F.

He\nsaw it differently: _My mind wanders around, and I conceive of different\nthings day and night. Like a science-fiction writer, I’m thinking_ , _“What if\nit were like this?”_[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1141863)\n\nAs it happened, 1948 was when the Bell Telephone Laboratories announced the\ninvention of a tiny electronic semiconductor, “an amazingly simple device”\nthat could do anything a vacuum tube could do and more efficiently. It was a\ncrystalline sliver, so small that a hundred would fit in the palm of a hand.\nIn May, scientists formed a committee to come up with a name, and the\ncommittee passed out paper ballots to senior engineers in Murray Hill, New\nJersey, listing some choices: _semiconductor triode_ …  _iotatron_ …\n_transistor_ (a hybrid of _varistor_ and _transconductance_). _Transistor_ won\nout. “It may have far-reaching significance in electronics and electrical\ncommunication,” Bell Labs declared in a press release, and for once the\nreality surpassed the hype. The transistor sparked the revolution in\nelectronics, setting the technology on its path of miniaturization and\nubiquity, and soon won the Nobel Prize for its three chief inventors. For the\nlaboratory it was the jewel in the crown. But it was only the second most\nsignificant development of that year. The transistor was only hardware.\n\nAn invention even more profound and more fundamental came in a monograph\nspread across seventy-nine pages of _The Bell System Technical Journal_ in\nJuly and October. No one bothered with a press release. It carried a title\nboth simple and grand—“A Mathematical Theory of Communication”—and the message\nwas hard to summarize. But it was a fulcrum around which the world began to\nturn. Like the transistor, this development also involved a neologism: the\nword _bit_ , chosen in this case not by committee but by the lone author, a\nthirty-two-year-old named Claude\nShannon.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1142188) The bit now joined the inch,\nthe pound, the quart, and the minute as a determinate quantity—a fundamental\nunit of measure.\n\nBut measuring what? “A unit for measuring information,” Shannon wrote, as\nthough there were such a thing, measurable and quantifiable, as information.\n\nShannon supposedly belonged to the Bell Labs mathematical research group, but\nhe mostly kept to himself.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1142466) When the\ngroup left the New York headquarters for shiny new space in the New Jersey\nsuburbs, he stayed behind, haunting a cubbyhole in the old building, a twelve-\nstory sandy brick hulk on West Street, its industrial back to the Hudson\nRiver, its front facing the edge of Greenwich Village. He disliked commuting,\nand he liked the downtown neighborhood, where he could hear jazz clarinetists\nin late-night clubs. He was flirting shyly with a young woman who worked in\nBell Labs’ microwave research group in the two-story former Nabisco factory\nacross the street. People considered him a smart young man. Fresh from MIT he\nhad plunged into the laboratory’s war work, first developing an automatic\nfire-control director for antiaircraft guns, then focusing on the theoretical\nunderpinnings of secret communication—cryptography—and working out a\nmathematical proof of the security of the so-called X System, the telephone\nhotline between Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt. So now his managers\nwere willing to leave him alone, even though they did not understand exactly\nwhat he was working on.\n\nAT&T at midcentury did not demand instant gratification from its research\ndivision. It allowed detours into mathematics or astrophysics with no apparent\ncommercial purpose. Anyway so much of modern science bore directly or\nindirectly on the company’s mission, which was vast, monopolistic, and almost\nall-encompassing. Still, broad as it was, the telephone company’s core subject\nmatter remained just out of focus. By 1948 more than 125 million conversations\npassed daily through the Bell System’s 138 million miles of cable and 31\nmillion telephone sets.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1142670) The Bureau of\nthe Census reported these facts under the rubric of “Communications in the\nUnited States,” but they were crude measures of communication. The census also\ncounted several thousand broadcasting stations for radio and a few dozen for\ntelevision, along with newspapers, books, pamphlets, and the mail. The post\noffice counted its letters and parcels, but what, exactly, did the Bell System\ncarry, counted in what units? Not _conversations_ , surely; nor _words_ , nor\ncertainly _characters_. Perhaps it was just electricity. The company’s\nengineers were electrical engineers. Everyone understood that electricity\nserved as a surrogate for sound, the sound of the human voice, waves in the\nair entering the telephone mouthpiece and converted into electrical waveforms.\nThis conversion was the essence of the telephone’s advance over the\ntelegraph—the predecessor technology, already seeming so quaint. Telegraphy\nrelied on a different sort of conversion: a code of dots and dashes, not based\non sounds at all but on the written alphabet, which was, after all, a code in\nits turn. Indeed, considering the matter closely, one could see a chain of\nabstraction and conversion: the dots and dashes representing letters of the\nalphabet; the letters representing sounds, and in combination forming words;\nthe words representing some ultimate substrate of meaning, perhaps best left\nto philosophers.\n\nThe Bell System had none of those, but the company had hired its first\nmathematician in 1897: George Campbell, a Minnesotan who had studied in\nGöttingen and Vienna. He immediately confronted a crippling problem of early\ntelephone transmission. Signals were distorted as they passed across the\ncircuits; the greater the distance, the worse the distortion. Campbell’s\nsolution was partly mathematics and partly electrical\nengineering.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1143047) His employers learned not\nto worry much about the distinction. Shannon himself, as a student, had never\nbeen quite able to decide whether to become an engineer or a mathematician.\nFor Bell Labs he was both, willy-nilly, practical about circuits and relays\nbut happiest in a realm of symbolic abstraction. Most communications engineers\nfocused their expertise on physical problems, amplification and modulation,\nphase distortion and signal-to-noise degradation. Shannon liked games and\npuzzles. Secret codes entranced him, beginning when he was a boy reading Edgar\nAllan Poe. He gathered threads like a magpie. As a first-year research\nassistant at MIT, he worked on a hundred-ton proto-computer, Vannevar Bush’s\nDifferential Analyzer, which could solve equations with great rotating gears,\nshafts, and wheels. At twenty-two he wrote a dissertation that applied a\nnineteenth-century idea, George Boole’s algebra of logic, to the design of\nelectrical circuits. (Logic and electricity—a peculiar combination.) Later he\nworked with the mathematician and logician Hermann Weyl, who taught him what a\ntheory was: “Theories permit consciousness to ‘jump over its own shadow,’ to\nleave behind the given, to represent the transcendent, yet, as is self-\nevident, only in symbols.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1143328)\n\nIn 1943 the English mathematician and code breaker Alan Turing visited Bell\nLabs on a cryptographic mission and met Shannon sometimes over lunch, where\nthey traded speculation on the future of artificial thinking machines.\n(“Shannon wants to feed not just _data_ to a Brain, but cultural\nthings!”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1143784) Turing exclaimed. “He wants to\nplay music to it!”) Shannon also crossed paths with Norbert Wiener, who had\ntaught him at MIT and by 1948 was proposing a new discipline to be called\n“cybernetics,” the study of communication and control. Meanwhile Shannon began\npaying special attention to television signals, from a peculiar point of view:\nwondering whether their content could be somehow compacted or compressed to\nallow for faster transmission. Logic and circuits crossbred to make a new,\nhybrid thing; so did codes and genes. In his solitary way, seeking a framework\nto connect his many threads, Shannon began assembling a theory for\ninformation.\n\nThe raw material lay all around, glistening and buzzing in the landscape of\nthe early twentieth century, letters and messages, sounds and images, news and\ninstructions, figures and facts, signals and signs: a hodgepodge of related\nspecies. They were on the move, by post or wire or electromagnetic wave. But\nno one word denoted all that stuff. “Off and on,” Shannon wrote to Vannevar\nBush at MIT in 1939, “I have been working on an analysis of some of the\nfundamental properties of general systems for the transmission of\nintelligence.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1144085) _Intelligence:_ that was\na flexible term, very old. “Nowe used for an elegant worde,” Sir Thomas Elyot\nwrote in the sixteenth century, “where there is mutuall treaties or\nappoyntementes, eyther by letters or\nmessage.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1144461) It had taken on other\nmeanings, though. A few engineers, especially in the telephone labs, began\nspeaking of _information_. They used the word in a way suggesting something\ntechnical: quantity of information, or measure of information. Shannon adopted\nthis usage.\n\nFor the purposes of science, _information_ had to mean something special.\nThree centuries earlier, the new discipline of physics could not proceed until\nIsaac Newton appropriated words that were ancient and vague— _force_ , _mass,\nmotion_ , and even _time_ —and gave them new meanings. Newton made these terms\ninto quantities, suitable for use in mathematical formulas. Until then,\n_motion_ (for example) had been just as soft and inclusive a term as\n_information_. For Aristotelians, motion covered a far-flung family of\nphenomena: a peach ripening, a stone falling, a child growing, a body\ndecaying. That was too rich. Most varieties of motion had to be tossed out\nbefore Newton’s laws could apply and the Scientific Revolution could succeed.\nIn the nineteenth century, _energy_ began to undergo a similar transformation:\nnatural philosophers adapted a word meaning vigor or intensity. They\nmathematicized it, giving energy its fundamental place in the physicists’ view\nof nature.\n\nIt was the same with information. A rite of purification became necessary.\n\nAnd then, when it was made simple, distilled, counted in bits, information was\nfound to be everywhere. Shannon’s theory made a bridge between information and\nuncertainty; between information and entropy; and between information and\nchaos. It led to compact discs and fax machines, computers and cyberspace,\nMoore’s law and all the world’s Silicon Alleys. Information processing was\nborn, along with information storage and information retrieval. People began\nto name a successor to the Iron Age and the Steam Age. “Man the food-gatherer\nreappears incongruously as information-\ngatherer,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1144706) remarked Marshall McLuhan in\n1967.* He wrote this an instant too soon, in the first dawn of computation and\ncyberspace.\n\nWe can see now that information is what our world runs on: the blood and the\nfuel, the vital principle. It pervades the sciences from top to bottom,\ntransforming every branch of knowledge. Information theory began as a bridge\nfrom mathematics to electrical engineering and from there to computing. What\nEnglish speakers call “computer science” Europeans have known as\n_informatique_ , _informatica_ , and _Informatik_. Now even biology has become\nan information science, a subject of messages, instructions, and code. Genes\nencapsulate information and enable procedures for reading it in and writing it\nout. Life spreads by networking. The body itself is an information processor.\nMemory resides not just in brains but in every cell. No wonder genetics\nbloomed along with information theory. DNA is the quintessential information\nmolecule, the most advanced message processor at the cellular level—an\nalphabet and a code, 6 billion bits to form a human being. “What lies at the\nheart of every living thing is not a fire, not warm breath, not a ‘spark of\nlife,’ ”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1144989) declares the evolutionary\ntheorist Richard Dawkins. “It is information, words, instructions.… If you\nwant to understand life, don’t think about vibrant, throbbing gels and oozes,\nthink about information technology.” The cells of an organism are nodes in a\nrichly interwoven communications network, transmitting and receiving, coding\nand decoding. Evolution itself embodies an ongoing exchange of information\nbetween organism and environment.\n\n“The information circle becomes the unit of\nlife,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1145256) says Werner Loewenstein after\nthirty years spent studying intercellular communication. He reminds us that\n_information_ means something deeper now: “It connotes a cosmic principle of\norganization and order, and it provides an exact measure of that.” The gene\nhas its cultural analog, too: the meme. In cultural evolution, a meme is a\nreplicator and propagator—an idea, a fashion, a chain letter, or a conspiracy\ntheory. On a bad day, a meme is a virus.\n\nEconomics is recognizing itself as an information science, now that money\nitself is completing a developmental arc from matter to bits, stored in\ncomputer memory and magnetic strips, world finance coursing through the global\nnervous system. Even when money seemed to be material treasure, heavy in\npockets and ships’ holds and bank vaults, it always was information. Coins and\nnotes, shekels and cowries were all just short-lived technologies for\ntokenizing information about who owns what.\n\nAnd atoms? Matter has its own coinage, and the hardest science of all,\nphysics, seemed to have reached maturity. But physics, too, finds itself\nsideswiped by a new intellectual model. In the years after World War II, the\nheyday of the physicists, the great news of science appeared to be the\nsplitting of the atom and the control of nuclear energy. Theorists focused\ntheir prestige and resources on the search for fundamental particles and the\nlaws governing their interaction, the construction of giant accelerators and\nthe discovery of quarks and gluons. From this exalted enterprise, the business\nof communications research could not have appeared further removed. At Bell\nLabs, Claude Shannon was not thinking about physics. Particle physicists did\nnot need bits.\n\nAnd then, all at once, they did. Increasingly, the physicists and the\ninformation theorists are one and the same. The bit is a fundamental particle\nof a different sort: not just tiny but abstract—a binary digit, a flip-flop, a\nyes-or-no. It is insubstantial, yet as scientists finally come to understand\ninformation, they wonder whether it may be primary: more fundamental than\nmatter itself. They suggest that the bit is the irreducible kernel and that\ninformation forms the very core of existence. Bridging the physics of the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries, John Archibald Wheeler, the last\nsurviving collaborator of both Einstein and Bohr, put this manifesto in\noracular monosyllables: “It from Bit.” Information gives rise to “every\nit—every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum\nitself.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1145623) This is another way of\nfathoming the paradox of the observer: that the outcome of an experiment is\naffected, or even determined, when it is observed. Not only is the observer\nobserving, she is asking questions and making statements that must ultimately\nbe expressed in discrete bits. “What we call reality,” Wheeler wrote coyly,\n“arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions.” He added:\n“All things physical are information-theoretic in origin, and this is a\nparticipatory universe.” The whole universe is thus seen as a computer—a\ncosmic information-processing machine.\n\nA key to the enigma is a type of relationship that had no place in classical\nphysics: the phenomenon known as entanglement. When particles or quantum\nsystems are entangled, their properties remain correlated across vast\ndistances and vast times. Light-years apart, they share something that is\nphysical, yet not only physical. Spooky paradoxes arise, unresolvable until\none understands how entanglement encodes information, measured in bits or\ntheir drolly named quantum counterpart, qubits. When photons and electrons and\nother particles interact, what are they really doing? Exchanging bits,\ntransmitting quantum states, processing information. The laws of physics are\nthe algorithms. Every burning star, every silent nebula, every particle\nleaving its ghostly trace in a cloud chamber is an information processor. The\nuniverse computes its own destiny.\n\nHow much does it compute? How fast? How big is its total information capacity,\nits memory space? What is the link between energy and information; what is the\nenergy cost of flipping a bit? These are hard questions, but they are not as\nmystical or metaphorical as they sound. Physicists and quantum information\ntheorists, a new breed, struggle with them together. They do the math and\nproduce tentative answers. (“The bit count of the cosmos, however it is\nfigured, is ten raised to a very large\npower,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1145963) according to Wheeler. According\nto Seth Lloyd: “No more than 10120 ops on 1090\nbits.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1146302)) They look anew at the mysteries\nof thermodynamic entropy and at those notorious information swallowers, black\nholes. “Tomorrow,” Wheeler declares, “we will have learned to understand and\nexpress _all_ of physics in the language of\ninformation.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1146600)\n\nAs the role of information grows beyond anyone’s reckoning, it grows to be too\nmuch. “TMI,” people now say. We have information fatigue, anxiety, and glut.\nWe have met the Devil of Information Overload and his impish underlings, the\ncomputer virus, the busy signal, the dead link, and the PowerPoint\npresentation. All this, too, is due in its roundabout way to Shannon.\nEverything changed so quickly. John Robinson Pierce (the Bell Labs engineer\nwho had come up with the word _transistor_) mused afterward: “It is hard to\npicture the world before Shannon as it seemed to those who lived in it. It is\ndifficult to recover innocence, ignorance, and lack of\nunderstanding.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1146869)\n\nYet the past does come back into focus. _In the beginning was the word_ ,\naccording to John. We are the species that named itself _Homo sapiens_ , the\none who knows—and then, after reflection, amended that to _Homo sapiens\nsapiens_. The greatest gift of Prometheus to humanity was not fire after all:\n“Numbers, too, chiefest of sciences, I invented for them, and the combining of\nletters, creative mother of the Muses’ arts, with which to hold all things in\nmemory.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1147200) The alphabet was a founding\ntechnology of information. The telephone, the fax machine, the calculator,\nand, ultimately, the computer are only the latest innovations devised for\nsaving, manipulating, and communicating knowledge. Our culture has absorbed a\nworking vocabulary for these useful inventions. We speak of compressing data,\naware that this is quite different from compressing a gas. We know about\nstreaming information, parsing it, sorting it, matching it, and filtering it.\nOur furniture includes iPods and plasma displays, our skills include texting\nand Googling, we are endowed, we are expert, so we see information in the\nforeground. But it has always been there. It pervaded our ancestors’ world,\ntoo, taking forms from solid to ethereal, granite gravestones and the whispers\nof courtiers. The punched card, the cash register, the nineteenth-century\nDifference Engine, the wires of telegraphy all played their parts in weaving\nthe spiderweb of information to which we cling. Each new information\ntechnology, in its own time, set off blooms in storage and transmission. From\nthe printing press came new species of information organizers: dictionaries,\ncyclopaedias, almanacs—compendiums of words, classifiers of facts, trees of\nknowledge. Hardly any information technology goes obsolete. Each new one\nthrows its predecessors into relief. Thus Thomas Hobbes, in the seventeenth\ncentury, resisted his era’s new-media hype: “The invention of printing, though\ningenious, compared with the invention of letters is no great\nmatter.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1147448) Up to a point, he was right.\nEvery new medium transforms the nature of human thought. In the long run,\nhistory is the story of information becoming aware of itself.\n\nSome information technologies were appreciated in their own time, but others\nwere not. One that was sorely misunderstood was the African talking drum.\n\n* * *\n\n* And added drily: “In this role, electronic man is no less a nomad than his Paleolithic ancestors.”\n\n\n# 1 | DRUMS THAT TALK\n\n\n##\n\n> (When a Code Is Not a Code)\n\n> _Across the Dark Continent sound the never-silent drums: the base of all the\n> music, the focus of every dance; the talking drums, the wireless of the\n> unmapped jungle._\n\n> —Irma Wassall (1943)[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1147810)\n\nNO ONE SPOKE SIMPLY ON THE DRUMS. Drummers would not say, “Come back home,”\nbut rather,\n\n> Make your feet come back the way they went,\n>\n> make your legs come back the way they went,\n>\n> plant your feet and your legs below,\n>\n> in the village which belongs to us.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1148068)\n\nThey could not just say “corpse” but would elaborate: “which lies on its back\non clods of earth.” Instead of “don’t be afraid,” they would say, “Bring your\nheart back down out of your mouth, your heart out of your mouth, get it back\ndown from there.” The drums generated fountains of oratory. This seemed\ninefficient. Was it grandiloquence or bombast? Or something else?\n\nFor a long time Europeans in sub-Saharan Africa had no idea. In fact they had\nno idea that the drums conveyed information at all. In their own cultures, in\nspecial cases a drum could be an instrument of signaling, along with the bugle\nand the bell, used to transmit a small set of messages: _attack;retreat; come\nto church_. But they could not conceive of talking drums. In 1730 Francis\nMoore sailed eastward up the Gambia River, finding it navigable for six\nhundred miles, all the way admiring the beauty of the country and such curious\nwonders as “oysters that grew upon trees”\n(mangroves).[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1148336) He was not much of a\nnaturalist. He was reconnoitering as an agent for English slavers in kingdoms\ninhabited, as he saw it, by different races of people of black or tawny\ncolors, “as Mundingoes, Jolloiffs, Pholeys, Floops, and Portuguese.” When he\ncame upon men and women carrying drums, carved wood as much as a yard long,\ntapered from top to bottom, he noted that women danced briskly to their music,\nand sometimes that the drums were “beat on the approach of an enemy,” and\nfinally, “on some very extraordinary occasions,” that the drums summoned help\nfrom neighboring towns. But that was all he noticed.\n\nA century later, Captain William Allen, on an expedition to the Niger River,*\nmade a further discovery, by virtue of paying attention to his Cameroon pilot,\nwhom he called Glasgow. They were in the cabin of the iron paddle ship when,\nas Allen recalled:\n\n> > Suddenly he became totally abstracted, and remained for a while in the\n> attitude of listening. On being taxed with inattention, he said, “You no\n> hear my son speak?” As we had heard no voice, he was asked how he knew it.\n> He said, “Drum speak me, tell me come up deck.” This seemed to be very\n> singular.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1148590)\n\nThe captain’s skepticism gave way to amazement, as Glasgow convinced him that\nevery village had this “facility of musical correspondence.” Hard though it\nwas to believe, the captain finally accepted that detailed messages of many\nsentences could be conveyed across miles. “We are often surprised,” he wrote,\n“to find the sound of the trumpet so well understood in our military\nevolutions; but how far short that falls of the result arrived at by those\nuntutored savages.” That result was a technology much sought in Europe: long-\ndistance communication faster than any traveler on foot or horseback. Through\nthe still night air over a river, the thump of the drum could carry six or\nseven miles. Relayed from village to village, messages could rumble a hundred\nmiles or more in a matter of an hour.\n\nA birth announcement in Bolenge, a village of the Belgian Congo, went like\nthis:\n\n> > _Batoko fala fala, tokema bolo bolo, boseka woliana imaki tonkilingonda,\n> ale nda bobila wa fole fole, asokoka l’isika koke koke_.\n>\n\n>> The mats are rolled up, we feel strong, a woman came from the forest, she\nis in the open village, that is enough for this time.\n\nA missionary, Roger T. Clarke, transcribed this call to a fisherman’s\nfuneral:[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1148924)\n\n> > _La nkesa laa mpombolo, tofolange benteke biesala, tolanga bonteke\n> bolokolo bole nda elinga l’enjale baenga, basaki l’okala bopele pele.\n> Bojende bosalaki lifeta Bolenge wa kala kala, tekendake tonkilingonda,\n> tekendake beningo la nkaka elinga l’enjale. Tolanga bonteke bolokolo bole\n> nda elinga l’enjale, la nkesa la mpombolo_.\n>\n\n>> In the morning at dawn, we do not want gatherings for work, we want a\nmeeting of play on the river. Men who live in Bolenge, do not go to the\nforest, do not go fishing. We want a meeting of play on the river, in the\nmorning at dawn.\n\nClarke noted several facts. While only some people learned to communicate by\ndrum, almost anyone could understand the messages in the drumbeats. Some\npeople drummed rapidly and some slowly. Set phrases would recur again and\nagain, virtually unchanged, yet different drummers would send the same message\nwith different wording. Clarke decided that the drum language was at once\nformulaic and fluid. “The signals represent the tones of the syllables of\nconventional phrases of a traditional and highly poetic character,” he\nconcluded, and this was correct, but he could not take the last step toward\nunderstanding why.\n\nThese Europeans spoke of “the native mind” and described Africans as\n“primitive” and “animistic” and nonetheless came to see that they had achieved\nan ancient dream of every human culture. Here was a messaging system that\noutpaced the best couriers, the fastest horses on good roads with way stations\nand relays. Earth-bound, foot-based messaging systems always disappointed.\nTheir armies outran them. Julius Caesar, for example, was “very often arriving\nbefore the messengers sent to announce his\ncoming,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1149224) as Suetonius reported in the\nfirst century. The ancients were not without resources, however. The Greeks\nused fire beacons at the time of the Trojan War, in the twelfth century BCE,\nby all accounts—that is, those of Homer, Virgil, and Aeschylus. A bonfire on a\nmountaintop could be seen from watchtowers twenty miles distant, or in special\ncases even farther. In the Aeschylus version, Clytemnestra gets the news of\nthe fall of Troy that very night, four hundred miles away in Mycenae. “Yet who\nso swift could speed the message here?”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1149547)\nthe skeptical Chorus asks.\n\nShe credits Hephaestus, god of fire: “Sent forth his sign; and on, and ever\non, beacon to beacon sped the courier-flame.” This is no small accomplishment,\nand the listener needs convincing, so Aeschylus has Clytemnestra continue for\nseveral minutes with every detail of the route: the blazing signal rose from\nMount Ida, carried across the northern Aegean Sea to the island of Lemnos;\nfrom there to Mount Athos in Macedonia; then southward across plains and lakes\nto Macistus; Messapius, where the watcher “saw the far flame gleam on Euripus’\ntide, and from the high-piled heap of withered furze lit the new sign and bade\nthe message on”; Cithaeron; Aegiplanetus; and her own town’s mountain watch,\nArachne. “So sped from stage to stage, fulfilled in turn, flame after flame,”\nshe boasts, “along the course ordained.” A German historian, Richard Hennig,\ntraced and measured the route in 1908 and confirmed the feasibility of this\nchain of bonfires.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1149792) The meaning of the\nmessage had, of course, to be prearranged, effectively condensed into a single\nbit. A binary choice, _something_ or _nothing:_ the fire signal meant\n_something_ , which, just this once, meant “Troy has fallen.” To transmit this\none bit required immense planning, labor, watchfulness, and firewood. Many\nyears later, lanterns in Old North Church likewise sent Paul Revere a single\nprecious bit, which he carried onward, one binary choice: by land or by sea.\n\nMore capacity was required, for less extraordinary occasions. People tried\nflags, horns, intermitting smoke, and flashing mirrors. They conjured spirits\nand angels for purposes of communication—angels being divine messengers, by\ndefinition. The discovery of magnetism held particular promise. In a world\nalready suffused with magic, magnets embodied occult powers. The lodestone\nattracts iron. This power of attraction extends invisibly through the air. Nor\nis it interrupted by water or even solid bodies. A lodestone held on one side\nof a wall can move a piece of iron on the other side. Most intriguing, the\nmagnetic power appears able to coordinate objects vast distances apart, across\nthe whole earth: namely, compass needles. What if one needle could control\nanother? This idea spread—a “conceit,” Thomas Browne wrote in the 1640s,\n\n> > whispered thorow the world with some attention, credulous and vulgar\n> auditors readily believing it, and more judicious and distinctive heads, not\n> altogether rejecting it. The conceit is excellent, and if the effect would\n> follow, somewhat divine; whereby we might communicate like spirits, and\n> confer on earth with Menippus in the\n> Moon.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1150094)\n\nThe idea of “sympathetic” needles appeared wherever there were natural\nphilosophers and confidence artists. In Italy a man tried to sell Galileo “a\nsecret method of communicating with a person two or three thousand miles away,\nby means of a certain sympathy of magnetic\nneedles.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1150460)\n\n> > I told him that I would gladly buy, but wanted to see by experiment and\n> that it would be enough for me if he would stand in one room and I in\n> another. He replied that its operation could not be detected at such a short\n> distance. I sent him on his way, with the remark that I was not in the mood\n> at that time to go to Cairo or Moscow for the experiment, but that if he\n> wanted to go I would stay in Venice and take care of the other end.\n\nThe idea was that if a pair of needles were magnetized together—“touched with\nthe same Loadstone,” as Browne put it—they would remain in sympathy from then\non, even when separated by distance. One might call this “entanglement.” A\nsender and a recipient would take the needles and agree on a time to\ncommunicate. They would place their needle in disks with the letters of the\nalphabet spaced around the rim. The sender would spell out a message by\nturning the needle. “For then, saith tradition,” Browne explained, “at what\ndistance of place soever, when one needle shall be removed unto any letter,\nthe other by a wonderfull sympathy will move unto the same.” Unlike most\npeople who considered the idea of sympathetic needles, however, Browne\nactually tried the experiment. It did not work. When he turned one needle, the\nother stood still.\n\nBrowne did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that this mysterious\nforce could someday be used for communication, but he added one more caveat.\nEven if magnetic communication at a distance was possible, he suggested, a\nproblem might arise when sender and receiver tried to synchronize their\nactions. How would they know the time,\n\n> > it being no ordinary or Almanack business, but a probleme Mathematical, to\n> finde out the difference of hours in different places; nor do the wisest\n> exactly satisfy themselves in all. For the hours of several places\n> anticipate each other, according to their Longitudes; which are not exactly\n> discovered of every place.\n\nThis was a prescient thought, and entirely theoretical, a product of new\nseventeenth-century knowledge of astronomy and geography. It was the first\ncrack in the hitherto solid assumption of simultaneity. Anyway, as Browne\nnoted, experts differed. Two more centuries would pass before anyone could\nactually travel fast enough, or communicate fast enough, to experience local\ntime differences. For now, in fact, no one in the world could communicate as\nmuch, as fast, as far as unlettered Africans with their drums.\n\nBy the time Captain Allen discovered the talking drums in 1841, Samuel F. B.\nMorse was struggling with his own percussive code, the electromagnetic\ndrumbeat designed to pulse along the telegraph wire. Inventing a code was a\ncomplex and delicate problem. He did not even think in terms of a code, at\nfirst, but “a system of signs for letters, to be indicated and marked by a\nquick succession of strokes or shocks of the galvanic\ncurrent.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1150810) The annals of invention\noffered scarcely any precedent. How to convert information from one form, the\neveryday language, into another form suitable for transmission by wire taxed\nhis ingenuity more than any mechanical problem of the telegraph. It is fitting\nthat history attached Morse’s name to his code, more than to his device.\n\nHe had at hand a technology that seemed to allow only crude pulses, bursts of\ncurrent on and off, an electrical circuit closing and opening. How could he\nconvey language through the clicking of an electromagnet? His first idea was\nto send numbers, a digit at a time, with dots and pauses. The sequence ••• ••\n••••• would mean 325. Every English word would be assigned a number, and the\ntelegraphists at each end of the line would look them up in a special\ndictionary. Morse set about creating this dictionary himself, wasting many\nhours inscribing it on large folios.*[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1151334)\nHe claimed the idea in his first telegraph patent, in 1840:\n\n> > The dictionary or vocabulary consists of words alphabetically arranged and\n> regularly numbered, beginning with the letters of the alphabet, so that each\n> word in the language has its telegraphic number, and is designated at\n> pleasure, through the signs of\n> numerals.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1151107)\n\nSeeking efficiency, he weighed the costs and possibilities across several\nintersecting planes. There was the cost of transmission itself: the wires\nwould be expensive and would convey only so many pulses per minute. Numbers\nwould be relatively easy to transmit. But then there was the extra cost in\ntime and difficulty for the telegraphists. The idea of code books—lookup\ntables—still had possibilities, and it echoed into the future, arising again\nin other technologies. Eventually it worked for Chinese telegraphy. But Morse\nrealized that it would be hopelessly cumbersome for operators to page through\na dictionary for every word.\n\nHis protégé Alfred Vail, meanwhile, was developing a simple lever key by which\nan operator could rapidly close and open the electric circuit. Vail and Morse\nturned to the idea of a coded alphabet, using signs as surrogates for the\nletters and thus spelling out every word. Somehow the bare signs would have to\nstand in for all the words of the spoken or written language. They had to map\nthe entire language onto a single dimension of pulses. At first they conceived\nof a system built on two elements: the clicks (now called dots) and the spaces\nin between. Then, as they fiddled with the prototype keypad, they came up with\na third sign: the line or dash, “when the circuit was closed a longer time\nthan was necessary to make a dot.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1151634) (The\ncode became known as the dot-and-dash alphabet, but the unmentioned space\nremained just as important; Morse code was not a binary language.*) That\nhumans could learn this new language was, at first, wondrous. They would have\nto master the coding system and then perform a continuous act of double\ntranslation: language to signs; mind to fingers. One witness was amazed at how\nthe telegraphists internalized these skills:\n\n> > The clerks who attend at the recording instrument become so expert in\n> their curious hieroglyphics, that they do not need to look at the printed\n> record to know what the message under reception is; the recording instrument\n> has for them an intelligible articulate language. They understand _its\n> speech_. They can close their eyes and listen to the strange clicking that\n> is going on close to their ear whilst the printing is in progress, and at\n> once say what it all means.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1151831)\n\nIn the name of speed, Morse and Vail had realized that they could save strokes\nby reserving the shorter sequences of dots and dashes for the most common\nletters. But which letters would be used most often? Little was known about\nthe alphabet’s statistics. In search of data on the letters’ relative\nfrequencies, Vail was inspired to visit the local newspaper office in\nMorristown, New Jersey, and look over the type\ncases.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1152109) He found a stock of twelve\nthousand E’s, nine thousand T’s, and only two hundred Z’s. He and Morse\nrearranged the alphabet accordingly. They had originally used dash-dash-dot to\nrepresent T, the second most common letter; now they promoted T to a single\ndash, thus saving telegraph operators uncountable billions of key taps in the\nworld to come. Long afterward, information theorists calculated that they had\ncome within 15 percent of an optimal arrangement for telegraphing English\ntext.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1152787)\n\nNo such science, no such pragmatism informed the language of the drums. Yet\nthere had been a problem to solve, just as there was in the design of a code\nfor telegraphers: how to map an entire language onto a one-dimensional stream\nof the barest sounds. This design problem was solved collectively by\ngenerations of drummers in a centuries-long process of social evolution. By\nthe early twentieth century the analogy to the telegraph was apparent to\nEuropeans studying Africa. “Only a few days ago I read in the _Times_ ,”\nCaptain Robert Sutherland Rattray reported to the Royal African Society in\nLondon, “how a resident in one part of Africa heard of the death—in another\nand far remote part of the continent—of a European baby, and how this news was\ncarried by means of drums, which were used, it was stated, ‘on the Morse\nprinciple’—it is always ‘the Morse\nprinciple.’”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1153094)\n\nBut the obvious analogy led people astray. They failed to decipher the code of\nthe drums because, in effect, there was no code. Morse had bootstrapped his\nsystem from a middle symbolic layer, the written alphabet, intermediate\nbetween speech and his final code. His dots and dashes had no direct\nconnection to sound; they represented letters, which formed written words,\nwhich represented the spoken words in turn. The drummers could not build on an\nintermediate code—they could not abstract through a layer of symbols—because\nthe African languages, like all but a few dozen of the six thousand languages\nspoken in the modern world, lacked an alphabet. The drums metamorphosed\nspeech.\n\nIt fell to John F. Carrington to explain. An English missionary, born in 1914\nin Northamptonshire, Carrington left for Africa at the age of twenty-four and\nAfrica became his lifetime home. The drums caught his attention early, as he\ntraveled from the Baptist Missionary Society station in Yakusu, on the Upper\nCongo River, through the villages of the Bambole forest. One day he made an\nimpromptu trip to the small town of Yaongama and was surprised to find a\nteacher, medical assistant, and church members already assembled for his\narrival. They had heard the drums, they explained. Eventually he realized that\nthe drums conveyed not just announcements and warnings but prayers, poetry,\nand even jokes. The drummers were not signaling but talking: they spoke a\nspecial, adapted language.\n\nEventually Carrington himself learned to drum. He drummed mainly in Kele, a\nlanguage of the Bantu family in what is now eastern Zaire. “He is not really a\nEuropean, despite the color of his\nskin,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1153478) a Lokele villager said of\nCarrington. “He used to be from our village, one of us. After he died, the\nspirits made a mistake and sent him off far away to a village of whites to\nenter into the body of a little baby who was born of a white woman instead of\none of ours. But because he belongs to us, he could not forget where he came\nfrom and so he came back.” The villager added generously, “If he is a bit\nawkward on the drums, this is because of the poor education that the whites\ngave him.” Carrington’s life in Africa spanned four decades. He became an\naccomplished botanist, anthropologist, and above all linguist, authoritative\non the structure of African language families: thousands of dialects and\nseveral hundred distinct languages. He noticed how loquacious a good drummer\nhad to be. He finally published his discoveries about drums in 1949, in a slim\nvolume titled _The Talking Drums of Africa_.\n\nIn solving the enigma of the drums, Carrington found the key in a central fact\nabout the relevant African languages. They are tonal languages, in which\nmeaning is determined as much by rising or falling pitch contours as by\ndistinctions between consonants or vowels. This feature is missing from most\nIndo-European languages, including English, which uses tone only in limited,\nsyntactical ways: for example, to distinguish questions (“you are happy\n![](images/00004.jpg)”) from declarations (“you are happy\n![](images/00005.jpg)”). But for other languages, including, most famously,\nMandarin and Cantonese, tone has primary significance in distinguishing words.\nSo it does in most African languages. Even when Europeans learned to\ncommunicate in these languages, they generally failed to grasp the importance\nof tonality, because they had no experience with it. When they transliterated\nthe words they heard into the Latin alphabet, they disregarded pitch\naltogether. In effect, they were color-blind.\n\nThree different Kele words are transliterated by Europeans as _lisaka_. The\nwords are distinguished only by their speech-tones. Thus _lisaka_ with three\nlow syllables is a puddle; _lisa ka_, the last syllable rising (not\nnecessarily stressed) is a promise; and _li saka_ is a poison. _Li ala_ means\nfiancée and _liala_ , rubbish pit. In transliteration they appear to be\nhomonyms, but they are not. Carrington, after the light dawned, recalled, “I\nmust have been guilty many a time of asking a boy to ‘paddle for a book’ or to\n‘fish that his friend is coming.’ ”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1153898)\nEuropeans just lacked the ear for the distinctions. Carrington saw how comical\nthe confusion could become:\n\n> > _alambaka boili_ [– _ – – _ _ _] = he watched the riverbank\n>\n\n>> _alambaka boili_ [– – – – _ – _] = he boiled his mother-in-law\n\nSince the late nineteenth century, linguists have identified the phoneme as\nthe smallest acoustic unit that makes a difference in meaning. The English\nword _chuck_ comprises three phonemes: different meanings can be created by\nchanging _ch_ to _d_ , or _u_ to _e_ , or _ck_ to _m_. It is a useful concept\nbut an imperfect one: linguists have found it surprisingly difficult to agree\non an exact inventory of phonemes for English or any other language (most\nestimates for English are in the vicinity of forty-five). The problem is that\na stream of speech is a continuum; a linguist may abstractly, and arbitrarily,\nbreak it into discrete units, but the meaningfulness of these units varies\nfrom speaker to speaker and depends on the context. Most speakers’ instincts\nabout phonemes are biased, too, by their knowledge of the written alphabet,\nwhich codifies language in its own sometimes arbitrary ways. In any case,\ntonal languages, with their extra variable, contain many more phonemes than\nwere first apparent to inexperienced linguists.\n\nAs the spoken languages of Africa elevated tonality to a crucial role, the\ndrum language went a difficult step further. It employed tone and only tone.\nIt was a language of a single pair of phonemes, a language composed entirely\nof pitch contours. The drums varied in materials and craft. Some were slit\ngongs, tubes of padauk wood, hollow, cut with a long and narrow mouth to make\na high-sounding lip and a low-sounding lip; others had skin tops, and these\nwere used in pairs. All that mattered was for the drums to sound two distinct\nnotes, at an interval of about a major third.\n\nSo in mapping the spoken language to the drum language, information was lost.\nThe drum talk was speech with a deficit. For every village and every tribe,\nthe drum language began with the spoken word and shed the consonants and\nvowels. That was a lot to lose. The remaining information stream would be\nriddled with ambiguity. A double stroke on the high-tone lip of the drum [– –]\nmatched the tonal pattern of the Kele word for father, _sango_ , but naturally\nit could just as well be _songe_ , the moon; _koko_ , fowl; _fele_ , a species\nof fish; or any other word of two high tones. Even the limited dictionary of\nthe missionaries at Yakusu contained 130 such\nwords.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1154172) Having reduced spoken words, in\nall their sonic richness, to such a minimal code, how could the drums\ndistinguish them? The answer lay partly in stress and timing, but these could\nnot compensate for the lack of consonants and vowels. Thus, Carrington\ndiscovered, a drummer would invariably add “a little phrase” to each short\nword. _Songe_ , the moon, is rendered as _songe li tange la manga—_ “the moon\nlooks down at the earth.” _Koko_ , the fowl, is rendered _koko olongo la\nbokiokio—_ “the fowl, the little one that says kiokio.” The extra drumbeats,\nfar from being extraneous, provide context. Every ambiguous word begins in a\ncloud of possible alternative interpretations; then the unwanted possibilities\nevaporate. This takes place below the level of consciousness. Listeners are\nhearing only staccato drum tones, low and high, but in effect they “hear” the\nmissing consonants and vowels, too. For that matter, they hear whole phrases,\nnot individual words. “Among peoples who know nothing of writing or grammar, a\nword _per se_ , cut out of its sound group, seems almost to cease to be an\nintelligible articulation,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1154359) Captain\nRattray reported.\n\nThe stereotyped long tails flap along, their redundancy overcoming ambiguity.\nThe drum language is creative, freely generating neologisms for innovations\nfrom the north: steamboats, cigarettes, and the Christian god being three that\nCarrington particularly noted. But drummers begin by learning the traditional\nfixed formulas. Indeed, the formulas of the African drummers sometimes\npreserve archaic words that have been forgotten in the everyday language. For\nthe Yaunde, the elephant is always “the great awkward\none.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1154700) The resemblance to Homeric\nformulas—not merely Zeus, but Zeus the cloud-gatherer; not just the sea, but\nthe wine-dark sea—is no accident. In an oral culture, inspiration has to serve\nclarity and memory first. The Muses are the daughters of Mnemosyne.\n\nNeither Kele nor English yet had words to say, _allocate extra bits for\ndisambiguation and error correction_. Yet this is what the drum language did.\nRedundancy—inefficient by definition—serves as the antidote to confusion. It\nprovides second chances. Every natural language has redundancy built in; this\nis why people can understand text riddled with errors and why they can\nunderstand conversation in a noisy room. The natural redundancy of English\nmotivates the famous New York City subway poster of the 1970s (and the poem by\nJames Merrill),\n\n> if u cn rd ths\n>\n> u cn gt a gd jb w hi pa!\n\n(“This counterspell may save your\nsoul,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1155016) Merrill adds.) Most of the time,\nredundancy in language is just part of the background. For a telegraphist it\nis an expensive waste. For an African drummer it is essential. Another\nspecialized language provides a perfect analog: the language of aviation\nradio. Numbers and letters make up much of the information passed between\npilots and air traffic controllers: altitudes, vectors, aircraft tail numbers,\nrunway and taxiway identifiers, radio frequencies. This is critical\ncommunication over a notoriously noisy channel, so a specialized alphabet is\nemployed to minimize ambiguity. The spoken letters _B_ and _V_ are easy to\nconfuse; _bravo_ and _victor_ are safer. _M_ and _N_ become _mike_ and\n_november_. In the case of numbers, _five_ and _nine_ , particularly prone to\nconfusion, are spoken as _fife_ and _niner_. The extra syllables perform the\nsame function as the extra verbosity of the talking drums.\n\nAfter publishing his book, John Carrington came across a mathematical way to\nunderstand this point. A paper by a Bell Labs telephone engineer, Ralph\nHartley, even had a relevant-looking formula: _H_ = _n_ log _s_ , where _H_ is\nthe amount of information, _n_ is the number of symbols in the message, and\n_s_ is the number of symbols available in the\nlanguage.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1155296) Hartley’s younger colleague\nClaude Shannon later pursued this lead, and one of his touchstone projects\nbecame a precise measurement of the redundancy in English. Symbols could be\nwords, phonemes, or dots and dashes. The degree of choice within a symbol set\nvaried—a thousand words or forty-five phonemes or twenty-six letters or three\ntypes of interruption in an electrical circuit. The formula quantified a\nsimple enough phenomenon (simple, anyway, once it was noticed): the fewer\nsymbols available, the more of them must be transmitted to get across a given\namount of information. For the African drummers, messages need to be about\neight times as long as their spoken equivalents.\n\nHartley took some pains to justify his use of the word _information_. “As\ncommonly used, information is a very elastic term,” he wrote, “and it will\nfirst be necessary to set up for it a more specific meaning.” He proposed to\nthink of information “physically”—his word—rather than psychologically. He\nfound the complications multiplying. Somewhat paradoxically, the complexity\narose from the intermediate layers of symbols: letters of the alphabet, or\ndots and dashes, which were discrete and therefore easily countable in\nthemselves. Harder to measure were the connections between these stand-ins and\nthe bottom layer: the human voice itself. It was this stream of meaningful\nsound that still seemed, to a telephone engineer as much as an African\ndrummer, the real stuff of communication, even if the sound, in turn, served\nas a code for the knowledge or meaning below. In any case Hartley thought an\nengineer should be able to generalize over all cases of communication: writing\nand telegraph codes as well as the physical transmission of sound by means of\nelectromagnetic waves along telephone wires or through the ether.\n\nHe knew nothing of the drums, of course. And no sooner did John Carrington\ncome to understand them than they began to fade from the African scene. He saw\nLokele youth practicing the drums less and less, schoolboys who did not even\nlearn their own drum names.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1155596) He\nregretted it. He had made the talking drums a part of his own life. In 1954 a\nvisitor from the United States found him running a mission school in the\nCongolese outpost of Yalemba.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1155841)\nCarrington still walked daily in the jungle, and when it was time for lunch\nhis wife would summon him with a fast tattoo. She drummed: “White man spirit\nin forest come come to house of shingles high up above of white man spirit in\nforest. Woman with yams awaits. Come come.”\n\nBefore long, there were people for whom the path of communications technology\nhad leapt directly from the talking drum to the mobile phone, skipping over\nthe intermediate stages.\n\n* * *\n\n* The trip was sponsored by the Society for the Extinction of the Slave Trade and the Civilization of Africa for the purpose of interfering with slavers.\n\n* “A very short experience, however, showed the superiority of the alphabetic mode,” he wrote later, “and the big leaves of the numbered dictionary, which cost me a world of labor,… were discarded and the alphabetic installed in its stead.”\n\n* Operators soon distinguished spaces of different lengths—intercharacter and interword—so Morse code actually employed four signs.\n\n\n# 2 | THE PERSISTENCE OF THE WORD\n\n\n##\n\n> (There Is No Dictionary in the Mind)\n\n> _Odysseus wept when he heard the poet sing of his great deeds abroad\n> because, once sung, they were no longer his alone. They belonged to anyone\n> who heard the song._\n\n> —Ward Just (2004)[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1156200)\n\n“TRY TO IMAGINE,” proposed Walter J. Ong, Jesuit priest, philosopher, and\ncultural historian, “a culture where no one has ever ‘looked up’\nanything.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1156439) To subtract the technologies\nof information internalized over two millennia requires a leap of imagination\nbackward into a forgotten past. The hardest technology to erase from our minds\nis the first of all: writing. This arises at the very dawn of history, as it\nmust, because the history begins with the writing. The pastness of the past\ndepends on it.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1156703)\n\nIt takes a few thousand years for this mapping of language onto a system of\nsigns to become second nature, and then there is no return to naïveté.\nForgotten is the time when our very awareness of words came from _seeing_\nthem. “In a primary oral culture,” as Ong noted,\n\n> > the expression “to look up something” is an empty phrase: it would have no\n> conceivable meaning. Without writing, words as such have no visual presence,\n> even when the objects they represent are visual. They are sounds. You might\n> “call” them back—“recall” them. But there is nowhere to “look” for them.\n> They have no focus and no trace.\n\nIn the 1960s and ’70s, Ong declared the electronic age to be a new age of\norality—but of “secondary orality,” the spoken word amplified and extended as\nnever before, but always in the context of literacy: voices heard against a\nbackground of ubiquitous print. The first age of orality had lasted quite a\nbit longer. It covered almost the entire lifetime of the species, writing\nbeing a late development, general literacy being almost an afterthought. Like\nMarshall McLuhan, with whom he was often compared (“the other eminent\nCatholic-electronic prophet,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1157010) said a\nscornful Frank Kermode), Ong had the misfortune to make his visionary\nassessments of a new age just before it actually arrived. The new media seemed\nto be radio, telephone, and television. But these were just the faint\nglimmerings in the night sky, signaling the light that still lay just beyond\nthe horizon. Whether Ong would have seen cyberspace as fundamentally oral or\nliterary, he would surely have recognized it as transformative: not just a\nrevitalization of older forms, not just an amplification, but something wholly\nnew. He might have sensed a coming discontinuity akin to the emergence of\nliteracy itself. Few understood better than Ong just how profound a\ndiscontinuity that had been.\n\nWhen he began his studies, “oral literature” was a common phrase. It is an\noxymoron laced with anachronism; the words imply an all-too-unconscious\napproach to the past by way of the present. Oral literature was generally\ntreated as a variant of writing; this, Ong said, was “rather like thinking of\nhorses as automobiles without wheels.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1157302)\n\n> > You can, of course, undertake to do this. Imagine writing a treatise on\n> horses (for people who have never seen a horse) which starts with the\n> concept not of “horse” but of “automobile,” built on the readers’ direct\n> experience of automobiles. It proceeds to discourse on horses by always\n> referring to them as “wheelless automobiles,” explaining to highly\n> automobilized readers all the points of difference.… Instead of wheels, the\n> wheelless automobiles have enlarged toenails called hooves; instead of\n> headlights, eyes; instead of a coat of lacquer, something called hair;\n> instead of gasoline for fuel, hay, and so on. In the end, horses are only\n> what they are not.\n\nWhen it comes to understanding the preliterate past, we modern folk are\nhopelessly automobilized. The written word is the mechanism by which we know\nwhat we know. It organizes our thought. We may wish to understand the rise of\nliteracy both historically and logically, but history and logic are themselves\nthe products of literate thought.\n\nWriting, as a technology, requires premeditation and special art. Language is\nnot a technology, no matter how well developed and efficacious. It is not best\nseen as something separate from the mind; it is what the mind does. “Language\nin fact bears the same relationship to the concept of mind that legislation\nbears to the concept of parliament,” says Jonathan Miller: “it is a competence\nforever bodying itself in a series of concrete\nperformances.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1157532) Much the same might be\nsaid of writing—it is concrete performance—but when the word is instantiated\nin paper or stone, it takes on a separate existence as artifice. It is a\nproduct of tools, and it is a tool. And like many technologies that followed,\nit thereby inspired immediate detractors.\n\nOne unlikely Luddite was also one of the first long-term beneficiaries. Plato\n(channeling the nonwriter Socrates) warned that this technology meant\nimpoverishment:\n\n> > For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who\n> learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in\n> writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves,\n> will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented\n> an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the\n> appearance of wisdom, not true\n> wisdom.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1157794)\n\n_External characters which are no part of themselves_ —this was the trouble.\nThe written word seemed insincere. Ersatz scratchings on papyrus or clay were\nfar abstracted from the real, the free-flowing sound of language, intimately\nbound up with thought so as to seem coterminous with it. Writing appeared to\ndraw knowledge away from the person, to place their memories in storage. It\nalso separated the speaker from the listener, by so many miles or years. The\ndeepest consequences of writing, for the individual and for the culture, could\nhardly have been foreseen, but even Plato could see some of the power of this\ndisconnection. The one speaks to the multitude. The dead speak to the living,\nthe living to the unborn. As McLuhan said, “Two thousand years of manuscript\nculture lay ahead of the Western world when Plato made this\nobservation.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1158084) The power of this first\nartificial memory was incalculable: to restructure thought, to engender\nhistory. It is still incalculable, though one statistic gives a hint: whereas\nthe total vocabulary of any oral language measures a few thousand words, the\nsingle language that has been written most widely, English, has a documented\nvocabulary of well over a million words, a corpus that grows by thousands of\nwords a year. These words do not exist only in the present. Each word has a\nprovenance and a history that melts into its present life.\n\nWith words we begin to leave traces behind us like breadcrumbs: memories in\nsymbols for others to follow. Ants deploy their pheromones, trails of chemical\ninformation; Theseus unwound Ariadne’s thread. Now people leave paper trails.\nWriting comes into being to retain information across time and across space.\nBefore writing, communication is evanescent and local; sounds carry a few\nyards and fade to oblivion. The evanescence of the spoken word went without\nsaying. So fleeting was speech that the rare phenomenon of the echo, a sound\nheard once and then again, seemed a sort of magic. “This miraculous rebounding\nof the voice, the Greeks have a pretty name for, and call it\nEcho,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1158433) wrote Pliny. “The spoken\nsymbol,” as Samuel Butler observed, “perishes instantly without material\ntrace, and if it lives at all does so only in the minds of those who heard\nit.” Butler was able to formulate this truth just as it was being falsified\nfor the first time, at the end of the nineteenth century, by the arrival of\nthe electric technologies for capturing speech. It was precisely because it\nwas no longer completely true that it could be clearly seen. Butler completed\nthe distinction: “The written symbol extends infinitely, as regards time and\nspace, the range within which one mind can communicate with another; it gives\nthe writer’s mind a life limited by the duration of ink, paper, and readers,\nas against that of his flesh and blood\nbody.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1158722)\n\nBut the new channel does more than extend the previous channel. It enables\nreuse and “re-collection”—new modes. It permits whole new architectures of\ninformation. Among them are history, law, business, mathematics, and logic.\nApart from their content, these categories represent new techniques. The power\nlies not just in the knowledge, preserved and passed forward, valuable as it\nis, but in the methodology: encoded visual indications, the act of\ntransference, substituting signs for things. And then, later, signs for signs.\n\nPaleolithic people began at least 30,000 years ago to scratch and paint shapes\nthat recalled to the eye images of horses, fishes, and hunters. These signs in\nclay and on cave walls served purposes of art or magic, and historians are\nloath to call them writing, but they began the recording of mental states in\nexternal media. In another way, knots in cords and notches in sticks served as\naids to memory. These could be carried as messages. Marks in pottery and\nmasonry could signify ownership. Marks, images, pictographs, petroglyphs—as\nthese forms grew stylized, conventional, and thus increasingly abstract, they\napproached what we understand as writing, but one more transition was crucial,\nfrom the representation of things to the representation of spoken language:\nthat is, representation twice removed. There is a progression from\npictographic, _writing the picture;_ to ideographic, _writing the idea;_ and\nthen logographic, _writing the word_.\n\nChinese script began this transition between 4,500 and 8,000 years ago: signs\nthat began as pictures came to represent meaningful units of sound. Because\nthe basic unit was the word, thousands of distinct symbols were required. This\nis efficient in one way, inefficient in another. Chinese unifies an array of\ndistinct spoken languages: people who cannot speak to one another can write to\none another. It employs at least fifty thousand symbols, about six thousand\ncommonly used and known to most literate Chinese. In swift diagrammatic\nstrokes they encode multidimensional semantic relationships. One device is\nsimple repetition: _tree_ \\+ _tree_ \\+ _tree_ = _forest;_ more abstractly,\n_sun_ \\+ _moon_ = _brightness_ and _east_ \\+ _east_ = _everywhere_. The\nprocess of compounding creates surprises: _grain_ \\+ _knife_ = _profit; hand_\n\\+ _eye_ = _look_. Characters can be transformed in meaning by reorienting\ntheir elements: _child_ to _childbirth_ and _man_ to _corpse_. Some elements\nare phonetic; some even punning. The entirety is the richest and most complex\nwriting system that humanity has ever evolved. Considering scripts in terms of\nhow many symbols are required and how much meaning each individual symbol\nconveys, Chinese thus became an extreme case: the largest set of symbols, and\nthe most meaningful individually. Writing systems could take alternative\npaths: fewer symbols, each carrying less information. An intermediate stage is\nthe syllabary, a phonetic writing system using individual characters to\nrepresent syllables, which may or may not be meaningful. A few hundred\ncharacters can serve a language.\n\nThe writing system at the opposite extreme took the longest to emerge: the\nalphabet, one symbol for one minimal sound. The alphabet is the most\nreductive, the most subversive of all scripts.\n\nIn all the languages of earth there is only one word for _alphabet_ (_alfabet_\n, _alfabeto_ , ![](images/00006.jpg)). The alphabet was invented only once.\nAll known alphabets, used today or found buried on tablets and stone, descend\nfrom the same original ancestor, which arose near the eastern littoral of the\nMediterranean Sea, sometime not much before 1500 BCE, in a region that became\na politically unstable crossroads of culture, covering Palestine, Phoenicia,\nand Assyria. To the east lay the great civilization of Mesopotamia, with its\ncuneiform script already a millennium old; down the shoreline to the southwest\nlay Egypt, where hieroglyphics developed simultaneously and independently.\nTraders traveled, too, from Cyprus and Crete, bringing their own incompatible\nsystems. With glyphs from Minoan, Hittite, and Anatolian, it made for a\nsymbolic stew. The ruling priestly classes were invested in their writing\nsystems. Whoever owned the scripts owned the laws and the rites. But self-\npreservation had to compete with the desire for rapid communication. The\nscripts were conservative; the new technology was pragmatic. A stripped-down\nsymbol system, just twenty-two signs, was the innovation of Semitic peoples in\nor near Palestine. Scholars naturally look to Kiriath-sepher, translatable as\n“city of the book,” and Byblos, “city of papyrus,” but no one knows exactly,\nand no one can know. The paleographer has a unique bootstrap problem. It is\nonly writing that makes its own history possible. The foremost twentieth-\ncentury authority on the alphabet, David Diringer, quoted an earlier scholar:\n“There never was a man who could sit down and say: ‘Now I am going to be the\nfirst man to write.’ ”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1159013)\n\nThe alphabet spread by contagion. The new technology was both the virus and\nthe vector of transmission. It could not be monopolized, and it could not be\nsuppressed. Even children could learn these few, lightweight, semantically\nempty letters. Divergent routes led to alphabets of the Arab world and of\nnorthern Africa; to Hebrew and Phoenician; across central Asia, to Brahmi and\nrelated Indian script; and to Greece. The new civilization arising there\nbrought the alphabet to a high degree of perfection. Among others, the Latin\nand Cyrillic alphabets followed along.\n\nGreece had not needed the alphabet to create literature—a fact that scholars\nrealized only grudgingly, beginning in the 1930s. That was when Milman Parry,\na structural linguist who studied the living tradition of oral epic poetry in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, proposed that the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ not only\ncould have been but must have been composed and sung without benefit of\nwriting. The meter, the formulaic redundancy, in effect the very poetry of the\ngreat works served first and foremost to aid memory. Its incantatory power\nmade of the verse a time capsule, able to transmit a virtual encyclopedia of\nculture across generations. His argument was first controversial and then\noverwhelmingly persuasive—but only because the poems _were_ written down,\nsometime in the sixth or seventh century BCE. This act—the transcribing of the\nHomeric epics—echoes through the ages. “It was something like a thunder-clap\nin human history, which the bias of familiarity has converted into the rustle\nof papers on a desk,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1159338) said Eric\nHavelock, a British classical scholar who followed Parry. “It constituted an\nintrusion into culture, with results that proved irreversible. It laid the\nbasis for the destruction of the oral way of life and the oral modes of\nthought.”\n\nThe transcription of Homer converted this great poetry into a new medium and\nmade of it something unplanned: from a momentary string of words created every\ntime anew by the rhapsode and fading again even as it echoed in the listener’s\near, to a fixed but portable line on a papyrus sheet. Whether this alien, dry\nmode would suit the creation of poetry and song remained to be seen. In the\nmeantime the written word helped more mundane forms of discourse: petitions to\nthe gods, statements of law, and economic agreements. Writing also gave rise\nto discourse about discourse. Written texts became objects of a new sort of\ninterest.\n\nBut how was one to speak about them? The words to describe the elements of\nthis discourse did not exist in the lexicon of Homer. The language of an oral\nculture had to be wrenched into new forms; thus a new vocabulary emerged.\nPoems were seen to have _topics_ —the word previously meaning “place.” They\npossessed _structure_ , by analogy with buildings. They were made of _plot_\nand _diction_. Aristotle could now see the works of the bards as\n“representations of life,” born of the natural impulse toward imitation that\nbegins in childhood. But he had also to account for other writing with other\npurposes—the Socratic dialogues, for example, and medical or scientific\ntreatises—and this general type of work, including, presumably, his own,\n“happens, up to the present day, to have no\nname.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1159701) Under construction was a whole\nrealm of abstraction, forcibly divorced from the concrete. Havelock described\nit as cultural warfare, a new consciousness and a new language at war with the\nold consciousness and the old language: “Their conflict produced essential and\npermanent contributions to the vocabulary of all abstract thought. Body and\nspace, matter and motion, permanence and change, quality and quantity,\ncombination and separation, are among the counters of common currency now\navailable.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1159993)\n\nAristotle himself, son of the physician to the king of Macedonia and an avid,\norganized thinker, was attempting to systematize knowledge. The persistence of\nwriting made it possible to impose structure on what was known about the world\nand, then, on what was known about knowing. As soon as one could set words\ndown, examine them, look at them anew the next day, and consider their\nmeaning, one became a philosopher, and the philosopher began with a clean\nslate and a vast project of definition to undertake. Knowledge could begin to\npull itself up by the bootstraps. For Aristotle the most basic notions were\nworth recording and were necessary to record:\n\n> > A _beginning_ is that which itself does not follow necessarily from\n> anything else, but some second thing naturally exists or occurs after it.\n> Conversely, an _end_ is that which does itself naturally follow from\n> something else, either necessarily or in general, but there is nothing else\n> after it. A _middle_ is that which itself comes after something else, and\n> some other thing comes after it.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1160275)\n\nThese are statements not about experience but about the uses of language to\nstructure experience. In the same way, the Greeks created _categories_ (this\nword originally meaning “accusations” or “predictions”) as a means of\nclassifying animal species, insects, and fishes. In turn, they could then\nclassify ideas. This was a radical, alien mode of thought. Plato had warned\nthat it would repel most people:\n\n> > The multitude cannot accept the idea of beauty in itself rather than many\n> beautiful things, nor anything conceived in its essence instead of the many\n> specific things. Thus the multitude cannot be\n> philosophic.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1160583)\n\nFor “the multitude” we may understand “the preliterate.” They “lose themselves\nand wander amid the multiplicities of multifarious\nthings,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1160839) declared Plato, looking back\non the oral culture that still surrounded him. They “have no vivid pattern in\ntheir souls.”\n\nAnd what vivid pattern was that? Havelock focused on the process of\nconverting, mentally, from a “prose of narrative” to a “prose of ideas”;\norganizing experience in terms of categories rather than events; embracing the\ndiscipline of abstraction. He had a word in mind for this process, and the\nword was _thinking_. This was the discovery, not just of the self, but of the\n_thinking_ self—in effect, the true beginning of consciousness.\n\nIn our world of ingrained literacy, thinking and writing seem scarcely related\nactivities. We can imagine the latter depending on the former, but surely not\nthe other way around: everyone thinks, whether or not they write. But Havelock\nwas right. The written word—the persistent word—was a prerequisite for\nconscious thought as we understand it. It was the trigger for a wholesale,\nirreversible change in the human psyche— _psyche_ being the word favored by\nSocrates/Plato as they struggled to understand. Plato, as Havelock puts it,\n\n> > is trying for the first time in history to identify this group of general\n> mental qualities, and seeking for a term which will label them\n> satisfactorily under a single type.… He it was who hailed the portent and\n> correctly identified it. In so doing, he so to speak confirmed and clinched\n> the guesses of a previous generation which had been feeling its way towards\n> the _idea_ that you could “think,” and that thinking was a very special kind\n> of psychic activity, very uncomfortable, but also very exciting, and one\n> which required a very novel use of\n> Greek.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1161037)\n\nTaking the next step on the road of abstraction, Aristotle deployed categories\nand relationships in a regimented order to develop a symbolism of reasoning:\nlogic—from ![](images/00007.jpg), _logos_ , the not-quite-translatable word\nfrom which so much flows, meaning “speech” or “reason” or “discourse” or,\nultimately, just “word.”\n\nLogic might be imagined to exist independent of writing—syllogisms can be\nspoken as well as written—but it did not. Speech is too fleeting to allow for\nanalysis. Logic descended from the written word, in Greece as well as India\nand China, where it developed\nindependently.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1161268) Logic turns the act of\nabstraction into a tool for determining what is true and what is false: truth\ncan be discovered in words alone, apart from concrete experience. Logic takes\nits form in chains: sequences whose members connect one to another.\nConclusions follow from premises. These require a degree of constancy. They\nhave no power unless people can examine and evaluate them. In contrast, an\noral narrative proceeds by accretion, the words passing by in a line of parade\npast the viewing stand, briefly present and then gone, interacting with one\nanother via memory and association. There are no syllogisms in Homer.\nExperience is arranged in terms of events, not categories. Only with writing\ndoes narrative structure come to embody sustained rational argument. Aristotle\ncrossed another level, by seeing the study of such argument—not just the use\nof argument, but its study—as a tool. His logic expresses an ongoing self-\nconsciousness about the words in which they are composed. When Aristotle\nunfurls premises and conclusions— _If it is possible for no man to be a horse,\nit is also admissible for no horse to be a man; and if it is admissible for no\ngarment to be white, it is also admissible for nothing white to be a garment.\nFor if any white thing must be a garment, then some garment will necessarily\nbe white_[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1161614)—he neither requires nor\nimplies any personal experience of horses, garments, or colors. He has\ndeparted that realm. Yet he claims through the manipulation of words to create\nknowledge anyway, and a superior brand of knowledge at that.\n\n“We know that formal logic is the invention of Greek culture after it had\ninteriorized the technology of alphabetic writing,” Walter Ong says—it is true\nof India and China as well—“and so made a permanent part of its noetic\nresources the kind of thinking that alphabetic writing made\npossible.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1161860) For evidence Ong turns to\nfieldwork of the Russian psychologist Aleksandr Romanovich Luria among\nilliterate peoples in remote Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia in the\n1930s.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1162080) Luria found striking differences\nbetween illiterate and even slightly literate subjects, not in what they knew,\nbut in how they thought. Logic implicates symbolism directly: things are\nmembers of classes; they possess qualities, which are abstracted and\ngeneralized. Oral people lacked the categories that become second nature even\nto illiterate individuals in literate cultures: for example, for geometrical\nshapes. Shown drawings of circles and squares, they named them as “plate,\nsieve, bucket, watch, or moon” and “mirror, door, house, apricot drying\nboard.” They could not, or would not, accept logical syllogisms. A typical\nquestion:\n\n> In the Far North, where there is snow, all bears are white.\n>\n> Novaya Zembla is in the Far North and there is always snow there.\n>\n> What color are the bears?\n\nTypical response: “I don’t know. I’ve seen a black bear. I’ve never seen any\nothers.… Each locality has its own animals.”\n\nBy contrast, a man who has just learned to read and write responds, “To go by\nyour words, they should all be white.” To go by your words—in that phrase, a\nlevel is crossed. The information has been detached from any person, detached\nfrom the speaker’s experience. Now it lives in the words, little life-support\nmodules. Spoken words also transport information, but not with the self-\nconsciousness that writing brings. Literate people take for granted their own\nawareness of words, along with the array of word-related machinery:\nclassification, reference, definition. Before literacy, there is nothing\nobvious about such techniques. “Try to explain to me what a tree is,” Luria\nsays, and a peasant replies, “Why should I? Everyone knows what a tree is,\nthey don’t need me telling them.”\n\n“Basically the peasant was right,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1162383) Ong\ncomments. “There is no way to refute the world of primary orality. All you can\ndo is walk away from it into literacy.”\n\nIt is a twisting journey from things to words, from words to categories, from\ncategories to metaphor and logic. Unnatural as it seemed to define _tree_ , it\nwas even trickier to define _word_ , and helpful ancillary words like _define_\nwere not at first available, the need never having existed. “In the infancy of\nlogic, a form of thought has to be invented before the content can be filled\nup,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1162609) said Benjamin Jowett, Aristotle’s\nnineteenth-century translator. Spoken languages needed further evolution.\n\nLanguage and reasoning fit so well that users could not always see the flaws\nand gaps. Still, as soon as any culture invented logic, paradoxes appeared. In\nChina, nearly contemporaneously with Aristotle, the philosopher Gongsun Long\ncaptured some of these in the form of a dialogue, known as “When a White Horse\nIs Not a Horse.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1162888) It was written on\nbamboo strips, tied with string, before the invention of paper. It begins:\n\n> > _Can it be that a white horse is not a horse_?\n>\n\n>> It can.\n\n>\n\n>> _How_?\n\n>\n\n>> “Horse” is that by means of which one names the shape. “White” is that by\nmeans of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the\nshape. Hence, I say that a white horse is not a horse.\n\nOn its face, this is unfathomable. It begins to come into focus as a statement\nabout language and logic. Gongsun Long was a member of the Mingjia, the School\nof Names, and his delving into these paradoxes formed part of what Chinese\nhistorians call the “language crisis,” a running debate over the nature of\nlanguage. Names are not the things they name. Classes are not coextensive with\nsubclasses. Thus innocent-seeming inferences get derailed: “a man dislikes\nwhite horses” does not imply “a man dislikes horses.”\n\n> > You think that horses that are colored are not horses. In the world, it is\n> not the case that there are horses with no color. Can it be that there are\n> no horses in the world?\n\nThe philosopher shines his light on the process of abstracting into classes\nbased on properties: whiteness; horsiness. Are these classes part of reality,\nor do they exist only in language?\n\n> > Horses certainly have color. Hence, there are white horses. If it were the\n> case that horses had no color, there would simply be horses, and then how\n> could one select a white horse? A white horse is a horse and white. A horse\n> and a white horse are different. Hence, I say that a white horse is not a\n> horse.\n\nTwo millennia later, philosophers continue to struggle with these texts. The\npaths of logic into modern thought are roundabout, broken, and complex. Since\nthe paradoxes seem to be in language, or about language, one way to banish\nthem was to purify the medium: eliminate ambiguous words and woolly syntax,\nemploy symbols that were rigorous and pure. To turn, that is, to mathematics.\nBy the beginning of the twentieth century, it seemed that only a system of\npurpose-built symbols could make logic work properly—free of error and\nparadoxes. This dream was to prove illusory; the paradoxes would creep back\nin, but no one could hope to understand until the paths of logic and\nmathematics converged.\n\nMathematics, too, followed from the invention of writing. Greece is often\nthought of as the springhead for the river that becomes modern mathematics,\nwith all its many tributaries down the centuries. But the Greeks themselves\nalluded to another tradition—to them, ancient—which they called Chaldean, and\nwhich we understand to be Babylonian. That tradition vanished into the sands,\nnot to surface until the end of the nineteenth century, when tablets of clay\nwere dug up from the mounds of lost cities.\n\nFirst there were scores, then thousands of tablets, typically the size of a\nhuman hand, etched with a distinctive, edgy, angular writing called cuneiform,\n“wedge shaped.” Mature cuneiform was neither pictographic (the symbols were\nspare and abstract) nor alphabetic (they were far too numerous). By 3000 BCE a\nsystem with about seven hundred symbols flourished in Uruk, the walled city,\nprobably the largest in the world, home of the hero-king Gilgamesh, in the\nalluvial marshes near the Euphrates River. German archeologists excavated Uruk\nin a series of digs all through the twentieth century. The materials for this\nmost ancient of information technologies lay readily at hand. With damp clay\nheld in one hand and a stylus of sharpened reed in the other, a scribe would\nimprint tiny characters in columns and rows.\n\nThe result: cryptic messages from an alien culture. They took generations to\ndecipher. “Writing, like a theater curtain going up on these dazzling\ncivilizations, lets us stare directly but imperfectly at\nthem,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1163493) writes the psychologist Julian\nJaynes. Some Europeans took umbrage at first. “To the Assyrians, the\nChaldeans, and Egyptians,” wrote the seventeenth-century divine Thomas Sprat,\n“we owe the Invention” but also the “Corruption of\nknowledge,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1163808) when they concealed it with\ntheir strange scripts. “It was the custom of their Wise men, to wrap up their\nObservations on Nature, and the Manners of Men, in the dark Shadows of\n_Hieroglyphicks_ ” (as though friendlier ancients would have used an alphabet\nmore familiar to Sprat). The earliest examples of cuneiform baffled\narcheologists and paleolinguists the longest, because the first language to be\nwritten, Sumerian, left no other traces in culture or speech. Sumerian turned\nout to be a linguistic rarity, an isolate, with no known descendants. When\nscholars did learn to read the Uruk tablets, they found them to be, in their\nway, humdrum: civic memoranda, contracts and laws, and receipts and bills for\nbarley, livestock, oil, reed mats, and pottery. Nothing like poetry or\nliterature appeared in cuneiform for hundreds of years to come. The tablets\nwere the quotidiana of nascent commerce and bureaucracy. The tablets not only\nrecorded the commerce and the bureaucracy but, in the first place, made them\npossible.\n\n![](images/00008.jpg)\n\nA CUNEIFORM TABLET\n\nEven then, cuneiform incorporated signs for counting and measurement.\nDifferent characters, used in different ways, could denote numbers and\nweights. A more systematic approach to the writing of numbers did not take\nshape until the time of Hammurabi, 1750 BCE, when Mesopotamia was unified\naround the great city of Babylon. Hammurabi himself was probably the first\nliterate king, writing his own cuneiform rather than depending on scribes, and\nhis empire building manifested the connection between writing and social\ncontrol. “This process of conquest and influence is made possible by letters\nand tablets and stelae in an abundance that had never been known\nbefore,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1164133) Jaynes declares. “Writing was\na new method of civil direction, indeed the model that begins our own memo-\ncommunicating government.”\n\nThe writing of numbers had evolved into an elaborate system. Numerals were\ncomposed of just two basic parts, a vertical wedge for 1\n(![](images/00009.jpg)) and an angle wedge for 10 (![](images/00010.jpg)).\nThese were combined to form the standard characters, so that\n![](images/00011.jpg) represented 3 and ![](images/00012.jpg) represented 16,\nand so on. But the Babylonian system was not decimal, base 10; it was\nsexagesimal, base 60. Each of the numerals from 1 to 60 had its own character.\nTo form large numbers, the Babylonians used numerals in places:\n![](images/00013.jpg) was 70 (one 60 plus ten 1s); ![](images/00014.jpg) was\n616 (ten 60s plus sixteen 1s), and so\non.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1164413) None of this was clear when the\ntablets first began to surface. A basic theme with variations, encountered\nmany times, proved to be multiplication tables. In a sexagesimal system these\nhad to cover the numbers from 1 to 19 as well as 20, 30, 40, and 50. Even more\ndifficult to unravel were tables of reciprocals, making possible division and\nfractional numbers: in the 60-based system, reciprocals were 2:30, 3:20, 4:15,\n5:12 … and then, using extra places, 8:7,30, 9:6,40, and so on.*\n\n![](images/00015.jpg)\n\nA MATHEMATICAL TABLE ON A CUNEIFORM TABLET ANALYZED BY ASGER AABOE\n\nThese symbols were hardly words—or they were words of a peculiar, slender,\nrigid sort. They seemed to arrange themselves into visible patterns in the\nclay, repetitious, almost artistic, not like any prose or poetry archeologists\nhad encountered. They were like maps of a mysterious city. This was the key to\ndeciphering them, finally: the ordered chaos that seems to guarantee the\npresence of meaning. It seemed like a task for mathematicians, anyway, and\nfinally it was. They recognized geometric progressions, tables of powers, and\neven instructions for computing square roots and cube roots. Familiar as they\nwere with the rise of mathematics a millennium later in ancient Greece, these\nscholars were astounded at the breadth and depth of mathematical knowledge\nthat existed before in Mesopotamia. “It was assumed that the Babylonians had\nhad some sort of number mysticism or numerology,” wrote Asger Aaboe in 1963,\n“but we now know how far short of the truth this assumption\nwas.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1164744) The Babylonians computed linear\nequations, quadratic equations, and Pythagorean numbers long before\nPythagoras. In contrast to the Greek mathematics that followed, Babylonian\nmathematics did not emphasize geometry, except for practical problems; the\nBabylonians calculated areas and perimeters but did not prove theorems. Yet\nthey could (in effect) reduce elaborate second-degree polynomials. Their\nmathematics seemed to value computational power above all.\n\nThat could not be appreciated until computational power began to mean\nsomething. By the time modern mathematicians turned their attention to\nBabylon, many important tablets had already been destroyed or scattered.\nFragments retrieved from Uruk before 1914, for example, were dispersed to\nBerlin, Paris, and Chicago and only fifty years later were discovered to hold\nthe beginning methods of astronomy. To demonstrate this, Otto Neugebauer, the\nleading twentieth-century historian of ancient mathematics, had to reassemble\ntablets whose fragments had made their way to opposite sides of the Atlantic\nOcean. In 1949, when the number of cuneiform tablets housed in museums reached\n(at his rough guess) a half million, Neugebauer lamented, “Our task can\ntherefore properly be compared with restoring the history of mathematics from\na few torn pages which have accidentally survived the destruction of a great\nlibrary.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1165028)\n\nIn 1972, Donald Knuth, an early computer scientist at Stanford, looked at the\nremains of an Old Babylonian tablet the size of a paperback book, half lying\nin the British Museum in London, one-fourth in the Staatliche Museen in\nBerlin, and the rest missing, and saw what he could only describe,\nanachronistically, as an algorithm:\n\n> A cistern.\n>\n> The height is 3,20, and a volume of 27,46,40 has been excavated.\n>\n> The length exceeds the width by 50.\n>\n> You should take the reciprocal of the height, 3,20, obtaining 18.\n>\n> Multiply this by the volume, 27,46,40, obtaining 8,20.\n>\n> Take half of 50 and square it, obtaining 10,25.\n>\n> Add 8,20, and you get 8,30,25.\n>\n> The square root is 2,55.\n>\n> Make two copies of this, adding to the one and subtracting from the other.\n>\n> You find that 3,20 is the length and 2,30 is the width.\n>\n> This is the procedure.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1165354)\n\n“This is the procedure” was a standard closing, like a benediction, and for\nKnuth redolent with meaning. In the Louvre he found a “procedure” that\nreminded him of a stack program on a Burroughs B5500. “We can commend the\nBabylonians for developing a nice way to explain an algorithm by example as\nthe algorithm itself was being defined,” said Knuth. By then he himself was\nengrossed in the project of defining and explaining the algorithm; he was\namazed by what he found on the ancient tablets. The scribes wrote instructions\nfor placing numbers in certain locations—for making “copies” of a number, and\nfor keeping a number “in your head.” This idea, of abstract quantities\noccupying abstract places, would not come back to life till much later.\n\nWhere is a symbol? What is a symbol? Even to ask such questions required a\nself-consciousness that did not come naturally. Once asked, the questions\ncontinued to loom. _Look at these signs_ , philosophers implored. _What are\nthey_?\n\n“Fundamentally letters are shapes indicating\nvoices,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1165597) explained John of Salisbury in\nmedieval England. “Hence they represent things which they bring to mind\nthrough the windows of the eyes.” John served as secretary and scribe to the\nArchbishop of Canterbury in the twelfth century. He served the cause of\nAristotle as an advocate and salesman. His Metalogicon not only set forth the\nprinciples of Aristotelian logic but urged his contemporaries to convert, as\nthough to a new religion. (He did not mince words: “Let him who is not come to\nlogic be plagued with continuous and everlasting filth.”) Putting pen to\nparchment in this time of barest literacy, he tried to examine the act of\nwriting and the effect of words: “Frequently they speak voicelessly the\nutterances of the absent.” The idea of writing was still entangled with the\nidea of speaking. The mixing of the visual and the auditory continued to\ncreate puzzles, and so also did the mixing of past and future: utterances of\nthe absent. Writing leapt across these levels.\n\nEvery user of this technology was a novice. Those composing formal legal\ndocuments, such as charters and deeds, often felt the need to express their\nsensation of speaking to an invisible audience: “Oh! all ye who shall have\nheard this and have seen!”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1165977) (They found\nit awkward to keep tenses straight, like voicemail novices leaving their first\nmessages circa 1980.) Many charters ended with the word “Goodbye.” Before\nwriting could feel natural in itself—could become second nature—these echoes\nof voices had to fade away. Writing in and of itself had to reshape human\nconsciousness.\n\nAmong the many abilities gained by the written culture, not the least was the\npower of looking inward upon itself. Writers loved to discuss writing, far\nmore than bards ever bothered to discuss speech. They could _see_ the medium\nand its messages, hold them up to the mind’s eye for study and analysis. And\nthey could criticize it—for from the very start, the new abilities were\naccompanied by a nagging sense of loss. It was a form of nostalgia. Plato felt\nit:\n\n> > I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, [says Socrates] that writing is\n> unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the\n> attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn\n> silence.… You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to\n> know anything and put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives\n> one unvarying answer.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1166159)\n\nUnfortunately the written word stands still. It is stable and immobile.\nPlato’s qualms were mostly set aside in the succeeding millennia, as the\nculture of literacy developed its many gifts: history and the law; the\nsciences and philosophy; the reflective explication of art and literature\nitself. None of that could have emerged from pure orality. Great poetry could\nand did, but it was expensive and rare. To make the epics of Homer, to let\nthem be heard, to sustain them across the years and the miles required a\nconsiderable share of the available cultural energy.\n\nThen the vanished world of primary orality was not much missed. Not until the\ntwentieth century, amid a burgeoning of new media for communication, did the\nqualms and the nostalgia resurface. Marshall McLuhan, who became the most\nfamous spokesman for the bygone oral culture, did so in the service of an\nargument for modernity. He hailed the new “electric age” not for its newness\nbut for its return to the roots of human creativity. He saw it as a revival of\nthe old orality. “We are in our century ‘winding the tape backward,’\n”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1166374) he declared, finding his metaphorical\ntape in one of the newest information technologies. He constructed a series of\npolemical contrasts: the printed word vs. the spoken word; cold/hot;\nstatic/fluid; neutral/magical; impoverished/rich; regimented/creative;\nmechanical/organic; separatist/integrative. “The alphabet is a technology of\nvisual fragmentation and specialism,” he wrote. It leads to “a desert of\nclassified data.” One way of framing McLuhan’s critique of print would be to\nsay that print offers only a narrow channel of communication. The channel is\nlinear and even fragmented. By contrast, speech—in the primal case, face-to-\nface human intercourse, alive with gesture and touch—engages all the senses,\nnot just hearing. If the ideal of communication is a meeting of souls, then\nwriting is a sad shadow of the ideal.\n\nThe same criticism was made of other constrained channels, created by later\ntechnologies—the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and e-mail. Jonathan Miller\nrephrases McLuhan’s argument in quasi-technical terms of information: “The\nlarger the number of senses involved, the better the chance of transmitting a\nreliable copy of the sender’s mental\nstate.”*[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1166686) In the stream of words past\nthe ear or eye, we sense not just the items one by one but their rhythms and\ntones, which is to say their music. We, the listener or the reader, do not\nhear, or read, one word at a time; we get messages in groupings small and\nlarge. Human memory being what it is, larger patterns can be grasped in\nwriting than in sound. The eye can glance back. McLuhan considered this\ndamaging, or at least diminishing. “Acoustic space is organic and integral,”\nhe said, “perceived through the simultaneous interplay of all the senses;\nwhereas ‘rational’ or pictorial space is uniform, sequential and continuous\nand creates a closed world with none of the rich resonance of the tribal\necholand.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1166918) For McLuhan, the tribal\necholand is Eden.\n\n> > By their dependence on the spoken word for information, people were drawn\n> together into a tribal mesh … the spoken word is more emotionally laden than\n> the written.… Audile-tactile tribal man partook of the collective\n> unconscious, lived in a magical integral world patterned by myth and ritual,\n> its values divine.*\n\nUp to a point, maybe. Yet three centuries earlier, Thomas Hobbes, looking from\na vantage where literacy was new, had taken a less rosy view. He could see the\npreliterate culture more clearly: “Men lived upon gross experience,” he wrote.\n“There was no method; that is to say, no sowing nor planting of knowledge by\nitself, apart from the weeds and common plants of error and\nconjecture.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1167164) A sorry place, neither\nmagical nor divine.\n\nWas McLuhan right, or was Hobbes? If we are ambivalent, the ambivalence began\nwith Plato. He witnessed writing’s rising dominion; he asserted its force and\nfeared its lifelessness. The writer-philosopher embodied a paradox. The same\nparadox was destined to reappear in different guises, each technology of\ninformation bringing its own powers and its own fears. It turns out that the\n“forgetfulness” Plato feared does not arise. It does not arise because Plato\nhimself, with his mentor Socrates and his disciple Aristotle, designed a\nvocabulary of ideas, organized them into categories, set down rules of logic,\nand so fulfilled the promise of the technology of writing. All this made\nknowledge more durable stuff than before.\n\nAnd the atom of knowledge was the word. Or was it? For some time to come, the\nword continued to elude its pursuers, whether it was a fleeting burst of sound\nor a fixed cluster of marks. “Most literate persons, when you say, ‘Think of a\nword,’ at least in some vague fashion think of something before their eyes,”\nOng says, “where a real word can never be at\nall.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1167515) Where do we look for the words,\nthen? In the dictionary, of course. Ong also said: “It is demoralizing to\nremind oneself that there is no dictionary in the mind, that lexicographical\napparatus is a very late accretion to\nlanguage.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1167802)\n\n* * *\n\n* It is customary to transcribe a two-place sexagesimal cuneiform number with a comma—such as “7,30.” But the scribes did not use such punctuation, and in fact their notation left the place values undefined; that is, their numbers were what we would call “floating point.” A two-place number like 7,30 could be 450 (seven 60s + thirty 1s) or 7½ (seven 1s + thirty 1/60s).\n\n* Not that Miller agrees. On the contrary: “It is hard to overestimate the subtle reflexive effects of literacy upon the creative imagination, providing as it does a cumulative deposit of ideas, images, and idioms upon whose rich and appreciating funds every artist enjoys an unlimited right of withdrawal.”\n\n* The interviewer asked plaintively, “But aren’t there corresponding gains in insight, understanding and cultural diversity to compensate detribalized man?” McLuhan responded, “Your question reflects all the institutionalized biases of literate man.”\n\n\n# 3 | TWO WORDBOOKS\n\n\n##\n\n> (The Uncertainty in Our Writing, the Inconstancy in Our Letters)\n\n> _In such busie, and active times, there arise more new thoughts of men,\n> which must be signifi’d, and varied by new expressions._\n\n> —Thomas Sprat (1667)[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1168133)\n\nA VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER AND PRIEST made a book in 1604 with a rambling title\nthat began “A Table Alphabeticall, conteyning and teaching the true writing,\nand understanding of hard usuall English wordes,” and went on with more hints\nto its purpose, which was unusual and needed\nexplanation:[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1168443)\n\n> > With the interpretation thereof by plaine English words, gathered for the\n> benefit & helpe of Ladies, Gentlewomen, or any other unskilfull persons.\n>\n\n>> Whereby they may the more easily and better understand many hard English\nwordes, which they shall heare or read in Scriptures, Sermons, or elsewhere,\nand also be made able to use the same aptly themselves.\n\nThe title page omitted the name of the author, Robert Cawdrey, but included a\nmotto from Latin—“As good not read, as not to understand”—and situated the\npublisher with as much formality and exactness as could be expected in a time\nwhen the _address_ , as a specification of place, did not yet exist:\n\n> > At London, Printed by I. R. for Edmund Weaver, & are to be sold at his\n> shop at the great North doore of Paules Church.\n\n![](images/00016.jpg)\n\nCAWDREY’S TITLE PAGE\n\nEven in London’s densely packed streets, shops and homes were seldom to be\nfound by number. The alphabet, however, had a definite order—the first and\nsecond letters providing its very name—and that order had been maintained\nsince the early Phoenician times, through all the borrowing and evolution that\nfollowed.\n\nCawdrey lived in a time of information poverty. He would not have thought so,\neven had he possessed the concept. On the contrary, he would have considered\nhimself to be in the midst of an information explosion, which he himself was\ntrying to abet and organize. But four centuries later, his own life is\nshrouded in the obscurity of missing knowledge. His _Table Alphabeticall_\nappears as a milestone in the history of information, yet of its entire first\nedition, just one worn copy survived into the future. When and where he was\nborn remain unknown—probably in the late 1530s; probably in the Midlands.\nParish registers notwithstanding, people’s lives were almost wholly\nundocumented. No one has even a definitive spelling for Cawdrey’s name\n(Cowdrey, Cawdry). But then, no one agreed on the spelling of most names: they\nwere spoken, seldom written.\n\nIn fact, few had any concept of “spelling”—the idea that each word, when\nwritten, should take a particular predetermined form of letters. The word\n_cony_ (rabbit) appeared variously as _conny, conye, conie, connie, coni,\ncuny, cunny_ , and _cunnie_ in a single 1591\npamphlet.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1169067) Others spelled it\ndifferently. And for that matter Cawdrey himself, on the title page of his\nbook for “teaching the true writing,” wrote _wordes_ in one sentence and\n_words_ in the next. Language did not function as a storehouse of words, from\nwhich users could summon the correct items, preformed. On the contrary, words\nwere fugitive, on the fly, expected to vanish again thereafter. When spoken,\nthey were not available to be compared with, or measured against, other\ninstantiations of themselves. Every time people dipped quill in ink to form a\nword on paper they made a fresh choice of whatever letters seemed to suit the\ntask. But this was changing. The availability—the solidity—of the printed book\ninspired a sense that the written word _should be_ a certain way, that one\nform was right and others wrong. First this sense was unconscious; then it\nbegan to rise toward general awareness. Printers themselves made it their\nbusiness.\n\n_To spell_ (from an old Germanic word) first meant to speak or to utter. Then\nit meant to read, slowly, letter by letter. Then, by extension, just around\nCawdrey’s time, it meant to write words letter by letter. The last was a\nsomewhat poetic usage. “Spell Eva back and Ave shall you find,” wrote the\nJesuit poet Robert Southwell (shortly before being hanged and quartered in\n1595). When certain educators did begin to consider the idea of spelling, they\nwould say “right writing”—or, to borrow from Greek, “ _orthography_.” Few\nbothered, but one who did was a school headmaster in London, Richard\nMulcaster. He assembled a primer, titled “The first part [a second part was\nnot to be] of the Elementarie which entreateth chefelie of the right writing\nof our English tung.” He published it in 1582 (“at London by Thomas\nVautroullier dwelling in the blak-friers by Lud-gate”), including his own list\nof about eight thousand words and a plea for the idea of a dictionary:\n\n> > It were a thing verie praiseworthie in my opinion, and no lesse profitable\n> than praise worthie, if some one well learned and as laborious a man, wold\n> gather all the words which we use in our English tung … into one\n> dictionarie, and besides the right writing, which is incident to the\n> Alphabete, wold open unto us therein, both their naturall force, and their\n> proper use.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1169441)\n\nHe recognized another motivating factor: the quickening pace of commerce and\ntransportation made other languages a palpable presence, forcing an awareness\nof the English language as just one among many. “Forenners and strangers do\nwonder at us,” Mulcaster wrote, “both for the uncertaintie in our writing, and\nthe inconstancie in our letters.” Language was no longer invisible like the\nair.\n\nBarely 5 million people on earth spoke English (a rough estimate; no one tried\nto count the population of England, Scotland, or Ireland until 1801). Barely a\nmillion of those could write. Of all the world’s languages English was already\nthe most checkered, the most mottled, the most polygenetic. Its history showed\ncontinual corruption and enrichment from without. Its oldest core words, the\nwords that felt most basic, came from the language spoken by the Angles,\nSaxons, and Jutes, Germanic tribes that crossed the North Sea into England in\nthe fifth century, pushing aside the Celtic inhabitants. Not much of Celtic\npenetrated the Anglo-Saxon speech, but Viking invaders brought more words from\nNorse and Danish: _egg, sky, anger, give, get_. Latin came by way of Christian\nmissionaries; they wrote in the alphabet of the Romans, which replaced the\nrunic scripts that spread in central and northern Europe early in the first\nmillennium. Then came the influence of French.\n\n_Influence_ , to Robert Cawdrey, meant “a flowing in.” The Norman Conquest was\nmore like a deluge, linguistically. English peasants of the lower classes\ncontinued to breed _cows_ , _pigs_ , and _oxen_ (Germanic words), but in the\nsecond millennium the upper classes dined on _beef_ , _pork_ , and _mutton_\n(French). By medieval times French and Latin roots accounted for more than\nhalf of the common vocabulary. More alien words came when intellectuals began\nconsciously to borrow from Latin and Greek to express concepts the language\nhad not before needed. Cawdrey found this habit irritating. “Some men seek so\nfar for outlandish English, that they forget altogether their mothers\nlanguage, so that if some of their mothers were alive, they were not able to\ntell, or understand what they say,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1169786) he\ncomplained. “One might well charge them, for counterfeyting the Kings\nEnglish.”\n\nFour hundred years after Cawdrey published his book of words, John Simpson\nretraced Cawdrey’s path. Simpson was in certain respects his natural heir: the\neditor of a grander book of words, the _Oxford English Dictionary_. Simpson, a\npale, soft-spoken man, saw Cawdrey as obstinate, uncompromising, and even\npugnacious. The schoolteacher was ordained a deacon and then a priest of the\nChurch of England in a restless time, when Puritanism was on the rise.\nNonconformity led him into trouble. He seems to have been guilty of “not\nConforming himself” to some of the sacraments, such as “the Cross in Baptism,\nand the Ring in Marriage.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1170035) As a village\npriest he did not care to bow down to bishops and archbishops. He preached a\nform of equality unwelcome to church authorities. “There was preferred\nsecretly an Information against him for speaking diverse Words in the Pulpit,\ntending to the depraving of the Book of Common Prayer.… And so being judged a\ndangerous Person, if he should continue preaching, but infecting the People\nwith Principles different from the Religion established.” Cawdrey was degraded\nfrom the priesthood and deprived of his benefice. He continued to fight the\ncase for years, to no avail.\n\nAll that time, he collected words (“**collect** , gather”). He published two\ninstructional treatises, one on catechism (“**catechiser** , that teacheth the\nprinciples of Christian religion”) and one on _A godlie forme of householde\ngovernment for the ordering of private families_ , and in 1604 he produced a\ndifferent sort of book: nothing more than a list of words, with brief\ndefinitions.\n\nWhy? Simpson says, “We have already seen that he was committed to simplicity\nin language, and that he was strong-minded to the point of obstinacy.” He was\nstill preaching—now, to preachers. “Such as by their place and calling (but\nespecially Preachers) as have occasion to speak publiquely before the ignorant\npeople,” Cawdrey declared in his introductory note, “are to bee admonished.”\nHe admonishes them. “Never affect any strange ynckhorne termes.” (An _inkhorn_\nwas an inkpot; by _inkhorn term_ he meant a bookish word.) “Labour to speake\nso as is commonly received, and so as the most ignorant may well understand\nthem.” And above all do not affect to speak like a foreigner:\n\n> > Some far journied gentlemen, at their returne home, like as they love to\n> go in forraine apparrell, so they will pouder their talke with over-sea\n> language. He that commeth lately out of France, will talk French English,\n> and never blush at the matter.\n\nCawdrey had no idea of listing _all_ the words—whatever that would mean. By\n1604 William Shakespeare had written most of his plays, employing a vocabulary\nof nearly 30,000, but these words were not available to Cawdrey or anyone\nelse. Cawdrey did not bother with the most common words, nor the most inkhorn\nand Frenchified words; he listed only the “hard usual” words, words difficult\nenough to need some explanation but still “proper unto the tongue wherein we\nspeake” and “plaine for all men to perceive.” He compiled 2,500. He knew that\nmany were derived from Greek, French, and Latin (“**derive** , fetch from”),\nand he marked these accordingly. The book Cawdrey made was the first English\ndictionary. The word _dictionary_ was not in it.\n\nAlthough Cawdrey cited no authorities, he had relied on some. He copied the\nremarks about inkhorn terms and the far-journeyed gentlemen in their foreign\napparel from Thomas Wilson’s successful book _The Arte of\nRhetorique_.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1170409) For the words themselves\nhe found several sources (“**source** , wave, or issuing foorth of water”). He\nfound about half his words in a primer for teaching reading, called _The\nEnglish Schoole-maister_ , by Edmund Coote, first published in 1596 and widely\nreprinted thereafter. Coote claimed that a schoolmaster could teach a hundred\nstudents more quickly with his text than forty without it. He found it\nworthwhile to explain the benefits of teaching people to read: “So more\nknowledge will be brought into this Land, and moe bookes bought, than\notherwise would have been.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1170744) Coote\nincluded a long glossary, which Cawdrey plundered.\n\nThat Cawdrey should arrange his words in alphabetical order, to make his\n_Table Alphabeticall_ , was not self-evident. He knew he could not count on\neven his educated readers to be versed in alphabetical order, so he tried to\nproduce a small how-to manual. He struggled with this: whether to describe the\nordering in logical, schematic terms or in terms of a step-by-step procedure,\nan algorithm. “Gentle reader,” he wrote—again adapting freely from Coote—\n\n> > thou must learne the Alphabet, to wit, the order of the Letters as they\n> stand, perfectly without booke, and where every Letter standeth: as _b_\n> neere the beginning, _n_ about the middest, and _t_ toward the end. Nowe if\n> the word, which thou art desirous to finde, begin with _a_ then looke in the\n> beginning of this Table, but if with _v_ looke towards the end. Againe, if\n> thy word beginne with _ca_ looke in the beginning of the letter _c_ but if\n> with _cu_ then looke toward the end of that letter. And so of all the rest.\n> &c.\n\nIt was not easy to explain. Friar Johannes Balbus of Genoa tried in his 1286\n_Catholicon_. Balbus thought he was inventing alphabetical order for the first\ntime, and his instructions were painstaking: “For example I intend to discuss\n_amo_ and _bibo_. I will discuss _amo_ before _bibo_ because _a_ is the first\nletter of _amo_ and _b_ is the first letter of _bibo_ and _a_ is before _b_ in\nthe alphabet. Similarly …”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1171042) He rehearsed\na long list of examples and concluded: “I beg of you, therefore, good reader,\ndo not scorn this great labor of mine and this order as something worthless.”\n\nIn the ancient world, alphabetical lists scarcely appeared until around 250\nBCE, in papyrus texts from Alexandria. The great library there seems to have\nused at least some alphabetization in organizing its books. The need for such\nan artificial ordering scheme arises only with large collections of data, not\notherwise ordered. And the possibility of alphabetical order arises only in\nlanguages possessing an alphabet: a discrete small symbol set with its own\nconventional sequence (“**abecedarie** , the order of the Letters, or hee that\nuseth them”). Even then the system is unnatural. It forces the user to detach\ninformation from meaning; to treat words strictly as character strings; to\nfocus abstractly on the configuration of the word. Furthermore, alphabetical\nordering comprises a pair of procedures, one the inverse of the other:\norganizing a list and looking up items; sorting and searching. In either\ndirection the procedure is recursive (“**recourse** , a running backe\nagaine”). The basic operation is a binary decision: greater than or less than.\nThis operation is performed first on one letter; then, nested as a subroutine,\non the next letter; and (as Cawdrey put it, struggling with the awkwardness)\n“so of all the rest. &c.” This makes for astounding efficiency. The system\nscales easily to any size, the macrostructure being identical to the\nmicrostructure. A person who understands alphabetical order homes in on any\none item in a list of a thousand or a million, unerringly, with perfect\nconfidence. And without knowing anything about the meaning.\n\nNot until 1613 was the first alphabetical catalogue made—not printed, but\nwritten in two small handbooks—for the Bodleian Library at\nOxford.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1171401) The first catalogue of a\nuniversity library, made at Leiden, Holland, two decades earlier, was arranged\nby subject matter, as a shelf list (about 450 books), with no alphabetical\nindex. Of one thing Cawdrey could be sure: his typical reader, a literate,\nbook-buying Englishman at the turn of the seventeenth century, could live a\nlifetime without ever encountering a set of data ordered alphabetically.\n\nMore sensible ways of ordering words came first and lingered for a long time.\nIn China the closest thing to a dictionary for many centuries was the _Erya_ ,\nauthor unknown, date unknown but probably around the third century BCE. It\narranged its two thousand entries by meaning, in topical categories: kinship,\nbuilding, tools and weapons, the heavens, the earth, plants and animals.\nEgyptian had word lists organized on philosophical or educational principles;\nso did Arabic. These lists were arranging not the words themselves, mainly,\nbut rather the world: the things for which the words stood. In Germany, a\ncentury after Cawdrey, the philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz made this distinction explicit:\n\n> > Let me mention that the words or names of all things and actions can be\n> brought into a list in two different ways, according to the alphabet and\n> according to nature.… The former go from the word to the thing, the latter\n> from the thing to the word.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1171700)\n\nTopical lists were thought provoking, imperfect, and creative. Alphabetical\nlists were mechanical, effective, and automatic. Considered alphabetically,\nwords are no more than tokens, each placed in a slot. In effect they may as\nwell be numbers.\n\nMeaning comes into the dictionary in its definitions, of course. Cawdrey’s\ncrucial models were dictionaries for translation, especially a 1587 Latin-\nEnglish _Dictionarium_ by Thomas Thomas. A bilingual dictionary had a clearer\npurpose than a dictionary of one language alone: mapping Latin onto English\nmade a kind of sense that translating English to English did not. Yet\ndefinitions were the point, Cawdrey’s stated purpose being after all to help\npeople understand and use hard words. He approached the task of definition\nwith a trepidation that remains palpable. Even as he defined his words,\nCawdrey still did not quite believe in their solidity. Meanings were even more\nfluid than spellings. _Define_ , to Cawdrey, was for things, not for words:\n“**define** , to shew clearely what a thing is.” It was reality, in all its\nrichness, that needed defining. _Interpret_ meant “open, make plaine, to shewe\nthe sence and meaning of a thing.” For him the relationship between the thing\nand the word was like the relationship between an object and its shadow.\n\nThe relevant concepts had not reached maturity:\n\n> **figurate** , to shadowe, or represent, or to counterfaite\n>\n> **type** , figure, example, shadowe of any thing\n>\n> **represent** , expresse, beare shew of a thing\n\nAn earlier contemporary of Cawdrey’s, Ralph Lever, made up his own word:\n“**saywhat** , corruptly called a definition: but it is a saying which telleth\nwhat a thing is, it may more aptly be called a\nsaywhat.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1172098) This did not catch on. It\ntook almost another century—and the examples of Cawdrey and his successors—for\nthe modern sense to come into focus: “Definition,” John Locke finally writes\nin 1690, “being nothing but making another understand by Words, what Idea the\nTerm defin’d stands for.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1172403) And Locke\nstill takes an operational view. Definition is communication: making another\nunderstand; sending a message.\n\nCawdrey borrows definitions from his sources, combines them, and adapts them.\nIn many case he simply maps one word onto another:\n\n> **orifice** , mouth\n>\n> **baud** , whore\n>\n> **helmet** , head peece\n\nFor a small class of words he uses a special designation, the letter _k:_\n“standeth for a kind of.” He does not consider it his job to say _what_ kind.\nThus:\n\n> **crocodile** , _k_ beast\n>\n> **alablaster** , _k_ stone\n>\n> **citron** , _k_ fruit\n\nBut linking pairs of words, either as synonyms or as members of a class, can\ncarry a lexicographer only so far. The relationships among the words of a\nlanguage are far too complex for so linear an approach (“**chaos** , a\nconfused heap of mingle-mangle”). Sometimes Cawdrey tries to cope by adding\none or more extra synonyms, definition by triangulation:\n\n> **specke** , spot, or marke\n>\n> **cynicall** , doggish, froward\n>\n> **vapor** , moisture, ayre, hote breath, or reaking\n\nFor other words, representing concepts and abstractions, further removed from\nthe concrete realm of the senses, Cawdrey needs to find another style\naltogether. He makes it up as he goes along. He must speak to his reader, in\nprose but not quite in sentences, and we can hear him struggle, both to\nunderstand certain words and to express his understanding.\n\n> **gargarise** , to wash the mouth, and throate within, by stirring some\n> liquor up and downe in the mouth\n>\n> **hipocrite** , such a one as in his outward apparrell, countenaunce, &\n> behaviour, pretendeth to be another man, then he is indeede, or a deceiver\n>\n> **buggerie** , coniunction with one of the same kinde, or of men with beasts\n>\n> **theologie** , divinitie, the science of living blessedly for ever\n\nAmong the most troublesome were technical terms from new sciences:\n\n> **cypher** , a circle in numbering, of no value of it selfe, but serveth to\n> make up the number, and to make other figures of more value\n>\n> **horizon** , a circle, deviding the halfe of the firmament, from the other\n> halfe which we see not\n>\n> **zodiack** , a circle in the heaven, wherein be placed the 12 signes, and\n> in which the Sunne is mooved\n\nNot just the words but the knowledge was in flux. The language was examining\nitself. Even when Cawdrey is copying from Coote or Thomas, he is fundamentally\nalone, with no authority to consult.\n\nOne of Cawdrey’s hard usual words was _science_ (“knowledge, or skill”).\nScience did not yet exist as an institution responsible for learning about the\nmaterial universe and its laws. Natural philosophers were beginning to have a\nspecial interest in the nature of words and their meaning. They needed better\nthan they had. When Galileo pointed his first telescope skyward and discovered\nsunspots in 1611, he immediately anticipated controversy—traditionally the sun\nwas an epitome of purity—and he sensed that science could not proceed without\nfirst solving a problem of language:\n\n> > So long as men were in fact obliged to call the sun “most pure and most\n> lucid,” no shadows or impurities whatever had been perceived in it; but now\n> that it shows itself to us as partly impure and spotty; why should we not\n> call it “spotted and not pure”? For names and attributes must be\n> accommodated to the essence of things, and not the essence to the names,\n> since things come first and names\n> afterwards.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1172704)\n\nWhen Isaac Newton embarked on his great program, he encountered a fundamental\nlack of definition where it was most needed. He began with a semantic sleight\nof hand: “I do not define time, space, place, and motion, as being well known\nto all,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1173004) he wrote deceptively. Defining\nthese words was his very purpose. There were no agreed standards for weights\nand measures. _Weight_ and _measure_ were themselves vague terms. Latin seemed\nmore reliable than English, precisely because it was less worn by everyday\nuse, but the Romans had not possessed the necessary words either. Newton’s raw\nnotes reveal a struggle hidden in the finished product. He tried expressions\nlike _quantitas materiae_. Too hard for Cawdrey: “**materiall** , of some\nmatter, or importance.” Newton suggested (to himself) “that which arises from\nits density and bulk conjointly.” He considered more words: “This quantity I\ndesignate under the name of body or mass.” Without the right words he could\nnot proceed. _Velocity, force, gravity_ —none of these were yet suitable. They\ncould not be defined in terms of one another; there was nothing in visible\nnature at which anyone could point a finger; and there was no book in which to\nlook them up.\n\nAs for Robert Cawdrey, his mark on history ends with the publication of his\n_Table Alphabeticall_ in 1604. No one knows when he died. No one knows how\nmany copies the printer made. There are no records (“**records** , writings\nlayde up for remembrance”). A single copy made its way to the Bodleian Library\nin Oxford, which has preserved it. All the others disappeared. A second\nedition appeared in 1609, slightly expanded (“much inlarged,” the title page\nclaims falsely) by Cawdrey’s son, Thomas, and a third and fourth appeared in\n1613 and 1617, and there the life of this book ended.\n\nIt was overshadowed by a new dictionary, twice as comprehensive, _An English\nExpositour: Teaching the Interpretation of the hardest Words used in our\nLanguage, with sundry Explications, Descriptions, and Discourses_. Its\ncompiler, John Bullokar, otherwise left as faint a mark on the historical\nrecord as Cawdrey did.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1173298) He was doctor of\nphysic; he lived for some time in Chichester; his dates of birth and death are\nuncertain; he is said to have visited London in 1611 and there to have seen a\ndead crocodile; and little else is known. His _Expositour_ appeared in 1616\nand went through several editions in the succeeding decades. Then in 1656 a\nLondon barrister, Thomas Blount, published his _Glossographia: or a\nDictionary, Interpreting all such Hard Words of Whatsoever Language,now used\nin our refined English Tongue_. Blount’s dictionary listed more than eleven\nthousand words, many of which, he recognized, were new, reaching London in the\nhurly-burly of trade and commerce—\n\n> > **coffa** or **cauphe** , a kind of drink among the Turks and Persians,\n> (and of late introduced among us) which is black, thick and bitter,\n> destrained from Berries of that nature, and name, thought good and very\n> wholesom: they say it expels melancholy.\n\n—or home-grown, such as “**tom-boy** , a girle or wench that leaps up and down\nlike a boy.” He seems to have known he was aiming at a moving target. The\ndictionary maker’s “labor,” he wrote in his preface, “would find no end, since\nour English tongue daily changes habit.” Blount’s definitions were much more\nelaborate than Cawdrey’s, and he tried to provide information about the\norigins of words as well.\n\nNeither Bullokar nor Blount so much as mentioned Cawdrey. He was already\nforgotten. But in 1933, upon the publication of the greatest word book of all,\nthe first editors of the _Oxford English Dictionary_ did pay their respects to\nhis “slim, small volume.” They called it “the original acorn” from which their\noak had grown. (Cawdrey: “**akecorne** , _k_ fruit.”)\n\nFour hundred and two years after the _Table Alphabeticall_ , the International\nAstronomical Union voted to declare Pluto a nonplanet, and John Simpson had to\nmake a quick decision. He and his band of lexicographers in Oxford were\nworking on the _P_ ’s. _Pletzel, plish, pod person, point-and-shoot_ , and\n_polyamorous_ were among the new words entering the _OED_. The entry for Pluto\nwas itself relatively new. The planet had been discovered only in 1930, too\nlate for the _OED_ ’s first edition. The name Minerva was first proposed and\nthen rejected because there was already an asteroid Minerva. In terms of\nnames, the heavens were beginning to fill up. Then “Pluto” was suggested by\nVenetia Burney, an eleven-year-old resident of Oxford. The _OED_ caught up by\nadding an entry for Pluto in its second edition: “1. A small planet of the\nsolar system lying beyond the orbit of Neptune … 2. The name of a cartoon dog\nthat made its first appearance in Walt Disney’s _Moose Hunt_ , released in\nApril 1931.”\n\n“We really don’t like being pushed into\nmegachanges,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1173592) Simpson said, but he had\nlittle choice. The Disney meaning of _Pluto_ had proved more stable than the\nastronomical sense, which was downgraded to “small planetary body.”\nConsequences rippled through the _OED_. _Pluto_ was removed from the list\nunder _planet n_. 3a. _Plutonian_ was revised (not to be confused with\n_pluton_ , _plutey_ , or _plutonyl_).\n\nSimpson was the sixth in a distinguished line, the editors of the _Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary_ , whose names rolled fluently off his tongue—“Murray,\nBradley, Craigie, Onions, Burchfield, so however many fingers that is”—and saw\nhimself as a steward of their traditions, as well as traditions of English\nlexicography extending back to Cawdrey by way of Samuel Johnson. James Murray\nin the nineteenth century established a working method based on index cards,\nslips of paper 6 inches by 4 inches. At any given moment a thousand such slips\nsat on Simpson’s desk, and within a stone’s throw were millions more, filling\nmetal files and wooden boxes with the ink of two centuries. But the word-slips\nhad gone obsolete. They had become treeware. _Treeware_ had just entered the\n_OED_ as “computing slang, freq. humorous”; _blog_ was recognized in 2003,\n_dot-commer_ in 2004, _cyberpet_ in 2005, and the verb _to Google_ in 2006.\nSimpson himself Googled often. Beside the word-slips his desk held conduits\ninto the nervous system of the language: instantaneous connection to a\nworldwide network of proxy amateur lexicographers and access to a vast,\ninterlocking set of databases growing asymptotically toward the ideal of All\nPrevious Text. The dictionary had met cyberspace, and neither would be the\nsame thereafter. However much Simpson loved the _OED_ ’s roots and legacy, he\nwas leading a revolution, willy-nilly—in what it was, what it knew, what it\nsaw. Where Cawdrey had been isolated, Simpson was connected.\n\nThe English language, spoken now by more than a billion people globally, has\nentered a period of ferment, and the perspective available in these venerable\nOxford offices is both intimate and sweeping. The language upon which the\nlexicographers eavesdrop has become wild and amorphous: a great, swirling,\nexpanding cloud of messaging and speech; newspapers, magazines, pamphlets;\nmenus and business memos; Internet news groups and chat-room conversations;\ntelevision and radio broadcasts and phonograph records. By contrast, the\ndictionary itself has acquired the status of a monument, definitive and\ntowering. It exerts an influence on the language it tries to observe. It wears\nits authoritative role reluctantly. The lexicographers may recall Ambrose\nBierce’s sardonic century-old definition: “**dictionary** , a malevolent\nliterary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and\ninelastic.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1173821) Nowadays they stress that\nthey do not presume (or deign) to disapprove any particular usage or spelling.\nBut they cannot disavow a strong ambition: the goal of completeness. They want\nevery word, all the lingo: idioms and euphemisms, sacred or profane, dead or\nalive, the King’s English or the street’s. It is an ideal only: the\nconstraints of space and time are ever present and, at the margins, the\nquestion of what qualifies as a word can become impossible to answer. Still,\nto the extent possible, the _OED_ is meant to be a perfect record, perfect\nmirror of the language.\n\nThe dictionary ratifies the persistence of the word. It declares that the\nmeanings of words come from other words. It implies that all words, taken\ntogether, form an interlocking structure: interlocking, because all words are\ndefined in terms of other words. This could never have been an issue in an\noral culture, where language was barely visible. Only when printing—and the\ndictionary—put the language into separate relief, as an object to be\nscrutinized, could anyone develop a sense of word meaning as interdependent\nand even circular. Words had to be considered as words, representing other\nwords, apart from things. In the twentieth century, when the technologies of\nlogic advanced to high levels, the potential for circularity became a problem.\n“In giving explanations I already have to use language full\nblown,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1174142) complained Ludwig Wittgenstein.\nHe echoed Newton’s frustration three centuries earlier, but with an extra\ntwist, because where Newton wanted words for nature’s laws, Wittgenstein\nwanted words for words: “When I talk about language (words, sentences, etc.) I\nmust speak the language of every day. Is this language somehow too coarse and\nmaterial for what we want to say?” Yes. And the language was always in flux.\n\nJames Murray was speaking of the language as well as the book when he said, in\n1900, “The English Dictionary, like the English Constitution, is the creation\nof no one man, and of no one age; it is a growth that has slowly developed\nitself adown the ages.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1174458) The first\nedition of what became the _OED_ was one of the largest books that had ever\nbeen made: _A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles_ , 414,825 words\nin ten weighty volumes, presented to King George V and President Calvin\nCoolidge in 1928. The work had taken decades; Murray himself was dead; and the\ndictionary was understood to be out of date even as the volumes were bound and\nsewn. Several supplements followed, but not till 1989 did the second edition\nappear: twenty volumes, totaling 22,000 pages. It weighed 138 pounds. The\nthird edition is different. It is weightless, taking its shape in the digital\nrealm. It may never again involve paper and ink. Beginning in the year 2000, a\nrevision of the entire contents began to appear online in quarterly\ninstallments, each comprising several thousand revised entries and hundreds of\nnew words.\n\nCawdrey had begun work naturally enough with the letter _A_ , and so had James\nMurray in 1879, but Simpson chose to begin with _M_. He was wary of the _A_\n’s. To insiders it had long been clear that the _OED_ as printed was not a\nseamless masterpiece. The early letters still bore scars of the immaturity of\nthe uncertain work in Murray’s first days. “Basically he got here, sorted his\nsuitcases out and started setting up text,” Simpson said. “It just took them a\nlong time to sort out their policy and things, so if we started at A, then\nwe’d be making our job doubly difficult. I think they’d sorted themselves out\nby … well, I was going to say D, but Murray always said that E was the worst\nletter, because his assistant, Henry Bradley, started E, and Murray always\nsaid that he did that rather badly. So then we thought, maybe it’s safe to\nstart with G, H. But you get to G and H and there’s I, J, K, and you know, you\nthink, well, start after that.”\n\nThe first thousand entries from _M_ to _mahurat_ went online in the spring of\n2000. A year later, the lexicographers reached words starting with _me: me-\nism_ (a creed for modern times), _meds_ (colloq. for drugs), _medspeak_\n(doctors’ jargon), _meet-and-greet_ (a N. Amer. type of social occasion), and\nan assortment of combined forms under _media_ (baron, circus, darling, hype,\nsavvy) and _mega-_ (pixel, bitch, dose, hit, trend). This was no longer a\nlanguage spoken by 5 million mostly illiterate inhabitants of a small island.\nAs the _OED_ revised the entries letter by letter, it also began adding\nneologisms wherever they arose; waiting for the alphabetical sequence became\nimpractical. Thus one installment in 2001 saw the arrival of _acid jazz,\nBollywood, channel surfing, double-click, emoticon, feel-good, gangsta,\nhyperlink_ , and many more. _Kool-Aid_ was recognized as a new word, not\nbecause the _OED_ feels obliged to list proprietary names (the original Kool-\nAde powdered drink had been patented in the United States in 1927) but because\na special usage could no longer be ignored: “to drink the Kool-Aid: to\ndemonstrate unquestioning obedience or loyalty.” The growth of this peculiar\nexpression since the use of a powdered beverage in a mass poisoning in Guyana\nin 1978 bespoke a certain density of global communication.\n\nBut they were no slaves to fashion, these Oxford lexicographers. As a rule a\nneologism needs five years of solid evidence for admission to the canon. Every\nproposed word undergoes intense scrutiny. The approval of a new word is a\nsolemn matter. It must be in general use, beyond any particular place of\norigin; the _OED_ is global, recognizing words from everywhere English is\nspoken, but it does not want to capture local quirks. Once added, a word\ncannot come out. A word can go obsolete or rare, but the most ancient and\nforgotten words have a way of reappearing—rediscovered or spontaneously\nreinvented—and in any case they are part of the language’s history. All 2,500\nof Cawdrey’s words are in the _OED_ , perforce. For thirty-one of them\nCawdrey’s little book was the first known usage. For a few Cawdrey is all\nalone. This is troublesome. The _OED_ is irrevocably committed. Cawdrey, for\nexample, has “**onust** , loaden, overcharged”; so the _OED_ has “loaded,\nburdened,” but it is an outlier, a one-off. Did Cawdrey make it up? “I’m\ntending towards the view that he was attempting to reproduce vocabulary he had\nheard or seen,” Simpson said. “But I can’t be absolutely sure.” Cawdrey has\n“**hallucinate** , to deceive, or blind”; the _OED_ duly gave “to deceive” as\nthe first sense of the word, though it never found anyone else who used it\nthat way. In cases like these, the editors can add their double caveat “ _Obs.\nrare_.” But there it is.\n\nFor the twenty-first-century _OED_ a single source is never enough. Strangely,\nconsidering the vastness of the enterprise and its constituency, individual\nmen and women strive to have their own nonce-words ratified by the _OED_.\n_Nonce-word_ , in fact, was coined by James Murray himself. He got it in. An\nAmerican psychologist, Sondra Smalley, coined the word _codependency_ in 1979\nand began lobbying for it in the eighties; the editors finally drafted an\nentry in the nineties, when they judged the word to have become established.\nW. H. Auden declared that he wanted to be recognized as an _OED_ word\ncoiner—and he was, at long last, for _motted_ , _metalogue_ , _spitzy_ , and\nothers.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1174755) The dictionary had thus become\nengaged in a feedback loop. It inspired a twisty self-consciousness in the\nlanguage’s users and creators. Anthony Burgess whinged in print about his\ninability to break through: “I invented some years ago the word _amation_ ,\nfor the art or act of making love, and still think it useful. But I have to\npersuade others to use it _in print_ before it is eligible for\nlexicographicizing (if that word\nexists)”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1175042)—he knew it did not. “T. S.\nEliot’s large authority got the shameful (in my view) _juvescence_ into the\nprevious volume of the Supplement.” Burgess was quite sure that Eliot simply\nmisspelled _juvenescence_. If so, the misspelling was either copied or\nreprised twenty-eight years later by Stephen Spender, so _juvescence_ has two\ncitations, not one. The _OED_ admits that it is rare.\n\nAs hard as the _OED_ tries to embody the language’s fluidity, it cannot help\nbut serve as an agent of its crystallization. The problem of spelling poses\ncharacteristic difficulties. “ _Every_ form in which a word has occurred\nthroughout its history”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1175453) is meant to be\nincluded. So for _mackerel_ (“a well-known sea-fish, _Scomber scombrus_ , much\nused for food”) the second edition in 1989 listed nineteen alternative\nspellings. The unearthing of sources never ends, though, so the third edition\nrevised entry in 2002 listed no fewer than thirty: _maccarel, mackaral,\nmackarel, mackarell, mackerell, mackeril, mackreel, mackrel, mackrell,\nmackril, macquerel, macquerell, macrel, macrell, macrelle, macril, macrill,\nmakarell, makcaral, makerel, makerell, makerelle, makral, makrall, makreill,\nmakrel, makrell, makyrelle, maquerel_ , and _maycril_. As lexicographers, the\neditors would never declare these alternatives to be wrong: misspellings. They\ndo not wish to declare their choice of spelling for the headword, _mackerel_ ,\nto be “correct.” They emphasize that they examine the evidence and choose “the\nmost common current spelling.” Even so, arbitrary considerations come into\nplay: “Oxford’s house style occasionally takes precedence, as with verbs which\ncan end -ize or -ise, where the -ize spelling is always used.” They know that\nno matter how often and how firmly they disclaim a prescriptive authority, a\nreader will turn to the dictionary to find out how a word should be spelled.\nThey cannot escape inconsistencies. They feel obliged to include words that\nmake purists wince. A new entry as of December 2003 memorialized _nucular_ :\n“= nuclear _a_. (in various senses).” Yet they refuse to count evident\nmisprints found by way of Internet searches. They do not recognize _straight-\nlaced_ , even though statistical evidence finds that bastardized form\noutnumbering _strait-laced_. For the crystallization of spelling, the _OED_\noffers a conventional explanation: “Since the invention of the printing press,\nspelling has become much less variable, partly because printers wanted\nuniformity and partly because of a growing interest in language study during\nthe Renaissance.” This is true. But it omits the role of the dictionary\nitself, arbitrator and exemplar.\n\nFor Cawdrey the dictionary was a snapshot; he could not see past his moment in\ntime. Samuel Johnson was more explicitly aware of the dictionary’s historical\ndimension. He justified his ambitious program in part as a means of bringing a\nwild thing under control—the wild thing being the language, “which, while it\nwas employed in the cultivation of every species of literature, has itself\nbeen hitherto neglected; suffered to spread, under the direction of chance,\ninto wild exuberance; resigned to the tyranny of time and fashion; and exposed\nto the corruptions of ignorance, and caprices of\ninnovation.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1175883) Not until the _OED_ ,\nthough, did lexicography attempt to reveal the whole shape of a language\nacross time. The _OED_ becomes a historical panorama. The project gains\npoignancy if the electronic age is seen as a new age of orality, the word\nbreaking free from the bonds of cold print. No publishing institution better\nembodies those bonds, but the _OED_ , too, tries to throw them off. The\neditors feel they can no longer wait for a new word to appear in print, let\nalone in a respectably bound book, before they must take note. For _tighty-\nwhities_ (men’s underwear), new in 2007, they cite a typescript of North\nCarolina campus slang. For _kitesurfer_ , they cite a posting to the Usenet\nnewsgroup alt.kite and later a New Zealand newspaper found via an online\ndatabase. Bits in the ether.\n\nWhen Murray began work on the new dictionary, the idea was to find the words,\nand with them the signposts to their history. No one had any idea how many\nwords were there to be found. By then the best and most comprehensive\ndictionary of English was American: Noah Webster’s, seventy thousand words.\nThat was a baseline. Where were the rest to be discovered? For the first\neditors of what became the _OED_ , it went almost without saying that the\nsource, the wellspring, should be the literature of the language—particularly\nthe books of distinction and quality. The dictionary’s first readers combed\nMilton and Shakespeare (still the single most quoted author, with more than\nthirty thousand references), Fielding and Swift, histories and sermons,\nphilosophers and poets. Murray announced in a famous public appeal in 1879:\n\n> > A thousand readers are wanted. The later sixteenth-century literature is\n> very fairly done; yet here several books remain to be read. The seventeenth\n> century, with so many more writers, naturally shows still more unexplored\n> territory.\n\nHe considered the territory to be large but bounded. The founders of the\ndictionary explicitly meant to find every word, however many that would\nultimately be. They planned a complete inventory. Why should they not? The\nnumber of books was unknown but not unlimited, and the number of words in\nthose books was countable. The task seemed formidable but finite.\n\nIt no longer seems finite. Lexicographers are accepting the language’s\nboundlessness. They know by heart Murray’s famous remark: “The circle of the\nEnglish language has a well-defined centre but no discernable circumference.”\nIn the center are the words everyone knows. At the edges, where Murray placed\nslang and cant and scientific jargon and foreign border crossers, everyone’s\nsense of the language differs and no one’s can be called “standard.”\n\nMurray called the center “well defined,” but infinitude and fuzziness can be\nseen there. The easiest, most common words—the words Cawdrey had no thought of\nincluding—require, in the _OED_ , the most extensive entries. The entry for\n_make_ alone would fill a book: it teases apart ninety-eight distinct senses\nof the verb, and some of these senses have a dozen or more subsenses. Samuel\nJohnson saw the problem with these words and settled on a solution: he threw\nup his hands.\n\n> > My labor has likewise been much increased by a class of verbs too frequent\n> in the English language, of which the signification is so loose and general,\n> the use so vague and indeterminate, and the senses detorted so widely from\n> the first idea, that it is hard to trace them through the maze of variation,\n> to catch them on the brink of utter inanity, to circumscribe them by any\n> limitations, or interpret them by any words of distinct and settled meaning;\n> such are _bear, break, come, cast, full, get, give, do, put, set, go, run,\n> make, take, turn, throw_. If of these the whole power is not accurately\n> delivered, it must be remembered, that while our language is yet living, and\n> variable by the caprice of every one that speaks it, these words are hourly\n> shifting their relations, and can no more be ascertained in a dictionary,\n> than a grove, in the agitation of a storm, can be accurately delineated from\n> its picture in the water.\n\nJohnson had a point. These are words that any speaker of English can press\ninto new service at any time, on any occasion, alone or in combination,\ninventively or not, with hopes of being understood. In every revision, the\n_OED_ ’s entry for a word like _make_ subdivides further and thus grows\nlarger. The task is unbounded in an inward-facing direction.\n\nThe more obvious kind of unboundedness appears at the edges. Neologism never\nceases. Words are coined by committee: _transistor_ , Bell Laboratories, 1948.\nOr by wags: _booboisie_ , H. L. Mencken, 1922. Most arise through spontaneous\ngeneration, organisms appearing in a petri dish, like _blog_ (c. 1999). One\nbatch of arrivals includes _agroterrorism_ , _bada-bing_ , _bahookie_ (a body\npart), _beer pong_ (a drinking game), _bippy_ (as in, you bet your ———),\n_chucklesome_ , _cypherpunk_ , _tuneage_ , and _wonky_. None are what Cawdrey\nwould have seen as “hard, usual words,” and none are anywhere near Murray’s\nwell-defined center, but they now belong to the common language. Even _bada-\nbing:_ “Suggesting something happening suddenly, emphatically, or easily and\npredictably; ‘Just like that!’, ‘Presto!’ ” The historical citations begin\nwith a 1965 audio recording of a comedy routine by Pat Cooper and continue\nwith newspaper clippings, a television news transcript, and a line of dialogue\nfrom the first _Godfather_ movie: “You’ve gotta get up close like this and\nbada-bing! you blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit.” The\nlexicographers also provide an etymology, an exquisite piece of guesswork:\n“Origin uncertain. Perh. imitative of the sound of a drum roll and cymbal\nclash. Perh. cf. Italian _bada bene_ mark well.”\n\nThe English language no longer has such a thing as a geographic center, if it\never did. The universe of human discourse always has backwaters. The language\nspoken in one valley diverges from the language of the next valley, and so on.\nThere are more valleys now than ever, even if the valleys are not so isolated.\n“We are listening to the language,” said Peter Gilliver, an _OED_\nlexicographer and resident historian. “When you are listening to the language\nby collecting pieces of paper, that’s fine, but now it’s as if we can hear\neverything said anywhere. Take an expatriate community living in a non-\nEnglish-speaking part of the world, expatriates who live at Buenos Aires or\nsomething. Their English, the English that they speak to one another every\nday, is full of borrowings from local Spanish. And so they would regard those\nwords as part of their idiolect, their personal vocabulary.” Only now they may\nalso speak in chat rooms and on blogs. When they coin a word, anyone may hear.\nThen it may or may not become part of the language.\n\nIf there is an ultimate limit to the sensitivity of lexicographers’ ears, no\none has yet found it. Spontaneous coinages can have an audience of one. They\ncan be as ephemeral as atomic particles in a bubble chamber. But many\nneologisms require a level of shared cultural knowledge. Perhaps _bada-bing_\nwould not truly have become part of twenty-first-century English had it not\nbeen for the common experience of viewers of a particular American television\nprogram (though it is not cited by the _OED_).\n\nThe whole word hoard—the lexis—constitutes a symbol set of the language. It is\nthe fundamental symbol set, in one way: words are the first units of meaning\nany language recognizes. They are recognized universally. But in another way\nit is far from fundamental: as communication evolves, messages in a language\ncan be broken down and composed and transmitted in much smaller sets of\nsymbols: the alphabet; dots and dashes; drumbeats high and low. These symbol\nsets are discrete. The lexis is not. It is messier. It keeps on growing.\nLexicography turns out to be a science poorly suited to exact measurement.\nEnglish, the largest and most widely shared language, can be said very roughly\nto possess a number of units of meaning that approaches a million. Linguists\nhave no special yardsticks of their own; when they try to quantify the pace of\nneologism, they tend to look to the dictionary for guidance, and even the best\ndictionary runs from that responsibility. The edges always blur. A clear line\ncannot be drawn between word and unword.\n\nSo we count as we can. Robert Cawdrey’s little book, making no pretense to\ncompleteness, contained a vocabulary of only 2,500. We possess now a more\ncomplete dictionary of English as it was circa 1600: the subset of the _OED_\ncomprising words then current.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1176156) That\nvocabulary numbers 60,000 and keeps growing, because the discovery of\nsixteenth-century sources never ends. Even so, it is a tiny fraction of the\nwords used four centuries later. The explanation for this explosive growth,\nfrom 60,000 to a million, is not simple. Much of what now needs naming did not\nyet exist, of course. And much of what existed was not recognized. There was\nno call for _transistor_ in 1600, nor _nanobacterium_ , nor _webcam_ , nor\n_fen-phen_. Some of the growth comes from mitosis. The guitar divides into the\nelectric and the acoustic; other words divide in reflection of delicate\nnuances (as of March 2007 the _OED_ assigned a new entry to _prevert_ as a\nform of _pervert_ , taking the view that _prevert_ was not just an error but a\ndeliberately humorous effect). Other new words appear without any\ncorresponding innovation in the world of real things. They crystallize in the\nsolvent of universal information.\n\nWhat, in the world, is a _mondegreen_? It is a misheard lyric, as when, for\nexample, the Christian hymn is heard as “Lead on, O kinky turtle …”). In\nsifting the evidence, the _OED_ first cites a 1954 essay in _Harper’s\nMagazine_ by Sylvia Wright: “What I shall hereafter call mondegreens, since no\none else has thought up a word for\nthem.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1176388) She explained the idea and the\nword this way:\n\n> > When I was a child, my mother used to read aloud to me from Percy’s\n> Reliques, and one of my favorite poems began, as I remember:\n\n> _Ye Highlands and ye Lowlands_ ,\n>\n> _Oh, where hae ye been_?\n>\n> _They hae slain the Earl Amurray_ ,\n>\n> _And Lady Mondegreen_.\n\nThere the word lay, for some time. A quarter-century later, William Safire\ndiscussed the word in a column about language in _The New York Times\nMagazine_. Fifteen years after that, Steven Pinker, in his book _The Language\nInstinct_ , offered a brace of examples, from “A girl with colitis goes by” to\n“Gladly the cross-eyed bear,” and observed, “The interesting thing about\nmondegreens is that the mishearings are generally _less_ plausible than the\nintended lyrics.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1176672) But it was not books\nor magazines that gave the word its life; it was Internet sites, compiling\nmondegreens by the thousands. The _OED_ recognized the word in June 2004.\n\nA mondegreen is not a transistor, inherently modern. Its modernity is harder\nto explain. The ingredients—songs, words, and imperfect understanding—are all\nas old as civilization. Yet for mondegreens to arise in the culture, and for\n_mondegreen_ to exist in the lexis, required something new: a modern level of\nlinguistic self-consciousness and interconnectedness. People needed to mishear\nlyrics not just once, not just several times, but often enough to become aware\nof the mishearing as a thing worth discussing. They needed to have other such\npeople with whom to share the recognition. Until the most modern times,\nmondegreens, like countless other cultural or psychological phenomena, simply\ndid not need to be named. Songs themselves were not so common; not heard,\nanyway, on elevators and mobile phones. The word _lyrics_ , meaning the words\nof a song, did not exist until the nineteenth century. The conditions for\nmondegreens took a long time to ripen. Similarly, the verb _to gaslight_ now\nmeans “to manipulate a person by psychological means into questioning his or\nher own sanity”; it exists only because enough people saw the 1944 film of\nthat title and could assume that their listeners had seen it, too. Might not\nthe language Cawdrey spoke—which was, after all, the abounding and fertile\nlanguage of Shakespeare—have found use for such a word? No matter: the\ntechnology for _gaslight_ had not been invented. Nor had the technology for\nmotion pictures.\n\nThe lexis is a measure of shared experience, which comes from\ninterconnectedness. The number of users of the language forms only the first\npart of the equation: jumping in four centuries from 5 million English\nspeakers to a billion. The driving factor is the number of connections between\nand among those speakers. A mathematician might say that messaging grows not\ngeometrically, but combinatorially, which is much, much faster. “I think of it\nas a saucepan under which the temperature has been turned up,” Gilliver said.\n“Any word, because of the interconnectedness of the English-speaking world,\ncan spring from the backwater. And they are still backwaters, but they have\nthis instant connection to ordinary, everyday discourse.” Like the printing\npress, the telegraph, and the telephone before it, the Internet is\ntransforming the language simply by transmitting information differently. What\nmakes cyberspace different from all previous information technologies is its\nintermixing of scales from the largest to the smallest without prejudice,\nbroadcasting to the millions, narrowcasting to groups, instant messaging one\nto one.\n\nThis comes as quite an unexpected consequence of the invention of computing\nmachinery. At first, that had seemed to be about numbers.\n\n\n# 4 | TO THROW THE POWERS OF THOUGHT INTO WHEEL-WORK[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1177105)\n\n\n##\n\n> (Lo, the Raptured Arithmetician)\n\n> _Light almost solar has been extracted from the refuse of fish; fire has\n> been sifted by the lamp of Davy; and machinery has been taught arithmetic\n> instead of poetry._\n\n> —Charles Babbage (1832)[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1179161)\n\nNO ONE DOUBTED THAT Charles Babbage was brilliant. Nor did anyone quite\nunderstand the nature of his genius, which remained out of focus for a long\ntime. What did he hope to achieve? For that matter, what, exactly, was his\nvocation? On his death in London in 1871 the _Times_ obituarist declared him\n“one of the most active and original of original\nthinkers”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1179573) but seemed to feel he was\nbest known for his long, cranky crusade against street musicians and organ-\ngrinders. He might not have minded. He was multifarious and took pride in it.\n“He showed great desire to inquire into the causes of things that astonish\nchildish minds,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1180101) said an American\neulogist. “He eviscerated toys to ascertain their manner of working.” Babbage\ndid not quite belong in his time, which called itself the Steam Age or the\nMachine Age. He did revel in the uses of steam and machinery and considered\nhimself a thoroughly modern man, but he also pursued an assortment of hobbies\nand obsessions—cipher cracking, lock picking, lighthouses, tree rings, the\npost—whose logic became clearer a century later. Examining the economics of\nthe mail, he pursued a counterintuitive insight, that the significant cost\ncomes not from the physical transport of paper packets but from their\n“verification”—the calculation of distances and the collection of correct\nfees—and thus he invented the modern idea of standardized postal rates. He\nloved boating, by which he meant not “the manual labor of rowing but the more\nintellectual art of sailing.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1180488) He was a\ntrain buff. He devised a railroad recording device that used inking pens to\ntrace curves on sheets of paper a thousand feet long: a combination\nseismograph and speedometer, inscribing the history of a train’s velocity and\nall the bumps and shakes along the way.\n\nAs a young man, stopping at an inn in the north of England, he was amused to\nhear that his fellow travelers had been debating his trade:\n\n> > “The tall gentleman in the corner,” said my informant, “maintained you\n> were in the hardware line; whilst the fat gentleman who sat next to you at\n> supper was quite sure that you were in the spirit trade. Another of the\n> party declared that they were both mistaken: he said you were travelling for\n> a great iron-master.”\n>\n\n>> “Well,” said I, “you, I presume, knew my vocation better than our friends.”\n\n>\n\n>> “Yes,” said my informant, “I knew perfectly well that you were in the\nNottingham lace trade.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1180796)\n\nHe might have been described as a professional mathematician, yet here he was\ntouring the country’s workshops and manufactories, trying to discover the\nstate of the art in machine tools. He noted, “Those who enjoy leisure can\nscarcely find a more interesting and instructive pursuit than the examination\nof the workshops of their own country, which contain within them a rich mine\nof knowledge, too generally neglected by the wealthier\nclasses.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1181026) He himself neglected no vein\nof knowledge. He did become expert on the manufacture of Nottingham lace; also\nthe use of gunpowder in quarrying limestone; precision glass cutting with\ndiamonds; and all known uses of machinery to produce power, save time, and\ncommunicate signals. He analyzed hydraulic presses, air pumps, gas meters, and\nscrew cutters. By the end of his tour he knew as much as anyone in England\nabout the making of pins. His knowledge was practical and methodical. He\nestimated that a pound of pins required the work of ten men and women for at\nleast seven and a half hours, drawing wire, straightening wire, pointing the\nwire, twisting and cutting heads from the spiral coils, tinning or whitening,\nand finally papering. He computed the cost of each phase in millionths of a\npenny.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1181308) And he noted that this process,\nwhen finally perfected, had reached its last days: an American had invented an\nautomatic machine to accomplish the same task, faster.\n\nBabbage invented his own machine, a great, gleaming engine of brass and\npewter, comprising thousands of cranks and rotors, cogs and gearwheels, all\ntooled with the utmost precision. He spent his long life improving it, first\nin one and then in another incarnation, but all, mainly, in his mind. It never\ncame to fruition anywhere else. It thus occupies an extreme and peculiar place\nin the annals of invention: a failure, and also one of humanity’s grandest\nintellectual achievements. It failed on a colossal scale, as a scientific-\nindustrial project “at the expense of the nation, to be held as national\nproperty,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1181482) financed by the Treasury for\nalmost twenty years, beginning in 1823 with a Parliamentary appropriation of\n£1,500 and ending in 1842, when the prime minister shut it down. Later,\nBabbage’s engine was forgotten. It vanished from the lineage of invention.\nLater still, however, it was rediscovered, and it became influential in\nretrospect, to shine as a beacon from the past.\n\nLike the looms, forges, naileries, and glassworks he studied in his travels\nacross northern England, Babbage’s machine was designed to manufacture vast\nquantities of a certain commodity. The commodity was numbers. The engine\nopened a channel from the corporeal world of matter to a world of pure\nabstraction. The engine consumed no raw materials—input and output being\nweightless—but needed a considerable force to turn the gears. All that wheel-\nwork would fill a room and weigh several tons. Producing numbers, as Babbage\nconceived it, required a degree of mechanical complexity at the very limit of\navailable technology. Pins were easy, compared with numbers.\n\nIt was not natural to think of numbers as a manufactured commodity. They\nexisted in the mind, or in ideal abstraction, in their perfect infinitude. No\nmachine could add to the world’s supply. The numbers produced by Babbage’s\nengine were meant to be those with significance: numbers with a meaning. For\nexample, 2.096910013 has a meaning, as the logarithm of 125. (Whether _every_\nnumber has a meaning would be a conundrum for the next century.) The meaning\nof a number could be expressed as a relationship to other numbers, or as the\nanswer to a certain question of arithmetic. Babbage himself did not speak in\nterms of meaning; he tried to explain his engine pragmatically, in terms of\nputting numbers into the machine and seeing other numbers come out, or, a bit\nmore fancifully, in terms of posing questions to the machine and expecting an\nanswer. Either way, he had trouble getting the point across. He grumbled:\n\n> > On two occasions I have been asked,—“Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into\n> the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?” In one case a\n> member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the Lower, House put this\n> question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas\n> that could provoke such a question.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1181849)\n\nAnyway, the machine was not meant to be a sort of oracle, to be consulted by\nindividuals who would travel from far and wide for mathematical answers. The\nengine’s chief mission was to print out numbers en masse. For portability, the\nfacts of arithmetic could be expressed in tables and bound in books.\n\nTo Babbage the world seemed made of such facts. They were the “constants of\nNature and Art.” He collected them everywhere. He compiled a Table of\nConstants of the Class Mammalia: wherever he went he timed the breaths and\nheartbeats of pigs and cows.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1182099) He\ninvented a statistical methodology with tables of life expectancy for the\nsomewhat shady business of life insurance. He drew up a table of the weight in\nTroy grains per square yard of various fabrics: cambric, calico, nankeen,\nmuslins, silk gauze, and “caterpillar veils.” Another table revealed the\nrelative frequencies of all the double-letter combinations in English, French,\nItalian, German, and Latin. He researched, computed, and published a Table of\nthe Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breaking of Plate Glass Windows,\ndistinguishing 464 different causes, no less than fourteen of which involved\n“drunken men, women, or boys.” But the tables closest to his heart were the\npurest: tables of numbers and only numbers, marching neatly across and down\nthe pages in stately rows and columns, patterns for abstract appreciation.\n\nA book of numbers: amid all the species of information technology, how\npeculiar and powerful an object this is. “Lo! the raptured\narithmetician!”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1182425) wrote Élie de Joncourt\nin 1762. “Easily satisfied, he asks no Brussels lace, nor a coach and six.”\nJoncourt’s own contribution was a small quarto volume registering the first\n19,999 triangular numbers. It was a treasure box of exactitude, perfection,\nand close reckoning. These numbers were so simple, just the sums of the first\n_n_ whole numbers: 1, 3 (1+2), 6 (1+2+3), 10 (1+2+3+4), 15, 21, 28, and so on.\nThey had interested number theorists since Pythagoras. They offered little in\nthe way of utility, but Joncourt rhapsodized about his pleasure in compiling\nthem and Babbage quoted him with heartfelt sympathy: “Numbers have many\ncharms, unseen by vulgar eyes, and only discovered to the unwearied and\nrespectful sons of Art. Sweet joy may arise from such contemplations.”\n\nTables of numbers had been part of the book business even before the beginning\nof the print era. Working in Baghdad in the ninth century, Abu Abdullah\nMohammad Ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose name survives in the word _algorithm_ ,\ndevised tables of trigonometric functions that spread west across Europe and\neast to China, made by hand and copied by hand, for hundreds of years.\nPrinting brought number tables into their own: they were a natural first\napplication for the mass production of data in the raw. For people in need of\narithmetic, multiplication tables covered more and more territory: 10 × 1,000,\nthen 10 × 10,000, and later as far as 1,000 × 1,000. There were tables of\nsquares and cubes, roots and reciprocals. An early form of table was the\nephemeris or almanac, listing positions of the sun, moon, and planets for sky-\ngazers. Tradespeople found uses for number books. In 1582 Simon Stevin\nproduced _Tafelen van Interest_ , a compendium of interest tables for bankers\nand moneylenders. He promoted the new decimal arithmetic “to astrologers,\nland-measurers, measurers of tapestry and wine casks and stereometricians, in\ngeneral, mint masters and merchants\nall.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1182817) He might have added sailors. When\nChristopher Columbus set off for the Indies, he carried as an aid to\nnavigation a book of tables by Regiomontanus printed in Nuremberg two decades\nafter the invention of moveable type in Europe.\n\nJoncourt’s book of triangular numbers was purer than any of these—which is\nalso to say useless. Any arbitrary triangular number can be found (or made) by\nan algorithm: multiply _n_ by _n_ \\+ 1 and divide by 2. So Joncourt’s whole\ncompendium, as a bundle of information to be stored and transmitted, collapses\nin a puff to a one-line formula. The formula contains all the information.\nWith it, anyone capable of simple multiplication (not many were) could\ngenerate any triangular number on demand. Joncourt knew this. Still he and his\npublisher, M. Husson, at the Hague, found it worthwhile to set the tables in\nmetal type, three pairs of columns to a page, each pair listing thirty natural\nnumbers alongside their corresponding triangular numbers, from 1(1) to\n19,999(199,990,000), every numeral chosen individually by the compositor from\nhis cases of metal type and lined up in a galley frame and wedged into an iron\nchase to be placed upon the press.\n\nWhy? Besides the obsession and the ebullience, the creators of number tables\nhad a sense of their economic worth. Consciously or not, they reckoned the\nprice of these special data by weighing the difficulty of computing them\nversus looking them up in a book. Precomputation plus data storage plus data\ntransmission usually came out cheaper than ad hoc computation. “Computers” and\n“calculators” existed: they were people with special skills, and all in all,\ncomputing was costly.\n\nBeginning in 1767, England’s Board of Longitude ordered published a yearly\n_Nautical Almanac_ , with position tables for the sun, moon, stars, planets,\nand moons of Jupiter. Over the next half century a network of computers did\nthe work—thirty-four men and one woman, Mary Edwards of Ludlow, Shropshire,\nall working from their homes.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1183220) Their\npainstaking labor paid £70 a year. Computing was a cottage industry. Some\nmathematical sense was required but no particular genius; rules were laid out\nin steps for each type of calculation. In any case the computers, being human,\nmade errors, so the same work was often farmed out twice for the sake of\nredundancy. (Unfortunately, being human, computers were sometimes caught\nsaving themselves labor by copying from one other.) To manage the information\nflow the project employed a Comparer of the Ephemeris and Corrector of the\nProofs. Communication between the computers and comparer went by post, men on\nfoot or on horseback, a few days per message.\n\nA seventeenth-century invention had catalyzed the whole enterprise. This\ninvention was itself a species of number, given the name _logarithm_. It was\nnumber as tool. Henry Briggs explained:\n\n> > Logarithmes are Numbers invented for the more easie working of questions\n> in Arithmetike and Geometrie. The name is derived of _Logos_ , which\n> signifies _Reason_ , and _Arithmos_ , signifying _Numbers_. By them all\n> troublesome Multiplications and Divisions in Arithmetike are avoided, and\n> performed onely by Addition in stead of Multiplication, and by Subtraction\n> in stead of Division.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1183793)\n\nIn 1614 Briggs was a professor of geometry—the first professor of geometry—at\nGresham College, London, later to be the birthplace of the Royal Society.\nWithout logarithms he had already created two books of tables, _A Table to\nfind the Height of the Pole, the Magnetic Declination being given_ and _Tables\nfor the Improvement of Navigation_ , when a book came from Edinburgh promising\nto “take away all the difficultie that heretofore hath beene in mathematical\ncalculations.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1184125)\n\n> > There is nothing (right well beloved Students in the Mathematickes) that\n> is so troublesome to Mathematicall practice, not that doth more molest and\n> hinder Calculators, then the Multiplications, Divisions, square and cubical\n> Extractions of great numbers, which besides the tedious expence of time, are\n> for the most part subject to many slippery errors.\n\nThis new book proposed a method that would do away with most of the expense\nand the errors. It was like an electric flashlight sent to a lightless world.\nThe author was a wealthy Scotsman, John Napier (or Napper, Nepair, Naper, or\nNeper), the eighth laird of Merchiston Castle, a theologian and well-known\nastrologer who also made a hobby of mathematics. Briggs was agog. “Naper, lord\nof Markinston, hath set my head and hands a\nwork,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1184461) he wrote. “I hope to see him\nthis summer, if it please God, for I never saw book, which pleased me better,\nand made me more wonder.” He made his pilgrimage to Scotland and their first\nmeeting, as he reported later, began with a quarter hour of silence: “spent,\neach beholding other almost with admiration before one word was\nspoke.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1184866)\n\nBriggs broke the trance: “My Lord, I have undertaken this long journey\npurposely to see your person, and to know by what engine of wit or ingenuity\nyou came first to think of this most excellent help unto astronomy, viz. the\nLogarithms; but, my Lord, being by you found out, I wonder nobody else found\nit out before, when now known it is so easy.” He stayed with the laird for\nseveral weeks, studying.\n\nIn modern terms a logarithm is an exponent. A student learns that the\nlogarithm of 100, using 10 as the base, is 2, because 100 = 102. The logarithm\nof 1,000,000 is 6, because 6 is the exponent in the expression 1,000,000 =\n106. To multiply two numbers, a calculator could just look up their logarithms\nand add those. For example:\n\n> 100 × 1,000,000 = 102 × 106 = 10(2 + 6)\n\nLooking up and adding are easier than multiplying.\n\nBut Napier did not express his idea this way, in terms of exponents. He\ngrasped the thing viscerally: he was thinking in terms of a relationship\nbetween differences and ratios. A series of numbers with a fixed difference is\nan arithmetic progression: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 … When the numbers are separated\nby a fixed ratio, the progression is geometric: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 … Set these\nprogressions side by side,\n\n> 0 1 2 3 4 5 … (base 2 logarithms)\n\n> 1 2 4 8 16 32 … (natural numbers)\n\nand the result is a crude table of logarithms—crude, because the whole-number\nexponents are the easy ones. A useful table of logarithms had to fill in the\ngaps, with many decimal places of accuracy.\n\nIn Napier’s mind was an analogy: differences are to ratios as addition is to\nmultiplication. His thinking crossed over from one plane to another, from\nspatial relationships to pure numbers. Aligning these scales side by side, he\ngave a calculator a practical means of converting multiplication into\naddition—downshifting, in effect, from the difficult task to the easier one.\nIn a way, the method is a kind of translation, or encoding. The natural\nnumbers are encoded as logarithms. The calculator looks them up in a table,\nthe code book. In this new language, calculation is easy: addition instead of\nmultiplication, or multiplication instead of exponentiation. When the work is\ndone, the result is translated back into the language of natural numbers.\nNapier, of course, could not think in terms of encoding.\n\nBriggs revised and extended the necessary number sequences and published a\nbook of his own, _Logarithmicall Arithmetike_ , full of pragmatic\napplications. Besides the logarithms he presented tables of latitude of the\nsun’s declination year by year; showed how to find the distance between any\ntwo places, given their latitudes and longitudes; and laid out a star guide\nwith declinations, distance to the pole, and right ascension. Some of this\nrepresented knowledge never compiled and some was oral knowledge making the\ntransition to print, as could be seen in the not-quite-formal names of the\nstars: the _Pole Starre, girdle of Andromeda_ , _Whales Bellie_ , _the\nbrightest in the harpe_ , and _the first in the great Beares taile next her\nrump_.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1185212) Briggs also considered matters\nof finance, offering rules for computing with interest, backward and forward\nin time. The new technology was a watershed: “It may be here also noted that\nthe use of a 100 pound for a day at the rate of 8, 9, 10, or the like for a\nyeare hath beene scarcely known, till by Logarithms it was found out: for\notherwise it requires so many laborious extractions of roots, as will cost\nmore paines than the knowledge of the thing is accompted to be\nworth.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1185452) Knowledge has a value and a\ndiscovery cost, each to be counted and weighed.\n\nEven this exciting discovery took several years to travel as far as Johannes\nKepler, who employed it in perfecting his celestial tables in 1627, based on\nthe laboriously acquired data of Tycho Brahe. “A Scottish baron has appeared\non the scene (his name I have forgotten) who has done an excellent thing,”\nKepler wrote a friend, “transforming all multiplication and division into\naddition and subtraction.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1185661) Kepler’s\ntables were far more accurate—perhaps thirty times more—than any of his\nmedieval predecessors, and the accuracy made possible an entirely new thing,\nhis harmonious heliocentric system, with planets orbiting the sun in ellipses.\nFrom that time until the arrival of electronic machines, the majority of human\ncomputation was performed by means of\nlogarithms.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1185992) A teacher of Kepler’s\nsniffed, “It is not fitting for a professor of mathematics to manifest\nchildish joy just because reckoning is made\neasier.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1186269) But why not? Across the\ncenturies they all felt that joy in reckoning: Napier and Briggs, Kepler and\nBabbage, making their lists, building their towers of ratio and proportion,\nperfecting their mechanisms for transforming numbers into numbers. And then\nthe world’s commerce validated their pleasure.\n\n> Natural Numbers | Logarithms base 2  \n> ---|---  \n> 1 | 0  \n> 2 | 1  \n> 3 | 1.5850  \n> 4 | 2  \n> 5 | 2.3219  \n> 6 | 2.5850  \n> 7 | 2.8074  \n> 8 | 3  \n> 9 | 3.1699  \n> 10 | 3.3219  \n> 11 | 3.4594  \n> 12 | 3.5850  \n> 13 | 3.7004  \n> 14 | 3.8074  \n> 15 | 3.9069  \n> 16 | 4  \n> 17 | 4.0875  \n> 18 | 4.1699  \n> 19 | 4.2479  \n> 20 | 4.3219  \n> 21 | 4.3923  \n> 22 | 4.4594  \n> 23 | 4.5236  \n> 24 | 4.5850  \n> 25 | 4.6439  \n> 26 | 4.7004  \n> 27 | 4.7549  \n> 28 | 4.8074  \n> 29 | 4.8580  \n> 30 | 4.9069  \n> 31 | 4.9542  \n> 32 | 5  \n> 33 | 5.0444  \n> 34 | 5.0875  \n> 35 | 5.1293  \n> 36 | 5.1699  \n> 37 | 5.2095  \n> 38 | 5.2479  \n> 39 | 5.2854  \n> 40 | 5.3219  \n> 41 | 5.3576  \n> 42 | 5.3923  \n> 43 | 5.4263  \n> 44 | 5.4594  \n> 45 | 5.4919  \n> 46 | 5.5236  \n> 47 | 5.5546  \n> 48 | 5.5850  \n> 49 | 5.6147  \n> 50 | 5.6439  \n  \nCharles Babbage was born on Boxing Day 1791, near the end of the century that\nbegan with Newton. His home was on the south side of the River Thames in\nWalworth, Surrey, still a rural hamlet, though the London Bridge was scarcely\na half hour’s walk even for a small boy. He was the son of a banker, who was\nhimself the son and grandson of goldsmiths. In the London of Babbage’s\nchildhood, the Machine Age made itself felt everywhere. A new breed of\nimpresario was showing off machinery in exhibitions. The shows that drew the\nbiggest crowds featured automata—mechanical dolls, ingenious and delicate,\nwith wheels and pinions mimicking life itself. Charles Babbage went with his\nmother to John Merlin’s Mechanical Museum in Hanover Square, full of clockwork\nand music boxes and, most interesting, simulacra of living things. A metal\nswan bent its neck to catch a metal fish, moved by hidden motors and cams. In\nthe artist’s attic workshop Charles saw a pair of naked dancing women, gliding\nand bowing, crafted in silver at one-fifth life size. Merlin himself, their\nelderly creator, said he had devoted years to these machines, his favorites,\nstill unfinished. One of the figurines especially impressed Charles with its\n(or her) grace and seeming liveliness. “This lady attitudinized in a most\nfascinating manner,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1186581) he recalled. “Her\neyes were full of imagination, and irresistible.” Indeed, when he was a man in\nhis forties he found Merlin’s silver dancer at an auction, bought it for £35,\ninstalled it on a pedestal in his home, and dressed its nude form in custom\nfinery.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1186820)\n\nThe boy also loved mathematics—an interest far removed from the mechanical\narts, as it seemed. He taught himself in bits and pieces from such books as he\ncould find. In 1810 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge—Isaac Newton’s\ndomain and still the moral center of mathematics in England. Babbage was\nimmediately disappointed: he discovered that he already knew more of the\nmodern subject than his tutors, and the further knowledge he sought was not to\nbe found there, maybe not anywhere in England. He began to acquire foreign\nbooks—especially books from Napoleon’s France, with which England was at war.\nFrom a specialty bookseller in London he got Lagrange’s _Théorie des fonctions\nanalytiques_ and “the great work of Lacroix, on the _Differential and Integral\nCalculus_.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1187170)\n\nHe was right: at Cambridge mathematics was stagnating. A century earlier\nNewton had been only the second professor of mathematics the university ever\nhad; all the subject’s power and prestige came from his legacy. Now his great\nshadow lay across English mathematics as a curse. The most advanced students\nlearned his brilliant and esoteric “fluxions” and the geometrical proofs of\nhis _Principia_. In the hands of anyone but Newton, the old methods of\ngeometry brought little but frustration. His peculiar formulations of the\ncalculus did his heirs little good. They were increasingly isolated. The\nEnglish professoriate “regarded any attempt at innovation as a sin against the\nmemory of Newton,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1187407) one nineteenth-\ncentury mathematician said. For the running river of modern mathematics a\nstudent had to look elsewhere, to the Continent, to “analysis” and the\nlanguage of differentiation as invented by Newton’s rival and nemesis,\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Fundamentally, there was only one calculus. Newton\nand Leibniz knew how similar their work was—enough that each accused the other\nof plagiarism. But they had devised incompatible systems of notation—different\nlanguages—and in practice these surface differences mattered more than the\nunderlying sameness. Symbols and operators were what a mathematician had to\nwork with, after all. Babbage, unlike most students, made himself fluent in\nboth—“the dots of Newton, the _d_ ’s of\nLeibnitz”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1187716)—and felt he had seen the\nlight. “It is always difficult to think and reason in a new\nlanguage.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1188044)\n\nIndeed, language itself struck him as a fit subject for philosophical study—a\nsubject into which he found himself sidetracked from time to time. Thinking\nabout language, while thinking _in_ language, leads to puzzles and paradoxes.\nBabbage tried for a while to invent, or construct, a universal language, a\nsymbol system that would be free of local idiosyncrasies and imperfections. He\nwas not the first to try. Leibniz himself had claimed to be on the verge of a\n_characteristica universalis_ that would give humanity “a new kind of an\ninstrument increasing the powers of reason far more than any optical\ninstrument has ever aided the power of\nvision.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1188237) As philosophers came face to\nface with the multiplicity of the world’s dialects, they so often saw language\nnot as a perfect vessel for truth but as a leaky sieve. Confusion about the\nmeanings of words led to contradictions. Ambiguities and false metaphors were\nsurely not inherent in the nature of things, but arose from a poor choice of\nsigns. If only one could find a proper mental technology, a true philosophical\nlanguage! Its symbols, properly chosen, must be universal, transparent, and\nimmutable, Babbage argued. Working systematically, he managed to create a\ngrammar and began to write down a lexicon but ran aground on a problem of\nstorage and retrieval—stopped “by the apparent impossibility of arranging\nsigns in any consecutive order, so as to find, as in a dictionary, the meaning\nof each when wanted.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1188774) Nevertheless he\nfelt that language was a thing a person could invent. Ideally, language should\nbe rationalized, made predictable and mechanical. The gears should mesh.\n\nStill an undergraduate, he aimed at a new revival of English mathematics—a\nsuitable cause for founding an advocacy group and launching a crusade. He\njoined with two other promising students, John Herschel and George Peacock, to\nform what they named the Analytical Society, “for the propagation of _d_ ’s”\nand against “the heresy of dots,” or as Babbage said, “the Dot-age of the\nUniversity.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1189038) (He was pleased with his\nown “wicked pun.”) In their campaign to free the calculus from English dotage,\nBabbage lamented “the cloud of dispute and national acrimony, which has been\nthrown over its origin.” Never mind if it seemed French. He declared, “We have\nnow to re-import the exotic, with nearly a century of foreign improvement, and\nto render it once more indigenous among\nus.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1189270) They were rebels against Newton in\nthe heart of Newton-land. They met over breakfast every Sunday after chapel.\n\n“Of course we were much ridiculed by the Dons,” Babbage recalled. “It was\ndarkly hinted that we were young infidels, and that no good would come of us.”\nYet their evangelism worked: the new methods spread from the bottom up,\nstudents learning faster than their teachers. “The brows of many a Cambridge\nmoderator were elevated, half in ire, half in admiration, at the unusual\nanswers which began to appear in examination\npapers,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1189674) wrote Herschel. The dots of\nNewton faded from the scene, his fluxions replaced by the notation and\nlanguage of Leibniz.\n\nMeanwhile Babbage never lacked companions with whom he could quaff wine or\nplay whist for six-penny points. With one set of friends he formed a Ghost\nClub, dedicated to collecting evidence for and against occult spirits. With\nanother set he founded a club called the Extractors, meant to sort out issues\nof sanity and insanity according to a set of procedures:\n\n  1. Every member shall communicate his address to the Secretary once in six months.\n  2. If this communication is delayed beyond twelve months, it shall be taken for granted that his relatives had shut him up as insane.\n  3. Every effort legal and illegal shall be made to get him out of the madhouse [hence the name “Extractors”].\n  4. Every candidate for admission as a member shall produce six certificates. Three that he is sane and three others that he is insane.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1189953)\n\nBut the Analytical Society was serious. It was with no irony, all earnestness,\nthat these mathematical friends, Babbage and Herschel and Peacock, resolved to\n“do their best to leave the world a wiser place than they found it.” They\nrented rooms and read papers to one another and published their\n“Transactions.” And in those rooms, as Babbage nodded over a book of\nlogarithms, one of them interrupted: “Well, Babbage, what are you dreaming\nabout?”\n\n“I am thinking that all these Tables might be calculated by\nmachinery,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1190211) he replied.\n\nAnyway that was how Babbage reported the conversation fifty years later. Every\ngood invention needs a eureka story, and he had another in reserve. He and\nHerschel were laboring together to produce a manuscript of logarithm tables\nfor the Cambridge Astronomical Society. These very logarithms had been\ncomputed before; logarithms must always be computed and recomputed and\ncompared and mistrusted. No wonder Babbage and Herschel, laboring over their\nown manuscript at Cambridge, found the work tedious. “I wish to God these\ncalculations had been executed by steam,” cried Babbage, and Herschel replied\nsimply, “It is quite possible.”\n\nSteam was the driver of all engines, the enabler of industry. If only for\nthese few decades, the word stood for power and force and all that was\nvigorous and modern. Formerly, water or wind drove the mills, and most of the\nworld’s work still depended on the brawn of people and horses and livestock.\nBut hot steam, generated by burning coal and brought under control by\ningenious inventors, had portability and versatility. It replaced muscles\neverywhere. It became a watchword: people on the go would now “steam up” or\n“get more steam on” or “blow off steam.” Benjamin Disraeli hailed “your moral\nsteam which can work the world.” Steam became the most powerful transmitter of\nenergy known to humanity.\n\nIt was odd even so that Babbage thought to exert this potent force in a\nweightless realm—applying steam to thought and arithmetic. Numbers were the\ngrist for his mill. Racks would slide, pinions would turn, and the mind’s work\nwould be done.\n\nIt should be done automatically, Babbage declared. What did it mean to call a\nmachine “automatic”? For him it was not just a matter of semantics but a\nprinciple for judging a machine’s usefulness. Calculating devices, such as\nthey were, could be divided into two classes: the first requiring human\nintervention, the second truly self-acting. To decide whether a machine\nqualified as automatic, he needed to ask a question that would have been\nsimpler if the words _input_ and _output_ had been invented: “Whether, when\nthe numbers on which it is to operate are placed in the instrument, it is\ncapable of arriving at its result by the mere motion of a spring, a descending\nweight, or any other constant force.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1190402)\nThis was a farsighted standard. It eliminated virtually all the devices ever\nused or conceived as tools for arithmetic—and there had been many, from the\nbeginning of recorded history. Pebbles in bags, knotted strings, and tally\nsticks of wood or bone served as short-term memory aids. Abacuses and slide\nrules applied more complex hardware to abstract reckoning. Then, in the\nseventeenth century, a few mathematicians conceived the first calculating\ndevices worthy of the name _machine_ , for adding and—through repetition of\nthe adding—multiplying. Blaise Pascal made an adding machine in 1642 with a\nrow of revolving disks, one for each decimal digit. Three decades later\nLeibniz improved on Pascal by using a cylindrical drum with protruding teeth\nto manage “carrying” from one digit to the\nnext.*[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1190583) Fundamentally, however, the\nprototypes of Pascal and Leibniz remained closer to the abacus—a passive\nregister of memory states—than to a kinetic machine. As Babbage saw, they were\nnot automatic.\n\nIt would not occur to him to use a device for a one-time calculation, no\nmatter how difficult. Machinery excelled at repetition—“intolerable labour and\nfatiguing monotony.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1191028) The demand for\ncomputation, he foresaw, would grow as the uses of commerce, industry, and\nscience came together. “I will yet venture to predict, that a time will\narrive, when the accumulating labour which arises from the arithmetical\napplication of mathematical formulae, acting as a constantly retarding force,\nshall ultimately impede the useful progress of the science, unless this or\nsome equivalent method is devised for relieving it from the overwhelming\nincumbrance of numerical detail.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1191429)\n\nIn the information-poor world, where any table of numbers was a rarity,\ncenturies went by before people began systematically to gather different\nprinted tables in order to check one against another. When they did, they\nfound unexpected flaws. For example, Taylor’s _Logarithms_ , the standard\nquarto printed in London in 1792, contained (it eventually transpired)\nnineteen errors of either one or two digits. These were itemized in the\n_Nautical Almanac_ , for, as the Admiralty knew well, every error was a\npotential shipwreck.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the nineteen corrections proved erroneous, so the next\nyear’s _Nautical Almanac_ printed an “erratum of the errata.” This in turn\nintroduced yet another error. “Confusion is worse\nconfounded,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1191766) declared _The Edinburgh\nReview_. The next almanac would have to put forth an “Erratum of the Erratum\nof the Errata in Taylor’s _Logarithms_.”\n\nParticular mistakes had their own private histories. When Ireland established\nits Ordnance Survey, to map the entire country on a finer scale than any\nnation had ever accomplished, the first order of business was to ensure that\nthe surveyors—teams of sappers and miners—had 250 sets of logarithmic tables,\nrelatively portable and accurate to seven\nplaces.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1192213) The survey office compared\nthirteen tables published in London over the preceding two hundred years, as\nwell as tables from Paris, Avignon, Berlin, Leipzig, Gouda, Florence, and\nChina. Six errors were discovered in almost every volume—and they were the\n_same_ six errors. The conclusion was inescapable: these tables had been\ncopied, one from another, at least in part.\n\nErrors arose from mistakes in carrying. Errors arose from the inversion of\ndigits, sometimes by the computers themselves and sometimes by the printer.\nPrinters were liable to transpose digits in successive lines of type. What a\nmysterious, fallible thing the human mind seemed to be! All these errors, one\ncommentator mused, “would afford a curious subject of metaphysical speculation\nrespecting the operation of the faculty of\nmemory.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1192534) Human computers had no future,\nhe saw: “It is only by the _mechanical fabrication of tables_ that such errors\ncan be rendered impossible.”\n\nBabbage proceeded by exposing mechanical principles within the numbers. He saw\nthat some of the structure could be revealed by computing differences between\none sequence and another. The “calculus of finite differences” had been\nexplored by mathematicians (especially the French) for a hundred years. Its\npower was to reduce high-level calculations to simple addition, ready to be\nroutinized. For Babbage the method was so crucial that he named his machine\nfrom its first conception the Difference Engine.\n\nBy way of example (for he felt the need to publicize and explain his\nconception many times as the years passed) Babbage offered the Table of\nTriangular Numbers. Like many of the sequences of concern, this was a ladder,\nstarting on the ground and rising ever higher:\n\n> > 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21 …\n\nHe illustrated the idea by imagining a child placing groups of marbles on the\nsand:\n\n![](images/00017.jpg)\n\nSuppose the child wants to know “how many marbles the thirtieth or any other\ndistant group might contain.” (It is a child after Babbage’s own heart.)\n“Perhaps he might go to papa to obtain this information; but I much fear papa\nwould snub him, and would tell him that it was nonsense—that it was\nuseless—that nobody knew the number, and so forth.” Understandably papa knows\nnothing of the Table of Triangular Numbers published at the Hague by É. de\nJoncourt, professor of philosophy. “If papa fail to inform him, let him go to\nmamma, who will not fail to find means to satisfy her darling’s\ncuriosity.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1192815) Meanwhile, Babbage answers\nthe question by means of a table of differences. The first column contains the\nnumber sequence in question. The next columns are derived by repeated\nsubtractions, until a constant is reached—a column made up entirely of a\nsingle number.\n\n![](images/00018.jpg)\n\nAny polynomial function can be reduced by the method of differences, and all\nwell-behaved functions, including logarithms, can be effectively approximated.\nEquations of higher degree require higher-order differences. Babbage offered\nanother concrete geometrical example that requires a table of third\ndifferences: piles of cannonballs in the form of a triangular pyramid—the\ntriangular numbers translated to three dimensions.\n\n![](images/00019.jpg)\n\nThe Difference Engine would run this process in reverse: instead of repeated\nsubtraction to find the differences, it would generate sequences of numbers by\na cascade of additions. To accomplish this, Babbage conceived a system of\nfigure wheels, marked with the numerals 0 to 9, placed along an axis to\nrepresent the decimal digits of a number: the units, the tens, the hundreds,\nand so on. The wheels would have gears. The gears along each axis would mesh\nwith the gears of the next, to add the successive digits. As the machinery\ntransmitted motion, wheel to wheel, it would be transmitting information, in\ntiny increments, the numbers summing across the axes. A mechanical\ncomplication arose, of course, when any sum passed 9. Then a unit had to be\ncarried to the next decimal place. To manage this, Babbage placed a projecting\ntooth on each wheel, between the 9 and 0. The tooth would push a lever, which\nwould in turn transmit its motion to the next wheel above.\n\nAt this point in the history of computing machinery, a new theme appears: the\nobsession with time. It occurred to Babbage that his machine had to compute\nfaster than the human mind and as fast as possible. He had an idea for\nparallel processing: number wheels arrayed along an axis could add a row of\nthe digits all at once. “If this could be accomplished,” he noted, “it would\nrender additions and subtractions with numbers having ten, twenty, fifty, or\nany number of figures, as rapid as those operations are with single\nfigures.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1193057) He could see a problem,\nhowever. The digits of a single addition could not be managed with complete\nindependence because of the carrying. The carries could overflow and cascade\nthrough a whole set of wheels. If the carries were known in advance, then the\nadditions could proceed in parallel. But that knowledge did not become\navailable in timely fashion. “Unfortunately,” he wrote, “there are multitudes\nof cases in which the carriages that become due are only known in successive\nperiods of time.” He counted up the time, assuming one second per operation:\nto add two fifty-digit numbers might take only nine seconds in itself, but the\ncarrying, in the worst case, could require fifty seconds more. Bad news\nindeed. “Multitudes of contrivances were designed, and almost endless drawings\nmade, for the purpose of economizing the time,” Babbage wrote ruefully. By\n1820 he had settled on a design. He acquired his own lathe, used it himself\nand hired metalworkers, and in 1822 managed to present the Royal Society with\na small working model, gleaming and futuristic.\n\n![](images/00020.jpg)\n\nBABBAGE’S WHEEL-WORK\n\nHe was living in London near the Regent’s Park as a sort of gentleman\nphilosopher, publishing mathematical papers and occasionally lecturing to the\npublic on astronomy. He married a wealthy young woman from Shropshire,\nGeorgiana Whitmore, the youngest of eight sisters. Beyond what money she had,\nhe was supported mainly by a £300 allowance from his father—whom he resented\nas a tyrannical, ungenerous, and above all close-minded old man. “It is\nscarcely too much to assert that he _believes_ nothing he _hears_ , and only\nhalf of what he sees,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1193252) Babbage wrote\nhis friend Herschel. When his father died, in 1827, Babbage inherited a\nfortune of £100,000. He briefly became an actuary for a new Protector Life\nAssurance Company and computed statistical tables rationalizing life\nexpectancies. He tried to get a university professorship, so far\nunsuccessfully, but he had an increasingly lively social life, and in\nscholarly circles people were beginning to know his name. With Herschel’s help\nhe was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nEven his misfires kindled his reputation. On behalf of _The Edinburgh Journal\nof Science_ Sir David Brewster sent him a classic in the annals of rejection\nletters: “It is with no inconsiderable degree of reluctance that I decline the\noffer of any Paper from you. I think, however, you will upon reconsideration\nof the subject be of opinion that I have no other alternative. The subjects\nyou propose for a series of Mathematical and Metaphysical Essays are so very\nprofound, that there is perhaps not a single subscriber to our Journal who\ncould follow them.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1193604) On behalf of his\nnascent invention, Babbage began a campaign of demonstrations and letters. By\n1823 the Treasury and the Exchequer had grown interested. He promised them\n“logarithmic tables as cheap as\npotatoes”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1193971)—how could they resist?\nLogarithms saved ships. The Lords of the Treasury authorized a first\nappropriation of £1,500.\n\nAs an abstract conception the Difference Engine generated excitement that did\nnot need to wait for anything so mundane as the machine’s actual construction.\nThe idea was landing in fertile soil. Dionysius Lardner, a popular lecturer on\ntechnical subjects, devoted a series of public talks to Babbage, hailing his\n“proposition to reduce arithmetic to the dominion of mechanism,—to substitute\nan automaton for a compositor,—to throw the powers of thought into wheel-\nwork.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1194250) The engine “must, when\ncompleted,” he said, “produce important effects, not only on the progress of\nscience, but on that of civilization.” It would be the _rational_ machine. It\nwould be a junction point for two roads—mechanism and thought. Its admirers\nsometimes struggled with their explanations of this intersection: “The\nquestion is set to the instrument,” Henry Colebrooke told the Astronomical\nSociety, “or the instrument is set to the\nquestion.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1194534) Either way, he said, “by\nsimply giving motion the solution is wrought.”\n\nBut the engine made slower progress in the realm of brass and wrought iron.\nBabbage tore out the stables in back of his London house and replaced them\nwith a forge, foundry, and fireproofed workshop. He engaged Joseph Clement, a\ndraftsman and inventor, self-educated, the son of a village weaver who had\nmade himself into England’s preeminent mechanical engineer. Babbage and\nClement realized that they would have to make new tools. Inside a colossal\niron frame the design called for the most intricate and precise parts—axles,\ngears, springs, and pins, and above all figure wheels by the hundreds and then\nthousands. Hand tools could never produce the components with the needed\nprecision. Before Babbage could have a manufactory of number tables, he would\nhave to build new manufactories of parts. The rest of the Industrial\nRevolution, too, needed standardization in its parts: interchangeable screws\nof uniform thread count and pitch; screws as fundamental units. The lathes of\nClement and his journeymen began to produce them.\n\n![](images/00021.jpg)\n\nA WOODCUT IMPRESSION (1853) OF A SMALL PORTION OF THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE\n[(Illustration credit 4.1)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1934220)\n\nAs the difficulties grew, so did Babbage’s ambitions. After ten years, the\nengine stood twenty-four inches high, with six vertical axles and dozens of\nwheels, capable of computing six-figure results. Ten years after that, the\nscale—on paper—had reached 160 cubic feet, 15 tons, and 25,000 parts, and the\npaper had spread, too, the drawings covering more than 400 square feet. The\nlevel of complexity was confounding. Babbage solved the problem of adding many\ndigits at once by separating the “adding motions” from the “carrying motions”\nand then staggering the timing of the carries. The addition would begin with a\nrush of grinding gears, first the odd-numbered columns of dials, then the even\ncolumns. Then the carries would recoil across the rows. To keep the motion\nsynchronized, parts of the machine would need to “know” at critical times that\na carry was pending. The information was conveyed by the state of a latch. For\nthe first time, but not the last, a device was invested with memory. “It is in\neffect a memorandum taken by the machine,” wrote his publicizer, Dionysius\nLardner. Babbage himself was self-conscious about anthropomorphizing but could\nnot resist. “The mechanical means I employed to make these carriages,” he\nsuggested, “bears some slight analogy to the operation of the faculty of\nmemory.”\n\nIn ordinary language, to describe even this basic process of addition required\na great effulgence of words, naming the metal parts, accounting for their\ninteractions, and sorting out interdependencies that multiplied to form a long\nchain of causality. Lardner’s own explanation of “carrying,” for example, was\nepic.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1194879) A single isolated instant of the\naction involved a dial, an index, a thumb, an axis, a trigger, a notch, a\nhook, a claw, a spring, a tooth, and a ratchet wheel:\n\n> > Now, at the moment that the division between 9 and 0 on the dial B2 passes\n> under the index, a thumb placed on the axis of this dial touches a trigger\n> which raises out of the notch of the hook which sustains the claw just\n> mentioned, and allows it to fall back by the recoil of the spring, and drop\n> into the next tooth of the ratchet wheel.\n\nHundreds of words later, summing up, Lardner resorted to a metaphor suggesting\nfluid dynamics:\n\n> > There are two systems of waves of mechanical action continually flowing\n> from the bottom to the top; and two streams of similar action constantly\n> passing from the right to the left. The crests of the first system of adding\n> waves fall upon the last difference, and upon every alternate one proceeding\n> upwards.… The first stream of carrying action passes from right to left\n> along the highest row and every alternate row.\n\nThis was one way of abstracting from the particular—the particulars being so\nintricate. And then he surrendered. “Its wonders, however, are still greater\nin its details,” he wrote. “We despair of doing it justice.”\n\nNor were ordinary draftsman’s plans sufficient for describing this machine\nthat was more than a machine. It was a dynamical system, its many parts each\ncapable of several modes or states, sometimes at rest and sometimes in motion,\npropagating their influence along convoluted channels. Could it ever be\nspecified completely, on paper? Babbage, for his own purposes, devised a new\nformal tool, a system of “mechanical notation” (his term). This was a language\nof signs meant to represent not just the physical form of a machine but its\nmore elusive properties: its timing and its logic. It was an extraordinary\nambition, as Babbage himself appreciated. In 1826 he proudly reported to the\nRoyal Society “On a Method of Expressing by Signs the Action of\nMachinery.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1195157) In part it was an exercise\nin classification. He analyzed the different ways in which something—motion,\nor power—could be “communicated” through a system. There were many ways. A\npart could receive its influence simply by being attached to another part, “as\na pin on a wheel, or a wheel and pinion on the same axis.” Or transmission\ncould occur “by stiff friction.” A part might be driven constantly by another\npart “as happens when a wheel is driven by a pinion”—or _not_ constantly, “as\nis the case when a stud lifts a bolt once in the course of a revolution.” Here\na vision of logical branching entered the scheme: the path of communication\nwould vary depending on the alternative states of some part of the machine.\nBabbage’s mechanical notation followed naturally from his work on symbolic\nnotation in mathematical analysis. Machinery, like mathematics, needed rigor\nand definition for progress. “The forms of ordinary language were far too\ndiffuse,” he wrote. “The signs, if they have been properly chosen, and if they\nshould be generally adopted, will form as it were an universal language.”\nLanguage was never a side issue for Babbage.\n\nHe finally won a university post, at Cambridge: the prestigious Lucasian\nProfessorship of Mathematics, formerly occupied by Newton. As in Newton’s\ntime, the work was not onerous. Babbage did not have to teach students,\ndeliver lectures, or even live in Cambridge, and this was just as well,\nbecause he was also becoming a popular fixture of London social life. At home\nat One Dorset Street he hosted a regular Saturday soirée that drew a\nglittering crowd—politicians, artists, dukes and duchesses, and the greatest\nEnglish scientists of the age: Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, and Charles\nLyell, among others.* They marveled at his calculating machine and, on display\nnearby, the dancing automaton of his youth. (In invitations he would write, “I\nhope you intend to patronise the ‘Silver Lady.’ She is to appear in new\ndresses and decorations.”) He was a mathematical raconteur—that was no\ncontradiction, in this time and place. Lyell reported approvingly that he\n“jokes and reasons in high mathematics.” He published a much-quoted treatise\napplying probability theory to the theological question of miracles. With\ntongue in cheek he wrote Alfred, Lord Tennyson, to suggest a correction for\nthe poet’s couplet: “Every minute dies a man, / Every minute one is born.”\n\n> > I need hardly point out to you that this calculation would tend to keep\n> the sum total of the world’s population in a state of perpetual equipoise,\n> whereas it is a well-known fact that the said sum total is constantly on the\n> increase. I would therefore take the liberty of suggesting that in the next\n> edition of your excellent poem the erroneous calculation to which I refer\n> should be corrected as follows: “Every moment dies a man / And one and a\n> sixteenth is born.” I may add that the exact figures are 1.167, but\n> something must, of course, be conceded to the laws of\n> metre.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1195528)\n\nFascinated with his own celebrity, he kept a scrapbook—“the pros and cons in\nparallel columns, from which he obtained a sort of\nbalance,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1195929) as one visitor described it.\n“I was told repeatedly that he spent all his days in gloating and grumbling\nover what people said of him.”\n\nBut progress on the engine, the main source of his fame, was faltering. In\n1832 he and his engineer Clement produced a working demonstration piece.\nBabbage displayed it at his parties to guests who found it miraculous or\nmerely puzzling. The Difference Engine stands—for a replica works today, in\nthe Science Museum in London—as a milestone of what could be achieved in\nprecision engineering. In the composition of its alloys, the exactness of its\ndimensions, the interchangeability of its parts, nothing surpassed this\nsegment of an unfinished machine. Still, it was a curio. And it was as far as\nBabbage could go.\n\nHe and his engineer fell into disputes. Clement demanded more and more money\nfrom Babbage and from the Treasury, which began to suspect profiteering. He\nwithheld parts and drawings and fought over control of the specialized machine\ntools in their workshops. The government, after more than a decade and\n£17,000, was losing faith in Babbage, and he in the government. In his dealing\nwith lords and ministers Babbage could be imperious. He was developing a sour\nview of the Englishman’s attitude toward technological innovation: “If you\nspeak to him of a machine for peeling a potato, he will pronounce it\nimpossible: if you peel a potato with it before his eyes, he will declare it\nuseless, because it will not slice a\npineapple.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1196217) They no longer saw the\npoint.\n\n![](images/00022.jpg)\n\nCHARLES BABBAGE (1860)\n\n“What shall we do to get rid of Mr. Babbage and his calculating machine?”\nPrime Minister Robert Peel wrote one of his advisers in August 1842. “Surely\nif completed it would be worthless as far as science is concerned.… It will be\nin my opinion a very costly toy.” He had no trouble finding voices inimical to\nBabbage in the civil service. Perhaps the most damning was George Biddell\nAiry, the Astronomer Royal, a starched and methodical figure, who with no\nequivocation told Peel precisely what he wanted to hear: that the engine was\nuseless. He added this personal note: “I think it likely he lives in a sort of\ndream as to its utility.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1196559) Peel’s\ngovernment terminated the project. As for Babbage’s dream, it continued. It\nhad already taken another turn. The engine in his mind had advanced into a new\ndimension. And he had met Ada Byron.\n\nIn the Strand, at the north end of the Lowther shopping arcade, visitors\nthronged to the National Gallery of Practical Science, “Blending Instruction\nwith Amusement,” a combination toy store and technology show set up by an\nAmerican entrepreneur. For the admission price of a shilling, a visitor could\ntouch the “electrical eel,” listen to lectures on the newest science, and\nwatch a model steamboat cruising a seventy-foot trough and the Perkins steam\ngun emitting a spray of bullets. For a guinea, she could sit for a\n“daguerreotype” or “photographic” portrait, by which a faithful and pleasing\nlikeness could be obtained in “less than One\nSecond.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1196770) Or she could watch, as young\nAugusta Ada Byron did, a weaver demonstrating the automated Jacquard loom, in\nwhich the patterns to be woven in cloth were encoded as holes punched into\npasteboard cards.\n\nAda was “the child of love,” her father had written, “—though born in\nbitterness, and nurtured in\nconvulsion.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1197132) Her father was a poet.\nWhen she was barely a month old, in 1816, the already notorious Lord Byron,\ntwenty-seven, and the bright, wealthy, and mathematically knowledgeable Anne\nIsabella Milbanke (Annabella), twenty-three, separated after a year of\nmarriage. Byron left England and never saw his daughter again. Her mother\nrefused to tell her who her father was until she was eight and he died in\nGreece, an international celebrity. The poet had begged for any news of his\ndaughter: “Is the Girl imaginative?—at _her_ present age I have an idea that I\nhad many feelings & notions which people would not believe if I stated them\n_now_.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1197413) Yes, she was imaginative.\n\nShe was a prodigy, clever at mathematics, encouraged by tutors, talented in\ndrawing and music, fantastically inventive and profoundly lonely. When she was\ntwelve, she set about inventing a means of flying. “I am going to begin my\npaper wings tomorrow,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1197747) she wrote to her\nmother. She hoped “to bring the art of flying to very great perfection. I\nthink of writing a book of _Flyology_ illustrated with plates.” For a while\nshe signed her letters “your very affectionate Carrier Pigeon.” She asked her\nmother to find a book illustrating bird anatomy, because she was reluctant “to\ndissect even a bird.” She analyzed her daily situation with a care for logic.\n\n> > Miss Stamp desires me to say that at present she is not particularly\n> pleased with me on account of some very foolish conduct yesterday about a\n> simple thing, and which she said was not only foolish but showed a spirit of\n> inattention, and though today she has not had reason to be dissatisfied with\n> me on the whole yet she says that she can not directly efface the\n> recollection of the past.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1198109)\n\nShe was growing up in a well-kept cloister of her mother’s arranging. She had\nyears of sickliness, a severe bout of measles, and episodes of what was called\nneurasthenia or hysteria. (“When I am weak,” she wrote, “I am always so\nexceedingly terrified, at _nobody knows what_ , that I can hardly help having\nan agitated look & manner.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1198326)) Green\ndrapery enclosed the portrait of her father that hung in one room. In her\nteens she developed a romantic interest in her tutor, which led to a certain\namount of sneaking about the house and gardens and to lovemaking as intimate\nas possible without, she said, actual “connection.” The tutor was dismissed.\nThen, in the spring, wearing white satin and tulle, the seventeen-year-old\nmade her ritual debut at court, where she met the king and queen, the most\nimportant dukes, and the French diplomat Talleyrand, whom she described as an\n“old monkey.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1198538)\n\nA month later she met Charles Babbage. With her mother, she went to see what\nLady Byron called his “thinking machine,” the portion of the Difference Engine\nin his salon. Babbage saw a sparkling, self-possessed young woman with\nporcelain features and a notorious name, who managed to reveal that she knew\nmore mathematics than most men graduating from university. She saw an imposing\nforty-one-year-old, authoritative eyebrows anchoring his strong-boned face,\nwho possessed wit and charm and did not wear these qualities lightly. He\nseemed a kind of visionary—just what she was seeking. She admired the machine,\ntoo. An onlooker reported: “While other visitors gazed at the working of this\nbeautiful instrument with the sort of expression, and I dare say the sort of\nfeeling, that some savages are said to have shown on first seeing a looking-\nglass or hearing a gun, Miss Byron, young as she was, understood its working,\nand saw the great beauty of the\ninvention.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1198707) Her feeling for the beauty\nand abstractions of mathematics, fed only in morsels from her succession of\ntutors, was overflowing. It had no outlet. A woman could not attend university\nin England, nor join a scientific society (with two exceptions: the botanical\nand horticultural).\n\n![](images/00023.jpg)\n\nAUGUSTA ADA BYRON KING, COUNTESS OF LOVELACE, AS PAINTED IN 1836 BY MARGARET\nCARPENTER. “I CONCLUDE SHE IS BENT ON DISPLAYING THE WHOLE EXPANSE OF MY\nCAPACIOUS JAW BONE, UPON WHICH I THINK THE WORD MATHEMATICS SHOULD BE\nWRITTEN.”\n\nAda became a tutor for the young daughters of one of her mother’s friends.\nWhen writing to them, she signed herself, “your affectionate & untenable\nInstructress.” On her own she studied Euclid. Forms burgeoned in her mind. “I\ndo not consider that I know a proposition,” she wrote another tutor, “until I\ncan imagine to myself a figure in the air, and go through the construction &\ndemonstration without any book or assistance\nwhatever.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1198981) She could not forget\nBabbage, either, or his “gem of all\nmechanism.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1199267) To another friend she\nreported her “great anxiety about the machine.” Her gaze turned inward, often.\nShe liked to think about herself thinking.\n\nBabbage himself had moved far beyond the machine on display in his drawing\nroom; he was planning a new machine, still an engine of computation but\ntransmuted into another species. He called this the Analytical Engine.\nMotivating him was a quiet awareness of the Difference Engine’s limitations:\nit could not, merely by adding differences, compute every sort of number or\nsolve any mathematical problem. Inspiring him, as well, was the loom on\ndisplay in the Strand, invented by Joseph-Marie Jacquard, controlled by\ninstructions encoded and stored as holes punched in cards.\n\nWhat caught Babbage’s fancy was not the weaving, but rather the encoding, from\none medium to another, of patterns. The patterns would appear in damask,\neventually, but first were “sent to a peculiar artist.” This specialist, as he\nsaid,\n\n> > punches holes in a set of pasteboard cards in such a manner that when\n> those cards are placed in a Jacquard loom, it will then weave upon its\n> produce the exact pattern designed by the\n> artist.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1199480)\n\nThe notion of abstracting information away from its physical substrate\nrequired careful emphasis. Babbage explained, for example, that the weaver\nmight choose different threads and different colors—“but in all these cases\nthe _form_ of the pattern will be precisely the same.” As Babbage conceived\nhis machine now, it raised this very process of abstraction to higher and\nhigher degrees. He meant the cogs and wheels to handle not just numbers but\nvariables standing in for numbers. Variables were to be filled or determined\nby the outcomes of prior calculations, and, further, the very operations—such\nas addition or multiplication—were to be changeable, depending on prior\noutcomes. He imagined these abstract information quantities being stored in\ncards: variable cards and operation cards. He thought of the machine as\nembodying laws and of the cards as communicating these laws. Lacking a ready-\nmade vocabulary, he found it awkward to express his fundamental working\nconcepts; for example,\n\n> > how the machine could perform the act of judgment sometimes required\n> during an analytical inquiry, when two or more different courses presented\n> themselves, especially as the proper course to be adopted could not be known\n> in many cases until all the previous portion had been gone\n> through.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1199770)\n\nHe made clear, though, that information—representations of number and\nprocess—would course through the machinery. It would pass to and from certain\nspecial physical locations, which Babbage named a _store_ , for storage, and a\n_mill_ , for action.\n\nIn all this he had an intellectual companion now in Ada, first his acolyte and\nthen his muse. She married a sensible and promising aristocrat, William King,\nher senior by a decade and a favorite of her mother. In the space of a few\nyears he was elevated to the peerage as earl of Lovelace—making Ada,\ntherefore, a countess—and, still in her early twenties, she bore three\nchildren. She managed their homes, in Surrey and London, practiced the harp\nfor hours daily (“I am at present a condemned slave to _my harp_ , no easy\nTask master”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1199975)), danced at balls, met the\nnew queen, Victoria, and sat for her portrait, self-consciously (“I conclude\n[the artist] is bent on displaying the whole expanse of my capacious jaw bone,\nupon which I think the word Mathematics should be written”). She suffered\nterrible dark moods and bouts of illness, including cholera. Her interests and\nbehavior still set her apart. One morning she went alone in her carriage,\ndressed plainly, to see a model of Edward Davy’s “electrical telegraph” at\nExeter Hall\n\n> > & the only other person was a middle-aged gentleman who chose to behave as\n> if _I_ were the show [she wrote to her mother] which of course I thought was\n> the most impudent and unpardonable.—I am sure he took me for a very young (&\n> I suppose he thought rather handsome) governess.… He stopped as long as I\n> did, & then followed me out.—I took care to look as aristocratic & _as like\n> a Countess_ as possible.… I must try & add a little age to my appearance.… I\n> would go & see something everyday & I am sure London would never be\n> exhausted.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1200263)\n\nLady Lovelace adored her husband but reserved much of her mental life for\nBabbage. She had dreams, waking dreams, of something she could not be and\nsomething she could not achieve, except by proxy, through his genius. “I have\na peculiar _way_ of _learning_ ,” she wrote to him, “& I think it must be a\npeculiar man to teach me successfully.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1200501)\nHer growing desperation went side by side with a powerful confidence in her\nuntried abilities. “I hope you are bearing me in mind,” she wrote some months\nlater, “I mean my mathematical interests. You know this is the greatest favour\nany one can do me.—Perhaps, none of us can estimate _how_ great.…”\n\n> > You know I am by nature a bit of a philosopher, & a very great\n> speculator,—so that I look on through a very immeasurable vista, and though\n> I see nothing but vague & cloudy uncertainty in the foreground of our being,\n> yet I fancy I discern a very bright light a good way further on, and this\n> makes me care much less about the cloudiness & indistinctness which is\n> near.—Am I too imaginative for you? I think\n> not.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1200844)\n\nThe mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan, a friend of Babbage and of\nLady Byron, became Ada’s teacher by post. He sent her exercises. She sent him\nquestions and musings and doubts (“I could wish I went on quicker”; “I am\nsorry to say I am sadly obstinate about the Term at which Convergence begins”;\n“I have enclosed my Demonstration of _my_ view of the case”; “functional\nEquations are complete Will-o-the-wisps to me”; “However I try to keep my\nmetaphysical head in order”). Despite her naïveté, or because of it, he\nrecognized a “power of thinking … so utterly out of the common way for any\nbeginner, man or woman.” She had rapidly mastered trigonometry and integral\nand differential calculus, and he told her mother privately that if he had\nencountered “such power” in a Cambridge student he would have anticipated “an\noriginal mathematical investigator, perhaps of first rate\neminence.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1201080) She was fearless about\ndrilling down to first principles. Where she felt difficulties, real\ndifficulties lay.\n\n![](images/00024.jpg)\n\nOne winter she grew obsessed with a fashionable puzzle known as Solitaire, the\nRubik’s Cube of its day. Thirty-two pegs were arranged on a board with thirty-\nthree holes, and the rules were simple: Any peg may jump over another\nimmediately adjacent, and the peg jumped over is removed, until no more jumps\nare possible. The object is to finish with only one peg remaining. “People may\ntry thousands of times, and not succeed in this,” she wrote Babbage excitedly.\n\n> > I _have_ done it by trying & observation & can now do it at any time, but\n> I want to know if the problem admits of being put into a mathematical\n> Formula, & solved in this manner.… There must be a definite principle, a\n> compound I imagine of numerical & geometrical properties, on which the\n> solution depends, & which can be put into symbolic\n> language.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1201471)\n\nA formal solution to a game—the very idea of such a thing was original. The\ndesire to create a language of symbols, in which the solution could be\nencoded—this way of thinking was Babbage’s, as she well knew.\n\nShe pondered her growing powers of mind. They were not strictly mathematical,\nas she saw it. She saw mathematics as merely a part of a greater imaginative\nworld. Mathematical transformations reminded her “of certain sprites & fairies\none reads of, who are at one’s elbows in _one_ shape now, & the next minute in\na form most dissimilar; and uncommonly deceptive, troublesome & tantalizing\nare the mathematical sprites & fairies sometimes; like the types I have found\nfor them in the world of Fiction.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1201825)\n_Imagination_ —the cherished quality. She mused on it; it was her heritage\nfrom her never-present father.\n\n> > We talk _much_ of Imagination. We talk of the Imagination of Poets, the\n> Imagination of Artists &c; I am inclined to think that in general we don’t\n> know very exactly _what_ we are talking about.…\n>\n\n>> It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of\nScience. It is that which feels & discovers what _is_ , the _real_ which we\nsee not, which _exists_ not for our _senses_. Those who have learned to walk\non the threshold of the unknown worlds … may then with the fair white wings of\nImagination hope to soar further into the unexplored amidst which we\nlive.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1202058)\n\nShe began to believe she had a divine mission to fulfill. She used that word,\n_mission_. “I have on my mind most strongly the impression that Heaven has\nallotted me some peculiar _intellectual-moral_ mission to\nperform.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1202352) She had powers. She confided\nin her mother:\n\n> > I believe myself to possess a most singular combination of qualities\n> exactly fitted to make me _pre-eminently_ a discoverer of the _hidden\n> realities_ of nature.… The belief has been _forced_ upon me, & most slow\n> have I been to admit it even.\n\nShe listed her qualities:\n\n> > Firstly: Owing to some peculiarity in my nervous system, I have\n> _perceptions_ of some things, which no one else has; or at least very few,\n> if any.… Some might say an _intuitive_ perception of hidden things;—that is\n> of things hidden from eyes, ears & the ordinary senses.…\n>\n\n>> Secondly;—my immense reasoning faculties;\n\n>\n\n>> Thirdly;… the power not only of throwing my whole energy & existence into\nwhatever I choose, but also bring to bear on any one subject or idea, a vast\napparatus from all sorts of apparently irrelevant & extraneous sources. I can\nthrow _rays_ from every quarter of the universe into _one_ vast focus.\n\nShe admitted that this sounded mad but insisted she was being logical and\ncool. She knew her life’s course now, she told her mother. “ _What_ a mountain\nI have to climb! It is enough to frighten anyone who had not all that most\ninsatiable & restless energy, which from my babyhood has been the plague of\nyour life & my own. However it has found food I believe at\nlast.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1202579) She had found it in the\nAnalytical Engine.\n\nBabbage meanwhile, restless and omnivorous, was diverting his energies to\nanother burgeoning technology, steam’s most powerful expression, the railroad.\nThe newly formed Great Western Railway was laying down track and preparing\ntrial runs of locomotive engines from Bristol to London under the supervision\nof Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the brilliant engineer, then just twenty-seven\nyears old. Brunel asked Babbage for help, and Babbage decided to begin with an\ninformation-gathering program—characteristically ingenious and grandiose. He\noutfitted an entire railway carriage. On a specially built, independently\nsuspended table, rollers unwound sheets of paper a thousand feet long, while\npens drew lines to “express” (as Babbage put it) measurements of the\nvibrations and forces felt by the carriage in every direction. A chronometer\nmarked the passage of time in half seconds. He covered two miles of paper this\nway.\n\nAs he traversed the rails, he realized that a peculiar danger of steam\nlocomotion lay in its outracing every previous means of communication. Trains\nlost track of one another. Until the most regular and disciplined scheduling\nwas imposed, hazard ran with every movement. One Sunday Babbage and Brunel,\noperating in different engines, barely avoided smashing into each other. Other\npeople, too, worried about this new gap between the speeds of travel and\nmessaging. An important London banker told Babbage he disapproved: “It will\nenable our clerks to plunder us, and then be off to Liverpool on their way to\nAmerica at the rate of twenty miles an\nhour.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1202847) Babbage could only express the\nhope that science might yet find a remedy for the problem it had created.\n(“Possibly we might send lightning to outstrip the culprit.”)\n\nAs for his own engine—the one that would travel nowhere—he had found a fine\nnew metaphor. It would be, he said, “a locomotive that lays down its own\nrailway.”\n\nBitter as he was about England’s waning interest in his visionary plans,\nBabbage found admirers on the continent, particular in Italy—“the country of\nArchimedes and Galileo,” as he put it to his new friends. In the summer of\n1840 he gathered up his sheaves of drawings and journeyed by way of Paris and\nLyon, where he watched the great Jacquard loom at Manufacture d’Étoffes pour\nAmeublements et Ornements d’Église, to Turin, the capital of Sardinia, for an\nassembly of mathematicians and engineers. There he made his first (and last)\npublic presentation of the Analytical Engine. “The discovery of the Analytical\nEngine is so much in advance of my own country, and I fear even of the\nage,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1203189) he said. He met the Sardinian\nking, Charles Albert, and, more significantly, an ambitious young\nmathematician named Luigi Menabrea. Later Menabrea was to become a general, a\ndiplomat, and the prime minister of Italy; now he prepared a scientific\nreport, “ _Notions sur la machine analytique_\n,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1203428) to introduce Babbage’s plan to a\nbroader community of European philosophers.\n\nAs soon as this reached Ada Lovelace, she began translating it into English,\ncorrecting errors on the basis of her own knowledge. She did that on her own,\nwithout telling either Menabrea or Babbage.\n\nWhen she finally did show Babbage her draft, in 1843, he responded\nenthusiastically, urging her to write on her own behalf, and their\nextraordinary collaboration began in earnest. They sent letters by messenger\nback and forth across London at a ferocious pace—“My Dear Babbage” and “My\nDear Lady Lovelace”—and met whenever they could at her home in St. James’s\nSquare. The pace was almost frantic. Though he was the eminence, fifty-one\nyears old to her twenty-seven, she took charge, mixing stern command with\nbanter. “I want you to answer me the following question by return of post”;\n“Be kind enough to write this out properly for me”; “You were a little harum-\nscarum and inaccurate”; “I wish you were as accurate and as much to be relied\non as myself.” She proposed to sign her work with her initials—nothing so\nforward as her name—not to “ _proclaim_ who has written it,” merely to “\n_individualize_ and _identify_ it with other productions of the said\nA.A.L.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1203693)\n\nHer exposition took the form of notes lettered A through G, extending to\nnearly three times the length of Menabrea’s essay. They offered a vision of\nthe future more general and more prescient than any expressed by Babbage\nhimself. How general? The engine did not just calculate; it performed\n_operations_ , she said, defining an operation as “any process which alters\nthe mutual relation of two or more things,” and declaring: “This is the most\ngeneral definition, and would include all subjects in the\nuniverse.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1204053) The science of operations,\nas she conceived it,\n\n> > is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value; just as\n> logic has its own peculiar truth and value, independently of the subjects to\n> which we may apply its reasonings and processes.… One main reason why the\n> separate nature of the science of operations has been little felt, and in\n> general little dwelt on, is the _shifting_ meaning of many of the symbols\n> used.\n\n_Symbols_ and _meaning:_ she was emphatically not speaking of mathematics\nalone. The engine “might act upon other things besides _number_.” Babbage had\ninscribed numerals on those thousands of dials, but their working could\nrepresent symbols more abstractly. The engine might process any meaningful\nrelationships. It might manipulate language. It might create music.\n“Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in\nthe science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such\nexpression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific\npieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.”\n\nIt had been an engine of numbers; now it became an engine of information.\nA.A.L. perceived that more distinctly and more imaginatively than Babbage\nhimself. She explained his prospective, notional, virtual creation as though\nit already existed:\n\n> > The Analytical Engine does not occupy common ground with mere “calculating\n> machines.” It holds a position wholly its own.… A new, a vast, and a\n> powerful language is developed … in which to wield its truths so that these\n> may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the\n> purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered\n> possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but the theoretical and\n> the practical in the mathematical world, are brought into more intimate and\n> effective connexion with each other.\n\n> > … We may say most aptly, that the Analytical Engine _weaves algebraical\n> patterns_ just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and\n> leaves.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1204441)\n\nFor this flight of fancy she took full responsibility. “Whether the inventor\nof this engine had any such views in his mind while working out the invention,\nor whether he may subsequently ever have regarded it under this phase, we do\nnot know; but it is one that forcibly occurred to ourselves.”\n\nShe proceeded from the poetic to the practical. She set forth on a virtuoso\nexcursion through a hypothetical program by which this hypothetical machine\nmight compute a famously deep-seated infinite series, the Bernoulli numbers.\nThese numbers arise in the summing of numbers from 1 to _n_ raised to integral\npowers, and they occur in various guises all through number theory. No direct\nformula generates them, but they can be worked out methodically, by expanding\ncertain formulas further and further and looking at the coefficients each\ntime. She began with examples; the simplest, she wrote, would be the expansion\nof\n\n![](images/00025.jpg)\n\nand another approach would be via\n\n![](images/00026.jpg)\n\nbut she would take a more challenging path, because “our object is not\nsimplicity … but the illustration of the powers of the engine.”\n\nShe devised a process, a set of rules, a sequence of operations. In another\ncentury this would be called an algorithm, later a computer program, but for\nnow the concept demanded painstaking explanation. The trickiest point was that\nher algorithm was recursive. It ran in a loop. The result of one iteration\nbecame food for the next. Babbage had alluded to this approach as “the Engine\neating its own tail.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1204649) A.A.L. explained:\n“We easily perceive that since every successive function is arranged in a\nseries following the same law, there would be a cycle of a cycle of a cycle,\n&c.… The question is so exceedingly complicated, that perhaps few persons can\nbe expected to follow.… Still it is a very important case as regards the\nengine, and suggests ideas peculiar to itself, which we should regret to pass\nwholly without allusion.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1204976)\n\nA core idea was the entity she and Babbage called the _variable_. Variables\nwere, in hardware terms, the machine’s columns of number dials. But there were\n“Variable cards,” too. In software terms they were a sort of receptacle or\nenvelope, capable of representing, or storing, a number of many decimal\ndigits. (“What is there in a name?” Babbage wrote. “It is merely an empty\nbasket until you put something in it.”) Variables were the machine’s units of\ninformation. This was quite distinct from the algebraic variable. As A.A.L.\nexplained, “The origin of this appellation is, that the values on the columns\nare destined to change, that is to vary, in every conceivable manner.” Numbers\n_traveled_ , in effect, from variable cards to variables, from variables to\nthe mill (for operations), from the mill to the store. To solve the problem of\ngenerating Bernoulli numbers, she choreographed an intricate dance. She worked\ndays and sometimes through the night, messaging Babbage across London,\nstruggling with sickness and ominous pains, her mind soaring:\n\n> > That _brain_ of mine is something more than merely _mortal;_ as time will\n> show; (if only my _breathing_ & some other et-ceteras do not make too rapid\n> a progress _towards_ instead of _from_ mortality).\n>\n\n>> Before ten years are over, the Devil’s in it if I have not sucked out some\nof the life-blood from the mysteries of this universe, in a way that no purely\nmortal lips or brains could do.\n\n>\n\n>> No one knows what almost _awful_ energy & power lie yet undevelopped in\nthat _wiry_ little system of mine. I say _awful_ , because you may imagine\nwhat it _might_ be under certain circumstances.…\n\n>\n\n>> I am doggedly attacking & sifting to the very bottom, all the ways of\ndeducing the Bernoulli Numbers.… I am grappling with this subject, &\n_connecting_ it with others.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1205313)\n\nShe was programming the machine. She programmed it in her mind, because the\nmachine did not exist. The complexities she encountered for the first time\nbecame familiar to programmers of the next century:\n\n> > How multifarious and how mutually complicated are the considerations which\n> the working of such an engine involve. There are frequently several distinct\n> sets of effects going on simultaneously; all in a manner independent of each\n> other, and yet to a greater or less degree exercising a mutual influence. To\n> adjust each to every other, and indeed even to perceive and trace them out\n> with perfect correctness and success, entails difficulties whose nature\n> partakes to a certain extent of those involved in every question where\n> conditions are very numerous and inter-\n> complicated.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1205657)\n\nShe reported her feelings to Babbage: “I am in much dismay at having got into\nso amazing a quagmire & botheration.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1205984)\nAnd nine days later: “I find that my plans & ideas keep gaining in clearness,\n& assuming more of the _crystalline_ & less & less of the _nebulous_\nform.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1206251) She knew she had achieved\nsomething utterly new. Ten days later still, struggling over the final proofs\nwith “Mr Taylors Printing Office” in Fleet Street, she declared: “I do not\nthink you possess half _my_ forethought, & power of foreseeing all _possible_\ncontingencies (_probable_ & _improbable_ , just alike).—… I do _not_ believe\nthat my father was (or ever could have been) such a _Poet_ as _I shall_ be an\n_Analyst;_ (& Metaphysician); for with me the two go together\nindissolubly.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1206471)\n\nWho would have used this machine? Not clerks or shopkeepers, said Babbage’s\nson, many years later. Common arithmetic was never the purpose—“It would be\nlike using the steam hammer to crush the\nnut.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1206783) He paraphrased Leibniz: “It is\nnot made for those who sell vegetables or little fishes, but for\nobservatories, or the private rooms of calculators, or for others who can\neasily bear the expense, and need a good deal of calculation.” Babbage’s\nengine had not been well understood, not by his government and not by the many\nfriends who passed through his salon, but in its time its influence traveled\nfar.\n\nIn America, a country bursting with invention and scientific optimism, Edgar\nAllan Poe wrote, “What shall we think of the calculating machine of Mr.\nBabbage? What shall we think of an engine of wood and metal which can … render\nthe exactitude of its operations mathematically certain through its power of\ncorrecting its possible errors?”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1207026) Ralph\nWaldo Emerson had met Babbage in London and declared in 1870, “Steam is an apt\nscholar and a strong-shouldered fellow, but it has not yet done all its\nwork.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1207376)\n\n> > It already walks about the field like a man, and will do anything required\n> of it. It irrigates crops, and drags away a mountain. It must sew our\n> shirts, it must drive our gigs; taught by Mr. Babbage, it must calculate\n> interest and logarithms.… It is yet coming to render many higher services of\n> a mechanico-intellectual kind.\n\nIts wonders met disapproval, too. Some critics feared a rivalry between\nmechanism and mind. “What a satire is that machine on the mere\nmathematician!”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1207632) said Oliver Wendell\nHolmes Sr. “A Frankenstein-monster, a thing without brains and without heart,\ntoo stupid to make a blunder; which turns out results like a corn-sheller, and\nnever grows any wiser or better, though it grind a thousand bushels of them!”\nThey all spoke as though the engine were real, but it never was. It remained\npoised before its own future.\n\nMidway between his time and ours, the _Dictionary of National Biography_\ngranted Charles Babbage a brief entry—almost entirely devoid of relevance or\nconsequence:\n\n> > mathematician and scientific mechanician;… obtained government grant for\n> making a calculating machine … but the work of construction ceased, owning\n> to disagreements with the engineer; offered the government an improved\n> design, which was refused on grounds of expense;… Lucasian professor of\n> mathematics, Cambridge, but delivered no lectures.\n\nBabbage’s interests, straying so far from mathematics, seeming so\nmiscellaneous, did possess a common thread that neither he nor his\ncontemporaries could perceive. His obsessions belonged to no category—that is,\nno category yet existing. His true subject was information: messaging,\nencoding, processing.\n\nHe took up two quirky and apparently unphilosophical challenges, which he\nhimself noted had a deep connection one to the other: picking locks and\ndeciphering codes. Deciphering, he said, was “one of the most fascinating of\narts, and I fear I have wasted upon it more time than it\ndeserves.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1207914) To rationalize the process,\nhe set out to perform a “complete analysis” of the English language. He\ncreated sets of special dictionaries: lists of the words of one letter, two\nletters, three letters, and so on; and lists of words alphabetized by their\ninitial letter, second letter, third letter, and so on. With these at hand he\ndesigned methodologies for solving anagram puzzles and word squares.\n\nIn tree rings he saw nature encoding messages about the past. A profound\nlesson: that a tree records a whole complex of information in its solid\nsubstance. “Every shower that falls, every change of temperature that occurs,\nand every wind that blows, leaves on the vegetable world the traces of its\npassage; slight, indeed, and imperceptible, perhaps, to us, but not the less\npermanently recorded in the depths of those woody\nfabrics.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1208166)\n\nIn London workshops he had observed speaking tubes, made of tin, “by which the\ndirections of the superintendent are instantly conveyed to the remotest\nparts.” He classified this technology as a contribution to the “economy of\ntime” and suggested that no one had yet discovered a limit on the distance\nover which spoken messages might travel. He made a quick calculation:\n“Admitting it to be possible between London and Liverpool, about seventeen\nminutes would elapse before the words spoken at one end would reach the other\nextremity of the pipe.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1208591) In the 1820s he\nhad an idea for transmitting written messages, “enclosed in small cylinders\nalong wires suspended from posts, and from towers, or from church\nsteeples,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1208851) and he built a working model\nin his London house. He grew obsessed with other variations on the theme of\nsending messages over the greatest possible distances. The post bag dispatched\nnightly from Bristol, he noted, weighed less than one hundred pounds. To send\nthese messages 120 miles, “a coach and apparatus, weighing above thirty\nhundred weight, are put in motion, and also conveyed over the same\nspace.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1209107) What a waste! Suppose, instead,\nhe suggested, post towns were linked by a series of high pillars erected every\nhundred feet or so. Steel wires would stretch from pillar to pillar. Within\ncities, church steeples might serve as the pillars. Tin cases with wheels\nwould roll along the wires and carry batches of letters. The expense would be\n“comparatively trifling,” he said, “nor is it impossible that the stretched\nwire might itself be available for a species of telegraphic communication yet\nmore rapid.”\n\nDuring the Great Exhibition of 1851, when England showcased its industrial\nachievement in a Crystal Palace, Babbage placed an oil lamp with a moveable\nshutter in an upstairs window at Dorset Street to create an “occulting light”\napparatus that blinked coded signals to passersby. He drew up a standardized\nsystem for lighthouses to use in sending numerical signals and posted twelve\ncopies to, as he said, “the proper authorities of the great maritime\ncountries.” In the United States, the Congress approved $5,000 for a trial\nprogram of Babbage’s system. He studied sun signals and “zenith-light signals”\nflashed by mirrors, and Greenwich time signals for transmission to\nmariners.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1209334) For communicating between\nstranded ships and rescuers on shore, he proposed that all nations adopt a\nstandard list of a hundred questions and answers, assigned numbers, “to be\nprinted on cards, and nailed up on several parts of every vessel.” Similar\nsignals, he suggested, could help the military, the police, the railways, or\neven, “for various social purposes,” neighbors in the country.\n\nThese purposes were far from obvious. “For what purposes will the electric\ntelegraph become useful?” the king of Sardinia, Charles Albert, asked Babbage\nin 1840. Babbage searched his mind for an illustration, “and at last I pointed\nout the probability that, by means of the electric telegraphs, his Majesty’s\nfleet might receive warning of coming storms.…”\n\n> > This led to a new theory of storms, about which the king was very curious.\n> By degrees I endeavoured to make it clear. I cited, as an illustration, a\n> storm which had occurred but a short time before I left England. The damage\n> done by it at Liverpool was very great, and at Glasgow immense.… I added\n> that if there had been electric communication between Genoa and a few other\n> places the people of Glasgow might have had information of one of those\n> storms twenty-four hours previously to its\n> arrival.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1209572)\n\nAs for the engine, it had to be forgotten before it was remembered. It had no\nobvious progeny. It rematerialized like buried treasure and inspired a sense\nof puzzled wonder. With the computer era in full swing, the historian Jenny\nUglow felt in Babbage’s engines “a different sense of\nanachronism.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1209764) Such failed inventions,\nshe wrote, contain “ideas that lie like yellowing blueprints in dark\ncupboards, to be stumbled on afresh by later generations.”\n\nMeant first to generate number tables, the engine in its modern form instead\nrendered number tables obsolete. Did Babbage anticipate that? He did wonder\nhow the future would make use of his vision. He guessed that a half century\nwould pass before anyone would try again to create a general-purpose computing\nmachine. In fact, it took most of a century for the necessary substrate of\ntechnology to be laid down. “If, unwarned by my example,” he wrote in 1864,\n“any man shall undertake and shall succeed in really constructing an engine\nembodying in itself the whole of the executive department of mathematical\nanalysis upon different principles or by simpler mechanical means, I have no\nfear of leaving my reputation in his charge, for he alone will be fully able\nto appreciate the nature of my efforts and the value of their\nresults.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1210052)\n\nAs he looked to the future, he saw a special role for one truth above all:\n“the maxim, that knowledge is power.” He understood that literally. Knowledge\n“is itself the generator of physical force,” he declared. Science gave the\nworld steam, and soon, he suspected, would turn to the less tangible power of\nelectricity: “Already it has nearly chained the ethereal fluid.” And he looked\nfurther:\n\n> > It is the science of _calculation_ —which becomes continually more\n> necessary at each step of our progress, and which must ultimately govern the\n> whole of the applications of science to the arts of life.\n\nSome years before his death, he told a friend that he would gladly give up\nwhatever time he had left, if only he could be allowed to live for three days,\nfive centuries in the future.\n\nAs for his young friend Ada, countess of Lovelace, she died many years before\nhim—a protracted, torturous death from cancer of the womb, her agony barely\nlessened by laudanum and cannabis. For a long time her family kept from her\nthe truth of her illness. In the end she knew she was dying. “They say that ‘\n_coming events cast their shadows before_ ,’\n”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1210296) she wrote to her mother. “May they\nnot sometimes cast their _lights_ before?” They buried her next to her father.\n\nShe, too, had a last dream of the future: “my being _in time_ an _Autocrat_ ,\nin my own way.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1210610) She would have\nregiments, marshaled before her. The iron rulers of the earth would have to\ngive way. And of what would her regiments consist? “I do not at present\ndivulge. I have however the hope that they will be most _harmoniously_\ndisciplined troops;—consisting of vast _numbers_ , & marching in irresistible\npower to the sound of _Music_. Is not this very mysterious? Certainly _my_\ntroops must consist of _numbers_ , or they can have no existence at all.… But\nthen, _what_ are these _Numbers_? There is a riddle—”\n\n* * *\n\n* Leibniz dreamed grandly of mechanizing algebra and even reason itself. “We may give final praise to the machine,” he wrote. “It will be desirable to all who are engaged in computations … the managers of financial affairs, the administrators of others’ estates, merchants, surveyors, geographers, navigators, astronomers.… For it is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of calculation.”\n\n* Another guest, Charles Dickens, put something of Babbage into the character of Daniel Doyce in Little Dorrit. Doyce is an inventor mistreated by the government he tries to serve: “He is well known as a very ingenious man.… He perfects an invention (involving a very curious secret process) of great importance to his country and his fellow-creatures. I won’t say how much money it cost him, or how many years of his life he had been about it, but he brought it to perfection.” Dickens added: “A composed and unobtrusive self-sustainment was noticeable in Daniel Doyce—a calm knowledge that what was true must remain true.”\n\n\n# 5 | A NERVOUS SYSTEM FOR THE EARTH\n\n\n##\n\n> (What Can One Expect of a Few Wretched Wires?)\n\n> _Is it a fact—or have I dreamt it—that, by means of electricity, the world\n> of matter has become a great nerve, vibrating thousands of miles in a\n> breathless point of time?

Or, shall we say, it is itself a thought,\n> nothing but thought, and no longer the substance which we deemed it!_\n\n> —Nathaniel Hawthorne (1851)[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1211072)\n\nTHREE CLERKS IN A SMALL ROOM UPSTAIRS in the Ferry House of Jersey City\nhandled the entire telegraph traffic of the city of New York in 1846 and did\nnot have to work very hard.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1211366) They\nadministered one end of a single pair of wires leading to Baltimore and\nWashington. Incoming messages were written down by hand, relayed by ferry\nacross the Hudson River to the Liberty Street pier, and delivered to the first\noffice of the Magnetic Telegraph Company at 16 Wall Street.\n\nIn London, where the river caused less difficulty, capitalists formed the\nElectric Telegraph Company and began to lay their first copper wires, twisted\ninto cables, covered with gutta-percha, and drawn through iron pipes, mainly\nalongside new railroad tracks. To house the central office the company rented\nFounders’ Hall, Lothbury, opposite the Bank of England, and advertised its\npresence by installing an electric clock—modern and apt, for already railroad\ntime was telegraphic time. By 1849 the telegraph office boasted eight\ninstruments, operated day and night. Four hundred battery cells provided the\npower. “We see before us a stuccoed wall, ornamented with an electric\nilluminated clock,” reported Andrew Wynter, a journalist, in 1854. “Who would\nthink that behind this narrow forehead lay the great brain—if we may so term\nit—of the nervous system of Britain?”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1211712)\nHe was neither the first nor the last to liken the electric telegraph to\nbiological wiring: comparing cables to nerves; the nation, or the whole earth,\nto the human body.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1212011)\n\nThe analogy linked one perplexing phenomenon with another. Electricity was an\nenigma wrapped in mystery verging on magic, and no one understood nerves,\neither. Nerves were at least known to conduct a form of electricity and thus,\nperhaps, to serve as conduits for the brain’s control of the body. Anatomists\nexamining nerve fibers wondered whether they might be insulated with the\nbody’s own version of gutta-percha. Maybe nerves were not just _like_ wires;\nmaybe they _were_ wires, carrying messages from the nether regions to the\nsensorium. Alfred Smee, in his 1849 _Elements of Electro-Biology_ , likened\nthe brain to a battery and the nerves to “bio-\ntelegraphs.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1212402) Like any overused\nmetaphor, this one soon grew ripe for satire. A newspaper reporter in Menlo\nPark, discovering Thomas A. Edison in the grip of a head cold, wrote: “The\ndoctor came and looked at him, explained the relations of the trigeminal\nnerves and their analogy to an electric telegraph with three wires, and\nobserved incidentally that in facial neuralgia each tooth might be regarded as\na telegraph station with an operator.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1212652)\nWhen the telephone arrived, it reinforced the analogy. “The time is close at\nhand,” declared _Scientific American_ in 1880, “when the scattered members of\ncivilized communities will be as closely united, so far as instant telephonic\ncommunication is concerned, as the various members of the body now are by the\nnervous system.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1212909) Considering how\nspeculative the analogy was, it turned out well. Nerves really do transmit\nmessages, and the telegraph and telephone did begin to turn human society, for\nthe first time, into something like a coherent organism.\n\nIn their earliest days these inventions inspired exhilaration without\nprecedent in the annals of technology. The excitement passed from place to\nplace in daily newspapers and monthly magazines and, more to the point, along\nthe wires themselves. A new sense of futurity arose: a sense that the world\nwas in a state of change, that life for one’s children and grandchildren would\nbe very different, all because of this force and its uses. “Electricity is the\npoetry of science,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1213170) an American\nhistorian declared in 1852.\n\nNot that anyone knew what electricity was. “An invisible, intangible,\nimponderable agent,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1213503) said one\nauthority. Everyone agreed that it involved a “peculiar condition” either of\nmolecules or of the ether (itself a nebulous, and ultimately doomed,\nconception). Thomas Browne, in the seventeenth century, described electrical\neffluvia as “threads of syrup, which elongate and contract.” In the\neighteenth, the kite-flying Benjamin Franklin proved “the sameness of\nlightning with electricity”—identifying those fearsome bolts from the sky with\nthe odd terrestrial sparks and currents. Franklin followed the Abbé Jean-\nAntoine Nollet, a natural philosopher and a bit of a showman, who said in\n1748, “Electricity in our hands is the same as thunder in the hands of nature”\nand to prove it organized an experiment employing a Leyden jar and iron wire\nto send a shock through two hundred Carthusian monks arranged in a circle one\nmile around. From the monks’ almost simultaneous hops, starts, jerks, and\ncries, onlookers judged that the message—its information content small but not\nzero—sped round the circle at fantastic speed.\n\nLater, it was Michael Faraday in England who did more than anyone to turn\nelectricity from magic to science, but even so, in 1854, when Faraday was at\nthe height of his investigations, Dionysius Lardner, the scientific writer who\nso admired Babbage, could quite accurately declare, “The World of Science is\nnot agreed as to the physical character of\nElectricity.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1213816) Some believed it to be a\nfluid “lighter and more subtle” than any gas; others suspected a compound of\ntwo fluids “having antagonistic properties”; and still others thought\nelectricity was not a fluid at all, but something analogous to sound: “a\nseries of undulations or vibrations.” _Harper’s Magazine_ warned that\n“current” was just a metaphor and added mysteriously, “We are not to conceive\nof the electricity as carrying the message that we write, but rather as\nenabling the operator at the other end of the line to write a similar\none.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1214121)\n\nWhatever its nature, electricity was appreciated as a natural force placed\nunder human control. A young New York newspaper, _The Times_ , explained it by\nway of contrast with steam:\n\n> > Both of them are powerful and even formidable agents wrested from nature,\n> by the skill and power of man. But electricity is by far the subtlest energy\n> of the two. It is an original natural element, while steam is an artificial\n> production.… Electricity combined with magnetism, is a more subjective\n> agent, and when evolved for transmission is ready to go forth, a safe and\n> expeditious messenger to the ends of the habitable\n> globe.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1214408)\n\nLooking back, rhapsodists found the modern age foretold in a verse from the\nbook of Job: “Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee,\nHere we are?”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1214665)\n\nBut lightning did not _say_ anything—it dazzled, cracked, and burned, but to\nconvey a message would require some ingenuity. In human hands, electricity\ncould hardly accomplish anything, at first. It could not make a light brighter\nthan a spark. It was silent. But it could be sent along wires to great\ndistances—this was discovered early—and it seemed to turn wires into faint\nmagnets. Those wires could be long: no one had found any limit to the range of\nthe electric current. It took no time at all to see what this meant for the\nancient dream of long-distance communication. It meant sympathetic needles.\n\nPractical problems had to be solved: making wires, insulating them, storing\ncurrents, measuring them. A whole realm of engineering had to be invented.\nApart from the engineering was a separate problem: the problem of the message\nitself. This was more a logic puzzle than a technical one. It was a problem of\ncrossing levels, from kinetics to meaning. What form would the message take?\nHow would the telegraph convert this fluid into words? By virtue of magnetism,\nthe influence propagated across a distance could perform work upon physical\nobjects, such as needles, or iron filings, or even small levers. People had\ndifferent ideas: the electromagnet might sound an alarum-bell; might govern\nthe motion of wheel-work; might turn a handle, which might carry a pencil (but\nnineteenth-century engineering was not up to robotic handwriting). Or the\ncurrent might discharge a cannon. Imagine discharging a cannon by sending a\nsignal from miles away! Would-be inventors naturally looked to previous\ncommunications technologies, but the precedents were mostly the wrong sort.\n\nBefore there were electric telegraphs, there were just telegraphs: _les\ntélégraphes_ , invented and named by Claude Chappe in France during the\nRevolution.*[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1214898) They were optical; a\n“telegraph” was a tower for sending signals to other towers in line of sight.\nThe task was to devise a signaling system more efficient and flexible than,\nsay, bonfires. Working with his messaging partner, his brother Ignace, Claude\ntried out a series of different schemes, evolving over a period of years.\n\nThe first was peculiar and ingenious. The Chappe brothers set a pair of\npendulum clocks to beat in synchrony, each with its pointer turning around a\ndial at relatively high speed. They experimented with this in their hometown,\nBrûlon, about one hundred miles west of Paris. Ignace, the sender, would wait\ntill the pointer reached an agreed number and at that instant signal by\nringing a bell or firing a gun or, more often, banging upon a _casserole_.\nUpon hearing the sound, Claude, stationed a quarter mile away, would read the\nappropriate number off his own clock. He could convert number to words by\nlooking them up in a prearranged list. This notion of communication via\nsynchronized clocks reappeared in the twentieth century, in physicists’\nthought experiments and in electronic devices, but in 1791 it led nowhere. One\ndrawback was that the two stations had to be linked both by sight and by\nsound—and if they were, the clocks had little to add. Another was the problem\nof getting the clocks synchronized in the first place and keeping them\nsynchronized. Ultimately, fast long-distance messaging was what made\nsynchronization possible—not the reverse. The scheme collapsed under the\nweight of its own cleverness.\n\nMeanwhile the Chappes managed to draw more of their brothers, Pierre and René,\ninto the project, with a corps of municipal officers and royal notaries to\nbear witness.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1215174) The next attempt\ndispensed with clockwork and sound. The Chappes constructed a large wooden\nframe with five sliding shutters, to be raised and lowered with pulleys. By\nusing each possible combination, this “telegraph” could transmit an alphabet\nof thirty-two symbols—25, another binary code, though the details do not\nsurvive. Claude was pleading for money from the newly formed Legislative\nAssembly, so he tried this hopeful message from Brûlon: “ _L’Assembleé\nnationale récompensera les experiences utiles au public_ ” (“The National\nAssembly will reward experiments useful to the public”). The eight words took\n6 minutes, 20 seconds to transmit, and they failed to come true.\n\nRevolutionary France was both a good and a bad place for modernistic\nexperimentation. When Claude erected a prototype telegraph in the parc Saint-\nFargeau, in the northeast of Paris, a suspicious mob burned it to the ground,\nfearful of secret messaging. Citizen Chappe continued looking for a technology\nas swift and reliable as that other new device, the guillotine. He designed an\napparatus with a great crossbeam supporting two giant arms manipulated by\nropes. Like so many early machines, this was somewhat anthropomorphic in form.\nThe arms could take any of seven angles, at 45-degree increments (not eight,\nbecause one would leave the arm hidden behind the beam), and the beam, too,\ncould rotate, all under the control of an operator down below, manipulating a\nsystem of cranks and pulleys. To perfect this complex mechanism Chappe\nenlisted Abraham-Louis Breguet, the well-known watchmaker.\n\nAs intricate as the control problem was, the question of devising a suitable\ncode proved even more difficult. From a strictly mechanical point of view, the\narms and the beam could take any angle at all—the possibilities were\ninfinite—but for efficient signaling Chappe had to limit the possibilities.\nThe fewer meaningful positions, the less likelihood of confusion. He chose\nonly two for the crossbeam, on top of the seven for each arm, giving a symbol\nspace of 98 possible arrangements (7 × 7 × 2). Rather than just use these for\nletters and numerals, Chappe set out to devise an elaborate code. Certain\nsignals were reserved for error correction and control: start and stop,\nacknowledgment, delay, conflict (a tower could not send messages in both\ndirections at once), and failure. Others were used in pairs, pointing the\noperator to pages and line numbers in special code books with more than eight\nthousand potential entries: words and syllables as well as proper names of\npeople and places. All this remained a carefully guarded secret. After all,\nthe messages were to be broadcast in the sky, for anyone to see. Chappe took\nit for granted that the telegraph network of which he dreamed would be a\ndepartment of the state, government owned and operated. He saw it not as an\ninstrument of knowledge or of riches, but as an instrument of power. “The day\nwill come,” he wrote, “when the Government will be able to achieve the\ngrandest idea we can possibly have of power, by using the telegraph system in\norder to spread directly, every day, every hour, and simultaneously, its\ninfluence over the whole republic.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1215475)\n\nWith the country at war and authority now residing with the National\nConvention, Chappe managed to gain the attention of some influential\nlegislators. “Citizen Chappe offers an ingenious method to write in the air,\nusing a small number of symbols, simply formed from straight line\nsegments,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1215982) reported one of them,\nGilbert Romme, in 1793. He persuaded the Convention to appropriate six\nthousand francs for the construction of three telegraph towers in a line north\nof Paris, seven to nine miles apart. The Chappe brothers moved rapidly now and\nby the end of summer arranged a triumphant demonstration for the watching\ndeputies. The deputies liked what they saw: a means of receiving news from the\nmilitary frontier and transmitting their orders and decrees. They gave Chappe\na salary, the use of a government horse, and an official appointment to the\npost of _ingénieur télégraphe_. He began work on a line of stations 120 miles\nlong, from the Louvre in Paris to Lille, on the northern border. In less than\na year he had eighteen in operation, and the first messages arrived from\nLille: happily, news of victories over the Prussians and Austrians. The\nConvention was ecstatic. One deputy named a pantheon of four great human\ninventions: printing, gunpowder, the compass, and “the language of telegraph\nsigns.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1216260) He was right to focus on the\nlanguage. In terms of hardware—ropes, levers, and wooden beams—the Chappes had\ninvented nothing new.\n\n![](images/00027.jpg)\n\nA CHAPPE TELEGRAPH\n\nConstruction began on stations in branches extending east to Strasbourg, west\nto Brest, and south to Lyon. When Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in 1799, he\nordered a message sent in every direction—“ _Paris est tranquille et les bons\ncitoyens sont contents_ ” (“Paris is quiet and the good citizens are\nhappy”)—and soon commissioned a line of new stations all the way to Milan. The\ntelegraph system was setting a new standard for speed of communication, since\nthe only real competition was a rider on horseback. But speed could be\nmeasured in two ways: in terms of distance or in terms of symbols and words.\nChappe once claimed that a signal could go from Toulon to Paris—a line of 120\nstations across 475 miles—in just ten or twelve\nminutes.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1216486) But he could not make that\nclaim for a full message, even a relatively short one. Three signals per\nminute was the most that could be expected of even the fastest telegraph\noperator. The next operator in the chain, watching through a telescope, had to\nlog each signal by hand in a notebook, reproduce it by turning his own cranks\nand pulleys, and watch to make sure it was received correctly by the next\nstation. The signal chain was vulnerable and delicate: rain, fog, or an\ninattentive operator would break any message. When success rates were measured\nin the 1840s, only two out of three messages were found to arrive within a day\nduring the warm months, and in winter the rate dropped to one in three. Coding\nand decoding took time, too, but only at the beginning and end of the line.\nOperators at intermediate stations were meant to relay signals without\nunderstanding them. Indeed, many _stationaires_ were illiterate.\n\n![](images/00028.jpg)\n\nTHE FRENCH TELEGRAPH NETWORK IN ITS HEYDAY\n\nWhen messages did arrive, they could not always be trusted. Many relay\nstations meant many chances for error. Children everywhere know this, from\nplaying the messaging game known in Britain as Chinese Whispers, in China as\n![](images/00029.jpg), in Turkey as From Ear to Ear, and in the modern United\nStates simply as Telephone. When his colleagues disregarded the problem of\nerror correction, Ignace Chappe complained, “They have probably never\nperformed experiments with more than two or three\nstations.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1216878)\n\nToday the old telegraphs are forgotten, but they were a sensation in their\ntime. In London, a Drury Lane entertainer and songwriter named Charles Dibdin\nput the invention into a 1794 musical show and foresaw a marvelous future:\n\n> If you’ll only just promise you’ll none of you laugh,\n>\n> I’ll be after explaining the French telegraph!\n>\n> A machine that’s endow’d with such wonderful pow’r,\n>\n> It writes, reads, and sends news fifty miles in an hour.\n>\n> …\n>\n> Oh! the dabblers in lott’ries will grow rich as Jews:\n>\n> ’Stead of flying of pigeons, to bring them the news,\n>\n> They’ll a telegraph place upon Old Ormond Quay;\n>\n> Put another ’board ship, in the midst of the sea.\n>\n> …\n>\n> Adieu, penny-posts! mails and coaches, adieu;\n>\n> Your occupation’s gone, ’tis all over wid you:\n>\n> In your place, telegraphs on our houses we’ll see,\n>\n> To tell time, conduct lightning, dry shirts, and send\n> news.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1217161)\n\nThe telegraph towers spread across Europe and beyond, and their ruins dot the\ncountrysides today. Telegraph Hill, Telegrafberget, Telegraphen-Berg are\nvestigial place names. Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium were early to develop\nsystems on the French model. Germany soon followed. A line between Calcutta\nand Chunar began operating in 1823; between Alexandria and Cairo in 1824; and\nin Russia, Nicholas I organized 220 stations from Warsaw to St. Petersburg and\nMoscow. They held dominion over the world’s communication and then, faster\nthan they had arisen, went obsolete. Colonel Taliaferro Shaffner, a Kentucky\ninventor and historian, traveled to Russia in 1859 and was struck by the\ntowers’ height and their beauty, the care taken with their painting and\nlandscaping with flowers, and by their sudden, universal death.\n\n> > These stations are now silent. No movements of the indicators are to be\n> seen. They are still upon their high positions, fast yielding to the wasting\n> hand of time. The electric wire, though less grand in its appearance,\n> traverses the empire, and with burning flames inscribes in the distance the\n> will of the emperor to sixty-six millions of human beings scattered over his\n> wide-spread dominions.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1217497)\n\nIn Shaffner’s mind this was a one-way conversation. The sixty-six millions\nwere not talking back to the emperor, nor to one another.\n\nWhat was to be said, when writing in the air? Claude Chappe had proposed,\n“Anything that could be the subject of a\ncorrespondence.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1217730) But his\nexample—“Lukner has left for Mons to besiege that city, Bender is advancing\nfor its defense”—made clear what he meant: dispatches of military and state\nimport. Later Chappe proposed sending other types of information: shipping\nnews, and financial quotations from bourses and stock exchanges. Napoleon\nwould not allow it, though he did use the telegraph to proclaim the birth of\nhis son, Napoleon II, in 1811. A communications infrastructure built with\nenormous government investment and capable of transmitting some hundreds of\ntotal words per day could hardly be used for private messaging. That was\nunimaginable—and when, in the next century, it became imaginable, some\ngovernments found it undesirable. No sooner did entrepreneurs begin to\norganize private telegraphy than France banned it outright: an 1837 law\nmandated imprisonment and fines for “anyone performing unauthorized\ntransmissions of signals from one place to another, with the aid of\ntelegraphic machines or by any other\nmeans.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1218001) The idea of a global nervous\nsystem had to arise elsewhere. In the next year, 1838, the French authorities\nreceived a visit from an American with a proposal for a “telegraph” utilizing\nelectrical wires: Samuel F. B. Morse. They turned him down flat. Compared to\nthe majestic semaphore, electricity seemed gimcrack and insecure. No one could\ninterfere with telegraph signals in the sky, but wire could be cut by\nsaboteurs. Jules Guyot, a physician and scientist assigned to assess the\ntechnology, sniffed, “What can one expect of a few wretched\nwires?”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1218201) What indeed.\n\n![](images/00030.jpg)\n\nTHE TELEGRAPH AT MONTMARTRE\n\nThe care and feeding of the delicate galvanic impulse presented a harsh set of\ntechnical challenges, and a different set appeared where electricity met\nlanguage: where words had to be transmuted into a twinkling in the wire. The\ncrossing point between electricity and language—also the interface between\ndevice and human—required new ingenuity. Many different schemes occurred to\ninventors. Virtually all were based in one way or another on the written\nalphabet, employing letters as an intermediate layer. This seemed so natural\nas to be not worth remarking. _Telegraph_ meant “far writing,” after all. So\nin 1774 Georges-Louis Le Sage of Geneva arranged twenty-four separate wires to\ndesignate twenty-four letters, each wire conveying just enough current to stir\na piece of gold leaf or a pith ball suspended in a glass jar or “other bodies\nthat can be as easily attracted, and are, at the same time, easily\nvisible.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1218376) That was too many wires to be\npracticable. A Frenchman named Lomond in 1787 ran a single wire across his\napartment and claimed to be able to signal different letters by making a pith\nball dance in different directions. “It appears that he has formed an alphabet\nof motions,” reported a witness, but apparently only Lomond’s wife could\nunderstand the code. In 1809 a German, Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring, made a\nbubble telegraph. Current passing through wires in a vessel of water produced\nbubbles of hydrogen; each wire, and thus each jet of bubbles, could indicate a\nsingle letter. While he was at it, von Sömmerring managed to make electricity\nring a bell: he balanced a spoon in the water, upside down, so that enough\nbubbles would make it tilt, releasing a weight, driving a lever, and ringing\nthe bell. “This secondary object, the alarum,” he wrote in his diary, “cost me\na great deal of reflection and many useless trials with\nwheelwork.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1218679) Across the Atlantic, an\nAmerican named Harrison Gray Dyer tried sending signals by making electric\nsparks form nitric acid that discolored litmus\npaper.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1218949) He strung a wire on trees and\nstakes around a Long Island race track. The litmus paper had to be moved by\nhand.\n\nThen came needles. The physicist André-Marie Ampère, a developer of the\ngalvanometer, proposed using that as a signaling device: it was a needle\ndeflected by electromagnetism—a compass pointing to a momentary artificial\nnorth. He, too, thought in terms of one needle for every letter. In Russia,\nBaron Pavel Schilling demonstrated a system with five needles and later\nreduced that to one: he assigned combinations of right and left signals to the\nletters and numerals. At Göttingen in 1833 the mathematician Carl Friedrich\nGauss, working with a physicist, Wilhelm Weber, organized a similar scheme\nwith one needle. The first deflection of the needle gave two possible signals,\nleft or right. Two deflections combined gave four more possibilities (right +\nright, right + left, left + right, and left + left). Three deflections gave\neight combinations, and four gave sixteen, for a total of thirty distinct\nsignals. An operator would use pauses to separate the signals. Gauss and Weber\norganized their alphabet of deflections logically, beginning with the vowels\nand otherwise taking letters and digits in order:\n\n> right | = _a_  \n> ---|---  \n> left | = _e_  \n> right, right | = _i_  \n> right, left | = o  \n> left, right | = _u_  \n> left, left | = _b_  \n> right, right, right | = _c_ (and _k_)  \n> right, right, left | = _d_  \n> etc.  \n  \nThis scheme for encoding letters was binary, in a way. Each minimal unit, each\nlittle piece of signal, amounted to a choice between two possibilities, left\nor right. Each letter required a number of such choices, and that number was\nnot predetermined. It could be one, as in right for _a_ and left for _e_. It\ncould be more, so the scheme was open-ended, allowing an alphabet of as many\nletters as needed. Gauss and Weber strung a doubled wire over a mile of houses\nand steeples between the Göttingen observatory and the physics institute. What\nthey managed to say to each other has not been preserved.\n\nFar away from these inventors’ workrooms, the _telegraph_ still meant towers,\nsemaphores, shutters, and flags, but enthusiasm for new possibilities was\nbeginning to build. Lecturing to the Boston Marine Society in 1833, a lawyer\nand philologist, John Pickering, declared, “It must be evident to the most\ncommon observer, that no means of conveying intelligence can ever be devised,\nthat shall exceed or even equal the rapidity of the Telegraph, for, with the\nexception of the scarcely perceptible relay at each station, its rapidity may\nbe compared with that of light itself.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1219428)\nHe was thinking particularly of the Telegraph on Central Wharf, a Chappe-like\ntower communicating shipping news with three other stations in a twelve-mile\nline across Boston Harbor. Meanwhile, dozens of young newspapers around the\nnation were modernistically calling themselves “ _The Telegraph_.” They, too,\nwere in the far-writing business.\n\n“Telegraphy is an element of power and\norder,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1219712) Abraham Chappe had said, but\nthe rising financial and mercantile classes were the next to grasp the value\nof information leaping across distance. Only two hundred miles separated the\nStock Exchange on Threadneedle Street in London from the Bourse at the Palais\nBrongniart, but two hundred miles meant days. Fortunes could be made by\nbridging that gap. For speculators a private telegraph would be as useful as a\ntime machine. The Rothschild banking family was using pigeons as postal\ncarriers and, more reliably, a small fleet of boats to carry messengers across\nthe Channel. The phenomenon of fast information from a distance, having been\ndiscovered, generated a cascade of excitement. Pickering in Boston did the\nmath: “If there are now essential advantages to business in obtaining\nintelligence from New York in two days, or less, or at the rate of eight or\nten miles an hour, any man can perceive that there may be a proportionate\nbenefit, when we can transmit the same information for that distance by\ntelegraph at the rate of four miles in a minute, or in the space of a single\nhour, from New York to Boston.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1220095) The\ninterest of governments in receiving military bulletins and projecting\nauthority was surpassed by the desires of capitalists and newspapers,\nrailroads and shipping companies. Still, in the sprawling United States, even\nthe pressure of commerce was not enough to make optical telegraphy a reality.\nOnly one prototype succeeded in linking two cities: New York and Philadelphia,\nin 1840. It transmitted stock prices and then lottery numbers and then was\nobsolete.\n\nAll the would-be inventors of the electrical telegraph—and there were\nmany—worked from the same toolkit. They had their wires, and they had magnetic\nneedles. They had batteries: galvanic cells, linked together, producing\nelectricity from the reaction of metal strips immersed in acid baths. They did\nnot have lights. They did not have motors. They had whatever mechanisms they\ncould construct from wood and brass: pins, screws, wheels, springs, and\nlevers. In the end they had the shared target at which they all aimed: the\nletters of the alphabet. (Edward Davy thought it was necessary to explain, in\n1836, how and why the letters would suffice: “A single letter may be indicated\nat a time, each letter being taken down by the attendant as it arrives, so as\nto form words and sentences; but it will be easy to see that, from the\ninfinite changes upon a number of letters, a great number of ordinary\ncommunications may be conveyed.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1220339)) Along\nwith this common stock list, in Vienna, Paris, London, Göttingen, St.\nPetersburg, and the United States, these pioneers shared a sense of their\nexcited, competitive landscape, but no one knew clearly what anyone else was\ndoing. They could not keep up with the relevant science; crucial advances in\nthe science of electricity remained unknown to the people who most needed\nthem. Every inventor ached to understand what happened to current flowing\nthrough wires of different lengths and thickness, and they continued to\nstruggle for more than a decade after Georg Ohm, in Germany, worked out a\nprecise mathematical theory for current, voltage, and resistance. Such news\ntraveled slowly.\n\nIt was in this context that Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, in the United\nStates, and, in England, William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone made the\nelectric telegraph a reality and a business. In one way or another, all of\nthem later claimed to have “invented” the telegraph, though none of them had\ndone so—certainly not Morse. Their partnerships were destined to end in\nbrutal, turbulent, and bitter patent disputes embroiling most of the leading\nelectrical scientists on two continents. The trail of invention, leading\nthrough so many countries, had been poorly recorded and even more poorly\ncommunicated.\n\nIn England, Cooke was a young entrepreneur—he saw a prototype needle telegraph\nwhile traveling in Heidelberg—and Wheatstone a King’s College, London,\nphysicist with whom Cooke formed a partnership in 1837. Wheatstone had\nperformed experiments on the velocity of sound and of electricity, and once\nagain the real problem lay in connecting the physics with language. They\nconsulted England’s authority on electricity, Michael Faraday, and Peter\nRoget, author of a _Treatise on Electro-Magnetism_ as well as the system of\nverbal classification he called the _Thesaurus_. The Cooke-Wheatstone\ntelegraph went through a series of prototypes. One used six wires to form\nthree circuits, each controlling a magnetic needle. “I worked out every\npossible permutation and practical combination of the signals given by the\nthree needles, and I thus obtained an alphabet of twenty-six\nsignals,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1220621) noted Cooke, somewhat\nobscurely. There was also an alarm, in case the operator’s attention wandered\nfrom the apparatus; Cooke said he had been inspired by the only mechanical\ndevice he knew well: a musical snuffbox. In the next version, a synchronized\npair of rotating clockwork disks displayed the letters of the alphabet through\na slot. More ingenious still, and just as awkward, was a five-needle design:\ntwenty letters were arranged on a diamond-shaped grid and an operator, by\ndepressing numbered buttons, would cause two of five needles to point,\nuniquely, to the desired letter. This Cooke-Wheatstone telegraph managed to do\nwithout _C, J, Q, U, X_ , and _Z_. Their American competitor, Vail, later\ndescribed the operation as follows:\n\n> > Suppose the message to be sent from the Paddington station to the Slough\n> station, is this, “We have met the enemy and they are ours.” The operator at\n> Paddington presses down the buttons, 11 and 18, for signalizing upon the\n> dial of the Slough station, the letter W. The operator there, who is\n> supposed to be constantly on watch, observes the two needles pointing at W.\n> He writes it down, or calls it aloud, to another, who records it, taking,\n> according to a calculation given in a recent account, two seconds at least\n> for each signal.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1220948)\n\nVail considered this inefficient. He was in a position to be smug.\n\nAs for Samuel Finley Breese Morse, his later recollections came in the context\nof controversy—what his son called “the wordy battles waged in the scientific\nworld over the questions of priority, exclusive discovery or invention,\nindebtedness to others, and conscious or unconscious\nplagiarism.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1221343) All these thrived on\nfailures of communication and record-keeping. Educated at Yale College, the\nson of a Massachusetts preacher, Morse was an artist, not a scientist. In the\n1820s and 1830s he spent much of his time traveling in England, France,\nSwitzerland, and Italy to study painting. It was on one of these trips that he\nfirst heard about electric telegraphy or, in the terms of his memoirs, had his\nsudden insight: “like a flash of the subtle fluid which afterwards became his\nservant,” as his son put it. Morse told a friend who was rooming with him in\nParis: “The mails in our country are too slow; this French telegraph is\nbetter, and would do even better in our clear atmosphere than here, where half\nthe time fogs obscure the skies. But this will not be fast enough—the\nlightning would serve us better.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1221611) As he\ndescribed his epiphany, it was an insight not about lightning but about signs:\n“It would not be difficult to construct _a system of signs_ by which\nintelligence could be instantaneously\ntransmitted.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1221877)\n\n![](images/00031.jpg)\n\nTELEGRAPHIC WRITING BY MORSE’S FIRST INSTRUMENT\n\n![](images/00032.jpg)\n\nALFRED VAIL’S TELEGRAPH “KEY”\n\nMorse had a great insight from which all the rest flowed. Knowing nothing\nabout pith balls, bubbles, or litmus paper, he saw that a sign could be made\nfrom something simpler, more fundamental, and less tangible—the most minimal\nevent, the closing and opening of a circuit. Never mind needles. The electric\ncurrent flowed and was interrupted, and the interruptions could be organized\nto create meaning. The idea was simple, but Morse’s first devices were\nconvoluted, involving clockwork, wooden pendulums, pencils, ribbons of paper,\nrollers, and cranks. Vail, an experienced machinist, cut all this back. For\nthe sending end, Vail devised what became an iconic piece of user interface: a\nsimple spring-loaded lever, with which an operator could control the circuit\nby the touch of a finger. First he called this lever a “correspondent”; then\njust a “key.” Its simplicity made it at least an order of magnitude faster\nthan the buttons and cranks employed by Wheatstone and Cooke. With the\ntelegraph key, an operator could send signals—which were, after all, mere\ninterruptions of the current—at a rate of hundreds per minute.\n\nSo at one end they had a lever, for closing and opening the circuit, and at\nthe other end the current controlled an electromagnet. One of them, probably\nVail, thought of putting the two together. The magnet could operate the lever.\nThis combination (invented more or less simultaneously by Joseph Henry at\nPrinceton and Edward Davy in England) was named the “relay,” from the word for\na fresh horse that replaced an exhausted one. It removed the greatest obstacle\nstanding in the way of long-distance electrical telegraphy: the weakening of\ncurrents as they passed through lengths of wire. A weakened current could\nstill operate a relay, enabling a new circuit, powered by a new battery. The\nrelay had greater potential than its inventors realized. Besides letting a\nsignal propagate itself, a relay might reverse the signal. And relays might\ncombine signals from more than one source. But that was for later.\n\nThe turning point came in 1844, both in England and the United States. Cooke\nand Wheatstone had their first line up and running along the railway from the\nPaddington station. Morse and Vail had theirs from Washington to the Pratt\nStreet railway station in Baltimore, on wires wrapped in yarn and tar,\nsuspended from twenty-foot wooden posts. The communications traffic was light\nat first, but Morse was able to report proudly to Congress that an instrument\ncould transmit thirty characters per minute and that the lines had “remained\nundisturbed from the wantonness or evil disposition of any one.” From the\noutset the communications content diverged sharply—comically—from the martial\nand official dispatches familiar to French telegraphists. In England the first\nmessages recorded in the telegraph book at Paddington concerned lost luggage\nand retail transactions. “Send a messenger to Mr Harris, Duke-street,\nManchester-square, and request him to send 6 lbs of white bait and 4 lbs of\nsausages by the 5.30 train to Mr Finch of Windsor; they must be sent by 5.30\ndown train, or not at all.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1222114) At the\nstroke of the new year, the superintendent at Paddington sent salutations to\nhis counterpart in Slough and received a reply that the wish was a half-minute\nearly; midnight had not yet arrived\nthere.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1222348) That morning, a druggist in\nSlough named John Tawell poisoned his mistress, Sarah Hart, and ran for the\ntrain to Paddington. A telegraph message outraced him with his description\n(“in the garb of a kwaker, with a brown great coat\non”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1222673)—no _Q_ ’s in the English system);\nhe was captured in London and hanged in March. The drama filled the newspapers\nfor months. It was later said of the telegraph wires, “Them’s the cords that\nhung John Tawell.” In April, a Captain Kennedy, at the South-Western Railway\nterminus, played a game of chess with a Mr. Staunton, at Gosport; it was\nreported that “in conveying the moves, the electricity travelled backward and\nforward during the game upwards of 10,000\nmiles.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1223113) The newspapers loved that\nstory, too—and, more and more, they valued any story revealing the marvels of\nthe electric telegraph.\n\nWhen the English and the American enterprises opened their doors to the\ngeneral public, it was far from clear who, besides the police and the\noccasional chess player, would line up to pay the tariff. In Washington, where\npricing began in 1845 at one-quarter cent per letter, total revenues for the\nfirst three months amounted to less than two hundred dollars. The next year,\nwhen a Morse line opened between New York and Philadelphia, the traffic grew a\nlittle faster. “When you consider that business is extremely dull [and] we\nhave not yet the confidence of the public,” a company official wrote, “you\nwill see we are all well satisfied with results so\nfar.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1223423) He predicted that revenues would\nsoon rise to fifty dollars a day. Newspaper reporters caught on. In the fall\nof 1846 Alexander Jones sent his first story by wire from New York City to the\nWashington Union: an account of the launch of the USS _Albany_ at the Brooklyn\nNavy Yard.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1223796) In England a writer for _The\nMorning Chronicle_ described the thrill of receiving his first report across\nthe Cooke-Wheatstone telegraph line,\n\n> > the first instalment of the intelligence by a sudden stir of the\n> stationary needle, and the shrill ring of the alarum. We looked delightedly\n> into the taciturn face of our friend, the mystic dial, and pencilled down\n> with rapidity in our note-book, what were his utterances some ninety miles\n> off.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1224037)\n\nThis was contagious. Some worried that the telegraph would be the death of\nnewspapers, heretofore “the rapid and indispensable carrier of commercial,\npolitical and other intelligence,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1224346) as\nan American journalist put it.\n\n> > For this purpose the newspapers will become emphatically useless.\n> Anticipated at every point by the lightning wings of the Telegraph, they can\n> only deal in local “items” or abstract speculations. Their power to create\n> sensations, even in election campaigns, will be greatly lessened—as the\n> infallible Telegraph will contradict their falsehoods as fast as they can\n> publish them.\n\nUndaunted, newspapers could not wait to put the technology to work. Editors\nfound that any dispatch seemed more urgent and thrilling with the label\n“Communicated by Electric Telegraph.” Despite the expense—at first, typically,\nfifty cents for ten words—the newspapers became the telegraph services’ most\nenthusiastic patrons. Within a few years, 120 provincial newspapers were\ngetting reports from Parliament nightly. News bulletins from the Crimean War\nradiated from London to Liverpool, York, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol,\nBirmingham, and Hull. “Swifter than a rocket could fly the distance, like a\nrocket it bursts and is again carried by the diverging wires into a dozen\nneighbouring towns,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1224594) one journalist\nnoted. He saw dangers, though: “Intelligence, thus hastily gathered and\ntransmitted, has also its drawbacks, and is not so trustworthy as the news\nwhich starts later and travels slower.” The relationship between the telegraph\nand the newspaper was symbiotic. Positive feedback loops amplified the effect.\nBecause the telegraph was an information technology, it served as an agent of\nits own ascendency.\n\nThe global expansion of the telegraph continued to surprise even its backers.\nWhen the first telegraph office opened in New York City on Wall Street, its\nbiggest problem was the Hudson River. The Morse system ran a line sixty miles\nup the eastern side until it reached a point narrow enough to stretch a wire\nacross. Within a few years, though, an insulated cable was laid under the\nharbor. Across the English Channel, a submarine cable twenty-five miles long\nmade the connection between Dover and Calais in 1851. Soon after, a\nknowledgeable authority warned: “All idea of connecting Europe with America,\nby lines extending directly across the Atlantic, is utterly impracticable and\nabsurd.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1224830) That was in 1852; the\nimpossible was accomplished by 1858, at which point Queen Victoria and\nPresident Buchanan exchanged pleasantries and _The New York Times_ announced\n“a result so practical, yet so inconceivable … so full of hopeful prognostics\nfor the future of mankind … one of the grand way-marks in the onward and\nupward march of the human intellect.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1225091)\nWhat was the essence of the achievement? “The transmission of thought, the\nvital impulse of matter.” The excitement was global but the effects were\nlocal. Fire brigades and police stations linked their communications. Proud\nshopkeepers advertised their ability to take telegraph orders.\n\nInformation that just two years earlier had taken days to arrive at its\ndestination could now be there—anywhere—in seconds. This was not a doubling or\ntripling of transmission speed; it was a leap of many orders of magnitude. It\nwas like the bursting of a dam whose presence had not even been known. The\nsocial consequences could not have been predicted, but some were observed and\nappreciated almost immediately. People’s sense of the weather began to\nchange—weather, that is, as a generalization, an abstraction. Simple weather\nreports began crossing the wires on behalf of corn speculators: _Derby, very\ndull; York, fine; Leeds, fine; Nottingham, no rain but dull and\ncold_.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1225366) The very idea of a “weather\nreport” was new. It required some approximation of instant knowledge of a\ndistant place. The telegraph enabled people to think of weather as a\nwidespread and interconnected affair, rather than an assortment of local\nsurprises. “The phenomena of the atmosphere, the mysteries of meteors, the\ncause and effect of skiey combinations, are no longer matters of superstition\nor of panic to the husbandman, the sailor or the\nshepherd,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1225579) noted an enthusiastic\ncommentator in 1848:\n\n> > The telegraph comes in to tell him, for his every-day uses and\n> observances, not only that “fair weather cometh out of the north,” but the\n> electric wire can tell him in a moment the character of the weather\n> simultaneously in all quarters of our island.… In this manner, the telegraph\n> may be made a vast national barometer, electricity becoming the handmaid of\n> the mercury.\n\nThis was a transformative idea. In 1854 the government established a\nMeteorological Office in the Board of Trade. The department’s chief, Admiral\nRobert FitzRoy, formerly a captain of HMS _Beagle_ , moved into an office on\nKing Street, furnished it with barometers, aneroids, and stormglasses, and\ndispatched observers equipped with the same instruments to ports all around\nthe coastline. They telegraphed their cloud and wind reports twice daily.\nFitzRoy began issuing weather predictions, which he dubbed “forecasts,” and in\n1860 _The Times_ began publishing these daily. Meteorologists began to\nunderstand that all great winds, when seen in the large, were circular, or at\nleast “highly curved.”\n\nThe most fundamental concepts were now in play as a consequence of\ninstantaneous communication between widely separated points. Cultural\nobservers began to say that the telegraph was “annihilating” time and space.\nIt “enables us to send communications, by means of the mysterious fluid, with\nthe quickness of thought, and to annihilate time as well as\nspace,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1225766) announced an American telegraph\nofficial in 1860. This was an exaggeration that soon became a cliché. The\ntelegraph did seem to vitiate or curtail time in one specific sense: time as\nan obstacle or encumbrance to human intercourse. “For all practical purposes,”\none newspaper announced, “time, in the transit, may be regarded as entirely\neliminated.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1226068) It was the same with\nspace. “Distance and time have been so changed in our imaginations,” said\nJosiah Latimer Clark, an English telegraph engineer, “that the globe has been\npractically reduced in magnitude, and there can be no doubt that our\nconception of its dimensions is entirely different to that held by our\nforefathers.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1226286)\n\nFormerly all time was local: when the sun was highest, that was noon. Only a\nvisionary (or an astronomer) would know that people in a different place lived\nby a different clock. Now time could be either local or standard, and the\ndistinction baffled most people. The railroads required standard time, and the\ntelegraph made it feasible. For standard time to prevail took decades; the\nprocess could only begin in the 1840s, when the Astronomer Royal arranged\nwires from the Observatory in Greenwich to the Electric Telegraph Company in\nLothbury, intending to synchronize the clocks of the nation. Previously, the\nstate of the art in time-signaling technology was a ball dropped from a mast\natop the observatory dome. When faraway places were coordinated in time, they\ncould finally measure their longitude precisely. The key to measuring\nlongitude was knowing the time someplace else and the distance to that place.\nShips therefore carried clocks, preserving time in imperfect mechanical\ncapsules. Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Exploring Expedition used the\nfirst Morse line in 1844 to locate the Battle Monument in Baltimore at 1\nminute, 34.868 seconds east of the Capitol in\nWashington.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1226572)\n\nFar from annihilating time, synchrony extended its dominion. The very idea of\nsynchrony, and the awareness that the idea was new, made heads spin. _The New\nYork Herald_ declared:\n\n> > Professor Morse’s telegraph is not only an era in the transmission of\n> intelligence, but it has originated in the mind an entirely new class of\n> ideas, a new species of consciousness. Never before was any one conscious\n> that he knew with certainty what events were at that moment passing in a\n> distant city—40, 100, or 500 miles\n> off.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1226844)\n\nImagine, continued this exhilarated writer, that it is _now_ 11 o’clock. The\ntelegraph relays what a legislator is _now_ saying in Washington.\n\n> > It requires no small intellectual effort to realize that this is a fact\n> that _now_ is, and not one that _has been_.\n\nThis is a fact that _now_ is.\n\nHistory (and history making) changed, too. The telegraph caused the\npreservation of quantities of minutiae concerning everyday life. For a while,\nuntil it became impractical, the telegraph companies tried to maintain a\nrecord of every message. This was information storage without precedent.\n“Fancy some future Macaulay rummaging among such a store, and painting\ntherefrom the salient features of the social and commercial life of England in\nthe nineteenth century,” mused one essayist. “What might not be gathered some\nday in the twenty-first century from a record of the correspondence of an\nentire people?”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1227160) In 1845, after a year’s\nexperience with the line between Washington and Baltimore, Alfred Vail\nattempted a catalogue of all the telegraph had conveyed thus far. “Much\nimportant information,” he wrote,\n\n> > consisting of messages to and from merchants, members of Congress,\n> officers of the government, banks, brokers, police officers; parties, who by\n> agreement had met each other at the two stations, or had been sent for by\n> one of the parties; items of news, election returns, announcement of deaths,\n> inquiries respecting the health of families and individuals, the daily\n> proceedings of the Senate and House of Representatives, orders for goods,\n> inquiries respecting the sailing of vessels, proceedings of cases in the\n> various courts, summoning of witnesses, messages in relation to special and\n> express trains, invitations, the receipt of money at one station and its\n> payment at the other, for persons requesting the transmission of funds from\n> debtors, consultations of physicians\n> …[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1227400)\n\nThese diverse items had never before been aggregated under one heading. The\ntelegraph gave them their commonality. In patent applications and legal\nagreements, too, the inventors had reason to think about their topic in the\nbroadest possible terms: e.g., the giving, printing, stamping, or otherwise\ntransmitting of signals, or the sounding of alarms, or the communication of\nintelligence.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1227686)\n\nIn this time of conceptual change, mental readjustments were needed to\nunderstand the telegraph itself. Confusion inspired anecdotes, which often\nturned on awkward new meanings of familiar terms: innocent words like _send_ ,\nand heavily laden ones, like _message_. There was the woman who brought a dish\nof sauerkraut into the telegraph office in Karlsruhe to be “sent” to her son\nin Rastatt. She had heard of soldiers being “sent” to the front by telegraph.\nThere was the man who brought a “message” into the telegraph office in Bangor,\nMaine. The operator manipulated the telegraph key and then placed the paper on\nthe hook. The customer complained that the message had not been sent, because\nhe could still see it hanging on the hook. To _Harper’s New Monthly Magazine_\n, which recounted this story in 1873, the point was that even the “intelligent\nand well-informed” continued to find these matters inscrutable:\n\n> > The difficulty of forming a clear conception of the subject is increased\n> by the fact that while we have to deal with novel and strange facts, we have\n> also to use old words in novel and inconsistent\n> senses.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1227984)\n\nA message had seemed to be a physical object. That was always an illusion; now\npeople needed consciously to divorce their conception of the message from the\npaper on which it was written. Scientists, _Harper’s_ explained, will say that\nthe electric current “ _carries_ a message,” but one must not imagine that\nanything—any _thing_ —is transported. There is only “the action and reaction\nof an imponderable force, and the making of intelligible signals by its means\nat a distance.” No wonder people were misled. “Such language the world must,\nperhaps for a long time to come, continue to employ.”\n\nThe physical landscape changed, too. Wires everywhere made for strange\nornamentation, on city streets and country roads. “Telegraphic companies are\nrunning a race to take possession of the air over our\nheads,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1228256) wrote an English journalist,\nAndrew Wynter. “Look where we will aloft, we cannot avoid seeing either thick\ncables suspended by gossamer threads, or parallel lines of wire in immense\nnumbers sweeping from post to post, fixed on the house-tops and suspended over\nlong distances.” They did not for some time fade into the background. People\nlooked at the wires and thought of their great invisible cargo. “They string\nan instrument against the sky,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1228611) said\nRobert Frost, “Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken / Will run as hushed\nas when they were a thought.”\n\nThe wires resembled nothing in architecture and not much in nature. Writers\nseeking similes thought of spiders and their webs. They thought of labyrinths\nand mazes. And one more word seemed appropriate: the earth was being covered,\npeople said, with an iron _net-work_. “A net-work of nerves of iron wire,\nstrung with lightning, will ramify from the brain, New York, to the distant\nlimbs and members,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1228848) said the _New York\nTribune_. “The whole net-work of wires,” wrote _Harper’s_ , “all quivering\nfrom end to end with signals of human\nintelligence.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1229094)\n\nWynter offered a prediction. “The time is not\ndistant,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1229349) he wrote, “when everybody\nwill be able to talk with everybody without going out of the house.” He meant\n“talk” metaphorically.\n\nIn more ways than one, using the telegraph meant writing in code.\n\nThe Morse system of dots and dashes was not called a code at first. It was\njust called an alphabet: “the Morse Telegraphic Alphabet,” typically. But it\nwas not an alphabet. It did not represent sounds by signs. The Morse scheme\ntook the alphabet as a starting point and leveraged it, by substitution,\nreplacing signs with new signs. It was a meta-alphabet, an alphabet once\nremoved. This process—the transferring of meaning from one symbolic level to\nanother—already had a place in mathematics. In a way it was the very essence\nof mathematics. Now it became a familiar part of the human toolkit. Entirely\nbecause of the telegraph, by the late nineteenth century people grew\ncomfortable, or at least familiar, with the idea of codes: signs used for\nother signs, words used for other words. Movement from one symbolic level to\nanother could be called _encoding_.\n\nTwo motivations went hand in glove: secrecy and brevity. Short messages saved\nmoney—that was simple. So powerful was that impulse that English prose style\nsoon seemed to be feeling the effects. _Telegraphic_ and _telegraphese_\ndescribed the new way of writing. Flowers of rhetoric cost too much, and some\nregretted it. “The telegraphic style banishes all the forms of\npoliteness,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1229580) wrote Andrew Wynter:\n\n> > “May I ask you to do me the favour” is 6 _d_. for a distance of 50 miles.\n> How many of those fond adjectives therefore must our poor fellow\n> relentlessly strike out to bring his billet down to a reasonable charge?\n\nAlmost immediately, newspaper reporters began to contrive methods for\ntransmitting more information with fewer billable words. “We early invented a\nshort-hand system, or cipher,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1229815) boasted\none, “so arranged, that the receipts of produce and the sales and prices of\nall leading articles of breadstuffs, provisions, &c., could be sent from\nBuffalo and Albany daily, in twenty words, for both cities, which, when\nwritten out, would make one hundred or more words.” The telegraph companies\ntried to push back, on the grounds that private codes were gaming the system,\nbut ciphers flourished. One typical system assigned dictionary words to whole\nphrases, organizing them semantically and alphabetically. For example, all\nwords starting with B referred to the flour market: baal = “The transactions\nare smaller than yesterday”; babble = “There is a good business doing”; baby =\n“Western is firm, with moderate demand for home trade and export”; button =\n“market quiet and prices easier.” It was necessary, of course, for sender and\nrecipient to work from identical word lists. To the telegraph operators\nthemselves, the encoded messages looked like nonsense, and that, in itself,\nproved an extra virtue.\n\nAs soon as people conceived of sending messages by telegraph, they worried\nthat their communication was exposed to the world—at the very least, to the\ntelegraph operators, unreliable strangers who could not help but read the\nwords they fed through their devices. Compared to handwritten letters, folded\nand sealed with wax, the whole affair seemed public and insecure—the messages\npassing along those mysterious conduits, the electric wires. Vail himself\nwrote in 1847, “The great advantage which this telegraph possesses in\ntransmitting messages with the rapidity of lightning, annihilating time and\nspace, would perhaps be much lessened in its usefulness, could it not avail\nitself of the application of a secret\nalphabet.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1230066) There were, he said,\n“systems”—\n\n> > by which a message may pass between two correspondents, through the medium\n> of the telegraph, and yet the contents of that message remain a profound\n> secret to all others, not excepting the operators of the telegraphic\n> stations, through whose hands it must pass.\n\nThis was all very difficult. The telegraph served not just as a device but as\na _medium_ —a middle, intermediary state. The message passes through this\nmedium. Distinct from the message, one must also consider the contents of that\nmessage. Even when the message must be exposed, the contents could be\nconcealed. Vail explained what he meant by _secret alphabet:_ an alphabet\nwhose characters have been “transposed and interchanged.”\n\n> > Then the representative of _a_ , in the _permanent_ alphabet, may be\n> represented by _y_ , or _c_ , or _x_ , in the _secret_ alphabet; and so of\n> every other letter.\n\nThus, “The firm of G. Barlow & Co. have failed” becomes “Ejn stwz ys & qhwkyf\np iy jhan shtknr.” For less sensitive occasions, Vail proposed using\nabbreviated versions of common phrases. Instead of “give my love to,” he\nsuggested sending “gmlt.” He offered a few more suggestions:\n\n> mhii | My health is improving  \n> ---|---  \n> shf | Stocks have fallen  \n> ymir | Your message is received  \n> wmietg | When may I expect the goods?  \n> wyegfef | Will you exchange gold for eastern funds?  \n  \nAll these systems required prearrangement between sender and recipient: the\nmessage was to be supplemented, or altered, by preexisting knowledge shared at\nboth ends. A convenient repository for this knowledge was a code book, and\nwhen the first Morse line opened for business, one of its key investors and\npromoters, the Maine congressman Francis O. J. Smith, known as Fog, produced\none: _The Secret Corresponding\nVocabulary;[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1230297) adapted for use to Morse’s\nElectro-Magnetic Telegraph: and also in conducting written correspondence,\ntransmitted by the mails, or otherwise_. It was nothing but a numbered,\nalphabetical list of 56,000 English words, _Aaronic_ to _zygodactylous_ , plus\ninstructions. “We will suppose the person writing, and the person written to,\nare each in possession of a copy of this work,” Smith explained. “Instead of\nsending their communications in words, they send numbers only, or partly in\nnumbers, and partly in words.” For greater security, they might agree in\nadvance to add or subtract a private number of their own choosing, or\ndifferent numbers for alternate words. “A few such conventional substitutes,”\nhe promised, “will render the whole language a perfectly dead letter to all\npersons not conusant to the concerted arrangement.”\n\nCryptographers had a mysterious history, their secrets handed along in\nclandestine manuscripts, like the alchemists’. Now code making emerged into\nthe light, exposed in the hardware of commerce, inspiring the popular\nimagination. In the succeeding decades, many other schemes were contrived and\npublished. They ranged from penny pamphlets to volumes of hundreds of pages of\ndensely packed type. From London came E. Erskine Scott’s _Three Letter Code\nfor Condensed Telegraphic and Inscrutably Secret Messages and Correspondence_.\nScott was an actuary and accountant and, like so many in the code business, a\nman evidently driven by an obsession with data. The telegraph opened up a\nworld of possibilities for such people—cataloguers and taxonomists, wordsmiths\nand numerologists, completists of all kinds. Scott’s chapters included not\nonly a vocabulary of common words and two-word combinations, but also\ngeographic names, Christian names, names of all shares quoted on the London\nStock Exchange, all the days in the year, all regiments belonging to the\nBritish army, registries of shipping, and the names of all the peers of the\nrealm. Organizing and numbering all this data made possible a form of\ncompression, too. Shortening messages meant saving money. Customers found that\nthe mere substitution of numbers for words helped little if at all: it cost\njust as much to send “3747” as “azotite.” So code books became phrase books.\nTheir object was a sort of packing of messages into capsules, impenetrable to\nprying eyes and suitable for efficient transmission. And of course, at the\nrecipient’s end, for unpacking.\n\nAn especially successful volume in the 1870s and ’80s was _The A_ _B_ _C\nUniversal Commercial Electric Telegraphic Code_ , devised by William Clauson-\nThue.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1230763) He advertised his code to\n“financiers, merchants, shipowners, brokers, agents, &c.” His motto:\n“Simplicity and Economy Palpable, Secrecy Absolute.” Clauson-Thue, another\ninformation obsessive, tried to arrange the entire language—or at least the\nlanguage of commerce—into phrases, and to organize the phrases by keyword. The\nresult is a peculiar lexicographic achievement, a window into a nation’s\neconomic life, and a trove of odd nuance and unwitting lyricism. For the\nkeyword _panic_ (assigned numbers 10054–10065), the inventory includes:\n\n> A great panic prevails in ———\n>\n> The panic is settling down\n>\n> The panic still continues\n>\n> The worst of the panic is over\n>\n> The panic may be considered over\n\nFor _rain_ (11310–11330):\n\n> Cannot work on account of rain\n>\n> The rain has done much good\n>\n> The rain has done a great amount of damage\n>\n> The rain is now pouring down in good earnest\n>\n> Every prospect of the rain continuing\n>\n> Rain much needed\n>\n> Rain at times\n>\n> Rainfall general\n\nFor _wreck_ (15388–15403):\n\n> Parted from her anchors and became a wreck\n>\n> I think it best to sell the wreck as it lies\n>\n> Every attention will be made to save wreck\n>\n> Must become a total wreck\n>\n> Customs authorities have sold the wreck\n>\n> Consul has engaged men to salve wreck\n\nThe world being full of things as well as words, he endeavored, too, to assign\nnumbers to as many proper names as he could list: names of railways, banks,\nmines, commodities, vessels, ports, and stocks (British, colonial, and\nforeign).\n\nAs the telegraph networks spread under the oceans and across the globe, and\ninternational tariffs ran to many dollars per word, the code books thrived.\nEconomy mattered even more than secrecy. The original trans-Atlantic rate was\nabout one hundred dollars for a message—a “cable,” as it was metonymically\ncalled—of ten words. For not much less, messages could travel between England\nand India, by way of Turkey or Persia and Russia. To save on the tariff,\nclever middlemen devised a practice called “packing.” A packer would collect,\nsay, four messages of five words each and bundle them into a fixed-price\ntelegram of twenty words. The code books got bigger and they got smaller. In\n1885 W. H. Beer & Company in Covent Garden published a popular _Pocket\nTelegraphic Code_ , price one penny, containing “more than 300 one-word\ntelegrams,” neatly organized by subject matter. Essential subjects were\nBetting (“To what amount shall I back for you at present odds?”), Bootmaker\n(“These boots don’t fit, send for them directly”), Washerwoman (“Call for the\nwashing to-day”), and Weather—In Connexion with Voyages (“It is far too rough\nfor you to cross to-day”). And a blank page was provided for “Secret Code.\n(Fill up by arrangement with friends.)” There were specialized codes for\nrailways and yachts and trades from pharmacist to carpetmaker. The grandest\nand most expensive code books borrowed freely from one another. “It has been\nbrought to the Author’s knowledge that some persons have purchased a single\ncopy of the ‘A B C Telegraphic Code’ for service in compiling Codes of their\nown,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1231128) complained Clauson-Thue. “The\nAuthor would intimate that such an operation is a breach of the Copyright Act,\nand liable to become a matter of legal and unpleasant procedure.” This was\njust bluster. By the turn of the century, the world’s telegraphers, through\nthe medium of International Telegraphic Conferences held in Berne and in\nLondon, had systematized codes with words in English, Dutch, French, German,\nItalian, Latin, Portuguese, and Spanish. The code books prospered and expanded\nthrough the first decades of the twentieth century and then vanished into\nobscurity.\n\nThose who used the telegraph codes slowly discovered an unanticipated side\neffect of their efficiency and brevity. They were perilously vulnerable to the\nsmallest errors. Because they lacked the natural redundancy of English\nprose—even the foreshortened prose of telegraphese—these cleverly encoded\nmessages could be disrupted by a mistake in a single character. By a single\ndot, for that matter. For example, on June 16, 1887, a Philadelphia wool\ndealer named Frank Primrose telegraphed his agent in Kansas to say that he had\n_bought_ —abbreviated in their agreed code as _BAY_ —500,000 pounds of wool.\nWhen the message arrived, the key word had become _BUY_. The agent began\nbuying wool, and before long the error cost Primrose $20,000, according to the\nlawsuit he filed against the Western Union Telegraph Company. The legal battle\ndragged on for six years, until finally the Supreme Court upheld the fine\nprint on the back of the telegraph blank, which spelled out a procedure for\nprotecting against errors:\n\n> > To guard against mistakes or delays, the sender of a message should order\n> it REPEATED; that is telegraphed back to the originating office for\n> comparison.… Said company shall not be liable for mistakes in … any\n> UNREPEATED message … nor in any case for errors in cipher or obscure\n> messages.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1231336)\n\nThe telegraph company had to tolerate ciphers but did not have to like them.\nThe court found in favor of Primrose in the amount of $1.15, the price of\nsending the telegram.\n\nSecret writing was as old as writing. When writing began, it was in itself\nsecret to all but the few. As the mystery dissolved, people found new ways to\nkeep their words privileged and recondite. They rearranged words into\nanagrams. They reversed their script in the mirror. They invented ciphers.\n\nIn 1641, just as the English Civil War began, an anonymous little book\ncatalogued the many known methods of what it called “cryptographia.” These\nincluded special paper and ink:[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1231675) the\njuice of lemons or onions, raw egg, or “the distilled Juice of Gloworms,”\nwhich might or might not be visible in the dark. Alternatively, writing could\nbe obscured by substituting letters for other letters, or inventing new\nsymbols, or writing from right to left, or “transposing each Letter, according\nto some unusual Order, as, suppose the first Letter should be at the latter\nEnd of the Line, the second at the Beginning, or the like.” Or a message could\nbe written across two lines:\n\n> T e o l i r a e l m s f m s e s p l u o w e u t e l\n>\n> h s u d e s r a l o t a i h d, u p y s r e m s y i d\n\n> _The Souldiers are allmost famished, supply us or wee must yeild_.\n\nThrough transposition and substitution of letters, the Romans and the Jews had\ndevised other methods, more intricate and thus more obscure.\n\nThis little book was titled _Mercury: or the Secret and Swift Messenger.\nShewing, How a Man may with Privacy and Speed communicate his Thoughts to a\nFriend at any Distance_. The author eventually revealed himself as John\nWilkins, a vicar and mathematician, later to become master of Trinity College,\nCambridge, and a founder of the Royal Society. “He was a very ingenious man\nand had a very mechanical head,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1232083) one\ncontemporary said. “One of much and deep thinking,… lusty, strong grown, well\nset, broad shouldered.” He was also thorough. If he could not mention every\ncipher tried since ancient times, he nonetheless included all that could have\nbeen known to a scholar in seventeenth-century England. He surveyed secret\nwriting both as a primer and a compendium.\n\nFor Wilkins the issues of cryptography stood near the fundamental problem of\ncommunication. He considered writing and secret writing as essentially the\nsame. Leaving secrecy aside, he expressed the problem this way: “How a Man may\nwith the greatest Swiftness and Speed, discover his Intentions to one that is\nfar distant from him.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1232358) By _swiftness_\nand _speed_ he meant, in 1641, something philosophical; the birth of Isaac\nNewton was a year away. “There is nothing (we say) so swift as Thought,” he\nnoted. Next to thought, the swiftest action seemed to be that of sight. As a\nclergyman, he observed that the swiftest motion of all must belong to angels\nand spirits. If only a man could send an angel on an errand, he could dispatch\nbusiness at any distance. The rest of us, stuck with Organical Bodies, “cannot\ncommunicate their Thoughts so easie and immediate a way.” No wonder, Wilkins\nwrote, that angels are called messengers.\n\nAs a mathematician, he considered the problem from another side. He set out to\ndetermine how a restricted set of symbols—perhaps just two, three, or\nfive—might be made to stand for a whole alphabet. They would have to be used\nin combination. For example, a set of five symbols—a, b, c, d, e—used in pairs\ncould replace an alphabet of twenty-five letters:\n\n![](images/00033.jpg)\n\n“According to which,” wrote Wilkins, “these words, _I am betrayed_ , may be\nthus described: _Bd aacb abaedddbaaecaead_.” So even a small symbol set could\nbe arranged to express any message at all. However, with a small symbol set, a\ngiven message requires a longer string of characters—“more Labour and Time,”\nhe wrote. Wilkins did not explain that 25 = 52, nor that three symbols taken\nin threes (aaa, aab, aac,…) produce twenty-seven possibilities because 33 =\n27. But he clearly understood the underlying mathematics. His last example was\na binary code, awkward though this was to express in words:\n\n> > Two Letters of the Alphabet being transposed through five Places, will\n> yield thirty two Differences, and so will more than serve for the Four and\n> twenty Letters; unto which they may be thus applied.\n\n![](images/00034.jpg)\n\nTwo symbols. In groups of five. “Yield thirty two Differences.”\n\nThat word, _differences_ , must have struck Wilkins’s readers (few though they\nwere) as an odd choice. But it was deliberate and pregnant with meaning.\nWilkins was reaching for a conception of information in its purest, most\ngeneral form. Writing was only a special case: “For in the general we must\nnote, That _whatever is capable of a competent Difference, perceptible to any\nSense, may be a sufficient Means whereby to express the\nCogitations_.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1232615) A difference could be\n“two Bells of different Notes”; or “any Object of Sight, whether Flame, Smoak,\n&c.”; or trumpets, cannons, or drums. Any difference meant a binary choice.\nAny binary choice began the expressing of cogitations. Here, in this arcane\nand anonymous treatise of 1641, the essential idea of information theory poked\nto the surface of human thought, saw its shadow, and disappeared again for\nfour hundred years.\n\nThe contribution of the dilettantes is what the historian of cryptography\nDavid Kahn calls the excited era triggered by the advent of the\ntelegraph.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1232825) A new public interest in\nciphers arose just as the subject bloomed in certain intellectual circles.\nAncient methods of secret writing appealed to an odd assortment of people,\npuzzle makers and game players, mathematically or poetically inclined. They\nanalyzed ancient methods of secret writing and invented new ones. Theorists\ndebated who should prevail, the best code maker or the best code breaker. The\ngreat American popularizer of cryptography was Edgar Allan Poe. In his\nfantastic tales and magazine essays he publicized the ancient art and boasted\nof his own skill as a practitioner. “We can scarcely imagine a time when there\ndid not exist a necessity, or at least a\ndesire,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1233105) he wrote in _Graham’s\nMagazine_ in 1841, “of transmitting information from one individual to\nanother, in such manner as to elude general comprehension.” For Poe, code\nmaking was more than just a historical or technical enthusiasm; it was an\nobsession. It reflected his sense of how we communicate our selves to the\nworld. Code makers and writers are trafficking in the same goods. “The soul is\na cypher, in the sense of a cryptograph; and the shorter a cryptograph is, the\nmore difficulty there is in\ncomprehension,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1233462) he wrote. Secrecy was\nin Poe’s nature; he preferred mystery to transparency.\n\n“Secret intercommunication must have existed almost contemporaneously with the\ninvention of letters,” he declared. This was for Poe a bridge between science\nand the occult, between the rational mind and the\nsavant.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1233724) To analyze cryptography—“a\nserious thing, as the means of imparting information”—required a special form\nof mental power, a penetrating mind, and might well be taught in academies. He\nsaid again and again that “a peculiar mental action is called into play.” He\npublished as challenges to his readers a series of substitution ciphers.\n\nAlong with Poe, Jules Verne and Honoré de Balzac also introduced ciphers into\ntheir fiction. In 1868, Lewis Carroll had a card printed on two sides with\nwhat he called “The Telegraph-Cipher,” which employed a “key-alphabet” and a\n“message-alphabet,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1234115) to be transposed\naccording to a secret word agreed on by the correspondents and carried in\ntheir memories. But the most advanced cryptanalyst in Victorian England was\nCharles Babbage. The process of substituting symbols, crossing levels of\nmeaning, lay near the heart of so many issues. And he enjoyed the challenge.\n“One of the most singular characteristics of the art of deciphering,” he\nasserted, “is the strong conviction possessed by every person, even moderately\nacquainted with it, that he is able to construct a cipher which nobody else\ncan decipher. I have also observed that the cleverer the person, the more\nintimate is his conviction.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1234438) He\nbelieved that himself, at first, but later switched to the side of the code\nbreakers. He planned an authoritative work to be known as _The Philosophy of\nDecyphering_ but never managed to complete it. He did solve, among others, a\npolyalphabetic cipher known as the Vigenère, _le chiffre indéchiffrable_ ,\nthought to be the most secure in\nEurope.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1234758) As in his other work, he\napplied algebraic methods, expressing cryptanalysis in the form of equations.\nEven so, he remained a dilettante and knew it.\n\nWhen Babbage attacked cryptography with a calculus, he was employing the same\ntools he had explored more conventionally in their home, mathematics, and less\nconventionally in the realm of machinery, where he created a symbolism for the\nmoving parts of gears and levers and switches. Dionysius Lardner had said of\nthe mechanical notation, “The various parts of the machinery being once\nexpressed on paper by proper symbols, the enquirer dismisses altogether from\nhis thoughts the mechanism itself and attends only to the symbols … an almost\nmetaphysical system of abstract signs, by which the motion of the hand\nperforms the office of the mind.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1235056) Two\nyounger Englishmen, Augustus De Morgan and George Boole, turned the same\nmethodology to work on an even more abstract material: the propositions of\nlogic. De Morgan was Babbage’s friend and Ada Byron’s tutor and a professor at\nUniversity College, London. Boole was the son of a Lincolnshire cobbler and a\nlady’s maid and became, by the 1840s, a professor at Queen’s College, Cork. In\n1847 they published separately and simultaneously books that amounted to the\ngreatest milestone in the development of logic since Aristotle: Boole’s\n_Mathematical Analysis of Logic, Being an Essay Towards a Calculus of\nDeductive Reasoning_ , and De Morgan’s _Formal Logic: or, the Calculus of\nInference, Necessary and Probable_. The subject, esoteric as it was, had\nstagnated for centuries.\n\nDe Morgan knew more about the scholastic traditions of the subject, but Boole\nwas the more original and free-thinking mathematician. By post, for years,\nthey exchanged ideas about converting language, or truth, into algebraic\nsymbols. _X_ could mean “cow” and _Y_ “horse.” That might be one cow, or a\nmember of the set of all cows. (The same?) In the algebraic fashion the\nsymbols were to be manipulated. _XY_ could be “name of everything which is\n_both X_ and _Y_ ” while _X,Y_ stood in for “name of everything which is\neither _X_ or _Y_.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1235369) Simple enough—but\nlanguage is not simple and complications reared up. “Now some _Z_ s are not\n_X_ s, the _ZY_ s,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1235885) wrote De Morgan at\none point. “But they are _nonexistent_. You may say that _nonexistents_ are\nnot _X_ s. A nonexistent horse is not even a horse; and (_a fortiori_?) not a\ncow.”\n\nHe added wistfully, “I do not despair of seeing you give meaning to this new\nkind of negative quantity.” He did not post this and he did not throw it away.\n\nBoole thought of his system as a mathematics without numbers. “It is simply a\nfact,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1236258) he wrote, “that the ultimate\nlaws of logic—those alone on which it is possible to construct a science of\nlogic—are mathematical in their form and expression, although not belonging to\nthe mathematics of quantity.” The only numbers allowed, he proposed, were zero\nand one. It was all or nothing: “The respective interpretation of the symbols\n0 and 1 in the system of logic are _Nothing_ and\n_Universe_.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1236667) Until now logic had\nbelonged to philosophy. Boole was claiming possession on behalf of\nmathematics. In doing so, he devised a new form of encoding. Its code book\npaired two types of symbolism, each abstracted far from the world of things.\nOn one side was a set of characters drawn from the formalism of mathematics:\n_p_ ’s and _q_ ’s, +’s and –’s, braces and brackets. On the other were\noperations, propositions, relations ordinarily expressed in the fuzzy and\nmutable speech of everyday life: words about truth and falsity, membership in\nclasses, premises and conclusions. There were “particles”: _if_ , _either_ ,\n_or_. These were the elements of Boole’s credo:\n\n> > That Language is an instrument of human reason, and not merely a medium\n> for the expression of thought.\n>\n\n>> The elements of which all language consists are signs or symbols.\n\n>\n\n>> Words are signs. Sometimes they are said to represent things; sometimes the\noperations by which the mind combines together the simple notions of things\ninto complex conceptions.\n\n>\n\n>> Words … are not the only signs which we are capable of employing. Arbitrary\nmarks, which speak only to the eye, and arbitrary sounds or actions … are\nequally of the nature of signs.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1237045)\n\nThe encoding, the conversion from one modality to the other, served a purpose.\nIn the case of Morse code, the purpose was to turn everyday language into a\nform suitable for near-instantaneous transmission across miles of copper wire.\nIn the case of symbolic logic, the new form was suitable for manipulation by a\ncalculus. The symbols were like little capsules, protecting their delicate\ncargo from the wind and fog of everyday communication. How much safer to\nwrite:\n\n> 1 − _x_ = _y_(1 − _z_) + _z_(1 − _y_) + (1 − _y_)(1 − _z_)\n\nthan the real-language proposition for which, in a typical Boolean example, it\nstood:\n\n> > _Unclean beasts are all which divide the hoof without chewing the cud, all\n> which chew the cud without dividing the hoof, and all which neither divide\n> the hoof nor chew the cud_.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1237257)\n\nThe safety came in no small part from draining the words of meaning. Signs and\nsymbols were not just placeholders; they were operators, like the gears and\nlevers in a machine. Language, after all, is an instrument.\n\nIt was seen distinctly now as an instrument with two separate functions:\nexpression and thought. Thinking came first, or so people assumed. To Boole,\nlogic _was_ thought—polished and purified. He chose _The Lawsof Thought_ as\nthe title for his 1854 masterwork. Not coincidentally, the telegraphists also\nfelt they were generating insight into messaging within the brain. “A word is\na tool for thinking, before the thinker uses it as a signal for communicating\nhis thought,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1237435) asserted an essayist in\n_Harper’s New Monthly Magazine_ in 1873.\n\n> > Perhaps the most extended and important influence which the telegraph is\n> destined to exert upon the human mind is that which it will ultimately work\n> out through its influence on language.… By the principle which Darwin\n> describes as natural selection short words are gaining the advantage over\n> long words, direct forms of expression are gaining the advantage over\n> indirect, words of precise meaning the advantage of the ambiguous, and local\n> idioms are everywhere at a disadvantage.\n\nBoole’s influence was subtle and slow. He corresponded only briefly with\nBabbage; they never met. One of his champions was Lewis Carroll, who, at the\nvery end of his life, a quarter century after _Alice in Wonderland_ , wrote\ntwo volumes of instruction, puzzles, diagrams, and exercises in symbolic\nlogic. Although his symbolism was impeccable, his syllogisms ran toward\nwhimsy:\n\n> (1) Babies are illogical;\n>\n> (2) Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile;\n>\n> (3) Illogical persons are despised.\n>\n> (Concl.) Babies cannot manage\n> crocodiles.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1237692)\n\nThe symbolic version—![](images/00035.jpg), i.e. ![](images/00036.jpg)—having\nbeen suitably drained of meaning, allowed the user to reach the desired\nconclusion without tripping over awkward intermediate propositions along the\nlines of “babies are despised.”\n\nAs the century turned, Bertrand Russell paid George Boole an extraordinary\ncompliment: “Pure mathematics was discovered by Boole, in a work which he\ncalled the _Laws of Thought_.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1238072) It has\nbeen quoted often. What makes the compliment extraordinary is the seldom\nquoted disparagement that follows on its heels:\n\n> > He was also mistaken in supposing that he was dealing with the laws of\n> thought: the question how people actually think was quite irrelevant to him,\n> and if his book had really contained the laws of thought, it was curious\n> that no one should ever have thought in such a way before.\n\nOne might almost think Russell enjoyed paradoxes.\n\n* * *\n\n* But Count Miot de Melito claimed in his memoirs that Chappe submitted his idea to the War Office with the name tachygraphe (“swift writer”) and that he, Miot, proposed télégraphe instead—which “has become, so to speak, a household word.”\n\n\n# 6 | NEW WIRES, NEW LOGIC\n\n\n##\n\n> (No Other Thing Is More Enswathed in the Unknown)\n\n> _The perfect symmetry of the whole apparatus—the wire in the middle, the two\n> telephones at the ends of the wire, and the two gossips at the ends of the\n> telephones—may be very fascinating to a mere mathematician._\n\n> —James Clerk Maxwell (1878)[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1238461)\n\nA CURIOUS CHILD IN A COUNTRY TOWN in the 1920s might naturally form an\ninterest in the sending of messages along wires, as Claude Shannon did in\nGaylord, Michigan. He saw wires every day, fencing the pastures—double strands\nof steel, twisted and barbed, stretched from post to post. He scrounged what\nparts he could and jerry-rigged his own barbed-wire telegraph, tapping\nmessages to another boy a half mile away. He used the code devised by Samuel\nF. B. Morse. That suited him. He liked the very idea of codes—not just secret\ncodes, but codes in the more general sense, words or symbols standing in for\nother words or symbols. He was an inventive and playful spirit. The child\nstayed with the man. All his life, he played games and invented games. He was\na gadgeteer. The grown-up Shannon juggled and devised theories about juggling.\nWhen researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Bell\nLaboratories had to leap aside to let a unicycle pass, that was Shannon. He\nhad more than his share of playfulness, and as a child he had a large portion\nof loneliness, too, which along with his tinkerer’s ingenuity helped motivate\nhis barbed-wire telegraph.\n\nGaylord amounted to little more than a few streets and stores interrupting the\nbroad northern farmland of the Michigan\npeninsula.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1238974) Here and onward across the\nplains and prairie to the Rocky Mountains barbed wire had spread like a vine,\nbegetting industrial fortunes though it was not a particularly glamorous\ntechnology amid the excitement of what was already called the Age of\nElectricity. Beginning in 1874, when an Illinois farmer received U. S. Patent\nNo. 157,124 for “a new and valuable Improvement in Wire-Fences,” battles for\nownership raged, ultimately reaching the Supreme Court, while the wire defined\nterritory and closed the open range. At the peak, American farmers, ranchers,\nand railroads laid more than a million miles a year. Taken collectively the\nnation’s fence wire formed no web or network, just a broken lattice. Its\npurpose had been to separate, not to connect. For electricity it made a poor\nconductor even in dry weather. But wire was wire, and Claude Shannon was not\nthe first to see this wide-ranging lattice as a potential communications grid.\nThousands of farmers in remote places had the same idea. Unwilling to wait for\nthe telephone companies to venture out from the cities, rural folk formed\nbarbed-wire telephone cooperatives. They replaced metal staples with insulated\nfasteners. They attached dry batteries and speaking tubes and added spare wire\nto bridge the gaps. In the summer of 1895 _The New York Times_ reported:\n“There can be no doubt that many rough-and-ready utilizations of the telephone\nare now being made. For instance, a number of South Dakota farmers have helped\nthemselves to a telephone system covering eight miles of wire by supplying\nthemselves with transmitters and making connections with the barb wire which\nconstitutes the fence in that part of the country.” The reporter observed:\n“The idea is gaining ground that the day of cheap telephones for the million\nis at hand. Whether this impression is soundly based is an open\nquestion.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1239435) Clearly people wanted the\nconnections. Cattlemen who despised fences for making parcels of the free\nrange now hooked up their speaking tubes to hear market quotations, weather\nreports, or just, crackling along the wires, the attenuated simulacrum of the\nhuman voice, a thrill in itself.\n\nThree great waves of electrical communication crested in sequence: telegraphy,\ntelephony, and radio. People began to feel that it was natural to possess\nmachines dedicated to the sending and receiving of messages. These devices\nchanged the topology—ripped the social fabric and reconnected it, added\ngateways and junctions where there had only been blank distance. Already at\nthe turn of the twentieth century there was worry about unanticipated effects\non social behavior. The superintendent of the line in Wisconsin fretted about\nyoung men and women “constantly sparking over the wire” between Eau Claire and\nChippewa Falls. “This free use of the line for flirtation purposes has grown\nto an alarming extent,” he wrote, “and if it is to go on somebody must pay for\nit.” The Bell companies tried to discourage frivolous telephony, particularly\nby women and servants. A freer spirit prevailed at the farmer cooperatives,\nwhich avoided paying the telephone companies well into the 1920s. The Montana\nEast Line Telephone Association—eight members—sent “up to the minute” news\nreports around its network, because the men also owned a\nradio.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1239692) Children wanted to play this\ngame, too.\n\nClaude Elwood Shannon, born in 1916, was given the full name of his father, a\nself-made businessman—furniture, undertaking, and real estate—and probate\njudge, already well into middle age. Claude’s grandfather, a farmer, had\ninvented a machine for washing clothes: a waterproof tub, a wooden arm, and a\nplunger. Claude’s mother, Mabel Catherine Wolf, daughter of German immigrants,\nworked as a language teacher and sometime principal of the high school. His\nolder sister, Catherine Wolf Shannon (the parents doled out names\nparsimoniously), studied mathematics and regularly entertained Claude with\npuzzles. They lived on Center Street a few blocks north of Main Street. The\ntown of Gaylord boasted barely three thousand souls, but this was enough to\nsupport a band with Teutonic uniforms and shiny instruments, and in grade\nschool Claude played an E-flat alto horn broader than his chest. He had\nErector Sets and books. He made model planes and earned money delivering\ntelegrams for the local Western Union office. He solved cryptograms. Left on\nhis own, he read and reread books; a story he loved was Edgar Allan Poe’s “The\nGold-Bug,” set on a remote southern island, featuring a peculiar William\nLegrand, a man with an “excitable brain” and “unusual powers of mind” but\n“subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and\nmelancholy”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1239950)—in other words, a version\nof his creator. Such ingenious protagonists were required by the times and\nduly conjured by Poe and other prescient writers, like Arthur Conan Doyle and\nH. G. Wells. The hero of “The Gold-Bug” finds buried treasure by deciphering a\ncryptograph written on parchment. Poe spells out the string of numerals and\nsymbols (“rudely traced, in a red tint, between the death’s-head and the\ngoat”)—53‡‡†305) )6* ;4826)4‡.)4‡) ;806* ;48†8¶60) )85;1‡( ;:‡*8†83(88) 5*‡\n;46(;88*96*?;8) *‡(;485) ;5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*–4) 8§8* ;4069285) ;)6†8)4‡‡;1\n(‡9;48081 ;8:8‡1 ;48†85;4)485†528806*81 (‡9:48;(88;4 (‡?34;48)4‡;161;:188;\n‡?;—and walks the reader through every twist of its construction and\ndeconstruction. “Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to\ntake interest in such riddles,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1240200) his\ndark hero proclaims, thrilling a reader who might have the same bias of mind.\nThe solution leads to the gold, but no one cares about the gold, really. The\nthrill is in the code: mystery and transmutation.\n\nClaude finished Gaylord High School in three years instead of four and went on\nin 1932 to the University of Michigan, where he studied electrical engineering\nand mathematics. Just before graduating, in 1936, he saw a postcard on a\nbulletin board advertising a graduate-student job at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology. Vannevar Bush, then the dean of engineering, was\nlooking for a research assistant to run a new machine with a peculiar name:\nthe Differential Analyzer. This was a 100-ton iron platform of rotating shafts\nand gears. In the newspapers it was being called a “mechanical brain” or\n“thinking machine”; a typical headline declared:\n\n“Thinking Machine” Does Higher Mathematics;  \nSolves Equations That Take Humans\nMonths[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1240396)\n\nCharles Babbage’s Difference Engine and Analytical Engine loomed as ancestral\nghosts, but despite the echoes of nomenclature and the similarity of purpose,\nthe Differential Analyzer owed virtually nothing to Babbage. Bush had barely\nheard of him. Bush, like Babbage, hated the numbing, wasteful labor of mere\ncalculation. “A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures;\noften he cannot,” Bush wrote. “He is primarily an individual who is skilled in\nthe use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of\nintuitive judgment.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1240650)\n\nMIT in the years after World War I was one of the nation’s three focal points\nfor the burgeoning practical science of electrical engineering, along with the\nBell Telephone Laboratories and General Electric. It was also a place with a\nvoracious need for the solving of equations—especially differential equations,\nand particularly differential equations of the second order. Differential\nequations express rates of change, as in ballistic projectiles and oscillating\nelectric currents. Second-order differential equations concern rates of change\nin rates of change: from position to velocity to acceleration. They are hard\nto solve analytically, and they pop up everywhere. Bush designed his machine\nto handle this entire class of problems and thus the whole range of physical\nsystems that generated them. Like Babbage’s machines, it was essentially\nmechanical, though it used electric motors to drive the weighty apparatus and,\nas it evolved, more and more electromechanical switches to control it.\n\nUnlike Babbage’s machine, it did not manipulate numbers. It worked on\nquantities—generating curves, as Bush liked to say, to represent the future of\na dynamical system. We would say now that it was analog rather than digital.\nIts wheels and disks were arranged to produce a physical analog of the\ndifferential equations. In a way it was a monstrous descendant of the\nplanimeter, a little measuring contraption that translated the integration of\ncurves into the motion of a wheel. Professors and students came to the\nDifferential Analyzer as supplicants, and when it could solve their equations\nwith 2 percent accuracy, the operator, Claude Shannon, was happy. In any case\nhe was utterly captivated by this “computer,” and not just by the grinding,\nrasping, room-filling analog part, but by the nearly silent (save for the\noccasional click and tap) electrical\ncontrols.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1240905)\n\n![](images/00037.jpg)\n\nTHE DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER OF VANNEVAR BUSH AT MIT [(Illustration credit\n6.1)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1934414)\n\nThese were of two kinds: ordinary switches and the special switches called\nrelays—the telegraph’s progeny. The relay was an electrical switch controlled\nby electricity (a looping idea). For the telegraph, the point was to reach\nacross long distances by making a chain. For Shannon, the point was not\ndistance but control. A hundred relays, intricately interconnected, switching\non and off in particular sequence, coordinated the Differential Analyzer. The\nbest experts on complex relay circuits were telephone engineers; relays\ncontrolled the routing of calls through telephone exchanges, as well as\nmachinery on factory assembly lines. Relay circuitry was designed for each\nparticular case. No one had thought to study the idea systematically, but\nShannon was looking for a topic for his master’s thesis, and he saw a\npossibility. In his last year of college he had taken a course in symbolic\nlogic, and, when he tried to make an orderly list of the possible arrangements\nof switching circuits, he had a sudden feeling of déjà vu. In a deeply\nabstract way, these problems lined up. The peculiar artificial notation of\nsymbolic logic, Boole’s “algebra,” could be used to describe circuits.\n\nThis was an odd connection to make. The worlds of electricity and logic seemed\nincongruous. Yet, as Shannon realized, what a relay passes onward from one\ncircuit to the next is not really electricity but rather a fact: the fact of\nwhether the circuit is open or closed. If a circuit is open, then a relay may\ncause the next circuit to open. But the reverse arrangement is also possible,\nthe negative arrangement: when a circuit is open, a relay may cause the next\ncircuit to close. It was clumsy to describe the possibilities with words;\nsimpler to reduce them to symbols, and natural, for a mathematician, to\nmanipulate the symbols in equations. (Charles Babbage had taken steps down the\nsame path with his mechanical notation, though Shannon knew nothing of this.)\n\n“A calculus is developed for manipulating these equations by simple\nmathematical processes”—with this clarion call, Shannon began his thesis in\n1937. So far the equations just represented combinations of circuits. Then,\n“the calculus is shown to be exactly analogous to the calculus of propositions\nused in the symbolic study of logic.” Like Boole, Shannon showed that he\nneeded only two numbers for his equations: zero and one. Zero represented a\nclosed circuit; one represented an open circuit. On or off. Yes or no. True or\nfalse. Shannon pursued the consequences. He began with simple cases: two-\nswitch circuits, in series or in parallel. Circuits in series, he noted,\ncorresponded to the logical connective _and;_ whereas circuits in parallel had\nthe effect of _or_. An operation of logic that could be matched electrically\nwas negation, converting a value into its opposite. As in logic, he saw that\ncircuitry could make “if … then” choices. Before he was done, he had analyzed\n“star” and “mesh” networks of increasing complexity, by setting down\npostulates and theorems to handle systems of simultaneous equations. He\nfollowed this tower of abstraction with practical examples—inventions, on\npaper, some practical and some just quirky. He diagrammed the design of an\nelectric combination lock, to be made from five push-button switches. He laid\nout a circuit that would “automatically add two numbers, using only relays and\nswitches”;[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1241169) for convenience, he\nsuggested arithmetic using base two. “It is possible to perform complex\nmathematical operations by means of relay circuits,” he wrote. “In fact, any\noperation that can be completely described in a finite number of steps using\nthe words _if_ , _or_ , _and_ , etc. can be done automatically with relays.”\nAs a topic for a student in electrical engineering this was unheard of: a\ntypical thesis concerned refinements to electric motors or transmission lines.\nThere was no practical call for a machine that could solve puzzles of logic,\nbut it pointed to the future. Logic circuits. Binary arithmetic. Here in a\nmaster’s thesis by a research assistant was the essence of the computer\nrevolution yet to come.\n\nShannon spent a summer working at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York\nCity and then, at Vannevar Bush’s suggestion, switched from electrical\nengineering to mathematics at MIT. Bush also suggested that he look into the\npossibility of applying an algebra of symbols—his “queer\nalgebra”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1241525)—to the nascent science of\ngenetics, whose basic elements, genes and chromosomes, were just dimly\nunderstood. So Shannon began work on an ambitious doctoral dissertation to be\ncalled “An Algebra for Theoretical\nGenetics.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1241777) Genes, as he noted, were a\ntheoretical construct. They were thought to be carried in the rodlike bodies\nknown as chromosomes, which could be seen under a microscope, but no one knew\nexactly how genes were structured or even if they were real. “Still,” as\nShannon noted, “it is possible for our purposes to act as though they were.…\nWe shall speak therefore as though the genes actually exist and as though our\nsimple representation of hereditary phenomena were really true, since so far\nas we are concerned, this might just as well be so.” He devised an arrangement\nof letters and numbers to represent “genetic formulas” for an individual; for\nexample, two chromosome pairs and four gene positions could be represented\nthus:\n\n> A1B2C3D5 E4F1G6H1\n>\n> A3B1C4D3 E4F2G6H2\n\nThen, the processes of genetic combination and cross-breeding could be\npredicted by a calculus of additions and multiplications. It was a sort of\nroad map, far abstracted from the messy biological reality. He explained: “To\nnon-mathematicians we point out that it is a commonplace of modern algebra for\nsymbols to represent concepts other than numbers.” The result was complex,\noriginal, and quite detached from anything people in the field were\ndoing.*[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1242005) He never bothered to publish\nit.\n\nMeanwhile, late in the winter of 1939, he wrote Bush a long letter about an\nidea closer to his heart:\n\n> > Off and on I have been working on an analysis of some of the fundamental\n> properties of general systems for the transmission of intellegence,\n> including telephony, radio, television, telegraphy, etc. Practically all\n> systems of communication may be thrown into the following general\n> form:[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1242174)\n\n![](images/00038.jpg)\n\n_T_ and _R_ were a transmitter and a receiver. They mediated three “functions\nof time,” _f_(_t_): the “intelligence to be transmitted,” the signal, and the\nfinal output, which, of course, was meant to be as nearly identical to the\ninput as possible. (“In an ideal system it would be an exact replica.”) The\nproblem, as Shannon saw it, was that real systems always suffer _distortion_\n—a term for which he proposed to give a rigorous definition in mathematical\nform. There was also _noise_ (“e.g., static”). Shannon told Bush he was trying\nto prove some theorems. Also, and not incidentally, he was working on a\nmachine for performing symbolic mathematical operations, to do the work of the\nDifferential Analyzer and more, entirely by means of electric circuits. He had\nfar to go. “Although I have made some progress in various outskirts of the\nproblem I am still pretty much in the woods, as far as actual results are\nconcerned,” he said.\n\n> > I have a set of circuits drawn up which actually will perform symbolic\n> differentiation and integration on most functions, but the method is not\n> quite general or natural enough to be perfectly satisfactory. Some of the\n> general philosophy underlying the machine seems to evade me completely.\n\nHe was painfully thin, almost gaunt. His ears stuck out a little from his\nclose-trimmed wavy hair. In the fall of 1939, at a party in the Garden Street\napartment he shared with two roommates, he was standing shyly in his own\ndoorway, a jazz record playing on the phonograph, when a young woman started\nthrowing popcorn at him. She was Norma Levor, an adventurous nineteen-year-old\nRadcliffe student from New York. She had left school to live in Paris that\nsummer but returned when Nazi Germany invaded Poland; even at home, the\nlooming war had begun to unsettle people’s lives. Claude struck her as dark in\ntemperament and sparkling in intellect. They began to see each other every\nday; he wrote sonnets for her, uncapitalized in the style of E. E. Cummings.\nShe loved the way he loved words, the way he said _Boooooooolean_ algebra. By\nJanuary they were married (Boston judge, no ceremony), and she followed him to\nPrinceton, where he had received a postdoctoral fellowship.\n\nThe invention of writing had catalyzed logic, by making it possible to reason\nabout reasoning—to hold a train of thought up before the eyes for\nexamination—and now, all these centuries later, logic was reanimated with the\ninvention of machinery that could work upon symbols. In logic and mathematics,\nthe highest forms of reasoning, everything seemed to be coming together.\n\nBy melding logic and mathematics in a system of axioms, signs, formulas, and\nproofs, philosophers seemed within reach of a kind of perfection—a rigorous,\nformal certainty. This was the goal of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North\nWhitehead, the giants of English rationalism, who published their great work\nin three volumes from 1910 to 1913. Their title, _Principia Mathematica_ ,\ngrandly echoed Isaac Newton; their ambition was nothing less than the\nperfection of all mathematics. This was finally possible, they claimed,\nthrough the instrument of symbolic logic, with its obsidian signs and\nimplacable rules. Their mission was to prove every mathematical fact. The\nprocess of proof, when carried out properly, should be mechanical. In contrast\nto words, _symbolism_ (they declared) enables “perfectly precise expression.”\nThis elusive quarry had been pursued by Boole, and before him, Babbage, and\nlong before either of them, Leibniz, all believing that the perfection of\nreasoning could come with the perfect encoding of thought. Leibniz could only\nimagine it: “a certain script of language,” he wrote in 1678, “that perfectly\nrepresents the relationships between our\nthoughts.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1242466) With such encoding, logical\nfalsehoods would be instantly exposed.\n\n> > The characters would be quite different from what has been imagined up to\n> now.… The characters of this script should serve invention and judgment as\n> in algebra and arithmetic.… It will be impossible to write, using these\n> characters, chimerical notions [_chimères_].\n\nRussell and Whitehead explained that symbolism suits the “highly abstract\nprocesses and ideas”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1242791) used in logic,\nwith its trains of reasoning. Ordinary language works better for the muck and\nmire of the ordinary world. A statement like _a whale is big_ uses simple\nwords to express “a complicated fact,” they observed, whereas _one is a\nnumber_ “leads, in language, to an intolerable prolixity.” Understanding\nwhales, and bigness, requires knowledge and experience of real things, but to\nmanage _1_ , and _number_ , and all their associated arithmetical operations,\nwhen properly expressed in desiccated symbols, should be automatic.\n\nThey had noticed some bumps along the way, though—some of the _chimères_ that\nshould have been impossible. “A very large part of the labour,” they said in\ntheir preface, “has been expended on the contradictions and paradoxes which\nhave infected logic.” “Infected” was a strong word but barely adequate to\nexpress the agony of the paradoxes. They were a cancer.\n\nSome had been known since ancient times:\n\n> > Epimenides the Cretan said that all Cretans were liars, and all other\n> statements made by Cretans were certainly lies. Was this a\n> lie?[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1243105)\n\nA cleaner formulation of Epimenides’ paradox—cleaner because one need not\nworry about Cretans and their attributes—is the liar’s paradox: _This\nstatement is false_. The statement cannot be true, because then it is false.\nIt cannot be false, because then it becomes true. It is neither true nor\nfalse, or it is both at once. But the discovery of this twisting, backfiring,\nmind-bending circularity does not bring life or language crashing to a\nhalt—one grasps the idea and moves on—because life and language lack the\nperfection, the absolutes, that give them force. In real life, all Cretans\ncannot be liars. Even liars often tell the truth. The pain begins only with\nthe attempt to build an airtight vessel. Russell and Whitehead aimed for\nperfection—for proof—otherwise the enterprise had little point. The more\nrigorously they built, the more paradoxes they found. “It was in the air,”\nDouglas Hofstadter has written, “that truly peculiar things could happen when\nmodern cousins of various ancient paradoxes cropped up inside the rigorously\nlogical world of numbers,… a pristine paradise in which no one had dreamt\nparadox might arise.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1243428)\n\nOne was Berry’s paradox, first suggested to Russell by G. G. Berry, a\nlibrarian at the Bodleian. It has to do with counting the syllables needed to\nspecify each integer. Generally, of course, the larger the number the more\nsyllables are required. In English, the smallest integer requiring two\nsyllables is seven. The smallest requiring three syllables is eleven. The\nnumber 121 seems to require six syllables (“one hundred twenty-one”), but\nactually four will do the job, with some cleverness: “eleven squared.” Still,\neven with cleverness, there are only a finite number of possible syllables and\ntherefore a finite number of names, and, as Russell put it, “Hence the names\nof some integers must consist of at least nineteen syllables, and among these\nthere must be a least. Hence _the least integer not nameable in fewer than\nnineteen syllables_ must denote a definite\ninteger.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1243678)* Now comes the paradox. This\nphrase, _the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables_ ,\ncontains only eighteen syllables. So the least integer not nameable in fewer\nthan nineteen syllables has just been named in fewer than nineteen syllables.\n\nAnother paradox of Russell’s is the Barber paradox. The barber is the man (let\nus say) who shaves all the men, and only those, who do not shave themselves.\nDoes the barber shave himself? If he does he does not, and if he does not he\ndoes. Few people are troubled by such puzzles, because in real life the barber\ndoes as he likes and the world goes on. We tend to feel, as Russell put it,\nthat “the whole form of words is just a noise without\nmeaning.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1243944) But the paradox cannot be\ndismissed so easily when a mathematician examines the subject known as set\ntheory, or the theory of classes. Sets are groups of things—for example,\nintegers. The set 0, 2, 4 has integers as its members. A set can also be a\nmember of other sets. For example, the set 0, 2, 4 belongs to the set of _sets\nof integers_ and the set of _sets with three members_ but not the set of _sets\nof prime numbers_. So Russell defined a certain set this way:\n\n> > _S_ is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.\n\nThis version is known as Russell’s paradox. It cannot be dismissed as noise.\n\nTo eliminate Russell’s paradox Russell took drastic measures. The enabling\nfactor seemed to be the peculiar recursion within the offending statement: the\nidea of sets belonging to sets. Recursion was the oxygen feeding the flame. In\nthe same way, the liar paradox relies on statements about statements. “This\nstatement is false” is meta-language: language about language. Russell’s\nparadoxical set relies on a meta-set: a set of sets. So the problem was a\ncrossing of levels, or, as Russell termed it, a mixing of types. His solution:\ndeclare it illegal, taboo, out of bounds. No mixing different levels of\nabstraction. No self-reference; no self-containment. The rules of symbolism in\n_Principia Mathematica_ would not allow the reaching-back-around, snake-\neating-its-tail feedback loop that seemed to turn on the possibility of self-\ncontradiction. This was his firewall.\n\nEnter Kurt Gödel.\n\nHe was born in 1906 in Brno, at the center of the Czech province of Moravia.\nHe studied physics at the University of Vienna, seventy-five miles south, and\nas a twenty-year-old became part of the Vienna Circle, a group of philosophers\nand mathematicians who met regularly in smoky coffeehouses like the Café\nJosephinum and the Café Reichsrat to propound logic and realism as a bulwark\nagainst metaphysics—by which they meant spiritualism, phenomenology,\nirrationality. Gödel talked to them about the New Logic (this term was in the\nair) and before long about metamathematics— _der Metamathematik_.\nMetamathematics was not to mathematics what metaphysics was to physics. It was\nmathematics once removed—mathematics about mathematics—a formal system “looked\nat from the outside” (“ _äußerlich betrachtet_\n”).[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1244268) He was about to make the most\nimportant statement, prove the most important theorem about knowledge in the\ntwentieth century. He was going to kill Russell’s dream of a perfect logical\nsystem. He was going to show that the paradoxes were not excrescences; they\nwere fundamental.\n\nGödel praised the Russell and Whitehead project before he buried it:\nmathematical logic was, he wrote, “a science prior to all others, which\ncontains the ideas and principles underlying all\nsciences.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1244696) _Principia Mathematica_ ,\nthe great opus, embodied a formal system that had become, in its brief\nlifetime, so comprehensive and so dominant that Gödel referred to it in\nshorthand: PM. By PM he meant the system, as opposed to the book. In PM,\nmathematics had been contained—a ship in a bottle, no longer buffeted and\nturned by the vast unruly seas. By 1930, when mathematicians proved something,\nthey did it according to PM. In PM, as Gödel said, “one can prove any theorem\nusing nothing but a few mechanical\nrules.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1245006)\n\n_Any_ theorem: for the system was, or claimed to be, complete. _Mechanical_\nrules: for the logic operated inexorably, with no room for varying human\ninterpretation. Its symbols were drained of meaning. Anyone could verify a\nproof step by step, by following the rules, without understanding it. Calling\nthis quality mechanical invoked the dreams of Charles Babbage and Ada\nLovelace, machines grinding through numbers, and numbers standing for anything\nat all.\n\nAmid the doomed culture of 1930 Vienna, listening to his new friends debate\nthe New Logic, his manner reticent, his eyes magnified by black-framed round\nspectacles, the twenty-four-year-old Gödel believed in the perfection of the\nbottle that was PM but doubted whether mathematics could truly be contained.\nThis slight young man turned his doubt into a great and horrifying discovery.\nHe found that lurking within PM—and within any consistent system of\nlogic—there must be monsters of a kind hitherto unconceived: statements that\ncan never be proved, and yet can never be disproved. There must be _truths_ ,\nthat is, that cannot be proved—and Gödel could prove it.\n\nHe accomplished this with iron rigor disguised as sleight of hand. He employed\nthe formal rules of PM and, as he employed them, also approached them\nmetamathematically—viewed them, that is, from the outside. As he explained,\nall the symbols of PM—numbers, operations of arithmetic, logical connectors,\nand punctuation—constituted a limited alphabet. Every statement or formula of\nPM was written in this alphabet. Likewise every proof comprised a finite\nsequence of formulas—just a longer passage written in the same alphabet. This\nis where metamathematics came in. Metamathematically, Gödel pointed out, one\nsign is as good as another; the choice of a particular alphabet is arbitrary.\nOne could use the traditional assortment of numerals and glyphs (from\narithmetic: +, −, =, ×; from logic: ¬, ∨, ⊃, ∃), or one could use letters, or\none could use dots and dashes. It was a matter of encoding, slipping from one\nsymbol set to another.\n\nGödel proposed to use numbers for all his signs. Numbers were his alphabet.\nAnd because numbers can be combined using arithmetic, any sequence of numbers\namounts to one (possibly very large) number. So every statement, every formula\nof PM can be expressed as a single number, and so can every proof. Gödel\noutlined a rigorous scheme for doing the encoding—an algorithm, mechanical,\njust rules to follow, no intelligence necessary. It works forward and\nbackward: given any formula, following the rules generates one number, and\ngiven any number, following the rules produces the corresponding formula.\n\nNot every number translates into a correct formula, however. Some numbers\ndecode back into gibberish, or formulas that are false within the rules of the\nsystem. The string of symbols “0 0 0 = = =” does not make a formula at all,\nthough it translates to some number. The statement “0 = 1” is a recognizable\nformula, but it is false. The formula “0 + _x_ = _x_ \\+ 0” is true, and it is\nprovable.\n\nThis last quality—the property of _being provable according to PM_ —was not\nmeant to be expressible in the language of PM. It seems to be a statement from\noutside the system, a metamathematical statement. But Gödel’s encoding reeled\nit in. In the framework he constructed, the natural numbers led a double life,\nas numbers and also as statements. A statement could assert that a given\nnumber is _even_ , or _prime_ , or _a perfect square_ , and a statement could\nalso assert that a given number is _a provable formula_. Given the number\n1,044,045,317,700, for example, one could make various statements and test\ntheir truth or falsity: this number is even, it is not a prime, it is not a\nperfect square, it is greater than 5, it is divisible by 121, and (when\ndecoded according to the official rules) it is a provable formula.\n\nGödel laid all this out in a little paper in 1931. Making his proof watertight\nrequired complex logic, but the basic argument was simple and elegant. Gödel\nshowed how to construct a formula that said _A certain number, x, is not\nprovable_. That was easy: there were infinitely many such formulas. He then\ndemonstrated that, in at least some cases, the number _x_ would happen to\nrepresent that very formula. This was just the looping self-reference that\nRussell had tried to forbid in the rules of PM—\n\n> > _This statement_ is not provable\n\n—and now Gödel showed that such statements must exist anyway. The Liar\nreturned, and it could not be locked out by changing the rules. As Gödel\nexplained (in one of history’s most pregnant footnotes),\n\n> > Contrary to appearances, such a proposition involves no faulty\n> circularity, for it only asserts that a certain well-defined formula … is\n> unprovable. Only subsequently (and so to speak by chance) does it turn out\n> that this formula is precisely the one by which the proposition itself was\n> expressed.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1245315)\n\nWithin PM, and within any consistent logical system capable of elementary\narithmetic, there must always be such accursed statements, true but\nunprovable. Thus Gödel showed that a consistent formal system must be\nincomplete; no complete and consistent system can exist.\n\nThe paradoxes were back, nor were they mere quirks. Now they struck at the\ncore of the enterprise. It was, as Gödel said afterward, an “amazing\nfact”—“that our logical intuitions (i.e., intuitions concerning such notions\nas: truth, concept, being, class, etc.) are self-\ncontradictory.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1245519) It was, as Douglas\nHofstadter says, “a sudden thunderbolt from the bluest of\nskies,”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1245809) its power arising not from the\nedifice it struck down but the lesson it contained about numbers, about\nsymbolism, about encoding:\n\n> > Gödel’s conclusion sprang not from a weakness in PM but from a strength.\n> That strength is the fact that numbers are so flexible or “chameleonic” that\n> their patterns can mimic patterns of reasoning.… PM’s _expressive power_ is\n> what gives rise to its incompleteness.\n\nThe long-sought universal language, the _characteristica universalis_ Leibniz\nhad pretended to invent, had been there all along, in the numbers. Numbers\ncould encode all of reasoning. They could represent any form of knowledge.\n\nGödel’s first public mention of his discovery, on the third and last day of a\nphilosophical conference in Königsberg in 1930, drew no response; only one\nperson seems to have heard him at all, a Hungarian named Neumann János. This\nyoung mathematician was in the process of moving to the United States, where\nhe would soon and for the rest of his life be called John von Neumann. He\nunderstood Gödel’s import at once; it stunned him, but he studied it and was\npersuaded. No sooner did Gödel’s paper appear than von Neumann was presenting\nit to the mathematics colloquium at Princeton. Incompleteness was real. It\nmeant that mathematics could never be proved free of self-contradiction. And\n“the important point,” von Neumann said, “is that this is not a philosophical\nprinciple or a plausible intellectual attitude, but the result of a rigorous\nmathematical proof of an extremely sophisticated\nkind.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1246057) Either you believed in\nmathematics or you did not.\n\nBertrand Russell (who, of course, _did_) had moved on to more gentle sorts of\nphilosophy. Much later, as an old man, he admitted that Gödel had troubled\nhim: “It made me glad that I was no longer working at mathematical logic. If a\ngiven set of axioms leads to a contradiction, it is clear that at least one of\nthe axioms must be false.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1246402) On the other\nhand, Vienna’s most famous philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein (who,\nfundamentally, _did not_), dismissed the incompleteness theorem as trickery (“\n_Kunststücken_ ”) and boasted that rather than try to refute it, he would\nsimply pass it by:\n\n> > Mathematics cannot be incomplete; any more than a _sense_ can be\n> incomplete. Whatever I can understand, I must completely\n> understand.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1246600)\n\nGödel’s retort took care of them both. “Russell evidently misinterprets my\nresult; however, he does so in a very interesting manner,” he wrote. “In\ncontradistinction Wittgenstein … advances a completely trivial and\nuninteresting misinterpretation.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1246891)\n\nIn 1933 the newly formed Institute for Advanced Study, with John von Neumann\nand Albert Einstein among its first faculty members, invited Gödel to\nPrinceton for the year. He crossed the Atlantic several more times that\ndecade, as fascism rose and the brief glory of Vienna began to fade. Gödel,\nignorant of politics and naïve about history, suffered depressive breakdowns\nand bouts of hypochondria that forced him into sanatoria. Princeton beckoned\nbut Gödel vacillated. He stayed in Vienna in 1938, through the _Anschluss_ ,\nas the Vienna Circle ceased to be, its members murdered or exiled, and even in\n1939, when Hitler’s army occupied his native Czechoslovakia. He was not a Jew,\nbut mathematics was _verjudet_ enough. He finally managed to leave in January\n1940 by way of the Trans-Siberian Railway, Japan, and a ship to San Francisco.\nHis name was recoded by the telephone company as “K. Goedel” when he arrived\nin Princeton, this time to stay.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1247181)\n\nClaude Shannon had also arrived at the Institute for Advanced Study, to spend\na postdoctoral year. He found it a lonely place, occupying a new red-brick\nbuilding with clocktower and cupola framed by elms on a former farm a mile\nfrom Princeton University. The first of its fifteen or so professors was\nEinstein, whose office was at the back of the first floor; Shannon seldom laid\neyes on him. Gödel, who had arrived in March, hardly spoke to anyone but\nEinstein. Shannon’s nominal supervisor was Hermann Weyl, another German exile,\nthe most formidable mathematical theorist of the new quantum mechanics. Weyl\nwas only mildly interested in Shannon’s thesis on genetics—“your bio-\nmathematical problems”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1247470)—but thought\nShannon might find common ground with the institute’s other great young\nmathematician, von Neumann. Mostly Shannon stayed moodily in his room in\nPalmer Square. His twenty-year-old wife, having left Radcliffe to be with him,\nfound it increasingly grim, staying home while Claude played clarinet\naccompaniment to his Bix Beiderbecke record on the phonograph. Norma thought\nhe was depressed and wanted him to see a psychiatrist. Meeting Einstein was\nnice, but the thrill wore off. Their marriage was over; she was gone by the\nend of the year.\n\nNor could Shannon stay in Princeton. He wanted to pursue the transmission of\nintelligence, a notion poorly defined and yet more pragmatic than the heady\ntheoretical physics that dominated the institute’s agenda. Furthermore, war\napproached. Research agendas were changing everywhere. Vannevar Bush was now\nheading the National Defense Research Committee, which assigned Shannon\n“Project 7”:[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1247734) the mathematics of fire-\ncontrol mechanisms for antiaircraft guns—“the job,” as the NDRC reported\ndryly, “of applying corrections to the gun control so that the shell and the\ntarget will arrive at the same position at the same\ntime.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1248050) Airplanes had suddenly rendered\nobsolete almost all the mathematics used in ballistics: for the first time,\nthe targets were moving at speeds not much less than the missiles themselves.\nThe problem was complex and critical, on ships and on land. London was\norganizing batteries of heavy guns firing 3.7-inch shells. Aiming projectiles\nat fast-moving aircraft needed either intuition and luck or a vast amount of\nimplicit computation by gears and linkages and servos. Shannon analyzed\nphysical problems as well as computational problems: the machinery had to\ntrack rapid paths in three dimensions, with shafts and gears controlled by\nrate finders and integrators. An antiaircraft gun in itself behaved as a\ndynamical system, subject to “backlash” and oscillations that might or might\nnot be predictable. (Where the differential equations were nonlinear, Shannon\nmade little headway and knew it.)\n\nHe had spent two of his summers working for Bell Telephone Laboratories in New\nYork; its mathematics department was also taking on the fire-control project\nand asked Shannon to join. This was work for which the Differential Analyzer\nhad prepared him well. An automated antiaircraft gun was already an analog\ncomputer: it had to convert what were, in effect, second-order differential\nequations into mechanical motion; it had to accept input from rangefinder\nsightings or new, experimental radar; and it had to smooth and filter this\ndata, to compensate for errors.\n\nAt Bell Labs, the last part of this problem looked familiar. It resembled an\nissue that plagued communication by telephone. The noisy data looked like\nstatic on the line. “There is an obvious analogy,” Shannon and his colleagues\nreported, “between the problem of smoothing the data to eliminate or reduce\nthe effect of tracking errors and the problem of separating a signal from\ninterfering noise in communications\nsystems.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1248440) The data constituted a\nsignal; the whole problem was “a special case of the transmission,\nmanipulation, and utilization of intelligence.” Their specialty, at Bell Labs.\n\nTransformative as the telegraph had been, miraculous as the wireless radio now\nseemed, electrical communication now meant the telephone. The “electrical\nspeaking telephone” first appeared in the United States with the establishment\nof a few experimental circuits in the 1870s. By the turn of the century, the\ntelephone industry surpassed the telegraph by every measure—number of\nmessages, miles of wire, capital invested—and telephone usage was doubling\nevery few years. There was no mystery about why: anyone could use a telephone.\nThe only skills required were talking and listening: no writing, no codes, no\nkeypads. Everyone responded to the sound of the human voice; it conveyed not\njust words but feeling.\n\nThe advantages were obvious—but not to everyone. Elisha Gray, a telegraph man\nwho came close to trumping Alexander Graham Bell as inventor of the telephone,\ntold his own patent lawyer in 1875 that the work was hardly worthwhile: “Bell\nseems to be spending all his energies in [the] talking telegraph. While this\nis very interesting scientifically it has no commercial value at present, for\nthey can do much more business over a line by methods already in\nuse.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1249082) Three years later, when Theodore\nN. Vail quit the Post Office Department to become the first general manager\n(and only salaried officer) of the new Bell Telephone Company, the assistant\npostmaster general wrote angrily, “I can scarce believe that a man of your\nsound judgment … should throw it up for a d——d old Yankee notion (a piece of\nwire with two Texan steer horns attached to the ends, with an arrangement to\nmake the concern blate like a calf) called a\ntelephone!”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1249440) The next year, in England,\nthe chief engineer of the General Post Office, William Preece, reported to\nParliament: “I fancy the descriptions we get of its use in America are a\nlittle exaggerated, though there are conditions in America which necessitate\nthe use of such instruments more than here. Here we have a superabundance of\nmessengers, errand boys and things of that kind.… I have one in my office, but\nmore for show. If I want to send a message—I use a sounder or employ a boy to\ntake it.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1249796)\n\nOne reason for these misguesses was just the usual failure of imagination in\nthe face of a radically new technology. The telegraph lay in plain view, but\nits lessons did not extrapolate well to this new device. The telegraph\ndemanded literacy; the telephone embraced orality. A message sent by telegraph\nhad first to be written, encoded, and tapped out by a trained intermediary. To\nemploy the telephone, one just talked. A child could use it. For that very\nreason it seemed like a toy. In fact, it seemed like a familiar toy, made from\ntin cylinders and string. The telephone left no permanent record. _The\nTelephone_ had no future as a newspaper name. Business people thought it\nunserious. Where the telegraph dealt in facts and numbers, the telephone\nappealed to emotions.\n\nThe new Bell company had little trouble turning this into a selling point. Its\npromoters liked to quote Pliny, “The living voice is that which sways the\nsoul,” and Thomas Middleton, “How sweetly sounds the voice of a good woman.”\nOn the other hand, there was anxiety about the notion of capturing and\nreifying voices—the phonograph, too, had just arrived. As one commentator\nsaid, “No matter to what extent a man may close his doors and windows, and\nhermetically seal his key-holes and furnace-registers with towels and\nblankets, whatever he may say, either to himself or a companion, will be\noverheard.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1250072) Voices, hitherto, had\nremained mostly private.\n\nThe new contraption had to be explained, and generally this began by\ncomparison to telegraphy. There were a transmitter and receiver, and wires\nconnected them, and _something_ was carried along the wire in the form of\nelectricity. In the case of the telephone, that thing was sound, simply\nconverted from waves of pressure in the air to waves of electric current. One\nadvantage was apparent: the telephone would surely be useful to musicians.\nBell himself, traveling around the country as impresario for the new\ntechnology, encouraged this way of thinking, giving demonstrations in concert\nhalls, where full orchestras and choruses played “America” and “Auld Lang\nSyne” into his gadgetry. He encouraged people to think of the telephone as a\nbroadcasting device, to send music and sermons across long distances, bringing\nthe concert hall and the church into the living room. Newspapers and\ncommentators mostly went along. That is what comes of analyzing a technology\nin the abstract. As soon as people laid their hands on telephones, they worked\nout what to do. They talked.\n\nIn a lecture at Cambridge, the physicist James Clerk Maxwell offered a\nscientific description of the telephone conversation: “The speaker talks to\nthe transmitter at one end of the line, and at the other end of the line the\nlistener puts his ear to the receiver, and hears what the speaker said. The\nprocess in its two extreme states is so exactly similar to the old-fashioned\nmethod of speaking and hearing that no preparatory practice is required on the\npart of either operator.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1250336) He, too, had\nnoticed its ease of use.\n\nSo by 1880, four years after Bell conveyed the words “Mr. Watson, come here, I\nwant to see you,” and three years after the first pair of telephones rented\nfor twenty dollars, more than sixty thousand telephones were in use in the\nUnited States. The first customers bought pairs of telephones for\ncommunication point to point: between a factory and its business office, for\nexample. Queen Victoria installed one at Windsor Castle and one at Buckingham\nPalace (fabricated in ivory; a gift from the savvy Bell). The topology changed\nwhen the number of sets reachable by other sets passed a critical threshold,\nand that happened surprisingly soon. Then community networks arose, their\nmultiple connections managed through a new apparatus called a switch-board.\n\nThe initial phase of ignorance and skepticism passed in an eyeblink. The\nsecond phase of amusement and entertainment did not last much longer.\nBusinesses quickly forgot their qualms about the device’s seriousness. Anyone\ncould be a telephone prophet now—some of the same predictions had already been\nheard in regard to the telegraph—but the most prescient comments came from\nthose who focused on the exponential power of interconnection. _Scientific\nAmerican_ assessed “The Future of the Telephone” as early as 1880 and\nemphasized the forming of “little clusters of telephonic communicants.” The\nlarger the network and the more diverse its interests, the greater its\npotential would be.\n\n> > What the telegraph accomplished in years the telephone has done in months.\n> One year it was a scientific toy, with infinite possibilities of practical\n> use; the next it was the basis of a system of communication the most rapidly\n> expanding, intricate, and convenient that the world has known.… Soon it will\n> be the rule and not the exception for business houses, indeed for the\n> dwellings of well-to-do people as well, to be interlocked by means of\n> telephone exchange, not merely in our cities, but in all outlying regions.\n> The result can be nothing less than a new organization of society—a state of\n> things in which every individual, however secluded, will have at call every\n> other individual in the community, to the saving of no end of social and\n> business complications, of needless goings to and fro, of disappointments,\n> delays, and a countless host of those great and little evils and annoyances.\n>\n\n>> The time is close at hand when the scattered members of civilized\ncommunities will be as closely united, so far as instant telephonic\ncommunication is concerned, as the various members of the body now are by the\nnervous system.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1250677)\n\nThe scattered members using telephones numbered half a million by 1890; by\n1914, 10 million. The telephone was already thought, correctly, to be\nresponsible for rapid industrial progress. The case could hardly be\noverstated. The areas depending on “instantaneous communication across\nspace”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1250909) were listed by the United States\nCommerce Department in 1907: “agriculture, mining, commerce, manufacturing,\ntransportation, and, in fact, all the various branches of production and\ndistribution of natural and artificial resources.” Not to mention “cobblers,\ncleaners of clothing, and even laundresses.” In other words, every cog in the\nengine of the economy. “Existence of telephone traffic is essentially an\nindication that time is being saved,” the department commented. It observed\nchanges in the structure of life and society that would still seem new a\ncentury later: “The last few years have seen such an extension of telephone\nlines through the various summer-resort districts of the country that it has\nbecome practicable for business men to leave their offices for several days at\na time, and yet keep in close touch with their offices.” In 1908 John J.\nCarty, who became the first head of the Bell Laboratories, offered an\ninformation-based analysis to show how the telephone had shaped the New York\nskyline—arguing that the telephone, as much as the elevator, had made\nskyscrapers possible.\n\n> > It may sound ridiculous to say that Bell and his successors were the\n> fathers of modern commercial architecture—of the skyscraper. But wait a\n> minute. Take the Singer Building, the Flatiron Building, the Broad Exchange,\n> the Trinity, or any of the giant office buildings. How many messages do you\n> suppose go in and out of those buildings every day? Suppose there was no\n> telephone and every message had to be carried by a personal messenger? How\n> much room do you think the necessary elevators would leave for offices? Such\n> structures would be an economic\n> impossibility.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1251164)\n\nTo enable the fast expansion of this extraordinary network, the telephone\ndemanded new technologies and new science. They were broadly of two kinds. One\nhad to do with electricity itself: measuring electrical quantities;\ncontrolling the electromagnetic wave, as it was now understood—its modulation\nin amplitude and in frequency. Maxwell had established in the 1860s that\nelectrical pulses and magnetism and light itself were all manifestations of a\nsingle force: “affectations of the same substance,” light being one more case\nof “an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to\nelectromagnetic laws.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1251471) These were the\nlaws that electrical engineers now had to apply, unifying telephone and radio\namong other technologies. Even the telegraph employed a simple kind of\namplitude modulation, in which only two values mattered, a maximum for “on”\nand a minimum for “off.” To convey sound required far stronger current, far\nmore delicately controlled. The engineers had to understand feedback: a\ncoupling of the output of a power amplifier, such as a telephone mouthpiece,\nwith its input. They had to design vacuum-tube repeaters to carry the electric\ncurrent over long distance, making possible the first transcontinental line in\n1914, between New York and San Francisco, 3,400 miles of wire suspended from\n130,000 poles. The engineers also discovered how to modulate individual\ncurrents so as to combine them in a single channel—multiplexing—without losing\ntheir identity. By 1918 they could get four conversations into a single pair\nof wires. But it was not _currents_ that preserved identity. Before the\nengineers quite realized it, they were thinking in terms of the transmission\nof a _signal_ , an abstract entity, quite distinct from the electrical waves\nin which it was embodied.\n\nA second, less well defined sort of science concerned the organizing of\nconnections—switching, numbering, and logic. This branch descended from Bell’s\noriginal realization, dating from 1877, that telephones need not be sold in\npairs; that each individual telephone could be connected to many other\ntelephones, not by direct wires but through a central “exchange.” George W.\nCoy, a telegraph man in New Haven, Connecticut, built the first “switch-board”\nthere, complete with “switch-pins” and “switch-plugs” made from carriage bolts\nand wire from discarded bustles. He patented it and served as the world’s\nfirst telephone “operator.” With all the making and breaking of connections,\nswitch-pins wore out quickly. An early improvement was a hinged two-inch plate\nresembling a jackknife: the “jack-knife switch,” or as it was soon called, the\n“jack.” In January 1878, Coy’s switchboard could manage two simultaneous\nconversations between any of the exchange’s twenty-one customers. In February,\nCoy published a list of subscribers: himself and some friends; several\nphysicians and dentists; the post office, police station, and mercantile club;\nand some meat and fish markets. This has been called the world’s first\ntelephone directory, but it was hardly that: one page, not alphabetized, and\nno numbers associated with the names. The telephone number had yet to be\ninvented.\n\nThat innovation came the next year in Lowell, Massachusetts, where by the end\nof 1879 four operators managed the connections among two hundred subscribers\nby shouting to one another across the switchboard room. An epidemic of measles\nbroke out, and Dr. Moses Greeley Parker worried that if the operators\nsuccumbed, they would be hard to replace. He suggested identifying each\ntelephone by number. He also suggested listing the numbers in an alphabetical\ndirectory of subscribers. These ideas could not be patented and arose again in\ntelephone exchanges across the country, where the burgeoning networks were\ncreating clusters of data in need of organization. Telephone books soon\nrepresented the most comprehensive listings of, and directories to, human\npopulations ever attempted. (They became the thickest and densest of the\nworld’s books—four volumes for London; a 2,600-page tome for Chicago—and\nseemed a permanent, indispensable part of the world’s information ecology\nuntil, suddenly, they were not. They went obsolete, effectively, at the turn\nof the twenty-first century. American telephone companies were officially\nphasing them out by 2010; in New York, the end of automatic delivery of\ntelephone directories was estimated to save 5,000 tons of paper.)\n\nAt first, customers resented the impersonality of telephone numbers, and\nengineers doubted whether people could remember a number of more than four or\nfive digits. The Bell Company finally had to insist. The first telephone\noperators were teenage boys, cheaply hired from the ranks of telegraph\nmessengers, but exchanges everywhere discovered that boys were wild, given to\nclowning and practical jokes, and more likely to be found wrestling on the\nfloor than sitting on stools to perform the exacting, repetitive work of a\nswitchboard operator.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1251807) A new source of\ncheap labor was available, and by 1881 virtually every telephone operator was\na woman. In Cincinnati, for example, W. H. Eckert reported hiring sixty-six\n“young ladies” who were “very much superior” to boys: “They are steadier, do\nnot drink beer, and are always on\nhand.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1252167) He hardly needed to add that the\ncompany could pay a woman as little as or less than a teenage boy. It was\nchallenging work that soon required training. Operators had to be quick in\ndistinguishing many different voices and accents, had to maintain a polite\nequilibrium in the face of impatience and rudeness, as they engaged in long\nhours of athletic upper-body exercise, wearing headsets like harnesses. Some\nmen thought this was good for them. “The action of stretching her arms up\nabove her head, and to the right and left of her, develops her chest and\narms,” said _Every Woman’s Encyclopedia_ , “and turns thin and weedy girls\ninto strong ones. There are no anaemic, unhealthy looking girls in the\noperating rooms.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1252522) Along with another\nnew technology, the typewriter, the telephone switchboard catalyzed the\nintroduction of women into the white-collar workforce, but battalions of human\noperators could not sustain a network on the scale now arising. Switching\nwould have to be performed automatically.\n\nThis meant a mechanical linkage to take from callers not just the sound of\ntheir voice but also a number—identifying a person, or at least another\ntelephone. The challenge of converting a number into electrical form still\nrequired ingenuity: first push buttons were tried, then an awkward-seeming\nrotary dial, with ten finger positions for the decimal digits, sending pulses\ndown the line. Then the coded pulses served as an agent of control at the\ncentral exchange, where another mechanism selected from an array of circuits\nand set up a connection. Altogether this made for an unprecedented degree of\ncomplexity in the translations between human and machine, number and\ncircuitry. The point was not lost on the company, which liked to promote its\nautomatic switches as “electrical brains.” Having borrowed from telegraphy the\nelectromechanical relay—using one circuit to control another—the telephone\ncompanies had reduced it in size and weight to less than four ounces and now\nmanufactured several million each year.\n\n“The telephone remains the acme of electrical marvels,” wrote a historian in\n1910—a historian of the telephone, already. “No other thing does so much with\nso little energy. No other thing is more enswathed in the\nunknown.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1252823) New York City had several\nhundred thousand listed telephone customers, and _Scribner’s Magazine_\nhighlighted this astounding fact: “Any two of that large number can, in five\nseconds, be placed in communication with each other, so well has engineering\nscience kept pace with public needs.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1253092)\nTo make the connections, the switchboard had grown to a monster of 2 million\nsoldered parts, 4,000 miles of wire, and 15,000 signal\nlamps.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1253385) By 1925, when an assortment of\ntelephone research groups were formally organized into the Bell Telephone\nLaboratories, a mechanical “line finder” with a capacity of 400 lines was\nreplacing 22-point electromechanical rotary switches. The American Telephone &\nTelegraph Company was consolidating its monopoly. Engineers struggled to\nminimize the hunt time. At first, long-distance calling required reaching a\nsecond, “toll” operator and waiting for a call back; soon the interconnection\nof local exchanges would have to allow for automatic dialing. The complexities\nmultiplied. Bell Labs needed mathematicians.\n\nWhat began as the Mathematics Consulting Department grew into a center of\npractical mathematics like none other. It was not like the prestigious\ncitadels, Harvard and Princeton. To the academic world it was barely visible.\nIts first director, Thornton C. Fry, enjoyed the tension between theory and\npractice—the clashing cultures. “For the mathematician, an argument is either\nperfect in every detail or else it is wrong,” he wrote in 1941. “He calls this\n‘rigorous thinking.’ The typical engineer calls it ‘hair-splitting.’\n”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1253719)\n\n> > The mathematician also tends to idealize any situation with which he is\n> confronted. His gases are “ideal,” his conductors “perfect,” his surfaces\n> “smooth.” He calls this “getting down to essentials.” The engineer is likely\n> to dub it “ignoring the facts.”\n\nIn other words, the mathematicians and engineers could not do without each\nother. Every electrical engineer could now handle the basic analysis of waves\ntreated as sinusoidal signals. But new difficulties arose in understanding the\naction of networks; network theorems were devised to handle these\nmathematically. Mathematicians applied queuing theory to usage conflicts;\ndeveloped graphs and trees to manage issues of intercity trunks and lines; and\nused combinatorial analysis to break down telephone probability problems.\n\nThen there was noise. This did not at first (to Alexander Graham Bell, for\nexample) seem like a problem for theorists. It was just there, always crowding\nthe line—pops, hisses, crackles interfering with, or degrading, the voice that\nhad entered the mouthpiece. It plagued radio, too. At best it stayed in the\nbackground and people hardly noticed; at worst the weedy profusion spurred the\ncustomers’ imaginations:\n\n> > There was sputtering and bubbling, jerking and rasping, whistling and\n> screaming. There was the rustling of leaves, the croaking of frogs, the\n> hissing of steam, and the flapping of birds’ wings. There were clicks from\n> telegraph wires, scraps of talk from other telephones, curious little\n> squeals that were unlike any known sound.… The night was noisier than the\n> day, and at the ghostly hour of midnight, for what strange reasons no one\n> knows, the babel was at its height.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1254009)\n\nBut engineers could now _see_ the noise on their oscilloscopes, interfering\nwith and degrading their clean waveforms, and naturally they wanted to measure\nit, even if there was something quixotic about measuring a nuisance so random\nand ghostly. There was a way, in fact, and Albert Einstein had shown what it\nwas.\n\nIn 1905, his finest year, Einstein published a paper on Brownian motion, the\nrandom, jittery motion of tiny particles suspended in a fluid. Antony van\nLeeuwenhoek had discovered it with his early microscope, and the phenomenon\nwas named after Robert Brown, the Scottish botanist who studied it carefully\nin 1827: first pollen in water, then soot and powdered rock. Brown convinced\nhimself that these particles were not alive—they were not animalcules—yet they\nwould not sit still. In a mathematical tour de force, Einstein explained this\nas a consequence of the heat energy of molecules, whose existence he thereby\nproved. Microscopically visible particles, like pollen, are bombarded by\nmolecular collisions and are light enough to be jolted randomly this way and\nthat. The fluctuations of the particles, individually unpredictable,\ncollectively express the laws of statistical mechanics. Although the fluid may\nbe at rest and the system in thermodynamic equilibrium, the irregular motion\nperseveres, as long as the temperature is above absolute zero. By the same\ntoken, he showed that random thermal agitation would also affect free\nelectrons in any electrical conductor—making noise.\n\nPhysicists paid little attention to the electrical aspects of Einstein’s work,\nand it was not until 1927 that thermal noise in circuits was put on a rigorous\nmathematical footing, by two Swedes working at Bell Labs. John B. Johnson was\nthe first to measure what he realized was noise intrinsic to the circuit, as\nopposed to evidence of flawed design. Then Harry Nyquist explained it,\nderiving formulas for the fluctuations in current and in voltage in an\nidealized network. Nyquist was the son of a farmer and shoemaker who was\noriginally called Lars Jonsson but had to find a new name because his mail was\ngetting mixed up with another Lars Jonsson’s. The Nyquists immigrated to the\nUnited States when Harry was a teenager; he made his way from North Dakota to\nBell Labs by way of Yale, where he got a doctorate in physics. He always\nseemed to have his eye on the big picture—which did not mean telephony per se.\nAs early as 1918, he began working on a method for transmitting pictures by\nwire: “telephotography.” His idea was to mount a photograph on a spinning\ndrum, scan it, and generate currents proportional to the lightness or darkness\nof the image. By 1924 the company had a working prototype that could send a\nfive-by-seven-inch picture in seven minutes. But Nyquist meanwhile was looking\nbackward, too, and that same year, at an electrical engineers’ convention in\nPhiladelphia, gave a talk with the modest title “Certain Factors Affecting\nTelegraph Speed.”\n\nIt had been known since the dawn of telegraphy that the fundamental units of\nmessaging were discrete: dots and dashes. It became equally obvious in the\ntelephone era that, on the contrary, useful information was continuous: sounds\nand colors, shading into one another, blending seamlessly along a spectrum of\nfrequencies. So which was it? Physicists like Nyquist were dealing with\nelectric currents as waveforms, even when they were conveying discrete\ntelegraph signals. Nowadays most of the current in a telegraph line was being\nwasted. In Nyquist’s way of thinking, if those continuous signals could\nrepresent anything as complex as voices, then the simple stuff of telegraphy\nwas just a special case. Specifically, it was a special case of amplitude\nmodulation, in which the only interesting amplitudes were _on_ and _off_. By\ntreating the telegraph signals as pulses in the shape of waveforms, engineers\ncould speed their transmission and could combine them in a single\ncircuit—could combine them, too, with voice channels. Nyquist wanted to know\n_how much_ —how much telegraph data, how fast. To answer that question he\nfound an ingenious approach to converting continuous waves into data that was\ndiscrete, or “digital.” Nyquist’s method was to sample the waves at intervals,\nin effect converting them into countable pieces.\n\nA circuit carried waves of many different frequencies: a “band” of waves,\nengineers would say. The range of frequencies—the width of that band, or “band\nwidth”—served as a measure of the capacity of the circuit. A telephone line\ncould handle frequencies from about 400 to 3,400 hertz, or waves per second,\nfor a bandwidth of 3,000 hertz. (That would cover most of the sound from an\norchestra, but the high notes of the piccolo would be cut off.) Nyquist wanted\nto put this as generally as he could. He calculated a formula for the “speed\nof transmission of intelligence.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1254285) To\ntransmit intelligence at a certain speed, he showed, a channel needs a\ncertain, measurable bandwidth. If the bandwidth was too small, it would be\nnecessary to slow down the transmission. (But with time and ingenuity, it was\nrealized later, even complex messages could be sent across a channel of very\nsmall bandwidth: a drum, for example, beaten by hand, sounding notes of only\ntwo pitches.)\n\nNyquist’s colleague Ralph Hartley, who had begun his career as an expert on\nradio receivers, extended these results in a presentation in the summer of\n1927, at an international congress on the shore of Lake Como, Italy. Hartley\nused a different word, “information.” It was a good occasion for grand ideas.\nScientists had gathered from around the world for the centennial of Alessandro\nVolta’s death. Niels Bohr spoke on the new quantum theory and introduced for\nthe first time his concept of complementarity. Hartley offered his listeners\nboth a fundamental theorem and a new set of definitions.\n\nThe theorem was an extension of Nyquist’s formula, and it could be expressed\nin words: the most information that can be transmitted in any given time is\nproportional to the available frequency range (he did not yet use the term\n_bandwidth_). Hartley was bringing into the open a set of ideas and\nassumptions that were becoming part of the unconscious culture of electrical\nengineering, and the culture of Bell Labs especially. First was the idea of\ninformation itself. He needed to pin a butterfly to the board. “As commonly\nused,” he said, “information is a very elastic\nterm.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1254598) It is the stuff of\ncommunication—which, in turn, can be direct speech, writing, or anything else.\nCommunication takes place by means of symbols—Hartley cited for example\n“words” and “dots and dashes.” The symbols, by common agreement, convey\n“meaning.” So far, this was one slippery concept after another. If the goal\nwas to “eliminate the psychological factors involved” and to establish a\nmeasure “in terms of purely physical quantities,” Hartley needed something\ndefinite and countable. He began by counting symbols—never mind what they\nmeant. Any transmission contained a countable number of symbols. Each symbol\nrepresented a choice; each was selected from a certain set of possible\nsymbols—an alphabet, for example—and the number of possibilities, too, was\ncountable. The number of possible words is not so easy to count, but even in\nordinary language, each word represents a selection from a set of\npossibilities:\n\n> > For example, in the sentence, “Apples are red,” the first word eliminated\n> other kinds of fruit and all other objects in general. The second directs\n> attention to some property or condition of apples, and the third eliminates\n> other possible colors.…\n>\n\n>> The number of symbols available at any one selection obviously varies\nwidely with the type of symbols used, with the particular communicators and\nwith the degree of previous understanding existing between\nthem.[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1254899)\n\nHartley had to admit that some symbols might convey more information, as the\nword was _commonly_ understood, than others. “For example, the single word\n‘yes’ or ‘no,’ when coming at the end of a protracted discussion, may have an\nextraordinarily great significance.” His listeners could think of their own\nexamples. But the point was to subtract human knowledge from the equation.\nTelegraphs and telephones are, after all, stupid.\n\nIt seemed intuitively clear that the amount of information should be\nproportional to the number of symbols: twice as many symbols, twice as much\ninformation. But a dot or dash—a symbol in a set with just two members—carries\nless information than a letter of the alphabet and much less information than\na word chosen from a thousand-word dictionary. The more possible symbols, the\nmore information each selection carries. How much more? The equation, as\nHartley wrote it, was this:\n\n> _H_ = _n_ log _s_\n\nwhere _H_ is the amount of information, _n_ is the number of symbols\ntransmitted, and _s_ is the size of the alphabet. In a dot-dash system, _s_ is\njust 2. A single Chinese character carries so much more weight than a Morse\ndot or dash; it is so much more valuable. In a system with a symbol for every\nword in a thousand-word dictionary, _s_ would be 1,000.\n\nThe amount of information is not proportional to the alphabet size, however.\nThat relationship is logarithmic: to double the amount of information, it is\nnecessary to square the alphabet size. Hartley illustrated this in terms of a\nprinting telegraph—one of the hodgepodge of devices, from obsolete to\nnewfangled, being hooked up to electrical circuits. Such telegraphs used\nkeypads arranged according to a system devised in France by Émile Baudot. The\nhuman operators used keypads, that is—the device translated these key presses,\nas usual, into the opening and closing of telegraph contacts. The Baudot code\nused five units to transmit each character, so the number of possible\ncharacters was 25 or 32. In terms of information content, each such character\nwas five times as valuable—not thirty-two times—as its basic binary units.\n\nTelephones, meanwhile, were sending their human voices across the network in\nhappy, curvaceous analog waves. Where were the symbols in those? How could\nthey be counted?\n\nHartley followed Nyquist in arguing that the continuous curve should be\nthought of as the limit approached by a succession of discrete steps, and that\nthe steps could be recovered, in effect, by sampling the waveform at\nintervals. That way telephony could be made subject to the same mathematical\ntreatment as telegraphy. By a crude but convincing analysis, he showed that in\nboth cases the total amount of information would depend on two factors: the\ntime available for transmission and the bandwidth of the channel. Phonograph\nrecords and motion pictures could be analyzed the same way.\n\nThese odd papers by Nyquist and Hartley attracted little immediate attention.\nThey were hardly suitable for any prestigious journal of mathematics or\nphysics, but Bell Labs had its own, _The Bell System Technical Journal_ , and\nClaude Shannon read them there. He absorbed the mathematical insights, sketchy\nthough they were—first awkward steps toward a shadowy goal. He noted also the\ndifficulties both men had in defining their terms. “By the speed of\ntransmission of intelligence is meant the number of characters, representing\ndifferent letters, figures, etc., which can be transmitted in a given length\nof time.”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1255118) Characters, letters, figures:\nhard to count. There were concepts, too, for which terms had yet to be\ninvented: “the capacity of a system to transmit a particular sequence of\nsymbols …”[](dummy_split_041.html#filepos1255392)\n\n![](images/00039.jpg)\n\nTHE BAUDOT CODE\n\nShannon felt the promise of unification. The communications engineers were\ntalking not just about wires but also the air, the “ether,” and even punched\ntape. They were contemplating not just words but also sounds and images. They\nwere representing the whole world as symbols, in electricity.\n\n* * *\n\n* In an evaluation forty years later the geneticist James F. Crow wrote: “It seems to have been written in complete isolation from the population genetics community.…[Shannon] discovered principles that were rediscovered later.… My regret is that [it] did not become widely known in 1940. It would have changed the history of the subject substantially, I think.”\n\n* In standard English, as Russell noted, it is one hundred and eleven thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven.\n\n\n# 7 | INFORMATION THEORY\n\n\n##\n\n> (All I’m After Is Just a Mundane Brain)\n\n> _Perhaps coming up with a theory of information and its processing is a bit\n> like building a transcontinental railway.

Even Turing’s presence at Bell Labs was a sort of secret. He\nhad come over on the _Queen Elizabeth_ , zigzagging to elude U-boats, after a\nclandestine triumph at Bletchley Park in deciphering Enigma, the code used by\nthe German military for its critical communication (including signals to the\nU-boats). Shannon was working on the X System, used for encrypting voice\nconversations between Franklin D. Roosevelt at the Pentagon and Winston\nChurchill in his War Rooms. It operated by sampling the analog voice signal\nfifty times a second—“quantizing” or “digitizing” it—and masking it by\napplying a random key, which happened to bear a strong resemblance to the\ncircuit noise with which the engineers were so familiar. Shannon did not\ndesign the system; he was assigned to analyze it theoretically and—it was\nhoped—prove it to be unbreakable. He accomplished this. It was clear later\nthat these men, on their respective sides of the Atlantic, had done more than\nanyone else to turn cryptography from an art into a science, but for now the\ncode makers and code breakers were not talking to each other.\n\nWith that subject off the table, Turing showed Shannon a paper he had written\nseven years earlier, called “On Computable Numbers,” about the powers and\nlimitations of an idealized computing machine. They talked about another topic\nthat turned out to be close to their hearts, the possibility of machines\nlearning to think. Shannon proposed feeding “cultural things,” such as music,\nto an electronic brain, and they outdid each other in brashness, Turing\nexclaiming once, “No, I’m not interested in developing a _powerful_ brain. All\nI’m after is just a _mundane_ brain, something like the president of the\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph\nCompany.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1256534) It bordered on impudence to\ntalk about thinking machines in 1943, when both the transistor and the\nelectronic computer had yet to be born. The vision Shannon and Turing shared\nhad nothing to do with electronics; it was about logic.\n\n_Can machines think_? was a question with a relatively brief and slightly odd\ntradition—odd because machines were so adamantly physical in themselves.\nCharles Babbage and Ada Lovelace lay near the beginning of this tradition,\nthough they were all but forgotten, and now the trail led to Alan Turing, who\ndid something really outlandish: thought up a machine with ideal powers in the\nmental realm and showed what it could _not_ do. His machine never existed\n(except that now it exists everywhere). It was only a thought experiment.\n\nRunning alongside the issue of what a machine could do was a parallel issue:\nwhat tasks were _mechanical_ (an old word with new significance). Now that\nmachines could play music, capture images, aim antiaircraft guns, connect\ntelephone calls, control assembly lines, and perform mathematical\ncalculations, the word did not seem quite so pejorative. But only the fearful\nand superstitious imagined that machines could be creative or original or\nspontaneous; those qualities were opposite to _mechanical_ , which meant\nautomatic, determined, and routine. This concept now came in handy for\nphilosophers. An example of an intellectual object that could be called\nmechanical was the algorithm: another new term for something that had always\nexisted (a recipe, a set of instructions, a step-by-step procedure) but now\ndemanded formal recognition. Babbage and Lovelace trafficked in algorithms\nwithout naming them. The twentieth century gave algorithms a central\nrole—beginning here.\n\nTuring was a fellow and a recent graduate at King’s College, Cambridge, when\nhe presented his computable-numbers paper to his professor in 1936. The full\ntitle finished with a flourish in fancy German: it was “On Computable Numbers,\nwith an Application to the _Entscheidungsproblem_.” The “decision problem” was\na challenge that had been posed by David Hilbert at the 1928 International\nCongress of Mathematicians. As perhaps the most influential mathematician of\nhis time, Hilbert, like Russell and Whitehead, believed fervently in the\nmission of rooting all mathematics in a solid logical foundation— _“In der\nMathematik gibt es kein Ignorabimus,”_ he declared. (“In mathematics there is\nno _we will not know_.”) Of course mathematics had many unsolved problems,\nsome quite famous, such as Fermat’s Last Theorem and the Goldbach\nconjecture—statements that seemed true but had not been proved. Had not _yet_\nbeen proved, most people thought. There was an assumption, even a faith, that\nany mathematical truth would be provable, someday.\n\nThe _Entscheidungsproblem_ was to find a rigorous step-by-step procedure by\nwhich, given a formal language of deductive reasoning, one could perform a\nproof automatically. This was Leibniz’s dream revived once again: the\nexpression of all valid reasoning in mechanical rules. Hilbert posed it in the\nform of a question, but he was an optimist. He thought or hoped that he knew\nthe answer. It was just then, at this watershed moment for mathematics and\nlogic, that Gödel threw his incompleteness theorem into the works. In flavor,\nat least, Gödel’s result seemed a perfect antidote to Hilbert’s optimism, as\nit was to Russell’s. But Gödel actually left the _Entscheidungsproblem_\nunanswered. Hilbert had distinguished among three questions:\n\n> Is mathematics complete?\n>\n> Is mathematics consistent?\n>\n> Is mathematics decidable?\n\nGödel showed that mathematics could not be both complete and consistent but\nhad not definitively answered the third question, at least not for all\nmathematics. Even though a particular closed system of formal logic must\ncontain statements that could neither be proved nor disproved from within the\nsystem, it might conceivably be decided, as it were, by an outside referee—by\nexternal logic or rules.*[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1257555)\n\nAlan Turing, just twenty-two years old, unfamiliar with much of the relevant\nliterature, so alone in his work habits that his professor worried about his\nbecoming “a confirmed solitary,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1256895) posed\nan entirely different question (it seemed): Are all numbers computable? This\nwas an unexpected question to begin with, because hardly anyone had considered\nthe idea of an _un_ computable number. Most numbers that people work with, or\nthink about, are computable by definition. The rational numbers are computable\nbecause they can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, _a_ /_b_. The\nalgebraic numbers are computable because they are solutions of polynomial\nequations. Famous numbers like Π and _e_ are computable; people compute them\nall the time. Nonetheless Turing made the seemingly mild statement that\nnumbers might exist that are somehow nameable, definable, and _not_\ncomputable.\n\nWhat did this mean? He defined a computable number as one whose decimal\nexpression can be calculated by finite means. “The justification,” he said,\n“lies in the fact that the human memory is necessarily\nlimited.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1257159) He also defined _calculation_\nas a mechanical procedure, an algorithm. Humans solve problems with intuition,\nimagination, flashes of insight—arguably nonmechanical calculation, or then\nagain perhaps just computation whose steps are hidden. Turing needed to\neliminate the ineffable. He asked, quite literally, what would a machine do?\n“According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be\nwritten down by a machine.”\n\nNo actual machine offered a relevant model. “Computers” were, as ever, people.\nNearly all the world’s computation was still performed through the act of\nwriting marks on paper. Turing did have one information machine for a starting\npoint: the typewriter. As an eleven-year-old sent to boarding school he had\nimagined inventing one. “You see,” he wrote to his parents, “the funny little\nrounds are letters cut out on one side slide along to the round\n![](images/00040.jpg) along an ink pad and stamp down and make the letter,\nthats not nearly all though.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1257896) Of\ncourse, a typewriter is not automatic; it is more a tool than a machine. It\ndoes not flow a stream of language onto the page; rather, the page shifts its\nposition space by space under the hammer, where one character is laid down\nafter another. With this model in mind, Turing imagined another kind of\nmachine, of the utmost purity and simplicity. Being imaginary, it was\nunencumbered by the real-world details one would need for a blueprint, an\nengineering specification, or a patent application. Turing, like Babbage,\nmeant his machine to compute numbers, but he had no need to worry about the\nlimitations of iron and brass. Turing did not plan ever to build his machine.\n\nHe listed the very few items his machine must possess: tape, symbols, and\nstates. Each of these required definition.\n\n_Tape_ is to the Turing machine what paper is to a typewriter. But where a\ntypewriter uses two dimensions of its paper, the machine uses only one—thus, a\ntape, a long strip, divided into squares. “In elementary arithmetic the two-\ndimensional character of the paper is sometimes used,” he wrote. “But such a\nuse is always avoidable, and I think that it will be agreed that the two-\ndimensional character of paper is no essential of\ncomputation.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1258265) The tape is to be thought\nof as infinite: there is always more when needed. But just one square is “in\nthe machine” at any given time. The tape (or the machine) can move left or\nright, to the next square.\n\n_Symbols_ can be written onto the tape, one per square. How many symbols could\nbe used? This required some thought, especially to make sure the number was\nfinite. Turing observed that words—in European languages, at least—behaved as\nindividual symbols. Chinese, he said, “attempts to have an enumerable infinity\nof symbols.” Arabic numerals might also be considered infinite, if 17 and\n999,999,999,999,999 were treated as single symbols, but he preferred to treat\nthem as compound: “It is always possible to use sequences of symbols in the\nplace of single symbols.” In fact, in keeping with the machine’s minimalist\nspirit, he favored the absolute minimum of two symbols: binary notation,\nzeroes and ones. Symbols were not only to be written but also read from the\ntape—“scanned” was the word Turing used. In reality, of course, no technology\ncould yet scan symbols written on paper back into a machine, but there were\nequivalents: for example, punched cards, now used in tabulating machines.\nTuring specified one more limitation: the machine is “aware” (only the\nanthropomorphic word would do) of one symbol at a time—the one on the square\nthat is in the machine.\n\n_States_ required more explaining. Turing used the word “configurations” and\npointed out that these resembled “states of mind.” The machine has a few of\nthese—some finite number. In any given state, the machine takes one or more\nactions depending on the current symbol. For example, in state _a_ , the\nmachine might move one square to the right if the current symbol is 1, or move\none square to the left if the current symbol is 0, or print 1 if the current\nsymbol is blank. In state _b_ , the machine might erase the current symbol. In\nstate _c_ , if the symbol is 0 or 1, the machine might move to the right, and\notherwise stop. After each action, the machine finishes in a new state, which\nmight be the same or different. The various states used for a given\ncalculation were stored in a table—how this was to be managed physically did\nnot matter. The state table was, in effect, the machine’s set of instructions.\n\nAnd this was all.\n\nTuring was _programming_ his machine, though he did not yet use that word.\nFrom the primitive actions—moving, printing, erasing, changing state, and\nstopping—larger processes were built up, and these were used again and again:\n“copying down sequences of symbols, comparing sequences, erasing all symbols\nof a given form, etc.” The machine can see just one symbol at a time, but can\nin effect use parts of the tape to store information temporarily. As Turing\nput it, “Some of the symbols written down … are just rough notes ‘to assist\nthe memory.’ ” The tape, unfurling to the horizon and beyond, provides an\nunbounded record. In this way all arithmetic lies within the machine’s grasp.\nTuring showed how to add a pair of numbers—that is, he wrote out the necessary\ntable of states. He showed how to make the machine print out (endlessly) the\nbinary representation of Π. He spent considerable time working out what the\nmachine could do and how it would accomplish particular tasks. He demonstrated\nthat this short list covers everything a person does in computing a number. No\nother knowledge or intuition is necessary. Anything computable can be computed\nby this machine.\n\nThen came the final flourish. Turing’s machines, stripped down to a finite\ntable of states and a finite set of input, could themselves be represented as\nnumbers. Every possible state table, combined with its initial tape,\nrepresents a different machine. Each machine itself, then, can be described by\na particular number—a certain state table combined with its initial tape.\nTuring was encoding his machines just as Gödel had encoded the language of\nsymbolic logic. This obliterated the distinction between data and\ninstructions: in the end they were all numbers. For every computable number,\nthere must be a corresponding machine number.\n\nTuring produced (still in his mind’s eye) a version of the machine that could\nsimulate every other possible machine—every digital computer. He called this\nmachine _U_ , for “universal,” and mathematicians fondly use the name _U_ to\nthis day. It takes machine numbers as input. That is, it reads the\ndescriptions of other machines from its tape—their algorithms and their own\ninput. No matter how complex a digital computer may grow, its description can\nstill be encoded on tape to be read by _U_. If a problem can be solved by any\ndigital computer—encoded in symbols and solved algorithmically—the universal\nmachine can solve it as well.\n\nNow the microscope is turned onto itself. The Turing machine sets about\nexamining every number to see whether it corresponds to a computable\nalgorithm. Some will prove computable. Some might prove uncomputable. And\nthere is a third possibility, the one that most interested Turing. Some\nalgorithms might defy the inspector, causing the machine to march along,\nperforming its inscrutable business, never coming to a halt, never obviously\nrepeating itself, and leaving the logical observer forever in the dark about\nwhether it _would_ halt.\n\nBy now Turing’s argument, as published in 1936, has become a knotty\nmasterpiece of recursive definitions, symbols invented to represent other\nsymbols, numbers standing in for numbers, for state tables, for algorithms,\nfor machines. In print it looked like this:\n\n> > By combining the machines **_D_** and **_U_** we could construct a machine\n> **_M_** to compute the sequence _β′_. The machine **_D_** may require a\n> tape. We may suppose that it uses the _E_ -squares beyond all symbols on _F_\n> -squares, and that when it has reached its verdict all the rough work done\n> by **_D_** is erased.…\n>\n\n>> We can show further that _there can be no machine_ **_E_** _which, when\napplied with the S.D of an arbitrary machine_ **_M_** , will determine whether\n**_M_** ever prints a given symbol (0 say).\n\nFew could follow it. It seems paradoxical—it _is_ paradoxical—but Turing\nproved that some numbers are uncomputable. (In fact, most are.)\n\nAlso, because every number corresponds to an encoded proposition of\nmathematics and logic, Turing had resolved Hilbert’s question about whether\nevery proposition is decidable. He had proved that the _Entscheidungsproblem_\nhas an answer, and the answer is no. An uncomputable number is, in effect, an\nundecidable proposition.\n\nSo Turing’s computer—a fanciful, abstract, wholly imaginary machine—led him to\na proof parallel to Gödel’s. Turing went further than Gödel by defining the\ngeneral concept of a formal system. Any mechanical procedure for generating\nformulas is essentially a Turing machine. _Any_ formal system, therefore, must\nhave undecidable propositions. Mathematics is not decidable. Incompleteness\nfollows from uncomputability.\n\nOnce again, the paradoxes come to life when numbers gain the power to encode\nthe machine’s own behavior. That is the necessary recursive twist. The entity\nbeing reckoned is fatally entwined with the entity doing the reckoning. As\nDouglas Hofstadter put it much later, “The thing hinges on getting this\nhalting inspector to try to predict its own behavior when looking at itself\ntrying to predict its own behavior when looking at itself trying to predict\nits own behavior when …”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1258533) A conundrum\nthat at least smelled similar had lately appeared in physics, too: Werner\nHeisenberg’s new uncertainty principle. When Turing learned about that, he\nexpressed it in terms of self-reference: “It used to be supposed in Science\nthat if everything was known about the Universe at any particular moment then\nwe can predict what it will be through all the future.… More modern science\nhowever has come to the conclusion that when we are dealing with atoms and\nelectrons we are quite unable to know the exact state of them; our instruments\nbeing made of atoms and electrons\nthemselves.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1258929)\n\nA century had passed between Babbage’s Analytical Engine and Turing’s\nUniversal Machine—a grand and unwieldy contraption and an elegant unreal\nabstraction. Turing never even tried to be a machinist. “One can picture an\nindustrious and diligent clerk, well supplied with scratch paper, tirelessly\nfollowing his instructions,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1259214) as the\nmathematician and logician Herbert Enderton remarked years later. Like Ada\nLovelace, Turing was a programmer, looking inward to the step-by-step logic of\nhis own mind. He imagined himself as a computer. He distilled mental\nprocedures into their smallest constituent parts, the atoms of information\nprocessing.\n\nAlan Turing and Claude Shannon had codes in common. Turing encoded\ninstructions as numbers. He encoded decimal numbers as zeroes and ones.\nShannon made codes for genes and chromosomes and relays and switches. Both men\napplied their ingenuity to mapping one set of objects onto another: logical\noperators and electric circuits; algebraic functions and machine instructions.\nThe play of symbols and the idea of _mapping_ , in the sense of finding a\nrigorous correspondence between two sets, had a prominent place in their\nmental arsenals. This kind of coding was not meant to obscure but to\nilluminate: to discover that apples and oranges were after all equivalent, or\nif not equivalent then fungible. The war brought both men to cryptography in\nits most riddling forms.\n\nTuring’s mother often asked him what use his mathematics had, and he told her\nas early as 1936 that he had discovered a possible application: “a lot of\nparticular and interesting codes.” He added, “I expect I could sell them to H.\nM. Government for quite a substantial sum, but am rather doubtful about the\nmorality of such things.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1259570) Indeed, a\nTuring machine could _make_ ciphers. But His Majesty’s Government turned out\nto have a different problem. As war loomed, the task of reading messages\nintercepted from German cable and wireless traffic fell to the Government Code\nand Cypher School, originally part of the Admiralty, with a staff at first\ncomposed of linguists, clerks, and typists, but no mathematicians. Turing was\nrecruited in the summer of 1938. When the Code and Cypher School evacuated\nfrom London to Bletchley Park, a country mansion in Buckinghamshire, he went\nalong with a team that also included some champions at chess and crossword-\npuzzle solving. It was clear now that classical language scholarship had\nlittle to contribute to cryptanalysis.\n\nThe German system, named Enigma, employed a polyalphabetic cipher implemented\nby a rotor machine the size of a suitcase, with a typewriter keyboard and\nsignal lamps. The cipher had evolved from a famous ancestor, the Vigenère\ncipher, thought to be unbreakable until Charles Babbage cracked it in 1854,\nand Babbage’s mathematical insight gave Bletchley early help, as did work by\nPolish cryptographers who had the first hard years of experience with the\nWehrmacht’s signal traffic. Working from a warren known as Hut 8, Turing took\nthe theoretical lead and solved the problem, not just mathematically but\nphysically.\n\nThis meant building a machine to invert the enciphering of any number of\nEnigmas. Where his first machine was a phantasm of hypothetical tape, this\none, dubbed the Bombe, filled ninety cubic feet with a ton of wire and metal\nleaking oil and effectively mapping the rotors of the German device onto\nelectric circuitry. The scientific triumph at Bletchley—secret for the\nduration of the war and for thirty years after—had a greater effect on the\noutcome than even the Manhattan Project, the real bomb. By the war’s end, the\nTuring Bombes were deciphering thousands of military intercepts every day:\nprocessing information, that is, on a scale never before seen.\n\n![](images/00041.jpg)\n\nA CAPTURED ENIGMA MACHINE [(Illustration credit\n7.1)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1934550)\n\nAlthough nothing of this passed between Turing and Shannon when they met for\nmeals at Bell Labs, they did talk indirectly about a notion of Turing’s about\nhow to measure all this _stuff_. He had watched analysts weigh the messages\npassing through Bletchley, some uncertain and some contradictory, as they\ntried to assess the probability of some fact—a particular Enigma code setting,\nfor example, or the location of a submarine. He felt that something here\nneeded measuring, mathematically. It was not the probability, which would\ntraditionally be expressed as an odds ratio (such as three to two) or a number\nfrom zero to one (such as 0.6, or 60 percent). Rather, Turing cared about the\ndata that _changed_ the probability: a probability factor, something like the\nweight of evidence. He invented a unit he named a “ban.” He found it\nconvenient to use a logarithmic scale, so that bans would be added rather than\nmultiplied. With a base of ten, a ban was the weight of evidence needed to\nmake a fact ten times as likely. For more fine-grained measurement there were\n“decibans” and “centibans.”\n\nShannon had a notion along similar lines.\n\nWorking in the old West Village headquarters, he developed theoretical ideas\nabout cryptography that helped him focus the dream he had intimated to\nVannevar Bush: his “analysis of some of the fundamental properties of general\nsystems for the transmission of intelligence.” He followed parallel tracks all\nduring the war, showing his supervisors the cryptography work and concealing\nthe rest. Concealment was the order of the day. In the realm of pure\nmathematics, Shannon treated some of the same ciphering systems that Turing\nwas attacking with real intercepts and brute hardware—for example, the\nspecific question of the safety of Vigenère cryptograms when “the enemy knows\nthe system being used.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1259853) (The Germans\nwere using just such cryptograms, and the British were the enemy who knew the\nsystem.) Shannon was looking at the most general cases, all involving, as he\nput it, “discrete information.” That meant sequences of symbols, chosen from a\nfinite set, mainly letters of the alphabet but also words of a language and\neven “quantized speech,” voice signals broken into packets with different\namplitude levels. To conceal these meant substituting wrong symbols for the\nright ones, according to some systematic procedure in which a _key_ is known\nto the receiver of the message, who can use it to reverse the substitutions. A\nsecure system works even when the enemy knows the procedure, as long as the\nkey remains secret.\n\nThe code breakers see a stream of data that looks like junk. They want to find\nthe real signal. “From the point of view of the cryptanalyst,” Shannon noted,\n“a secrecy system is almost identical with a noisy communication\nsystem.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1260225) (He completed his report, “A\nMathematical Theory of Cryptography,” in 1945; it was immediately classified.)\nThe data stream is meant to look stochastic, or random, but of course it is\nnot: if it were truly random the signal would be lost. The cipher must\ntransform a patterned thing, ordinary language, into something apparently\nwithout pattern. But pattern is surprisingly persistent. To analyze and\ncategorize the transformations of ciphering, Shannon had to understand the\npatterns of language in a way that scholars—linguists, for example—had never\ndone before. Linguists had, however, begun to focus their discipline on\nstructure in language—system to be found amid the vague billowing shapes and\nsounds. The linguist Edward Sapir wrote of “symbolic atoms” formed by a\nlanguage’s underlying phonetic patterns. “The mere sounds of speech,” he wrote\nin 1921, “are not the essential fact of language, which lies rather in the\nclassification, in the formal patterning.… Language, as a structure, is on its\ninner face the mold of thought.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1260424) _Mold\nof thought_ was exquisite. Shannon, however, needed to view language in terms\nmore tangible and countable.\n\nPattern, as he saw it, equals redundancy. In ordinary language, redundancy\nserves as an aid to understanding. In cryptanalysis, that same redundancy is\nthe Achilles’ heel. Where is this redundancy? As a simple example in English,\nwherever the letter _q_ appears, the _u_ that follows is redundant. (Or\nalmost—it would be entirely redundant were it not for rare borrowed items like\n_qin_ and _Qatar_.) After _q_ , a _u_ is expected. There is no surprise. It\ncontributes no information. After the letter _t_ , an _h_ has a certain amount\nof redundancy, because it is the likeliest letter to appear. Every language\nhas a certain statistical structure, Shannon argued, and with it a certain\nredundancy. Let us call this (he suggested) _D_. “ _D_ measures, in a sense,\nhow much a text in the language can be reduced in length without losing any\ninformation.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1260705)\n\nShannon estimated that English has redundancy of about 50 percent.* Without\ncomputers to process masses of text, he could not be sure, but his estimate\nproved correct. Typical passages can be shortened by half without loss of\ninformation. (_If u cn rd ths_ …) With the simplest early substitution\nciphers, this redundancy provided the point of first weakness. Edgar Allan Poe\nknew that when a cryptogram contained more _z_ ’s than any other letter, then\n_z_ was probably the substitute for _e_ , since _e_ is the most frequent\nletter in English. As soon as _q_ was solved, so was _u_. A code breaker\nlooked for recurring patterns that might match common words or letter\ncombinations: _the, and, -tion_. To perfect this kind of frequency analysis,\ncode breakers needed better information about letter frequencies than Alfred\nVail or Samuel Morse had been able to get by examining printers’ type trays,\nand anyway, more clever ciphers overcame this weakness, by constantly varying\nthe substitution alphabet, so that every letter had many possible substitutes.\nThe obvious, recognizable patterns vanished. But as long as a cryptogram\nretained any trace of patterning—any form or sequence or statistical\nregularity—a mathematician could, in theory, find a way in.\n\nWhat all secrecy systems had in common was the use of a key: a code word, or\nphrase, or an entire book, or something even more complex, but in any case a\nsource of characters known to both the sender and receiver—knowledge shared\napart from the message itself. In the German Enigma system, the key was\ninternalized in hardware and changed daily; Bletchley Park had to rediscover\nit anew each time, its experts sussing out the patterns of language freshly\ntransformed. Shannon, meanwhile, removed himself to the most distant, most\ngeneral, most theoretical vantage point. A secrecy system comprised a finite\n(though possibly very large) number of possible messages, a finite number of\npossible cryptograms, and in between, transforming one to the other, a finite\nnumber of keys, each with an associated probability. This was his schematic\ndiagram:\n\n![](images/00042.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 7.2)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1934675)\n\nThe enemy and the recipient are trying to arrive at the same target: the\nmessage. By framing it this way, in terms of mathematics and probabilities,\nShannon had utterly abstracted the idea of the message from its physical\ndetails. Sounds, waveforms, all the customary worries of a Bell Labs\nengineer—none of these mattered. The message was seen as a choice: one\nalternative selected from a set. At Old North Church the night of Paul\nRevere’s ride, the number of possible messages was two. Nowadays the numbers\nwere almost uncountable—but still susceptible to statistical analysis.\n\nStill in the dark about the very real and utterly relevant experience at\nBletchley Park, Shannon built an edifice of algebraic methods, theorems, and\nproofs that gave cryptologists what they had never before possessed: a\nrigorous way of assessing the security of any secrecy system. He established\nthe scientific principles of cryptography. Among other things, he proved that\nperfect ciphers were possible—“perfect” meaning that even an infinitely long\ncaptured message would not help a code breaker (“the enemy is no better off\nafter intercepting any amount of material than\nbefore”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1261040)). But as he gave, so he took\naway, because he also proved that the requirements were so severe as to make\nthem practically useless. In a perfect cipher, all keys must be equally\nlikely, in effect, a random stream of characters; each key can be used only\nonce; and, worst of all, each key must be as long as the entire message.\n\nAlso in this secret paper, almost in passing, Shannon used a phrase he had\nnever used before: “information theory.”\n\nFirst Shannon had to eradicate “meaning.” The germicidal quotation marks were\nhis. “The ‘meaning’ of a message is generally irrelevant,” he proposed\ncheerfully.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1261222)\n\nHe offered this provocation in order to make his purpose utterly clear.\nShannon needed, if he were to create a theory, to hijack the word\n_information_. “ ‘Information’ here,” he wrote, “although related to the\neveryday meaning of the word, should not be confused with it.” Like Nyquist\nand Hartley before him, he wished to leave aside “the psychological factors”\nand focus only on “the physical.” But if information was divorced from\nsemantic content, what was left? A few things could be said, and at first\nblush they all sounded paradoxical. Information is uncertainty, surprise,\ndifficulty, and entropy:\n\n  * “Information is closely associated with uncertainty.” Uncertainty, in turn, can be measured by counting the number of possible messages. If only one message is possible, there is no uncertainty and thus no information.\n  * Some messages may be likelier than others, and information implies surprise. Surprise is a way of talking about probabilities. If the letter following _t_ (in English) is _h_ , not so much information is conveyed, because the probability of _h_ was relatively high.\n  * “What is significant is the difficulty in transmitting the message from one point to another.” Perhaps this seemed backward, or tautological, like defining mass in terms of the force needed to move an object. But then, mass _can_ be defined that way.\n  * Information is entropy. This was the strangest and most powerful notion of all. Entropy—already a difficult and poorly understood concept—is a measure of disorder in thermodynamics, the science of heat and energy.\n\nFire control and cryptography aside, Shannon had been pursuing this haze of\nideas all through the war. Living alone in a Greenwich Village apartment, he\nseldom socialized with his colleagues, who mainly worked now in the New Jersey\nheadquarters, while Shannon preferred the old West Street hulk. He did not\nhave to explain himself. His war work got him deferred from military service\nand the deferment continued after the war ended. Bell Labs was a rigorously\nmale enterprise, but in wartime the computing group, especially, badly needed\ncompetent staff and began hiring women, among them Betty Moore, who had grown\nup on Staten Island. It was like a typing pool for math majors, she thought.\nAfter a year she was promoted to the microwave research group, in the former\nNabisco building—the “cracker factory”—across West Street from the main\nbuilding. The group designed tubes on the second floor and built them on the\nfirst floor and every so often Claude wandered over to visit. He and Betty\nbegan dating in 1948 and married early in 1949. Just then he was the scientist\neveryone was talking about.\n\n![](images/00043.jpg)\n\nTHE WEST STREET HEADQUARTERS OF BELL LABORATORIES, WITH TRAINS OF THE HIGH\nLINE RUNNING THROUGH\n\nFew libraries carried _The Bell System Technical Journal_ , so researchers\nheard about “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” the traditional way, by\nword of mouth, and obtained copies the traditional way, by writing directly to\nthe author for an offprint. Many scientists used preprinted postcards for such\nrequests, and these arrived in growing volume over the next year. Not everyone\nunderstood the paper. The mathematics was difficult for many engineers, and\nmathematicians meanwhile lacked the engineering context. But Warren Weaver,\nthe director of natural sciences for the Rockefeller Foundation uptown, was\nalready telling his president that Shannon had done for communication theory\n“what Gibbs did for physical\nchemistry.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1261626) Weaver had headed the\ngovernment’s applied mathematics research during the war, supervising the\nfire-control project as well as nascent work in electronic calculating\nmachines. In 1949 he wrote up an appreciative and not too technical essay\nabout Shannon’s theory for _Scientific American_ , and late that year the two\npieces—Weaver’s essay and Shannon’s monograph—were published together as a\nbook, now titled with a grander first word _The Mathematical Theory of\nCommunication_. To John Robinson Pierce, the Bell Labs engineer who had been\nwatching the simultaneous gestation of the transistor and Shannon’s paper, it\nwas the latter that “came as a bomb, and something of a delayed action\nbomb.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1261907)\n\nWhere a layman might have said that the fundamental problem of communication\nis to make oneself understood—to convey meaning—Shannon set the stage\ndifferently:\n\n> > The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one\n> point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another\n> point.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1262226)\n\n“Point” was a carefully chosen word: the origin and destination of a message\ncould be separated in space or in time; information storage, as in a\nphonograph record, counts as a communication. Meanwhile, the message is not\ncreated; it is selected. It is a choice. It might be a card dealt from a deck,\nor three decimal digits chosen from the thousand possibilities, or a\ncombination of words from a fixed code book. He could hardly overlook meaning\naltogether, so he dressed it with a scientist’s definition and then showed it\nthe door:\n\n> > Frequently the messages have _meaning;_ that is they refer to or are\n> correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual\n> entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the\n> engineering problem.\n\nNonetheless, as Weaver took pains to explain, this was not a narrow view of\ncommunication. On the contrary, it was all-encompassing: “not only written and\noral speech, but also music, the pictorial arts, the theatre, the ballet, and\nin fact all human behavior.” Nonhuman as well: why should machines not have\nmessages to send?\n\nShannon’s model for communication fit a simple diagram—essentially the same\ndiagram, by no coincidence, as in his secret cryptography paper.\n\n![](images/00044.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 7.3)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1935011)\n\nA communication system must contain the following elements:\n\n  * The information source is the person or machine generating the message, which may be simply a sequence of characters, as in a telegraph or teletype, or may be expressed mathematically as functions— _f_(_x_ , _y_ , _t_)—of time and other variables. In a complex example like color television, the components are three functions in a three-dimensional continuum, Shannon noted.\n  * The transmitter “operates on the message in some way”—that is, _encodes_ the message—to produce a suitable signal. A telephone converts sound pressure into analog electric current. A telegraph encodes characters in dots, dashes, and spaces. More complex messages may be sampled, compressed, quantized, and interleaved.\n  * The channel: “merely the medium used to transmit the signal.”\n  * The receiver inverts the operation of the transmitter. It decodes the message, or reconstructs it from the signal.\n  * The destination “is the person (or thing)” at the other end.\n\nIn the case of ordinary speech, these elements are the speaker’s brain, the\nspeaker’s vocal cords, the air, the listener’s ear, and the listener’s brain.\n\nAs prominent as the other elements in Shannon’s diagram—because for an\nengineer it is inescapable—is a box labeled “Noise Source.” This covers\neverything that corrupts the signal, predictably or unpredictably: unwanted\nadditions, plain errors, random disturbances, static, “atmospherics,”\ninterference, and distortion. An unruly family under any circumstances, and\nShannon had two different types of systems to deal with, continuous and\ndiscrete. In a discrete system, message and signal take the form of individual\ndetached symbols, such as characters or digits or dots and dashes. Telegraphy\nnotwithstanding, continuous systems of waves and functions were the ones\nfacing electrical engineers every day. Every engineer, when asked to push more\ninformation through a channel, knew what to do: boost the power. Over long\ndistances, however, this approach was failing, because amplifying a signal\nagain and again leads to a crippling buildup of noise.\n\nShannon sidestepped this problem by treating the signal as a string of\ndiscrete symbols. Now, instead of boosting the power, a sender can overcome\nnoise by using extra symbols for error correction—just as an African drummer\nmakes himself understood across long distances, not by banging the drums\nharder, but by expanding the verbosity of his discourse. Shannon considered\nthe discrete case to be more fundamental in a mathematical sense as well. And\nhe was considering another point: that treating messages as discrete had\napplication not just for traditional communication but for a new and rather\nesoteric subfield, the theory of computing machines.\n\nSo back he went to the telegraph. Analyzed precisely, the telegraph did not\nuse a language with just two symbols, dot and dash. In the real world\ntelegraphers used dot (one unit of “line closed” and one unit of “line open”),\ndash (three units, say, of line closed and one unit of line open), and also\ntwo distinct spaces: a letter space (typically three units of line open) and a\nlonger space separating words (six units of line open). These four symbols\nhave unequal status and probability. For example, a space can never follow\nanother space, whereas a dot or dash can follow anything. Shannon expressed\nthis in terms of _states_. The system has two states: in one, a space was the\nprevious symbol and only a dot or dash is allowed, and the state then changes;\nin the other, any symbol is allowed, and the state changes only if a space is\ntransmitted. He illustrated this as a graph:\n\n![](images/00045.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 7.4)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1935225)\n\nThis was far from a simple, binary system of encoding. Nonetheless Shannon\nshowed how to derive the correct equations for information content and channel\ncapacity. More important, he focused on the effect of the statistical\nstructure of the language of the message. The very existence of this\nstructure—the greater frequency of _e_ than _q_ , of _th_ than _xp_ , and so\nforth—allows for a saving of time or channel capacity.\n\n> > This is already done to a limited extent in telegraphy by using the\n> shortest channel sequence, a dot, for the most common English letter E;\n> while the infrequent letters, Q, X, Z are represented by longer sequences of\n> dots and dashes. This idea is carried still further in certain commercial\n> codes where common words and phrases are represented by four- or five-letter\n> code groups with a considerable saving in average time. The standardized\n> greeting and anniversary telegrams now in use extend this to the point of\n> encoding a sentence or two into a relatively short sequence of\n> numbers.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1262552)\n\nTo illuminate the structure of the message Shannon turned to some methodology\nand language from the physics of stochastic processes, from Brownian motion to\nstellar dynamics. (He cited a landmark 1943 paper by the astrophysicist\nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in _Reviews of Modern\nPhysics_.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1262748)) A stochastic process is\nneither deterministic (the next event can be calculated with certainty) nor\nrandom (the next event is totally free). It is governed by a set of\nprobabilities. Each event has a probability that depends on the state of the\nsystem and perhaps also on its previous history. If for _event_ we substitute\n_symbol_ , then a natural written language like English or Chinese is a\nstochastic process. So is digitized speech; so is a television signal.\n\nLooking more deeply, Shannon examined statistical structure in terms of how\nmuch of a message influences the probability of the next symbol. The answer\ncould be none: each symbol has its own probability but does not depend on what\ncame before. This is the first-order case. In the second-order case, the\nprobability of each symbol depends on the symbol immediately before, but not\non any others. Then each two-character combination, or digram, has its own\nprobability: _th_ greater than _xp_ , in English. In the third-order case, one\nlooks at trigrams, and so forth. Beyond that, in ordinary text, it makes sense\nto look at the level of words rather than individual characters, and many\ntypes of statistical facts come into play. Immediately after the word _yellow_\n, some words have a higher probability than usual and others virtually zero.\nAfter the word _an_ , words beginning with consonants become exceedingly rare.\nIf the letter _u_ ends a word, the word is probably _you._ If two consecutive\nletters are the same, they are probably _ll, ee, ss_ , or _oo_. And structure\ncan extend over long distances: in a message containing the word _cow_ , even\nafter many other characters intervene, the word _cow_ is relatively likely to\noccur again. As is the word _horse_. A message, as Shannon saw, can behave\nlike a dynamical system whose future course is conditioned by its past\nhistory.\n\nTo illustrate the differences between these different orders of structure, he\nwrote down—computed, really—a series of “approximations” of English text. He\nused an alphabet of twenty-seven characters, the letters plus a space between\nwords, and generated strings of characters with the help of a table of random\nnumbers. (These he drew from a book newly published for such purposes by\nCambridge University Press: 100,000 digits for three shillings nine pence, and\nthe authors “have furnished a guarantee of the random\narrangement.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1263022)) Even with random numbers\npresupplied, working out the sequences was painstaking. The sample texts\nlooked like this:\n\n  * “Zero-order approximation”—that is, random characters, no structure or correlations.\n\n> XFOML RXKHRJFFJUJ ZLPWCFWKCYJ\n>\n> FFJEYVKCQSGHYD GPAAMKBZAACIBZLHJGD.\n\n  * First order—each character is independent of the rest, but the frequencies are those expected in English: more _e_ ’s and _t_ ’s, fewer _z_ ’s and _j_ ’s, and the word lengths look realistic.\n\n> OCRO HLI RGWR NIMILWIS EU LL NBNESEBYA\n>\n> TH EEI ALHENHTTPA OOBTTVA NAH BRL.\n\n  * Second order—the frequencies of each character match English and so also do the frequencies of each digram, or letter pair. (Shannon found the necessary statistics in tables constructed for use by code breakers.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1264483) The most common digram in English is _th_ , with a frequency of 168 per thousand words, followed by _he, an, re_ , and _er_. Quite a few digrams have zero frequency.)\n\n> ON IE ANTSOUTINYS ARE T INCTORE ST BE S DEAMY ACHIN\n>\n> D ILONASIVE TUCOOWE AT TEASONARE FUSO TIZIN ANDY\n>\n> TOBESEACE CTISBE.\n\n  * Third order—trigram structure.\n\n> IN NO IST LAT WHEY CRATICT FROURE BIRS GROCID\n>\n> PONDENOME OF DEMONSTURES OF THE REPTAGIN IS\n>\n> REGOACTIONA OF CRE.\n\n  * First-order word approximation.\n\n> REPRESENTING AND SPEEDILY IS AN GOOD APT OR COME CAN\n>\n> DIFFERENT NATURAL HERE HE THE A IN CAME THE TO\n>\n> OF TO EXPERT GRAY COME TO FURNISHES THE LINE MESSAGE HAD\n>\n> BE THESE.\n\n  * Second-order word approximation—now pairs of words appear in the expected frequency, so we do not see “a in” or “to of.”\n\n> THE HEAD AND IN FRONTAL ATTACK ON AN ENGLISH\n>\n> WRITER THAT THE CHARACTER OF THIS POINT IS\n>\n> THEREFORE ANOTHER METHOD FOR THE LETTERS THAT\n>\n> THE TIME OF WHO EVER TOLD THE PROBLEM FOR AN\n>\n> UNEXPECTED.\n\nThese sequences increasingly “look” like English. Less subjectively, it turns\nout that touch typists can handle them with increasing speed—another\nindication of the ways people unconsciously internalize a language’s\nstatistical structure.\n\nShannon could have produced further approximations, given enough time, but the\nlabor involved was becoming enormous. The point was to represent a message as\nthe outcome of a process that generated events with discrete probabilities.\nThen what could be said about the amount of information, or the rate at which\ninformation is generated? For each event, the possible choices each have a\nknown probability (represented as _p_ 1, _p_ 2, _p_ 3, and so on). Shannon\nwanted to define the measure of information (represented as _H_) as the\nmeasure of uncertainty: “of how much ‘choice’ is involved in the selection of\nthe event or of how uncertain we are of the\noutcome.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1264770) The probabilities might be\nthe same or different, but generally more choices meant more uncertainty—more\ninformation. Choices might be broken down into successive choices, with their\nown probabilities, and the probabilities had to be additive; for example, the\nprobability of a particular digram should be a weighted sum of the\nprobabilities of the individual symbols. When those probabilities were equal,\nthe amount of information conveyed by each symbol was simply the logarithm of\nthe number of possible symbols—Nyquist and Hartley’s formula:\n\n> _H = n_ log _s_\n\nFor the more realistic case, Shannon reached an elegant solution to the\nproblem of how to measure information as a function of probabilities—an\nequation that summed the probabilities with a logarithmic weighting (base 2\nwas most convenient). It is the average logarithm of the improbability of the\nmessage; in effect, a measure of unexpectedness:\n\n> _H =_ −Σ _p_ _i_ log2 _p_ _i_\n\nwhere _p_ _i_ is the probability of each message. He declared that we would be\nseeing this again and again: that quantities of this form “play a central role\nin information theory as measures of information, choice, and uncertainty.”\nIndeed, _H_ is ubiquitous, conventionally called the entropy of a message, or\nthe Shannon entropy, or, simply, the information.\n\nA new unit of measure was needed. Shannon said: “The resulting units may be\ncalled binary digits, or more briefly,\n_bits_.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1265054) As the smallest possible\nquantity of information, a bit represents the amount of uncertainty that\nexists in the flipping of a coin. The coin toss makes a choice between two\npossibilities of equal likelihood: in this case _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 each equal ½;\nthe base 2 logarithm of ½ is −1; so _H_ = 1 bit. A single character chosen\nrandomly from an alphabet of 32 conveys more information: 5 bits, to be exact,\nbecause there are 32 possible messages and the logarithm of 32 is 5. A string\nof 1,000 such characters carries 5,000 bits—not just by simple multiplication,\nbut because the amount of information represents the amount of uncertainty:\nthe number of possible choices. With 1,000 characters in a 32-character\nalphabet, there are 321000 possible messages, and the logarithm of that number\nis 5,000.\n\nThis is where the statistical structure of natural languages reenters the\npicture. If the thousand-character message is known to be English text, the\nnumber of possible messages is smaller— _much_ smaller. Looking at\ncorrelations extending over eight letters, Shannon estimated that English has\na built-in redundancy of about 50 percent: that each new character of a\nmessage conveys not 5 bits but only about 2.3. Considering longer-range\nstatistical effects, at the level of sentences and paragraphs, he raised that\nestimate to 75 percent—warning, however, that such estimates become “more\nerratic and uncertain, and they depend more critically on the type of text\ninvolved.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1265485) One way to measure\nredundancy was crudely empirical: carry out a psychology test with a human\nsubject. This method “exploits the fact that anyone speaking a language\npossesses, implicitly, an enormous knowledge of the statistics of the\nlanguage.”\n\n> > Familiarity with the words, idioms, clichés and grammar enables him to\n> fill in missing or incorrect letters in proof-reading, or to complete an\n> unfinished phrase in conversation.\n\nHe might have said “her,” because in point of fact his test subject was his\nwife, Betty. He pulled a book from the shelf (it was a Raymond Chandler\ndetective novel, _Pickup on Noon Street_), put his finger on a short passage\nat random, and asked Betty to start guessing the letter, then the next letter,\nthen the next. The more text she saw, of course, the better her chances of\nguessing right. After “A SMALL OBLONG READING LAMP ON THE” she got the next\nletter wrong. But once she knew it was _D ,_ she had no trouble guessing the\nnext three letters. Shannon observed, “The errors, as would be expected, occur\nmost frequently at the beginning of words and syllables where the line of\nthought has more possibility of branching out.”\n\nQuantifying predictability and redundancy in this way is a backward way of\nmeasuring information content. If a letter can be guessed from what comes\nbefore, it is redundant; to the extent that it is redundant, it provides no\nnew information. If English is 75 percent redundant, then a thousand-letter\nmessage in English carries only 25 percent as much information as one thousand\nletters chosen at random. Paradoxical though it sounded, random messages carry\n_more_ information. The implication was that natural-language text could be\nencoded more efficiently for transmission or storage.\n\nShannon demonstrated one way to do this, an algorithm that exploits differing\nprobabilities of different symbols. And he delivered a stunning package of\nfundamental results. One was a formula for channel capacity, the absolute\nspeed limit of any communication channel (now known simply as the Shannon\nlimit). Another was the discovery that, within that limit, it must always be\npossible to devise schemes of error correction that will overcome any level of\nnoise. The sender may have to devote more and more bits to correcting errors,\nmaking transmission slower and slower, but the message will ultimately get\nthrough. Shannon did not show how to design such schemes; he only proved that\nit was possible, thereby inspiring a future branch of computer science. “To\nmake the chance of error as small as you wish? Nobody had thought of that,”\nhis colleague Robert Fano recalled years later. “How he got that insight, how\nhe came to believe such a thing, I don’t know. But almost all modern\ncommunication theory is based on that\nwork.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1265835) Whether removing redundancy to\nincrease efficiency or adding redundancy to enable error correction, the\nencoding depends on knowledge of the language’s statistical structure to do\nthe encoding. Information cannot be separated from probabilities. A bit,\nfundamentally, is always a coin toss.\n\nIf the two sides of a coin were one way of representing a bit, Shannon offered\na more practical hardware example as well:\n\n> > A device with two stable positions, such as a relay or a flip-flop\n> circuit, can store one bit of information. _N_ such devices can store _N_\n> bits, since the total number of possible states is 2 _N_ and log22 _N_ =\n> _N_.\n\nShannon had seen devices—arrays of relays, for example—that could store\nhundreds, even thousands of bits. That seemed like a great many. As he was\nfinishing his write-up, he wandered one day into the office of a Bell Labs\ncolleague, William Shockley, an Englishman in his thirties. Shockley belonged\nto a group of solid-state physicists working on alternatives to vacuum tubes\nfor electronics, and sitting on his desk was a tiny prototype, a piece of\nsemiconducting crystal. “It’s a solid-state amplifier,” Shockley told\nShannon.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1266159) At that point it still needed\na name.\n\nOne day in the summer of 1949, before the book version of _The Mathematical\nTheory of Communication_ appeared, Shannon took a pencil and a piece of\nnotebook paper, drew a line from top to bottom, and wrote the powers of ten\nfrom 100 to 1013. He labeled this axis “bits storage\ncapacity.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1266464) He began listing some items\nthat might be said to “store” information. A digit wheel, of the kind used in\na desktop adding machine—ten decimal digits—represents just over 3 bits. At\njust under 103 bits, he wrote “punched card (all config. allowed).” At 104 he\nput “page single spaced typing (32 possible symbols).” Near 105 he wrote\nsomething offbeat: “genetic constitution of man.” There was no real precedent\nfor this in current scientific thinking. James D. Watson was a twenty-one-\nyear-old student of zoology in Indiana; the discovery of the structure of DNA\nlay several years in the future. This was the first time anyone suggested the\ngenome was an information store measurable in bits. Shannon’s guess was\nconservative, by at least four orders of magnitude. He thought a “phono record\n(128 levels)” held more information: about 300,000 bits. To the 10 million\nlevel he assigned a thick professional journal (_Proceedings of the Institute\nof Radio Engineers_) and to 1 billion the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_. He\nestimated one hour of broadcast television at 1011 bits and one hour of\n“technicolor movie” at more than a trillion. Finally, just under his pencil\nmark for 1014, 100 trillion bits, he put the largest information stockpile he\ncould think of: the Library of Congress.\n\n![](images/00046.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 7.5)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1935440)\n\n* * *\n\n* Toward the end of his life Gödel wrote, “It was only by Turing’s work that it became completely clear, that my proof is applicable to every formal system containing arithmetic.”\n\n* “not considering statistical structure over greater distances than about eight letters.”\n\n\n# 8 | THE INFORMATIONAL TURN\n\n\n##\n\n> (The Basic Ingredient in Building a Mind)\n\n> _It is probably dangerous to use this theory of information in fields for\n> which it was not designed, but I think the danger will not keep people from\n> using it._\n\n> —J. C. R. Licklider (1950)[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1266813)\n\nMOST MATHEMATICAL THEORIES take shape slowly; Shannon’s information theory\nsprang forth like Athena, fully formed. Yet the little book of Shannon and\nWeaver drew scant public attention when it appeared in 1949. The first review\ncame from a mathematician, Joseph L. Doob, who complained that it was more\n“suggestive” than mathematical—“and it is not always clear that the author’s\nmathematical intentions are honorable.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1267238)\nA biology journal said, “At first glance, it might appear that this is\nprimarily an engineering monograph with little or no application to human\nproblems. Actually, the theory has some rather exciting\nimplications.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1267494) _The Philosophical\nReview_ said it would be a mistake for philosophers to overlook this book:\n“Shannon develops a concept of _information_ which, surprisingly enough, turns\nout to be an extension of the thermodynamic concept of\n_entropy_.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1267772) The strangest review was\nbarely a review at all: five paragraphs in _Physics Today_ , September 1950,\nsigned by Norbert Wiener, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nWiener began with a faintly patronizing anecdote:\n\n> > Some fifteen years ago, a very bright young student came to the\n> authorities at MIT with an idea for a theory of electric switching dependent\n> on the algebra of logic. The student was Claude E. Shannon.\n\nIn the present book (Wiener continued), Shannon, along with Warren Weaver,\n“has summed up his views on communication engineering.”\n\nThe fundamental idea developed by Shannon, said Wiener, “is that of the amount\nof information as negative entropy.” He added that he himself—“the author of\nthe present review”—had developed the same idea at about the same time.\n\nWiener declared the book to be work “whose origins were independent of my own\nwork, but which has been bound from the beginning to my investigations by\ncross influences spreading in both directions.” He mentioned “those of us who\nhave tried to pursue this analogy into the study of Maxwell’s demon” and added\nthat much work remained to be done.\n\nThen he suggested that the treatment of language was incomplete without\ngreater emphasis on the human nervous system: “nervous reception and the\ntransmission of language into the brain. I say these things not as a hostile\ncriticism.”\n\nFinally, Wiener concluded with a paragraph devoted to another new book: “my\nown _Cybernetics_.” Both books, he said, represent opening salvos in a field\nthat promises to grow rapidly.\n\n> > In my book, I have taken the privilege of an author to be more\n> speculative, and to cover a wider range than Drs. Shannon and Weaver have\n> chosen to do.… There is not only room, but a definite need for different\n> books.\n\nHe saluted his colleagues for their well-worked and independent approach—to\ncybernetics.\n\nShannon, meanwhile, had already contributed a short review of Wiener’s book to\nthe _Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers_ , offering praise that\ncould be described as faint. It is “an excellent introduction,” he\nsaid.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1268095) There was a little tension\nbetween these men. It could be felt weighing down the long footnote that\nanchored the opening page of Weaver’s portion of _The Mathematical Theory of\nCommunication_ :\n\n> > Dr. Shannon has himself emphasized that communication theory owes a great\n> debt to Professor Norbert Wiener for most of its basic philosophy. Professor\n> Wiener, on the other hand, points out that much of Shannon’s early work on\n> switching and mathematical logic antedated his own interest in this field;\n> and generously adds that Shannon certainly deserves credit for independent\n> development of such fundamental aspects of the theory as the introduction of\n> entropic ideas.\n\nShannon’s colleague John Pierce wrote later: “Wiener’s head was full of his\nown work.… Competent people have told me that Wiener, under the\nmisapprehension that he already knew what Shannon had done, never actually\nfound out.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1268454)\n\n_Cybernetics_ was a coinage, future buzzword, proposed field of study, would-\nbe philosophical movement entirely conceived by this brilliant and prickly\nthinker. The word he took from the Greek for _steersman_ : κυβερνιτησ,\n_kubernites_ , from which comes also (not coincidentally) the word\n_governor_.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1268767) He meant cybernetics to be\na field that would synthesize the study of communication and control, also the\nstudy of human and machine. Norbert Wiener had first become known to the world\nas a curiosity: a sport, a prodigy, driven and promoted by his father, a\nprofessor at Harvard. “A lad who has been proudly termed by his friends the\nbrightest boy in the world,” _The New York Times_ reported on page 1 when he\nwas fourteen years old, “will graduate next month from Tufts College.… Aside\nfrom the fact that Norbert Wiener’s capacity for learning is phenomenal, he is\nas other boys.… His intense black eyes are his most striking\nfeature.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1269059) When he wrote his memoirs, he\nalways used the word _prodigy_ in the titles: _Ex-Prodigy: My Childhood and\nYouth_ and _I Am a Mathematician: The Later Life of a Prodigy_.\n\nAfter Tufts (mathematics), Harvard graduate school (zoology), Cornell\n(philosophy), and Harvard again, Wiener left for Cambridge, England, where he\nstudied symbolic logic and _Principia Mathematica_ with Bertrand Russell\nhimself. Russell was not entirely charmed. “An infant prodigy named Wiener,\nPh.D. (Harvard), aged 18, turned up,” he wrote a friend. “The youth has been\nflattered, and thinks himself God Almighty—there is a perpetual contest\nbetween him and me as to which is to do the\nteaching.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1269324) For his part, Wiener\ndetested Russell: “He is an iceberg. His mind impresses one as a keen, cold,\nnarrow logical machine, that cuts the universe into neat little packets, that\nmeasure, as it were, just three inches each\nway.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1269662) On his return to the United\nStates, Wiener joined the faculty of MIT in 1919, the same year as Vannevar\nBush. When Shannon got there in 1936, he took one of Wiener’s mathematics\ncourses. When war loomed, Wiener was one of the first to join the hidden,\nscattered teams of mathematicians working on antiaircraft fire control.\n\n![](images/00047.jpg)\n\nNORBERT WIENER (1956) [(Illustration credit\n8.1)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1935566)\n\nHe was short and rotund, with heavy glasses and a Mephistophelian goatee.\nWhere Shannon’s fire-control work drilled down to the signal amid the noise,\nWiener stayed with the noise: swarming fluctuations in the radar receiver,\nunpredictable deviations in flight paths. The noise behaved statistically, he\nunderstood, like Brownian motion, the “extremely lively and wholly haphazard\nmovement” that van Leeuwenhoek had observed through his microscope in the\nseventeenth century. Wiener had undertaken a thoroughgoing mathematical\ntreatment of Brownian motion in the 1920s. The very discontinuity appealed to\nhim—not just the particle trajectories but the mathematical functions, too,\nseemed to misbehave. This was, as he wrote, discrete chaos, a term that would\nnot be well understood for several generations. On the fire-control project,\nwhere Shannon made a modest contribution to the Bell Labs team, Wiener and his\ncolleague Julian Bigelow produced a legendary 120-page monograph, classified\nand known to the several dozen people allowed to see it as the Yellow Peril\nbecause of the color of its binder and the difficulty of its treatment. The\nformal title was _Extrapolation, Interpolation, and Smoothing of Stationary\nTime Series_. In it Wiener developed a statistical method for predicting the\nfuture from noisy, uncertain, and corrupted data about the past. It was too\nambitious for the existing gun machinery, but he tested it on Vannevar Bush’s\nDifferential Analyzer. Both the antiaircraft gun, with its operator, and the\ntarget airplane, with its pilot, were hybrids of machine and human. One had to\npredict the behavior of the other.\n\nWiener was as worldly as Shannon was reticent. He was well traveled and\npolyglot, ambitious and socially aware; he took science personally and\npassionately. His expression of the second law of thermodynamics, for example,\nwas a cry of the heart:\n\n> > We are swimming upstream against a great torrent of disorganization, which\n> tends to reduce everything to the heat death of equilibrium and sameness.…\n> This heat death in physics has a counterpart in the ethics of Kierkegaard,\n> who pointed out that we live in a chaotic moral universe. In this, our main\n> obligation is to establish arbitrary enclaves of order and system.… Like the\n> Red Queen, we cannot stay where we are without running as fast as we\n> can.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1270043)\n\nHe was concerned for his place in intellectual history, and he aimed high.\nCybernetics, he wrote in his memoirs, amounted to “a new interpretation of\nman, of man’s knowledge of the universe, and of\nsociety.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1270353) Where Shannon saw himself as\na mathematician and an engineer, Wiener considered himself foremost a\nphilosopher, and from his fire-control work he drew philosophical lessons\nabout purpose and behavior. If one defines behavior cleverly—“any change of an\nentity with respect to its\nsurroundings”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1270537)—then the word can apply\nto machines as well as animals. Behavior directed toward a goal is purposeful,\nand the purpose can sometimes be imputed to the machine rather than a human\noperator: for example, in the case of a target-seeking mechanism. “The term\nservomechanisms has been coined precisely to designate machines with an\nintrinsic purposeful behavior.” The key was control, or self-regulation.\n\nTo analyze it properly he borrowed an obscure term from electrical\nengineering: “feed-back,” the return of energy from a circuit’s output back to\nits input. When feedback is positive, as when the sound from loudspeakers is\nre-amplified through a microphone, it grows wildly out of control. But when\nfeedback is negative—as in the original mechanical governor of steam engines,\nfirst analyzed by James Clerk Maxwell—it can guide a system toward\nequilibrium; it serves as an agent of stability. Feedback can be mechanical:\nthe faster Maxwell’s governor spins, the wider its arms extend, and the wider\nits arms extend, the slower it must spin. Or it can be electrical. Either way,\nthe key to the process is information. What governs the antiaircraft gun, for\nexample, is information about the plane’s coordinates and about the previous\nposition of the gun itself. Wiener’s friend Bigelow emphasized this: “that it\nwas not some particular physical thing such as energy or length or voltage,\nbut only information (conveyed by any\nmeans).”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1270827)\n\nNegative feedback must be ubiquitous, Wiener felt. He could see it at work in\nthe coordination of eye and hand, guiding the nervous system of a person\nperforming an action as ordinary as picking up a pencil. He focused especially\non neurological disorders, maladies that disrupted physical coordination or\nlanguage. He saw them quite specifically as cases of information feedback gone\nawry: varieties of ataxia, for example, where sense messages are either\ninterrupted in the spinal cord or misinterpreted in the cerebellum. His\nanalysis was detailed and mathematical, with equations—almost unheard of in\nneurology. Meanwhile, feedback control systems were creeping into factory\nassembly lines, because a mechanical system, too, can modify its own behavior.\nFeedback is the governor, the steersman.\n\nSo _Cybernetics_ became the title of Wiener’s first book, published in the\nfall of 1948 in both the United States and France. Subtitle: _Control and\nCommunication in the Animal and the Machine_. The book is a hodgepodge of\nnotions and analysis, and, to the astonishment of its publishers, it became\nthe year’s unexpected bestseller. The popular American news magazines, _Time_\nand _Newsweek_ , both featured it. Wiener and cybernetics were identified with\na phenomenon that was bursting into public consciousness just at that moment:\ncomputing machines. With the end of the war, a veil had been lifted from the\nfirst urgent projects in electronic calculation, particularly the ENIAC, a\nthirty-ton monster of vacuum tubes, relays, and hand-soldered wires stretching\nacross eighty feet at the University of Pennsylvania’s electrical engineering\nschool. It could store and multiply up to twenty numbers of ten decimal\ndigits; the army used it to calculate artillery firing tables. The\nInternational Business Machines company, IBM, which provided punched card\nmachines for the army projects, also built a giant calculating machine at\nHarvard, the Mark I. In Britain, still secret, the code breakers at Bletchley\nPark had gone on to build a vacuum-tube computing machine called the Colossus.\nAlan Turing was beginning work on another, at the University of Manchester.\nWhen the public learned about these machines, they were naturally thought of\nas “brains.” Everyone asked the same question: Can machines think?\n\n“They are growing with fearful speed,” declared _Time_ in its year-end issue.\n“They started by solving mathematical equations with flash-of-lightning\nrapidity. Now they are beginning to act like genuine mechanical\nbrains.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1271151) Wiener encouraged the\nspeculation, if not the wild imagery:\n\n> > Dr. Wiener sees no reason why they can’t learn from experience, like\n> monstrous and precocious children racing through grammar school. One such\n> mechanical brain, ripe with stored experience, might run a whole industry,\n> replacing not only mechanics and clerks but many of the executives too.…\n>\n\n>> As men construct better calculating machines, explains Wiener, and as they\nexplore their own brains, the two seem more & more alike. Man, he thinks, is\nrecreating himself, monstrously magnified, in his own image.\n\nMuch of the success of his book, abstruse and ungainly as it was, lay in\nWiener’s always returning his focus to the human, not the machine. He was not\nas interested in shedding light on the rise of computing—to which, in any\ncase, his connections were peripheral—as in how computing might shed light on\nhumanity. He cared profoundly, it turned out, about understanding mental\ndisorders; about mechanical prostheses; and about the social dislocations that\nmight follow the rise of smart machinery. He worried that it would devalue the\nhuman brain as factory machinery had devalued the human hand.\n\nHe developed the human-machine parallels in a chapter titled “Computing\nMachines and the Nervous System.” First he laid out a distinction between two\ntypes of computing machines: analog and digital, though he did not yet use\nthose words. The first type, like the Bush Differential Analyzer, represented\nnumbers as measurements on a continuous scale; they were analogy machines. The\nother kind, which he called numerical machines, represented numbers directly\nand exactly, as desk calculators did. Ideally, these devices would use the\nbinary number system for simplicity. For advanced calculations they would need\nto employ a form of logic. What form? Shannon had answered that question in\nhis master’s thesis of 1937, and Wiener offered the same answer:\n\n> > the algebra of logic _par excellence_ , or the Boolean algebra. This\n> algorithm, like the binary arithmetic, is based on the dichotomy, the choice\n> between _yes_ and _no_ , the choice between being in a class and\n> outside.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1271403)\n\nThe brain, too, he argued, is at least partly a logical machine. Where\ncomputers employ relays—mechanical, or electromechanical, or purely\nelectrical—the brain has neurons. These cells tend to be in one of two states\nat any given moment: active (firing) or at rest (in repose). So they may be\nconsidered relays with two states. They are connected to one another in vast\narrays, at points of contact known as synapses. They transmit messages. To\nstore the messages, brains have memory; computing machines, too, need physical\nstorage that can be called memory. (He knew well that this was a simplified\npicture of a complex system, that other sorts of messages, more analog than\ndigital, seemed to be carried chemically by hormones.) Wiener suggested, too,\nthat functional disorders such as “nervous breakdowns” might have cousins in\nelectronics. Designers of computing machines might need to plan for untimely\nfloods of data—perhaps the equivalent of “traffic problems and overloading in\nthe nervous system.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1271775)\n\nBrains and electronic computers both use quantities of energy in performing\ntheir work of logic—“all of which is wasted and dissipated in heat,” to be\ncarried away by the blood or by ventilating and cooling apparatus. But this is\nreally beside the point, Wiener said. “Information is information, not matter\nor energy. No materialism which does not admit this can survive at the present\nday.”\n\nNow came a time of excitement.\n\n“We are again in one of those prodigious periods of scientific progress—in its\nown way like the pre-Socratic period,” declared the gnomic, white-bearded\nneurophysiologist Warren McCulloch to a meeting of British philosophers. He\ntold them that listening to Wiener and von Neumann put him in mind of the\ndebates of the ancients. A new physics of communication had been born, he\nsaid, and metaphysics would never be the same: “For the first time in the\nhistory of science we know how we know and hence are able to state it\nclearly.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1271964) He offered them heresy: that\nthe knower was a computing machine, the brain composed of relays, perhaps ten\nbillion of them, each receiving signals from other relays and sending them\nonward. The signals are quantized: they either happen or do not happen. So\nonce again the stuff of the world, he said, turns out to be the atoms of\nDemocritus—“indivisibles—leasts—which go batting about in the void.”\n\n> > It is a world for Heraclitus, always “on the move.” I do not mean merely\n> that every relay is itself being momentarily destroyed and re-created like a\n> flame, but I mean that its business is with information which pours into it\n> over many channels, passes through it, eddies within it and emerges again to\n> the world.\n\nThat these ideas were spilling across disciplinary borders was due in large\npart to McCulloch, a dynamo of eclecticism and cross-fertilization. Soon after\nthe war he began organizing a series of conferences at the Beekman Hotel on\nPark Avenue in New York City, with money from the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation,\nendowed in the nineteenth century by heirs of Nantucket whalers. A host of\nsciences were coming of age all at once—so-called social sciences, like\nanthropology and psychology, looking for new mathematical footing; medical\noffshoots with hybrid names, like neurophysiology; not-quite-sciences like\npsychoanalysis—and McCulloch invited experts in all these fields, as well as\nmathematics and electrical engineering. He instituted a Noah’s Ark rule,\ninviting two of each species so that speakers would always have someone\npresent who could see through their\njargon.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1272305) Among the core group were the\nalready famous anthropologist Margaret Mead and her then-husband Gregory\nBateson, the psychologists Lawrence K. Frank and Heinrich Klüver, and that\nformidable, sometimes rivalrous pair of mathematicians, Wiener and von\nNeumann.\n\nMead, recording the proceedings in a shorthand no one else could read, said\nshe broke a tooth in the excitement of the first meeting and did not realize\nit till afterward. Wiener told them that all these sciences, the social\nsciences especially, were fundamentally the study of communication, and that\ntheir unifying idea was the _message_.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1272549)\nThe meetings began with the unwieldy name of Conferences for Circular Causal\nand Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems and then, in\ndeference to Wiener, whose new fame they enjoyed, changed that to Conference\non Cybernetics. Throughout the conferences, it became habitual to use the new,\nawkward, and slightly suspect term _information theory_. Some of the\ndisciplines were more comfortable than others. It was far from clear where\ninformation belonged in their respective worldviews.\n\nThe meeting in 1950, on March 22 and 23, began self-consciously. “The subject\nand the group have provoked a tremendous amount of external interest,” said\nRalph Gerard, a neuroscientist from the University of Chicago’s medical\nschool, “almost to the extent of a national fad. They have prompted extensive\narticles in such well known scientific magazines as _Time, News-Week_ , and\n_Life_.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1272806) He was referring, among\nothers, to _Time_ ’s cover story earlier that winter titled “The Thinking\nMachine” and featuring Wiener:\n\n> > Professor Wiener is a stormy petrel (he looks more like a stormy puffin)\n> of mathematics and adjacent territory.… The great new computers, cried\n> Wiener with mingled alarm and triumph, are … harbingers of a whole new\n> science of communication and control, which he promptly named “cybernetics.”\n> The newest machines, Wiener pointed out, already have an extraordinary\n> resemblance to the human brain, both in structure and function. So far, they\n> have no senses or “effectors” (arms and legs), but why shouldn’t they have?\n\nIt was true, Gerard said, that his field was being profoundly affected by new\nways of thought from communications engineering—helping them think of a nerve\nimpulse not just as a “physical-chemical event” but as a sign or a signal. So\nit was helpful to take lessons from “calculating machines and communications\nsystems,” but it was dangerous, too.\n\n> > To say, as the public press says, that therefore these machines are\n> brains, and that our brains are nothing but calculating machines, is\n> presumptuous. One might as well say that the telescope is an eye or that a\n> bulldozer is a muscle.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1273054)\n\nWiener felt he had to respond. “I have not been able to prevent these\nreports,” he said, “but I have tried to make the publications exercise\nrestraint. I still do not believe that the use of the word ‘thinking’ in them\nis entirely to be\nreprehended.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1273242)*[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1273443)\n\nGerard’s main purpose was to talk about whether the brain, with its mysterious\narchitecture of neurons, branching dendrite trees, and complex\ninterconnections alive within a chemical soup, could properly be described as\nanalog or digital.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1273797) Gregory Bateson\ninstantly interrupted: he still found this distinction confusing. It was a\nbasic question. Gerard owed his own understanding to “the expert tutelage that\nI have received here, primarily from John von Neumann”—who was sitting right\nthere—but Gerard took a stab at it anyway. Analog is a slide rule, where\nnumber is represented as distance; digital is an abacus, where you either\ncount a bead or you do not; there’s nothing in between. A rheostat—light\ndimmer—is analog; a wall switch that snaps on or off, digital. Brain waves and\nneural chemistry, said Gerard, are analog.\n\nDiscussion ensued. Von Neumann had plenty to say. He had lately been\ndeveloping a “game theory,” which he viewed effectively as a mathematics of\nincomplete information. And he was taking the lead in designing an\narchitecture for the new electronic computers. He wanted the more analog-\nminded of the group to think more abstractly—to recognize that digital\nprocesses take place in a messy, continuous world but are digital nonetheless.\nWhen a neuron snaps between two possible states—“the state of the nerve cell\nwith no message in it and the state of the cell with a message in\nit”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1274052)—the chemistry of this transition\nmay have intermediate shadings, but for theoretical purposes the shadings may\nbe ignored. In the brain, he suggested, just as in a computer made of vacuum\ntubes, “these discrete actions are in reality simulated on the background of\ncontinuous processes.” McCulloch had just put this neatly in a new paper\ncalled “Of Digital Computers Called Brains”: “In this world it seems best to\nhandle even apparent continuities as some numbers of some little\nsteps.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1274257) Remaining quiet in the audience\nwas the new man in the group, Claude Shannon.\n\nThe next speaker was J. C. R. Licklider, an expert on speech and sound from\nthe new Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory at Harvard, known to everyone as Lick. He\nwas another young scientist with his feet in two different worlds—part\npsychologist and part electrical engineer. Later that year he moved to MIT,\nwhere he established a new psychology department within the department of\nelectrical engineering. He was working on an idea for quantizing speech—taking\nspeech waves and reducing them to the smallest quantities that could be\nreproduced by a “flip-flop circuit,” a homemade gadget made from twenty-five\ndollars of vacuum tubes, resistors, and\ncapacitors.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1274571) It was surprising—even to\npeople used to the crackling and hissing of telephones—how far speech could be\nreduced and still remain intelligible. Shannon listened closely, not just\nbecause he knew about the relevant telephone engineering but because he had\ndealt with the issues in his secret war work on audio scrambling. Wiener\nperked up, too, in part because of a special interest in prosthetic hearing\naids.\n\nWhen Licklider described some distortion as neither linear nor logarithmic but\n“halfway between,” Wiener interrupted.\n\n“What does ‘halfway’ mean? _X_ plus _S_ over _N_?”\n\nLicklider sighed. “Mathematicians are always doing that, taking me up on\ninexact statements.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1275024) But he had no\nproblem with the math and later offered an estimate for how much\ninformation—using Shannon’s new terminology—could be sent down a transmission\nline, given a certain bandwidth (5,000 cycles) and a certain signal-to-noise\nratio (33 decibels), numbers that were realistic for commercial radio. “I\nthink it appears that 100,000 bits of information can be transmitted through\nsuch a communication channel”—bits per second, he meant. That was a staggering\nnumber; by comparison, he calculated the rate of ordinary human speech this\nway: 10 phonemes per second, chosen from a vocabulary of 64 phonemes (26, “to\nmake it easy”—the logarithm of the number of choices is 6), so a rate of 60\nbits per second. “This assumes that the phonemes are all equally probable—”\n\n“Yes!” interrupted Wiener.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1275283)\n\n“—and of course they are not.”\n\nWiener wondered whether anyone had tried a similar calculation for\n“compression for the eye,” for television. How much “real information” is\nnecessary for intelligibility? Though he added, by the way: “I often wonder\nwhy people try to look at television.”\n\nMargaret Mead had a different issue to raise. She did not want the group to\nforget that meaning can exist quite apart from phonemes and dictionary\ndefinitions. “If you talk about another kind of information,” she said, “if\nyou are trying to communicate the fact that somebody is angry, what order of\ndistortion might be introduced to take the anger out of a message that\notherwise will carry exactly the same\nwords?”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1275462)\n\nThat evening Shannon took the floor. Never mind meaning, he said. He announced\nthat, even though his topic was the redundancy of written English, he was not\ngoing to be interested in _meaning_ at all.\n\nHe was talking about information as something transmitted from one point to\nanother: “It might, for example, be a random sequence of digits, or it might\nbe information for a guided missile or a television\nsignal.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1275664) What mattered was that he was\ngoing to represent the information source as a statistical process, generating\nmessages with varying probabilities. He showed them the sample text strings he\nhad used in _The Mathematical Theory of Communication_ —which few of them had\nread—and described his “prediction experiment,” in which the subject guesses\ntext letter by letter. He told them that English has a specific _entropy_ , a\nquantity correlated with redundancy, and that he could use these experiments\nto compute the number. His listeners were fascinated—Wiener, in particular,\nthinking of his own “prediction theory.”\n\n“My method has some parallelisms to this,” Wiener interrupted. “Excuse me for\ninterrupting.”\n\nThere was a difference in emphasis between Shannon and Wiener. For Wiener,\nentropy was a measure of disorder; for Shannon, of uncertainty. Fundamentally,\nas they were realizing, these were the same. The more inherent order exists in\na sample of English text—order in the form of statistical patterns, known\nconsciously or unconsciously to speakers of the language—the more\npredictability there is, and in Shannon’s terms, the less information is\nconveyed by each subsequent letter. When the subject guesses the next letter\nwith confidence, it is redundant, and the arrival of the letter contributes no\nnew information. Information is surprise.\n\nThe others brimmed with questions about different languages, different prose\nstyles, ideographic writing, and phonemes. One psychologist asked whether\nnewspaper writing would look different, statistically, from the work of James\nJoyce. Leonard Savage, a statistician who worked with von Neumann, asked how\nShannon chose a book for his test: at random?\n\n“I just walked over to the shelf and chose one.”\n\n“I wouldn’t call that random, would you?” said Savage. “There is a danger that\nthe book might be about engineering.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1275864)\nShannon did not tell them that in point of fact it had been a detective novel.\n\nSomeone else wanted to know if Shannon could say whether baby talk would be\nmore or less predictable than the speech of an adult.\n\n“I think more predictable,” he replied, “if you are familiar with the baby.”\n\nEnglish is actually many different languages—as many, perhaps, as there are\nEnglish speakers—each with different statistics. It also spawns artificial\ndialects: the language of symbolic logic, with its restricted and precise\nalphabet, and the language one questioner called “Airplanese,” employed by\ncontrol towers and pilots. And language is in constant flux. Heinz von\nFoerster, a young physicist from Vienna and an early acolyte of Wittgenstein,\nwondered how the degree of redundancy in a language might change as the\nlanguage evolved, and especially in the transition from oral to written\nculture.\n\nVon Foerster, like Margaret Mead and others, felt uncomfortable with the\nnotion of information without meaning. “I wanted to call the whole of what\nthey called information theory _signal_ theory,” he said later, “because\ninformation was not yet there. There were ‘ _beep beeps_ ’ but that was all,\nno information. The moment one transforms that set of signals into other\nsignals our brain can make an understanding of, _then_ information is\nborn—it’s not in the beeps.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1276068) But he\nfound himself thinking of the essence of language, its history in the mind and\nin the culture, in a new way. At first, he pointed out, no one is conscious of\nletters, or phonemes, as basic units of a language.\n\n> > I’m thinking of the old Maya texts, the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians or\n> the Sumerian tables of the first period. During the development of writing\n> it takes some considerable time—or an accident—to recognize that a language\n> can be split into smaller units than words, e.g., syllables or letters. I\n> have the feeling that there is a feedback between writing and\n> speaking.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1276327)\n\nThe discussion changed his mind about the centrality of information. He added\nan epigrammatic note to his transcript of the eighth conference: “Information\ncan be considered as order wrenched from\ndisorder.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1276592)\n\nHard as Shannon tried to keep his listeners focused on his pure, meaning-free\ndefinition of information, this was a group that would not steer clear of\nsemantic entanglements. They quickly grasped Shannon’s essential ideas, and\nthey speculated far afield. “If we could agree to define as information\nanything which changes probabilities or reduces uncertainties,” remarked Alex\nBavelas, a social psychologist, “changes in emotional security could be seen\nquite easily in this light.” What about gestures or facial expressions, pats\non the back or winks across the table? As the psychologists absorbed this\nartificial way of thinking about signals and the brain, their whole discipline\nstood on the brink of a radical transformation.\n\nRalph Gerard, the neuroscientist, was reminded of a story. A stranger is at a\nparty of people who know one another well. One says, “72,” and everyone\nlaughs. Another says, “29,” and the party roars. The stranger asks what is\ngoing on.\n\n> > His neighbor said, “We have many jokes and we have told them so often that\n> now we just use a number.” The guest thought he’d try it, and after a few\n> words said, “63.” The response was feeble. “What’s the matter, isn’t this a\n> joke?”\n>\n\n>> “Oh, yes, that is one of our very best jokes, but you did not tell it\nwell.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1277013)\n\nThe next year Shannon returned with a robot. It was not a very clever robot,\nnor lifelike in appearance, but it impressed the cybernetics group. It solved\nmazes. They called it Shannon’s rat.\n\nHe wheeled out a cabinet with a five-by-five grid on its top panel. Partitions\ncould be placed around and between any of the twenty-five squares to make\nmazes in different configurations. A pin could be placed in any square to\nserve as the goal, and moving around the maze was a sensing rod driven by a\npair of little motors, one for east-west and one for north-south. Under the\nhood lay an array of electrical relays, about seventy-five of them,\ninterconnected, switching on and off to form the robot’s “memory.” Shannon\nflipped the switch to power it up.\n\n“When the machine was turned off,” he said, “the relays essentially forgot\neverything they knew, so that they are now starting afresh, with no knowledge\nof the maze.” His listeners were rapt. “You see the finger now exploring the\nmaze, hunting for the goal. When it reaches the center of a square, the\nmachine makes a new decision as to the next direction to\ntry.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1277238) When the rod hit a partition, the\nmotors reversed and the relays recorded the event. The machine made each\n“decision” based on its previous “knowledge”—it was impossible to avoid these\npsychological words—according to a strategy Shannon had designed. It wandered\nabout the space by trial and error, turning down blind alleys and bumping into\nwalls. Finally, as they all watched, the rat found the goal, a bell rang, a\nlightbulb flashed on, and the motors stopped.\n\nThen Shannon put the rat back at the starting point for a new run. This time\nit went directly to the goal without making any wrong turns or hitting any\npartitions. It had “learned.” Placed in other, unexplored parts of the maze,\nit would revert to trial and error until, eventually, “it builds up a complete\npattern of information and is able to reach the goal directly from any\npoint.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1277492)\n\nTo carry out the exploring and goal-seeking strategy, the machine had to store\none piece of information for each square it visited: namely, the direction by\nwhich it last left the square. There were only four possibilities—north, west,\nsouth, east—so, as Shannon carefully explained, two relays were assigned as\nmemory for each square. Two relays meant two bits of information, enough for a\nchoice among four alternatives, because there were four possible states: off-\noff, off-on, on-off, and on-on.\n\nNext Shannon rearranged the partitions so that the old solution would no\nlonger work. The machine would then “fumble around” till it found a new\nsolution. Sometimes, however, a particularly awkward combination of previous\nmemory and a new maze would put the machine in an endless loop. He showed\nthem: “When it arrives at A, it remembers that the old solution said to go to\nB, and so it goes around the circle, A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D. It has\nestablished a vicious circle, or a singing\ncondition.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1277774)\n\n“A neurosis!” said Ralph Gerard.\n\nShannon added “an antineurotic circuit”: a counter, set to break out of the\nloop when the machine repeated the same sequence six times. Leonard Savage saw\nthat this was a bit of a cheat. “It doesn’t have any way to recognize that it\nis ‘psycho’—it just recognizes that it has been going too long?” he asked.\nShannon agreed.\n\n![](images/00048.jpg)\n\nSHANNON AND HIS MAZE [(Illustration credit\n8.2)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1935727)\n\n“It is all too human,” remarked Lawrence K. Frank.\n\n“George Orwell should have seen this,” said Henry Brosin, a psychiatrist.\n\nA peculiarity of the way Shannon had organized the machine’s\nmemory—associating a single direction with each square—was that the path could\nnot be reversed. Having reached the goal, the machine did not “know” how to\nreturn to its origin. The knowledge, such as it was, emerged from what Shannon\ncalled the vector field, the totality of the twenty-five directional vectors.\n“You can’t say where the sensing finger came from by studying the memory,” he\nexplained.\n\n“Like a man who knows the town,” said McCulloch, “so he can go from any place\nto any other place, but doesn’t always remember how he\nwent.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1278030)\n\nShannon’s rat was kin to Babbage’s silver dancer and the metal swans and\nfishes of Merlin’s Mechanical Museum: automata performing a simulation of\nlife. They never failed to amaze and entertain. The dawn of the information\nage brought a whole new generation of synthetic mice, beetles, and turtles,\nmade with vacuum tubes and then transistors. They were crude, almost trivial,\nby the standards of just a few years later. In the case of the rat, the\ncreature’s total memory amounted to seventy-five bits. Yet Shannon could\nfairly claim that it solved a problem by trial and error; retained the\nsolution and repeated it without the errors; integrated new information from\nfurther experience; and “forgot” the solution when circumstances changed. The\nmachine was not only imitating lifelike behavior; it was performing functions\npreviously reserved for brains.\n\nOne critic, Dennis Gabor, a Hungarian electrical engineer who later won the\nNobel Prize for inventing holography, complained, “In reality it is the maze\nwhich remembers, not the mouse.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1278216) This\nwas true up to a point. After all, there was no mouse. The electrical relays\ncould have been placed anywhere, and they held the memory. They became, in\neffect, a mental model of a maze—a _theory_ of a maze.\n\nThe postwar United States was hardly the only place where biologists and\nneuroscientists were suddenly making common cause with mathematicians and\nelectrical engineers—though Americans sometimes talked as though it was.\nWiener, who recounted his travels to other countries at some length in his\nintroduction to _Cybernetics_ , wrote dismissively that in England he had\nfound researchers to be “well-informed” but that not much progress had been\nmade “in unifying the subject and in pulling the various threads of research\ntogether.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1278579) New cadres of British\nscientists began coalescing in response to information theory and cybernetics\nin 1949—mostly young, with fresh experience in code breaking, radar, and gun\ncontrol. One of their ideas was to form a dining club in the English\nfashion—“limited membership and a post-prandial situation,” proposed John\nBates, a pioneer in electroencephalography. This required considerable\ndiscussion of names, membership rules, venues, and emblems. Bates wanted\nelectrically inclined biologists and biologically oriented engineers and\nsuggested “about fifteen people who had Wiener’s ideas before Wiener’s book\nappeared.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1278803) They met for the first time\nin the basement of the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, in Bloomsbury,\nand decided to call themselves the Ratio Club—a name meaning whatever anyone\nwanted. (Their chroniclers Philip Husbands and Owen Holland, who interviewed\nmany of the surviving members, report that half pronounced it RAY-she-oh and\nhalf RAT-ee-oh.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1279139)) For their first\nmeeting they invited Warren McCulloch.\n\nThey talked not just about understanding brains but “designing” them. A\npsychiatrist, W. Ross Ashby, announced that he was working on the idea that “a\nbrain consisting of randomly connected impressional synapses would assume the\nrequired degree of orderliness as a result of\nexperience”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1279478)—in other words, that the\nmind is a self-organizing dynamical system. Others wanted to talk about\npattern recognition, about noise in the nervous system, about robot chess and\nthe possibility of mechanical self-awareness. McCulloch put it this way:\n“Think of the brain as a telegraphic relay, which, tripped by a signal, emits\nanother signal.” Relays had come a long way since Morse’s time. “Of the\nmolecular events of brains these signals are the atoms. Each goes or does not\ngo.” The fundamental unit is a choice, and it is binary. “It is the least\nevent that can be true or false.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1279697)\n\nThey also managed to attract Alan Turing, who published his own manifesto with\na provocative opening statement—“I propose to consider the question, ‘Can\nmachines think?’ ”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1280076)—followed by a sly\nadmission that he would do so without even trying to define the terms\n_machine_ and _think_. His idea was to replace the question with a test called\nthe Imitation Game, destined to become famous as the “Turing Test.” In its\ninitial form the Imitation Game involves three people: a man, a woman, and an\ninterrogator. The interrogator sits in a room apart and poses questions\n(ideally, Turing suggests, by way of a “teleprinter communicating between the\ntwo rooms”). The interrogator aims to determine which is the man and which is\nthe woman. One of the two—say, the man—aims to trick the interrogator, while\nthe other aims to help reveal the truth. “The best strategy for her is\nprobably to give truthful answers,” Turing suggests. “She can add such things\nas ‘I am the woman, don’t listen to him!’ but it will avail nothing as the man\ncan make similar remarks.”\n\nBut what if the question is not which gender but which genus: human or\nmachine?\n\nIt is understood that the essence of being human lies in one’s “intellectual\ncapacities”; hence this game of disembodied messages transmitted blindly\nbetween rooms. “We do not wish to penalise the machine for its inability to\nshine in beauty competitions,” says Turing dryly, “nor to penalise a man for\nlosing in a race against an aeroplane.” Nor, for that matter, for slowness in\narithmetic. Turing offers up some imagined questions and answers:\n\n> > Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.\n>\n\n>> A: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.\n\nBefore proceeding further, however, he finds it necessary to explain just what\nsort of machine he has in mind. “The present interest in ‘thinking machines,’\n” he notes, “has been aroused by a particular kind of machine, usually called\nan ‘electronic computer’ or ‘digital computer.’\n”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1280388) These devices do the work of human\ncomputers, faster and more reliably. Turing spells out, as Shannon had not,\nthe nature and properties of the digital computer. John von Neumann had done\nthis, too, in constructing a successor machine to ENIAC. The digital computer\ncomprises three parts: a “store of information,” corresponding to the human\ncomputer’s memory or paper; an “executive unit,” which carries out individual\noperations; and a “control,” which manages a list of instructions, making sure\nthey are carried out in the right order. These instructions are encoded as\nnumbers. They are sometimes called a “programme,” Turing explains, and\nconstructing such a list may be called “programming.”\n\nThe idea is an old one, Turing says, and he cites Charles Babbage, whom he\nidentifies as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge from 1828 to\n1839—once so famous, now almost forgotten. Turing explains that Babbage “had\nall the essential ideas” and “planned such a machine, called the Analytical\nEngine, but it was never completed.” It would have used wheels and\ncards—nothing to do with electricity. The existence (or nonexistence, but at\nleast near existence) of Babbage’s engine allows Turing to rebut a\nsuperstition he senses forming in the zeitgeist of 1950. People seem to feel\nthat the magic of digital computers is essentially electrical; meanwhile, the\nnervous system is also electrical. But Turing is at pains to think of\ncomputation in a universal way, which means in an abstract way. He knows it is\nnot about electricity at all:\n\n> > Since Babbage’s machine was not electrical, and since all digital\n> computers are in a sense equivalent, we see that this use of electricity\n> cannot be of theoretical importance.… The feature of using electricity is\n> thus seen to be only a very superficial\n> similarity.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1280610)\n\nTuring’s famous computer was a machine made of logic: imaginary tape,\narbitrary symbols. It had all the time in the world and unbounded memory, and\nit could do anything expressible in steps and operations. It could even judge\nthe validity of a proof in the system of _Principia Mathematica_. “In the case\nthat the formula is neither provable nor disprovable such a machine certainly\ndoes not behave in a very satisfactory manner, for it continues to work\nindefinitely without producing any result at all, but this cannot be regarded\nas very different from the reaction of the\nmathematicians.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1280816) So Turing supposed it\ncould play the Imitation Game.\n\nHe could not pretend to prove that, of course. He was mainly trying to change\nthe terms of a debate he considered largely fatuous. He offered a few\npredictions for the half century to come: that computers would have a storage\ncapacity of 109 bits (he imagined a few very large computers; he did not\nforesee our future of ubiquitous tiny computing devices with storage many\nmagnitudes greater than that); and that they might be programmed to play the\nImitation Game well enough to fool some interrogators for at least a few\nminutes (true, as far as it goes).\n\n> > The original question, “Can machines think?” I believe to be too\n> meaningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at the end of\n> the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered\n> so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without\n> expecting to be contradicted.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1281273)\n\nHe did not live to see how apt his prophecy was. In 1952 he was arrested for\nthe crime of homosexuality, tried, convicted, stripped of his security\nclearance, and subjected by the British authorities to a humiliating,\nemasculating program of estrogen injections. In 1954 he took his own life.\n\nUntil years later, few knew of Turing’s crucial secret work for his country on\nthe Enigma project at Bletchley Park. His ideas of thinking machines did\nattract attention, on both sides of the Atlantic. Some of the people who found\nthe notion absurd or even frightening appealed to Shannon for his opinion; he\nstood squarely with Turing. “The idea of a machine thinking is by no means\nrepugnant to all of us,” Shannon told one engineer. “In fact, I find the\nconverse idea, that the human brain may itself be a machine which could be\nduplicated functionally with inanimate objects, quite attractive.” More\nuseful, anyway, than “hypothecating intangible and unreachable ‘vital forces,’\n‘souls’ and the like.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1281535)\n\nComputer scientists wanted to know what their machines could do. Psychologists\nwanted to know whether brains are computers—or perhaps whether brains are\n_merely_ computers. At midcentury computer scientists were new; but so, in\ntheir way, were psychologists.\n\nPsychology at midcentury had grown moribund. Of all the sciences, it always\nhad the most difficulty in saying what exactly it studied. Originally its\nobject was the soul, as opposed to the body (somatology) and the blood\n(hematology). “ _Psychologie_ is a doctrine which searches out man’s Soul, and\nthe effects of it; this is the part without which a man cannot\nconsist,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1281824) wrote James de Back in the\nseventeenth century. Almost by definition, though, the soul was\nineffable—hardly a thing to be known. Complicating matters further was the\nentanglement (in psychology as in no other field) of the observer with the\nobserved. In 1854, when it was still more likely to be called “mental\nphilosophy,” David Brewster lamented that no other department of knowledge had\nmade so little progress as “the science of mind, if it can be called a\nscience.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1282440)\n\n> > Viewed as material by one inquirer, as spiritual by another, and by others\n> as mysteriously compounded as both, the human mind escapes from the\n> cognisance of sense and reason, and lies, a waste field with a northern\n> exposure, upon which every passing speculator casts his mental tares.\n\nThe passing speculators were still looking mainly inward, and the limits of\nintrospection were apparent. Looking for rigor, verifiability, and perhaps\neven mathematicization, students of the mind veered in radically different\ndirections by the turn of the twentieth century. Sigmund Freud’s path was only\none. In the United States, William James constructed a discipline of\npsychology almost single-handed—professor of the first university courses,\nauthor of the first comprehensive textbook—and when he was done, he threw up\nhis hands. His own _Principles of Psychology_ , he wrote, was “a loathsome,\ndistended, tumefied, bloated, dropsical mass, testifying to but two facts:\n_1st_ , that there is no such thing as a _science_ of psychology, and _2nd_ ,\nthat WJ is an incapable.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1282690)\n\nIn Russia, a new strain of psychology began with a physiologist, Ivan\nPetrovich Pavlov, known for his Nobel Prize–winning study of digestion, who\nscorned the word _psychology_ and all its associated terminology. James, in\nhis better moods, considered psychology the science of mental life, but for\nPavlov there was no mind, only behavior. Mental states, thoughts, emotions,\ngoals, and purpose—all these were intangible, subjective, and out of reach.\nThey bore the taint of religion and superstition. What James had identified as\ncentral topics—“the stream of thought,” “the consciousness of self,” the\nperception of time and space, imagination, reasoning, and will—had no place in\nPavlov’s laboratory. All a scientist could observe was behavior, and this, at\nleast, could be recorded and measured. The behaviorists, particularly John B.\nWatson in the United States and then, most famously, B. F. Skinner, made a\nscience based on stimulus and response: food pellets, bells, electric shocks;\nsalivation, lever pressing, maze running. Watson said that the whole purpose\nof psychology was to predict what responses would follow a given stimulus and\nwhat stimuli could produce a given behavior. Between stimulus and response lay\na black box, known to be composed of sense organs, neural pathways, and motor\nfunctions, but fundamentally off limits. In effect, the behaviorists were\nsaying yet again that the soul is ineffable. For a half century, their\nresearch program thrived because it produced results about conditioning\nreflexes and controlling behavior.\n\nBehaviorists said, as the psychologist George Miller put it afterward: “You\ntalk about memory; you talk about anticipation; you talk about your feelings;\nyou talk about all these mentalistic things. That’s moonshine. Show me one,\npoint to one.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1283069) They could teach pigeons\nto play ping-pong and rats to run mazes. But by midcentury, frustration had\nset in. The behaviorists’ purity had become a dogma; their refusal to consider\nmental states became a cage, and psychologists still wanted to understand what\nthe mind was.\n\nInformation theory gave them a way in. Scientists analyzed the processing of\ninformation and built machines to do it. The machines had memory. They\nsimulated learning and goal seeking. A behaviorist running a rat through a\nmaze would discuss the association between stimulus and response but would\nrefuse to speculate in any way about the _mind_ of the rat; now engineers were\nbuilding mental models of rats out of a few electrical relays. They were not\njust prying open the black box; they were making their own. Signals were being\ntransmitted, encoded, stored, and retrieved. Internal models of the external\nworld were created and updated. Psychologists took note. From information\ntheory and cybernetics, they received a set of useful metaphors and even a\nproductive conceptual framework. Shannon’s rat could be seen not only as a\nvery crude model of the brain but also as a theory of behavior. Suddenly\npsychologists were free to talk about plans, algorithms, syntactic rules. They\ncould investigate not just how living creatures react to the outside world but\nhow they represent it to themselves.\n\nShannon’s formulation of information theory seemed to invite researchers to\nlook in a direction that he himself had not intended. He had declared, “The\nfundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point\neither exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.” A\npsychologist could hardly fail to consider the case where the source of the\nmessage is the outside world and the receiver is the mind.\n\nEars and eyes were to be understood as message channels, so why not test and\nmeasure them like microphones and cameras? “New concepts of the nature and\nmeasure of information,” wrote Homer Jacobson, a chemist at Hunter College in\nNew York, “have made it possible to specify quantitatively the informational\ncapacity of the human ear,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1283357) and he\nproceeded to do so. Then he did the same for the eye, arriving at an estimate\nfour hundred times greater, in bits per second. Many more subtle kinds of\nexperiments were suddenly fair game, some of them directly suggested by\nShannon’s work on noise and redundancy. A group in 1951 tested the likelihood\nthat listeners would hear a word correctly when they knew it was one of just a\nfew alternatives, as opposed to many\nalternatives.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1283784) It seemed obvious but had\nnever been done. Experimenters explored the effect of trying to understand two\nconversations at once. They began considering how much information an ensemble\nof items contained—digits or letters or words—and how much could be understood\nor remembered. In standard experiments, with speech and buzzers and key\npressing and foot tapping, the language of stimulus and response began to give\nway to transmission and reception of information.\n\nFor a brief period, researchers discussed the transition explicitly; later it\nbecame invisible. Donald Broadbent, an English experimental psychologist\nexploring issues of attention and short-term memory, wrote of one experiment\nin 1958: “The difference between a description of the results in terms of\nstimulus and response, and a description in information theory terms, becomes\nmost marked.… One could no doubt develop an adequate description of the\nresults in S-R terms … but such a description is clumsy compared to the\ninformation theory description.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1284161)\nBroadbent founded an applied psychology division at Cambridge University, and\na flood of research followed, there and elsewhere, in the general realm of how\npeople handle information: effects of noise on performance; selective\nattention and filtering of perception; short-term and long-term memory;\npattern recognition; problem solving. And where did logic belong? To\npsychology or to computer science? Surely not just to philosophy.\n\nAn influential counterpart of Broadbent’s in the United States was George\nMiller, who helped found the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard in 1960.\nHe was already famous for a paper published in 1956 under the slightly\nwhimsical title “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on\nOur Capacity for Processing\nInformation.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1284437) Seven seemed to be the\nnumber of items that most people could hold in working memory at any one time:\nseven digits (the typical American telephone number of the time), seven words,\nor seven objects displayed by an experimental psychologist. The number also\nkept popping up, Miller claimed, in other sorts of experiments. Laboratory\nsubjects were fed sips of water with different amounts of salt, to see how\nmany different levels of saltiness they could discriminate. They were asked to\ndetect differences between tones of varying pitch or loudness. They were shown\nrandom patterns of dots, flashed on a screen, and asked how many (below seven,\nthey almost always knew; above seven, they almost always estimated). In one\nway and another, the number seven kept recurring as a threshold. “This number\nassumes a variety of disguises,” he wrote, “being sometimes a little larger\nand sometimes a little smaller than usual, but never changing so much as to be\nunrecognizable.”\n\nClearly this was a crude simplification of some kind; as Miller noted, people\ncan identify any of thousands of faces or words and can memorize long\nsequences of symbols. To see what kind of simplification, he turned to\ninformation theory, and especially to Shannon’s understanding of information\nas a selection among possible alternatives. “The observer is considered to be\na communication channel,” he announced—a formulation sure to appall the\nbehaviorists who dominated the profession. Information is being transmitted\nand stored—information about loudness, or saltiness, or number. He explained\nabout bits:\n\n> > One bit of information is the amount of information that we need to make a\n> decision between two equally likely alternatives. If we must decide whether\n> a man is less than six feet tall or more than six feet tall and if we know\n> that the chances are 50-50, then we need one bit of information.…\n>\n\n>> Two bits of information enable us to decide among four equally likely\nalternatives. Three bits of information enable us to decide among eight\nequally likely alternatives … and so on. That is to say, if there are 32\nequally likely alternatives, we must make five successive binary decisions,\nworth one bit each, before we know which alternative is correct. So the\ngeneral rule is simple: every time the number of alternatives is increased by\na factor of two, one bit of information is added.\n\nThe magical number seven is really just under three bits. Simple experiments\nmeasured discrimination, or channel capacity, in a single dimension; more\ncomplex measures arise from combinations of variables in multiple\ndimensions—for example, size, brightness, and hue. And people perform acts of\nwhat information theorists call “recoding,” grouping information into larger\nand larger chunks—for example, organizing telegraph dots and dashes into\nletters, letters into words, and words into phrases. By now Miller’s argument\nhad become something in the nature of a manifesto. Recoding, he declared,\n“seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes.”\n\n> > The concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a\n> quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides\n> us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring\n> the performance of our subjects.… Informational concepts have already proved\n> valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a\n> great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been\n> proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of\n> questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth\n> another look.\n\nThis was the beginning of the movement called the cognitive revolution in\npsychology, and it laid the foundation for the discipline called cognitive\nscience, combining psychology, computer science, and philosophy. Looking back,\nsome philosophers have called this moment the informational turn. “Those who\ntake the informational turn see information as the basic ingredient in\nbuilding a mind,” writes Frederick Adams. “Information has to contribute to\nthe origin of the mental.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1284661) As Miller\nhimself liked to say, the mind came in on the back of the\nmachine.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1284958)\n\nShannon was hardly a household name—he never did become famous to the general\npublic—but he had gained an iconic stature in his own academic communities,\nand sometimes he gave popular talks about “information” at universities and\nmuseums. He would explain the basic ideas; puckishly quote Matthew 5:37, “Let\nyour communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these\ncometh of evil” as a template for the notions of bits and of redundant\nencoding; and speculate about the future of computers and automata. “Well, to\nconclude,” he said at the University of Pennsylvania, “I think that this\npresent century in a sense will see a great upsurge and development of this\nwhole information business; the business of collecting information and the\nbusiness of transmitting it from one point to another, and perhaps most\nimportant of all, the business of processing\nit.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1285161)\n\nWith psychologists, anthropologists, linguists, economists, and all sorts of\nsocial scientists climbing aboard the bandwagon of information theory, some\nmathematicians and engineers were uncomfortable. Shannon himself called it a\nbandwagon. In 1956 he wrote a short warning notice—four paragraphs: “Our\nfellow scientists in many different fields, attracted by the fanfare and by\nthe new avenues opened to scientific analysis, are using these ideas in their\nown problems.… Although this wave of popularity is certainly pleasant and\nexciting for those of us working in the field, it carries at the same time an\nelement of danger.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1285597) Information theory\nwas in its hard core a branch of mathematics, he reminded them. He,\npersonally, did believe that its concepts would prove useful in other fields,\nbut not everywhere, and not easily: “The establishing of such applications is\nnot a trivial matter of translating words to a new domain, but rather the slow\ntedious process of hypothesis and experimental verification.” Furthermore, he\nfelt the hard slogging had barely begun in “our own house.” He urged more\nresearch and less exposition.\n\nAs for cybernetics, the word began to fade. The Macy cyberneticians held their\nlast meeting in 1953, at the Nassau Inn in Princeton; Wiener had fallen out\nwith several of the group, who were barely speaking to him. Given the task of\nsumming up, McCulloch sounded wistful. “Our consensus has never been\nunanimous,” he said. “Even had it been so, I see no reason why God should have\nagreed with us.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1285870)\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Shannon remained the intellectual leader of the field he\nhad founded. His research produced dense, theorem-packed papers, pregnant with\npossibilities for development, laying foundations for broad fields of study.\nWhat Marshall McLuhan later called the “medium” was for Shannon the channel,\nand the channel was subject to rigorous mathematical treatment. The\napplications were immediate and the results fertile: broadcast channels and\nwiretap channels, noisy and noiseless channels, Gaussian channels, channels\nwith input constraints and cost constraints, channels with feedback and\nchannels with memory, multiuser channels and multiaccess channels. (When\nMcLuhan announced that the medium was the message, he was being arch. The\nmedium is both opposite to, and entwined with, the message.)\n\n![](images/00049.jpg)\n\nCLAUDE SHANNON (1963) [(Illustration credit\n8.3)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1935876)\n\nOne of Shannon’s essential results, the noisy coding theorem, grew in\nimportance, showing that error correction can effectively counter noise and\ncorruption. At first this was just a tantalizing theoretical nicety; error\ncorrection requires computation, which was not yet cheap. But during the\n1950s, work on error-correcting methods began to fulfill Shannon’s promise,\nand the need for them became apparent. One application was exploration of\nspace with rockets and satellites; they needed to send messages very long\ndistances with limited power. Coding theory became a crucial part of computer\nscience, with error correction and data compression advancing side by side.\nWithout it, modems, CDs, and digital television would not exist. For\nmathematicians interested in random processes, coding theorems are also\nmeasures of entropy.\n\nShannon, meanwhile, made other theoretical advances that planted seeds for\nfuture computer design. One discovery showed how to maximize flow through a\nnetwork of many branches, where the network could be a communication channel\nor a railroad or a power grid or water pipes. Another was aptly titled\n“Reliable Circuits Using Crummy Relays” (though this was changed for\npublication to “… Less Reliable\nRelays”).[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1286116) He studied switching\nfunctions, rate-distortion theory, and differential entropy. All this was\ninvisible to the public, but the seismic tremors that came with the dawn of\ncomputing were felt widely, and Shannon was part of that, too.\n\nAs early as 1948 he completed the first paper on a problem that he said, “of\ncourse, is of no importance in itself”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1286374):\nhow to program a machine to play chess. People had tried this before,\nbeginning in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when various chess\nautomata toured Europe and were revealed every so often to have small humans\nhiding inside. In 1910 the Spanish mathematician and tinkerer Leonardo Torres\ny Quevedo built a real chess machine, entirely mechanical, called El\nAjedrecista, that could play a simple three-piece endgame, king and rook\nagainst king.\n\nShannon now showed that computers performing numerical calculations could be\nmade to play a full chess game. As he explained, these devices, “containing\nseveral thousand vacuum tubes, relays, and other elements,” retained numbers\nin “memory,” and a clever process of translation could make these numbers\nrepresent the squares and pieces of a chessboard. The principles he laid out\nhave been employed in every chess program since. In these salad days of\ncomputing, many people immediately assumed that chess would be _solved:_ fully\nknown, in all its pathways and combinations. They thought a fast electronic\ncomputer would play perfect chess, just as they thought it would make reliable\nlong-term weather forecasts. Shannon made a rough calculation, however, and\nsuggested that the number of possible chess games was more than 10120—a number\nthat dwarfs the age of the universe in nanoseconds. So computers cannot play\nchess by brute force; they must reason, as Shannon saw, along something like\nhuman lines.\n\nHe visited the American champion Edward Lasker in his apartment on East\nTwenty-third Street in New York, and Lasker offered suggestions for\nimprovement.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1286877) When _Scientific American_\npublished a simplified version of his paper in 1950, Shannon could not resist\nraising the question on everyone’s minds: “Does a chess-playing machine of\nthis type ‘think’ ”\n\n> > From a behavioristic point of view, the machine acts as though it were\n> thinking. It has always been considered that skillful chess play requires\n> the reasoning faculty. If we regard thinking as a property of external\n> actions rather than internal method the machine is surely thinking.\n\nNonetheless, as of 1952 he estimated that it would take three programmers\nworking six months to enable a large-scale computer to play even a tolerable\namateur game. “The problem of a learning chess player is even farther in the\nfuture than a preprogrammed type. The methods which have been suggested are\nobviously extravagantly slow. The machine would wear out before winning a\nsingle game.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1287127) The point, though, was to\nlook in as many directions as possible for what a general-purpose computer\ncould do.\n\nHe was exercising his sense of whimsy, too. He designed and actually built a\nmachine to do arithmetic with Roman numerals: for example, IV times XII equals\nXLVIII. He dubbed this THROBAC I, an acronym for Thrifty Roman-numeral\nBackward-looking Computer. He created a “mind-reading machine” meant to play\nthe child’s guessing game of odds and evens. What all these flights of fancy\nhad in common was an extension of algorithmic processes into new realms—the\nabstract mapping of ideas onto mathematical objects. Later, he wrote thousands\nof words on scientific aspects of\njuggling[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1287415)—with theorems and\ncorollaries—and included from memory a quotation from E. E. Cummings: “Some\nson-of-a-bitch will invent a machine to measure Spring with.”\n\nIn the 1950s Shannon was also trying to design a machine that would repair\nitself.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1287840) If a relay failed, the machine\nwould locate and replace it. He speculated on the possibility of a machine\nthat could reproduce itself, collecting parts from the environment and\nassembling them. Bell Labs was happy for him to travel and give talks on such\nthings, often demonstrating his maze-learning machine, but audiences were not\nuniversally delighted. The word “Frankenstein” was heard. “I wonder if you\nboys realize what you’re toying around with there,” wrote a newspaper\ncolumnist in Wyoming.\n\n> > What happens if you switch on one of these mechanical computers but forget\n> to turn it off before you leave for lunch? Well, I’ll tell you. The same\n> thing would happen in the way of computers in America that happened to\n> Australia with jack rabbits. Before you could multiply 701,945,240 by\n> 879,030,546, every family in the country would have a little computer of\n> their own.…\n>\n\n>> Mr. Shannon, I don’t mean to knock your experiments, but frankly I’m not\nremotely interested in even one computer, and I’m going to be pretty sore if a\ngang of them crowd in on me to multiply or divide or whatever they do\nbest.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1288091)\n\nTwo years after Shannon raised his warning flag about the bandwagon, a younger\ninformation theorist, Peter Elias, published a notice complaining about a\npaper titled “Information Theory, Photosynthesis, and\nReligion.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1288393) There was, of course, no\nsuch paper. But there had been papers on information theory, life, and\ntopology; information theory and the physics of tissue damage; and clerical\nsystems; and psychopharmacology; and geophysical data interpretation; and\ncrystal structure; and melody. Elias, whose father had worked for Edison as an\nengineer, was himself a serious specialist—a major contributor to coding\ntheory. He mistrusted the softer, easier, platitudinous work flooding across\ndisciplinary boundaries. The typical paper, he said, “discusses the\nsurprisingly close relationship between the vocabulary and conceptual\nframework of information theory and that of psychology (or genetics, or\nlinguistics, or psychiatry, or business organization).… The concepts of\nstructure, pattern, entropy, noise, transmitter, receiver, and code are (when\nproperly interpreted) central to both.” He declared this to be larceny.\n“Having placed the discipline of psychology for the first time on a sound\nscientific basis, the author modestly leaves the filling in of the outline to\nthe psychologists.” He suggested his colleagues give up larceny for a life of\nhonest toil.\n\nThese warnings from Shannon and Elias appeared in one of the growing number of\nnew journals entirely devoted to information theory.\n\nIn these circles a notorious buzzword was _entropy_. Another researcher, Colin\nCherry, complained, “We have heard of ‘entropies’ of languages, social\nsystems, and economic systems and of its use in various method-starved\nstudies. It is the kind of sweeping generality which people will clutch like a\nstraw.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1288703) He did not say, because it was\nnot yet apparent, that information theory was beginning to change the course\nof theoretical physics and of the life sciences and that entropy was one of\nthe reasons.\n\nIn the social sciences, the direct influence of information theorists had\npassed its peak. The specialized mathematics had less and less to contribute\nto psychology and more and more to computer science. But their contributions\nhad been real. They had catalyzed the social sciences and prepared them for\nthe new age under way. The work had begun; the informational turn could not be\nundone.\n\n* * *\n\n* As Jean-Pierre Dupuy remarks: “It was, at bottom, a perfectly ordinary situation, in which scientists blamed nonscientists for taking them at their word. Having planted the idea in the public mind that thinking machines were just around the corner, the cyberneticians hastened to dissociate themselves from anyone gullible enough to believe such a thing.”\n\n\n# 9 | ENTROPY AND ITS DEMONS\n\n\n##\n\n> (You Cannot Stir Things Apart)\n\n> _Thought interferes with the probability of events, and, in the long run\n> therefore, with entropy._\n\n> —David L. Watson (1930)[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1289098)\n\nIT WOULD BE AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY that no one knew what _entropy_ meant.\nStill, it was one of those words. The rumor at Bell Labs was that Shannon had\ngotten it from John von Neumann, who advised him he would win every argument\nbecause no one would understand it.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1289383)\nUntrue, but plausible. The word began by meaning the opposite of itself. It\nremains excruciatingly difficult to define. The _Oxford English Dictionary_ ,\nuncharacteristically, punts:\n\n> > 1\\. The name given to one of the quantitative elements which determine the\n> thermodynamic condition of a portion of matter.\n\nRudolf Clausius coined the word in 1865, in the course of creating a science\nof thermodynamics. He needed to name a certain quantity that he had\ndiscovered—a quantity related to energy, but not energy.\n\nThermodynamics arose hand in hand with steam engines; it was at first nothing\nmore than “the theoretical study of the steam\nengine.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1289699) It concerned itself with the\nconversion of heat, or energy, into work. As this occurs—heat drives an\nengine—Clausius observed that the heat does not actually get lost; it merely\npasses from a hotter body into a cooler body. On its way, it accomplishes\nsomething. This is like a waterwheel, as Nicolas Sadi Carnot kept pointing out\nin France: water begins at the top and ends at the bottom, and no water is\ngained or lost, but the water performs work on the way down. Carnot imagined\nheat as just such a substance. The ability of a thermodynamic system to\nproduce work depends not on the heat itself, but on the contrast between hot\nand cold. A hot stone plunged into cold water can generate work—for example,\nby creating steam that drives a turbine—but the total heat in the system\n(stone plus water) remains constant. Eventually, the stone and the water reach\nthe same temperature. No matter how much energy a closed system contains, when\neverything is the same temperature, no work can be done.\n\nIt is the unavailability of this energy—its uselessness for work—that Clausius\nwanted to measure. He came up with the word _entropy_ , formed from Greek to\nmean “transformation content.” His English counterparts immediately saw the\npoint but decided Clausius had it backward in focusing on the negative. James\nClerk Maxwell suggested in his _Theory of Heat_ that it would be “more\nconvenient” to make entropy mean the opposite: “the part which _can_ be\nconverted into mechanical work.” Thus:\n\n> > When the pressure and temperature of the system have become uniform the\n> entropy is exhausted.\n\nWithin a few years, though, Maxwell turned about-face and decided to follow\nClausius.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1289990) He rewrote his book and added\nan abashed footnote:\n\n> > In former editions of this book the meaning of the term Entropy, as\n> introduced by Clausius, was erroneously stated to be that part of the energy\n> which cannot be converted into work. The book then proceeded to use the term\n> as equivalent to the available energy; thus introducing great confusion into\n> the language of thermodynamics. In this edition I have endeavoured to use\n> the word Entropy according to its original definition by Clausius.\n\nThe problem was not just in choosing between positive and negative. It was\nsubtler than that. Maxwell had first considered entropy as a subtype of\nenergy: the energy available for work. On reconsideration, he recognized that\nthermodynamics needed an entirely different measure. Entropy was not a kind of\nenergy or an amount of energy; it was, as Clausius had said, the\n_unavailability_ of energy. Abstract though this was, it turned out to be a\nquantity as measurable as temperature, volume, or pressure.\n\nIt became a totemic concept. With entropy, the “laws” of thermodynamics could\nbe neatly expressed:\n\n> First law: The energy of the universe is constant.\n>\n> Second law: The entropy of the universe always increases.\n\nThere are many other formulations of these laws, from the mathematical to the\nwhimsical, e.g., “1. You can’t win; 2. You can’t break even\neither.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1290287) But this is the cosmic,\nfateful one. The universe is running down. It is a degenerative one-way\nstreet. The final state of maximum entropy is our destiny.\n\nWilliam Thomson, Lord Kelvin, imprinted the second law on the popular\nimagination by reveling in its bleakness: “Although mechanical energy is\n_indestructible_ ,” he declared in 1862, “there is a universal tendency to its\ndissipation, which produces gradual augmentation and diffusion of heat,\ncessation of motion, and exhaustion of potential energy through the material\nuniverse. The result of this would be a state of universal rest and\ndeath.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1290561) Thus entropy dictated the\nuniverse’s fate in H. G. Wells’s novel _The Time Machine:_ the life ebbing\naway, the dying sun, the “abominable desolation that hung over the world.”\nHeat death is not cold; it is lukewarm and dull. Freud thought he saw\nsomething useful there in 1918, though he muddled it: “In considering the\nconversion of psychical energy no less than of physical, we must make use of\nthe concept of an entropy, which opposes the undoing of what has already\noccurred.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1291059)\n\nThomson liked the word _dissipation_ for this. Energy is not lost, but it\ndissipates. Dissipated energy is present but useless. It was Maxwell, though,\nwho began to focus on the confusion itself—the disorder—as entropy’s essential\nquality. Disorder seemed strangely unphysical. It implied that a piece of the\nequation must be something like knowledge, or intelligence, or judgment. “The\nidea of dissipation of energy depends on the extent of our knowledge,” Maxwell\nsaid. “Available energy is energy which we can direct into any desired\nchannel. Dissipated energy is energy which we cannot lay hold of and direct at\npleasure, such as the energy of the confused agitation of molecules which we\ncall heat.” What _we_ can do, or know, became part of the definition. It\nseemed impossible to talk about order and disorder without involving an agent\nor an observer—without talking about the mind:\n\n> > Confusion, like the correlative term order, is not a property of material\n> things in themselves, but only in relation to the mind which perceives them.\n> A memorandum-book does not, provided it is neatly written, appear confused\n> to an illiterate person, or to the owner who understands it thoroughly, but\n> to any other person able to read it appears to be inextricably confused.\n> Similarly the notion of dissipated energy could not occur to a being who\n> could not turn any of the energies of nature to his own account, or to one\n> who could trace the motion of every molecule and seize it at the right\n> moment.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1291464)\n\nOrder is subjective—in the eye of the beholder. Order and confusion are not\nthe sorts of things a mathematician would try to define or measure. Or are\nthey? If disorder corresponded to entropy, maybe it was ready for scientific\ntreatment after all.\n\nAs an ideal case, the pioneers of thermodynamics considered a box of gas.\nBeing made of atoms, it is far from simple or calm. It is a vast ensemble of\nagitating particles. Atoms were unseen and hypothetical, but these\ntheorists—Clausius, Kelvin, Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, Willard Gibbs—accepted\nthe atomic nature of a fluid and tried to work out the consequences: mixing,\nviolence, continuous motion. This motion constitutes heat, they now\nunderstood. Heat is no substance, no fluid, no “phlogiston”—just the motion of\nmolecules.\n\nIndividually the molecules must be obeying Newton’s laws—every action, every\ncollision, measurable and calculable, in theory. But there were too many to\nmeasure and calculate individually. Probability entered the picture. The new\nscience of statistical mechanics made a bridge between the microscopic details\nand the macroscopic behavior. Suppose the box of gas is divided by a\ndiaphragm. The gas on side A is hotter than the gas on side B—that is, the A\nmolecules are moving faster, with greater energy. As soon as the divider is\nremoved, the molecules begin to mix; the fast collide with the slow; energy is\nexchanged; and after some time the gas reaches a uniform temperature. The\nmystery is this: Why can the process not be reversed? In Newton’s equations of\nmotion, time can have a plus sign or a minus sign; the mathematics works\neither way. In the real world past and future cannot be interchanged so\neasily.\n\n“Time flows on, never comes back,” said Léon Brillouin in 1949. “When the\nphysicist is confronted with this fact he is greatly\ndisturbed.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1291929) Maxwell had been mildly\ndisturbed. He wrote to Lord Rayleigh:\n\n> > If this world is a purely dynamical system, and if you accurately reverse\n> the motion of every particle of it at the same instant, then all things will\n> happen backwards to the beginning of things, the raindrops will collect\n> themselves from the ground and fly up to the clouds, etc, etc, and men will\n> see their friends passing from the grave to the cradle till we ourselves\n> become the reverse of born, whatever that is.\n\nHis point was that in the microscopic details, if we watch the motions of\nindividual molecules, their behavior is the same forward and backward in time.\nWe can run the film backward. But pan out, watch the box of gas as an\nensemble, and statistically the mixing process becomes a one-way street. We\ncan watch the fluid for all eternity, and it will never divide itself into hot\nmolecules on one side and cool on the other. The clever young Thomasina says\nin Tom Stoppard’s _Arcadia_ , “You cannot stir things apart,” and this is\nprecisely the same as “Time flows on, never comes back.” Such processes run in\none direction only. Probability is the reason. What is remarkable—physicists\ntook a long time to accept it—is that every irreversible process must be\nexplained the same way. Time itself depends on chance, or “the accidents of\nlife,” as Richard Feynman liked to say: “Well, you see that all there is to it\nis that the irreversibility is caused by the general accidents of\nlife.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1292368) For the box of gas to come\nunmixed is not physically impossible; it is just improbable in the extreme. So\nthe second law is merely probabilistic. Statistically, everything tends toward\nmaximum entropy.\n\nYet probability is enough: enough for the second law to stand as a pillar of\nscience. As Maxwell put it:\n\n> > _Moral_. The 2nd law of Thermodynamics has the same degree of truth as the\n> statement that if you throw a tumblerful of water into the sea, you cannot\n> get the same tumblerful of water out\n> again.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1292629)\n\nThe improbability of heat passing from a colder to a warmer body (without help\nfrom elsewhere) is identical to the improbability of order arranging itself\nfrom disorder (without help from elsewhere). Both, fundamentally, are due only\nto statistics. Counting all the possible ways a system can be arranged, the\ndisorderly ones far outnumber the orderly ones. There are many arrangements,\nor “states,” in which molecules are all jumbled, and few in which they are\nneatly sorted. The orderly states have low probability and low entropy. For\nimpressive degrees of orderliness, the probabilities may be _very_ low. Alan\nTuring once whimsically proposed a number _N_ , defined as “the odds against a\npiece of chalk leaping across the room and writing a line of Shakespeare on\nthe board.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1293185)\n\nEventually physicists began speaking of microstates and macrostates. A\nmacrostate might be: all the gas in the top half of the box. The corresponding\nmicrostates would be all the possible arrangements of all particles—positions\nand velocities. Entropy thus became a physical equivalent of probability: the\nentropy of a given macrostate is the logarithm of the number of its possible\nmicrostates. The second law, then, is the tendency of the universe to flow\nfrom less likely (orderly) to more likely (disorderly) macrostates.\n\nIt was still puzzling, though, to hang so much of physics on a matter of mere\nprobability. Can it be right to say that nothing in physics is stopping a gas\nfrom dividing itself into hot and cold—that it is only a matter of chance and\nstatistics? Maxwell illustrated this conundrum with a thought experiment.\nImagine, he suggested, “a finite being” who stands watch over a tiny hole in\nthe diaphragm dividing the box of gas. This creature can see molecules coming,\ncan tell whether they are fast or slow, and can choose whether or not to let\nthem pass. Thus he could tilt the odds. By sorting fast from slow, he could\nmake side A hotter and side B colder—“and yet no work has been done, only the\nintelligence of a very observant and neat-fingered being has been\nemployed.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1293567) The being defies ordinary\nprobabilities. The chances are, things get mixed together. To sort them out\nrequires information.\n\nThomson loved this idea. He dubbed the notional creature a demon:\n\n![](images/00050.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 9.1)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1936037)\n\n“Maxwell’s intelligent demon,” “Maxwell’s sorting demon,” and soon just\n“Maxwell’s demon.” Thomson waxed eloquent about the little fellow: “He differs\nfrom real living animals only [_only!_] in extreme smallness and\nagility.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1293949) Lecturing to an evening crowd\nat the Royal Institution of Great Britain, with the help of tubes of liquid\ndyed two different colors, Thomson demonstrated the apparently irreversible\nprocess of diffusion and declared that only the demon can counteract it:\n\n> > He can cause one-half of a closed jar of air, or of a bar of iron, to\n> become glowingly hot and the other ice cold; can direct the energy of the\n> moving molecules of a basin of water to throw the water up to a height and\n> leave it there proportionately cooled; can “sort” the molecules in a\n> solution of salt or in a mixture of two gases, so as to reverse the natural\n> process of diffusion, and produce concentration of the solution in one\n> portion of the water, leaving pure water in the remainder of the space\n> occupied; or, in the other case, separate the gases into different parts of\n> the containing vessel.\n\nThe reporter for _The Popular Science Monthly_ thought this was ridiculous.\n“All nature is supposed to be filled with infinite swarms of absurd little\nmicroscopic imps,” he sniffed. “When men like Maxwell, of Cambridge, and\nThomson, of Glasgow, lend their sanction to such a crude hypothetical fancy as\nthat of little devils knocking and kicking the atoms this way and that …, we\nmay well ask, What next?”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1294356) He missed the\npoint. Maxwell had not meant his demon to exist, except as a teaching device.\n\nThe demon sees what we cannot—because we are so gross and slow—namely, that\nthe second law is statistical, not mechanical. At the level of molecules, it\nis violated all the time, here and there, purely by chance. The demon replaces\nchance with purpose. It uses information to reduce entropy. Maxwell never\nimagined how popular his demon would become, nor how long-lived. Henry Adams,\nwho wanted to work some version of entropy into his theory of history, wrote\nto his brother Brooks in 1903, “Clerk Maxwell’s demon who runs the second law\nof Thermo-dynamics ought to be made\nPresident.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1294638) The demon presided over a\ngateway—at first, a magical gateway—from the world of physics to the world of\ninformation.\n\n![](images/00051.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 9.2)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1936296)\n\n![](images/00052.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 9.3)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1936503)\n\n![](images/00053.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 9.4)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1936722)\n\n![](images/00054.jpg)\n\n[(Illustration credit 9.5)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1936933)\n\nScientists envied the demon’s powers. It became a familiar character in\ncartoons enlivening physics journals. To be sure, the creature was a fantasy,\nbut the atom itself had seemed fantastic, and the demon had helped tame it.\nImplacable as the laws of nature now seemed, the demon defied these laws. It\nwas a burglar, picking the lock one molecule at a time. It had “infinitely\nsubtile senses,” wrote Henri Poincaré, and “could turn back the course of the\nuniverse.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1294990) Was this not just what\nhumans dreamed of doing?\n\nThrough their ever better microscopes, scientists of the early twentieth\ncentury examined the active, sorting processes of biological membranes. They\ndiscovered that living cells act as pumps, filters, and factories. Purposeful\nprocesses seemed to operate at tiny scales. Who or what was in control? Life\nitself seemed an organizing force. “Now we must not introduce demonology into\nscience,” wrote the British biologist James Johnstone in 1914. In physics, he\nsaid, individual molecules must remain beyond our control. “These motions and\npaths are un-co-ordinated—‘helter-skelter’—if we like so to term them. Physics\nconsiders only the statistical _mean_ velocities.” That is why the phenomena\nof physics are irreversible, “so that for the latter science Maxwell’s demons\ndo not exist.” But what of life? What of physiology? The processes of\nterrestrial life _are_ reversible, he argued. “We must therefore seek for\nevidence that the organism _can_ control the, otherwise, un-co-ordinated\nmotions of the individual molecules.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1295284)\n\n> > Is it not strange that while we see that most of our human effort is that\n> of _directing_ natural agencies and energies into paths which they would not\n> otherwise take, we should yet have failed to think of primitive organisms,\n> or even of the tissue elements in the bodies of the higher organisms, as\n> possessing also the power of directing physico-chemical processes?\n\nWhen life remained so mysterious, maybe Maxwell’s demon was not just a\ncartoon.\n\nThen the demon began to haunt Leó Szilárd, a very young Hungarian physicist\nwith a productive imagination who would later conceive the electron microscope\nand, not incidentally, the nuclear chain reaction. One of his more famous\nteachers, Albert Einstein, advised him out of avuncular protectiveness to take\na paying job with the patent office, but Szilárd ignored the advice. He was\nthinking in the 1920s about how thermodynamics should deal with incessant\nmolecular fluctuations. By definition, fluctuations ran counter to averages,\nlike fish swimming momentarily upstream, and people naturally wondered: what\nif you could harness them? This irresistible idea led to a version of the\nperpetual motion machine, _perpetuum mobile_ , holy grail of cranks and\nhucksters. It was another way of saying, “All that heat—why can’t we use it?”\n\nIt was also another of the paradoxes engendered by Maxwell’s demon. In a\nclosed system, a demon who could catch the fast molecules and let the slow\nmolecules pass would have a source of useful energy, continually refreshed.\nOr, if not the chimerical imp, what about some other “intelligent being”? An\nexperimental physicist, perhaps? A perpetual motion machine should be\npossible, declared Szilárd, “if we view the experimenting man as a sort of\ndeus ex machina, one who is continuously informed of the existing state of\nnature.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1295569) For his version of the thought\nexperiment, Szilárd made clear that he did not wish to invoke a living demon,\nwith, say, a brain—biology brought troubles of its own. “The very existence of\na nervous system,” he noted, “is dependent on continual dissipation of\nenergy.” (His friend Carl Eckart pithily rephrased this: “Thinking generates\nentropy.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1296232)) Instead he proposed a\n“nonliving device,” intervening in a model thermodynamic system, operating a\npiston in a cylinder of fluid. He pointed out that this device would need, in\neffect, “a sort of memory faculty.” (Alan Turing was now, in 1929, a teenager.\nIn Turing’s terms, Szilárd was treating the mind of the demon as a computer\nwith a two-state memory.)\n\nSzilárd showed that even this perpetual motion machine would have to fail.\nWhat was the catch? Simply put: information is not free. Maxwell, Thomson, and\nthe rest had implicitly talked as though knowledge was there for the\ntaking—knowledge of the velocities and trajectories of molecules coming and\ngoing before the demon’s eyes. They did not consider the cost of this\ninformation. They could not; for them, in a simpler time, it was as if the\ninformation belonged to a parallel universe, an astral plane, not linked to\nthe universe of matter and energy, particles and forces, whose behavior they\nwere learning to calculate.\n\nBut information is physical. Maxwell’s demon makes the link. The demon\nperforms a conversion between information and energy, one particle at a time.\nSzilárd—who did not yet use the word _information_ —found that, if he\naccounted exactly for each measurement and memory, then the conversion could\nbe computed exactly. So he computed it. He calculated that each unit of\ninformation brings a corresponding increase in entropy—specifically, by _k_\nlog 2 units. Every time the demon makes a choice between one particle and\nanother, it costs one bit of information. The payback comes at the end of the\ncycle, when it has to clear its memory (Szilárd did not specify this last\ndetail in words, but in mathematics). Accounting for this properly is the only\nway to eliminate the paradox of perpetual motion, to bring the universe back\ninto harmony, to “restore concordance with the Second Law.”\n\nSzilárd had thus closed a loop leading to Shannon’s conception of entropy as\ninformation. For his part, Shannon did not read German and did not follow\n_Zeitschrift für Physik_. “I think actually Szilárd was thinking of this,” he\nsaid much later, “and he talked to von Neumann about it, and von Neumann may\nhave talked to Wiener about it. But none of these people actually talked to me\nabout it.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1296504) Shannon reinvented the\nmathematics of entropy nonetheless.\n\nTo the physicist, entropy is a measure of uncertainty about the state of a\nphysical system: one state among all the possible states it can be in. These\nmicrostates may not be equally likely, so the physicist writes _S_ _=_ −Σ _p_\n_i_ log _p_ _i_.\n\nTo the information theorist, entropy is a measure of uncertainty about a\nmessage: one message among all the possible messages that a communications\nsource can produce. The possible messages may not be equally likely, so\nShannon wrote _H =_ −Σ _p_ _i_ log _p_ _i_.\n\nIt is not just a coincidence of formalism: nature providing similar answers to\nsimilar problems. It is all one problem. To reduce entropy in a box of gas, to\nperform useful work, one pays a price in information. Likewise, a particular\nmessage reduces the entropy in the ensemble of possible messages—in terms of\ndynamical systems, a phase space.\n\nThat was how Shannon saw it. Wiener’s version was slightly different. It was\nfitting—for a word that began by meaning the opposite of itself—that these\ncolleagues and rivals placed opposite signs on their formulations of entropy.\nWhere Shannon identified information with entropy, Wiener said it was\n_negative_ entropy. Wiener was saying that information meant order, but an\norderly thing does not necessarily embody much information. Shannon himself\npointed out their difference and minimized it, calling it a sort of\n“mathematical pun.” They get the same numerical answers, he noted:\n\n> > I consider how much information is _produced_ when a choice is made from a\n> set—the larger the set the _more_ information. You consider the larger\n> uncertainty in the case of a larger set to mean less knowledge of the\n> situation and hence _less_\n> information.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1296928)\n\nPut another way, _H_ is a measure of surprise. Put yet another way, _H_ is the\naverage number of yes-no questions needed to guess the unknown message.\nShannon had it right—at least, his approach proved fertile for mathematicians\nand physicists a generation later—but the confusion lingered for some years.\nOrder and disorder still needed some sorting.\n\nWe all behave like Maxwell’s demon. Organisms organize. In everyday experience\nlies the reason sober physicists across two centuries kept this cartoon\nfantasy alive. We sort the mail, build sand castles, solve jigsaw puzzles,\nseparate wheat from chaff, rearrange chess pieces, collect stamps, alphabetize\nbooks, create symmetry, compose sonnets and sonatas, and put our rooms in\norder, and to do all this requires no great energy, as long as we can apply\nintelligence. We propagate structure (not just we humans but we who are\nalive). We disturb the tendency toward equilibrium. It would be absurd to\nattempt a thermodynamic accounting for such processes, but it is not absurd to\nsay we are reducing entropy, piece by piece. Bit by bit. The original demon,\ndiscerning one molecule at a time, distinguishing fast from slow, and\noperating his little gateway, is sometimes described as “superintelligent,”\nbut compared to a real organism it is an idiot savant. Not only do living\nthings lessen the disorder in their environments; they are in themselves,\ntheir skeletons and their flesh, vesicles and membranes, shells and carapaces,\nleaves and blossoms, circulatory systems and metabolic pathways—miracles of\npattern and structure. It sometimes seems as if curbing entropy is our\nquixotic purpose in this universe.\n\nIn 1943 Erwin Schrödinger, the chain-smoking, bow-tied pioneer of quantum\nphysics, asked to deliver the Statutory Public Lectures at Trinity College,\nDublin, decided the time had come to answer one of the greatest of\nunanswerable questions: What is life? The equation bearing his name was the\nessential formulation of quantum mechanics. In looking beyond his field, as\nmiddle-aged Nobel laureates so often do, Schrödinger traded rigor for\nspeculation and began by apologizing “that some of us should venture to embark\non a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete\nknowledge of some of them—and at the risk of making fools of\nourselves.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1297259) Nonetheless, the little\nbook he made from these lectures became influential. Without discovering or\neven stating anything new, it laid a foundation for a nascent science, as yet\nunnamed, combining genetics and biochemistry. “Schrödinger’s book became a\nkind of _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_ of the revolution in biology that, when the dust\nhad cleared, left molecular biology as its\nlegacy,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1297554) one of the discipline’s\nfounders wrote later. Biologists had not read anything like it before, and\nphysicists took it as a signal that the next great problems might lie in\nbiology.\n\nSchrödinger began with what he called the enigma of biological stability. In\nnotable contrast to a box of gas, with its vagaries of probability and\nfluctuation, and in seeming disregard of Schrödinger’s own wave mechanics,\nwhere uncertainty is the rule, the structures of a living creature exhibit\nremarkable permanence. They persist, both in the life of the organism and\nacross generations, through heredity. This struck Schrödinger as requiring\nexplanation.\n\n“When is a piece of matter said to be\nalive?”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1297934) he asked. He skipped past the\nusual suggestions—growth, feeding, reproduction—and answered as simply as\npossible: “When it goes on ‘doing something,’ moving, exchanging material with\nits environment, and so forth, for a much longer period than we would expect\nan inanimate piece of matter to ‘keep going’ under similar circumstances.”\nOrdinarily, a piece of matter comes to a standstill; a box of gas reaches a\nuniform temperature; a chemical system “fades away into a dead, inert lump of\nmatter”—one way or another, the second law is obeyed and maximum entropy is\nreached. Living things manage to remain unstable. Norbert Wiener pursued this\nthought in _Cybernetics:_ enzymes, he wrote, may be “metastable” Maxwell’s\ndemons—meaning not quite stable, or precariously stable. “The stable state of\nan enzyme is to be deconditioned,” he noted, “and the stable state of a living\norganism is to be dead.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1298209)\n\nSchrödinger felt that evading the second law for a while, or seeming to, is\nexactly why a living creature “appears so enigmatic.” The organism’s ability\nto feign perpetual motion leads so many people to believe in a special,\nsupernatural _life force_. He mocked this idea— _vis viva_ or entelechy—and he\nalso mocked the popular notion that organisms “feed upon energy.” Energy and\nmatter were just two sides of a coin, and anyway one calorie is as good as\nanother. No, he said: the organism feeds upon negative entropy.\n\n“To put it less paradoxically,” he added paradoxically, “the essential thing\nin metabolism is that the organism succeeds in freeing itself from all the\nentropy it cannot help producing while\nalive.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1298530)\n\nIn other words, the organism sucks orderliness from its surroundings.\nHerbivores and carnivores dine on a smorgasbord of structure; they feed on\norganic compounds, matter in a well-ordered state, and return it “in a very\nmuch degraded form—not entirely degraded, however, for plants can make use of\nit.” Plants meanwhile draw not just energy but negative entropy from sunlight.\nIn terms of energy, the accounting can be more or less rigorously performed.\nIn terms of order, calculations are not so simple. The mathematical reckoning\nof order and chaos remains more ticklish, the relevant definitions being\nsubject to feedback loops of their own.\n\nMuch more remained to be learned, Schrödinger said, about how life stores and\nperpetuates the orderliness it draws from nature. Biologists with their\nmicroscopes had learned a great deal about cells. They could see gametes—sperm\ncells and egg cells. Inside them were the rodlike fibers called chromosomes,\narranged in pairs, with consistent numbers from species to species, and known\nto be carriers of hereditary features. As Schrödinger put it now, they hold\nwithin them, somehow, the “pattern” of the organism: “It is these chromosomes,\nor probably only an axial skeleton fibre of what we actually see under the\nmicroscope as the chromosome, that contain in some kind of code-script the\nentire pattern of the individual’s future development.” He considered it\namazing—mysterious, but surely crucial in some way as yet unknown—that every\nsingle cell of an organism “should be in possession of a complete (double)\ncopy of the code-script.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1298755) He compared\nthis to an army in which every soldier knows every detail of the general’s\nplans.\n\nThese details were the many discrete “properties” of an organism, though it\nremained far from clear what a property entailed. (“It seems neither adequate\nnor possible to dissect into discrete ‘properties’ the pattern of an organism\nwhich is essentially a unity, a ‘whole,’\n”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1298954) Schrödinger mused.) The color of an\nanimal’s eyes, blue or brown, might be a property, but it is more useful to\nfocus on the _difference_ from one individual to another, and this difference\nwas understood to be controlled by something conveyed in the chromosomes. He\nused the term _gene:_ “the hypothetical material carrier of a definite\nhereditary feature.” No one could yet see these hypothetical genes, but surely\nthe time was not far off. Microscopic observations made it possible to\nestimate their size: perhaps 100 or 150 atomic distances; perhaps one thousand\natoms or fewer. Yet somehow these tiny entities must encapsulate the entire\npattern of a living creature—a fly or a rhododendron, a mouse or a human. And\nwe must understand this pattern as a four-dimensional object: the structure of\nthe organism through the whole of its ontogenetic development, every stage\nfrom embryo to adult.\n\nIn seeking a clue to the gene’s molecular structure, it seemed natural to look\nto the most organized forms of matter, crystals. Solids in crystalline form\nhave a relative permanence; they can begin with a tiny germ and build up\nlarger and larger structures; and quantum mechanics was beginning to give deep\ninsight into the forces involved in their bonding. But Schrödinger felt\nsomething was missing. Crystals are _too_ orderly—built up in “the\ncomparatively dull way of repeating the same structure in three directions\nagain and again.” Elaborate though they seem, crystalline solids contain just\na few types of atoms. Life must depend on a higher level of complexity,\nstructure without predictable repetition, he argued. He invented a term:\n_aperiodic crystals_. This was his hypothesis: _We believe a gene—or perhaps\nthe whole chromosome fiber—to be an aperiodic\nsolid_.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1299148) He could hardly emphasize\nenough the glory of this difference, between periodic and aperiodic:\n\n> > The difference in structure is of the same kind as that between an\n> ordinary wallpaper in which the same pattern is repeated again and again in\n> regular periodicity and a masterpiece of embroidery, say a Raphael tapestry,\n> which shows no dull repetition, but an elaborate, coherent, _meaningful_\n> design.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1299410)\n\nSome of his most admiring readers, such as Léon Brillouin, the French\nphysicist recently decamped to the United States, said that Schrödinger was\ntoo clever to be completely convincing, even as they demonstrated in their own\nwork just how convinced they were. Brillouin was particularly taken with the\ncomparison to crystals, with their elaborate but inanimate structures.\nCrystals have some capacity for self-repair, he noted; under stress, their\natoms may shift to new positions for the sake of equilibrium. That may be\nunderstood in terms of thermodynamics and now quantum mechanics. How much more\nexalted, then, is self-repair in the organism: “The living organism heals its\nown wounds, cures its sicknesses, and may rebuild large portions of its\nstructure when they have been destroyed by some accident. This is the most\nstriking and unexpected behavior.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1299606) He\nfollowed Schrödinger, too, in using entropy to connect the smallest and\nlargest scales.\n\n> > The earth is not a closed system, and life feeds upon energy and negative\n> entropy leaking into the earth system.… The cycle reads: first, creation of\n> unstable equilibriums (fuels, food, waterfalls, etc.); then use of these\n> reserves by all living creatures.\n\nLiving creatures confound the usual computation of entropy. More generally, so\ndoes information. “Take an issue of _The New York Times_ , the book on\ncybernetics, and an equal weight of scrap paper,” suggested Brillouin. “Do\nthey have the same entropy?” If you are feeding the furnace, yes. But not if\nyou are a reader. There is entropy in the arrangement of the ink spots.\n\nFor that matter, physicists themselves go around transforming negative entropy\ninto information, said Brillouin. From observations and measurements, the\nphysicist derives scientific laws; with these laws, people create machines\nnever seen in nature, with the most improbable structures. He wrote this in\n1950, as he was leaving Harvard to join the IBM Corporation in\nPoughkeepsie.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1299871)\n\nThat was not the end for Maxwell’s demon—far from it. The problem could not\ntruly be solved, the demon effectively banished without a deeper understanding\nof a realm far removed from thermodynamics: mechanical computing. Later, Peter\nLandsberg wrote its obituary this way: “Maxwell’s demon died at the age of 62\n(when a paper by Leó Szilárd appeared), but it continues to haunt the castles\nof physics as a restless and lovable\npoltergeist.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1300205)\n\n\n# 10 | LIFE’S OWN CODE\n\n\n##\n\n> (The Organism Is Written in the Egg)\n\n> _What lies at the heart of every living thing is not a fire, not warm\n> breath, not a “spark of life.” It is information, words, instructions.

If traits are handed down from\none generation to the next, these traits must take some primal form or have\nsome carrier. Hence the putative particle of protoplasm. “The biologist must\nbe allowed as much scientific use of the imagination as the physicist,” _The\nPopular Science Monthly_ explained in 1875. “If the one must have his atoms\nand molecules, the other must have his physiological units, his plastic\nmolecules, his ‘plasticules.’ ”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1300852)\n\n_Plasticule_ did not catch on, and almost everyone had the wrong idea about\nheredity anyway. So in 1910 a Danish botanist, Wilhelm Johannsen, self-\nconsciously invented the word _gene_. He was at pains to correct the common\nmythology and thought a word might help. The myth was this: that “personal\nqualities” are transmitted from parent to progeny. This is “the most naïve and\noldest conception of heredity,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1301152)\nJohanssen said in a speech to the American Society of Naturalists. It was\nunderstandable. If father and daughter are fat, people might be tempted to\nthink that his fatness caused hers, or that he passed it on to her. But that\nis wrong. As Johannsen declared, “The _personal qualities_ of any individual\norganism do not at all cause the qualities of its offspring; but the qualities\nof both ancestor and descendent are in quite the same manner determined by the\nnature of the ‘sexual substances’—i.e., the gametes—from which they have\ndeveloped.” What is inherited is more abstract, more in the nature of\npotentiality.\n\nTo banish the fallacious thinking, he proposed a new terminology, beginning\nwith _gene_ : “nothing but a very applicable little word, easily combined with\nothers.”* It hardly mattered that neither he nor anyone else knew what a gene\nactually was; “it may be useful as an expression for the ‘unit-factors,’\n‘elements,’ or ‘allelomorphs.’… As to the nature of the ‘genes’ it is as yet\nof no value to propose a hypothesis.” Gregor Mendel’s years of research with\ngreen and yellow peas showed that such a thing must exist. Colors and other\ntraits vary depending on many factors, such as temperature and soil content,\nbut _something_ is preserved whole; it does not blend or diffuse; it must be\nquantized.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1301463) Mendel had discovered the\ngene, though he did not name it. For him it was more an algebraic convenience\nthan a physical entity.\n\nWhen Schrödinger contemplated the gene, he faced a problem. How could such a\n“tiny speck of material” contain the entire complex code-script that\ndetermines the elaborate development of the organism? To resolve the\ndifficulty Schrödinger summoned an example not from wave mechanics or\ntheoretical physics but from telegraphy: Morse code. He noted that two signs,\ndot and dash, could be combined in well-ordered groups to generate all human\nlanguage. Genes, too, he suggested, must employ a code: “The miniature code\nshould precisely correspond with a highly complicated and specified plan of\ndevelopment and should somehow contain the means to put it into\naction.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1301792)\n\nCodes, instructions, signals—all this language, redolent of machinery and\nengineering, pressed in on biologists like Norman French invading medieval\nEnglish. In the 1940s the jargon had a precious, artificial feeling, but that\nsoon passed. The new molecular biology began to examine information storage\nand information transfer. Biologists could count in terms of “bits.” Some of\nthe physicists now turning to biology saw information as exactly the concept\nneeded to discuss and measure biological qualities for which tools had not\nbeen available: complexity and order, organization and\nspecificity.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1302093) Henry Quastler, an early\nradiologist from Vienna, then at the University of Illinois, was applying\ninformation theory to both biology and psychology; he estimated that an amino\nacid has the information content of a written word and a protein molecule the\ninformation content of a paragraph. His colleague Sidney Dancoff suggested to\nhim in 1950 that a chromosomal thread is “a linear coded tape of\ninformation”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1302393):\n\n> > The entire thread constitutes a “message.” This message can be broken down\n> into sub-units which may be called “paragraphs,” “words,” etc. The smallest\n> message unit is perhaps some flip-flop which can make a yes-no decision.\n\nIn 1952 Quastler organized a symposium on information theory in biology, with\nno purpose but to deploy these new ideas—entropy, noise, messaging,\ndifferentiating—in areas from cell structure and enzyme catalysis to large-\nscale “biosystems.” One researcher constructed an estimate of the number of\nbits represented by a single bacterium: as much as\n1013.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1302767) (But that was the number needed\nto describe its entire molecular structure in three dimensions—perhaps there\nwas a more economical description.) The growth of the bacterium could be\nanalyzed as a reduction in the entropy of its part of the universe. Quastler\nhimself wanted to take the measure of higher organisms in terms of information\ncontent: not in terms of atoms (“this would be extremely wasteful”) but in\nterms of “hypothetical instructions to build an\norganism.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1303111) This brought him, of course,\nto genes.\n\nThe whole set of instructions—situated “somewhere in the chromosomes”—is the\ngenome. This is a “catalogue,” he said, containing, if not all, then at least\n“a substantial fraction of all information about an adult organism.” He\nemphasized, though, how little was known about genes. Were they discrete\nphysical entities, or did they overlap? Were they “independent sources of\ninformation” or did they affect one another? How many were there? Multiplying\nall these unknowns, he arrived at a result:\n\n> > that the essential complexity of a single cell and of a whole man are both\n> not more than 1012 nor less than 105 bits; this is an extremely coarse\n> estimate, but is better than no estimate at\n> all.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1303499)\n\nThese crude efforts led to nothing, directly. Shannon’s information theory\ncould not be grafted onto biology whole. It hardly mattered. A seismic shift\nwas already under way: from thinking about energy to thinking about\ninformation.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, an odd little letter arrived at the offices of the\njournal _Nature_ in London in the spring of 1953, with a list of signatories\nfrom Paris, Zurich, Cambridge, and Geneva, most notably Boris Ephrussi,\nFrance’s first professor of genetics.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1303697)\nThe scientists complained of “what seems to us a rather chaotic growth in\ntechnical vocabulary.” In particular, they had seen genetic recombination in\nbacteria described as “transformation,” “induction,” “transduction,” and even\n“infection.” They proposed to simplify matters:\n\n> > As a solution to this confusing situation, we would like to suggest the\n> use of the term “interbacterial information” to replace those above. It does\n> not imply necessarily the transfer of material substances, and recognizes\n> the possible future importance of cybernetics at the bacterial level.\n\nThis was the product of a wine-flushed lakeside lunch at Locarno,\nSwitzerland—meant as a joke, but entirely plausible to the editors of _Nature_\n, who published it forthwith.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1304000) The\nyoungest of the lunchers and signers was a twenty-five-year-old American named\nJames Watson.\n\nThe very next issue of _Nature_ carried another letter from Watson, along with\nhis collaborator, Francis Crick. It made them famous. They had found the gene.\n\nA consensus had emerged that whatever genes were, however they functioned,\nthey would probably be proteins: giant organic molecules made of long chains\nof amino acids. Alternatively, a few geneticists in the 1940s focused instead\non simple viruses—phages. Then again, experiments on heredity in bacteria had\npersuaded a few researchers, Watson and Crick among them, that genes might lie\nin a different substance, which, for no known reason, was found within the\nnucleus of every cell, plant and animal, phages\nincluded.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1304644) This substance was a nucleic\nacid, particularly deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The people working with\nnucleic acids, mainly chemists, had not been able to learn much about it,\nexcept that the molecules were built up from smaller units, called\nnucleotides. Watson and Crick thought this must be the secret, and they raced\nto figure out its structure at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. They\ncould not see these molecules; they could only seek clues in the shadows cast\nby X-ray diffraction. But they knew a great deal about the subunits. Each\nnucleotide contained a “base,” and there were just four different bases,\ndesignated as A, C, G, and T. They came in strictly predictable proportions.\nThey must be the letters of the code. The rest was trial and error, fired by\nimagination.\n\nWhat they discovered became an icon: the double helix, heralded on magazine\ncovers, emulated in sculpture. DNA is formed of two long sequences of bases,\nlike ciphers coded in a four-letter alphabet, each sequence complementary to\nthe other, coiled together. Unzipped, each strand may serve as a template for\nreplication. (Was it Schrödinger’s “aperiodic crystal”? In terms of physical\nstructure, X-ray diffraction showed DNA to be entirely regular. The\naperiodicity lies at the abstract level of language—the sequence of\n“letters.”) In the local pub, Crick, ebullient, announced to anyone who would\nlisten that they had discovered “the secret of life”; in their one-page note\nin _Nature_ they were more circumspect. They ended with a remark that has been\ncalled “one of the most coy statements in the literature of\nscience”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1304984):\n\n> > It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated\n> immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic\n> material.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1305232)\n\nThey dispensed with the timidity in another paper a few weeks later. In each\nchain the sequence of bases appeared to be irregular—any sequence was\npossible, they observed. “It follows that in a long molecule many different\npermutations are possible.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1305532) Many\npermutations—many possible messages. Their next remark set alarms sounding on\nboth sides of the Atlantic: “It therefore seems likely that the precise\nsequence of the bases is the code which carries the genetical information.” In\nusing these terms, _code_ and _information_ , they were no longer speaking\nfiguratively.\n\nThe macromolecules of organic life embody information in an intricate\nstructure. A single hemoglobin molecule comprises four chains of polypeptides,\ntwo with 141 amino acids and two with 146, in strict linear sequence, bonded\nand folded together. Atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and iron could mingle\nrandomly for the lifetime of the universe and be no more likely to form\nhemoglobin than the proverbial chimpanzees to type the works of Shakespeare.\nTheir genesis requires energy; they are built up from simpler, less patterned\nparts, and the law of entropy applies. For earthly life, the energy comes as\nphotons from the sun. The information comes via evolution.\n\nThe DNA molecule was special: the information it bears is its only function.\nHaving recognized this, microbiologists turned to the problem of deciphering\nthe code. Crick, who had been inspired to leave physics for biology when he\nread Schrödinger’s _What Is Life?_ , sent Schrödinger a copy of the paper but\ndid not receive a reply.\n\nOn the other hand, George Gamow saw the Watson-Crick report when he was\nvisiting the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley. Gamow was a Ukrainian-born\ncosmologist—an originator of the Big Bang theory—and he knew a big idea when\nhe saw one. He sent off a letter:\n\n> Dear Drs. Watson & Crick,\n\n> I am a physicist, not a biologist.… But I am very much excited by your\n> article in May 30th _Nature_ , and think that brings Biology over into the\n> group of “exact” sciences.… If your point of view is correct each organism\n> will be characterized by a long number written in quadrucal (?) system with\n> figures 1, 2, 3, 4 standing for different bases.… This would open a very\n> exciting possibility of theoretical research based on combinatorix and the\n> theory of numbers!… I have a feeling this can be done. What do you\n> think?[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1305861)\n\nFor the next decade, the struggle to understand the genetic code consumed a\nmotley assortment of the world’s great minds, many of them, like Gamow,\nlacking any useful knowledge of biochemistry. For Watson and Crick, the\ninitial problem had depended on a morass of specialized particulars: hydrogen\nbonds, salt linkages, phosphate-sugar chains with deoxyribofuranose residues.\nThey had to learn how inorganic ions could be organized in three dimensions;\nthey had to calculate exact angles of chemical bonds. They made models out of\ncardboard and tin plates. But now the problem was being transformed into an\nabstract game of symbol manipulation. Closely linked to DNA, its single-\nstranded cousin, RNA, appeared to play the role of messenger or translator.\nGamow said explicitly that the underlying chemistry hardly mattered. He and\nothers who followed him understood this as a puzzle in mathematics—a mapping\nbetween messages in different alphabets. If this was a coding problem, the\ntools they needed came from combinatorics and information theory. Along with\nphysicists, they consulted cryptanalysts.\n\nGamow himself began impulsively by designing a combinatorial code. As he saw\nit, the problem was to get from the four bases in DNA to the twenty known\namino acids in proteins—a code, therefore, with four letters and twenty\nwords.* Pure combinatorics made him think of nucleotide triplets: three-letter\nwords. He had a detailed solution—soon known as his “diamond code”—published\nin _Nature_ within a few months. A few months after that, Crick showed this to\nbe utterly wrong: experimental data on protein sequences ruled out the diamond\ncode. But Gamow was not giving up. The triplet idea was seductive. An\nunexpected cast of scientists joined the hunt: Max Delbrück, an ex-physicist\nnow at Caltech in biology; his friend Richard Feynman, the quantum theorist;\nEdward Teller, the famous bomb maker; another Los Alamos alumnus, the\nmathematician Nicholas Metropolis; and Sydney Brenner, who joined Crick at the\nCavendish.\n\nThey all had different coding ideas. Mathematically the problem seemed\ndaunting even to Gamow. “As in the breaking of enemy messages during the war,”\nhe wrote in 1954, “the success depends on the available length of the coded\ntext. As every intelligence officer will tell you, the work is very hard, and\nthe success depends mostly on luck.… I am afraid that the problem cannot be\nsolved without the help of electronic\ncomputer.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1306207) Gamow and Watson decided to\nmake it a club: the RNA Tie Club, with exactly twenty members. Each member\nreceived a woolen tie in black and green, made to Gamow’s design by a\nhaberdasher in Los Angeles. The game playing aside, Gamow wanted to create a\ncommunication channel to bypass journal publication. News in science had never\nmoved so fast. “Many of the essential concepts were first proposed in informal\ndiscussions on both sides of the Atlantic and were then quickly broadcast to\nthe cognoscenti,” said another member, Gunther Stent, “by private\ninternational bush telegraph.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1306441) There\nwere false starts, wild guesses, and dead ends, and the established\nbiochemistry community did not always go along willingly.\n\n“People didn’t necessarily _believe_ in the code,” Crick said later. “The\nmajority of biochemists simply weren’t thinking along those lines. It was a\ncompletely novel idea, and moreover they were inclined to think it was\noversimplified.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1306669) They thought the way\nto understand proteins would be to study enzyme systems and the coupling of\npeptide units. Which was reasonable enough.\n\n> > They thought protein synthesis couldn’t be a simple matter of coding from\n> one thing to another; that sounded too much like something a _physicist_ had\n> invented. It didn’t sound like biochemistry to _them.…_ So there was a\n> certain resistance to simple ideas like three nucleotides’ coding an amino\n> acid; people thought it was rather like cheating.\n\nGamow, at the other extreme, was bypassing the biochemical details to put\nforward an idea of shocking simplicity: that any living organism is determined\nby “a long number written in a four-digital\nsystem.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1307163) He called this “the number of\nthe beast” (from Revelation). If two beasts have the same number, they are\nidentical twins.\n\nBy now the word _code_ was so deeply embedded in the conversation that people\nseldom paused to notice how extraordinary it was to find such a thing—abstract\nsymbols representing arbitrarily different abstract symbols—at work in\nchemistry, at the level of molecules. The genetic code performed a function\nwith uncanny similarities to the metamathematical code invented by Gödel for\nhis philosophical purposes. Gödel’s code substitutes plain numbers for\nmathematical expressions and operations; the genetic code uses triplets of\nnucleotides to represent amino acids. Douglas Hofstadter was the first to make\nthis connection explicitly, in the 1980s: “between the complex machinery in a\nliving cell that enables a DNA molecule to replicate itself and the clever\nmachinery in a mathematical system that enables a formula to say things about\nitself.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1307489) In both cases he saw a twisty\nfeedback loop. “Nobody had ever in the least suspected that one set of\nchemicals could _code_ for another set,” Hofstadter wrote.\n\n> > Indeed, the very idea is somewhat baffling: If there is a code, then who\n> invented it? What kinds of messages are written in it? Who writes them? Who\n> reads them?\n\nThe Tie Club recognized that the problem was not just information storage but\ninformation transfer. DNA serves two different functions. First, it preserves\ninformation. It does this by copying itself, from generation to generation,\nspanning eons—a Library of Alexandria that keeps its data safe by copying\nitself billions of times. Notwithstanding the beautiful double helix, this\ninformation store is essentially one-dimensional: a string of elements arrayed\nin a line. In human DNA, the nucleotide units number more than a billion, and\nthis detailed gigabit message must be conserved perfectly, or almost\nperfectly. Second, however, DNA also sends that information outward for use in\nthe making of the organism. The data stored in a one-dimensional strand has to\nflower forth in three dimensions. This information transfer occurs via\nmessages passing from the nucleic acids to proteins. So DNA not only\nreplicates itself; separately, it dictates the manufacture of something\nentirely different. These proteins, with their own enormous complexity, serve\nas the material of a body, the mortar and bricks, and also as the control\nsystem, the plumbing and wiring and the chemical signals that control growth.\n\nThe replication of DNA is a copying of information. The manufacture of\nproteins is a transfer of information: the sending of a message. Biologists\ncould see this clearly now, because the _message_ was now well defined and\nabstracted from any particular substrate. If messages could be borne upon\nsound waves or electrical pulses, why not by chemical processes?\n\nGamow framed the issue simply: “The nucleus of a living cell is a storehouse\nof information.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1307875) Furthermore, he said,\nit is a transmitter of information. The continuity of all life stems from this\n“information system”; the proper study of genetics is “the language of the\ncells.”\n\nWhen Gamow’s diamond code proved wrong, he tried a “triangle code,” and more\nvariations followed—also wrong. Triplet codons remained central, and a\nsolution seemed tantalizingly close but out of reach. A problem was how nature\npunctuated the seemingly unbroken DNA and RNA strands. No one could see a\nbiological equivalent for the pauses that separate letters in Morse code, or\nthe spaces that separate words. Perhaps every fourth base was a comma. Or\nmaybe (Crick suggested) commas would be unnecessary if some triplets made\n“sense” and others made “nonsense.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1308211)\nThen again, maybe a sort of tape reader just needed to start at a certain\npoint and count off the nucleotides three by three. Among the mathematicians\ndrawn to this problem were a group at the new Jet Propulsion Laboratory in\nPasadena, California, meant to be working on aerospace research. To them it\nlooked like a classic problem in Shannon coding theory: “the sequence of\nnucleotides as an infinite message, written without punctuation, from which\nany finite portion must be decodable into a sequence of amino acids by\nsuitable insertion of commas.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1308521) They\nconstructed a _dictionary_ of codes. They considered the problem of\n_misprints_.\n\nBiochemistry did matter. All the world’s cryptanalysts, lacking petri dishes\nand laboratory kitchens, would not have been able to guess from among the\nuniverse of possible answers. When the genetic code was solved, in the early\n1960s, it turned out to be full of redundancy. Much of the mapping from\nnucleotides to amino acids seemed arbitrary—not as neatly patterned as any of\nGamow’s proposals. Some amino acids correspond to just one codon, others to\ntwo, four, or six. Particles called ribosomes ratchet along the RNA strand and\ntranslate it, three bases at a time. Some codons are redundant; some actually\nserve as start signals and stop signals. The redundancy serves exactly the\npurpose that an information theorist would expect. It provides tolerance for\nerrors. Noise affects biological messages like any other. Errors in\nDNA—misprints—are mutations.\n\nEven before the exact answer was reached, Crick crystallized its fundamental\nprinciples in a statement that he called (and is called to this day) the\nCentral Dogma. It is a hypothesis about the direction of evolution and the\norigin of life; it is provable in terms of Shannon entropy in the possible\nchemical alphabets:\n\n> > Once “information” has passed into protein it _cannot get out again_.

Information means\n> here the _precise_ determination of\n> sequence.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1308937)\n\nThe genetic message is independent and impenetrable: no information from\nevents outside can change it.\n\nInformation had never been writ so small. Here is scripture at angstrom scale,\npublished where no one can see, the Book of Life in the eye of a needle.\n\n_Omne vivum ex ovo_. “The complete description of the organism is already\nwritten in the egg,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1309526) said Sydney\nBrenner to Horace Freeland Judson, molecular biology’s great chronicler, at\nCambridge in the winter of 1971. “Inside every animal there is an internal\ndescription of that animal.… What is going to be difficult is the immense\namount of detail that will have to be subsumed. The most economical language\nof description is the molecular, genetic description that is already there. We\ndo not yet know, in that language, what the _names_ are. What does the\norganism name _to itself_? We cannot say that an organism has, for example, a\nname for a finger. There’s no guarantee that in making a hand, the explanation\ncan be couched in the terms we use for making a glove.”\n\nBrenner was in a thoughtful mood, drinking sherry before dinner at King’s\nCollege. When he began working with Crick, less than two decades before,\nmolecular biology did not even have a name. Two decades later, in the 1990s,\nscientists worldwide would undertake the mapping of the entire human genome:\nperhaps 20,000 genes, 3 billion base pairs. What was the most fundamental\nchange? It was a shift of the frame, from energy and matter to information.\n\n“All of biochemistry up to the fifties was concerned with where you get the\nenergy and the materials for cell function,” Brenner said. “Biochemists only\nthought about the flux of energy and the flow of matter. Molecular biologists\nstarted to talk about the flux of information. Looking back, one can see that\nthe double helix brought the realization that information in biological\nsystems could be studied in much the same way as energy and matter.…\n\n“Look,” he told Judson, “let me give you an example. If you went to a\nbiologist twenty years ago and asked him, How do you make a protein, he would\nhave said, Well, that’s a horrible problem, I don’t know … but the important\nquestion is where do you get the energy to make the peptide bond. Whereas the\nmolecular biologist would have said, That’s not the problem, the important\nproblem is where do you get the instructions to assemble the sequence of amino\nacids, and to hell with the energy; the energy will look after itself.”\n\nBy this time, the technical jargon of biologists included the words _alphabet,\nlibrary, editing, proofreading, transcription, translation, nonsense, synonym_\n, and _redundancy_. Genetics and DNA had drawn the attention not just of\ncryptographers but of classical linguists. Certain proteins, capable of\nflipping from one relatively stable state to another, were found to act as\nrelays, accepting ciphered commands and passing them to their\nneighbors—switching stations in three-dimensional communications networks.\nBrenner, looking forward, thought the focus would turn to computer science as\nwell. He envisioned a science—though it did not yet have a name—of chaos and\ncomplexity. “I think in the next twenty-five years we are going to have to\nteach biologists another language still,” he said. “I don’t know what it’s\ncalled yet; nobody knows. But what one is aiming at, I think, is the\nfundamental problem of the theory of elaborate systems.” He recalled John von\nNeumann, at the dawn of information theory and cybernetics, proposing to\nunderstand biological processes and mental processes in terms of how a\ncomputing machine might operate. “In other words,” said Brenner, “where a\nscience like physics works in terms of laws, or a science like molecular\nbiology, to now, is stated in terms of mechanisms, maybe now what one has to\nbegin to think of is algorithms. Recipes. Procedures.”\n\nIf you want to know what a mouse is, ask instead how you could build a mouse.\nHow does the mouse build itself? The mouse’s genes switch one another on and\noff and perform computation, in steps. “I feel that this new molecular biology\nhas to go in this direction—to explore the high-level logical computers, the\nprograms, the algorithms of development.…\n\n“One would like to be able to fuse the two—to be able to move between the\nmolecular hardware and the _logical_ software of how it’s all organized,\nwithout feeling they are different sciences.”\n\nEven now—or especially now—the gene was not what it seemed. Having begun as a\nbotanist’s hunch and an algebraic convenience, it had been tracked down to the\nchromosome and revealed as molecular coiled strands. It was decoded,\nenumerated, and catalogued. And then, in the heyday of molecular biology, the\nidea of the gene broke free of its moorings once again.\n\nThe more was known, the harder it was to define. Is a gene nothing more or\nless than DNA? Is it _made_ of DNA, or is it something _carried_ in DNA? Is it\nproperly pinned down as a material thing at all?\n\nNot everyone agreed there was a problem. Gunther Stent declared in 1977 that\none of the field’s great triumphs was the “unambiguous identification” of the\nMendelian gene as a particular length of DNA. “It is in this sense that all\nworking geneticists now employ the term ‘gene,’\n”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1309787) he wrote. To put it technically but\nsuccinctly: “The gene is, in fact, a linear array of DNA nucleotides which\ndetermines a linear array of protein amino acids.” It was Seymour Benzer, said\nStent, who established that definitively.\n\nYet Benzer himself had not been quite so sanguine. He argued as early as 1957\nthat the classical gene was dead. It was a concept trying to serve three\npurposes at once—as a unit of recombination, of mutation, and of function—and\nalready he had strong reason to suspect that these were incompatible. A strand\nof DNA carries many base pairs, like beads on a string or letters in a\nsentence; as a physical object it could not be called an elementary unit.\nBenzer offered a batch of new particle names: “recon,” for the smallest unit\nthat can be interchanged by recombination; “muton,” for the smallest unit of\nmutational change (a single base pair); and “cistron” for the unit of\nfunction—which in turn, he admitted, was difficult to define. “It depends upon\nwhat level of function is meant,” he wrote—perhaps just the specification of\nan amino acid, or perhaps a whole ensemble of steps “leading to _one_\nparticular physiological end-effect.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1310209)\n_Gene_ was not going away, but that was a lot of weight for one little word to\nbear.\n\nPart of what was happening was a collision between molecular biology and\nevolutionary biology, as studied in fields from botany to paleontology. It was\nas fruitful a collision as any in the history of science—before long, neither\nside could move forward without the other—but on the way some sparks flared.\nQuite of few of them were set off by a young zoologist at Oxford, Richard\nDawkins. It seemed to Dawkins that many of his colleagues were looking at life\nthe wrong way round.\n\nAs molecular biology perfected its knowledge of the details of DNA and grew\nmore skillful in manipulating these molecular prodigies, it was natural to see\nthem as the answer to the great question of life: how do organisms reproduce\nthemselves? We use DNA, just as we use lungs to breathe and eyes to see. We\n_use_ it. “This attitude is an error of great\nprofundity,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1310578) Dawkins wrote. “It is the\ntruth turned crashingly on its head.” DNA came first—by billions of years—and\nDNA _comes_ first, he argued, when life is viewed from the proper perspective.\nFrom that perspective, genes are the focus, the sine qua non, the star of the\nshow. In his first book—published in 1976, meant for a broad audience,\nprovocatively titled _The Selfish Gene_ —he set off decades of debate by\ndeclaring: “We are survival machines—robot vehicles blindly programmed to\npreserve the selfish molecules known as\ngenes.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1310883) He said this was a truth he had\nknown for years.\n\nGenes, not organisms, are the true units of natural selection. They began as\n“replicators”—molecules formed accidentally in the primordial soup, with the\nunusual property of making copies of themselves.\n\n> > They are past masters of the survival arts. But do not look for them\n> floating loose in the sea; they gave up that cavalier freedom long ago.

Now they go\n> by the name of genes, and we are their survival\n> machines.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1311064)\n\nThis was guaranteed to raise the hackles of organisms who thought of\nthemselves as more than robots. “English biologist Richard Dawkins has\nrecently raised my hackles,” wrote Stephen Jay Gould in 1977, “with his claim\nthat genes themselves are units of selection, and individuals merely their\ntemporary receptacles.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1311262) Gould had\nplenty of company. Speaking for many molecular biologists, Gunther Stent\ndismissed Dawkins as “a thirty-six-year-old student of animal behavior” and\nfiled him under “the old prescientific tradition of animism, under which\nnatural objects are endowed with\nsouls.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1311595)\n\nYet Dawkins’s book was brilliant and transformative. It established a new,\nmultilayered understanding of the gene. At first, the idea of the selfish gene\nseemed like a trick of perspective, or a joke. Samuel Butler had said a\ncentury earlier—and did not claim to be the first—that a hen is only an egg’s\nway of making another egg. Butler was quite serious, in his way:\n\n> > Every creature must be allowed to “run” its own development in its own\n> way; the egg’s way may seem a very roundabout manner of doing things; but it\n> _is_ its way, and it is one of which man, upon the whole, has no great\n> reason to complain. Why the fowl should be considered more alive than the\n> egg, and why it should be said that the hen lays the egg, and not that the\n> egg lays the hen, these are questions which lie beyond the power of\n> philosophic explanation, but are perhaps most answerable by considering the\n> conceit of man, and his habit, persisted in during many ages, of ignoring\n> all that does not remind him of\n> himself.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1311920)\n\nHe added, “But, perhaps, after all, the real reason is, that the egg does not\ncackle when it has laid the hen.” Some time later, Butler’s template, _X is\njust a Y’s way of making another Y_ , began reappearing in many forms. “A\nscholar,” said Daniel Dennett in 1995, “is just a library’s way of making\nanother library.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1312222) Dennett, too, was not\nentirely joking.\n\nIt was prescient of Butler in 1878 to mock a man-centered view of life, but he\nhad read Darwin and could see that all creation had not been designed in\nbehalf of _Homo sapiens_. “Anthropocentrism is a disabling vice of the\nintellect,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1312571) Edward O. Wilson said a\ncentury later, but Dawkins was purveying an even more radical shift of\nperspective. He was not just nudging aside the human (and the hen) but the\norganism, in all its multifarious glory. How could biology _not_ be the study\nof organisms? If anything, he understated the difficulty when he wrote, “It\nrequires a deliberate mental effort to turn biology the right way up again,\nand remind ourselves that the replicators come first, in importance as well as\nin history.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1312883)\n\nA part of Dawkins’s purpose was to explain altruism: behavior in individuals\nthat goes against their own best interests. Nature is full of examples of\nanimals risking their own lives in behalf of their progeny, their cousins, or\njust fellow members of their genetic club. Furthermore, they share food; they\ncooperate in building hives and dams; they doggedly protect their eggs. To\nexplain such behavior—to explain any adaptation, for that matter—one asks the\nforensic detective’s question, _cui bono_? Who benefits when a bird spots a\npredator and cries out, warning the flock but also calling attention to\nitself? It is tempting to think in terms of the good of the group—the family,\ntribe, or species—but most theorists agree that evolution does not work that\nway. Natural selection can seldom operate at the level of groups. It turns\nout, however, that many explanations fall neatly into place if one thinks of\nthe individual as trying to propagate its particular assortment of genes down\nthrough the future. Its species shares most of those genes, of course, and its\nkin share even more. Of course, the individual does not know about its genes.\nIt is not consciously _trying_ to do any such thing. Nor, of course, would\nanyone impute intention to the gene itself—tiny brainless entity. But it works\nquite well, as Dawkins showed, to flip perspectives and say that the gene\nworks to maximize its own replication. For example, a gene “might ensure its\nsurvival by tending to endow the successive bodies with long legs, which help\nthose bodies escape from predators.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1313115) A\ngene might maximize its own numbers by giving an organism the instinctive\nimpulse to sacrifice its life to save its offspring: the gene itself, the\nparticular clump of DNA, dies with its creature, but copies of the gene live\non. The process is blind. It has no foresight, no intention, no knowledge. The\ngenes, too, are blind: “They do not plan\nahead,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1313316) says Dawkins. “Genes just _are_\n, some genes more so than others, and that is all there is to it.”\n\nThe history of life begins with the accidental appearance of molecules complex\nenough to serve as building blocks—replicators. The replicator is an\ninformation carrier. It survives and spreads by copying itself. The copies\nmust be coherent and reliable but need not be perfect; on the contrary, for\nevolution to proceed, errors must appear. Replicators could exist long before\nDNA, even before proteins. In one scenario, proposed by the Scots biologist\nAlexander Cairns-Smith, replicators appeared in sticky layers of clay\ncrystals: complex molecules of silicate minerals. In other models the\nevolutionary playground is the more traditional “primordial soup.” Either way,\nsome of these information-bearing macromolecules disintegrate more quickly\nthan others; some make more or better copies; some have the chemical effect of\nbreaking up competing molecules. Absorbing photon energy like the miniature\nMaxwell’s demons they are, molecules of ribonucleic acid, RNA, catalyze the\nformation of bigger and more information-rich molecules. DNA, ever so slightly\nmore stable, possesses the dual capability of copying itself while also\nmanufacturing another sort of molecule, and this provides a special advantage.\nIt can protect itself by building a shell of proteins around it. This is\nDawkins’s “survival machine”—first cells, then larger and larger bodies, with\ngrowing inventories of membranes and tissues and limbs and organs and skills.\nThey are the genes’ fancy vehicles, racing against other vehicles, converting\nenergy, and even processing information. In the game of survival some vehicles\noutplay, outmaneuver, and outpropagate others.\n\nIt took some time, but the gene-centered, information-based perspective led to\na new kind of detective work in tracing the history of life. Where\npaleontologists look back through the fossil record for skeletal precursors of\nwings and tails, molecular biologists and biophysicists look for telltale\nrelics of DNA in hemoglobin, oncogenes, and all the rest of the library of\nproteins and enzymes. “There is a molecular archeology in the\nmaking,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1313494) says Werner Loewenstein. The\nhistory of life is written in terms of negative entropy. “What actually\nevolves is information in all its forms or transforms. If there were something\nlike a guidebook for living creatures, I think, the first line would read like\na biblical commandment, _Make thy information larger_.”\n\nNo one gene makes an organism. Insects and plants and animals are collectives,\ncommunal vehicles, cooperative assemblies of a multitude of genes, each\nplaying its part in the organism’s development. It is a complex ensemble in\nwhich each gene interacts with thousands of others in a hierarchy of effects\nextending through both space and time. The body is a colony of genes. Of\ncourse, it acts and moves and procreates as a unit, and furthermore, in the\ncase of at least one species, it feels itself, with impressive certainty, to\nbe a unit. The gene-centered perspective has helped biologists appreciate that\nthe genes composing the human genome are only a fraction of the genes carried\naround in any one person, because humans (like other species) host an entire\necosystem of microbes—bacteria, especially, from our skin to our digestive\nsystems. Our “microbiomes” help us digest food and fight disease, all the\nwhile evolving fast and flexibly in service of their own interests. All these\ngenes engage in a grand process of mutual co-evolution—competing with one\nanother, and with their alternative alleles, in nature’s vast gene pool, but\nno longer competing on their own. Their success or failure comes through\ninteraction. “Selection favors those genes which succeed _in the presence of\nother genes_ ,” says Dawkins, “ _which in turn succeed in the presence of\nthem_.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1313868)\n\nThe effect of any one gene depends on these interactions with the ensemble and\ndepends, too, on effects of the environment and on raw chance. Indeed, just to\nspeak of a gene’s _effect_ became a complex business. It was not enough simply\nto say that the effect of a gene is the protein it synthesizes. One might want\nto say that a sheep or a crow has a gene for blackness. This might be a gene\nthat manufactures a protein for black pigment in wool or feathers. But sheep\nand crows and all the other creatures capable of blackness exhibit it in\nvarying circumstances and degrees; even so simple-seeming a quality seldom has\na biological on-off switch. Dawkins suggests the case of a gene that\nsynthesizes a protein that acts as an enzyme with many indirect and distant\neffects, one of which is to facilitate the synthesis of black\npigment.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1314160) Even more remotely, suppose a\ngene encourages an organism to seek sunlight, which is in turn necessary for\nthe black pigment. Such a gene serves as a mere co-conspirator but its role\nmay be indispensable. To call it a gene _for_ blackness, however, becomes\ndifficult. And it is harder still to specify genes for more complex\nqualities—genes for obesity or aggression or nest building or braininess or\nhomosexuality.\n\nAre there genes for such things? Not if a gene is a particular strand of DNA\nthat expresses a protein. Strictly speaking, one cannot say there are genes\n_for_ almost anything—not even eye color. Instead, one should say that\ndifferences in genes tend to cause differences in phenotype (the actualized\norganism). But from the earliest days of the study of heredity, scientists\nhave spoken of genes more broadly. If a population varies in some trait—say,\ntallness—and if the variation is subject to natural selection, then by\ndefinition it is at least partly genetic. There is a genetic component to the\nvariation in tallness. There is no gene for long legs; there is no gene for a\nleg at all.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1314346) To build a leg requires\nmany genes, each issuing instructions in the form of proteins, some making raw\nmaterials, some making timers and on-off switches. Some of these genes surely\nhave the effect of making legs longer than they would otherwise be, and it is\nthose genes that we may call, for short, genes _for_ long legs—as long as we\nremember that long-leggedness is not directly represented or encoded directly\nin the gene.\n\nSo geneticists and zoologists and ethologists and paleontologists all got into\nthe habit of saying “a gene for X” instead of “a genetic contribution to the\nvariation in X.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1314553) Dawkins was forcing\nthem to face the logical consequences. If there is any genetic variation in a\ntrait—eye color or obesity—then there must be a gene or genes for that trait.\nIt doesn’t matter that the actual appearance of the trait may depend on an\nunfathomable array of other factors, which may be environmental or even\naccidental. By way of illustration, he offered a deliberately extreme example:\na gene for reading.\n\nThe idea seems absurd, for several reasons. Reading is learned behavior. No\none is born able to read. If ever a skill depends on environmental factors,\nsuch as education, it is reading. Until a few millennia ago, the behavior did\nnot exist, so it could not have been subject to natural selection. You might\nas well say (as the geneticist John Maynard Smith did, mockingly) that there\nis a gene for tying shoelaces. But Dawkins was undaunted. He pointed out that\ngenes are about _differences_ , after all. So he began with a simple\ncounterpoint: might there not be a gene for dyslexia?\n\n> > All we would need in order to establish the existence of a gene for\n> reading is to discover a gene for not reading, say a gene which induced a\n> brain lesion causing specific dyslexia. Such a dyslexic person might be\n> normal and intelligent in all respects except that he could not read. No\n> geneticist would be particularly surprised if this type of dyslexia turned\n> out to breed true in some Mendelian fashion. Obviously, in this event the\n> gene would only exhibit its effect in an environment which included normal\n> education. In a prehistoric environment it might have had no detectable\n> effect, or it might have had some different effect and have been known to\n> cave-dwelling geneticists as, say, a gene for inability to read animal\n> footprints.…\n>\n\n>> It follows from the ordinary conventions of genetic terminology that the\nwild-type gene at the same locus, the gene that the rest of the population has\nin double dose, would properly be called a gene “for reading.” If you object\nto that, you must also object to our speaking of a gene for tallness in\nMendel’s peas.… In both cases the character of interest is a _difference_ ,\nand in both cases the difference only shows itself in some specified\nenvironment. The reason why something so simple as a one gene difference can\nhave such a complex effect … is basically as follows. However complex a given\nstate of the world may be, the _difference_ between that state of the world\nand some alternative state of the world may be caused by something extremely\nsimple.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1314780)\n\nCan there be a gene for altruism? Yes, says Dawkins, if this means “any gene\nthat influences the development of nervous systems in such a way as to make\nthem likely to behave altruistically.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1314962)\nSuch genes—these replicators, these survivors—know nothing about altruism and\nnothing about reading, of course. Whatever and wherever they are, their\nphenotypic effects matter only insofar as they help the genes propagate.\n\nMolecular biology, in its signal achievement, had pinpointed the gene in a\nprotein-encoding piece of DNA. This was the hardware definition. The software\ndefinition was older and fuzzier: the unit of heredity; the bearer of a\nphenotypic difference. With the two definitions uneasily coexisting, Dawkins\nlooked past them both.\n\nIf genes are meant to be masters of survival, they can hardly be fragments of\nnucleic acid. Such things are fleeting. To say that a replicator manages to\nsurvive for eons is to define the replicator as _all the copies considered as\none_. Thus the gene does not “grow senile,” Dawkins declared.\n\n> > It is no more likely to die when it is a million years old than when it is\n> only a hundred.

(Unless you already believed in the\nimmortal soul.) The gene is not an information-carrying macromolecule. The\ngene is the information. The physicist Max Delbrück wrote in 1949, “Today the\ntendency is to say ‘genes are just molecules, or hereditary particles,’ and\nthus to do away with the abstractions.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1315397)\nNow the abstractions returned.\n\nWhere, then, is any particular gene—say, the gene for long legs in humans?\nThis is a little like asking where is Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in E minor. Is\nit in the original handwritten score? The printed sheet music? Any one\nperformance—or perhaps the sum of all performances, historical and potential,\nreal and imagined?\n\nThe quavers and crotchets inked on paper are not the music. Music is not a\nseries of pressure waves sounding through the air; nor grooves etched in vinyl\nor pits burned in CDs; nor even the neuronal symphonies stirred up in the\nbrain of the listener. The music is the information. Likewise, the base pairs\nof DNA are not genes. They encode genes. Genes themselves are made of bits.\n\n* * *\n\n* He added: “Old terms are mostly compromised by their application in antiquated or erroneous theories and systems, from which they carry splinters of inadequate ideas, not always harmless to the developing insight.”\n\n* In listing twenty amino acids, Gamow was getting ahead of what was actually known. The number twenty turned out to be correct, though Gamow’s list was not.\n\n\n# 11 | INTO THE MEME POOL\n\n\n##\n\n> (You Parasitize My Brain)\n\n> _When I muse about memes, I often find myself picturing an ephemeral\n> flickering pattern of sparks leaping from brain to brain, screaming “Me,\n> me!”_\n\n> —Douglas Hofstadter (1983)[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1315827)\n\n“NOW THROUGH THE VERY UNIVERSALITY of its structures, starting with the code,\nthe biosphere looks like the product of a unique\nevent,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1316197) Jacques Monod wrote in 1970.\n“The universe was not pregnant with life, nor the biosphere with man. Our\nnumber came up in the Monte Carlo game. Is it any wonder if, like a person who\nhas just made a million at the casino, we feel a little strange and a little\nunreal?”\n\nMonod, the Parisian biologist who shared the Nobel Prize for working out the\nrole of messenger RNA in the transfer of genetic information, was not alone in\nthinking of the biosphere as more than a notional place: an entity, composed\nof all the earth’s life-forms, simple and complex, teeming with information,\nreplicating and evolving, coding from one level of abstraction to the next.\nThis view of life was more abstract—more mathematical—than anything Darwin had\nimagined, but he would have recognized its basic principles. Natural selection\ndirects the whole show. Now biologists, having absorbed the methods and\nvocabulary of communications science, went further to make their own\ncontributions to the understanding of information itself. Monod proposed an\nanalogy: Just as the biosphere stands above the world of nonliving matter, so\nan “abstract kingdom” rises above the biosphere. The denizens of this kingdom?\nIdeas.\n\n> > Ideas have retained some of the properties of organisms.

An example of an infectious idea might be a religious ideology\nthat gains sway over a large group of people. The American neurophysiologist\nRoger Sperry had put forward a similar notion several years earlier, arguing\nthat ideas are “just as real” as the neurons they inhabit. Ideas have power,\nhe said.\n\n> > Ideas cause ideas and help evolve new ideas. They interact with each other\n> and with other mental forces in the same brain, in neighboring brains, and\n> thanks to global communication, in far distant, foreign brains. And they\n> also interact with the external surroundings to produce in toto a burstwise\n> advance in evolution that is far beyond anything to hit the evolutionary\n> scene yet.…[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1316745)\n\nMonod added, “I shall not hazard a theory of the selection of ideas.” No need.\nOthers were willing.\n\nRichard Dawkins made his own connection between the evolution of genes and the\nevolution of ideas. His essential actor was the replicator, and it scarcely\nmattered whether replicators were made of nucleic acid. His rule is “All life\nevolves by the differential survival of replicating entities.” Wherever there\nis life, there must be replicators. Perhaps on other worlds replicators could\narise in a silicon-based chemistry—or in no chemistry at all.\n\nWhat would it mean for a replicator to exist without chemistry? “I think that\na new kind of replicator has recently emerged on this\nplanet,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1317082) he proclaimed at the end of\nhis first book, in 1976. “It is staring us in the face. It is still in its\ninfancy, still drifting clumsily about in its primeval soup, but already it is\nachieving evolutionary change at a rate that leaves the old gene panting far\nbehind.” That “soup” is human culture; the vector of transmission is language;\nand the spawning ground is the brain.\n\nFor this bodiless replicator itself, Dawkins proposed a name. He called it the\n_meme_ , and it became his most memorable invention, far more influential than\nhis selfish genes or his later proselytizing against religiosity. “Memes\npropagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a\nprocess which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation,” he wrote. They\ncompete with one another for limited resources: brain time or bandwidth. They\ncompete most of all for _attention_. For example:\n\n_Ideas_. Whether an idea arises uniquely or reappears many times, it may\nthrive in the meme pool or it may dwindle and vanish. The belief in God is an\nexample Dawkins offers—an ancient idea, replicating itself not just in words\nbut in music and art. The belief that the earth orbits the sun is no less a\nmeme, competing with others for survival. (Truth may be a helpful quality for\na meme, but it is only one among many.)\n\n_Tunes_. This tune\n\n![](images/00055.jpg)\n\nhas spread for centuries across several continents. This one\n\n![](images/00056.jpg)\n\na notorious though shorter-lived invader of brains, overran an immense\npopulation many times faster.\n\n_Catchphrases_. One text snippet, “What hath God wrought?” appeared early and\nspread rapidly in more than one medium. Another, “Read my lips,” charted a\npeculiar path through late twentieth-century America. “Survival of the\nfittest” is a meme that, like other memes, mutates wildly (“survival of the\nfattest”; “survival of the sickest”; “survival of the fakest”; “survival of\nthe twittest”;…).\n\n_Images_. In Isaac Newton’s lifetime, no more than a few thousand people had\nany idea what he looked like, though he was one of England’s most famous men,\nyet now millions of people have quite a clear idea—based on replicas of copies\nof rather poorly painted portraits. Even more pervasive and indelible are the\nsmile of _Mona Lisa_ , _The Scream_ of Edvard Munch, and the silhouettes of\nvarious fictional extraterrestrials. These are memes, living a life of their\nown, independent of any physical reality. “This may not be what George\nWashington looked like then,” a tour guide was overheard saying of the Gilbert\nStuart painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, “but this is what he looks\nlike now.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1317364) Exactly.\n\nMemes emerge in brains and travel outward, establishing beachheads on paper\nand celluloid and silicon and anywhere else information can go. They are not\nto be thought of as elementary particles but as organisms. The number three is\nnot a meme; nor is the color blue, nor any simple thought, any more than a\nsingle nucleotide can be a gene. Memes are complex units, distinct and\nmemorable—units with staying power. Also, an object is not a meme. The hula\nhoop is not a meme; it is made of plastic, not of bits. When this species of\ntoy spread worldwide in a mad epidemic in 1958, it was the product, the\nphysical manifestation of a meme, or memes: the craving for hula hoops; the\nswaying, swinging, twirling skill set of hula-hooping. The hula hoop itself is\na meme vehicle. So, for that matter, is each human hula hooper—a strikingly\neffective meme vehicle, in the sense neatly explained by the philosopher\nDaniel Dennett: “A wagon with spoked wheels carries not only grain or freight\nfrom place to place; it carries the brilliant idea of a wagon with spoked\nwheels from mind to mind.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1317704) Hula hoopers\ndid that for the hula hoop’s memes—and in 1958 they found a new transmission\nvector, broadcast television, sending its messages immeasurably faster and\nfarther than any wagon. The moving image of the hula hooper seduced new minds\nby hundreds, and then by thousands, and then by millions. The meme is not the\ndancer but the dance.\n\nWe are their vehicles and their enablers. For most of our biological history\nthey existed fleetingly; their main mode of transmission was the one called\n“word of mouth.” Lately, however, they have managed to adhere in solid\nsubstance: clay tablets, cave walls, paper sheets. They achieve longevity\nthrough our pens and printing presses, magnetic tapes and optical disks. They\nspread via broadcast towers and digital networks. Memes may be stories,\nrecipes, skills, legends, and fashions. We copy them, one person at a time.\nAlternatively, in Dawkins’s meme-centered perspective, they copy themselves.\nAt first some of Dawkins’s readers wondered how literally to take that. Did he\nmean to give memes anthropomorphic desires, intentions, and goals? It was the\nselfish gene all over again. (Typical salvo: “Genes cannot be selfish or\nunselfish, any more than atoms can be jealous, elephants abstract or biscuits\nteleological.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1317962) Typical rebuttal: a\nreminder that _selfishness_ is defined by the geneticist as the tendency to\nincrease one’s chances of survival relative to its competitors.)\n\nDawkins’s way of speaking was not meant to suggest that memes are conscious\nactors, only that they are entities with interests that can be furthered by\nnatural selection. Their interests are not our interests. “A meme,” Dennett\nsays, “is an information packet with\nattitude.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1318213) When we speak of _fighting\nfor a principle_ or _dying for an idea_ , we may be more literal than we know.\n“To die for an idea; it is unquestionably\nnoble,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1318684) H. L. Mencken wrote. “But how\nmuch nobler it would be if men died for ideas that were true!”\n\n_Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor_ … Rhyme and rhythm help people remember bits\nof text. Or: rhyme and rhythm help bits of text get remembered. Rhyme and\nrhythm are qualities that aid a meme’s survival, just as strength and speed\naid an animal’s. Patterned language has an evolutionary advantage. Rhyme,\nrhythm, and reason—for reason, too, is a form of pattern. _I was promised on a\ntime to have reason for my rhyme; from that time unto this season, I received\nnor rhyme nor reason_.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1318974)\n\nLike genes, memes have effects on the wide world beyond themselves: phenotypic\neffects. In some cases (the meme for making fire; for wearing clothes; for the\nresurrection of Jesus) the effects can be powerful indeed. As they broadcast\ntheir influence on the world, memes thus influence the conditions affecting\ntheir own chances of survival. The meme or memes composing Morse code had\nstrong positive feedback effects. “I believe that, given the right conditions,\nreplicators automatically band together to create systems, or machines, that\ncarry them around and work to favour their continued\nreplication,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1319269) wrote Dawkins. Some memes\nhave evident benefits for their human hosts (“look before you leap,” knowledge\nof CPR, belief in hand washing before cooking), but memetic success and\ngenetic success are not the same. Memes can replicate with impressive\nvirulence while leaving swaths of collateral damage—patent medicines and\npsychic surgery, astrology and satanism, racist myths, superstitions, and (a\nspecial case) computer viruses. In a way, these are the most interesting—the\nmemes that thrive to their hosts’ detriment, such as the idea that suicide\nbombers will find their reward in heaven.\n\nWhen Dawkins first floated the _meme_ meme, Nicholas Humphrey, an evolutionary\npsychologist, said immediately that these entities should be considered\n“living structures, not just metaphorically but technically”:\n\n> > When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my\n> brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme’s propagation in just the way\n> that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell. And this\n> isn’t just a way of talking—the meme for, say, “belief in life after death”\n> is actually realized physically, millions of times over, as a structure in\n> the nervous systems of individual men the world\n> over.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1319505)\n\nMost early readers of _The Selfish Gene_ passed over memes as a fanciful\nafterthought, but the pioneering ethologist W. D. Hamilton, reviewing the book\nfor _Science_ , ventured this prediction:\n\n> > Hard as this term may be to delimit—it surely must be harder than gene,\n> which is bad enough—I suspect that it will soon be in common use by\n> biologists and, one hopes, by philosophers, linguists, and others as well\n> and that it may become absorbed as far as the word “gene” has been into\n> everyday speech.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1319710)\n\nMemes could travel wordlessly even before language was born. Plain mimicry is\nenough to replicate knowledge—how to chip an arrowhead or start a fire. Among\nanimals, chimpanzees and gorillas are known to acquire behaviors by imitation.\nSome species of songbirds _learn_ their songs, or at least song variants,\nafter hearing them from neighboring birds (or, more recently, from\nornithologists with audio players). Birds develop song repertoires and song\ndialects—in short, they exhibit a birdsong _culture_ that predates human\nculture by eons.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1319983) These special cases\nnotwithstanding, for most of human history memes and language have gone hand\nin glove. (Clichés are memes.) Language serves as culture’s first catalyst. It\nsupersedes mere imitation, spreading knowledge by abstraction and encoding.\n\nPerhaps the analogy with disease was inevitable. Before anyone understood\nanything of epidemiology, its language was applied to species of information.\nAn emotion can be _infectious_ , a tune _catchy_ , a habit _contagious_. “From\nlook to look, contagious through the crowd / The panic\nruns,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1320355) wrote the poet James Thomson in\n1730. Lust, likewise, according to Milton: “Eve, whose eye darted contagious\nfire.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1320563) But only in the new millennium,\nin the time of global electronic transmission, has the identification become\nsecond nature. Ours is the age of virality: viral education, viral marketing,\nviral e-mail and video and networking. Researchers studying the Internet\nitself as a medium—crowdsourcing, collective attention, social networking, and\nresource allocation—employ not only the language but also the mathematical\nprinciples of epidemiology.\n\nOne of the first to use the terms _viral text_ and _viral sentences_ seems to\nhave been a reader of Dawkins named Stephen Walton of New York City,\ncorresponding in 1981 with Douglas Hofstadter. Thinking logically—perhaps in\nthe mode of a computer—Walton proposed simple self-replicating sentences along\nthe lines of “Say me!” “Copy me!” and “If you copy me, I’ll grant you three\nwishes!”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1320768) Hofstadter, then a columnist\nfor _Scientific American_ , found the term _viral text_ itself to be even\ncatchier.\n\n> > Well, now, Walton’s own viral text, as you can see here before your eyes,\n> has managed to commandeer the facilities of a very powerful host—an entire\n> magazine and printing press and distribution service. It has leapt aboard\n> and is now—even as you read this viral sentence—propagating itself madly\n> throughout the ideosphere!\n\n(In the early 1980s, a magazine with a print circulation of 700,000 still\nseemed like a powerful communications platform.) Hofstadter gaily declared\nhimself infected by the _meme_ meme.\n\nOne source of resistance—or at least unease—was the shoving of us humans\ntoward the wings. It was bad enough to say that a person is merely a gene’s\nway of making more genes. Now humans are to be considered as vehicles for the\npropagation of memes, too. No one likes to be called a puppet. Dennett summed\nup the problem this way: “I don’t know about you, but I am not initially\nattracted by the idea of my brain as a sort of dung heap in which the larvae\nof other people’s ideas renew themselves, before sending out copies of\nthemselves in an informational diaspora.… Who’s in charge, according to this\nvision—we or our memes?”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1321041)\n\nHe answered his own question by reminding us that, like it or not, we are\nseldom “in charge” of our own minds. He might have quoted Freud; instead he\nquoted Mozart (or so he thought):\n\n> > In the night when I cannot sleep, thoughts crowd into my mind.… Whence and\n> how do they come? I do not know and I have nothing to do with it. Those\n> which please me I keep in my head and hum them.\n\nLater Dennett was informed that this well-known quotation was not Mozart’s\nafter all. It had taken on a life of its own; it was a fairly successful meme.\n\nFor anyone taken with the idea of memes, the landscape was changing faster\nthan Dawkins had imagined possible in 1976, when he wrote, “The computers in\nwhich memes live are human brains.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1321280) By\n1989, the time of the second edition of _The Selfish Gene_ , having become an\nadept programmer himself, he had to amend that: “It was obviously predictable\nthat manufactured electronic computers, too, would eventually play host to\nself-replicating patterns of\ninformation.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1321507) Information was passing\nfrom one computer to another “when their owners pass floppy discs around,” and\nhe could see another phenomenon on the near horizon: computers connected in\nnetworks. “Many of them,” he wrote, “are literally wired up together in\nelectronic mail exchange.… It is a perfect milieu for self-replicating\nprograms to flourish.” Indeed, the Internet was in its birth throes. Not only\ndid it provide memes with a nutrient-rich culture medium; it also gave wings\nto the _idea_ of memes. _Meme_ itself quickly became an Internet buzzword.\nAwareness of memes fostered their spread.\n\nA notorious example of a meme that could not have emerged in pre-Internet\nculture was the phrase “jumped the shark.” Loopy self-reference characterized\nevery phase of its existence. To jump the shark means to pass a peak of\nquality or popularity and begin an irreversible decline. The phrase was\nthought to have been used first in 1985 by a college student named Sean J.\nConnolly, in reference to a certain television series. The origin of the\nphrase requires a certain amount of explanation without which it could not\nhave been initially understood. Perhaps for that reason, there is no recorded\nusage until 1997, when Connolly’s roommate, Jon Hein, registered the domain\nname _jumptheshark.com_ and created a web site devoted to its promotion. The\nweb site soon featured a list of frequently asked questions:\n\n> > Q. Did “jump the shark” originate from this web site, or did you create\n> the site to capitalize on the phrase?\n>\n\n>> A. This site went up December 24, 1997 and gave birth to the phrase “jump\nthe shark.” As the site continues to grow in popularity, the term has become\nmore commonplace. The site is the chicken, the egg, and now a Catch-22.\n\nIt spread to more traditional media in the next year; Maureen Dowd devoted a\ncolumn to explaining it in _The New York Times_ in 2001; in 2003 the same\nnewspaper’s “On Language” columnist, William Safire, called it “the popular\nculture’s phrase of the year”; soon after that, people were using the phrase\nin speech and in print without self-consciousness—no quotation marks or\nexplanation—and eventually, inevitably, various cultural observers asked, “Has\n‘jump the shark’ jumped the shark?” (“Granted, Jump the Shark is a brilliant\ncultural concept.… But now the damn thing is everywhere.”) Like any good meme,\nit spawned mutations. The “jumping the shark” entry in Wikipedia advised in\n2009, “See also: jumping the couch; nuking the fridge.”\n\nIs this science? In his 1983 column, Hofstadter proposed the obvious memetic\nlabel for such a discipline: _memetics_. The study of memes has attracted\nresearchers from fields as far apart as computer science and microbiology. In\nbioinformatics, chain letters are an object of study. They are memes; they\nhave evolutionary histories. The very purpose of a chain letter is\nreplication; whatever else a chain letter may say, it embodies one message:\n_Copy me_. One student of chain-letter evolution, Daniel W. VanArsdale, listed\nmany variants, in chain letters and even earlier texts: “Make seven copies of\nit exactly as it is written” [1902]; “Copy this in full and send to nine\nfriends” [1923]; “And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of\nthis prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life”\n[Revelation 22:19].[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1321692) Chain letters\nflourished with the help of a new nineteenth-century technology: “carbonic\npaper,” sandwiched between sheets of writing paper in stacks. Then carbon\npaper made a symbiotic partnership with another technology, the typewriter.\nViral outbreaks of chain letters occurred all through the early twentieth\ncentury.\n\n“An unusual chain-letter reached Quincy during the latter part of\n1933,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1322103) wrote a local Illinois\nhistorian. “So rapidly did the chain-letter fad develop symptoms of mass\nhysteria and spread throughout the United States, that by 1935–1936 the Post\nOffice Department, as well as agencies of public opinion, had to take a hand\nin suppressing the movement.” He provided a sample—a meme motivating its human\ncarriers with promises and threats:\n\n> > We trust in God. He supplies our needs.\n>\n\n>> Mrs. F. Streuzel........Mich.\n\n>\n\n>> Mrs. A. Ford............Chicago, Ill.\n\n>\n\n>> Mrs. K. Adkins..........Chicago, Ill.\n\n>\n\n>> etc.\n\n>\n\n>> Copy the above names, omitting the first. Add your name last. Mail it to\nfive persons who you wish prosperity to. The chain was started by an American\nColonel and must be mailed 24 hours after receiving it. This will bring\nprosperity within 9 days after mailing it.\n\n>\n\n>> Mrs. Sanford won $3,000. Mrs. Andres won $1,000.\n\n>\n\n>> Mrs. Howe who broke the chain lost everything she possessed.\n\n>\n\n>> The chain grows a definite power over the expected word.\n\n>\n\n>> DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN.\n\nTwo subsequent technologies, when their use became widespread, provided\norders-of-magnitude boosts in chain-letter fecundity: photocopying (c. 1950)\nand e-mail (c. 1995). One team of information scientists—Charles H. Bennett\nfrom IBM in New York and Ming Li and Bin Ma from Ontario, Canada—inspired by a\nchance conversation on a hike in the Hong Kong mountains, began an analysis of\na set of chain letters collected during the photocopier era. They had thirty-\nthree, all variants of a single letter, with mutations in the form of\nmisspellings, omissions, and transposed words and phrases. “These letters have\npassed from host to host, mutating and\nevolving,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1322430) they reported.\n\n> > Like a gene, their average length is about 2,000 characters. Like a potent\n> virus, the letter threatens to kill you and induces you to pass it on to\n> your “friends and associates”—some variation of this letter has probably\n> reached millions of people. Like an inheritable trait, it promises benefits\n> for you and the people you pass it on to. Like genomes, chain letters\n> undergo natural selection and sometimes parts even get transferred between\n> coexisting “species.”\n\nReaching beyond these appealing metaphors, they set out to use the letters as\na “test bed” for algorithms used in evolutionary biology. The algorithms were\ndesigned to take the genomes of various modern creatures and work backward, by\ninference and deduction, to reconstruct their phylogeny—their evolutionary\ntrees. If these mathematical methods worked with genes, the scientists\nsuggested, they should work with chain letters, too. In both cases the\nresearchers were able to verify mutation rates and relatedness measures.\n\nStill, most of the elements of culture change and blur too easily to qualify\nas stable replicators. They are rarely as neatly fixed as a sequence of DNA.\nDawkins himself emphasized that he had never imagined founding anything like a\nnew science of memetics. A peer-reviewed _Journal of Memetics_ came to life in\n1997—published online, naturally—and then faded away after eight years partly\nspent in self-conscious debate over status, mission, and terminology. Even\ncompared with genes, memes are hard to mathematize or even to define\nrigorously. So the gene-meme analogy causes uneasiness and the genetics-\nmemetics analogy even more.\n\nGenes at least have a grounding in physical substance. Memes are abstract,\nintangible, and unmeasurable. Genes replicate with near-perfect fidelity, and\nevolution depends on that: some variation is essential, but mutations need to\nbe rare. Memes are seldom copied exactly; their boundaries are always fuzzy,\nand they mutate with a wild flexibility that would be fatal in biology. The\nterm _meme_ could be applied to a suspicious cornucopia of entities, from\nsmall to large. For Dennett, the first four notes of Beethoven’s Fifth\nSymphony were “clearly” a meme, along with Homer’s _Odyssey_ (or at least the\n_idea_ of the _Odyssey_), the wheel, anti-Semitism, and\nwriting.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1322774) “Memes have not yet found\ntheir Watson and Crick,” said Dawkins; “they even lack their\nMendel.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1323001)\n\nYet here they are. As the arc of information flow bends toward ever greater\nconnectivity, memes evolve faster and spread farther. Their presence is felt\nif not seen in herd behavior, bank runs, informational cascades, and financial\nbubbles. Diets rise and fall in popularity, their very names becoming\ncatchphrases—the South Beach Diet and the Atkins Diet, the Scarsdale Diet, the\nCookie Diet and the Drinking Man’s Diet all replicating according to a dynamic\nabout which the science of nutrition has nothing to say. Medical practice,\ntoo, experiences “surgical fads” and “iatroepidemics”—epidemics caused by\nfashions in treatment—like the iatroepidemic of children’s tonsillectomies\nthat swept the United States and parts of Europe in the mid-twentieth century,\nwith no more medical benefit than ritual circumcision. Memes were seen through\ncar windows when yellow diamond-shaped BABY ON BOARD signs appeared as if in\nan instant of mass panic in 1984, in the United States and then Europe and\nJapan, followed an instant later by a spawn of ironic mutations (BABY I’M\nBOARD, EX IN TRUNK). Memes were felt when global discourse was dominated in\nthe last year of the millennium by the belief that the world’s computers would\nstammer or choke when their internal clocks reached a special round number.\n\nIn the competition for space in our brains and in the culture, the effective\ncombatants are the messages. The new, oblique, looping views of genes and\nmemes have enriched us. They give us paradoxes to write on Möbius strips. “The\nhuman world is made of stories, not\npeople,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1323288) writes David Mitchell. “The\npeople the stories use to tell themselves are not to be blamed.” Margaret\nAtwood writes: “As with all knowledge, once you knew it, you couldn’t imagine\nhow it was that you hadn’t known it before. Like stage magic, knowledge before\nyou knew it took place before your very eyes, but you were looking\nelsewhere.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1323542) Nearing death, John Updike\nreflects on\n\n> A life poured into words—apparent waste\n>\n> intended to preserve the thing\n> consumed.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1323808)\n\nFred Dretske, a philosopher of mind and knowledge, wrote in 1981: “In the\nbeginning there was information. The word came\nlater.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1324108) He added this explanation: “The\ntransition was achieved by the development of organisms with the capacity for\nselectively exploiting this information in order to survive and perpetuate\ntheir kind.” Now we might add, thanks to Dawkins, that the transition was\nachieved by the information itself, surviving and perpetuating its kind and\nselectively exploiting organisms.\n\nMost of the biosphere cannot see the infosphere; it is invisible, a parallel\nuniverse humming with ghostly inhabitants. But they are not ghosts to us—not\nanymore. We humans, alone among the earth’s organic creatures, live in both\nworlds at once. It is as though, having long coexisted with the unseen, we\nhave begun to develop the needed extrasensory perception. We are aware of the\nmany species of information. We name their types sardonically, as though to\nreassure ourselves that we understand: _urban myths_ and _zombie lies_. We\nkeep them alive in air-conditioned server farms. But we cannot own them. When\na jingle lingers in our ears, or a fad turns fashion upside down, or a hoax\ndominates the global chatter for months and vanishes as swiftly as it came,\nwho is master and who is slave?\n\n\n# 12 | THE SENSE OF RANDOMNESS\n\n\n##\n\n> (In a State of Sin)\n\n> _“I wonder,” she said. “It’s getting harder to see the patterns, don’t you\n> think?”_\n\n> —Michael Cunningham (2005)[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1324508)\n\nIN 1958, GREGORY CHAITIN, a precocious eleven-year-old New Yorker, the son of\nArgentine émigrés, found a magical little book in the library and carried it\naround with him for a while trying to explain it to other children—and then,\nhe had to admit, trying to understand it\nhimself.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1324758) It was _Gödel’s Proof_ , by\nErnest Nagel and James R. Newman. Expanded from an article in _Scientific\nAmerican_ , it reviewed the renaissance in logic that began with George Boole;\nthe process of “mapping,” encoding statements about mathematics in the form of\nsymbols and even integers; and the idea of metamathematics, systematized\nlanguage _about_ mathematics and therefore _beyond_ mathematics. This was\nheady stuff for the boy, who followed the authors through their simplified but\nrigorous exposition of Gödel’s “astounding and melancholy” demonstration that\nformal mathematics can never be free of self-\ncontradiction.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1325100)\n\nThe vast bulk of mathematics as practiced at this time cared not at all for\nGödel’s proof. Startling though incompleteness surely was, it seemed\nincidental somehow—contributing nothing to the useful work of mathematicians,\nwho went on making discoveries and proving theorems. But philosophically\nminded souls remained deeply disturbed by it, and these were the sorts of\npeople Chaitin liked to read. One was John von Neumann—who had been there at\nthe start, in Königsberg, 1930, and then in the United States took the central\nrole in the development of computation and computing theory. For von Neumann,\nGödel’s proof was a point of no return:\n\n> > It was a very serious conceptual crisis, dealing with rigor and the proper\n> way to carry out a correct mathematical proof. In view of the earlier\n> notions of the absolute rigor of mathematics, it is surprising that such a\n> thing could have happened, and even more surprising that it could have\n> happened in these latter days when miracles are not supposed to take place.\n> Yet it did happen.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1325386)\n\n_Why_? Chaitin asked. He wondered if at some level Gödel’s incompleteness\ncould be connected to that new principle of quantum physics, uncertainty,\nwhich smelled similar somehow.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1325737) Later,\nthe adult Chaitin had a chance to put this question to the oracular John\nArchibald Wheeler. Was Gödel incompleteness related to Heisenberg uncertainty?\nWheeler answered by saying he had once posed that very question to Gödel\nhimself, in his office at the Institute for Advanced Study—Gödel with his legs\nwrapped in a blanket, an electric heater glowing warm against the wintry\ndrafts. Gödel refused to answer. In this way, Wheeler refused to answer\nChaitin.\n\nWhen Chaitin came upon Turing’s proof of uncomputability, he thought this must\nbe the key. He also found Shannon and Weaver’s book, _The Mathematical Theory\nof Communication_ , and was struck by its upside-down seeming reformulation of\nentropy: an entropy of bits, measuring information on the one hand and\ndisorder on the other. The common element was randomness, Chaitin suddenly\nthought. Shannon linked randomness, perversely, to information. Physicists had\nfound randomness inside the atom—the kind of randomness that Einstein deplored\nby complaining about God and dice. All these heroes of science were talking\nabout or around randomness.\n\nIt is a simple word, _random_ , and everyone knows what it means. Everyone,\nthat is, and no one. Philosophers and mathematicians struggled endlessly.\nWheeler said this much, at least: “Probability, like time, is a concept\ninvented by humans, and humans have to bear the responsibility for the\nobscurities that attend it.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1326038) The toss\nof a fair coin is random, though every detail of the coin’s trajectory may be\ndetermined à la Newton. Whether the population of France is an even or odd\nnumber at any given instant is random, but the population of France itself is\nsurely _not_ random: it is a definite fact, even if not\nknowable.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1326350) John Maynard Keynes tackled\nrandomness in terms of its opposites, and he chose three: knowledge,\ncausality, and design.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1326602) What is known in\nadvance, determined by a cause, or organized according to plan cannot be\nrandom.\n\n“Chance is only the measure of our\nignorance,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1326825) Henri Poincaré famously\nsaid. “Fortuitous phenomena are by definition those whose laws we do not\nknow.” Immediately he recanted: “Is this definition very satisfactory? When\nthe first Chaldean shepherds watched the movements of the stars, they did not\nyet know the laws of astronomy, but would they have dreamed of saying that the\nstars move at random?” For Poincaré, who understood chaos long before it\nbecame a science, examples of randomness included such phenomena as the\nscattering of raindrops, their causes physically determined but so numerous\nand complex as to be unpredictable. In physics—or wherever natural processes\nseem unpredictable—apparent randomness may be noise or may arise from deeply\ncomplex dynamics.\n\nIgnorance is subjective. It is a quality of the observer. Presumably\nrandomness—if it exists at all—should be a quality of the thing itself.\nLeaving humans out of the picture, one would like to say that an event, a\nchoice, a distribution, a game, or, most simply, a number is random.\n\nThe notion of a random number is full of difficulties. Can there be such thing\nas a _particular_ random number; a _certain_ random number? This number is\narguably random:\n\n> >\n> 10![](images/00057.jpg)097![](images/00057.jpg)325![](images/00057.jpg)337![](images/00057.jpg)652![](images/00057.jpg)013![](images/00057.jpg)586![](images/00057.jpg)346![](images/00057.jpg)735![](images/00057.jpg)487![](images/00057.jpg)680![](images/00057.jpg)959![](images/00057.jpg)091![](images/00057.jpg)173![](images/00057.jpg)929![](images/00057.jpg)274![](images/00057.jpg)945…[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1327130)\n\nThen again, it is special. It begins a book published in 1955 with the title\n_A Million Random Digits_. The RAND Corporation generated the digits by means\nof what it described as an electronic roulette wheel: a pulse generator,\nemitting 100,000 pulses per second, gated through a five-place binary counter,\nthen passed through a binary-to-decimal converter, fed into an IBM punch, and\nprinted by an IBM model 856 Cardatype.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1327384)\nThe process took years. When the first batch of digits was tested,\nstatisticians discovered significant biases: digits, or groups of digits, or\npatterns of digits that appeared too frequently or not frequently enough.\nFinally, however, the tables were published. “Because of the very nature of\nthe tables,” the editors said wryly, “it did not seem necessary to proofread\nevery page of the final manuscript in order to catch random errors of the\nCardatype.”\n\nThe book had a market because scientists had a working need for random numbers\nin bulk, to use in designing statistically fair experiments and building\nrealistic models of complex systems. The new method of Monte Carlo simulation\nemployed random sampling to model phenomena that could not be solved\nanalytically; Monte Carlo simulation was invented and named by von Neumann’s\nteam at the atomic-bomb project, desperately trying to generate random numbers\nto help them calculate neutron diffusion. Von Neumann realized that a\nmechanical computer, with its deterministic algorithms and finite storage\ncapacity, could never generate truly random numbers. He would have to settle\nfor _pseudorandom_ numbers: deterministically generated numbers that behaved\nas if random. They were random enough for practical purposes. “Any one who\nconsiders arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a\nstate of sin,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1327561) said von Neumann.\n\nRandomness might be defined in terms of order—its absence, that is. This\norderly little number sequence can hardly be called “random”:\n\n> > 00000\n\nYet it makes a cameo appearance in the middle of the famous million random\ndigits. In terms of probability, that is to be expected: “00000” is as likely\nto occur as any of the other 99,999 possible five-digit strings. Elsewhere in\nthe million random digits we find:\n\n> > 010101\n\nThis, too, appears patterned.\n\nTo pick out fragments of pattern in this jungle of digits requires work by an\nintelligent observer. Given a long enough random string, every possible short-\nenough substring will appear somewhere. One of them will be the combination to\nthe bank vault. Another will be the encoded complete works of Shakespeare. But\nthey will not do any good, because no one can find them.\n\nPerhaps we may say that numbers like 00000 and 010101 can be random in a\nparticular context. If a person flips a fair coin (one of the simplest\nmechanical random-number generators) long enough, at some point the coin is\nbound to come up heads ten times in a row. When that happens, the random-\nnumber seeker will typically discard the result and go for a coffee break.\nThis is one of the ways humans do poorly at generating random numbers, even\nwith mechanical assistance. Researchers have established that human intuition\nis useless both in predicting randomness and in recognizing it. Humans drift\ntoward pattern willy-nilly. The New York Public Library bought _A Million\nRandom Digits_ and shelved it under Psychology. In 2010 it was still available\nfrom Amazon for eighty-one dollars.\n\nA number is (we now understand) information. When we modern people, Shannon’s\nheirs, think about information in its purest form, we may imagine a string of\n0s and 1s, a binary number. Here are two binary strings, fifty digits long:\n\n> A:\n> 01010![](images/00057.jpg)1010![](images/00057.jpg)10101![](images/00057.jpg)01010![](images/00057.jpg)10101![](images/00057.jpg)01010![](images/00057.jpg)10101![](images/00057.jpg)010101![](images/00057.jpg)01010![](images/00057.jpg)10101\n>\n> B:\n> 10001![](images/00057.jpg)0101![](images/00057.jpg)11110![](images/00057.jpg)10111![](images/00057.jpg)01001![](images/00057.jpg)10101![](images/00057.jpg)00001![](images/00057.jpg)100010![](images/00057.jpg)01111![](images/00057.jpg)01111\n\nIf Alice (A) and Bob (B) both say they generated their strings by flipping a\ncoin, no one will ever believe Alice. The strings are surely not equally\nrandom. Classical probability theory offers no solid reason for claiming that\nB is more random than A, because a random process _could_ produce either\nstring. Probability is about ensembles, not individual events. Probability\ntheory treats events statistically. It does not like questions in the form\n“How likely was that to happen?” If it happened, it happened.\n\nTo Claude Shannon, these strings would look like messages. He would ask, _How\nmuch information_ does each string contain? On their face, they both contain\nfifty bits. A telegraph operator charging by the digit would measure the\nlength of the messages and give Alice and Bob the same bill. Then again, the\ntwo messages seem to differ profoundly. Message A immediately becomes boring:\nonce you see the pattern, further repetitions provide no new information. In\nmessage B, every bit is as valuable as every other. Shannon’s first\nformulation of information theory treated messages statistically, as choices\nfrom the ensemble of all possible messages—in the case of A and B, 250 of\nthem. But Shannon also considered redundancy within a message: the pattern,\nthe regularity, the order that makes a message compressible. The more\nregularity in a message, the more predictable it is. The more predictable, the\nmore redundant. The more redundant a message is, the less information it\ncontains.\n\nThe telegraph operator sending message A has a shortcut: he can transmit\nsomething like “Repeat ‘01’ twenty-five times.” For longer messages with easy\npatterns, the savings in keystrokes becomes enormous. Once the pattern is\nclear, the extra characters are free. The operator for message B must soldier\non the hard way, sending every character, because every character is a\ncomplete surprise; every character costs one bit. This pair of questions— _how\nrandom_ and _how much information_ —turn out to be one and the same. They have\na single answer.\n\nChaitin was not thinking about telegraphs. The device he could not get out of\nhis head was the Turing machine—that impossibly elegant abstraction, marching\nback and forth along its infinite paper tape, reading and writing symbols.\nFree from all the real world’s messiness, free from creaking wheel-work and\nfinical electricity, free from any need for speed, the Turing machine was the\nideal computer. Von Neumann, too, had kept coming back to Turing machines.\nThey were the ever-handy lab mice of computer theory. Turing’s _U_ had a\ntranscendent power: a universal Turing machine can simulate any other digital\ncomputer, so computer scientists can disregard the messy details of any\nparticular make or model. This is liberating.\n\nClaude Shannon, having moved from Bell Labs to MIT, reanalyzed the Turing\nmachine in 1956. He stripped it down to the smallest possible skeleton,\nproving that the universal computer could be constructed with just two\ninternal states, or with just two symbols, 0 and 1, or blank and nonblank. He\nwrote his proof in words more pragmatic than mathematical: he described\nexactly how the two-state Turing machine would step left and right, “bouncing”\nback and forth to keep track of the larger numbers of states in a more complex\ncomputer. It was all very intricate and specific, redolent of Babbage. For\nexample:\n\n> > When the reading head moves, the state information must be transferred to\n> the next cell of the tape to be visited using only two internal states in\n> machine B. If the next state in machine A is to be (say) state 17 (according\n> to some arbitrary numbering system) this is transferred in machine B by\n> “bouncing” the reading head back and forth between the old cell and the new\n> one 17 times (actually 18 trips to the new cell and 17 back to the old\n> one).[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1327867)\n\nThe “bouncing operation” carries the information from cell to cell, and the\ncells act as “transmitters” and “controllers.”\n\nTuring had titled his great paper “On Computable Numbers,” but of course the\nreal focus was on _un_ computable numbers. Could uncomputable numbers and\nrandom numbers be related? In 1965 Chaitin was an undergraduate at the City\nCollege of New York, writing up a discovery he hoped to submit to a journal;\nit would be his first publication. He began, “In this paper the Turing machine\nis regarded as a general purpose computer and some practical questions are\nasked about programming it.” Chaitin, as a high-school student in the Columbia\nScience Honors Program, had the opportunity to practice programming in machine\nlanguage on giant IBM mainframes, using decks of punched cards—one card for\neach line of a program. He would leave his card deck in the computer center\nand come back the next day for the program’s output. He could run Turing\nmachines in his head, too: _write 0, write 1, write blank, shift tape left,\nshift tape right._ … The universal computer gave him a nice way to distinguish\nbetween numbers like Alice and Bob’s A and B. He could write a program to make\na Turing machine print out “010101 …” a million times, and he could write down\nthe length of that program—quite short. But given a million random digits—no\npattern, no regularity, nothing special at all—there could be no shortcut. The\ncomputer program would have to incorporate the entire number. To make the IBM\nmainframe print out those million digits, he would have to put the whole\nmillion digits into the punched cards. To make the Turing machine do it, he\nwould still need the million digits for input.\n\nHere is another number (in decimal this time):\n\n> C:\n> 3.141![](images/00057.jpg)592![](images/00057.jpg)653![](images/00057.jpg)589![](images/00057.jpg)793![](images/00057.jpg)238![](images/00057.jpg)462![](images/00057.jpg)643![](images/00057.jpg)383![](images/00057.jpg)279![](images/00057.jpg)502![](images/00057.jpg)884![](images/00057.jpg)197![](images/00057.jpg)169![](images/00057.jpg)399![](images/00057.jpg)3751…\n\nThis looks random. Statistically each digit appears with the expected\nfrequency (one in ten); likewise each pair of digits (one in a hundred), each\ntriplet, and so on. A statistician would say it appears to be “normal,” as far\nas anyone can tell. The next digit is always a surprise. The works of\nShakespeare will be in there, eventually. But someone might recognize this as\na familiar number, Π. So it is not random after all.\n\nBut why do we say Π is not random? Chaitin proposed a clear answer: a number\nis not random if it is computable—if a definable computer program will\ngenerate it. Thus computability is a measure of randomness.\n\nFor Turing computability was a yes-or-no quality—a given number either is or\nis not. But we would like to say that some numbers are more random than\nothers—they are less patterned, less orderly. Chaitin said the patterns and\nthe order express computability. Algorithms generate patterns. So we can gauge\ncomputability by looking at _the size of the algorithm_. Given a\nnumber—represented as a string of any length—we ask, what is the length of the\nshortest program that will generate it? Using the language of a Turing\nmachine, that question can have a definite answer, measured in bits.\n\nChaitin’s algorithmic definition of randomness also provides an algorithmic\ndefinition of information: the size of the algorithm measures how much\ninformation a given string contains.\n\nLooking for patterns—seeking the order amid chaos—is what scientists do, too.\nThe eighteen-year-old Chaitin felt this was no accident. He ended this first\npaper by applying algorithmic information theory to the process of science\nitself. “Consider a scientist,” he proposed, “who has been observing a closed\nsystem that once every second either emits a ray of light or does not.”\n\n> > He summarizes his observations in a sequence of 0s and 1s in which a 0\n> represents “ray not emitted” and a 1 represents “ray emitted.” The sequence\n> may start\n>\n\n>> 0110101110 …\n\n>\n\n>> and continue for a few thousand more bits. The scientist then examines the\nsequence in the hope of observing some kind of pattern or law. What does he\nmean by this? It seems plausible that a sequence of 0s and 1s is patternless\nif there is no better way to calculate it than just by writing it all out at\nonce from a table giving the whole\nsequence.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1328245)\n\nBut if the scientist could discover a way to produce the same sequence with an\nalgorithm, a computer program significantly shorter than the sequence, then he\nwould surely know the events were not random. He would say that he had hit\nupon a theory. This is what science always seeks: a simple theory that\naccounts for a large set of facts and allows for prediction of events still to\ncome. It is the famous Occam’s razor. “We are to admit no more causes of\nnatural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their\nappearances,” said Newton, “for nature is pleased with\nsimplicity.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1328597) Newton quantified _mass_\nand _force_ , but _simplicity_ had to wait.\n\nChaitin sent his paper to the _Journal of the Association for Computing\nMachinery_. They were happy to publish it, but one referee mentioned that he\nhad heard rumors of similar work coming from the Soviet Union. Sure enough,\nthe first issue of a new journal arrived (after a journey of months) in early\n1966: ![](images/00058.jpg), _Problems of Information Transmission_. It\ncontained a paper titled “Three Approaches to the Definition of the Concept\n‘Amount of Information,’ ” by A. N. Kolmogorov. Chaitin, who did not read\nRussian, had just time to add a footnote.\n\nAndrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov was the outstanding mathematician of the Soviet\nera. He was born in Tambov, three hundred miles southeast of Moscow, in 1903;\nhis unwed mother, one of three sisters Kolmogorova, died in childbirth, and\nhis aunt Vera raised him in a village near the river Volga. In the waning\nyears of tsarist Russia, this independent-minded woman ran a village school\nand operated a clandestine printing press in her home, sometimes hiding\nforbidden documents under baby Andrei’s\ncradle.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1328899)\n\nMoscow University accepted Andrei Nikolaevich as a student of mathematics soon\nafter the revolution of 1917. Within ten years he was proving a collection of\ninfluential results that took form in what became the theory of probability.\nHis _Foundations of the Theory of Probability_ , published in Russian in 1933\nand in English in 1950, remains the modern classic. But his interests ranged\nwidely, to physics and linguistics as well as other fast-growing branches of\nmathematics. Once he made a foray into genetics but drew back after a\ndangerous run-in with Stalin’s favorite pseudoscientist, Trofim Lysenko.\nDuring World War II Kolmogorov applied his efforts to statistical theory in\nartillery fire and devised a scheme of stochastic distribution of barrage\nballoons to protect Moscow from Nazi bombers. Apart from his war work, he\nstudied turbulence and random processes. He was a Hero of Socialist Labor and\nseven times received the Order of Lenin.\n\nHe first saw Claude Shannon’s _Mathematical Theory of Communication_ rendered\ninto Russian in 1953, purged of its most interesting features by a translator\nworking in Stalin’s heavy shadow. The title became _Statistical Theory of\nElectrical Signal Transmission_. The word _information_ ,\n![](images/00059.jpg), was everywhere replaced with ![](images/00060.jpg),\n_data_. The word _entropy_ was placed in quotation marks to warn the reader\nagainst inferring a connection with entropy in physics. The section applying\ninformation theory to the statistics of natural language was omitted entirely.\nThe result was technical, neutral, juiceless, and thus unlikely to attract\ninterpretation in the terms of Marxist\nideology.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1329271) These were serious concerns;\n“cybernetics” was initially defined in the _Short Philosophical Dictionary_\n(standard reference of ideological orthodoxy) as a “reactionary pseudoscience”\nand “an ideological weapon of imperialist reaction.” Kolmogorov leapt upon\nShannon’s paper nonetheless; he, at least, was unafraid to use the word\n_information_. Working with his students in Moscow, he put forth a rigorous\nmathematical formulation of information theory, with definitions of the\nfundamental concepts, careful proofs, and new discoveries—some of which, he\nsoon learned to his sorrow, had appeared in Shannon’s original paper but had\nbeen omitted from the Russian version.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1329673)\n\nIn the Soviet Union, still moderately isolated from the rest of the world’s\nscience, Kolmogorov was well placed to carry the banner of information. He was\nin charge of all mathematics in the _Great Soviet Encyclopedia_ , choosing the\nauthors, editing the articles, and writing much of it himself. In 1956 he\ndelivered a long plenary report on the theory of information transmission to\nthe Soviet Academy of Sciences. His colleagues thought this was a bit\n“addled”—that Shannon’s work was “more technology than\nmathematics,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1330125) as Kolmogorov recalled it\nafterward. “It is true,” he said, “that Shannon left to his successors the\nrigorous ‘justification’ of his ideas in some difficult cases. However, his\nmathematical intuition was amazingly precise.” Kolmogorov was not as\nenthusiastic about cybernetics. Norbert Wiener felt a kinship with him—they\nhad both done early work on stochastic processes and Brownian motion. On a\nvisit to Moscow, Wiener said, “When I read the works of Academician\nKolmogorov, I feel that these are my thoughts as well, this is what I wanted\nto say. And I know that Academician Kolmogorov has the same feeling when\nreading my works.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1330509) But the feeling was\nevidently not shared. Kolmogorov steered his colleagues toward Shannon\ninstead. “It is easy to understand that as a mathematical discipline\ncybernetics in Wiener’s understanding lacks unity,” he said, “and it is\ndifficult to imagine productive work in training a specialist, say a\npostgraduate student, in cybernetics in this\nsense.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1330839) He already had real results to\nback up his instincts: a useful generalized formulation of Shannon entropy,\nand an extension of his information measure to processes in both discrete and\ncontinuous time.\n\nPrestige in Russia was finally beginning to flow toward any work that promised\nto aid electronic communication and computing. Such work began almost in a\nvoid. Pragmatic electrical engineering barely existed; Soviet telephony was\nnotoriously dismal, a subject for eternally bitter Russian humor. As of 1965,\nthere was still no such thing as direct long-distance dialing. The number of\ntoll calls nationally had yet to surpass the number of telegrams, a milestone\nthat had been reached in the United States before the end of the previous\ncentury. Moscow had fewer telephones per capita than any major world city.\nNonetheless, Kolmogorov and his students generated enough activity to justify\na new quarterly journal, _Problems of Information Transmission_ , devoted to\ninformation theory, coding theory, theory of networks, and even information in\nliving organisms. The inaugural issue opened with Kolmogorov’s “Three\nApproaches to the Definition of the Concept ‘Amount of Information’”—almost a\nmanifesto—which then began its slow journey toward the awareness of\nmathematicians in the West.\n\n“At each given moment there is only a fine layer between the ‘trivial’ and the\nimpossible,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1331125) Kolmogorov mused in his\ndiary. “Mathematical discoveries are made in this layer.” In the new,\nquantitative view of information he saw a way to attack a problem that had\neluded probability theory, the problem of randomness. How much information is\ncontained in a given “finite object”? An object could be a number (a series of\ndigits) or a message or a set of data.\n\nHe described three approaches: the combinatorial, the probabilistic, and the\nalgorithmic. The first and second were Shannon’s, with refinements. They\nfocused on the probability of one object among an ensemble of objects—one\nparticular message, say, chosen from a set of possible messages. How would\nthis work, Kolmogorov wondered, when the object was not just a symbol in an\nalphabet or a lantern in a church window but something big and complicated—a\ngenetic organism, or a work of art? How would one measure the amount of\ninformation in Tolstoy’s _War and Peace_? “Is it possible to include this\nnovel in a reasonable way in the set of ‘all possible novels’ and further to\npostulate the existence of a certain probability distribution in this\nset?”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1331413) he asked. Or could one measure\nthe amount of genetic information in, say, the cuckoo bird by considering a\nprobability distribution in the set of all possible species?\n\nHis third approach to measuring information—the algorithmic—avoided the\ndifficulties of starting with ensembles of possible objects. It focused on the\nobject itself.*[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1331762) Kolmogorov introduced a\nnew word for the thing he was trying to measure: _complexity_. As he defined\nthis term, the complexity of a number, or message, or set of data is the\ninverse of simplicity and order and, once again, it corresponds to\ninformation. The simpler an object is, the less information it conveys. The\nmore complexity, the more information. And, just as Gregory Chaitin did,\nKolmogorov put this idea on a solid mathematical footing by calculating\ncomplexity in terms of algorithms. The complexity of an object is the size of\nthe smallest computer program needed to generate it. An object that can be\nproduced by a short algorithm has little complexity. On the other hand, an\nobject needing an algorithm every bit as long as the object itself has maximal\ncomplexity.\n\nA simple object can be generated—or computed, or described—with just a few\nbits. A complex object requires an algorithm of many bits. Put this way, it\nseemed obvious. But until now it had not been understood mathematically.\nKolmogorov put it this way:\n\n> > The intuitive difference between “simple” and “complicated” objects has\n> apparently been perceived a long time ago. On the way to its formalization,\n> an obvious difficulty arises: something that can be described simply in one\n> language may not have a simple description in another and it is not clear\n> what method of description should be\n> chosen.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1332124)\n\nThat difficulty is solved by using computer language. It does not matter which\ncomputer language, because they are all equivalent, reducible to the language\nof a universal Turing machine. The Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the\nsize, in bits, of the shortest algorithm needed to generate it. This is also\nthe amount of information. And it is also the degree of randomness—Kolmogorov\ndeclared “a new conception of the notion ‘random’ corresponding to the natural\nassumption that randomness is the absence of\nregularity.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1332529) The three are\nfundamentally equivalent: information, randomness, and complexity—three\npowerful abstractions, bound all along like secret lovers.\n\nFor Kolmogorov, these ideas belonged not only to probability theory but also\nto physics. To measure the complexity of an orderly crystal or a helter-\nskelter box of gas, one could measure the shortest algorithm needed to\ndescribe the state of the crystal or gas. Once again entropy was the key.\nKolmogorov had a useful background in difficult physical problems to which\nthese new methods could be applied. In 1941 he had produced the first useful,\nthough flawed, understanding of the local structure of turbulent\nflows—equations to predict the distribution of whorls and eddies. He had also\nworked on perturbations in planetary orbits, another problem surprisingly\nintractable for classical Newtonian physics. Now he began laying the\ngroundwork for the renaissance in chaos theory to come in the 1970s: analyzing\ndynamical systems in terms of entropy and information dimension. It made sense\nnow to say that a dynamical system produces information. If it is\nunpredictable, it produces a great deal of information.\n\nKolmogorov knew nothing of Gregory Chaitin, nor did either man know of an\nAmerican probability theorist named Ray Solomonoff, who had developed some of\nthe same ideas. The world was changing. Time, distance, and language still\ndivided mathematicians in Russia from their Western counterparts, but the gulf\nnarrowed every year. Kolmogorov often said that no one should do mathematics\nafter the age of sixty. He dreamed of spending his last years as a buoy keeper\non the Volga, making a watery circuit in a boat with oars and a small\nsail.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1332891) When the time came, buoy keepers\nhad switched to motorboats, and for Kolmogorov, this ruined the dream.\n\nNow the paradoxes returned.\n\nZero is an interesting number. Books have been written about it. One is\ncertainly an interesting number—it is the first and the foremost (not counting\nzero), the singular and unique. Two is interesting in all kinds of ways: the\nsmallest prime, the definitive even number, the number needed for a successful\nmarriage, the atomic number of helium, the number of candles to light on\nFinnish Independence Day. _Interesting_ is an everyday word, not\nmathematicians’ jargon. It seems safe to say that any small number is\ninteresting. All the two-digit numbers and many of the three-digit numbers\nhave their own Wikipedia entries.\n\nNumber theorists name entire classes of interesting numbers: prime numbers,\nperfect numbers, squares and cubes, Fibonacci numbers, factorials. The number\n593 is more interesting than it looks; it happens to be the sum of nine\nsquared and two to the ninth—thus a “Leyland number” (any number that can be\nexpressed as _x_ _y_ \\+ _y_ _x_). Wikipedia also devotes an article to the\nnumber 9,814,072,356. It is the largest holodigital square—which is to say,\nthe largest square number containing each decimal digit exactly once.\n\nWhat would be an uninteresting number? Presumably a random number. The English\nnumber theorist G. H. Hardy randomly rode in taxi No. 1729 on his way to visit\nthe ailing Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1917 and remarked to his colleague that, as\nnumbers go, 1,729 was “rather a dull one.” On the contrary, replied Ramanujan\n(according to a standard anecdote of mathematicians), it is the smallest\nnumber expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.* “Every\npositive integer is one of Ramanujan’s personal friends,” remarked J. E.\nLittlewood. Due to the anecdote, 1,729 is known nowadays as the Hardy-\nRamanujan number. Nor is that all; 1,729 also happens to be a Carmichael\nnumber, an Euler pseudoprime, and a Zeisel number.\n\nBut even the mind of Ramanujan was finite, as is Wikipedia, as is the\naggregate sum of human knowledge, so the list of interesting numbers must end\nsomewhere. Surely there must be a number about which there is nothing special\nto say. Wherever it is, there stands a paradox: the number we may describe,\ninterestingly, as “the smallest uninteresting number.”\n\nThis is none other than Berry’s paradox reborn, the one described by Bertrand\nRussell in _Principia Mathematica_. Berry and Russell had devilishly asked,\nWhat is the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables?\nWhatever this number is, it can be named in eighteen syllables: _the least\ninteger not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables_. Explanations for why a\nnumber is interesting are ways of naming the number: “the square of eleven,”\nfor example, or “the number of stars in the American flag.” Some of these\nnames do not seem particularly helpful, and some are rather fuzzy. Some are\npure mathematical facts: whether, for example, a number is expressible as the\nsum of two cubes in two different ways. But some are facts about the world, or\nabout language, or about human beings, and they may be accidental and\nephemeral—for example, whether a number corresponds to a subway stop or a date\nin history.\n\nChaitin and Kolmogorov revived Berry’s paradox in inventing algorithmic\ninformation theory. An algorithm names a number. “The paradox originally talks\nabout English, but that’s much too\nvague,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1333188) Chaitin says. “I pick a\ncomputer-programming language instead.” Naturally he picks the language of a\nuniversal Turing machine.\n\n> > And then what does it mean, how do you name an integer? Well, you name an\n> integer by giving a way to calculate it. A program names an integer if its\n> output is that integer—you know, it outputs that integer, just one, and then\n> it stops.\n\nAsking whether a number is interesting is the inverse of asking whether it is\nrandom. If the number _n_ can be computed by an algorithm that is relatively\nshort, then _n_ is interesting. If not, it is random. The algorithm PRINT 1\nAND THEN PRINT 100 ZEROES generates an interesting number (a googol).\nSimilarly, FIND THE FIRST PRIME NUMBER, ADD THE NEXT PRIME NUMBER, AND REPEAT\nA MILLION TIMES generates a number that is interesting: the sum of the first\nmillion primes. It would take a Turing machine a long time to compute that\nparticular number, but a finite time nonetheless. The number is computable.\n\nBut if the most concise algorithm for _n_ is “PRINT [_n_]”—an algorithm\nincorporating the entire number, with no shorthand—then we may say that there\nis nothing interesting about _n_. In Kolmogorov’s terms, this number is\nrandom—maximally complex. It will have to be patternless, because any pattern\nwould provide a way to devise a shorthand algorithm. “If there is a small,\nconcise computer program that calculates the number, that means it has some\nquality or characteristic that enables you to pick it out and to compress it\ninto a smaller algorithmic description,” Chaitin says. “So that’s unusual;\nthat’s an interesting number.”\n\nBut _is_ it unusual? Looking generally at all the numbers, how can a\nmathematician know whether the interesting ones are rare or common? For that\nmatter, looking at any one number, can a mathematician ever know for sure\nwhether a smaller algorithm might be found? For Chaitin, these were the\ncritical questions.\n\nHe answered the first with a counting argument. The vast majority of numbers\nhave to be uninteresting because there cannot possibly be enough concise\ncomputer programs to go around. Count them. Given 1,000 bits (say), one has\n21000 numbers; but not nearly that many useful computer programs can be\nwritten in 1,000 bits. “There are a lot of positive integers,” Chaitin says.\n“If the programs have to be smaller, then there just aren’t enough of them to\nname all those different positive integers.” So most _n_ ’s of any given\nlength are random.\n\nThe next question was far more troubling. Knowing that most numbers are\nrandom, and given any particular number _n_ , can mathematicians prove it to\nbe random? They cannot tell by looking at it. They can often prove the\nopposite, that _n_ is interesting: in that case they just have to find a short\nalgorithm that generates _n_. (Technically, it must be shorter than log2 _n_\nbits, the number needed to write _n_ in binary.) Proving the negative is a\ndifferent story. “Even though most positive integers are uninteresting,”\nChaitin declared, “you can never be sure.… You can only prove it in a small\nnumber of cases.” One could imagine trying to do it by brute force, writing\ndown every possible algorithm and testing them one by one. But a computer will\nhave to perform the tests—an algorithm testing other algorithms—and soon,\nChaitin demonstrated, a new version of Berry’s paradox appears. Instead of\n“the smallest uninteresting number,” one inevitably encounters a statement in\nthe form of “the smallest number that we can prove cannot be named in fewer\nthan _n_ syllables.” (We are not really talking about syllables any more, of\ncourse, but Turing-machine states.)* It is another recursive, self-looping\ntwist. This was Chaitin’s version of Gödel’s incompleteness. Complexity,\ndefined in terms of program size, is generally uncomputable. Given an\narbitrary string of a million digits, a mathematician knows that it is almost\ncertainly random, complex, and patternless—but cannot be absolutely sure.\n\nChaitin did this work in Buenos Aires. When he was still a teenager, before he\ncould graduate from City College, his parents moved back to their home in\nArgentina, and he got a job there with IBM World Trade. He continued to nurse\nhis obsession with Gödel and incompleteness and to send papers to the American\nMathematical Society and the Association for Computing Machinery. Eight years\nlater, Chaitin returned to the United States to visit IBM’s research center in\nYorktown Heights, New York, and placed a telephone call to his hero, then\nnearing seventy at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Gödel\nanswered, and Chaitin introduced himself and said he had a new approach to\nincompleteness, based on Berry’s paradox instead of the liar paradox.\n\n“It doesn’t make any difference which paradox you\nuse,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1333523) said Gödel.\n\n“Yes, but …” Chaitin said he was on the trail of a new “information-theoretic”\nview of incompleteness and asked if he could call on Gödel in Princeton. He\nwas staying in the YMCA in White Plains and would take the train, changing in\nNew York City. Gödel agreed, but when the day came, he canceled. It was\nsnowing, and he was fearful for his health. Chaitin never did meet him. Gödel,\nincreasingly unstable, afraid of poisoning, died in the winter of 1978 of\nself-starvation.\n\nChaitin spent the rest of his career at the IBM Watson Research Center, one of\nthe last great scientists to be so well supported in work of no plausible use\nto his corporate patron. He sometimes said he was “hiding” in a physics\ndepartment; he felt that more conventional mathematicians dismissed him as “a\ncloset physicist” anyway. His work treated mathematics as a sort of empirical\nscience—not a Platonic pipeline to absolute truth, but a research program\nsubject to the world’s contingencies and uncertainties. “In spite of\nincompleteness and uncomputability and even algorithmic randomness,” he said,\n“mathematicians don’t want to give up absolute certainty. Why? Well, absolute\ncertainty is like God.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1333907)\n\nIn quantum physics and later in chaos, scientists found the limits to their\nknowledge. They explored the fruitful uncertainty that at first so vexed\nEinstein, who did not want to believe that God plays dice with the universe.\nAlgorithmic information theory applies the same limitations to the universe of\nwhole numbers—an ideal, mental universe. As Chaitin put it, “God not only\nplays dice in quantum mechanics and nonlinear dynamics, but even in elementary\nnumber theory.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1334132)\n\nAmong its lessons were these:\n\n  * Most numbers are random. Yet very few of them can be _proved_ random.\n  * A chaotic stream of information may yet hide a simple algorithm. Working backward from the chaos to the algorithm may be impossible.\n  * Kolmogorov-Chaitin (KC) complexity is to mathematics what entropy is to thermodynamics: the antidote to perfection. Just as we can have no perpetual-motion machines, there can be no complete formal axiomatic systems.\n  * Some mathematical facts are true for no reason. They are accidental, lacking a cause or deeper meaning.\n\nJoseph Ford, a physicist studying the behavior of unpredictable dynamical\nsystems in the 1980s, said that Chaitin had “charmingly captured the essence\nof the matter”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1334428) by showing the path from\nGödel’s incompleteness to chaos. This was the “deeper meaning of chaos,” Ford\ndeclared:\n\n> > Chaotic orbits exist but they are Gödel’s children, so complex, so\n> overladen with information that humans can never comprehend them. But chaos\n> is ubiquitous in nature; therefore the universe is filled with countless\n> mysteries that man can never understand.\n\nYet one still tries to take their measure.\n\n_How much information_ …?\n\nWhen an object (a number or a bitstream or a dynamical system) can be\nexpressed a different way in fewer bits, it is compressible. A frugal\ntelegraph operator prefers to send the compressed version. Because the spirit\nof frugal telegraph operators kept the lights on at Bell Labs, it was natural\nfor Claude Shannon to explore data compression, both theory and practice.\nCompression was fundamental to his vision: his war work on cryptography\nanalyzed the disguising of information at one end and the recovery of the\ninformation at the other; data compression likewise encodes the information,\nwith a different motivation—the efficient use of bandwidth. Satellite\ntelevision channels, pocket music players, efficient cameras and telephones\nand countless other modern appurtenances depend on coding algorithms to\ncompress numbers—sequences of bits—and those algorithms trace their lineage to\nShannon’s original 1948 paper.\n\nThe first of these, now called Shannon-Fano coding, came from his colleague\nRobert M. Fano. It began with the simple idea of assigning short codes to\nfrequent symbols, as in Morse code. They knew their method was not optimal,\nhowever: it could not be relied on to produce the shortest possible messages.\nWithin three years it was surpassed by work of a graduate student of Fano’s at\nMIT, David Huffman. In the decades since, versions of the Huffman coding\nalgorithm have squeezed many, many bytes.\n\nRay Solomonoff, a child of Russian immigrants who studied at the University of\nChicago, encountered Shannon’s work in the early 1950s and began thinking\nabout what he called the Information Packing Problem: how much information\ncould one “pack” into a given number of bits, or conversely, given some\ninformation, how could one pack it into the fewest possible\nbits.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1334754) He had majored in physics,\nstudied mathematical biology and probability and logic on the side, and gotten\nto know Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, pioneers in what would soon be called\nartificial intelligence. Then he read Noam Chomsky’s offbeat and original\npaper “Three Models for the Description of\nLanguage,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1335072) applying the new\ninformation-theoretic ideas to the formalization of structure in language. All\nthis was bouncing around in Solomonoff’s mind; he was not sure where it led,\nbut he found himself focusing on the problem of _induction_. How do people\ncreate theories to account for their experience of the world? They have to\nmake generalizations, find patterns in data that are always influenced by\nrandomness and noise. Could one enable a machine to do that? In other words,\ncould a computer be made to learn from experience?\n\nHe worked out an elaborate answer and published it in 1964. It was\nidiosyncratic, and hardly anyone noticed until the 1970s, when both Chaitin\nand Kolmogorov discovered that Solomonoff had anticipated the essential\nfeatures of what by then was called algorithmic information theory. In effect,\nSolomonoff, too, had been figuring out how a computer might look at sequences\nof data—number sequences or bit strings—and measure their randomness and their\nhidden patterns. When humans or computers learn from experience, they are\nusing induction: recognizing regularities amid irregular streams of\ninformation. From this point of view, the laws of science represent data\ncompression in action. A theoretical physicist acts like a very clever coding\nalgorithm. “The laws of science that have been discovered can be viewed as\nsummaries of large amounts of empirical data about the\nuniverse,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1335417) wrote Solomonoff. “In the\npresent context, each such law can be transformed into a method of compactly\ncoding the empirical data that gave rise to that law.” A good scientific\ntheory is economical. This was yet another way of saying so.\n\nSolomonoff, Kolmogorov, and Chaitin tackled three different problems and came\nup with the same answer. Solomonoff was interested in inductive inference:\ngiven a sequence of observations, how can one make the best predictions about\nwhat will come next? Kolmogorov was looking for a mathematical definition of\nrandomness: what does it mean to say that one sequence is more random than\nanother, when they have the same probability of emerging from a series of coin\nflips? And Chaitin was trying to find a deep path into Gödel incompleteness by\nway of Turing and Shannon—as he said later, “putting Shannon’s information\ntheory and Turing’s computability theory into a cocktail shaker and shaking\nvigorously.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1335745) They all arrived at\nminimal program size. And they all ended up talking about complexity.\n\nThe following bitstream (or number) is not very complex, because it is\nrational:\n\n> > D:\n> 14![](images/00057.jpg)285![](images/00057.jpg)714![](images/00057.jpg)285![](images/00057.jpg)714![](images/00057.jpg)285![](images/00057.jpg)714![](images/00057.jpg)285![](images/00057.jpg)714![](images/00057.jpg)285![](images/00057.jpg)714![](images/00057.jpg)285![](images/00057.jpg)714![](images/00057.jpg)285![](images/00057.jpg)714![](images/00057.jpg)285![](images/00057.jpg)714…\n\nIt may be rephrased concisely as “PRINT 142857 AND REPEAT,” or even more\nconcisely as “1/7.” If it is a message, the compression saves keystrokes. If\nit is an incoming stream of data, the observer may recognize a pattern, grow\nmore and more confident, and settle on _one-seventh_ as a theory for the data.\n\nIn contrast, this sequence contains a late surprise:\n\n> > E:\n> 101![](images/00057.jpg)01![](images/00057.jpg)010![](images/00057.jpg)101![](images/00057.jpg)010![](images/00057.jpg)101![](images/00057.jpg)010![](images/00057.jpg)101![](images/00057.jpg)010![](images/00057.jpg)101![](images/00057.jpg)010![](images/00057.jpg)101![](images/00057.jpg)010![](images/00057.jpg)101![](images/00057.jpg)010![](images/00057.jpg)101![](images/00057.jpg)013\n\nThe telegraph operator (or theorist, or compression algorithm) must pay\nattention to the whole message. Nonetheless, the extra information is minimal;\nthe message can still be compressed, wherever pattern exists. We may say it\ncontains a redundant part and an arbitrary part.\n\nIt was Shannon who first showed that anything nonrandom in a message allows\ncompression:\n\n> > F:\n> 101![](images/00057.jpg)101![](images/00057.jpg)0111![](images/00057.jpg)1011![](images/00057.jpg)0110![](images/00057.jpg)1011![](images/00057.jpg)1010![](images/00057.jpg)1110![](images/00057.jpg)1111![](images/00057.jpg)0100![](images/00057.jpg)1110![](images/00057.jpg)1101![](images/00057.jpg)0011![](images/00057.jpg)1101![](images/00057.jpg)110\n\nHeavy on ones, light on zeroes, this might be emitted by the flip of a biased\ncoin. Huffman coding and other such algorithms exploit statistical\nregularities to compress the data. Photographs are compressible because of\ntheir subjects’ natural structure: light pixels and dark pixels come in\nclusters; statistically, nearby pixels are likely to be similar; distant\npixels are not. Video is even more compressible, because the differences\nbetween one frame and the next are relatively slight, except when the subject\nis in fast and turbulent motion. Natural language is compressible because of\nredundancies and regularities of the kind Shannon analyzed. Only a wholly\nrandom sequence remains incompressible: nothing but one surprise after\nanother.\n\nRandom sequences are “normal”—a term of art meaning that on average, in the\nlong run, each digit appears exactly as often as the others, one time in ten;\nand each pair of digits, from 00 to 99, appears one time in a hundred; and\neach triplet likewise, and so on. No string of any particular length is more\nlikely to appear than any other string of that length. Normality is one of\nthose simple-seeming ideas that, when mathematicians look closely, turn out to\nbe covered with thorns. Even though a truly random sequence must be normal,\nthe reverse is not necessarily the case. A number can be statistically normal\nyet not random at all. David Champernowne, a young Cambridge friend of\nTuring’s, invented (or discovered) such a creature in 1933—a construction made\nof all the integers, chained together in order:\n\n> > G:\n> 12![](images/00057.jpg)34![](images/00057.jpg)567![](images/00057.jpg)891![](images/00057.jpg)011![](images/00057.jpg)121![](images/00057.jpg)314![](images/00057.jpg)151![](images/00057.jpg)617![](images/00057.jpg)181![](images/00057.jpg)920![](images/00057.jpg)212![](images/00057.jpg)223![](images/00057.jpg)242![](images/00057.jpg)526![](images/00057.jpg)272![](images/00057.jpg)8293…\n\nIt is easy to see that each digit, and each combination of digits, occurs\nequally often in the long run. Yet the sequence could not be less random. It\nis rigidly structured and completely predictable. If you know where you are,\nyou know what comes next.\n\nEven apart from freaks like Champernowne’s, it turns out that normal numbers\nare difficult to recognize. In the universe of numbers, normality is the rule;\nmathematicians know for sure that almost all numbers are normal. The rational\nnumbers are not normal, and there are infinitely many rational numbers, but\nthey are infinitely outnumbered by normal numbers. Yet, having settled the\ngreat and general question, mathematicians can almost never prove that any\nparticular number is normal. This in itself is one of the more remarkable\noddities of mathematics.\n\nEven Π retains some mysteries:\n\n> > C:\n> 3.141![](images/00057.jpg)592![](images/00057.jpg)653![](images/00057.jpg)589![](images/00057.jpg)793![](images/00057.jpg)238![](images/00057.jpg)462![](images/00057.jpg)643![](images/00057.jpg)383![](images/00057.jpg)279![](images/00057.jpg)5028![](images/00057.jpg)841![](images/00057.jpg)971![](images/00057.jpg)693![](images/00057.jpg)993![](images/00057.jpg)751…\n\nThe world’s computers have spent many cycles analyzing the first trillion or\nso known decimal digits of this cosmic message, and as far as anyone can tell,\nthey appear normal. No statistical features have been discovered—no biases or\ncorrelations, local or remote. It is a quintessentially nonrandom number that\nseems to behave randomly. Given the _n_ th digit, there is no shortcut for\nguessing the _n_ th plus one. Once again, the next bit is always a surprise.\n\nHow much information, then, is represented by this string of digits? Is it\ninformation rich, like a random number? Or information poor, like an ordered\nsequence?\n\nThe telegraph operator could, of course, save many keystrokes—infinitely many,\nin the long run—by simply sending the message “Π.” But this is a cheat. It\npresumes knowledge previously shared by the sender and the receiver. The\nsender has to recognize this special sequence to begin with, and then the\nreceiver has to know what Π is, and how to look up its decimal expansion, or\nelse how to compute it. In effect, they need to share a code book.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that Π contains a lot of information. The\nessential message can be sent in fewer keystrokes. The telegraph operator has\nseveral strategies available. For example, he could say, “Take 4, subtract\n4/3, add 4/5, subtract 4/7, and so on.” The telegraph operator sends an\nalgorithm, that is. This infinite series of fractions converges slowly upon Π,\nso the recipient has a lot of work to do, but the message itself is\neconomical: the total information content is the same no matter how many\ndecimal digits are required.\n\nThe issue of shared knowledge at the far ends of the line brings\ncomplications. Sometimes people like to frame this sort of problem—the problem\nof information content in messages—in terms of communicating with an alien\nlife-form in a faraway galaxy. What could we tell them? What would we want to\nsay? The laws of mathematics being universal, we tend to think that Π would be\none message any intelligent race would recognize. Only, they could hardly be\nexpected to know the Greek letter. Nor would they be likely to recognize the\ndecimal digits “3.1415926535 …” unless they happened to have ten fingers.\n\nThe sender of a message can never fully know his recipient’s mental code book.\nTwo lights in a window might mean nothing or might mean “The British come by\nsea.” Every poem is a message, different for every reader. There is a way to\nmake the fuzziness of this line of thinking go away. Chaitin expressed it this\nway:\n\n> > It is preferable to consider communication not with a distant friend but\n> with a digital computer. The friend might have the wit to make inferences\n> about numbers or to construct a series from partial information or from\n> vague instructions. The computer does not have that capacity, and for our\n> purposes that deficiency is an advantage. Instructions given the computer\n> must be complete and explicit, and they must enable it to proceed step by\n> step.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1336002)\n\nIn other words: the message is an algorithm. The recipient is a machine; it\nhas no creativity, no uncertainty, and no knowledge, except whatever\n“knowledge” is inherent in the machine’s structure. By the 1960s, digital\ncomputers were already getting their instructions in a form measured in bits,\nso it was natural to think about how much information was contained in any\nalgorithm.\n\nA different sort of message would be this:\n\n![](images/00061.jpg)\n\nEven to the eye this sequence of notes seems nonrandom. It happens that the\nmessage they represent is already making its way through interstellar space,\n10 billion miles from its origin, at a tiny fraction of light speed. The\nmessage is not encoded in this print-based notation, nor in any digital form,\nbut as microscopic waves in a single long groove winding in a spiral engraved\non a disc twelve inches in diameter and one-fiftieth of an inch in thickness.\nThe disc might have been vinyl, but in this case it was copper, plated with\ngold. This analog means of capturing, preserving, and reproducing sound was\ninvented in 1877 by Thomas Edison, who called it phonography. It remained the\nmost popular audio technology a hundred years later—though not for much\nlonger—and in 1977 a committee led by the astronomer Carl Sagan created a\nparticular phonograph record and stowed copies in a pair of spacecraft named\n_Voyager 1_ and _Voyager 2_ , each the size of a small automobile, launched\nthat summer from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nSo it is a message in an interstellar bottle. The message has no meaning,\napart from its patterns, which is to say that it is abstract art: the first\nprelude of Johann Sebastian Bach’s _Well-Tempered Clavier_ , as played on the\npiano by Glenn Gould. More generally, perhaps the meaning is “There is\nintelligent life here.” Besides the Bach prelude, the record includes music\nsamples from several different cultures and a selection of earthly sounds:\nwind, surf, and thunder; spoken greetings in fifty-five languages; the voices\nof crickets, frogs, and whales; a ship’s horn, the clatter of a horse-drawn\ncart, and a tapping in Morse code. Along with the phonograph record are a\ncartridge and needle and a brief pictographic instruction manual. The\ncommittee did not bother with a phonograph player or a source of electrical\npower. Maybe the aliens will find a way to convert those analog metallic\ngrooves into waves in whatever fluid serves as their atmosphere—or into some\nother suitable input for their alien senses.\n\n![](images/00062.jpg)\n\nTHE “GOLDEN RECORD” STOWED ABOARD THE VOYAGER SPACECRAFT [(Illustration credit\n12.1)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1937151)\n\nWould they recognize the intricate patterned structure of the Bach prelude\n(say), as distinct from the less interesting, more random chatter of crickets?\nWould the sheet music convey a clearer message—the written notes containing,\nafter all, the essence of Bach’s creation? And, more generally, what kind of\nknowledge would be needed at the far end of the line—what kind of code book—to\ndecipher the message? An appreciation of counterpoint and voice leading? A\nsense of the tonal context and performance practices of the European Baroque?\nThe sounds—the notes—come in groups; they form shapes, called melodies; they\nobey the rules of an implicit grammar. Does the music carry its own logic with\nit, independent of geography and history? On earth, meanwhile, within a few\nyears, even before the _Voyagers_ had sailed past the solar system’s edge,\nmusic was seldom recorded in analog form anymore. Better to store the sounds\nof the _Well-Tempered Clavier_ as bits: the waveforms discretized without loss\nas per the Shannon sampling theorem, and the information preserved in dozens\nof plausible media.\n\nIn terms of bits, a Bach prelude might not seem to have much information at\nall. As penned by Bach on two manuscript pages, this one amounts to six\nhundred notes, characters in a small alphabet. As Glenn Gould played it on a\npiano in 1964—adding the performer’s layers of nuance and variation to the\nbare instructions—it lasts a minute and thirty-six seconds. The sound of that\nperformance, recorded onto a CD, microscopic pits burned by a laser onto a\nslim disc of polycarbonate plastic, comprises 135 million bits. But this\nbitstream can be compressed considerably with no loss of information.\nAlternatively, the prelude fits on a small player-piano roll (descendant of\nJacquard’s loom, predecessor of punched-card computing); encoded\nelectronically with the MIDI protocol, it uses a few thousands bits. Even the\nbasic six-hundred-character message has tremendous redundancy: unvarying\ntempo, uniform timbre, just a brief melodic pattern, a word, repeated over and\nover with slight variations till the final bars. It is famously, deceptively\nsimple. The very repetition creates expectations and breaks them. Hardly\nanything happens, and everything is a surprise. “Immortal broken chords of\nradiantly white harmonies,” said Wanda Landowska. It is simple the way a\nRembrandt drawing is simple. It does a lot with a little. Is it then rich in\ninformation? Certain music could be considered information poor. At one\nextreme John Cage’s composition titled _4′33″_ contains no “notes” at all:\njust four minutes and thirty-three seconds of near silence, as the piece\nabsorbs the ambient sounds around the still pianist—the listeners’ shifting in\ntheir seats, rustling clothes, breathing, sighing.\n\n![](images/00063.jpg)\n\nHow much information in the Bach C-major Prelude? As a set of patterns, in\ntime and frequency, it can be analyzed, traced, and understood, but only up to\na point. In music, as in poetry, as in any art, perfect understanding is meant\nto remain elusive. If one could find the bottom it would be a bore.\n\nIn a way, then, the use of minimal program size to define complexity seems\nperfect—a fitting apogee for Shannon information theory. In another way it\nremains deeply unsatisfying. This is particularly so when turning to the big\nquestions—one might say, the human questions—of art, of biology, of\nintelligence.\n\nAccording to this measure, a million zeroes and a million coin tosses lie at\nopposite ends of the spectrum. The empty string is as simple as can be; the\nrandom string is maximally complex. The zeroes convey no information; coin\ntosses produce the most information possible. Yet these extremes have\nsomething in common. They are dull. They have no value. If either one were a\nmessage from another galaxy, we would attribute no intelligence to the sender.\nIf they were music, they would be equally worthless.\n\nEverything we care about lies somewhere in the middle, where pattern and\nrandomness interlace.\n\nChaitin and a colleague, Charles H. Bennett, sometimes discussed these matters\nat IBM’s research center in Yorktown Heights, New York. Over a period of\nyears, Bennett developed a new measure of value, which he called “logical\ndepth.” Bennett’s idea of depth is connected to complexity but orthogonal to\nit. It is meant to capture the usefulness of a message, whatever usefulness\nmight mean in any particular domain. “From the earliest days of information\ntheory it has been appreciated that information per se is not a good measure\nof message value,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1336322) he wrote, finally\npublishing his scheme in 1988.\n\n> > A typical sequence of coin tosses has high information content but little\n> value; an ephemeris, giving the positions of the moon and planets every day\n> for a hundred years, has no more information than the equations of motion\n> and initial conditions from which it was calculated, but saves its owner the\n> effort of recalculating these positions.\n\nThe amount of work it takes to compute something had been mostly\ndisregarded—set aside—in all the theorizing based on Turing machines, which\nwork, after all, so ploddingly. Bennett brought it back. There is no logical\ndepth in the parts of a message that are sheer randomness and\nunpredictability, nor is there logical depth in obvious redundancy—plain\nrepetition and copying. Rather, he proposed, the value of a message lies in\n“what might be called its buried redundancy—parts predictable only with\ndifficulty, things the receiver could in principle have figured out without\nbeing told, but only at considerable cost in money, time, or computation.”\nWhen we value an object’s complexity, or its information content, we are\nsensing a lengthy hidden computation. This might be true of music or a poem or\na scientific theory or a crossword puzzle, which gives its solver pleasure\nwhen it is neither too cryptic nor too shallow, but somewhere in between.\n\nMathematicians and logicians had developed a tendency to think of information\nprocessing as free—not like pumping water or carrying stones. In our time, it\ncertainly has gotten cheap. But it embodies work after all, and Bennett\nsuggests that we recognize this work, reckon its expense in understanding\ncomplexity. “The more subtle something is, the harder it is to discover,”\nBennett says. He applied the idea of logical depth to the problem of self-\norganization: the question of how complex structures develop in nature.\nEvolution starts with simple initial conditions; complexity arises, apparently\nbuilding on itself. Whatever the basic processes involved, physical or\nbiological, something is under way that begins to resemble computation.\n\n* * *\n\n* “Our definition of the quantity of information has the advantage that it refers to individual objects and not to objects treated as members of a set of objects with a probability distribution given on it. The probabilistic definition can be convincingly applied to the information contained, for example, in a stream of congratulatory telegrams. But it would not be clear how to apply it, for example, to an estimate of the quantity of information contained in a novel or in the translation of a novel into another language relative to the original.”\n\n* 1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103\n\n* More precisely, it looked like this: “The finite binary sequence S with the first proof that S cannot be described by a Turing machine with n states or less” is a (log2 n+cF)–state description of S.\n\n\n# 13 | INFORMATION IS PHYSICAL\n\n\n##\n\n> (It from Bit)\n\n> _The more energy, the faster the bits flip.

It is happily riddled with mysteries. It blithely\ndisregards human intuition. Albert Einstein died unreconciled to its\nconsequences, and Richard Feynman was not joking when he said no one\nunderstands it. Perhaps arguments about the nature of reality are to be\nexpected; quantum physics, so uncannily successful in practice, deals in\ntheory with the foundations of all things, and its own foundations are\ncontinually being rebuilt. Even so, the ferment sometimes seems more religious\nthan scientific.\n\n“How did this come about?”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1337094) asks\nChristopher Fuchs, a quantum theorist at Bell Labs and then the Perimeter\nInstitute in Canada.\n\n> > Go to any meeting, and it is like being in a holy city in great tumult.\n> You will find all the religions with all their priests pitted in holy\n> war—the Bohmians, the Consistent Historians, the Transactionalists, the\n> Spontaneous Collapseans, the Einselectionists, the Contextual Objectivists,\n> the outright Everettics, and many more beyond that. They all declare to see\n> the light, the ultimate light. Each tells us that if we will accept their\n> solution as our savior, then we too will see the light.\n\nIt is time, he says, to start fresh. Throw away the existing quantum axioms,\nexquisite and mathematical as they are, and turn to deep physical principles.\n“Those principles should be crisp; they should be compelling. They should stir\nthe soul.” And where should these physical principles be found? Fuchs answers\nhis own question: in quantum _information_ theory.\n\n“The reason is simple, and I think\ninescapable,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1337417) he declares. “Quantum\nmechanics has always been about information; it is just that the physics\ncommunity has forgotten this.”\n\n![](images/00064.jpg)\n\nVISUAL AID BY CHRISTOPHER FUCHS [(Illustration credit\n13.1)](dummy_split_049.html#filepos1937281)\n\nOne who did not forget—or who rediscovered it—was John Archibald Wheeler,\npioneer of nuclear fission, student of Bohr and teacher of Feynman, namer of\nblack holes, the last giant of twentieth-century physics. Wheeler was given to\nepigrams and gnomic utterances. _A black hole has no hair_ was his famous way\nof stating that nothing but mass, charge, and spin can be perceived from\noutside. “It teaches us,” he wrote, “that space can be crumpled like a piece\nof paper into an infinitesimal dot, that time can be extinguished like a\nblown-out flame, and that the laws of physics that we regard as ‘sacred,’ as\nimmutable, are anything but.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1337591) In 1989\nhe offered his final catchphrase: _It from Bit_. His view was extreme. It was\nimmaterialist: information first, everything else later. “Otherwise\nput,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1337936) he said,\n\n> > every it—every particle, every field of force, even the space-time\n> continuum itself—derives its function, its meaning, its very existence …\n> from _bits_.\n\nWhy does nature appear quantized? Because information is quantized. The bit is\nthe ultimate unsplittable particle.\n\nAmong the physics phenomena that pushed information front and center, none\nwere more spectacular than black holes. At first, of course, they had not\nseemed to involve information at all.\n\nBlack holes were the brainchild of Einstein, though he did not live to know\nabout them. He established by 1915 that light must submit to the pull of\ngravity; that gravity curves the fabric of spacetime; and that a sufficient\nmass, compacted together, as in a dense star, would collapse utterly,\nintensifying its own gravity and contracting without limit. It took almost a\nhalf century more to face up to the consequences, because they are strange.\nAnything goes in, nothing comes out. At the center lies the singularity.\nDensity becomes infinite; gravity becomes infinite; spacetime curves\ninfinitely. Time and space are interchanged. Because no light, no signal of\nany kind, can escape the interior, such things are quintessentially invisible.\nWheeler began calling them “black holes” in 1967. Astronomers are sure they\nhave found some, by gravitational inference, and no one can ever know what is\ninside.\n\nAt first astrophysicists focused on matter and energy falling in. Later they\nbegan to worry about the information. A problem arose when Stephen Hawking,\nadding quantum effects to the usual calculations of general relativity, argued\nin 1974 that black holes should, after all, radiate particles—a consequence of\nquantum fluctuations near the event\nhorizon.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1338311) Black holes slowly evaporate,\nin other words. The problem was that Hawking radiation is featureless and\ndull. It is thermal radiation—heat. But matter falling _into_ the black hole\ncarries information, in its very structure, its organization, its quantum\nstates—in terms of statistical mechanics, its accessible microstates. As long\nas the missing information stayed out of reach beyond the event horizon,\nphysicists did not have to worry about it. They could say it was inaccessible\nbut not obliterated. “All colours will agree in the dark,” as Francis Bacon\nsaid in 1625.\n\nThe outbound Hawking radiation carries no information, however. If the black\nhole evaporates, where does the information go? According to quantum\nmechanics, information may never be destroyed. The deterministic laws of\nphysics require the states of a physical system at one instant to determine\nthe states at the next instant; in microscopic detail, the laws are\nreversible, and information must be preserved. Hawking was the first to state\nfirmly—even alarmingly—that this was a problem challenging the very\nfoundations of quantum mechanics. The loss of information would violate\nunitarity, the principle that probabilities must add up to one. “God not only\nplays dice, He sometimes throws the dice where they cannot be seen,” Hawking\nsaid. In the summer of 1975, he submitted a paper to the _Physical Review_\nwith a dramatic headline, “The Breakdown of Physics in Gravitational\nCollapse.” The journal held it for more than a year before publishing it with\na milder title.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1338603)\n\nAs Hawking expected, other physicists objected vehemently. Among them was John\nPreskill at the California Institute of Technology, who continued to believe\nin the principle that information cannot be lost: even when a book goes up in\nflames, in physicists’ terms, if you could track every photon and every\nfragment of ash, you should be able to integrate backward and reconstruct the\nbook. “Information loss is highly\ninfectious,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1339097) warned Preskill at a\nCaltech Theory Seminar. “It is very hard to modify quantum theory so as to\naccommodate a little bit of information loss without it leaking into all\nprocesses.” In 1997 he made a much-publicized wager with Hawking that the\ninformation must be escaping the black hole somehow. They bet an encyclopedia\nof the winner’s choice. “Some physicists feel the question of what happens in\na black hole is academic or even theological, like counting angels on\npinheads,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1339570) said Leonard Susskind of\nStanford, siding with Preskill. “But it is not so at all: at stake are the\nfuture rules of physics.” Over the next few years a cornucopia of solutions\nwas proposed. Hawking himself said at one point: “I think the information\nprobably goes off into another universe. I have not been able to show it yet\nmathematically.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1339866)\n\nIt was not until 2004 that Hawking, then sixty-two, reversed himself and\nconceded the bet. He announced that he had found a way to show that quantum\ngravity is unitary after all and that information is preserved. He applied a\nformalism of quantum indeterminacy—the “sum over histories” path integrals of\nRichard Feynman—to the very topology of spacetime and declared, in effect,\nthat black holes are never unambiguously black. “The confusion and paradox\narose because people thought classically in terms of a single topology for\nspace-time,” he wrote.* His new formulation struck some physicists as cloudy\nand left many questions unanswered, but he was firm on one point. “There is no\nbaby universe branching off, as I once\nthought,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1340224) he wrote. “The information\nremains firmly in our universe. I’m sorry to disappoint science fiction fans.”\nHe gave Preskill a copy of _Total Baseball: The Ultimate Baseball\nEncyclopedia_ , weighing in at 2,688 pages—“from which information can be\nrecovered with ease,” he said. “But maybe I should have just given him the\nashes.”\n\nCharles Bennett came to quantum information theory by a very different route.\nLong before he developed his idea of logical depth, he was thinking about the\n“thermodynamics of computation”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1340501)—a\npeculiar topic, because information processing was mostly treated as\ndisembodied. “The thermodynamics of computation, if anyone had stopped to\nwonder about it, would probably have seemed no more urgent as a topic of\nscientific inquiry than, say, the thermodynamics of love,” says Bennett. It is\nlike the energy of thought. Calories may be expended, but no one is counting.\n\nStranger still, Bennett tried investigating the thermodynamics of the least\nthermodynamic computer of all—the nonexistent, abstract, idealized Turing\nmachine. Turing himself never worried about his thought experiment consuming\nany energy or radiating any heat as it goes about its business of marching up\nand down imaginary paper tapes. Yet in the early 1980s Bennett was talking\nabout using Turing-machine tapes for fuel, their caloric content to be\nmeasured in bits. Still a thought experiment, of course, meant to focus on a\nvery real question: What is the physical cost of logical work? “Computers,” he\nwrote provocatively, “may be thought of as engines for transforming free\nenergy into waste heat and mathematical\nwork.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1340828) Entropy surfaced again. A tape\nfull of zeroes, or a tape encoding the works of Shakespeare, or a tape\nrehearsing the digits of Π, has “fuel value.” A random tape has none.\n\nBennett, the son of two music teachers, grew up in the Westchester suburbs of\nNew York; he studied chemistry at Brandeis and then Harvard in the 1960s.\nJames Watson was at Harvard then, teaching about the genetic code, and Bennett\nworked for him one year as a teaching assistant. He got his doctorate in\nmolecular dynamics, doing computer simulations that ran overnight on a machine\nwith a memory of about twenty thousand decimal digits and generated output on\npages and pages of fan-fold paper. Looking for more computing power to\ncontinue his molecular-motion research, he went to the Lawrence Livermore\nLaboratory in Berkeley, California, and Argonne National Laboratory in\nIllinois, and then joined IBM Research in 1972.\n\nIBM did not manufacture Turing machines, of course. But at some point it\ndawned on Bennett that a special-purpose Turing machine had already been found\nin nature: namely RNA polymerase. He had learned about polymerase directly\nfrom Watson; it is the enzyme that crawls along a gene—its “tape”—transcribing\nthe DNA. It steps left and right; its logical state changes according to the\nchemical information written in sequence; and its thermodynamic behavior can\nbe measured.\n\nIn the real world of 1970s computing, hardware had rapidly grown thousands of\ntimes more energy-efficient than during the early vacuum-tube era.\nNonetheless, electronic computers dissipate considerable energy in the form of\nwaste heat. The closer they come to their theoretical minimum of energy use,\nthe more urgently scientists want to know just what that theoretical minimum\nis. Von Neumann, working with his big computers, made a back-of-the-envelope\ncalculation as early as 1949, proposing an amount of heat that must be\ndissipated “per elementary act of information, that is per elementary decision\nof a two-way alternative and per elementary transmittal of one unit of\ninformation.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1341199) He based it on the\nmolecular work done in a model thermodynamic system by Maxwell’s demon, as\nreimagined by Leó Szilárd.* Von Neumann said the price is paid by every\nelementary act of information processing, every choice between two\nalternatives. By the 1970s this was generally accepted. But it was wrong.\n\nVon Neumann’s error was discovered by the scientist who became Bennett’s\nmentor at IBM, Rolf Landauer, an exile from Nazi\nGermany.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1341366) Landauer devoted his career to\nestablishing the physical basis of information. “Information Is Physical” was\nthe title of one famous paper, meant to remind the community that computation\nrequires physical objects and obeys the laws of physics. Lest anyone forget,\nhe titled a later essay—his last, it turned out—“Information Is Inevitably\nPhysical.” Whether a bit is a mark on a stone tablet or a hole in a punched\ncard or a particle with spin up or down, he insisted that it could not exist\nwithout _some_ embodiment. Landauer tried in 1961 to prove von Neumann’s\nformula for the cost of information processing and discovered that he could\nnot. On the contrary, it seemed that most logical operations have no entropy\ncost at all. When a bit flips from zero to one, or vice-versa, the information\nis preserved. The process is reversible. Entropy is unchanged; no heat needs\nto be dissipated. Only an irreversible operation, he argued, increases\nentropy.\n\nLandauer and Bennett were a double act: a straight and narrow old IBM type and\na scruffy hippie (in Bennett’s view,\nanyway).[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1341743) The younger man pursued\nLandauer’s principle by analyzing every kind of computer he could imagine,\nreal and abstract, from Turing machines and messenger RNA to “ballistic”\ncomputers, carrying signals via something like billiard balls. He confirmed\nthat a great deal of computation can be done with no energy cost at all. In\nevery case, Bennett found, heat dissipation occurs only when information is\n_erased_. Erasure is the irreversible logical operation. When the head on a\nTuring machine erases one square of the tape, or when an electronic computer\nclears a capacitor, a bit is lost, and _then_ heat must be dissipated. In\nSzilárd’s thought experiment, the demon does not incur an entropy cost when it\nobserves or chooses a molecule. The payback comes at the moment of clearing\nthe record, when the demon erases one observation to make room for the next.\n\nForgetting takes work.\n\n“You might say this is the revenge of information theory on quantum\nmechanics,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1342064) Bennett says. Sometimes a\nsuccessful idea in one field can impede progress in another. In this case the\nsuccessful idea was the uncertainty principle, which brought home the central\nrole played by the measurement process itself. One can no longer talk simply\nabout “looking” at a molecule; the observer needs to employ photons, and the\nphotons must be more energetic than the thermal background, and complications\nensue. In quantum mechanics the act of observation has consequences of its\nown, whether performed by a laboratory scientist or by Maxwell’s demon. Nature\nis sensitive to our experiments.\n\n“The quantum theory of radiation helped people come to the incorrect\nconclusion that computing had an irreducible thermodynamic cost per step,”\nBennett says. “In the other case, the success of Shannon’s theory of\ninformation processing led people to abstract away all of the physics from\ninformation processing and think of it as a totally mathematical thing.” As\ncommunications engineers and chip designers came closer and closer to atomic\nlevels, they worried increasingly about quantum limitations interfering with\ntheir clean, classical ability to distinguish zero and one states. But now\nthey looked again—and this, finally, is where quantum information science is\nborn. Bennett and others began to think differently: that quantum effects,\nrather than being a nuisance, might be turned to advantage.\n\nWedged like a hope chest against a wall of his office at IBM’s research\nlaboratory in the wooded hills of Westchester is a light-sealed device called\nAunt Martha (short for Aunt Martha’s coffin). Bennett and his research\nassistant John Smolin jury-rigged it in 1988 and 1989 with a little help from\nthe machine shop: an aluminum box spray-painted dull black on the inside and\nfurther sealed with rubber stoppers and black\nvelvet.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1342287) With a helium-neon laser for\nalignment and high-voltage cells to polarize the photons, they sent the first\nmessage ever to be encoded by quantum cryptography. It was a demonstration of\nan information-processing task that could be effectively accomplished only via\na quantum system. Quantum error correction, quantum teleportation, and quantum\ncomputers followed shortly behind.\n\nThe quantum message passed between Alice and Bob, a ubiquitous mythical pair.\nAlice and Bob got their start in cryptography, but the quantum people own them\nnow. Occasionally they are joined by Charlie. They are constantly walking into\ndifferent rooms and flipping quarters and sending each other sealed envelopes.\nThey choose states and perform Pauli rotations. “We say things such as ‘Alice\nsends Bob a qubit and forgets what she did,’ ‘Bob does a measurement and tells\nAlice,’”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1342607) explains Barbara Terhal, a\ncolleague of Bennett’s and one of the next generation of quantum information\ntheorists. Terhal herself has investigated whether Alice and Bob are\n_monogamous_ —another term of art, naturally.\n\nIn the Aunt Martha experiment, Alice sends information to Bob, encrypted so\nthat it cannot be read by a malevolent third party (Eve the eavesdropper). If\nthey both know their private key, Bob can decipher the message. But how is\nAlice to send Bob the key in the first place? Bennett and Gilles Brassard, a\ncomputer scientist in Montreal, began by encoding each bit of information as a\nsingle quantum object, such as a photon. The information resides in the\nphoton’s quantum states—for example, its horizontal or vertical polarization.\nWhereas an object in classical physics, typically composed of billions of\nparticles, can be intercepted, monitored, observed, and passed along, a\nquantum object cannot. Nor can it be copied or cloned. The act of observation\ninevitably disrupts the message. No matter how delicately eavesdroppers try to\nlisten in, they can be detected. Following an intricate and complex protocol\nworked out by Bennett and Brassard, Alice generates a sequence of random bits\nto use as the key, and Bob is able to establish an identical sequence at his\nend of the line.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1342957)\n\nThe first experiments with Aunt Martha’s coffin managed to send quantum bits\nacross thirty-two centimeters of free air. It was not _Mr. Watson, come here,\nI want to see you_ , but it was a first in the history of cryptography: an\nabsolutely unbreakable cryptographic key. Later experimenters moved on to\noptical fiber. Bennett, meanwhile, moved on to quantum teleportation.\n\nHe regretted that name soon enough, when the IBM marketing department featured\nhis work in an advertisement with the line “Stand by: I’ll teleport you some\ngoulash.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1343338) But the name stuck, because\nteleportation worked. Alice does not send goulash; she sends\nqubits.*[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1343760)\n\nThe qubit is the smallest nontrivial quantum system. Like a classical bit, a\nqubit has two possible values, zero or one—which is to say, two states that\ncan be reliably distinguished. In a classical system, _all_ states are\ndistinguishable in principle. (If you cannot tell one color from another, you\nmerely have an imperfect measuring device.) But in a quantum system, imperfect\ndistinguishability is everywhere, thanks to Heisenberg’s uncertainty\nprinciple. When you measure any property of a quantum object, you thereby lose\nthe ability to measure a complementary property. You can discover a particle’s\nmomentum or its position but not both. Other complementary properties include\ndirections of spin and, as in Aunt Martha’s coffin, polarization. Physicists\nthink of these quantum states in a geometrical way—the states of a system\ncorresponding to directions in space (a space of many possible dimensions),\nand their distinguishability depending on whether those directions are\nperpendicular (or “orthogonal”).\n\nThis imperfect distinguishability is what gives quantum physics its dreamlike\ncharacter: the inability to observe systems without disturbing them; the\ninability to clone quantum objects or broadcast them to many listeners. The\nqubit has this dreamlike character, too. It is not just either-or. Its 0 and 1\nvalues are represented by quantum states that can be reliably\ndistinguished—for example, horizontal and vertical polarizations—but\ncoexisting with these are the whole continuum of intermediate states, such as\ndiagonal polarizations, that lean toward 0 or 1 with different probabilities.\nSo a physicist says that a qubit is a _superposition_ of states; a combination\nof probability amplitudes. It is a determinate thing with a cloud of\nindeterminacy living inside. But the qubit is not a muddle; a superposition is\nnot a hodgepodge but a combining of probabilistic elements according to clear\nand elegant mathematical rules.\n\n“A nonrandom whole can have random parts,” says Bennett. “This is the most\ncounterintuitive part of quantum mechanics, yet it follows from the\nsuperposition principle and is the way nature works, as far as we know. People\nmay not like it at first, but after a while you get used to it, and the\nalternatives are far worse.”\n\nThe key to teleportation and to so much of the quantum information science\nthat followed is the phenomenon known as entanglement. Entanglement takes the\nsuperposition principle and extends it across space, to a pair of qubits far\napart from each other. They have a definite state _as a pair_ even while\nneither has a measurable state on its own. Before entanglement could be\ndiscovered, it had to be invented, in this case by Einstein. Then it had to be\nnamed, not by Einstein but by Schrödinger. Einstein invented it for a thought\nexperiment designed to illuminate what he considered flaws in quantum\nmechanics as it stood in 1935. He publicized it in a famous paper with Boris\nPodolsky and Nathan Rosen titled “Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of\nPhysical Reality Be Considered\nComplete?”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1344112) It was famous in part for\nprovoking Wolfgang Pauli to write to Werner Heisenberg, “Einstein has once\nagain expressed himself publicly on quantum mechanics.… As is well known, this\nis a catastrophe every time it\nhappens.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1344362) The thought experiment\nimagined a pair of particles correlated in a special way, as when, for\nexample, a pair of photons are emitted by a single atom. Their polarization is\nrandom but identical—now and as long as they last.\n\n![](images/00065.jpg)\n\nTHE QUBIT\n\nEinstein, Podolsky, and Rosen investigated what would happen when the photons\nare far apart and a measurement is performed on one of them. In the case of\nentangled particles—the pair of photons, created together and now light-years\napart—it seems that the measurement performed on one has an effect on the\nother. The instant Alice measures the vertical polarization of her photon,\nBob’s photon will also have a definite polarization state on that axis,\nwhereas its diagonal polarization will be indefinite. The measurement thus\ncreates an influence apparently traveling faster than light. It seemed a\nparadox, and Einstein abhorred it. “That which really exists in B should not\ndepend on what kind of measurement is carried out in space\nA,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1344720) he wrote. The paper concluded\nsternly, “No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit\nthis.” He gave it the indelible name _spukhafte Fernwirkung_ , “spooky action\nat a distance.”\n\nIn 2003 the Israeli physicist Asher Peres proposed one answer to the Einstein-\nPodolsky-Rosen (EPR) puzzle. The paper was not exactly wrong, he said, but it\nhad been written too soon: before Shannon published his theory of information,\n“and it took many more years before the latter was included in the physicist’s\ntoolbox.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1345023) Information is physical. It\nis no use talking about quantum states without considering the _information_\nabout the quantum states.\n\n> > Information is not just an abstract notion. It requires a physical\n> carrier, and the latter is (approximately) localized. After all, it was the\n> business of the Bell Telephone Company to transport information from one\n> telephone to another telephone, in a different location.\n>\n\n>> … When Alice measures her spin, the information she gets is localized at\nher position, and will remain so until she decides to broadcast it. Absolutely\nnothing happens at Bob’s location.… It is only if and when Alice informs Bob\nof the result she got (by mail, telephone, radio, or by means of any other\nmaterial carrier, which is naturally restricted to the speed of light) that\nBob realizes that his particle has a definite pure state.\n\nFor that matter, Christopher Fuchs argues that it is no use talking about\nquantum states at all. The quantum state is a construct of the observer—from\nwhich many troubles spring. Exit states; enter information. “Terminology can\nsay it all: A practitioner in this field, whether she has ever thought an\nounce about quantum foundations, is just as likely to say ‘quantum\ninformation’ as ‘quantum state’…‘What does the quantum teleportation protocol\ndo?’ A now completely standard answer would be: ‘It transfers quantum\ninformation from Alice’s site to Bob’s.’ What we have here is a change of\nmind-set.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1345304)\n\nThe puzzle of spooky action at a distance has not been altogether resolved.\n_Nonlocality_ has been demonstrated in a variety of clever experiments all\ndescended from the EPR thought experiment. Entanglement turns out to be not\nonly real but ubiquitous. The atom pair in every hydrogen molecule, H2, is\nquantumly entangled (_“verschränkt,”_ as Schrödinger said). Bennett put\nentanglement to work in quantum teleportation, presented publicly for the\nfirst time in 1993.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1345636) Teleportation uses\nan entangled pair to project quantum information from a third particle across\nan arbitrary distance. Alice cannot measure this third particle directly;\nrather, she measures something about its relation to one of the entangled\nparticles. Even though Alice herself remains ignorant about the original,\nbecause of the uncertainty principle, Bob is able to receive an exact replica.\nAlice’s object is disembodied in the process. Communication is not faster than\nlight, because Alice must also send Bob a classical (nonquantum) message on\nthe side. “The net result of teleportation is completely prosaic: the removal\nof [the quantum object] from Alice’s hands and its appearance in Bob’s hands a\nsuitable time later,” wrote Bennett and his colleagues. “The only remarkable\nfeature is that in the interim, the information has been cleanly separated\ninto classical and nonclassical parts.”\n\nResearchers quickly imagined many applications, such as transfer of volatile\ninformation into secure storage, or memory. With or without goulash,\nteleportation created excitement, because it opened up new possibilities for\nthe very real but still elusive dream of quantum computing.\n\nThe idea of a quantum computer is strange. Richard Feynman chose the\nstrangeness as his starting point in 1981, speaking at MIT, when he first\nexplored the possibility of using a quantum system to compute hard quantum\nproblems. He began with a supposedly naughty digression—“Secret! Secret! Close\nthe doors …”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1345984)\n\n> > We have always had a great deal of difficulty in understanding the world\n> view that quantum mechanics represents.

I cannot define the real\n> problem, therefore I suspect there’s no real problem, but I’m not sure\n> there’s no real problem.\n\nHe knew very well what the problem was for computation—for simulating quantum\nphysics with a computer. The problem was probability. Every quantum variable\ninvolved probabilities, and that made the difficulty of computation grow\nexponentially. “The number of information bits is the same as the number of\npoints in space, and therefore you’d have to have something like _N_ _N_\nconfigurations to be described to get the probability out, and that’s too big\nfor our computer to hold.… It is therefore impossible, according to the rules\nstated, to simulate by calculating the probability.”\n\nSo he proposed fighting fire with fire. “The other way to simulate a\nprobabilistic Nature, which I’ll call _N_ for the moment, might still be to\nsimulate the probabilistic Nature by a computer _C_ which itself is\nprobabilistic.” A quantum computer would not be a Turing machine, he said. It\nwould be something altogether new.\n\n“Feynman’s insight,” says Bennett, “was that a quantum system is, in a sense,\ncomputing its own future all the time. You may say it’s an analog computer of\nits own dynamics.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1346294) Researchers quickly\nrealized that if a quantum computer had special powers in cutting through\nproblems in simulating physics, it might be able to solve other types of\nintractable problems as well.\n\nThe power comes from that shimmering, untouchable object the qubit. The\nprobabilities are built in. Embodying a superposition of states gives the\nqubit more power than the classical bit, always in only one state or the\nother, zero or one, “a pretty miserable specimen of a two-dimensional\nvector,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1346511) as David Mermin says. “When we\nlearned to count on our sticky little classical fingers, we were misled,” Rolf\nLandauer said dryly. “We thought that an integer had to have a particular and\nunique value.” But no—not in the real world, which is to say the quantum\nworld.\n\nIn quantum computing, multiple qubits are entangled. Putting qubits at work\ntogether does not merely multiply their power; the power increases\nexponentially. In classical computing, where a bit is either-or, _n_ bits can\nencode any one of 2 _n_ values. Qubits can encode these Boolean values along\nwith all their possible superpositions. This gives a quantum computer a\npotential for parallel processing that has no classical equivalent. So quantum\ncomputers—in theory—can solve certain classes of problems that had otherwise\nbeen considered computationally infeasible.\n\nAn example is finding the prime factors of very large numbers. This happens to\nbe the key to cracking the most widespread cryptographic algorithms in use\ntoday, particularly RSA encryption.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1346739) The\nworld’s Internet commerce depends on it. In effect, the very large number is a\npublic key used to encrypt a message; if eavesdroppers can figure out its\nprime factors (also large), they can decipher the message. But whereas\nmultiplying a pair of large prime numbers is easy, the inverse is exceedingly\ndifficult. The procedure is an informational one-way street. So factoring RSA\nnumbers has been an ongoing challenge for classical computing. In December\n2009 a team distributed in Lausanne, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Paris, Bonn, and\nRedmond, Washington, used many hundreds of machines working almost two years\nto discover that\n![](images/00057.jpg)123![](images/00057.jpg)018![](images/00057.jpg)6684![](images/00057.jpg)5301![](images/00057.jpg)177![](images/00057.jpg)5513![](images/00057.jpg)0494![](images/00057.jpg)9583![](images/00057.jpg)84962![](images/00057.jpg)7207![](images/00057.jpg)7285![](images/00057.jpg)3569![](images/00057.jpg)5953![](images/00057.jpg)3479![](images/00057.jpg)2197![](images/00057.jpg)3224![](images/00057.jpg)5215![](images/00057.jpg)17264![](images/00057.jpg)0050![](images/00057.jpg)7263![](images/00057.jpg)6575![](images/00057.jpg)1874![](images/00057.jpg)5202![](images/00057.jpg)1997![](images/00057.jpg)8646![](images/00057.jpg)9389![](images/00057.jpg)9564![](images/00057.jpg)7494![](images/00057.jpg)2774![](images/00057.jpg)0638![](images/00057.jpg)4592![](images/00057.jpg)5192![](images/00057.jpg)5573![](images/00057.jpg)2630![](images/00057.jpg)3453![](images/00057.jpg)7315![](images/00057.jpg)4826![](images/00057.jpg)8507![](images/00057.jpg)9170![](images/00057.jpg)2612![](images/00057.jpg)2142![](images/00057.jpg)9134![](images/00057.jpg)6167![](images/00057.jpg)04292![](images/00057.jpg)1431![](images/00057.jpg)1602![](images/00057.jpg)2212![](images/00057.jpg)4047![](images/00057.jpg)9274![](images/00057.jpg)7377![](images/00057.jpg)9408![](images/00057.jpg)0665![](images/00057.jpg)3514![](images/00057.jpg)1959![](images/00057.jpg)7459![](images/00057.jpg)8569![](images/00057.jpg)0214![](images/00057.jpg)3413\nis the product of\n33![](images/00057.jpg)478![](images/00057.jpg)0716![](images/00057.jpg)9895![](images/00057.jpg)689![](images/00057.jpg)8786![](images/00057.jpg)0441![](images/00057.jpg)6984![](images/00057.jpg)8212![](images/00057.jpg)6908![](images/00057.jpg)1770![](images/00057.jpg)4794![](images/00057.jpg)9837![](images/00057.jpg)1376![](images/00057.jpg)8568![](images/00057.jpg)9124![](images/00057.jpg)3138![](images/00057.jpg)8982![](images/00057.jpg)8837![](images/00057.jpg)9387![](images/00057.jpg)8002![](images/00057.jpg)2876![](images/00057.jpg)1471![](images/00057.jpg)1652![](images/00057.jpg)5317![](images/00057.jpg)4308![](images/00057.jpg)7737![](images/00057.jpg)8144![](images/00057.jpg)6799![](images/00057.jpg)9489\nand\n36746![](images/00057.jpg)0436![](images/00057.jpg)6679![](images/00057.jpg)9590![](images/00057.jpg)4282![](images/00057.jpg)4463![](images/00057.jpg)3799![](images/00057.jpg)6279![](images/00057.jpg)5263![](images/00057.jpg)2279![](images/00057.jpg)1581![](images/00057.jpg)6434![](images/00057.jpg)3087![](images/00057.jpg)6426![](images/00057.jpg)7603![](images/00057.jpg)2283![](images/00057.jpg)81573![](images/00057.jpg)9666![](images/00057.jpg)5112![](images/00057.jpg)7923![](images/00057.jpg)33734![](images/00057.jpg)1714![](images/00057.jpg)33968![](images/00057.jpg)1027![](images/00057.jpg)0092![](images/00057.jpg)7987![](images/00057.jpg)3630![](images/00057.jpg)8917\\.\nThey estimated that the computation used more than 1020\noperations.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1346950)\n\nThis was one of the smaller RSA numbers, but, had the solution come earlier,\nthe team could have won a $50,000 prize offered by RSA Laboratories. As far as\nclassical computing is concerned, such encryption is considered quite secure.\nLarger numbers take exponentially longer time, and at some point the time\nexceeds the age of the universe.\n\nQuantum computing is another matter. The ability of a quantum computer to\noccupy many states at once opens new vistas. In 1994, before anyone knew how\nactually to build any sort of quantum computer, a mathematician at Bell Labs\nfigured out how to program one to solve the factoring problem. He was Peter\nShor, a problem-solving prodigy who made an early mark in math olympiads and\nprize competitions. His ingenious algorithm, which broke the field wide open,\nis known by him simply as the factoring algorithm, and by everyone else as\nShor’s algorithm. Two years later Lov Grover, also at Bell Labs, came up with\na quantum algorithm for searching a vast unsorted database. That is the\ncanonical hard problem for a world of limitless information—needles and\nhaystacks.\n\n“Quantum computers were basically a\nrevolution,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1347247) Dorit Aharonov of Hebrew\nUniversity told an audience in 2009. “The revolution was launched into the air\nby Shor’s algorithm. But the _reason_ for the revolution—other than the\namazing practical implications—is that they redefine what is an _easy_ and\nwhat is a _hard_ problem.”\n\nWhat gives quantum computers their power also makes them exceedingly difficult\nto work with. Extracting information from a system means observing it, and\nobserving a system means interfering with the quantum magic. Qubits cannot be\nwatched as they do their exponentially many operations in parallel; measuring\nthat shadow-mesh of possibilities reduces it to a classical bit. Quantum\ninformation is fragile. The only way to learn the result of a computation is\nto wait until after the quantum work is done.\n\nQuantum information is like a dream—evanescent, never quite existing as firmly\nas a word on a printed page. “Many people can read a book and get the same\nmessage,” Bennett says, “but trying to tell people about your dream changes\nyour memory of it, so that eventually you forget the dream and remember only\nwhat you said about it.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1347607) Quantum\nerasure, in turn, amounts to a true undoing: “One can fairly say that even God\nhas forgotten.”\n\nAs for Shannon himself, he was unable to witness this flowering of the seeds\nhe had planted. “If Shannon were around now, I would say he would be very\nenthusiastic about the entanglement-assisted capacity of a\nchannel,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1348034) says Bennett. “The same form,\na generalization of Shannon’s formula, covers both classic and quantum\nchannels in a very elegant way. So it’s pretty well established that the\nquantum generalization of classical information has led to a cleaner and more\npowerful theory, both of computing and communication.” Shannon lived till\n2001, his last years dimmed and isolated by the disease of erasure,\nAlzheimer’s. His life had spanned the twentieth century and helped to define\nit. As much as any one person, he was the progenitor of the information age.\nCyberspace is in part his creation; he never knew it, though he told his last\ninterviewer, in 1987, that he was investigating the idea of mirrored rooms:\n“to work out all the possible mirrored rooms that make sense, in that if you\nlooked everywhere from inside one, space would be divided into a bunch of\nrooms, and you would be in each room and this would go on to infinity without\ncontradiction.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1348253) He hoped to build a\ngallery of mirrors in his house near MIT, but he never did.\n\nIt was John Wheeler who left behind an agenda for quantum information\nscience—a modest to-do list for the next generation of physicists and computer\nscientists together:[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1348642)\n\n“Translate the quantum versions of string theory and of Einstein’s\ngeometrodynamics from the language of continuum to the language of bit,” he\nexhorted his heirs.\n\n“Survey one by one with an imaginative eye the powerful tools that\nmathematics—including mathematical logic—has won … and for each such technique\nwork out the transcription into the world of bits.”\n\nAnd, “From the wheels-upon-wheels-upon-wheels evolution of computer\nprogramming dig out, systematize and display every feature that illuminates\nthe level-upon-level-upon-level structure of physics.”\n\nAnd, “ _Finally_. Deplore? No, celebrate the absence of a clean clear\ndefinition of the term ‘bit’ as elementary unit in the establishment of\nmeaning.… If and when we learn how to combine bits in fantastically large\nnumbers to obtain what we call existence, we will know better what we mean\nboth by bit and by existence.”\n\nThis is the challenge that remains, and not just for scientists: the\nestablishment of meaning.\n\n* * *\n\n* “It was either R4 or a black hole. But the Feynman sum over histories allows it to be both at once.”\n\n* Von Neumann’s formula for the theoretical energy cost of every logical operation was _kT_ ln 2 joules per bit, where _T_ is the computer’s operating temperature and _k_ is the Boltzman constant. Szilárd had proved that the demon in his engine can get _kT_ ln 2 of work out of every molecule it selects, so that energy cost must be paid somewhere in the cycle.\n\n* This word is not universally accepted, though the OED recognized it as of December 2007. David Mermin wrote that same year: “Unfortunately the preposterous spelling qubit currently holds sway.… Although “qubit” honors the English (German, Italian,…) rule that q should be followed by u, it ignores the equally powerful requirement that qu should be followed by a vowel. My guess is that “qubit” has gained acceptance because it visually resembles an obsolete English unit of distance, the homonymic cubit. To see its ungainliness with fresh eyes, it suffices to imagine … that one erased transparencies and cleaned ones ears with Qutips.”\n\n\n# 14 | AFTER THE FLOOD\n\n\n##\n\n> (A Great Album of Babel)\n\n> _Suppose within every book there is another book, and within every letter on\n> every page another volume constantly unfolding; but these volumes take no\n> space on the desk.

This\nlibrary (which others call the universe) enshrines all the information. Yet no\nknowledge can be discovered there, precisely because all knowledge _is_ there,\nshelved side by side with all falsehood. In the mirrored galleries, on the\ncountless shelves, can be found everything and nothing. There can be no more\nperfect case of information glut.\n\nWe make our own storehouses. The persistence of information, the difficulty of\nforgetting, so characteristic of our time, accretes confusion. As the free,\namateur, collaborative online encyclopedia called Wikipedia began to overtake\nall the world’s printed encyclopedias in volume and comprehensiveness, the\neditors realized that too many names had multiple identities. They worked out\na disambiguation policy, which led to the creation of disambiguation pages—a\nhundred thousand and more. For example, a user foraging in Wikipedia’s\nlabyrinthine galleries for “Babel” finds “Babel (disambiguation),” which leads\nin turn to the Hebrew name for ancient Babylon, to the Tower of Babel, to an\nIraqi newspaper, a book by Patti Smith, a Soviet journalist, an Australian\nlanguage teachers’ journal, a film, a record label, an island in Australia,\ntwo different mountains in Canada, and “a neutrally aligned planet in the\nfictional Star Trek universe.” And more. The paths of disambiguation fork\nagain and again. For example, “Tower of Babel (disambiguation)” lists, besides\nthe story in the Old Testament, songs, games, books, a Brueghel painting, an\nEscher woodcut, and “the tarot card.” We have made many towers of Babel.\n\nLong before Wikipedia, Borges also wrote about the encyclopedia “fallaciously\ncalled _The Anglo-American Cyclopedia_ (New York, 1917),” a warren of fiction\nmingling with fact, another hall of mirrors and misprints, a compendium of\npure and impure information that projects its own world. That world is called\nTlön. “It is conjectured that this brave new world is the work of a secret\nsociety of astronomers, biologists, engineers, metaphysicians, poets,\nchemists, algebraists, moralists, painters,\ngeometers.…”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1349678) writes Borges. “This plan\nis so vast that each writer’s contribution is infinitesimal. At first it was\nbelieved that Tlön was a mere chaos, an irresponsible license of the\nimagination; now it is known that it is a cosmos.” With good reason, the\nArgentine master has been taken up as a prophet (“our heresiarch\nuncle,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1349960) William Gibson says) by another\ngeneration of writers in the age of information.\n\nLong before Borges, the imagination of Charles Babbage had conjured another\nlibrary of Babel. He found it in the very air: a record, scrambled yet\npermanent, of every human utterance.\n\n> > What a strange chaos is this wide atmosphere we breathe!… The air itself\n> is one vast library, on whose pages are for ever written all that man has\n> ever said or woman whispered. There, in their mutable but unerring\n> characters, mixed with the earliest, as well as the latest sighs of\n> mortality, stand for ever recorded, vows unredeemed, promises unfulfilled,\n> perpetuating in the united movements of each particle, the testimony of\n> man’s changeful will.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1350213)\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, following Babbage’s work eagerly, saw the point. “No thought\ncan perish,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1350489) he wrote in 1845, in a\ndialogue between two angels. “Did there not cross your mind some thought of\nthe _physical power of words_? Is not every word an impulse on the air?”\nFurther, every impulse vibrates outward indefinitely, “upward and onward in\ntheir influences upon all particles of all matter,” until it must, “ _in the\nend_ , impress every individual thing that exists _within the universe_.” Poe\nwas also reading Newton’s champion Pierre-Simon Laplace. “A being of infinite\nunderstanding,” wrote Poe, “—one to whom the _perfection_ of the algebraic\nanalysis lay unfolded” could trace the undulations backward to their source.\n\nBabbage and Poe took an information-theoretic view of the new physics. Laplace\nhad expounded a perfect Newtonian mechanical determinism; he went further than\nNewton himself, arguing for a clockwork universe in which nothing is left to\nchance. Since the laws of physics apply equally to the heavenly bodies and the\ntiniest particles, and since they operate with perfect reliability, then\nsurely (said Laplace) the state of the universe at every instant follows\ninexorably from the past and must lead just as relentlessly to the future. It\nwas too soon to conceive of quantum uncertainty, chaos theory, or the limits\nof computability. To dramatize his perfect determinism, Laplace asked us to\nimagine a being—an “intelligence”—capable of perfect knowledge:\n\n> > It would embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies\n> of the universe and those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing would be\n> uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present to its\n> eyes.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1350796)\n\nNothing else Laplace wrote ever became as famous as this thought experiment.\nIt rendered useless not only God’s will but Man’s. To scientists this extreme\nNewtonianism seemed cause for optimism. To Babbage, all nature suddenly\nresembled a vast calculating engine, a grand version of his own deterministic\nmachine: “In turning our views from these simple consequences of the\njuxtaposition of a few wheels, it is impossible not to perceive the parallel\nreasoning, as applied to the mighty and far more complex phenomena of\nnature.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1351133) Each atom, once disturbed,\nmust communicate its motion to others, and they in turn influence waves of\nair, and no impulse is ever entirely lost. The track of every canoe remains\nsomewhere in the oceans. Babbage, whose railroad pen recorder traced on a roll\nof paper the history of a journey, saw information, formerly evanescent, as a\nseries of physical impressions that were, or could be preserved. The\nphonograph, impressing sound into foil or wax, had yet to be invented, but\nBabbage could view the atmosphere as an engine of motion with meaning: “every\natom impressed with good and with ill … which philosophers and sages have\nimparted to it, mixed and combined in ten thousand ways with all that is\nworthless and base.” Every word ever said, whether heard by a hundred\nlisteners or none, far from having vanished into the air, leaves its indelible\nmark, the complete record of human utterance being encrypted by the laws of\nmotion and capable, in theory, of being recovered—given enough computing\npower.\n\nThis was overoptimistic. Still, the same year Babbage published his essay, the\nartist and chemist Louis Daguerre in Paris perfected his means of capturing\nvisual images on silver-coated plates. His English competitor, William Fox\nTalbot, called this “the art of photogenic drawing, or of forming pictures and\nimages of natural objects by means of solar\nlight.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1351359) Talbot saw something meme-like.\n“By means of this contrivance,” he wrote, “it is not the artist who makes the\npicture, but the picture which makes _itself_.” Now the images that fly before\nour eyes could be frozen, impressed upon substance, made permanent.\n\nBy painting or drawing, an artist—with skill, training, and long\nlabor—reconstructs what the eye might see. By contrast, a daguerreotype is in\nsome sense the thing itself—the information, stored, in an instant. It was\nunimaginable, but there it was. The possibilities made the mind reel. Once\nstorage began, where would it stop? An American essayist immediately connected\nphotography to Babbage’s atmospheric library of sounds: Babbage said that\nevery word was registered somewhere in the air, so perhaps every image, too,\nleft its permanent mark—somewhere.\n\n> > In fact, there is a great album of Babel. But what too, if the great\n> business of the sun be to act registrar likewise, and to give out\n> impressions of our looks, and pictures of our actions; and so … for all we\n> know to the contrary, other worlds may be peopled and conducted with the\n> images of persons and transactions thrown off from this and from each other;\n> the whole universal nature being nothing more than phonetic and photogenic\n> structures.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1351660)\n\nThe universe, which others called a library or an album, then came to resemble\na computer. Alan Turing may have noticed this first: observing that the\ncomputer, like the universe, is best seen as a collection of states, and the\nstate of the machine at any instant leads to the state at the next instant,\nand thus all the future of the machine should be predictable from its initial\nstate and its input signals.\n\nThe universe is computing its own destiny.\n\nTuring noticed that Laplace’s dream of perfection might be possible in a\nmachine but not in the universe, because of a phenomenon which, a generation\nlater, would be discovered by chaos theorists and named the butterfly effect.\nTuring described it this way in 1950:\n\n> > The system of the “universe as a whole” is such that quite small errors in\n> initial conditions can have an overwhelming effect at a later time. The\n> displacement of a single electron by a billionth of a centimetre at one\n> moment might make the difference between a man being killed by an avalanche\n> a year later, or escaping.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1351856)\n\nIf the universe is a computer, we may still struggle to access its memory. If\nit is a library, it is a library without shelves. When all the world’s sounds\ndisperse through the atmosphere, no word is left attached to any particular\nbunch of atoms. The words are anywhere and everywhere. That was why Babbage\ncalled this information store a “chaos.” Once again he was ahead of his time.\n\nWhen the ancients listed the Seven Wonders of the World, they included the\nLighthouse of Alexandria, a 400-foot stone tower built to aid sailors, but\noverlooked the library nearby. The library, amassing hundreds of thousands of\npapyrus rolls, maintained the greatest collection of knowledge on earth, then\nand for centuries to come. Beginning in the third century BCE, it served the\nPtolemies’ ambition to buy, steal, or copy all the writings of the known\nworld. The library enabled Alexandria to surpass Athens as an intellectual\ncenter. Its racks and cloisters held the dramas of Sophocles, Aeschylus, and\nEuripides; the mathematics of Euclid, Archimedes, and Eratosthenes; poetry,\nmedical texts, star charts, mystic writings—“such a blaze of knowledge and\ndiscovery,” H. G. Wells declared, “as the world was not to see again until the\nsixteenth century.… It is the true beginning of Modern\nHistory.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1352185) The lighthouse loomed large,\nbut the library was the real wonder. And then it burned.\n\nExactly when and how that happened, no one can ever know. Probably more than\nonce. Vengeful conquerors burn books as if the enemy’s souls reside there,\ntoo. “The Romans burnt the books of the Jews, of the Christians, and the\nphilosophers,” Isaac D’Israeli noted in the nineteenth century; “the Jews\nburnt the books of the Christians and the Pagans; and the Christians burnt the\nbooks of the Pagans and the Jews.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1352454) The\nQin dynasty burned China’s books in order to erase previous history. The\nerasure was effective, the written word being fragile. What we have of\nSophocles is not even a tenth of his plays. What we have of Aristotle is\nmostly second- or thirdhand. For historians peering into the past, the\ndestruction of the Great Library is an event horizon, a boundary across which\ninformation does not pass. Not even a partial catalogue survived the flames.\n\n“All the lost plays of the Athenians!”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1352731)\nwails Thomasina (a young mathematician who resembles Ada Byron) to her tutor,\nSeptimus, in Tom Stoppard’s drama _Arcadia_. “Thousands of poems—Aristotle’s\nown library … How can we sleep for grief?”\n\n“By counting our stock,” Septimus replies.\n\n> > You should no more grieve for the rest than for a buckle lost from your\n> first shoe, or for your lesson book which will be lost when you are old. We\n> shed as we pick up, like travelers who must carry everything in their arms,\n> and what we let fall will be picked up by those behind. The procession is\n> very long and life is very short. We die on the march. But there is nothing\n> outside the march so nothing can be lost to it. The missing plays of\n> Sophocles will turn up piece by piece, or be written again in another\n> language.\n\nAnyway, according to Borges, the missing plays can be found in the Library of\nBabel.\n\nIn honor of the lost library, Wikipedia drew hundreds of its editors to\nAlexandria in the eighth summer of its existence—people called Shipmaster,\nBrassratgirl, Notafish, and Jimbo who ordinarily meet only online. More than 7\nmillion such user names had been registered by then; the pilgrims came from\nforty-five countries, paying their own way, toting laptops, exchanging\ntradecraft, wearing their fervor on their T-shirts. By then, July 2008,\nWikipedia comprised 2.5 million articles in English, more than all the world’s\npaper encyclopedias combined, and a total of 11 million in 264 languages,\nincluding Wolof, Twi, and Dutch Low Saxon, but not including Choctaw, closed\nby community vote after achieving only fifteen articles, or Klingon, found to\nbe a “constructed,” if not precisely fictional, language. The Wikipedians\nconsider themselves as the Great Library’s heirs, their mission the gathering\nof all recorded knowledge. They do not, however, collect and preserve existing\ntexts. They attempt to summarize shared knowledge, apart from and outside of\nthe individuals who might have thought it was theirs.\n\nLike the imaginary library of Borges, Wikipedia begins to appear boundless.\nSeveral dozen of the non-English Wikipedias have, each, one article on\nPokémon, the trading-card game, manga series, and media franchise. The English\nWikipedia began with one article and then a jungle grew. There is a page for\n“Pokémon (disambiguation),” needed, among other reasons, in case anyone is\nlooking for the Zbtb7 oncogene, which was called Pokemon (for POK erythroid\nmyeloid ontogenic factor), until Nintendo’s trademark lawyers threatened to\nsue. There are at least five major articles about the popular-culture\nPokémons, and these spawn secondary and side articles, about the Pokémon\nregions, items, television episodes, game tactics, and all 493 creatures,\nheroes, protagonists, rivals, companions, and clones, from Bulbasaur to\nArceus. All are carefully researched and edited for accuracy, to ensure that\nthey are reliable and true to the Pokémon universe, which does not actually,\nin some senses of the word, exist. Back in the real world, Wikipedia has, or\naspires to have, detailed entries describing the routes, intersections, and\nhistories of every numbered highway and road in the United States. (“Route 273\n[New York State, decommissioned in 1980] began at an intersection with U.S.\nRoute 4 in Whitehall. After the intersection, the route passed the Our Lady of\nAngels Cemetery, where it turned to the southeast. Route 273 ran along the\nbase of Ore Red Hill, outside of Whitehall. Near Ore Red Hill, the highway\nintersected with a local road, which connected to US 4.”) There are pages for\nevery known enzyme and human gene. The _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ never\naspired to such breadth. How could it, being made of paper?\n\nAlone among the great enterprises of the early Internet, Wikipedia was not a\nbusiness; made no money, only lost money. It was supported by a nonprofit\ncharity established for the purpose. By the time the encyclopedia had 50\nmillion users daily, the foundation had a payroll of eighteen people,\nincluding one in Germany, one in the Netherlands, one in Australia, and one\nlawyer, and everyone else was a volunteer: the millions of contributors, the\nthousand or more designated “administrators,” and, always a looming presence,\nthe founder and self-described “spiritual leader,” Jimmy Wales. Wales did not\nplan initially the scrappy, chaotic, dilettantish, amateurish, upstart free-\nfor-all that Wikipedia quickly became. The would-be encyclopedia began with a\nroster of experts, academic credentials, verification, and peer review. But\nthe wiki idea took over, willy-nilly. A “wiki,” from a Hawaiian word for\n“quick,” was a web site that could be not just viewed but edited, by anyone. A\nwiki was therefore self-created, or at least self-sustaining.\n\nWikipedia first appeared to Internet users with a simple self-description:\n\n> > _HomePage_\n>\n\n>> _You can edit this page right now! It’s a free, community project_\n\n>\n\n>> _Welcome to Wikipedia! We’re writing a complete encyclopedia from scratch,\ncollaboratively. We started work in January 2001. We’ve got over 3,000 pages\nalready. We want to make over 100,000. So, let’s get to work! Write a little\n(or a lot) about what you know! Read our welcome message here: Welcome,\nnewcomers!_\n\nThe sparseness of the coverage that first year could be gauged by the list of\nrequested articles. Under the heading of Religion:\n“Catholicism?—Satan?—Zoroaster?—Mythology?” Under Technology: “internal\ncombustion engine?—dirigible?—liquid crystal display?—bandwidth?” Under\nFolklore: “(If you want to write about folklore, please come up with a list of\nfolklore topics that are actually recognized as distinct, significant topics\nin folklore, a subject that you are not likely to know much about if all\nyou’ve done along these lines is play Dungeons and Dragons,\nq.v.).”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1352978) Dungeons and Dragons was\nalready well covered. Wikipedia was not looking for flotsam and jetsam but did\nnot scorn them. Years later, in Alexandria, Jimmy Wales said: “All those\npeople who are obsessively writing about Britney Spears or the Simpsons or\nPokémon—it’s just not true that we should try to redirect them into writing\nabout obscure concepts in physics. Wiki is not paper, and their time is not\nowned by us. We can’t say, ‘Why do we have these employees doing stuff that’s\nso useless?’ They’re not hurting anything. Let them write it.”\n\n“Wiki is not paper” was the unofficial motto. Self-referentially, the phrase\nhas its own encyclopedia page (see also “ _Wiki ist kein Papier_ ” and “\n_Wikipédia n’est pas sur papier_ ”). It means there is no physical or economic\nlimit on the number or the length of articles. Bits are free. “Any kind of\nmetaphor around paper or space is dead,” as Wales said.\n\nWikipedia found itself a mainstay of the culture with unexpected speed, in\npart because of its unplanned synergistic relationship with Google. It became\na test case for ideas of crowd intelligence: users endlessly debated the\nreliability—in theory and in actuality—of articles written in an authoritative\ntone by people with no credentials, no verifiable identity, and unknown\nprejudices. Wikipedia was notoriously subject to vandalism. It exposed the\ndifficulties—perhaps the impossibility—of reaching a neutral, consensus view\nof disputed, tumultuous reality. The process was plagued by so-called edit\nwars, when battling contributors reversed one another’s alterations without\nsurcease. At the end of 2006, people concerned with the “Cat” article could\nnot agree on whether a human with a cat is its “owner,” “caregiver,” or “human\ncompanion.” Over a three-week period, the argument extended to the length of a\nsmall book. There were edit wars over commas and edit wars over gods, futile\nwars over spelling and pronunciation and geopolitical disputes. Other edit\nwars exposed the malleability of words. Was the Conch Republic (Key West,\nFlorida) a “micronation”? Was a particular photograph of a young polar bear\n“cute”? Experts differed, and everyone was an expert.\n\nAfter the occasional turmoil, articles tend to settle toward permanence;\nstill, if the project seems to approach a kind of equilibrium, it is\nnonetheless dynamic and unstable. In the Wikipedia universe, reality cannot be\npinned down with finality. That idea was an illusion fostered in part by the\nsolidity of a leather-and-paper encyclopedia. Denis Diderot aimed in the\n_Encyclopédie_ , published in Paris beginning in 1751, “to collect all the\nknowledge that now lies scattered over the face of the earth, to make known\nits general structure to the men with whom we live, and to transmit it to\nthose who will come after us.” The _Britannica_ , first produced in Edinburgh\nin 1768 in one hundred weekly installments, sixpence apiece, wears the same\nhalo of authority. It seemed finished—in every edition. It has no equivalent\nin any other language. Even so, the experts responsible for the third edition\n(“in Eighteen Volumes, Greatly Improved”), a full century after Isaac Newton’s\n_Principia_ , could not bring themselves to endorse his, or any, theory of\ngravity, or gravitation. “There have been great disputes,” the _Britannica_\nstated.\n\n> > Many eminent philosophers, and among the rest Sir Isaac Newton himself,\n> have considered it as the first of all second causes; an incorporeal or\n> spiritual substance, which never can be perceived any other way than by its\n> effects; an universal property of matter, &c. Others have attempted to\n> explain the phenomena of gravitation by the action of a very subtile\n> etherial fluid; and to this explanation Sir Isaac, in the latter part of his\n> life, seems not to have been averse. He hath even given a conjecture\n> concerning the matter in which this fluid might occasion these phenomena.\n> But for a full account of … the state of the dispute at present, see the\n> articles, Newtonian Philosophy, Astronomy, Atmosphere, Earth, Electricity,\n> Fire, Light, Attraction, Repulsion, Plenum, Vacuum, &c.\n\nAs the _Britannica_ was authoritative, Newton’s theory of gravitation was not\nyet knowledge.\n\nWikipedia disclaims this sort of authority. Academic institutions officially\ndistrust it. Journalists are ordered not to rely upon it. Yet the authority\ncomes. If one wants to know how many American states contain a county named\nMontgomery, who will disbelieve the tally of eighteen in Wikipedia? Where else\ncould one look for a statistic so obscure—generated by a summing of the\nknowledge of hundreds or thousands of people, each of whom may know of only\none particular Montgomery County? Wikipedia features a popular article called\n“Errors in the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ that have been corrected in\nWikipedia.” This article is, of course, always in flux. All Wikipedia is. At\nany moment the reader is catching a version of truth on the wing.\n\nWhen Wikipedia states, in the article “Aging,”\n\n> > After a period of near perfect renewal (in humans, between 20 and 35 years\n> of age [citation needed]), organismal senescence is characterized by the\n> declining ability to respond to stress, increasing homeostatic imbalance and\n> increased risk of disease. This irreversible series of changes inevitably\n> ends in death,\n\na reader may trust this; yet for one minute in the early morning of December\n20, 2007, the entire article comprised instead a single sentence: “Aging is\nwhat you get when you get freakin old old\nold.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1353460) Such obvious vandalism lasts\nhardly any time at all. Detecting it and reversing it are automated vandalbots\nand legions of human vandal fighters, many of them proud members of the\nCounter-Vandalism Unit and Task Force. According to a popular saying that\noriginated with a frustrated vandal, “On Wikipedia, there is a giant\nconspiracy attempting to have articles agree with reality.” This is about\nright. A conspiracy is all the Wikipedians can hope for, and often it is\nenough.\n\nLewis Carroll, near the end of the nineteenth century, described in fiction\nthe ultimate map, representing the world on a unitary scale, a mile to a mile:\n“It has never been spread out, yet. The farmers objected: they said it would\ncover the whole country, and shut out the\nsunlight.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1353859) The point is not lost on\nWikipedians. Some are familiar with a debate carried out by the German branch\nabout the screw on the left rear brake pad of Ulrich Fuchs’s bicycle. Fuchs,\nas a Wikipedia editor, proposed the question, Does this item in the universe\nof objects merit its own Wikipedia entry? The screw was agreed to be small but\nreal and specifiable. “This is an object in space, and I’ve seen\nit,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1354120) said Jimmy Wales. Indeed, an\narticle appeared in the German Meta-Wiki (that is, the Wikipedia _about_\nWikipedia) titled “ _Die Schraube an der hinteren linken Bremsbacke am Fahrrad\nvon Ulrich Fuchs_.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1354354) As Wales noted, the\nvery existence of this article was “a meta-irony.” It was written by the very\npeople who were arguing against its suitability. The article was not really\nabout the screw, however. It is about a controversy: whether Wikipedia should\nstrive, in theory or in practice, to describe the whole world in all its\ndetail.\n\nOpposing factions coalesced around the labels “deletionism” and\n“inclusionism.” Inclusionists take the broadest view of what belongs in\nWikipedia. Deletionists argue for, and often perform, the removal of trivia:\narticles too short or poorly written or unreliable, on topics lacking\nnotability. All these criteria are understood to be variable and subjective.\nDeletionists want to raise the bar of quality. In 2008 they succeeded in\nremoving an entry on the Port Macquarie Presbyterian Church, New South Wales,\nAustralia, on grounds of non-notability. Jimmy Wales himself leaned toward\ninclusionism. In the late summer of 2007, he visited Cape Town, South Africa,\nate lunch at a place called Mzoli’s, and created a “stub” with a single\nsentence: “Mzoli’s Meats is a butcher shop and restuarant located in Guguletu\ntownship near Cape Town, South Africa.” It survived for twenty-two minutes\nbefore a nineteen-year-old administrator called ^demon deleted it on grounds\nof insignificance. An hour later, another user re-created the article and\nexpanded it based on information from a local Cape Town blog and a radio\ninterview transcribed online. Two minutes passed, and yet another user\nobjected on grounds that “this article or section is written like an\nadvertisement.” And so on. The word “famous” was inserted and deleted several\ntimes. The user ^demon weighed in again, saying, “We are not the white pages\nand we are not a travel guide.” The user EVula retorted, “I think if we give\nthis article a bit more than a couple of hours of existence, we might have\nsomething worthwhile.” Soon the dispute attracted newspaper coverage in\nAustralia and England. By the next year, the article had not only survived but\nhad grown to include a photograph, an exact latitude and longitude, a list of\nfourteen references, and separate sections for History, Business, and Tourism.\nSome hard feelings evidently remained, for in March 2008 an anonymous user\nreplaced the entire article with one sentence: “Mzoli’s is an insignificant\nlittle restaurant whose article only exists here because Jimmy Wales is a\nbumbling egomaniac.” That lasted less than a minute.\n\nWikipedia evolves dendritically, sending off new shoots in many directions.\n(In this it resembles the universe.) So deletionism and inclusionism spawn\nmergism and incrementalism. They lead to factionalism, and the factions\nfission into Associations of Deletionist Wikipedians and Inclusionist\nWikipedians side by side with the Association of Wikipedians Who Dislike\nMaking Broad Judgments About the Worthiness of a General Category of Article,\nand Who Are in Favor of the Deletion of Some Particularly Bad Articles, but\nThat Doesn’t Mean They Are Deletionists. Wales worried particularly about\nBiographies of Living Persons. In an ideal world, where Wikipedia could be\nfreed from practical concerns of maintenance and reliability, Wales said he\nwould be happy to see a biography of every human on the planet. It outdoes\nBorges.\n\nEven then, at the impossible extreme—every person, every bicycle screw—the\ncollection would possess nothing like All Knowledge. For encyclopedias,\ninformation tends to come in the form of topics and categories. _Britannica_\nframed its organization in 1790 as “a plan entirely\nnew.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1354869) It advertised “the different\nsciences and arts” arranged as “distinct Treatises or Systems”—\n\n> And _full Explanations given_ of the\n>\n> Various Detached Parts of Knowledge, whether relating to Natural and\n> Artificial Objects, or to Matters Ecclesiastical, Civil, Military,\n> Commercial, &c.\n\nIn Wikipedia the detached parts of knowledge tend to keep splitting. The\neditors analyzed the logical dynamics as Aristotle or Boole might have:\n\n> > Many topics are based on the relationship of _factor X_ to _factor Y_ ,\n> resulting in one or more full articles. This could refer to, for example,\n> _situation X_ in _location Y_ , or _version X_ of _item Y_. This is\n> perfectly valid when the two variables put together represent some\n> culturally significant phenomenon or some otherwise notable interest. Often,\n> separate articles are needed for a subject within a range of different\n> countries due to its substantial differences across international borders.\n> Articles like Slate industry in Wales and Island Fox are fitting examples.\n> But writing about Oak trees in North Carolina or a Blue truck would likely\n> constitute a POV fork, original research, or would otherwise be outright\n> silly.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1355248)\n\nCharles Dickens had earlier considered this very problem. In _The Pickwick\nPapers_ , a man is said to have read up in the _Britannica_ on Chinese\nmetaphysics. There was, however, no such article: “He read for metaphysics\nunder the letter M, and for China under the letter C, and combined his\ninformation.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1355646)\n\nIn 2008 the novelist Nicholson Baker, calling himself Wageless, got sucked\ninto Wikipedia like so many others, first seeking information and then\ntentatively supplying some, beginning one Friday evening with the article on\nbovine somatotropin and, the next day, _Sleepless in Seattle_ , periodization,\nand hydraulic fluid. On Sunday it was pornochanchada (Brazilian sex films), a\nfootball player of the 1950s called Earl Blair, and back to hydraulic fluid.\nOn Tuesday he discovered the Article Rescue Squadron, dedicated to finding\narticles in danger of deletion and saving them by making them better instead.\nBaker immediately signed up, typing a note: “I want to be a part of this.” His\ndescent into obsession is documented in the archives, like everything else\nthat happens on Wikipedia, and he wrote about it a few months later in a print\npublication, _The New York Review of Books_.\n\n> > I began standing with my computer open on the kitchen counter, staring at\n> my growing watchlist, checking, peeking.… I stopped hearing what my family\n> was saying to me—for about two weeks I all but disappeared into my screen,\n> trying to salvage brief, sometimes overly promotional but nevertheless\n> worthy biographies by recasting them in neutral language, and by hastily\n> scouring newspaper databases and Google Books for references that would bulk\n> up their notability quotient. I had become an\n> “inclusionist.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1355873)\n\nHe concluded with a “secret hope”: that all the flotsam and jetsam could be\nsaved, if not in Wikipedia than in “a Wikimorgue—a bin of broken dreams.” He\nsuggested calling it Deletopedia. “It would have much to tell us over time.”\nOn the principle that nothing online ever perishes, Deletionpedia was created\nshortly thereafter, and it has grown by degrees. The Port Macquarie\nPresbyterian Church lives on there, though it is not, strictly speaking, part\nof the encyclopedia. Which some call the universe.\n\nNames became a special problem: their disambiguation; their complexity; their\ncollisions. The nearly limitless flow of information had the effect of\nthrowing all the world’s items into a single arena, where they seemed to play\na frantic game of Bumper Car. Simpler times had allowed simpler naming: “The\nLord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and\nbrought them unto Adam to see what he would call them,” says Genesis; “and\nwhatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.” For\neach creature one name; for each name one creature. Soon, however, Adam had\nhelp.\n\nIn his novel _The Infinities_ , John Banville imagines the god Hermes saying:\n“A hamadryad is a wood-nymph, also a poisonous snake in India, and an\nAbyssinian baboon. It takes a god to know a thing like\nthat.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1356114) Yet according to Wikipedia,\n_hamadryad_ also names a butterfly, a natural history journal from India, and\na Canadian progressive rock band. Are we all now as gods? The rock band and\nthe wood nymph could coexist without friction, but more generally the breaking\ndown of information barriers leads to conflict over names and naming rights.\nImpossible as it seems, the modern world is running out of names. The roster\nof possibilities seems infinite, but the demand is even greater.\n\nThe major telegraph companies, struggling in 1919 with the growing problem of\nmisdirected messages, established a Central Bureau for Registered Addresses.\nIts central office in the financial district of New York filled an upstairs\nroom on Broad Street with steel filing cabinets. Customers were invited to\nregister code names for their addresses: single words of five to ten letters,\nrequired to be “pronounceable”—that is, “made up of syllables that appear in\none of eight European languages.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1356355) Many\ncustomers complained about the yearly charge—$2.50 per code name—but by 1934\nthe bureau was managing a list of 28,000, including ILLUMINATE (the New York\nEdison Company), TOOTSWEETS (the Sweet Company of America), and CHERRYTREE\n(George Washington Hotel).[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1356629) The\nfinancier Bernard M. Baruch managed to get BARUCH all to himself. It was first\ncome, first served, and it was a modest harbinger of things to come.\n\nCyberspace, of course, changes everything. A South Carolina company called Fox\n& Hound Realty, Billy Benton owner/broker, registered the domain name\nBARUCH.COM. A Canadian living in High Prairie, Alberta, registered\nJRRTOLKIEN.COM and held on to it for a decade, until a panel of the World\nIntellectual Property Organization in Geneva took it away from him. The name\nhad value; others who claimed an interest in it, as a brand and a trademark,\neither registered or unregistered, included the late writer’s heirs,\npublisher, and filmmakers, not to mention the several thousand people\nworldwide who happened to share his surname. The same High Prairie man was\nbasing a business on his possession of famous names: Céline Dion, Albert\nEinstein, Michael Crichton, Pierce Brosnan, and about 1,500 more. Some of\nthese people fought back. A select few names—the pinnacles and hilltops—have\ndeveloped a tremendous concentration of economic value. The word _Nike_ is\nthought by economists to be worth $7 billion; _Coca-Cola_ is valued at ten\ntimes more.\n\nIn the study of onomastics it is axiomatic that growing social units lead to\ngrowing name systems. For life in tribes and villages, single names like Albin\nand Ava were enough, but tribes gave way to clans, cities to nations, and\npeople had to do better: surnames and patronyms; names based on geography and\noccupation. More complex societies demand more complex names. The Internet\nrepresents not just a new opportunity for fights over names but a leap in\nscale causing a phase transition.\n\nAn Atlanta music writer known as Bill Wyman received a cease-and-desist letter\nfrom lawyers representing the former Rolling Stone bass player also known as\nBill Wyman; demanding, that is, that he “cease and desist” using his name. In\nresponding, the first Bill Wyman pointed out that the second Bill Wyman had\nbeen born William George Perks. The car company known in Germany as Dr. Ing.\nh.c. F. Porsche AG fought a series of battles to protect the name Carrera.\nAnother contender was the Swiss village, postal code 7122. “The village\nCarrera existed prior to the Porsche trademark,” Christoph Reuss of\nSwitzerland wrote to Porsche’s lawyers. “Porsche’s use of that name\nconstitutes a misappropriation of the goodwill and reputation developed by the\nvillagers of Carrera.” He added for good measure, “The village emits much less\nnoise and pollution than Porsche Carrera.” He did not mention that José\nCarreras, the opera singer, was embroiled in a name dispute of his own. The\ncar company, meanwhile, also claimed trademark ownership of the numerals 911.\n\nA useful term of art emerged from computer science: _namespace_ , a realm\nwithin which all names are distinct and unique. The world has long had\nnamespaces based on geography and other namespaces based on economic niche.\nYou could be Bloomingdale’s as long as you stayed out of New York; you could\nbe Ford if you did not make automobiles. The world’s rock bands constitute a\nnamespace, where Pretty Boy Floyd and Pink Floyd and Pink coexist, along with\nthe 13th Floor Elevators and the 99th Floor Elevators and Hamadryad. Finding\nnew names in this space becomes a challenge. The singer and songwriter long\ncalled simply “Prince” was given that name at birth; when he tired of it, he\nfound himself tagged with a meta-name, “the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.”\nThe Screen Actors Guild maintains a formal namespace of its own—only one Julia\nRoberts allowed. Traditional namespaces are overlapping and melting together.\nAnd many grow overcrowded.\n\nPharmaceutical names are a special case: a subindustry has emerged to coin\nthem, research them, and vet them. In the United States, the Food and Drug\nAdministration reviews proposed drug names for possible collisions, and this\nprocess is complex and uncertain. Mistakes cause death. Methadone, for opiate\ndependence, has been administered in place of Metadate, for attention-deficit\ndisorder, and Taxol, a cancer drug, for Taxotere, a different cancer drug,\nwith fatal results. Doctors fear both look-alike errors and sound-alike\nerrors: Zantac/Xanax; Verelan/Virilon. Linguists devise scientific measures of\nthe “distance” between names. But Lamictal and Lamisil and Ludiomil and\nLomotil are all approved drug names.\n\nIn the corporate namespace, signs of overcrowding could be seen in the fading\naway of what might be called simple, meaningful names. No new company could be\ncalled anything like General Electric or First National Bank or International\nBusiness Machines. Similarly, A.1. Steak Sauce could only refer to a food\nproduct with a long history. Millions of company names exist, and vast sums of\nmoney go to professional consultants in the business of creating more. It is\nno coincidence that the spectacular naming triumphs of cyberspace verge on\nnonsense: Yahoo!, Google, Twitter.\n\nThe Internet is not just a churner of namespaces; it is also a namespace of\nits own. Navigation around the globe’s computer networks relies on the special\nsystem of domain names, like COCA-COLA.COM. These names are actually\naddresses, in the modern sense of that word: “a register, location, or a\ndevice where information is stored.” The text encodes numbers; the numbers\npoint to places in cyberspace, branching down networks, subnetworks, and\ndevices. Although they are code, these brief text fragments also carry the\ngreat weight of meaning in the most vast of namespaces. They blend together\nfeatures of trademarks, vanity license plates, postal codes, radio-station\ncall letters, and graffiti. Like the telegraph code names, anyone could\nregister a domain name, for a small fee, beginning in 1993. It was first come,\nfirst served. The demand exceeds the supply.\n\nToo much work for short words. Many entities own “apple” trademarks, but there\nis only one APPLE.COM; when the domains of music and computing collided, so\ndid the Beatles and the computer company. There is only one MCDONALDS.COM, and\na journalist named Joshua Quittner registered it first. Much as the fashion\nempire of Giorgio Armani wanted ARMANI.COM, so did Anand Ramnath Mani of\nVancouver, and he got there first. Naturally a secondary market emerged for\ntrade in domain names. In 2006, one entrepreneur paid another entrepreneur $14\nmillion for SEX.COM. By then nearly every word in every well-known language\nhad been registered; so had uncountable combinations of words and variations\nof words—more than 100 million. It is a new business for corporate lawyers. A\nteam working for DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart, Germany, managed to wrest back\nMERCEDESSHOP.COM, DRIVEAMERCEDES.COM, DODGEVIPER.COM, CRYSLER.COM,\nCHRISLER.COM, CHRYSTLER.COM, and CHRISTLER.COM.\n\nThe legal edifices of intellectual property were rattled. The response was a\nspecies of panic—a land grab in trademarks. As recently as 1980, the United\nStates registered about ten thousand a year. Three decades later, the number\napproached three hundred thousand, jumping every year. The vast majority of\ntrademark applications used to be rejected; now the opposite is true. All the\nwords of the language, in all possible combinations, seem eligible for\nprotection by governments. A typical batch of early twenty-first century\nUnited States trademarks: GREEN CIRCLE, DESERT ISLAND, MY STUDENT BODY, ENJOY\nA PARTY IN EVERY BOWL!, TECHNOLIFT, MEETINGS IDEAS, TAMPER PROOF KEY RINGS,\nTHE BEST FROM THE WEST, AWESOME ACTIVITIES.\n\nThe collision of names, the exhaustion of names—it has happened before, if\nnever on this scale. Ancient naturalists knew perhaps five hundred different\nplants and, of course, gave each a name. Through the fifteenth century, that\nis as many as anyone knew. Then, in Europe, as printed books began to spread\nwith lists and drawings, an organized, collective knowledge came into being,\nand with it, as the historian Brian Ogilvie has shown, the discipline called\nnatural history.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1356866) The first botanists\ndiscovered a profusion of names. Caspar Ratzenberger, a student at Wittenberg\nin the 1550s, assembled a herbarium and tried to keep track: for one species\nhe noted eleven names in Latin and German: _Scandix, Pecten veneris, Herba\nscanaria, Cerefolium aculeatum, Nadelkrautt, Hechelkam, NadelKoerffel,\nVenusstrahl, Nadel Moehren, Schnabel\nMoehren,Schnabelkoerffel_.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1357173) In England\nit would have been called _shepherd’s needle_ or _shepherd’s comb_. Soon\nenough the profusion of species overtook the profusion of names. Naturalists\nformed a community; they corresponded, and they traveled. By the end of the\ncentury a Swiss botanist had published a catalogue of 6,000\nplants.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1357362) Every naturalist who discovered\na new one had the privilege and the responsibility of naming it; a\nproliferation of adjectives and compounds was inevitable, as were duplication\nand redundancy. To _shepherd’s needle_ and _shepherd’s comb_ were added, in\nEnglish alone, _shepherd’s bag, shepherd’s purse, shepherd’s beard, shepherd’s\nbedstraw, shepherd’s bodkin, shepherd’s cress, shepherd’s hour-glass,\nshepherd’s rod, shepherd’s gourd, shepherd’s joy, shepherd’s knot, shepherd’s\nmyrtle, shepherd’s peddler, shepherd’s pouche, shepherd’s staff, shepherd’s\nteasel, shepherd’s scrip_ , and _shepherd’s delight_.\n\nCarl Linnaeus had yet to invent taxonomy; when he did, in the eighteenth\ncentury, he had 7,700 species of plants to name, along with 4,400 animals. Now\nthere are about 300,000, not counting insects, which add millions more.\nScientists still try to name them all: there are beetle species named after\nBarack Obama, Darth Vader, and Roy Orbison. Frank Zappa has lent his name to a\nspider, a fish, and a jellyfish.\n\n“The name of a man is like his shadow,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1357543)\nsaid the Viennese onomatologist Ernst Pulgram in 1954. “It is not of his\nsubstance and not of his soul, but it lives with him and by him. Its presence\nis not vital, nor its absence fatal.” Those were simpler times.\n\nWhen Claude Shannon took a sheet of paper and penciled his outline of the\nmeasures of information in 1949, the scale went from tens of bits to hundreds\nto thousands, millions, billions, and trillions. The transistor was one year\nold and Moore’s law yet to be conceived. The top of the pyramid was Shannon’s\nestimate for the Library of Congress—one hundred trillion bits, 1014. He was\nabout right, but the pyramid was growing.\n\nAfter bits came kilobits, naturally enough. After all, engineers had coined\nthe word _kilobuck_ —“a scientist’s idea of a short way to say ‘a thousand\ndollars,’”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1357816) _The New York Times_\nhelpfully explained in 1951. The measures of information climbed up an\nexponential scale, as the realization dawned in the 1960s that everything to\ndo with information would now grow exponentially. That idea was casually\nexpressed by Gordon Moore, who had been an undergraduate studying chemistry\nwhen Shannon jotted his note and found his way to electronic engineering and\nthe development of integrated circuits. In 1965, three years before he founded\nthe Intel Corporation, Moore was merely, modestly suggesting that within a\ndecade, by 1975, as many as 65,000 transistors could be combined on a single\nwafer of silicon. He predicted a doubling every year or two—a doubling of the\nnumber of components that could be packed on a chip, but then also, as it\nturned out, the doubling of all kinds of memory capacity and processing speed,\na halving of size and cost, seemingly without end.\n\nKilobits could be used to express speed of transmission as well as quantity of\nstorage. As of 1972, businesses could lease high-speed lines carrying data as\nfast as 240 kilobits per second. Following the lead of IBM, whose hardware\ntypically processed information in chunks of eight bits, engineers soon\nadopted the modern and slightly whimsical unit, the byte. Bits and bytes. A\nkilobyte, then, represented 8,000 bits; a megabyte (following hard upon), 8\nmillion. In the order of things as worked out by international standards\ncommittees, _mega_ \\- led to _giga-, tera-, peta-_ , and _exa-_ , drawn from\nGreek, though with less and less linguistic fidelity. That was enough, for\neverything measured, until 1991, when the need was seen for the zettabyte\n(1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) and the inadvertently comic sounding yottabyte\n(1,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000). In this climb up the exponential ladder\ninformation left other gauges behind. Money, for example, is scarce by\ncomparison. After kilobucks, there were megabucks and gigabucks, and people\ncan joke about inflation leading to terabucks, but all the money in the world,\nall the wealth amassed by all the generations of humanity, does not amount to\na petabuck.\n\nThe 1970s were the decade of megabytes. In the summer of 1970, IBM introduced\ntwo new computer models with more memory than ever before: the Model 155, with\n768,000 bytes of memory, and the larger Model 165, with a full megabyte, in a\nlarge cabinet. One of these room-filling mainframes could be purchased for\n$4,674,160. By 1982 Prime Computer was marketing a megabyte of memory on a\nsingle circuit board, for $36,000. When the publishers of the _Oxford English\nDictionary_ began digitizing its contents in 1987 (120 typists; an IBM\nmainframe), they estimated its size at a gigabyte. A gigabyte also encompasses\nthe entire human genome. A thousand of those would fill a terabyte. A terabyte\nwas the amount of disk storage Larry Page and Sergey Brin managed to patch\ntogether with the help of $15,000 spread across their personal credit cards in\n1998, when they were Stanford graduate students building a search-engine\nprototype, which they first called BackRub and then renamed Google. A terabyte\nis how much data a typical analog television station broadcasts daily, and it\nwas the size of the United States government’s database of patent and\ntrademark records when it went online in 1998. By 2010, one could buy a\nterabyte disc drive for a hundred dollars and hold it in the palm of one hand.\nThe books in the Library of Congress represent about 10 terabytes (as Shannon\nguessed), and the number is many times more when images and recording music\nare counted. The library now archives web sites; by February 2010 it had\ncollected 160 terabytes’ worth.\n\nAs the train hurtled onward, its passengers sometimes felt the pace\nforeshortening their sense of their own history. Moore’s law had looked simple\non paper, but its consequences left people struggling to find metaphors with\nwhich to understand their experience. The computer scientist Jaron Lanier\ndescribes the feeling this way: “It’s as if you kneel to plant the seed of a\ntree and it grows so fast that it swallows your whole town before you can even\nrise to your feet.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1358167)\n\nA more familiar metaphor is the cloud. All that information—all that\ninformation capacity—looms over us, not quite visible, not quite tangible, but\nawfully real; amorphous, spectral; hovering nearby, yet not situated in any\none place. Heaven must once have felt this way to the faithful. People talk\nabout shifting their lives to the cloud—their informational lives, at least.\nYou may store photographs in the cloud; Google will manage your business in\nthe cloud; Google is putting all the world’s books into the cloud; e-mail\npasses to and from the cloud and never really leaves the cloud. All\ntraditional ideas of privacy, based on doors and locks, physical remoteness\nand invisibility, are upended in the cloud.\n\nMoney lives in the cloud; the old forms are vestigial tokens of knowledge\nabout who owns what, who owes what. To the twenty-first century these will be\nseen as anachronisms, quaint or even absurd: bullion carried from shore to\nshore in fragile ships, subject to the tariffs of pirates and the god\nPoseidon; metal coins tossed from moving cars into baskets at highway\ntollgates and thereafter trucked about (now the history of your automobile is\nin the cloud); paper checks torn from pads and signed in ink; tickets for\ntrains, performances, air travel, or anything at all, printed on weighty\nperforated paper with watermarks, holograms, or fluorescent fibers; and, soon\nenough, all forms of cash. The economy of the world is transacted in the\ncloud.\n\nIts physical aspect could not be less cloudlike. Server farms proliferate in\nunmarked brick buildings and steel complexes, with smoked windows or no\nwindows, miles of hollow floors, diesel generators, cooling towers, seven-foot\nintake fans, and aluminum chimney\nstacks.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1358429) This hidden infrastructure\ngrows in a symbiotic relationship with the electrical infrastructure it\nincreasingly resembles. There are information switchers, control centers, and\nsubstations. They are clustered and distributed. These are the wheel-works;\nthe cloud is their avatar.\n\nThe information produced and consumed by humankind used to vanish—that was the\nnorm, the default. The sights, the sounds, the songs, the spoken word just\nmelted away. Marks on stone, parchment, and paper were the special case. It\ndid not occur to Sophocles’ audiences that it would be sad for his plays to be\nlost; they enjoyed the show. Now expectations have inverted. Everything may be\nrecorded and preserved, at least potentially: every musical performance; every\ncrime in a shop, elevator, or city street; every volcano or tsunami on the\nremotest shore; every card played or piece moved in an online game; every\nrugby scrum and cricket match. Having a camera at hand is normal, not\nexceptional; something like 500 billion images were captured in 2010. YouTube\nwas streaming more than a billion videos a day. Most of this is haphazard and\nunorganized, but there are extreme cases. The computer pioneer Gordon Bell, at\nMicrosoft Research in his seventies, began recording every moment of his day,\nevery conversation, message, document, a megabyte per hour or a gigabyte per\nmonth, wearing around his neck what he called a “SenseCam” to create what he\ncalled a “LifeLog.” Where does it end? Not with the Library of Congress.\n\nIt is finally natural—even inevitable—to ask how much information is in the\nuniverse. It is the consequence of Charles Babbage and Edgar Allan Poe saying,\n“No thought can perish.” Seth Lloyd does the math. He is a moon-faced,\nbespectacled quantum engineer at MIT, a theorist and designer of quantum\ncomputers. The universe, by existing, registers information, he says. By\nevolving in time, it processes information. How much? To figure that out,\nLloyd takes into account how fast this “computer” works and how long it has\nbeen working. Considering the fundamental limit on speed,\n![](images/00066.jpg) operations per second (“where _E_ is the system’s\naverage energy above the ground state and ![](images/00067.jpg) = 1.0545 ×\n10−34 joule-sec is Planck’s reduced constant”), and on memory space, limited\nby entropy to _S_ /_k_ _B_ ln 2 (“where _S_ is the system’s thermodynamic\nentropy and _k_ _B_ = 1.38 × 10−23 joules/K is Boltzmann’s constant”), along\nwith the speed of light and the age of the universe since the Big Bang, Lloyd\ncalculates that the universe can have performed something on the order of\n10120 “ops” in its entire history.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1358692)\nConsidering “every degree of freedom of every particle in the universe,” it\ncould now hold something like 1090 bits. And counting.\n\n\n# 15 | NEW NEWS EVERY DAY\n\n\n##\n\n> (And Such Like)\n\n> _Sorry for all the ups and downs of the web site in recent days. The way I\n> understand it, freakish accumulations of ice weigh down the branches of the\n> Internet and trucks carrying packets of information skid all over the\n> place._\n\n> —Andrew Tobias (2007)[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1359063)\n\nAS THE PRINTING PRESS, the telegraph, the typewriter, the telephone, the\nradio, the computer, and the Internet prospered, each in its turn, people\nsaid, as if for the first time, that a burden had been placed on human\ncommunication: new complexity, new detachment, and a frightening new excess.\nIn 1962 the president of the American Historical Association, Carl\nBridenbaugh, warned his colleagues that human existence was undergoing a\n“Great Mutation”—so sudden and so radical “that we are now suffering something\nlike historical amnesia.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1359386) He lamented\nthe decline of reading; the distancing from nature (which he blamed in part on\n“ugly yellow Kodak boxes” and “the transistor radio everywhere”); and the loss\nof shared culture. Most of all, for the preservers and recorders of the past,\nhe worried about the new tools and techniques available to scholars: “that\nBitch-goddess, Quantification”; “the data processing machines”; as well as\n“those frightening projected scanning devices, which we are told will read\ndocuments and books for us.” _More_ was not _better_ , he declared:\n\n> > Notwithstanding the incessant chatter about communication that we hear\n> daily, it has not improved; actually it has become more\n> difficult.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1359667)\n\nThese remarks became well known in several iterations: first, the oral\naddress, heard by about a thousand people in the ballroom of Conrad Hilton’s\nhotel in Chicago on the last Saturday evening on\n1962;[♦](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1359860) next, the printed version in the\nsociety’s journal in 1963; and then, a generation later, an online version,\nwith its far greater reach and perhaps greater durability as well.\n\nElizabeth Eisenstein encountered the printed version in 1963, when she was\nteaching history as a part-time adjunct lecturer at American University in\nWashington (the best job she could get, as a woman with a Harvard Ph.D.).\nLater she identified that moment as the starting point of fifteen years of\nresearch that culminated in her landmark of scholarship, two volumes titled\n_The Printing Press as an Agent of Change_. Before Eisenstein’s work appeared\nin 1979, no one had attempted a comprehensive study of printing as the\ncommunications revolution essential to the transition from medieval times to\nmodernity. Textbooks, as she noted, tended to slot the printing press\nsomewhere between the Black Death and the discovery of\nAmerica.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1360119) She placed Gutenberg’s\ninvention at center stage: the shift from script to print; the rise of\nprinting shops in the cities of fifteenth-century Europe; the transformation\nin “data collection, storage and retrieval systems and communications\nnetworks.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1360474) She emphasized modestly that\nshe would treat printing only as _an_ agent of change, but she left readers\nconvinced of its indispensable part in the transformations of early modern\nEurope: the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and the birth of science.\nIt was “a decisive point of no return in human\nhistory.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1360676) It shaped the modern mind.\n\nIt shaped the minds of historians, too; she was interested in the unconscious\nmental habits of her profession. As she embarked on her project, she began to\nbelieve that scholars were too often blinded to the effects of the very medium\nin which they swam. She gave credit to Marshall McLuhan, whose _Gutenberg\nGalaxy_ had appeared in 1962, for forcing them to refocus their gaze. In the\nage of scribes, the culture had only primitive reckonings of chronology:\nmuddled timelines counted the generations from Adam, or Noah, or Romulus and\nRemus. “Attitudes toward historical change,” she wrote, “will be found only\noccasionally in writings ostensibly devoted to ‘history’ and often have to be\nread into such writings. They must also be read into sagas and epics, sacred\nscriptures, funerary inscriptions, glyphs and ciphers, vast stone monuments,\ndocuments locked in chests in muniment rooms, and marginal notations on\nmanuscript.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1361051) The sense of _when_ we\nare—the ability to see the past spread out before one; the internalization of\nmental time charts; the appreciation of anachronism—came with the shift to\nprint.\n\nAs a duplicating machine, the printing press not only made texts cheaper and\nmore accessible; its real power was to make them stable. “Scribal culture,”\nEisenstein wrote, was “constantly enfeebled by erosion, corruption, and\nloss.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1361240) Print was trustworthy, reliable,\nand permanent.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1361410) When Tycho Brahe spent\nhis countless hours poring over planetary and star tables, he could count on\nothers checking the same tables, now and in the future. When Kepler computed\nhis own far more accurate catalogue, he was leveraging the tables of\nlogarithms published by Napier. Meanwhile, print shops were not only spreading\nMartin Luther’s theses but, more important, the Bible itself. The revolution\nof Protestantism hinged more on Bible reading than on any point of\ndoctrine—print overcoming script; the codex supplanting the scroll; and the\nvernacular replacing the ancient languages. Before print, scripture was not\ntruly fixed. All forms of knowledge achieved stability and permanence, not\nbecause paper was more durable than papyrus but simply because there were many\ncopies.\n\nIn 1963, reading the warnings of the president of the American Historical\nAssociation, Eisenstein found herself agreeing that the profession faced a\ncrisis, of sorts. But she felt Bridenbaugh had it exactly backward. He thought\nthe problem was forgetfulness: “As I see it,” he said dramatically, “mankind\nis faced with nothing short of the loss of its memory, and this memory is\nhistory.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1361669) Eisenstein, looking at the\nsame new information technologies that so troubled older historians, drew the\nopposite lesson. The past is not receding from view but, on the contrary,\nbecoming _more_ accessible and _more_ visible. “In an age that has seen the\ndeciphering of Linear B and the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls,” she wrote,\n“there appears to be little reason to be concerned about ‘the loss of\nmankind’s memory.’ There are good reasons for being concerned about the\noverloading of its circuits.” As for the amnesia lamented by Bridenbaugh and\nso many of his colleagues:\n\n> > This is a misreading of the predicament confronting historians today. It\n> is not the onset of amnesia that accounts for present difficulties but a\n> more complete recall than any prior generation has ever experienced. Steady\n> recovery, not obliteration, accumulation, rather than loss, have led to the\n> present impasse.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1361946)\n\nFrom her point of view, a five-centuries-old communications revolution was\nstill gathering momentum. How could they not see this?\n\n“Overloading of circuits” was a fairly new metaphor to express a sensation—\n_too much information_ —that felt new. It had always felt new. One hungers for\nbooks; rereads a cherished few; begs or borrows more; waits at the library\ndoor, and perhaps, in the blink of an eye, finds oneself in a state of\nsurfeit: _too much to read_. In 1621 the Oxford scholar Robert Burton (who\namassed one of the world’s largest private libraries, 1,700 books, but never a\nthesaurus) gave voice to the feeling:\n\n> > I hear new news every day, and those ordinary rumours of war, plagues,\n> fires, inundations, thefts, murders, massacres, meteors, comets, spectrums,\n> prodigies, apparitions, of towns taken, cities besieged in France, Germany,\n> Turkey, Persia, Poland, &c. daily musters and preparations, and such like,\n> which these tempestuous times afford, battles fought, so many men slain,\n> monomachies, shipwrecks, piracies, and sea-fights, peace, leagues,\n> stratagems, and fresh alarms. A vast confusion of vows, wishes, actions,\n> edicts, petitions, lawsuits, pleas, laws, proclamations, complaints,\n> grievances are daily brought to our ears. New books every day, pamphlets,\n> currantoes, stories, whole catalogues of volumes of all sorts, new\n> paradoxes, opinions, schisms, heresies, controversies in philosophy,\n> religion, &c. Now come tidings of weddings, maskings, mummeries,\n> entertainments, jubilees, embassies, tilts and tournaments, trophies,\n> triumphs, revels, sports, plays: then again, as in a new shifted scene,\n> treasons, cheating tricks, robberies, enormous villanies in all kinds,\n> funerals, burials, deaths of Princes, new discoveries, expeditions; now\n> comical then tragical matters. To-day we hear of new Lords and officers\n> created, to-morrow of some great men deposed, and then again of fresh\n> honours conferred; one is let loose, another imprisoned; one purchaseth,\n> another breaketh: he thrives, his neighbour turns bankrupt; now plenty, then\n> again dearth and famine; one runs, another rides, wrangles, laughs, weeps\n> &c. Thus I daily hear, and such like.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1362193)\n\nHe thought information glut was new then. He was not complaining; just amazed.\nProtests followed soon enough, however. Leibniz feared a return to\nbarbarism—“to which result that horrible mass of books which keeps on growing\nmight contribute very much. For in the end the disorder will become nearly\ninsurmountable.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1362480) Alexander Pope wrote\nsatirically of “those days, when (after Providence had permitted the invention\nof Printing as a scourge for the sins of the learned) Paper also became so\ncheap, and printers so numerous, that a deluge of Authors covered the\nland.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1362889)\n\n_Deluge_ became a common metaphor for people describing information surfeit.\nThere is a sensation of drowning: information as a rising, churning flood. Or\nit calls to mind bombardment, data impinging in a series of blows, from all\nsides, too fast. Fear of the cacophony of voices can have a religious\nmotivation, a worry about secular noise overwhelming the truth. T. S. Eliot\nexpressed that in 1934:\n\n> Knowledge of speech, but not of silence;\n>\n> Knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word.\n>\n> All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance,\n>\n> All our ignorance brings us nearer to death,\n>\n> But nearness to death no nearer to\n> GOD.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1363141)\n\nOr one may dread the breaching of walls that stand before what is unfamiliar,\nor horrible, or terrifying. Or one may lose the ability to impose order on the\nchaos of sensations. The truth seems harder to find amid the multitude of\nplausible fictions.\n\nAfter “information theory” came to be, so did “information overload,”\n“information glut,” “information anxiety,” and “information fatigue,” the last\nrecognized by the _OED_ in 2009 as a timely syndrome: “Apathy, indifference,\nor mental exhaustion arising from exposure to too much information, esp. (in\nlater use) stress induced by the attempt to assimilate excessive amounts of\ninformation from the media, the Internet, or at work.” Sometimes information\nanxiety can coexist with boredom, a particularly confusing combination. David\nFoster Wallace had a more ominous name for this modern condition: Total Noise.\n“The tsunami of available fact, context, and\nperspective”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1363449)—that, he wrote in 2007,\nconstitutes Total Noise. He talked about the sensation of drowning and also of\na loss of autonomy, of personal responsibility for being _informed_. To keep\nup with all the information we need proxies and subcontractors.\n\nAnother way to speak of the anxiety is in terms of the gap between information\nand knowledge. A barrage of data so often fails to tell us what we need to\nknow. Knowledge, in turn, does not guarantee enlightenment or wisdom. (Eliot\nsaid that, too: “Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? / Where is the\nknowledge we have lost in information?”) It is an ancient observation, but one\nthat seemed to bear restating when information became plentiful—particularly\nin a world where all bits are created equal and information is divorced from\nmeaning. The humanist and philosopher of technology Lewis Mumford, for\nexample, restated it in 1970: “Unfortunately, ‘information retrieving,’\nhowever swift, is no substitute for discovering by direct personal inspection\nknowledge whose very existence one had possibly never been aware of, and\nfollowing it at one’s own pace through the further ramification of relevant\nliterature.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1363727) He begged for a return to\n“moral self-discipline.” There is a whiff of nostalgia in this sort of\nwarning, along with an undeniable truth: that in the pursuit of knowledge,\nslower can be better. Exploring the crowded stacks of musty libraries has its\nown rewards. Reading—even browsing—an old book can yield sustenance denied by\na database search. Patience is a virtue, gluttony a sin.\n\nEven in 1970, however, Mumford was not thinking about databases or any of the\nelectronic technologies that loomed. He complained about “the multiplication\nof microfilms.” He also complained about too many books. Without “self-imposed\nrestraints,” he warned, “the overproduction of books will bring about a state\nof intellectual enervation and depletion hardly to be distinguished from\nmassive ignorance.” Restraints were not imposed. Titles continue to multiply.\nBooks about information glut join the cornucopia; no irony is intended when\nthe online bookseller Amazon.com transmits messages like “Start reading _Data\nSmog_ on your Kindle in _under a minute_ ” and “Surprise me! See a random page\nin this book.”\n\nThe electronic communication technologies arrived so quickly, almost without\nwarning. The word _e-mail_ appeared in print (so far as the _OED_ can\ndetermine) in 1982, in _Computerworld_ magazine, which had barely heard\nreports: “ADR/Email is reportedly easy to use and features simple, English\nverbs and prompt screens.” Next year, the journal _Infosystems_ declared,\n“Email promotes movement of information through space.” And the year after\nthat—still a full decade before most people heard the word—a Swedish computer\nscientist named Jacob Palme at the QZ Computer Center in Stockholm issued a\nprescient warning—as simple, accurate, and thorough as any that followed in\nthe next decades. Palme began:\n\n> > Electronic mail system can, if used by many people, cause severe\n> information overload problems. The cause of this problem is that it is so\n> easy to send a message to a large number of people, and that systems are\n> often designed to give the sender too much control of the communication\n> process, and the receiver too little\n> control.…[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1364068)\n>\n\n>> People get too many messages, which they do not have time to read. This\nalso means that the really important messages are difficult to find in a large\nflow of less important messages.\n\n>\n\n>> In the future, when we get larger and larger message systems, and these\nsystems get more and more interconnected, this will be a problem for almost\nall users of these systems.\n\nHe had statistics from his local network: the average message took 2 minutes,\n36 seconds to write and just 28 seconds to read. Which would have been fine,\nexcept that people could so easily send many copies of the same message.\n\nWhen psychologists or sociologists try to study information overload with the\nmethods of their disciplines, they get mixed results. As early as 1963, a pair\nof psychologists set out to quantify the effect of extra information on the\nprocess of clinical diagnosis.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1364431) As they\nexpected, they found that “too much information”—not easy to define, they\nadmitted—often contaminated judgment. They titled their paper “Does One\nSometimes Know Too Much?” and somewhat gleefully listed alternative titles, as\na bonus: “Never Have So Many Done So Little”; “Are You Getting More Now But\nPredicting It Less?”; and “Too Much Information Is a Dangerous Thing.” Others\ntried to measure the effects of information load on blood pressure, heart\nrhythms, and respiration rates.\n\nOne worker in the area was Siegfried Streufert, who reported in a series of\npapers in the 1960s that the relation between information load and information\nhandling typically looked like an “inverted U”: more information was helpful\nat first, then not so helpful, and then actually harmful. One of his studies\ntook 185 university students (all male) and had them pretend to be commanders\nmaking decisions in a tactical game. They were told:\n\n> > The information you are receiving is prepared for you in the same way it\n> would be prepared for real commanders by a staff of intelligence officers.…\n> You may instruct these intelligence officers to increase or decrease the\n> amount of information they present to you.… Please check your preference: I\n> would prefer to:\n>\n\n>> receive much more information\n\n>\n\n>> receive a little more information\n\n>\n\n>> receive about the same amount of information\n\n>\n\n>> receive a little less information\n\n>\n\n>> receive much less information.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1364765)\n\nNo matter what they chose, their preferences were ignored. The experimenter,\nnot the subjects, predetermined the amount of information. Streufert concluded\nfrom the data that “superoptimal” information loads caused poor performance,\n“yet it should be noted that even at highly superoptimal information loads\n(i.e., 25 messages per 30-minute period), the subjects are still asking for\nincreased information levels.” Later, he used similar methodology to study the\neffects of drinking too much coffee.\n\nBy the 1980s, researchers were speaking confidently about the “information-\nload paradigm.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1365164) This was a paradigm\nbased on a truism: that people can only “absorb” or “process” a limited amount\nof information. Various investigators found surfeits causing not only\nconfusion and frustration, but also blurred vision and dishonesty. Experiments\nthemselves had a broad menu of information to process: measurements of memory\nspan; ideas of channel capacity drawn from Shannon; and variations on the\ntheme of signal-to-noise ratio. A common, if dubious, approach to research was\ndirect introspection. One small project in 1998 took as a “community or folk\ngroup” graduate students in library and information science at the University\nof Illinois; all agreed, when asked, that they suffered from information\noverload, due to “e-mail, meetings, listservs, and in-basket paper\npiles.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1365489) Most felt that a surfeit of\ninformation tainted their leisure time as well as their work time. Some\nreported headaches. The tentative conclusion: information overload is real;\nalso, it is both a “code phrase” and a myth. The research can only press\nonward.\n\nHaving to think of information as a burden is confusing, as Charles Bennett\nsays. “We pay to have newspapers delivered, not taken\naway.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1365816) But the thermodynamics of\ncomputation shows that yesterday’s newspaper takes up space that Maxwell’s\ndemon needs for today’s work, and modern experience teaches the same.\nForgetting used to be a failing, a waste, a sign of senility. Now it takes\neffort. It may be as important as remembering.\n\nFacts were once dear; now they are cheap. Once, people would turn to the pages\nof _Whitaker’s Almanack_ , published yearly in Britain, or the _World Almanac_\n, in the United States, to find the names and dates of monarchs and\npresidents, tables of holidays and high water, sizes and populations of\nfaraway places, or the ships and chief officers of the navy. Lacking the\nalmanac, or seeking an even more obscure fact, they might call on a man or\nwoman of experience behind a desk at a public library. When George Bernard\nShaw needed the whereabouts of the nearest crematorium—his wife was dying—he\nopened the almanac and was aggrieved. “I have just found an astonishing\nomission in Whitaker,” he wrote to the editor. “As the desired information is\njust what one goes to your invaluable almanack for, may I suggest that a list\nof the 58 crematoria now working in the country, and instructions what to do,\nwould be a very desirable addition.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1366122)\nHis letter is poignant. He does not mention his wife—only “a case of serious\nillness”—and refers to himself as “the bereaved enquirer.” Shaw had a\ntelegraph address and a telephone but took it for granted that facts were to\nbe found in print.\n\nFor many, the telephone had already begun to extend the reach of the\ninquisitive. Twentieth-century people realized that they could know instantly\nthe scores of sporting events they had not witnessed; so many came up with the\nidea of telephoning the newspaper that _The New York Times_ felt compelled to\nprint a front-page notice in 1929 begging readers to desist: “Don’t Ask by\nTelephone for World’s Series Scores.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1366374)\nNow the information, in “real time,” is considered a birthright.\n\nWhat do you do when you have everything at last? Daniel Dennett imagined—in\n1990, just before the Internet made this dream possible—that electronic\nnetworks could upend the economics of publishing poetry. Instead of slim\nbooks, elegant specialty items marketed to connoisseurs, what if poets could\npublish online, instantly reaching not hundreds but millions of readers, not\nfor tens of dollars but for fractions of pennies? That same year, Sir Charles\nChadwyck-Healey, a publisher, conceived of the English Poetry Full-Text\nDatabase as he walked one day through the British Library, and four years\nlater he had produced it—not the present or future of poetry, but the past,\nand not, at first, online but in four compact discs, 165,000 poems by 1,250\npoets spanning thirteen centuries, priced at $51,000. Readers and critics had\nto figure out what to make of this. Not _read_ it, surely, the way they would\nread a book. Read _in_ it, perhaps. Search it, for a word or an epigraph or a\nfragment half remembered.\n\nAnthony Lane, reviewing the database for _The New Yorker_ , found himself\nswinging from elation to dismay and back. “You hunch like a pianist over the\nkeys,” he wrote, “knowing what awaits you, thinking, Ah, the untold wealth of\nEnglish literature! What hidden jewels I shall excavate from the deepest mines\nof human fancy!”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1366629) Then come the\nmacaronics, the clunkers, the flood of bombast and mediocrity. The sheer\nunordered mass begins to wear you down. Not that Lane sounds at all weary.\n“What a steaming _heap_ ,” he cries, and he revels in it. “Never have I beheld\nsuch a magnificent tribute to the powers of human incompetence—and also, by\nthe same token, to the blessings of human forgetfulness.” Where else would he\nhave found the utterly forgotten Thomas Freeman (not in Wikipedia) and this\nlovely self-referential couplet:\n\n> Whoop, whoop, me thinkes I heare my Reader cry,\n>\n> Here is rime doggrell: I confesse it I.\n\nThe CD-ROMs are already obsolete. All English poetry is in the network now—or\nif not all, some approximation thereof, and if not now, then soon.\n\nThe past folds accordion-like into the present. Different media have different\nevent horizons—for the written word, three millennia; for recorded sound, a\ncentury and a half—and within their time frames the old becomes as accessible\nas the new. Yellowed newspapers come back to life. Under headings of _50 Years\nAgo_ and _100 Years Ago_ , veteran publications recycle their archives:\nrecipes, card-play techniques, science, gossip, once out of print and now\nready for use. Record companies rummage through their attics to release, or\nre-release, every scrap of music, rarities, B-sides, and bootlegs. For a\ncertain time, collectors, scholars, or fans _possessed_ their books and their\nrecords. There was a line between what they had and what they did not. For\nsome, the music they owned (or the books, or the videos) became part of who\nthey were. That line fades away. Most of Sophocles’ plays are lost, but those\nthat survive are available at the touch of a button. Most of Bach’s music was\nunknown to Beethoven; we have it all—partitas, cantatas, and ringtones. It\ncomes to us instantly, or at light speed. It is a symptom of omniscience. It\nis what the critic Alex Ross calls the Infinite Playlist, and he sees how\nmixed is the blessing: “anxiety in place of fulfillment, an addictive cycle of\ncraving and malaise. No sooner has one experience begun than the thought of\nwhat else is out there intrudes.” The embarrassment of riches. Another\nreminder that information is not knowledge, and knowledge is not wisdom.\n\nStrategies emerge for coping. There are many, but in essence they all boil\ndown to two: filter and search. The harassed consumer of information turns to\nfilters to separate the metal from the dross; filters include blogs and\naggregators—the choice raises issues of trust and taste. The need for filters\nintrudes on any thought experiment about the wonders of abundant information.\nWhen Dennett imagined his Complete Poetry Network, he saw the problem. “The\nobvious counterhypothesis arises from population\nmemetics,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1366888) he said. “If such a network\nwere established, no poetry lover would be willing to wade through thousands\nof electronic files filled with doggerel, looking for good poems.” Filters\nwould be needed—editors and critics. “They flourish because of the short\nsupply and limited capacity of minds, whatever the transmission media between\nminds.” When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive.\n\nFor the same reason, mechanisms of search— _engines_ , in cyberspace—find\nneedles in haystacks. By now we’ve learned that it is not enough for\ninformation to _exist_. A “file” was originally—in sixteenth-century England—a\nwire on which slips and bills and notes and letters could be strung for\npreservation and reference. Then came file folders, file drawers, and file\ncabinets; then the electronic namesakes of all these; and the inevitable\nirony. Once a piece of information is _filed_ , it is statistically unlikely\never to be seen again by human eyes. Even in 1847, Augustus De Morgan,\nBabbage’s friend, knew this. For any random book, he said, a library was no\nbetter than a wastepaper warehouse. “Take the library of the British Museum,\nfor instance, valuable and useful and accessible as it is: what chance has a\nwork of being known to be there, merely because it is there? If it be wanted,\nit can be asked for; but to be wanted it must be known. Nobody can rummage the\nlibrary.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1367212)\n\nToo much information, and so much of it lost. An unindexed Internet site is in\nthe same limbo as a misshelved library book. This is why the successful and\npowerful business enterprises of the information economy are built on\nfiltering and searching. Even Wikipedia is a combination of the two: powerful\nsearch, mainly driven by Google, and a vast, collaborative filter, striving to\ngather the true facts and screen out the false ones. Searching and filtering\nare all that stand between this world and the Library of Babel.\n\nIn their computer-driven incarnations these strategies seem new. But they are\nnot. In fact, a considerable part of the gear and tackle of print media—now\ntaken for granted, invisible as old wallpaper—evolved in direct response to\nthe sense of information surfeit. They are mechanisms of selection and\nsorting: alphabetical indexes, book reviews, library shelving schemes and card\ncatalogues, encyclopedias, anthologies and digests, books of quotation and\nconcordances and gazetteers. When Robert Burton held forth on all his “new\nnews every day,” his “new paradoxes, opinions, schisms, heresies,\ncontroversies in philosophy, religion, &c,” it was by way of justifying his\nlife’s great project, _The Anatomy of Melancholy_ , a rambling compendium of\nall previous knowledge. Four centuries earlier, the Dominican monk Vincent of\nBeauvais tried to set down his own version of everything that was known,\ncreating one of the first medieval encyclopedias, _Speculum Maius_ , “The\nGreat Mirror”—his manuscripts organized into eighty books, 9,885 chapters. His\njustification: “The multitude of books, the shortness of time and the\nslipperiness of memory do not allow all things which are written to be equally\nretained in the mind.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1367537) Ann Blair, a\nHarvard historian of early modern Europe, puts it simply: “The perception of\nan overabundance of books fueled the production of many more\nbooks.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1367961) In their own way, too, the\nnatural sciences such as botany arose in answer to information overload. The\nexplosion of recognized species (and names) in the sixteenth century demanded\nnew routines of standardized description. Botanical encyclopedias appeared,\nwith glossaries and indexes. Brian Ogilvie sees the story of Renaissance\nbotanists as “driven by the need to master the information overload that they\nhad unwittingly produced.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1368146) They created\na “ _confusio rerum_ ,” he says, “accompanied by a _confusio verborum_.”\nConfused mass of new things; confusion of words. Natural history was born to\nchannel information.\n\nWhen new information technologies alter the existing landscape, they bring\ndisruption: new channels and new dams rerouting the flow of irrigation and\ntransport. The balance between creators and consumers is upset: writers and\nreaders, speakers and listeners. Market forces are confused; information can\nseem too cheap and too expensive at the same time. The old ways of organizing\nknowledge no longer work. Who will search; who will filter? The disruption\nbreeds hope mixed with fear. In the first days of radio Bertolt Brecht,\nhopeful, fearful, and quite obsessed, expressed this feeling aphoristically:\n“A man who has something to say and finds no listeners is bad off. Even worse\noff are listeners who can’t find anyone with something to say to\nthem.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1368517) The calculus always changes. Ask\nbloggers and tweeters: Which is worse, too many mouths or too many ears?\n\n\n# EPILOGUE\n\n\n##\n\n> (The Return of Meaning)\n\n> _It was inevitable that meaning would force its way back in._\n\n> —Jean-Pierre Dupuy (2000)[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1368968)\n\nTHE EXHAUSTION, the surfeit, the pressure of information have all been seen\nbefore. Credit Marshall McLuhan for this insight—his most essential—in 1962:\n\n> > We are today as far into the electric age as the Elizabethans had advanced\n> into the typographical and mechanical age. And we are experiencing the same\n> confusions and indecisions which they had felt when living simultaneously in\n> two contrasted forms of society and\n> experience.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1369319)\n\nBut as much as it is the same, this time it is different. We are a half\ncentury further along now and can begin to see how vast the scale and how\nstrong the effects of connectedness.\n\nOnce again, as in the first days of the telegraph, we speak of the\nannihilation of space and time. For McLuhan this was prerequisite to the\ncreation of global consciousness—global _knowing_. “Today,” he wrote, “we have\nextended our central nervous systems in a global embrace, abolishing both\nspace and time as far as our planet is concerned. Rapidly, we approach the\nfinal phase of the extensions of man—the technological simulation of\nconsciousness, when the creative process of knowing will be collectively and\ncorporately extended to the whole of human\nsociety.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1369601) Walt Whitman had said it\nbetter a century before:\n\n> > What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you, passing under the\n> seas?\n>\n\n>> Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the\nglobe?[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1369922)\n\nThe wiring of the world, followed hard upon by the spread of wireless\ncommunication, gave rise to romantic speculation about the birth of a new\nglobal organism. Even in the nineteenth century mystics and theologians began\nspeaking of a shared mind or collective consciousness, formed through the\ncollaboration of millions of people placed in communication with one\nanother.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1370208)\n\nSome went so far as to view this new creature as a natural product of\ncontinuing evolution—a way for humans to fulfill their special destiny, after\ntheir egos had been bruised by Darwinism. “It becomes absolutely necessary,”\nwrote the French philosopher Édouard Le Roy in 1928, “to place [man] above the\nlower plane of nature, in a position which enables him to dominate\nit.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1370749) How? By creating the\n“noosphere”—the sphere of mind—a climactic “mutation” in evolutionary history.\nHis friend the Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin did even more to\npromote the noosphere, which he called a “new skin” on the earth:\n\n> > Does it not seem as though a great body is in the process of being\n> born—with its limbs, its nervous system, its centers of perception, its\n> memory—the very body of that great something to come which was to fulfill\n> the aspirations that had been aroused in the reflective being by the freshly\n> acquired consciousness of its interdependence with and responsibility for a\n> whole in evolution?[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1371416)\n\nThat was a mouthful even in French, and less mystical spirits considered it\nbunkum (“nonsense, tricked out with a variety of tedious metaphysical\nconceits,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1371738) judged Peter Medawar), but\nmany people were testing the same idea, not least among them the writers of\nscience fiction.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1372121) Internet pioneers a\nhalf century later liked it, too.\n\nH. G. Wells was known for his science fiction, but it was as a purposeful\nsocial critic that he published a little book in 1938, late in his life, with\nthe title _World Brain_. There was nothing fanciful about what he wanted to\npromote: an improved educational system throughout the whole “body” of\nhumanity. Out with the hodgepodge of local fiefdoms: “our multitude of unco-\nordinated ganglia, our powerless miscellany of universities, research\ninstitutions, literatures with a\npurpose.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1372375) In with “a reconditioned and\nmore powerful Public Opinion.” His World Brain would rule the globe. “We do\nnot want dictators, we do not want oligarchic parties or class rule, we want a\nwidespread world intelligence conscious of itself.” Wells believed that a new\ntechnology was poised to revolutionize the production and distribution of\ninformation: microfilm. Tiny pictures of printed materials could be made for\nless than a penny per page, and librarians from Europe and the United States\nmet to discuss the possibilities in Paris in 1937 for a World Congress of\nUniversal Documentation. New ways of indexing the literature would be needed,\nthey realized. The British Museum embarked on a program of microfilming four\nthousand of its oldest books. Wells made this prediction: “In a few score\nyears there will be thousands of workers at this business of ordering and\ndigesting knowledge where now you have\none.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1372623) He admitted that he meant to be\ncontroversial and provocative. Attending the congress himself on behalf of\nEngland, he foresaw a “sort of cerebrum for humanity, a cerebral cortex which\nwill constitute a memory and a perception of current reality for the whole\nhuman race.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1372799) Yet he was imagining\nsomething mundane, as well as utopian: an encyclopedia. It would be a\nsuccessor to the great national encyclopedias—the French encyclopedia of\nDiderot, the _Britannica_ , the German _Konversations-Lexikon_ (he did not\nmention China’s _Four Great Books of Song_)—which had stabilized and equipped\n“the general intelligence.”\n\nThis new world encyclopedia would transcend the static form of the book,\nprinted in volumes, said Wells. Under the direction of a wise professional\nstaff (“very important and distinguished men in the new world”), it would be\nin a state of constant change—“a sort of mental clearinghouse for the mind, a\ndepot where knowledge and ideas are received, sorted, summarized, digested,\nclarified and compared.” Who knows whether Wells would recognize his vision in\nWikipedia? The hurly-burly of competing ideas did not enter into it. His world\nbrain was to be authoritative, but not centralized.\n\n> > It need not be vulnerable as a human head or a human heart is vulnerable.\n> It can be reproduced exactly and fully, in Peru, China, Iceland, Central\n> Africa.… It can have at once the concentration of a craniate animal and the\n> diffused vitality of an amoeba.\n\nFor that matter, he said, “It might have the form of a network.”\n\nIt is not the amount of knowledge that makes a brain. It is not even the\ndistribution of knowledge. It is the interconnectedness. When Wells used the\nword _network_ —a word he liked very much—it retained its original, physical\nmeaning for him, as it would for anyone in his time. He visualized threads or\nwires interlacing: “A network of marvellously gnarled and twisted stems\nbearing little leaves and blossoms”; “an intricate network of wires and\ncables.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1372984) For us that sense is almost\nlost; a network is an abstract object, and its domain is information.\n\nThe birth of information theory came with its ruthless sacrifice of\nmeaning—the very quality that gives information its value and its purpose.\nIntroducing _The Mathematical Theory of Communication_ , Shannon had to be\nblunt. He simply declared meaning to be “irrelevant to the engineering\nproblem.” Forget human psychology; abandon subjectivity.\n\nHe knew there would be resistance. He could hardly deny that messages can have\nmeaning, “that is, they refer to or are correlated according to some system\nwith certain physical or conceptual entities.” (Presumably a “system with\ncertain physical or conceptual entities” would be the world and its\ninhabitants, the kingdom and the power and the glory, amen.) For some, this\nwas just too cold. There was Heinz von Foerster at one of the early\ncybernetics conferences, complaining that information theory was merely about\n“beep beeps,” saying that only when understanding begins, in the human brain,\n“ _then_ information is born—it’s not in the\nbeeps.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1373328) Others dreamed of extending\ninformation theory with a semantic counterpart. Meaning, as ever, remained\nhard to pin down. “I know an uncouth region,” wrote Borges of the Library of\nBabel, “whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of\nfinding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in\ndreams or in the chaotic lines of one’s\npalm.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1373675)\n\nEpistemologists cared about knowledge, not beeps and signals. No one would\nhave bothered to make a philosophy of dots and dashes or puffs of smoke or\nelectrical impulses. It takes a human—or, let’s say, a “cognitive agent”—to\ntake a signal and turn it into information. “Beauty is in the eye of the\nbeholder, and information is in the head of the\nreceiver,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1373996) says Fred Dretske. At any\nrate that is a common view, in epistemology—that “we _invest_ stimuli with\nmeaning, and apart from such investment, they are informationally barren.” But\nDretske argues that distinguishing information and meaning can set a\nphilosopher free. The engineers have provided an opportunity and a challenge:\nto understand how meaning can evolve; how life, handling and coding\ninformation, progresses to interpretation, belief, and knowledge.\n\nStill, who could love a theory that gives false statements as much value as\ntrue statements (at least, in terms of quantity of information)? It was\nmechanistic. It was desiccated. A pessimist, looking backward, might call it a\nharbinger of a soulless Internet at its worst. “The more we ‘communicate’ the\nway we do, the more we create a _hellish_ world,” wrote the Parisian\nphilosopher—also a historian of cybernetics—Jean-Pierre Dupuy.\n\n> > I take “hell” in its theological sense, i.e., a place which is void of\n> _grace_ —the undeserved, unnecessary, surprising, unforeseen. A paradox is\n> at work here: ours is a world about which we pretend to have more and more\n> _information_ but which seems to us increasingly devoid of\n> meaning.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1374283)\n\nThat hellish world, devoid of grace—has it arrived? A world of information\nglut and gluttony; of bent mirrors and counterfeit texts; scurrilous blogs,\nanonymous bigotry, banal messaging. Incessant chatter. The false driving out\nthe true.\n\nThat is not the world I see.\n\nIt was once thought that a perfect language should have an exact one-to-one\ncorrespondence between words and their meanings. There should be no ambiguity,\nno vagueness, no confusion. Our earthly Babel is a falling off from the lost\nspeech of Eden: a catastrophe and a punishment. “I imagine,” writes the\nnovelist Dexter Palmer, “that the entries of the dictionary that lies on the\ndesk in God’s study must have one-to-one correspondences between the words and\ntheir definitions, so that when God sends directives to his angels, they are\ncompletely free from ambiguity. Each sentence that He speaks or writes must be\nperfect, and therefore a miracle.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1374694) We\nknow better now. With or without God, there is no perfect language.\n\nLeibniz thought that if natural language could not be perfect, at least the\ncalculus could: a language of symbols rigorously assigned. “All human thoughts\nmight be entirely resolvable into a small number of thoughts considered as\nprimitive.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1375010) These could then be\ncombined and dissected mechanically, as it were. “Once this had been done,\nwhoever uses such characters would either never make an error, or, at least,\nwould have the possibility of immediately recognizing his mistakes, by using\nthe simplest of tests.” Gödel ended that dream.\n\nOn the contrary, the idea of perfection is contrary to the nature of language.\nInformation theory has helped us understand that—or, if you are a pessimist,\nforced us to understand it. “We are forced to see,” Palmer continues,\n\n> > that words are not themselves ideas, but merely strings of ink marks; we\n> see that sounds are nothing more than waves. In a modern age without an\n> Author looking down on us from heaven, language is not a thing of definite\n> certainty, but infinite possibility; without the comforting illusion of\n> meaningful order we have no choice but to stare into the face of meaningless\n> disorder; without the feeling that meaning can be certain, we find ourselves\n> overwhelmed by all the things that words _might_ mean.\n\nInfinite possibility is good, not bad. Meaningless disorder is to be\nchallenged, not feared. Language maps a boundless world of objects and\nsensations and combinations onto a finite space. The world changes, always\nmixing the static with the ephemeral, and we know that language changes, not\njust from edition to edition of the _Oxford English Dictionary_ but from one\nmoment to the next, and from one person to the next. Everyone’s language is\ndifferent. We can be overwhelmed or we can be emboldened.\n\nMore and more, the lexicon is in the network now—preserved, even as it\nchanges; accessible and searchable. Likewise, human knowledge soaks into the\nnetwork, into the cloud. The web sites, the blogs, the search engines and\nencyclopedias, the analysts of urban legends and the debunkers of the\nanalysts. Everywhere, the true rubs shoulders with the false. No form of\ndigital communication has earned more mockery than the service known as\nTwitter—banality shrink-wrapped, enforcing triviality by limiting all messages\nto 140 characters. The cartoonist Garry Trudeau twittered satirically in the\nguise of an imaginary newsman who could hardly look up from his twittering to\ngather any news. But then, eyewitness Twitter messages provided emergency\ninformation and comfort during terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, and it was\nTwitter feeds from Tehran that made the Iranian protests visible to the world\nin 2009. The aphorism is a form with an honorable history. I barely twitter\nmyself, but even this odd medium, microblogging so quirky and confined, has\nits uses and its enchantment. By 2010 Margaret Atwood, a master of a longer\nform, said she had been “sucked into the Twittersphere like Alice down the\nrabbit hole.”\n\n> > Is it signaling, like telegraphs? Is it Zen poetry? Is it jokes scribbled\n> on the washroom wall? Is it John Hearts Mary carved on a tree? Let’s just\n> say it’s communication, and communication is something human beings like to\n> do.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1375417)\n\nShortly thereafter, the Library of Congress, having been founded to collect\nevery book, decided to preserve every tweet, too. Possibly undignified, and\nprobably redundant, but you never know. It is human communication.\n\nAnd the network has learned a few things that no individual could ever know.\n\nIt identifies CDs of recorded music by looking at the lengths of their\nindividual tracks and consulting a vast database, formed by accretion over\nyears, by the shared contributions of millions of anonymous users. In 2007\nthis database revealed something that had eluded distinguished critics and\nlisteners: that more than one hundred recordings released by the late English\npianist Joyce Hatto—music by Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart, Liszt, and others—were\nactually stolen performances by other pianists. MIT established a Center for\nCollective Intelligence, devoted to finding group wisdom and “harnessing” it.\nIt remains difficult to know when and how much to trust the _wisdom of crowds_\n—the title of a 2004 book by James Surowiecki, to be distinguished from the\n_madness of crowds_ as chronicled in 1841 by Charles Mackay, who declared that\npeople “go mad in herds, while they recover their senses slowly, and one by\none.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1375887) Crowds turn all too quickly into\nmobs, with their time-honored manifestations: manias, bubbles, lynch mobs,\nflash mobs, crusades, mass hysteria, herd mentality, goose-stepping,\nconformity, groupthink—all potentially magnified by network effects and\nstudied under the rubric of information cascades. Collective judgment has\nappealing possibilities; collective self-deception and collective evil have\nalready left a cataclysmic record. But knowledge in the network is different\nfrom group decision making based on copying and parroting. It seems to develop\nby accretion; it can give full weight to quirks and exceptions; the challenge\nis to recognize it and gain access to it. In 2008, Google created an early\nwarning system for regional flu trends based on data no firmer than the\nincidence of Web searches for the word _flu;_ the system apparently discovered\noutbreaks a week sooner than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThis was Google’s way: it approached classic hard problems of artificial\nintelligence—machine translation and voice recognition—not with human experts,\nnot with dictionaries and linguists, but with its voracious data mining of\ntrillions of words in more than three hundred languages. For that matter, its\ninitial approach to searching the Internet relied on the harnessing of\ncollective knowledge.\n\nHere is how the state of search looked in 1994. Nicholson Baker—in a later\ndecade a Wikipedia obsessive; back then the world’s leading advocate for the\npreservation of card catalogues, old newspapers, and other apparently obsolete\npaper—sat at a terminal in a University of California library and typed,\nBROWSE SU[BJECT] CENSORSHIP.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1376167) He\nreceived an error message,\n\n> > LONG SEARCH: Your search consists of one or more very common words, which\n> will retrieve over 800 headings and take a long time to complete,\n\nand a knuckle rapping:\n\n> > Long searches slow the system down for everyone on the catalog and often\n> do not produce useful results. Please type HELP or see a reference librarian\n> for assistance.\n\nAll too typical. Baker mastered the syntax needed for Boolean searches with\ncomplexes of ANDs and ORs and NOTs, to little avail. He cited research on\nscreen fatigue and search failure and information overload and admired a\ntheory that electronic catalogues were “in effect, conducting a program of\n‘aversive operant conditioning’ ” against online search.\n\nHere is how the state of search looked two years later, in 1996. The volume of\nInternet traffic had grown by a factor of ten each year, from 20 terabytes a\nmonth worldwide in 1994 to 200 terabytes a month in 1995, to 2 petabytes in\n1996. Software engineers at the Digital Equipment Corporation’s research\nlaboratory in Palo Alto, California, had just opened to the public a new kind\nof search engine, named AltaVista, continually building and revising an index\nto every page it could find on the Internet—at that point, tens of millions of\nthem. A search for the phrase _truth universally acknowledged_ and the name\n_Darcy_ produced four thousand matches. Among them:\n\n  * The complete if not reliable text of _Pride and Prejudice_ , in several versions, stored on computers in Japan, Sweden, and elsewhere, downloadable free or, in one case, for a fee of $2.25.\n  * More than one hundred answers to the question, “Why did the chicken cross the road?” including “Jane Austen: Because it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single chicken, being possessed of a good fortune and presented with a good road, must be desirous of crossing.”\n  * The statement of purpose of the _Princeton Pacific Asia Review:_ “The strategic importance of the Asia Pacific is a truth universally acknowledged …”\n  * An article about barbecue from the Vegetarian Society UK: “It is a truth universally acknowledged among meat-eaters that …”\n  * The home page of Kevin Darcy, Ireland. The home page of Darcy Cremer, Wisconsin. The home page and boating pictures of Darcy Morse. The vital statistics of Tim Darcy, Australian footballer. The résumé of Darcy Hughes, a fourteen-year-old yard worker and babysitter in British Columbia.\n\nTrivia did not daunt the compilers of this ever-evolving index. They were\nacutely aware of the difference between making a library catalogue—its target\nfixed, known, and finite—and searching a world of information without\nboundaries or limits. They thought they were onto something grand. “We have a\nlexicon of the current language of the\nworld,”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1376468) said the project manager, Allan\nJennings.\n\nThen came Google. Brin and Page moved their fledgling company from their\nStanford dorm rooms into offices in 1998. Their idea was that cyberspace\npossessed a form of self-knowledge, inherent in the links from one page to\nanother, and that a search engine could exploit this knowledge. As other\nscientists had done before, they visualized the Internet as a graph, with\nnodes and links: by early 1998, 150 million nodes joined by almost 2 billion\nlinks. They considered each link as an expression of value—a recommendation.\nAnd they recognized that all links are not equal. They invented a recursive\nway of reckoning value: the rank of a page depends on the value of its\nincoming links; the value of a link depends on the rank of its containing\npage. Not only did they invent it, they published it. Letting the Internet\nknow how Google worked did not hurt Google’s ability to leverage the\nInternet’s knowledge.\n\nAt the same time, the rise of this network of all networks was inspiring new\ntheoretical work on the topology of interconnectedness in very large systems.\nThe science of networks had many origins and evolved along many paths, from\npure mathematics to sociology, but it crystallized in the summer of 1998, with\nthe publication of a letter to _Nature_ from Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz.\nThe letter had three things that combined to make it a sensation: a vivid\ncatchphrase, a nice result, and a surprising assortment of applications. It\nhelped that one of the applications was All the World’s People. The\ncatchphrase was _small world_. When two strangers discover that they have a\nmutual friend—an unexpected connection—they may say, “It’s a small world,” and\nit was in this sense that Watts and Strogatz talked about small-world\nnetworks.\n\nThe defining quality of a small-world network is the one unforgettably\ncaptured by John Guare in his 1990 play, _Six Degrees of Separation_. The\ncanonical explanation is this:\n\n> > I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six\n> other people. Six degrees of separation. Between us and everyone else on\n> this planet. The President of the United States. A gondolier in Venice. Fill\n> in the names.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1376866)\n\nThe idea can be traced back to a 1967 social-networking experiment by the\nHarvard psychologist Stanley Milgram and, even further, to a 1929 short story\nby a Hungarian writer, Frigyes Karinthy, titled “ _Láncszemek_ ”—\n_Chains_.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1377151) Watts and Strogatz took it\nseriously: it seems to be true, and it is counterintuitive, because in the\nkinds of networks they studied, nodes tended to be highly clustered. They are\ncliquish. You may know many people, but they tend to be your neighbors—in a\nsocial space, if not literally—and they tend to know mostly the same people.\nIn the real world, clustering is ubiquitous in complex networks: neurons in\nthe brain, epidemics of infectious disease, electric power grids, fractures\nand channels in oil-bearing rock. Clustering alone means fragmentation: the\noil does not flow, the epidemics sputter out. Faraway strangers remain\nestranged.\n\nBut some nodes may have distant links, and some nodes may have an exceptional\ndegree of connectivity. What Watts and Strogatz discovered in their\nmathematical models is that it takes astonishingly few of these\nexceptions—just a few distant links, even in a tightly clustered network—to\ncollapse the average separation to almost nothing and create a small\nworld.[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1377394) One of their test cases was a\nglobal epidemic: “Infectious diseases are predicted to spread much more easily\nand quickly in a small world; the alarming and less obvious point is how few\nshort cuts are needed to make the world\nsmall.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1377874) A few sexually active flight\nattendants might be enough.\n\nIn cyberspace, almost everything lies in the shadows. Almost everything is\nconnected, too, and the connectedness comes from a relatively few nodes,\nespecially well linked or especially well trusted. However, it is one thing to\nprove that every node is close to every other node; that does not provide a\nway of finding the path between them. If the gondolier in Venice cannot find\nhis way to the president of the United States, the mathematical existence of\ntheir connection may be small comfort. John Guare understood this, too; the\nnext part of his _Six Degrees of Separation_ explanation is less often quoted:\n\n> > I find that A) tremendously comforting that we’re so close, and B) like\n> Chinese water torture that we’re so close. Because you have to find the\n> right six people to make the connection.\n\nThere is not necessarily an algorithm for that.\n\nThe network has a structure, and that structure stands upon a paradox.\nEverything is close, and everything is far, at the same time. This is why\ncyberspace can feel not just crowded but lonely. You can drop a stone into a\nwell and never hear a splash.\n\nNo deus ex machina waits in the wings; no man behind the curtain. We have no\nMaxwell’s demon to help us filter and search. “We want the Demon, you see,”\nwrote Stanislaw Lem, “to extract from the dance of atoms only information that\nis genuine, like mathematical theorems, fashion magazines, blueprints,\nhistorical chronicles, or a recipe for ion crumpets, or how to clean and iron\na suit of asbestos, and poetry too, and scientific advice, and almanacs, and\ncalendars, and secret documents, and everything that ever appeared in any\nnewspaper in the Universe, and telephone books of the\nfuture.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1378174) As ever, it is the choice that\n_informs_ us (in the original sense of that word). Selecting the genuine takes\nwork; then forgetting takes even more work. This is the curse of omniscience:\nthe answer to any question may arrive at the fingertips—via Google or\nWikipedia or IMDb or YouTube or Epicurious or the National DNA Database or any\nof their natural heirs and successors—and still we wonder what we know.\n\nWe are all patrons of the Library of Babel now, and we are the librarians,\ntoo. We veer from elation to dismay and back. “When it was proclaimed that the\nLibrary contained all books,” Borges tells us, “the first impression was one\nof extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an\nintact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose\neloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was\njustified.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1378449) Then come the lamentations.\nWhat good are the precious books that cannot be found? What good is complete\nknowledge, in its immobile perfection? Borges worries: “The certitude that\neverything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms.” To which,\nJohn Donne had replied long before, “He that desires to print a book, should\nmuch more desire, to be a book.”[](dummy_split_042.html#filepos1378698)\n\nThe library will endure; it is the universe. As for us, everything has not\nbeen written; we are not turning into phantoms. We walk the corridors,\nsearching the shelves and rearranging them, looking for lines of meaning amid\nleagues of cacophony and incoherence, reading the history of the past and of\nthe future, collecting our thoughts and collecting the thoughts of others, and\nevery so often glimpsing mirrors, in which we may recognize creatures of the\ninformation.\n\n\n#  _Acknowledgments_\n\nI am indebted and grateful to Charles H.

TO THROW THE POWERS OF THOUGHT INTO WHEEL-WORK\n\n[1](dummy_split_014.html#filepos205371) The original writings of Charles\nBabbage and, to a lesser extent, Ada Lovelace are increasingly accessible. The\ncomprehensive, thousand-dollar, eleven-volume edition, _The Works of Charles\nBabbage_ , edited by Martin Campbell-Kelly, was published in 1989. Online, the\nfull texts of Babbage’s _Passages from the Life of a Philosopher_ (1864), _On\nthe Economy of Machinery and Manufactures_ (1832), and _The Ninth Bridgewater\nTreatise_ (1838) can now be found in editions scanned from libraries by\nGoogle’s book program. Not yet available there (as of 2010), but also useful,\nis his son’s volume, _Babbage’s Calculating Engines: Being a Collection of\nPapers Relating to Them_ (1889). As interest grew during the era of computing,\nmuch of the useful material in these books was reprinted in collections; most\nvaluable are _Charles Babbage and His Calculating Engines_ , edited by Philip\nMorrison and Emily Morrison (1961); and Anthony Hyman’s _Science and Reform:\nSelected Works of Charles Babbage_ (1989). Other manuscripts were published in\nJ. M. Dubbey, _The Mathematical Work of Charles Babbage_ (1978). The notes\nthat follow refer to one or more of these sources, depending on what seems\nmost useful for the reader. The translation and astounding “notes” on L. F.\nMenabrea’s “Sketch of the Analytical Engine” by Ada Augusta, Countess of\nLovelace, have been made available online at\n<http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html> thanks to John Walker; they are\nalso reproduced in the Morrisons’ collection. As for the Lovelace letters and\npapers, they are in the British Library, the Bodleian, and elsewhere, but many\nhave been published by Betty Alexandra Toole in _Ada: The Enchantress of\nNumbers_ (1992 and 1998); where possible I try to cite the published versions.\n\n[2](dummy_split_015.html#filepos206018) “LIGHT ALMOST SOLAR HAS BEEN\nEXTRACTED”: Charles Babbage, _On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures_\n(1832), 300; reprinted in _Science and Reform: Selected Works of Charles\nBabbage_ , ed.

Special\nacknowledgements are due to the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters and the U.S. Office of Education, who in 1959-1960 provided\nliberal aid to enable the author to pursue research in the media of\ncommunication.\n\n\n![Introduction to the First Edition](images/title-first-ed.png)\n\nJames Reston wrote in The New York Times (July 7, 1957):\n\n> A health director ... reported this week that a small mouse, which\n> presumably had been watching television, attacked a little girl and her\n> full-grown cat.... Both mouse and cat survived, and the incident is recorded\n> here as a reminder that things seem to be changing.\n\nAfter three thousand years of explosion, by means of fragmentary and\nmechanical technologies, the Western world is imploding. During the mechanical\nages we had extended our bodies in space. Today, after more than a century of\nelectric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a\nglobal embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is\nconcerned. Rapidly, we approach the final phase of the extensions of man — the\ntechnological simulation of consciousness, when the creative process of\nknowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human\nsociety, much as we have already extended our senses and our nerves by the\nvarious media. Whether the extension of consciousness, so long sought by\nadvertisers for specific products, will be \"“a good thing”\" is a question that\nadmits of a wide solution. There is little possibility of answering such\nquestions about the extensions of man without considering all of them\ntogether. Any extension, whether of skin, hand, or foot, affects the whole\npsychic and social complex.\n\nSome of the principal extensions, together with some of their psychic and\nsocial consequences, are studied in this book. Just how little consideration\nhas been given to such matters in the past can be gathered from the\nconsternation of one of the editors of this book. He noted in dismay that\n\"“seventy-five per cent of your material is new. A successful book cannot\nventure to be more than ten per cent new.”\" Such a risk seems quite worth\ntaking at the present time when the stakes are very high, and the need to\nunderstand the effects of the extensions of man becomes more urgent by the\nhour.\n\nIn the mechanical age now receding, many actions could be taken without too\nmuch concern. Slow movement insured that the reactions were delayed for\nconsiderable periods of time. Today the action and the reaction occur almost\nat the same time. We actually live mythically and integrally, as it were, but\nwe continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the\npre-electric age.\n\nWestern man acquired from the technology of literacy the power to act without\nreacting. The advantages of fragmenting himself in this way are seen in the\ncase of the surgeon who would be quite helpless if he were to become humanly\ninvolved in his operation. We acquired the art of carrying out the most\ndangerous social operations with complete detachment. But our detachment was a\nposture of noninvolvement. In the electric age, when our central nervous\nsystem is technologically extended to involve us in the whole of mankind and\nto incorporate the whole of mankind in us, we necessarily participate, in\ndepth, in the consequences of our every action. It is no longer possible to\nadopt the aloof and dissociated role of the literate Westerner.\n\nThe Theater of the Absurd dramatizes this recent dilemma of Western man, the\nman of action who appears not to be involved in the action. Such is the origin\nand appeal of Samuel Beckett’s clowns. After three thousand years of\nspecialist explosion and of increasing specialism and alienation in the\ntechnological extensions of our bodies, our world has become compressional by\ndramatic reversal. As electrically contracted, the globe is no more than a\nvillage. Electric speed in bringing all social and political functions\ntogether in a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness of\nresponsibility to an intense degree. It is this implosive factor that alters\nthe position of the Negro, the teenager, and some other groups. They can no\nlonger be _contained_ , in the political sense of limited association. They\nare now _involved_ in our lives, as we in theirs, thanks to the electric\nmedia.\n\nThis is the Age of Anxiety for the reason of the electric implosion that\ncompels commitment and participation, quite regardless of any \"“point of\nview.”\" The partial and specialized character of the viewpoint, however noble,\nwill not serve at all in the electric age. At the information level the same\nupset has occurred with the substitution of the inclusive image for the mere\nviewpoint. If the nineteenth century was the age of the editorial chair, ours\nis the century of the psychiatrist’s couch. As extension of man the chair is a\nspecialist ablation of the posterior, a sort of ablative absolute of backside,\nwhereas the couch extends the integral being. The psychiatrist employs the\ncouch, since it removes the temptation to express private points of view and\nobviates the need to rationalize events.\n\nThe aspiration of our time for wholeness, empathy and depth of awareness is a\nnatural adjunct of electric technology. The age of mechanical industry that\npreceded us found vehement assertion of private outlook the natural mode of\nexpression. Every culture and every age has its favorite model of perception\nand knowledge that it is inclined to prescribe for everybody and everything.\nThe mark of our time is its revulsion against imposed patterns. We are\nsuddenly eager to have things and people declare their beings totally. There\nis a deep faith to be found in this new attitude — a faith that concerns the\nultimate harmony of all being. Such is the faith in which this book has been\nwritten. It explores the contours of our own extended beings in our\ntechnologies, seeking the principle of intelligibility in each of them. In the\nfull confidence that it is possible to win an understanding of these forms\nthat will bring them into orderly service, I have looked at them anew,\naccepting very little of the conventional wisdom concerning them. One can say\nof media as Robert Theobald[1](end-notes.xhtml#n1) has said of economic\ndepressions: \"“There is one additional factor that has helped control\ndepressions, and that is a better understanding of their development.”\"\nExamination of the origin and development of the individual extensions of man\nshould be preceded by a look at some general aspects of the media, or\nextensions of man, beginning with the never-explained numbness that each\nextension brings about in the individual and society.\n\n![Introduction to the Second Edition](images/title-second-ed.png)\n\nJack Paar mentioned that he once had said to a young friend, \"“Why do you kids\nuse ‘cool’ to mean ‘hot’?”\" The friend replied, \"“Because you folks used up\nthe word ‘hot’ before we came along.”\" It is true that “cool” is often used\nnowadays to mean what used to be conveyed by “hot.” Formerly a “hot argument”\nmeant one in which people were deeply involved. On the other hand, a “cool\nattitude” used to mean one of detached objectivity and disinterestedness. In\nthose days the word “disinterested” meant a noble quality of fairmindedness.\nSuddenly it got to mean “couldn’t care less.” The word “hot” has fallen into\nsimilar disuse as these deep changes of outlook have developed. But the slang\nterm “cool” conveys a good deal besides the old idea of “hot.” It indicates a\nkind of commitment and participation in situations that involves all of one’s\nfaculties. In that sense, one can say that automation is cool, whereas the\nolder mechanical kinds of specialist or fragmented “jobs” are “square.” The\n“square” person and situation are not “cool” because they manifest little of\nthe habit of depth involvement of our faculties. The young now say, \"“Humor is\nnot cool.”\" Their favorite jokes bear this out. They ask, \"“What is purple and\nhums?”\" Answer, \"“An electric grape.”\" \"“Why does it hum?”\" Answer, \"“Because\nit doesn’t know the words.”\" Humor is presumably not “cool” because it\ninclines us to laugh at something, instead of getting us emphatically involved\nin something. The story line is dropped from “cool” jokes and “cool” movies\nalike. The Bergman and Fellini movies demand far more involvement than do\nnarrative shows. A story line encompasses a set of events much like a melodic\nline in music. Melody, the _melos modos_ , \"“the road round,”\" is a\ncontinuous, connected, and repetitive structure that is not used in the “cool”\nart of the Orient. The art and poetry of Zen create involvement by means of\nthe interval, not by the _connection_ used in the visually organized Western\nworld. Spectator becomes artist in oriental art because he must supply all the\nconnections.\n\nThe section on “media hot and cool” confused many reviewers of Understanding\nMedia who were unable to recognize the very large structural changes in human\noutlook that are occurring today. Slang offers an immediate index to changing\nperception. Slang is based not on theories but on immediate experience. The\nstudent of media will not only value slang as a guide to changing perception,\nbut he will also study media as bringing about new perceptual habits.\n\nThe section on \"“the medium is the message”\" can, perhaps, be clarified by\npointing out that any technology gradually creates a totally new human\nenvironment. Environments are not passive wrappings but active processes. In\nhis splendid work Preface to Plato (Harvard University Press, 1963), Eric\nHavelock contrasts the oral and written cultures of the Greeks. By Plato’s\ntime the written word had created a new environment that had begun to\ndetribalize man. Previously the Greeks had grown up by benefit of the process\nof the _tribal encyclopedia_. They had memorized the poets. The poets provided\nspecific operational wisdom for all the contingencies of life — Ann Landers in\nverse. With the advent of individual detribalized man, a new education was\nneeded. Plato devised such a new program for literate men. It was based on the\nIdeas. With the phonetic alphabet, classified wisdom took over from the\noperational wisdom of Homer and Hesiod and the tribal encyclopedia. Education\nby classified data has been the Western program ever since.\n\nNow, however, in the electronic age, data classification yields to pattern\nrecognition, the key phrase at IBM. When data move instantly, classification\nis too fragmentary. In order to cope with data at electric speed in typical\nsituations of “information overload,” men resort to the study of\nconfigurations, like the sailor in Edgar Allan Poe’s Maelstrom. The drop-out\nsituation in our schools at present has only begun to develop. The young\nstudent today grows up in an electrically configured world. It is a world not\nof wheels but of circuits, not of fragments but of integral patterns. The\nstudent today _lives_ mythically and in depth. At school, however, he\nencounters a situation organized by means of classified information. The\nsubjects are unrelated. They are visually conceived in terms of a blueprint.\nThe student can find no possible means of involvement for himself, nor can he\ndiscover how the educational scene relates to the “mythic” world of\nelectronically processed data and experience that he takes for granted. As one\nIBM executive puts it, \"“My children had lived several lifetimes compared to\ntheir grandparents when they began grade one.”\"\n\n\"“The medium is the message”\" means, in terms of the electronic age, that a\ntotally new environment has been created. The “content” of this new\nenvironment is the old mechanized environment of the industrial age. The new\nenvironment reprocesses the old one as radically as TV is reprocessing the\nfilm. For the “content” of TV is the movie. TV is environmental and\nimperceptible, like all environments. We are aware only of the “content” or\nthe old environment. When machine production was new, it gradually created an\nenvironment whose content was the old environment of agrarian life and the\narts and crafts. This older environment was elevated to an art form by the new\nmechanical environment. The machine turned Nature into an art form. For the\nfirst time men began to regard Nature as a source of aesthetic and spiritual\nvalues. They began to marvel that earlier ages had been so unaware of the\nworld of Nature as Art. Each new technology creates an environment that is\nitself regarded as corrupt and degrading. Yet the new one turns its\npredecessor into an art form. When writing was new, Plato transformed the old\noral dialogue into an art form. When printing was new the Middle Ages became\nan art form. \"“The Elizabethan world view”\" was a view of the Middle Ages. And\nthe industrial age turned the Renaissance into an art form as seen in the work\nof Jacob Burckhardt. Siegfried Giedion, in turn, has in the electric age\ntaught us how to see the entire process of mechanization as an art process.\n(Mechanization Takes Command)\n\nAs our proliferating technologies have created a whole series of new\nenvironments, men have become aware of the arts as “anti-environments” or\n“counter-environments” that provide us with the means of perceiving the\nenvironment itself. For, as Edward T. Hall has explained in The Silent\nLanguage, men are never aware of the ground rules of their environmental\nsystems or cultures. Today technologies and their consequent environments\nsucceed each other so rapidly that one environment makes us aware of the next.\nTechnologies begin to perform the function of art in making us aware of the\npsychic and social consequences of technology.\n\nArt as anti-environment becomes more than ever a means of training perception\nand judgment. Art offered as a consumer commodity rather than as a means of\ntraining perception is as ludicrous and snobbish as always. Media study at\nonce opens the doors of perception. And here it is that the young can do top-\nlevel research work. The teacher has only to invite the student to do as\ncomplete an inventory as possible. Any child can list the effects of the\ntelephone or the radio or the motor car in shaping the life and work of his\nfriends and his society. An inclusive list of media effects opens many\nunexpected avenues of awareness and investigation.\n\nEdmund Bacon, of the Philadelphia town-planning commission, discovered that\nschool children could be invaluable researchers and colleagues in the task of\nremaking the image of the city. We are entering the new age of education that\nis programmed for discovery rather than instruction. As the means of input\nincrease, so does the need for insight or pattern recognition. The famous\nHawthorne experiment, at the General Electric plant near Chicago, revealed a\nmysterious effect years ago. No matter how the conditions of the workers were\naltered, the workers did more and better work. Whether the heat and light and\nleisure were arranged adversely or pleasantly, the quantity and quality of\noutput improved. The testers gloomily concluded that testing distorted the\nevidence. They missed the all-important fact that when the workers are\npermitted to join their energies to a process of learning and discovery, the\nincreased efficiency is phenomenal.\n\nEarlier it was mentioned how the school drop-out situation will get very much\nworse because of the frustration of the student need for participation in the\nlearning process. This situation concerns also the problem of \"“the culturally\ndisadvantaged child.”\" This child exists not only in the slums but\nincreasingly in the suburbs of the upper-income homes. The culturally\ndisadvantaged child is the TV child. For TV has provided a new environment of\nlow visual orientation and high involvement that makes accommodation to our\nolder educational establishment quite difficult. One strategy of cultural\nresponse would be to raise the visual level of the TV image to enable the\nyoung student to gain access to the old visual world of the classroom and the\ncurriculum. This would be worth trying as a temporary expedient. But TV is\nonly one component of the electric environment of instant circuitry that has\nsucceeded the old world of the wheel and nuts and bolts. We would be foolish\nnot to ease our transition from the fragmented visual world of the existing\neducational establishment by every possible means.\n\nThe existential philosophy, as well as the Theater of the Absurd, represents\nanti-environments that point to the critical pressures of the new electric\nenvironment. Jean-Paul Sartre, as much as Samuel Beckett and Arthur Miller,\nhas declared the futility of blueprints and classified data and “jobs” as a\nway out. Even the words “escape” and “vicarious living” have dwindled from the\nnew scene of electronic involvement. TV engineers have begun to explore the\nbraille-like character of the TV image as a means of enabling the blind to see\nby having this image projected directly onto their skins. We need to use all\nmedia in this wise, to enable us to see our situation.\n\nIn Chapter One there are some lines from Romeo and Juliet whimsically modified\nto make an allusion to TV. Some reviewers have imagined that this was an\ninvoluntary mis-quotation.\n\nThe power of the arts to anticipate future social and technological\ndevelopments, by a generation and more, has long been recognized. In this\ncentury Ezra Pound called the artist \"“the antennae of the race.”\" Art as\nradar acts as \"“an early alarm system,”\" as it were, enabling us to discover\nsocial and psychic targets in lots of time to prepare to cope with them. This\nconcept of the arts as prophetic, contrasts with the popular idea of them as\nmere self-expression. If art is an “early warning system,” to use the phrase\nfrom World War II, when radar was new, art has the utmost relevance not only\nto media study but to the development of media controls.\n\nWhen radar was new it was found necessary to eliminate the balloon system for\ncity protection that had preceded radar. The balloons got in the way of the\nelectric feedback of the new radar information. Such may well prove to be the\ncase with much of our existing school curriculum, to say nothing of the\ngenerality of the arts. We can afford to use only those portions of them that\nenhance the perception of our technologies, and their psychic and social\nconsequences. Art as a radar environment takes on the function of\nindispensable perceptual training rather than the role of a privileged diet\nfor the elite. While the arts as radar feedback provide a dynamic and changing\ncorporate image, their purpose may be not to enable us to change but rather to\nmaintain an even course toward permanent goals, even amidst the most\ndisrupting innovations. We have already discovered the futility of changing\nour goals as often as we change our technologies.\n\n  *[IBM]: International Business Machines\n\n\n![Part 1](images/title-part-1.png)\n\n![The Medium is the Message](images/title-1.png)\n\nIn a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things\nas a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that,\nin operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. This is merely\nto say that the personal and social consequences of any medium — that is, of\nany extension of ourselves — result from the new scale that is introduced into\nour affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology. Thus,\nwith automation, for example, the new patterns of human association tend to\neliminate jobs, it is true. That is the negative result. Positively,\nautomation creates roles for people, which is to say depth of involvement in\ntheir work and human association that our preceding mechanical technology had\ndestroyed. Many people would be disposed to say that it was not the machine,\nbut what one did with the machine, that was its meaning or message. In terms\nof the ways in which the machine altered our relations to one another and to\nourselves, it mattered not in the least whether it turned our cornflakes or\nCadillacs. The restructuring of human work and association was shaped by the\ntechnique of fragmentation that is the essence of machine technology. The\nessence of automation technology is the opposite. It is integral and\ndecentralist in depth, just as the machine was fragmentary, centralist, and\nsuperficial in its patterning of human relationships.\n\nThe instance of the electric light may prove illuminating in this connection.\nThe electric light is pure information. It is a medium without a message, as\nit were, unless it is used to spell out some verbal ad or name. This fact,\ncharacteristic of all media, means that the “content” of any medium is always\nanother medium. The content of writing is speech, just as the written word is\nthe content of print, and print is the content of the telegraph. If it is\nasked, “What is the content of speech?” it is necessary to say, “It is an\nactual process of thought, which is in itself nonverbal.” An abstract painting\nrepresents direct manifestation of creative thought processes as they might\nappear in computer designs. What we are considering here, however, are the\npsychic and social consequences of the designs or patterns as they amplify or\naccelerate existing processes. For the “message” of any medium or technology\nis the change of scale or pace or pattern that it introduces into human\naffairs. The railway did not introduce movement or transportation or wheel or\nroad into human society, but it accelerated and enlarged the scale of previous\nhuman functions, creating totally new kinds of cities and new kinds of work\nand leisure. This happened whether the railway functioned in a tropical or a\nnorthern environment, and is quite independent of the freight or content of\nthe railway medium. The airplane, on the other hand, by accelerating the rate\nof transportation, tends to dissolve the railway form of city, politics, and\nassociation, quite independently of what the airplane is used for.\n\nLet us return to the electric light. Whether the light is being used for brain\nsurgery or night baseball is a matter of indifference. It could be argued that\nthese activities are in some way the “content” of the electric light, since\nthey could not exist without the electric light. This fact merely underlines\nthe point that “the medium is the message” because it is the medium that\nshapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action. The\ncontent or uses of such media are as diverse as they are ineffectual in\nshaping the form of human association. Indeed, it is only too typical that the\n“content” of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium. It is only\ntoday that industries have become aware of the various kinds of business in\nwhich they are engaged. When IBM discovered that it was not in the business of\nmaking office equipment or business machines, but that it was in the business\nof processing information, then it began to navigate with clear vision. The\nGeneral Electric Company makes a considerable portion of its profits from\nelectric light bulbs and lighting systems. It has not yet discovered that,\nquite as much as AT&T, it is in the business of moving information.\n\nThe electric light escapes attention as a communication medium just because it\nhas no “content.” And this makes it an invaluable instance of how people fail\nto study media at all. For it is not till the electric light is used to spell\nout some brand name that it is noticed as a medium. Then it is not the light\nbut the “content” (or what is really another medium) that is noticed. The\nmessage of the electric light is like the message of electric power in\nindustry, totally radical, pervasive, and decentralized. For electric light\nand power are separate from their uses, yet they eliminate time and space\nfactors in human association exactly as do radio, telegraph, telephone, and\nTV, creating involvement in depth.\n\nA fairly complete handbook for studying the extensions of man could be made up\nfrom selections from Shakespeare. Some might quibble about whether or not he\nwas referring to TV in these familiar lines from Romeo and Juliet:\n\n> But soft! what light through yonder window breaks?\n>\n> It speaks, and yet says nothing.\n\nIn Othello, which, as much as King Lear, is concerned with the torment of\npeople transformed by illusions, there are these lines that bespeak\nShakespeare’s intuition of the transforming powers of new media:\n\n> Is there not charms\n>\n> By which the property of youth and maidhood\n>\n> May be abus’d? Have you not read Roderigo,\n>\n> Of some such thing?\n\nIn Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida, which is almost completely devoted to\nboth a psychic and social study of communication, Shakespeare states his\nawareness that true social and political navigation depend upon anticipating\nthe consequences of innovation:\n\n> The providence that’s in a watchful state\n>\n> Knows almost every grain of Plutus’ gold,\n>\n> Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,\n>\n> Keeps place with thought, and almost like the gods\n>\n> Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.\n\nThe increasing awareness of the action of media, quite independently of their\n“content” or programming, was indicated in the annoyed and anonymous stanza:\n\n> In modern thought, (if not in fact)\n>\n> Nothing is that doesn’t act,\n>\n> So that is reckoned wisdom which\n>\n> Describes the scratch but not the itch.\n\nThe same kind of total, configurational awareness that reveals why the medium\nis socially the message has occurred in the most recent and radical medical\ntheories. In his Stress of Life, Hans Selye[2](end-notes.xhtml#n2) tells of\nthe dismay of a research colleague on hearing of Selye’s theory:\n\n> When he saw me thus launched on yet another enraptured description of what I\n> had observed in animals treated with this or that impure, toxic material, he\n> looked at me with desperately sad eyes and said in obvious despair: \"“But\n> Selye, try to realize what you are doing before it is too late! You have now\n> decided to spend your entire life studying the pharmacology of dirt!”\"\n>\n> (Hans Selye, The Stress of Life)\n\nAs Selye deals with the total environmental situation in his “stress” theory\nof disease, so the latest approach to media study considers not only the\n“content” but the medium and the cultural matrix within which the particular\nmedium operates. The older unawareness of the psychic and social effects of\nmedia can be illustrated from almost any of the conventional pronouncements.\n\nIn accepting an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame a few years\nago, General David Sarnoff made this statement: \"“We are too prone to make\ntechnological instruments the scapegoats for the sins of those who wield them.\nThe products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the\nway they are used that determines their value.”\" That is the voice of the\ncurrent somnambulism. Suppose we were to say, “Apple pie is in itself neither\ngood nor bad; it is the way it is used that determines its value.” Or, “The\nsmallpox virus is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used\nthat determines its value.” Again, “Firearms are in themselves neither good\nnor bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.” That is, if\nthe slugs reach the right people firearms are good. If the TV tube fires the\nright ammunition at the right people it is good. I am not being perverse.\nThere is simply nothing in the Sarnoff statement that will bear scrutiny, for\nit ignores the nature of the medium, of any and all media, in the true\nNarcissus style of one hypnotized by the amputation and extension of his own\nbeing in a new technical form. General Sarnoff went on to explain his attitude\nto the technology of print, saying that it was true that print caused much\ntrash to circulate, but it had also disseminated the Bible and the thoughts of\nseers and philosophers. It has never occurred to General Sarnoff that any\ntechnology could do anything but _add_ itself on to what we already are.\n\nSuch economists as Robert Theobald, W. W. Rostow, and John Kenneth Galbraith\nhave been explaining for years how it is that “classical economics” cannot\nexplain change or growth. And the paradox of mechanization is that although it\nis itself the cause of maximal growth and change, the principle of\nmechanization excludes the very possibility of growth or the understanding of\nchange. For mechanization is achieved by fragmentation of any process and by\nputting the fragmented parts in a series. Yet, as David Hume showed in the\neighteenth century, there is no principle of causality in a mere sequence.\nThat one thing follows another accounts for nothing. Nothing follows from\nfollowing, except change. So the greatest of all reversals occurred with\nelectricity, that ended sequence by making things instant. With instant speed\nthe causes of things began to emerge to awareness again, as they had not done\nwith things in sequence and in concatenation accordingly. Instead of asking\nwhich came first, the chicken or the egg, it suddenly seemed that a chicken\nwas an egg’s idea for getting more eggs.\n\nJust before an airplane breaks the sound barrier, sound waves become visible\non the wings of the plane. The sudden visibility of sound just as sound ends\nis an apt instance of that great pattern of being that reveals new and\nopposite forms just as the earlier forms reach their peak performance.\nMechanization was never so vividly fragmented or sequential as in the birth of\nthe movies, the moment that translated us beyond mechanism into the world of\ngrowth and organic interrelation. The movie, by sheer speeding up the\nmechanical, carried us from the world of sequence and connections into the\nworld of creative configuration and structure. The message of the movie medium\nis that of transition from lineal connections to configurations. It is the\ntransition that produced the now quite correct observation: “If it works, it’s\nobsolete.” When electric speed further takes over from mechanical movie\nsequences, then the lines of force in structures and in media become loud and\nclear. We return to the inclusive form of the icon.\n\nTo a highly literate and mechanized culture the movie appeared as a world of\ntriumphant illusions and dreams that money could buy. It was at this moment of\nthe movie that cubism occurred, and it has been described by E. H. Gombrich\n(Art and Illusion) as \"“the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity and to\nenforce one reading of the picture — that of a man-made construction, a\ncolored canvas.”\" For cubism substitutes all facets of an object\nsimultaneously for the “point of view” or facet of perspective illusion.\nInstead of the specialized illusion of the third dimension on canvas, cubism\nsets up an interplay of planes and contradiction or dramatic conflict of\npatterns, lights, textures that “drives home the message” by involvement. This\nis held by many to be an exercise in painting, not in illusion.\n\nIn other words, cubism, by giving the inside and outside, the top, bottom,\nback, and front and the rest, in two dimensions, drops the illusion of\nperspective in favor of instant sensory awareness of the whole. Cubism, by\nseizing on instant total awareness, suddenly announced that the _medium is the\nmessage_. Is it not evident that the moment that the sequence yields to the\nsimultaneous, one is in the world of the structure and of configuration? Is\nthat not what has happened in physics as in painting, poetry, and in\ncommunication? Specialized segments of attention have shifted to total field,\nand we can now say, “The medium is the message” quite naturally. Before the\nelectric speed and total field, it was not obvious that that medium is the\nmessage. The message, it seemed, was the “content,” as people used to ask what\na painting was _about_. Yet they never thought to ask what a melody was about,\nnor what a house or a dress was about. In such matters, people retained some\nsense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity. But in the\nelectric age this integral idea of structure and configuration has become so\nprevalent that educational theory has taken up the matter. Instead of working\nwith specialized “problems” in arithmetic, the structural approach now follows\nthe line of force in the field of number and has small children meditating\nabout number theory and “sets.”\n\nCardinal Newman said of Napoleon, \"“He understood the grammar of gunpowder.”\"\nNapoleon had paid some attention to other media as well, especially the\nsemaphore telegraph that gave him a great advantage over his enemies. He is on\nrecord for saying that \"“Three hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a\nthousand bayonets.”\"\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville was the first to master the grammar of print and\ntypography. He was thus able to read off the message of coming change in\nFrance and America as if he were reading aloud from a text that had been\nhanded to him. In fact, the nineteenth century in France and in America was\njust such an open book to de Tocqueville because he had learned the grammar of\nprint. So he, also, knew when that grammar did not apply. He was asked why he\ndid not write a book on England, since he knew and admired England. He\nreplied:\n\n> One would have to have an unusual degree of philosophical folly to believe\n> oneself able to judge England in six months.

Frenchmen were the same kind of\npeople from north to south. The typographic principles of uniformity,\ncontinuity, and lineality had overlaid the complexities of ancient feudal and\noral society. The Revolution was carried out by the new literati and lawyers.\n\nIn England, however, such was the power of the ancient oral traditions of\ncommon law, backed by the medieval institution of Parliament, that no\nuniformity or continuity of the new visual print culture could take complete\nhold. The result was that the most important event in English history has\nnever taken place; namely, the English Revolution on the lines of the French\nRevolution. The American Revolution had no medieval legal institutions to\ndiscard or to root out, apart from monarchy. And many have held that the\nAmerican Presidency has become very much more personal and monarchical than\nany European monarch ever could be.\n\nDe Tocqueville’s contrast between England and America is clearly based on the\nfact of typography and of print culture creating uniformity and continuity.\nEngland, he says, has rejected this principle and clung to the dynamic or oral\ncommon-law tradition. Hence the discontinuity and unpredictable quality of\nEnglish culture. The grammar of print cannot help to construe the message of\noral and nonwritten culture and institutions. The English aristocracy was\nproperly classified as barbarian by Matthew Arnold because its power and\nstatus had nothing to do with literacy or with the cultural forms of\ntypography. Said the Duke of Gloucester to Edward Gibbon upon the publication\nof his Decline and Fall: \"“Another damned fat book, eh, Mr. Gibbon? Scribble,\nscribble, scribble, eh, Mr. Gibbon?”\" De Tocqueville was a highly literate\naristocrat who was quite able to be detached from the values and assumptions\nof typography. That is why he alone understood the grammar of typography. And\nit is only on those terms, standing aside from any structure or medium, that\nits principles and lines of force can be discerned. For any medium has the\npower of imposing its own assumption on the unwary. Prediction and control\nconsist in avoiding this subliminal state of Narcissus trance. But the\ngreatest aid to this end is simply in knowing that the spell can occur\nimmediately upon contact, as in the first bars of a melody.\n\nA Passage to India by E. M. Forster is a dramatic study of the inability of\noral and intuitive oriental culture to meet with the rational, visual European\npatterns of experience. “Rational,” of course, has for the West long meant\n“uniform and continuous and sequential.” In other words, we have confused\nreason with literacy, and rationalism with a single technology. Thus in the\nelectric age man seems to the conventional West to become irrational. In\nForster’s novel the moment of truth and dislocation from the typographic\ntrance of the West comes in the Marabar Caves. Adela Quested’s reasoning\npowers cannot cope with the total inclusive field of resonance that is India.\nAfter the Caves: \"“Life went on as usual, but had no consequences, that is to\nsay, sounds did not echo nor thought develop. Everything seemed cut off at its\nroot and therefore infected with illusion.”\"\n\nA Passage to India (the phrase is from Whitman, who saw America headed\nEastward) is a parable of Western man in the electric age, and is only\nincidentally related to Europe or the Orient. The ultimate conflict between\nsight and sound, between written and oral kinds of perception and organization\nof existence is upon us. Since understanding stops action, as Nietzsche\nobserved, we can moderate the fierceness of this conflict by understanding the\nmedia that extend us and raise these wars within and without us.\n\nDetribalization by literacy and its traumatic effects on tribal man is the\ntheme of a book by the psychiatrist J. C. Carothers, The African Mind in\nHealth and Disease (World Health Organization, Geneva, 1953). Much of his\nmaterial appeared in an article in Psychiatry magazine, November, 1959: “The\nCulture, Psychiatry, and the Written Word.” Again, it is electric speed that\nhas revealed the lines of force operating from Western technology in the\nremotest areas of bush, savannah, and desert. One example is the Bedouin with\nhis battery radio on board the camel. Submerging natives with floods of\nconcepts for which nothing has prepared them is the normal action of all our\ntechnology. But with electric media Western man himself experiences exactly\nthe same inundation as the remote native. We are no more prepared to encounter\nradio and TV in our literate milieu than the native of Ghana is able to cope\nwith the literacy that takes him out of his collective tribal world and\nbeaches him in individual isolation. We are as numb in our new electric world\nas the native involved in our literate and mechanical culture.\n\nElectric speed mingles the cultures of prehistory with the dregs of industrial\nmarketeers, the nonliterate with the semi-literate and the postliterate.\nMental breakdown of varying degrees is the very common result of uprooting and\ninundation with new information and endless new patterns of information.\nWyndham Lewis made this a theme of his group of novels called The Human Age.\nThe first of these, The Childermass, is concerned precisely with accelerated\nmedia change as a kind of massacre of the innocents. In our own world as we\nbecome more aware of the effects of technology on psychic formation and\nmanifestation, we are losing all confidence in our right to assign guilt.\nAncient prehistoric societies regard violent crime as pathetic. The killer is\nregarded as we do a cancer victim. “How terrible it must be to feel like\nthat,” they say. J. M. Synge took up this idea very effectively in his Playboy\nof the Western World.\n\nIf the criminal appears as a nonconformist who is unable to meet the demand of\ntechnology that we behave in uniform and continuous patterns, literate man is\nquite inclined to see others who cannot conform as somewhat pathetic.\nEspecially the child, the cripple, the woman, and the colored person appear in\na world of visual and typographic technology as victims of injustice. On the\nother hand, in a culture that assigns roles instead of jobs to people—the\ndwarf, the skew, the child create their own spaces. They are not expected to\nfit into some uniform and repeatable niche that is not their size anyway.\nConsider the phrase “It’s a man’s world.” As a quantitative observation\nendlessly repeated from within a homogenized culture, this phrase refers to\nthe men in such a culture who have to be homogenized Dagwoods in order to\nbelong at all. It is in our I.Q. testing that we have produced the greatest\nflood of misbegotten standards. Unaware of our typographic cultural bias, our\ntesters assume that uniform and continuous habits are a sign of intelligence,\nthus eliminating the ear man and the tactile man.\n\nC. P. Snow, reviewing a book of A. L. Rowse (The New York Times Book Review,\nDecember 24, 1961) on Appeasement and the road to Munich, describes the top\nlevel of British brains and experience in the 1930s. \"“Their I.Q.’s were much\nhigher than usual among political bosses. Why were they such a disaster?”\" The\nview of Rowse, Snow approves: \"“They would not listen to warnings because they\ndid not wish to hear.”\" Being anti-Red made it impossible for them to read the\nmessage of Hitler. But their failure was as nothing compared to our present\none. The American stake in literacy as a technology or uniformity applied to\nevery level of education, government, industry, and social life is totally\nthreatened by the electric technology. The threat of Stalin or Hitler was\nexternal. The electric technology is within the gates, and we are numb, deaf,\nblind and mute about its encounter with the Gutenberg technology, on and\nthrough which the American way of life was formed. It is, however, no time to\nsuggest strategies when the threat has not even been acknowledged to exist. I\nam in the position of Louis Pasteur telling doctors that their greatest enemy\nwas quite invisible, and quite unrecognized by them. Our conventional response\nto all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb\nstance of the technological idiot. For the “content” of a medium is like the\njuicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the\nmind. The effect of the medium is made strong and intense just because it is\ngiven another medium as “content.” The content of a movie is a novel or a play\nor an opera. The effect of the movie form is not related to its program\ncontent. The “content” of writing or print is speech, but the reader is almost\nentirely unaware either of print or of speech.\n\nArnold Toynbee is innocent of any understanding of media as they have shaped\nhistory, but he is full of examples that the student of media can use. At one\nmoment he can seriously suggest that adult education, such as the Workers\nEducational Association in Britain, is a useful counterforce to the popular\npress. Toynbee considers that although all of the oriental societies have in\nour time accepted the industrial technology and its political consequences:\n\"“On the cultural plane, however, there is no uniform corresponding\ntendency.”\" (Somervell, I.267) This is like the voice of the literate man,\nfloundering in a milieu of ads, who boasts, “Personally, I pay no attention to\nads.” The spiritual and cultural reservations that the oriental peoples may\nhave toward our technology will avail them not at all. The effects of\ntechnology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, but alter sense\nratios or patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance. The\nserious artist is the only person able to encounter technology with impunity,\njust because he is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception.\n\nThe operation of the money medium in seventeenth century Japan had effects not\nunlike the operation of typography in the West. The penetration of the money\neconomy, wrote G. B. Sansom (in Japan, Cresset Press, London, 1931) \"“caused a\nslow but irresistible revolution, culminating in the breakdown of feudal\ngovernment and the resumption of intercourse with foreign countries after more\nthan two hundred years of seclusion.”\" Money has reorganized the sense life of\npeoples just because it is an _extension_ of our sense lives. This change does\nnot depend upon approval or disapproval of those living in the society.\n\nArnold Toynbee made one approach to the transforming power of media in his\nconcept of “etherialization,” which he holds to be the principle of\nprogressive simplification and efficiency in any organization or technology.\nTypically, he is ignoring the _effect_ of the challenge of these forms upon\nthe response of our senses. He imagines that it is the response of our\nopinions that is relevant to the effect of media and technology in society, a\n“point of view” that is plainly the result of the typographic spell. For the\nman in a literate and homogenized society ceases to be sensitive to the\ndiverse and discontinuous life of forms. He acquires the illusion of the third\ndimension and the “private point of view” as part of his Narcissus fixation,\nand is quite shut off from Blake’s awareness or that of the Psalmist, that we\nbecome what we behold.\n\nToday when we want to get our bearings in our own culture, and have need to\nstand aside from the bias and pressure exerted by any technical form of human\nexpression, we have only to visit a society where that particular form has not\nbeen felt, or a historical period in which it was unknown. Professor Wilbur\nSchramm made such a tactical move in studying Television in the Lives of Our\nChildren. He found areas where TV had not penetrated at all and ran some\ntests. Since he had made no study of the peculiar nature of the TV image, his\ntests were of “content” preferences, viewing time, and vocabulary counts. In a\nword, his approach to the problem was a literary one, albeit unconsciously so.\nConsequently, he had nothing to report. Had his methods been employed in 1500\na.d. to discover the effects of the printed book in the lives of children or\nadults, he could have found out nothing of the changes in human and social\npsychology resulting from typography. Print created individualism and\nnationalism in the sixteenth century. Program and “content” analysis offer no\nclues to the magic of these media or to their subliminal charge.\n\nLeonard Doob, in his report Communication in Africa, tells of one African who\ntook great pains to listen each evening to the BBC news, even though he could\nunderstand nothing of it. Just to be in the presence of those sounds at 7 p.m.\neach day was important for him. His attitude to speech was like ours to melody\n— the resonant intonation was meaning enough. In the seventeenth century our\nancestors still shared this native’s attitude to the forms of the media, as is\nplain in the following sentiment of the Frenchman Bernard Lam expressed in The\nArt of Speaking (London, 1696):\n\n> ‘Tis an effect of the wisdom of God, who created Man to be happy, that\n> whatever is useful to his conversation (way of life) is agreeable to him …\n> because all victual that conduces to nourishment is relishable, whereas\n> other things that cannot be assimilated and be turned into our substance are\n> insipid. A Discourse cannot be pleasant to the Hearer that is not easie to\n> the Speaker; nor can it be easily pronounced unless it be heard with\n> delight.\n\nHere is an equilibrium theory of human diet and expression such as even now we\nare only striving to work out again for media after centuries of fragmentation\nand specialism.\n\nPope Pius XII was deeply concerned that there be serious study of the media\ntoday. On February 17, 1950, he said:\n\n> It is not an exaggeration to say that the future of modern society and the\n> stability of its inner life depend in large part on the maintenance of an\n> equilibrium between the strength of the techniques of communication and the\n> capacity of the individual’s own reaction.\n\nFailure in this respect has for centuries been typical and total for mankind.\nSubliminal and docile acceptance of media impact has made them prisons without\nwalls for their human users. As A. J. Liebling remarked in his book _The\nPress_ , a man is not free if he cannot see where he is going, even if he has\na gun to help him get there. For each of the media is also a powerful weapon\nwith which to clobber other media and other groups. The result is that the\npresent age has been one of multiple civil wars that are not limited to the\nworld of art and entertainment. In War and Human Progress, Professor J. U. Nef\ndeclared: \"“The total wars of our time have been the result of a series of\nintellectual mistakes …”\"\n\nIf the formative power in the media are the media themselves, that raises a\nhost of large matters that can only be mentioned here, although they deserve\nvolumes. Namely, that technological media are staples or natural resources,\nexactly as are coal and cotton and oil. Anybody will concede that a society\nwhose economy is dependent upon one or two major staples like cotton, or\ngrain, or lumber, or fish, or cattle is going to have some obvious social\npatterns of organization as a result. Stress on a few major staples creates\nextreme instability in the economy but great endurance in the population. The\npathos and humor of the American South are embedded in such an economy of\nlimited staples. For a society configured by reliance on a few commodities\naccepts them as a social bond quite as much as the metropolis does the press.\nCotton and oil, like radio and TV, become “fixed charges” on the entire\npsychic life of the community. And this pervasive fact creates the unique\ncultural flavor of any society. It pays through the nose and all its other\nsenses for each staple that shapes its life.\n\nThat our human senses, of which all media are extensions, are also fixed\ncharges on our personal energies, and that they also configure the awareness\nand experience of each one of us, may be perceived in another connection\nmentioned by the psychologist C. G. Jung:\n\n> Every Roman was surrounded by slaves. The slave and his psychology flooded\n> ancient Italy, and every Roman became inwardly, and of course unwittingly, a\n> slave. Because living constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became\n> infected through the unconscious with their psychology. No one can shield\n> himself from such an influence (Contributions to Analytical Psychology,\n> London, 1928).\n  *[IBM]: International Business Machines\n  *[AT&T]: American Telephone & Telegraph\n  *[I.Q.]: Intelligence Quotient\n\n\n![Media Hot and Cold](images/title-2.png)\n\n\"“The rise of the waltz,”\" explained Curt Sachs in the World History of Dance,\n\"“was the result of that longing for truth, simplicity, closeness to nature,\nand primitivism, which the last two-thirds of the eighteenth century\nfulfilled.”\" In the century of jazz we are likely to overlook the emergence of\nthe waltz as a hot and explosive human expression that broke through the\nformal feudal barriers of courtly and choral dance styles.\n\nThere is a basic principle that distinguishes a hot medium like radio from a\ncool one like the telephone, or a hot medium like the movie from a cool one\nlike TV. A hot medium is one that extends one single sense in “high\ndefinition.” High definition is the state of being well filled with data. A\nphotograph is, visually, “high definition.” A cartoon is “low definition,”\nsimply because very little visual information is provided. Telephone is a cool\nmedium, or one of low definition, because the ear is given a meager amount of\ninformation. And speech is a cool medium of low definition, because so little\nis given and so much has to be filled in by the listener. On the other hand,\nhot media do not leave so much to be filled in or completed by the audience.\nHot media are, therefore, low in participation, and cool media are high in\nparticipation or completion by the audience. Naturally, therefore, a hot\nmedium like radio has very different effects on the user from a cool medium\nlike the telephone.\n\nA cool medium like hieroglyphic or ideogrammic written characters has very\ndifferent effects from the hot and explosive medium of the phonetic alphabet.\nThe alphabet, when pushed to a high degree of abstract visual intensity,\nbecame typography. The printed word with its specialist intensity burst the\nbonds of medieval corporate guilds and monasteries, creating extreme\nindividualist patterns of enterprise and monopoly. But the typical reversal\noccurred when extremes of monopoly brought back the corporation, with its\nimpersonal empire over many lives. The hotting-up of the medium of writing to\nrepeatable print intensity led to nationalism and the religious wars of the\nsixteenth century. The heavy and unwieldy media, such as stone, are time\nbinders. Used for writing, they are very cool indeed, and serve to unify the\nages; whereas paper is a hot medium that serves to unify spaces horizontally,\nboth in political and entertainment empires.\n\nAny hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture\nmakes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than\ndialogue. With print many earlier forms were excluded from life and art, and\nmany were given strange new intensity. But our own time is crowded with\nexamples of the principle that the hot form excludes, and the cool one\nincludes. When ballerinas began to dance on their toes a century ago, it was\nfelt that the art of the ballet had acquired a new “spirituality.” With this\nnew intensity, male figures were excluded from ballet. The role of women had\nalso become fragmented with the advent of industrial specialism and the\nexplosion of home functions into laundries, bakeries and hospitals on the\nperiphery of the community. Intensity or high definition engenders specialism\nand fragmentation in living as in entertainment, which explains why any\nintense experience must be “forgotten,” “censored,” and reduced to a very cool\nstate before it can be “learned” or assimilated. The Freudian “censor” is less\nof a moral function than an indispensable condition of learning. Were we to\naccept fully and directly every shock to our various structures of awareness,\nwe would soon be nervous wrecks, doing double-takes and pressing panic buttons\nevery minute. The “censor” protects our central system of values, as it does\nour physical nervous system by simply cooling off the onset of experience a\ngreat deal. For many people, this cooling system brings on a life-long state\nof psychic _rigor mortis_ , or of somnambulism, particularly observable in\nperiods of new technology.\n\nAn example of the disruptive impact of a hot technology succeeding a cool one\nis given by Robert Theobald in The Rich and the Poor. When Australian natives\nwere given steel axes by the missionaries, their culture, based on the stone\naxe, collapsed. The stone axe had not only been scarce but had always been a\nbasic status symbol of male importance. The missionaries provided quantities\nof sharp steel axes and gave them to women and children. The men had even to\nborrow these from the women, causing a collapse of male dignity. A tribal and\nfeudal hierarchy of traditional kind collapses quickly when it meets any hot\nmedium of the mechanical, uniform, and repetitive kind. The medium of money or\nwheel or writing, or any other form of specialist speedup of exchange and\ninformation, will serve to fragment a tribal structure. Similarly, a very much\ngreater speedup, such as occurs with electricity, may serve to restore a\ntribal pattern of intense involvement such as took place with the introduction\nof radio in Europe, and is now tending to happen as a result of TV in America.\nSpecialist technologies detribalize. The nonspecialist electric technology\nretribalizes. The process of upset resulting from a new distribution of skills\nis accompanied by much culture lag in which people feel compelled to look at\nnew situations as if they were old ones, and come up with ideas of “population\nexplosion” in an age of implosion. Newton, in an age of clocks, managed to\npresent the physical universe in the image of a clock. But poets like Blake\nwere far ahead of Newton in their response to the challenge of the clock.\nBlake spoke of the need to be delivered \"“from single vision and Newton’s\nsleep,”\" knowing very well that Newton’s response to the challenge of the new\nmechanism was itself merely a mechanical repetition of the challenge. Blake\nsaw Newton and Locke and others as hypnotized Narcissus types quite unable to\nmeet the challenge of mechanism. W. B. Yeats gave the full Blakean version of\nNewton and Locke in a famous epigram:\n\n> Locke sank into a swoon;\n>\n> The garden died;\n>\n> God took the spinning jenny\n>\n> Out of his side.\n\nYeats presents Locke, the philosopher of mechanical and lineal associationism,\nas hypnotized by his own image. The “garden,” or unified consciousness, ended.\nEighteenth century man got an extension of himself in the form of the spinning\nmachine that Yeats endows with its full sexual significance. Woman, herself,\nis thus seen as a technological extension of man’s being.\n\nBlake’s counterstrategy for his age was to meet mechanism with organic myth.\nToday, deep in the electric age, organic myth is itself a simple and automatic\nresponse capable of mathematical formulation and expression, without any of\nthe imaginative perception of Blake about it. Had he encountered the electric\nage, Blake would not have met its challenge with a mere repetition of electric\nform. For myth is the instant vision of a complex process that ordinarily\nextends over a long period. Myth is contraction or implosion of any process,\nand the instant speed of electricity confers the mythic dimension on ordinary\nindustrial and social action today. We _live_ mythically but continue to think\nfragmentarily and on single planes.\n\nScholars today are acutely aware of a discrepancy between their ways of\ntreating subjects and the subject itself. Scriptural scholars of both the Old\nand New Testaments frequently say that while their treatment must be linear,\nthe subject is not. The subject treats of the relations between God and man,\nand between God and the world, and of the relations between man and his\nneighbor — all these subsist together, and act and react upon one another at\nthe same time. The Hebrew and Eastern mode of thought tackles problem and\nresolution, at the outset of a discussion, in a way typical of oral societies\nin general. The entire message is then traced and retraced, again and again,\non the rounds of a concentric spiral with seeming redundancy. One can stop\nanywhere after the first few sentences and have the full message, if one is\nprepared to “dig” it. This kind of plan seems to have inspired Frank Lloyd\nWright in designing the Guggenheim Art Gallery on a spiral, concentric basis.\nIt is a redundant form inevitable to the electric age, in which the concentric\npattern is imposed by the instant quality, and overlay in depth, of electric\nspeed. But the concentric with its endless intersection of planes is necessary\nfor insight. In fact, it is the technique of insight, and as such is necessary\nfor media study, since no medium has its meaning or existence alone, but only\nin constant interplay with other media.\n\nThe new electric structuring and configuring of life more and more encounters\nthe old lineal and fragmentary procedures and tools of analysis from the\nmechanical age. More and more we turn from the content of messages to study\ntotal effect. Kenneth Boulding put this matter in The Image by saying, \"“The\nmeaning of a message is the change which it produces in the image.”\" Concern\nwith _effect_ rather than _meaning_ is a basic change of our electric time,\nfor effect involves the total situation, and not a single level of information\nmovement. Strangely, there is recognition of this matter of effect rather than\ninformation in the British idea of libel: \"“The greater the truth, the greater\nthe libel.”\"\n\nThe effect of electric technology had at first been anxiety. Now it appears to\ncreate boredom. We have been through the three stages of alarm, resistance,\nand exhaustion that occur in every disease or stress of life, whether\nindividual or collective. At least our exhausted slump after the first\nencounter with the electric has inclined us to expect new problems. However,\nbackward countries that have experienced little permeation with our own\nmechanical and specialist culture are much better able to confront and to\nunderstand electric technology. Not only have backward and nonindustrial\ncultures no specialist habits to overcome in their encounter with\nelectromagnetism, but they have still much of their traditional oral culture\nthat has the total, unified “field” character of our new electromagnetism. Our\nold industrialized areas, having eroded their oral traditions automatically,\nare in the position of having to rediscover them in order to cope with the\nelectric age.\n\nIn terms of the theme of media hot and cold, backward countries are cool, and\nwe are hot. The “city slicker” is hot, and the rustic is cool. But in terms of\nthe reversal of procedures and values in the electric age, the past mechanical\ntime was hot, and we of the TV age are cool. The waltz was a hot, fast\nmechanical dance suited to the industrial time in its moods of pomp and\ncircumstance. In contrast, the Twist is a cool, involved and chatty form of\nimprovised gesture. The jazz of the period of the hot new media of movie and\nradio was hot jazz. Yet jazz of itself tends to be a casual dialogue form of\ndance quite lacking in the repetitive and mechanical forms of the waltz. Cool\njazz came in quite naturally after the first impact of radio and movie had\nbeen absorbed.\n\nIn the special Russian issue of Life magazine for September 13, 1963, it is\nmentioned that in Russian restaurants and night clubs, \"“though the Charleston\nis tolerated, the Twist is taboo.”\" All this is to say that a country in the\nprocess of industrialization is inclined to regard hot jazz as consistent with\nits developing programs. The cool and involved form of the Twist, on the other\nhand, would strike such a culture at once as retrograde and incompatible with\nits new mechanical stress. The Charleston, with its aspect of a mechanical\ndoll agitated by strings, appears in Russia as an _avant-garde_ form. We, on\nthe other hand, find the _avant-garde_ in the cool and the primitive, with its\npromise of depth involvement and integral expression.\n\nThe “hard” sell and the “hot” line become mere comedy in the TV age, and the\ndeath of all the salesmen at one stroke of the TV axe has turned the hot\nAmerican culture into a cool one that is quite unacquainted with itself.\nAmerica, in fact, would seem to be living through the reverse process that\nMargaret Mead described in Time magazine (September 4, 1954): \"“There are too\nmany complaints about society having to move too fast to keep up with the\nmachine. There is great advantage in moving fast if you move completely, if\nsocial, educational, and recreational changes keep pace. You must change the\nwhole pattern at once and the whole group together — and the people themselves\nmust decide to move.”\"\n\nMargaret Mead is thinking here of change as uniform speedup of motion or a\nuniform hotting-up of temperatures in backward societies. We are certainly\ncoming within conceivable range of a world automatically controlled to the\npoint where we could say, \"“Six hours less radio in Indonesia next week or\nthere will be a great falling off in literary attention.”\" Or, \"“We can\nprogram twenty more hours of TV in South Africa next week to cool down the\ntribal temperature raised by radio last week.”\" Whole cultures could now be\nprogrammed to keep their emotional climate stable in the same way that we have\nbegun to know something about maintaining equilibrium in the commercial\neconomies of the world.\n\nIn the merely personal and private sphere we are often reminded of how changes\nof tone and attitude are demanded of different times and seasons in order to\nkeep situations in hand. British clubmen, for the sake of companionship and\namiability have long excluded the hot topics of religion and politics from\nmention inside the highly participational club. In the same vein, W. H. Auden\nwrote, \"“… this season the man of goodwill will wear his heart up his sleeve,\nnot on it … the honest manly style is today suited only to Iago”\"\n(Introduction to John Betjeman’s Slick But Not Streamlined). In the\nRenaissance, as print technology hotted up the social _milieu_ to a very high\npoint, the gentleman and the courtier (Hamlet-Mercutio style) adopted, in\ncontrast, the casual and cool nonchalance of the playful and superior being.\nThe Iago allusion of Auden reminds us that Iago was the _alter ego_ and\nassistant of the intensely earnest and very non-nonchalant General Othello. In\nimitation of the earnest and forthright general, Iago hotted up his own image\nand wore his heart on his sleeve, until General Othello read him loud and\nclear as “honest Iago,” a man after his own grimly earnest heart.\n\nThroughout The City in History, Lewis Mumford favors the cool or casually\nstructured towns over the hot and intensely filled-in cities. The great period\nof Athens, he feels, was one during which most of the democratic habits of\nvillage life and participation still obtained. Then burst forth the full\nvariety of human expression and exploration such as was later impossible in\nhighly developed urban centers. For the highly developed situation is, by\ndefinition, low in opportunities of participation, and rigorous in its demands\nof specialist fragmentation from those who would control it. For example, what\nis known as “job enlargement” today in business and in management consists in\nallowing the employee more freedom to discover and define his function.\nLikewise, in reading a detective story the reader participates as co-author\nsimply because so much has been left out of the narrative. The open-mesh silk\nstocking is far more sensuous than the smooth nylon, just because the eye must\nact as hand in filling in and completing the image, exactly as in the mosaic\nof the TV image.\n\nDouglas Cater in The Fourth Branch of Government tells how the men of the\nWashington press bureaus delighted to complete or fill in the blank of Calvin\nCoolidge’s personality. Because he was so like a mere cartoon, they felt the\nurge to complete his image for him and his public. It is instructive that the\npress applied the word “cool” to Cal. In the very sense of a cool medium,\nCalvin Coolidge was so lacking in any articulation of data in his public image\nthat there was only one word for him. He was real cool. In the hot 1920s, the\nhot press medium found Cal very cool and rejoiced in his lack of image, since\nit compelled the participation of the press in filling in an image of him for\nthe public. By contrast, F.D.R. was a hot press agent, himself a rival of the\nnewspaper medium and one who delighted in scoring off the press on the rival\nhot medium of radio. Quite in contrast, Jack Paar ran a cool show for the cool\nTV medium, and became a rival for the patrons of the night spots and their\nallies in the gossip columns. Jack Paar’s war with the gossip columnists was a\nweird example of clash between a hot and cold medium such as had occurred with\nthe \"“scandal of the rigged TV quiz shows.”\" The rivalry between the hot press\nand radio media, on one hand, and TV on the other, for the hot ad buck, served\nto confuse and to overheat the issues in the affair that pointlessly involved\nCharles Van Doren.\n\nAn Associated Press story from Santa Monica, California, August 9, 1962,\nreported how\n\n> Nearly 100 traffic violators watched a police traffic accident film today to\n> atone for their violations. Two had to be treated for nausea and shock …\n>\n> Viewers were offered a $5.00 reduction in fines if they agreed to see the\n> movie, Signal 30, made by Ohio State police.\n>\n> It showed twisted wreckage and mangled bodies and recorded the screams of\n> accident victims.\n\nWhether the hot film medium using hot content would cool off the hot drivers\nis a moot point. But it does concern any understanding of media. The effect of\nhot media treatment cannot include much empathy or participation at any time.\nIn this connection an insurance ad that featured Dad in an iron lung\nsurrounded by a joyful family group did more to strike terror into the reader\nthan all the warning wisdom in the world. It is a question that arises in\nconnection with capital punishment. Is a severe penalty the best deterrent to\nserious crime? With regard to the bomb and the cold war, is the threat of\nmassive retaliation the most effective means to peace? Is it not evident in\nevery human situation that is pushed to a point of saturation that some\nprecipitation occurs? When all the available resources and energies have been\nplayed up in an organism or in any structure there is some kind of reversal of\npattern. The spectacle of brutality used as deterrent can brutalize. Brutality\nused in sports may humanize under some conditions, at least. But with regard\nto the bomb and retaliation as deterrent, it is obvious that numbness is the\nresult of any prolonged terror, a fact that was discovered when the fallout\nshelter program was broached. The price of eternal vigilance is indifference.\n\nNevertheless, it makes all the difference whether a hot medium is used in a\nhot or a cool culture. The hot radio medium used in cool or nonliterate\ncultures has a violent effect, quite unlike its effect, say in England or\nAmerica, where radio is felt as entertainment. A cool or low literacy culture\ncannot accept hot media like movies or radio as entertainment. They are, at\nleast, as radically upsetting for them as the cool TV medium has proved to be\nfor our high literacy world.\n\nAnd as for the cool war and the hot bomb scare, the cultural strategy that is\ndesperately needed is humor and play. It is play that cools off the hot\nsituations of actual life by miming them. Competitive sports between Russia\nand the West will hardly serve that purpose of relaxation. Such sports are\ninflammatory, it is plain. And what we consider entertainment or fun in our\nmedia inevitably appears as violent political agitation to a cool culture.\n\nOne way to spot the basic difference between hot and cold media uses is to\ncompare and contrast a broadcast of a symphony performance with a broadcast of\na symphony rehearsal. Two of the finest shows ever released by the CBC were of\nGlenn Gould’s procedure in recording piano recitals, and Igor Stravinsky’s\nrehearsing the Toronto symphony in some of his new work. A cool medium like\nTV, when really used, demands this involvement in process. The neat tight\npackage is suited to hot media, like radio and gramophone. Francis Bacon never\ntired of contrasting hot and cool prose. Writing in “methods” or complete\npackages, he contrasted with writing in aphorisms, or single observations such\nas “Revenge is a kind of wild justice.” The passive consumer wants packages,\nbut those, he suggested, who are concerned in pursuing knowledge and in\nseeking causes will resort to aphorisms, just because they are incomplete and\nrequire participation in depth.\n\nThe principle that distinguishes hot and cold media is perfectly embodied in\nthe folk wisdom: \"“Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses.”\" Glasses\nintensify the outward-going vision, and fill in the feminine image\nexceedingly, Marion the Librarian notwithstanding. Dark glasses, on the other\nhand, create the inscrutable and inaccessible image that invites a great deal\nof participation and completion.\n\nAgain, in a visual and highly literate culture, when we meet a person for the\nfirst time his visual appearance dims out the sound of the name, so that in\nself-defense we add: “How do you spell your name?” Whereas, in an ear culture,\nthe _sound_ of a man’s name is the overwhelming fact, as Joyce knew when he\nsaid in Finnegans Wake, \"“Who gave you that numb?”\" For the name of a man is a\nnumbing blow from which he never recovers.\n\nAnother vantage point from which to test the difference between hot and cold\nmedia is the practical joke. The hot literary medium excludes the practical\nand participant aspect of the joke so completely that Constance Rourke, in her\nAmerican Humor, considers it as no joke at all. To literary people, the\npractical joke with its total physical involvement is as distasteful as the\npun that derails us from the smooth and uniform progress that is typographic\norder. Indeed, to the literary person who is quite unaware of the intensely\nabstract nature of the typographic medium, it is the grosser and participant\nforms of art that seem “hot,” and the abstract and intensely literary form\nthat seems “cool.” \"“You may perceive, Madam,”\" said Dr. Johnson, with a\npugilistic smile, \"“that I am well-bred to a degree of needless\nscrupulosity.”\" And Dr. Johnson was right in supposing that “well-bred” had\ncome to mean a white-shirted stress on attire that rivaled the rigor of the\nprinted page. “Comfort” consists in abandoning a visual arrangement in favor\nof one that permits casual participation of the senses, a state that is\nexcluded when any one sense, but especially the visual sense, is hotted up to\nthe point of dominant command of a situation.\n\nOn the other hand, in experiments in which all outer sensation is withdrawn,\nthe subject begins a furious fill-in or completion of senses that is sheer\nhallucination. So the hotting-up of one sense tends to effect hypnosis, and\nthe cooling of all sense tends to result in hallucination.\n\n  *[F.D.R.]: Franklin Delano Rosevelt\n  *[CBC]: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\n\n\n![Reversal of the Overheated Medium](images/title-3.png)\n\nA headline for June 21, 1963, read:\n\n> Washington-Moscow Hot Line To Open In 60 Days\n>\n> The Times of London Service, Geneva:  \n>  The agreement to establish a direct communication link between Washington\n> and Moscow for emergencies was signed here yesterday by Charles Stelle of\n> the United States and Semyon Tsarapkin of the Soviet Union.…\n>\n> The link, known as the hot line, will be opened within sixty days, according\n> to U.S. officials. It will make use of leased commercial circuits, one cable\n> and the other wireless, using teleprinter equipment.\n\nThe decision to use the hot printed medium in place of the cool,\nparticipational, telephone medium is unfortunate in the extreme. No doubt the\ndecision was prompted by the literary bias of the West for the printed form,\non the ground that it is more impersonal than the telephone. The printed form\nhas quite different implications in Moscow from what it has in Washington. So\nwith the telephone. The Russians’ love of this instrument, so congenial to\ntheir oral traditions, is owing to the rich nonvisual involvement it affords.\nThe Russian uses the telephone for the sort of effects we associate with the\neager conversation of the lapel-gripper whose face is twelve inches away.\n\nBoth telephone and teleprinter as amplifications of the unconscious cultural\nbias of Moscow, on one hand, and of Washington, on the other, are invitations\nto monstrous misunderstandings. The Russian bugs rooms and spies by ear,\nfinding this quite natural. He is outraged by our visual spying, however,\nfinding this quite unnatural.\n\nThe principle that during the stages of their development all things appear\nunder forms opposite to those that they finally present is an ancient\ndoctrine. Interest in the power of things to reverse themselves by evolution\nis evident in a great diversity of observations, sage and jocular. Alexander\nPope wrote:\n\n> Vice is a monster of such frightful mien\n>\n> As to be hated needs but to be seen;\n>\n> But seen too oft, familiar with its face,\n>\n> We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\n\nA caterpillar gazing at the butterfly is supposed to have remarked, \"“Waal,\nyou’ll never catch me in one of those durn things.”\"\n\nAt another level we have seen in this century the changeover from the\ndebunking of traditional myths and legends to their reverent study. As we\nbegin to react in depth to the social life and problems of our global village,\nwe become reactionaries. Involvement that goes with our instant technologies\ntransforms the most “socially conscious” people into conservatives. When\nSputnik had first gone into orbit a schoolteacher asked her second-graders to\nwrite some verse on the subject. One child wrote:\n\n> The stars are so big,\n>\n> The earth is so small,\n>\n> Stay as you are.\n\nWith man his knowledge and the process of obtaining knowledge are of equal\nmagnitude. Our ability to apprehend galaxies and subatomic structures, as\nwell, is a movement of faculties that include and transcend them. The second-\ngrader who wrote the words above _lives_ in a world much vaster than any which\na scientist today has instruments to measure, or concepts to describe. As W.\nB. Yeats wrote of this reversal, \"“The visible world is no longer a reality\nand the unseen world is no longer a dream.”\"\n\nAssociated with this transformation of the real world into science fiction is\nthe reversal now proceeding apace, by which the Western world is going\nEastern, even as the East goes Western. Joyce encoded this reciprocal reverse\nin his cryptic phrase:\n\n> The West shall shake the East awake\n>\n> While ye have the night for morn.\n\nThe title of his Finnegans Wake is a set of multi-leveled puns on the reversal\nby which Western man enters his tribal, or Finn, cycle once more, following\nthe track of the old Finn, but wide awake this time as we re-enter the tribal\nnight. It is like our contemporary consciousness of the Unconscious.\n\nThe stepping-up of speed from the mechanical to the instant electric form\nreverses explosion into implosion. In our present electric age the imploding\nor contracting energies of our world now clash with the old expansionist and\ntraditional patterns of organization. Until recently our institutions and\narrangements, social, political, and economic, had shared a one-way pattern.\nWe still think of it as “explosive,” or expansive; and though it no longer\nobtains, we still talk about the population explosion and the explosion in\nlearning. In fact, it is not the increase of numbers in the world that creates\nour concern with population. Rather, it is the fact that everybody in the\nworld has to live in the utmost proximity created by our electric involvement\nin one another’s lives. In education, likewise, it is not the increase in\nnumbers of those seeking to learn that creates the crisis. Our new concern\nwith education follows upon the changeover to an interrelation in knowledge,\nwhere before the separate subjects of the curriculum had stood apart from each\nother. Departmental sovereignties have melted away as rapidly as national\nsovereignties under conditions of electric speed. Obsession with the older\npatterns of mechanical, one-way expansion from centers to margins is no longer\nrelevant to our electric world. Electricity does not centralize, but\ndecentralizes. It is like the difference between a railway system and an\nelectric grid system: the one requires railheads and big urban centers.\nElectric power, equally available in the farmhouse and the Executive Suite,\npermits any place to be a center, and does not require large aggregations.\nThis reverse pattern appeared quite early in electrical “labor-saving”\ndevices, whether a toaster or washing machine or vacuum cleaner. Instead of\nsaving work, these devices permit everybody to do his own work. What the\nnineteenth century had delegated to servants and housemaids we now do for\nourselves. This principle applies in toto in the electric age. In politics, it\npermits Castro to exist as independent nucleus or center. It would permit\nQuebec to leave the Canadian union in a way quite inconceivable under the\nregime of the railways. The railways require a uniform political and economic\nspace. On the other hand, airplane and radio permit the utmost discontinuity\nand diversity in spatial organization.\n\nToday the great principle of classical physics and economics and political\nscience, namely that of the divisibility of each process, has reversed itself\nby sheer extension into the unified field theory; and automation in industry\nreplaces the divisibility of process with the organic interlacing of all\nfunctions in the complex. The electric tape succeeds the assembly line.\n\nIn the new electric Age of Information and programmed production, commodities\nthemselves assume more and more the character of information, although this\ntrend appears mainly in the increasing advertising budget. Significantly, it\nis those commodities that are most used in social communication, cigarettes,\ncosmetics, and soap (cosmetic removers), that bear much of the burden of the\nupkeep of the media in general. As electric information levels rise, almost\nany kind of material will serve any kind of need or function, forcing the\nintellectual more and more into the role of social command and into the\nservice of production.\n\nIt was Julien Benda’s Great Betrayal that helped to clarify the new situation\nin which the intellectual suddenly holds the whip hand in society. Benda saw\nthat the artists and intellectuals who had long been alienated from power, and\nwho since Voltaire had been in opposition, had now been drafted for service in\nthe highest echelons of decision-making. Their great betrayal was that they\nhad surrendered their autonomy and had become the flunkies of power, as the\natomic physicist at the present moment is the flunky of the war lords.\n\nHad Benda known his history, he would have been less angry and less surprised.\nFor it has always been the role of intelligentsia to act as liaison and as\nmediators between old and new power groups. Most familiar of such groups is\nthe case of the Greek slaves, who were for long the educators and confidential\nclerks of the Roman power. And it is precisely this servile role of the\nconfidential clerk to the tycoon — commercial, military, or political — that\nthe educator has continued to play in the Western world until the present\nmoment. In England “the Angries” were a group of such clerks who had suddenly\nemerged from the lower echelons by the educational escape hatch. As they\nemerged into the upper world of power they found that the air was not at all\nfresh or bracing. But they lost their nerve even quicker than Bernard Shaw\nlost his. Like Shaw, they quickly settled down to whimsy and to the\ncultivation of entertainment values.\n\nIn his Study of History, Toynbee notes a great many reversals of form and\ndynamic, as when, in the middle of the fourth century a.d., the Germans in the\nRoman service began abruptly to be proud of their tribal names and to retain\nthem. Such a moment marked new confidence born of saturation with Roman\nvalues, and it was a moment marked by the complementary Roman swing toward\nprimitive values. (As Americans saturate with European values, especially\nsince TV, they begin to insist upon American coach lamps, hitching posts, and\ncolonial kitchenware as cultural objects.) Just as the barbarians got to the\ntop of the Roman social ladder, the Romans themselves were disposed to assume\nthe dress and manners of tribesmen out of the same frivolous and snobbish\nspirit that attached the French court of Louis XVI to the world of shepherds\nand shepherdesses. It would have seemed a natural moment for the intellectuals\nto have taken over while the governing class was touring Disneyland, as it\nwere. So it must have appeared to Marx and his followers. But they reckoned\nwithout understanding the dynamics of the new media of communication. Marx\nbased his analysis most untimely on the machine, just as the telegraph and\nother implosive forms began to reverse the mechanical dynamic.\n\nThe present chapter is concerned with showing that in any medium or structure\nthere is what Kenneth Boulding calls a \"“break boundary at which the system\nsuddenly changes into another or passes some point of no return in its dynamic\nprocesses.”\" Several such “break boundaries” will be discussed later,\nincluding the one from stasis to motion, and from the mechanical to the\norganic in the pictorial world. One effect of the static photo had been to\nsuppress the conspicuous consumption of the rich, but the effect of the\nspeedup of the photo had been to provide fantasy riches for the poor of the\nentire globe.\n\nToday the road beyond its break boundary turns cities into highways, and the\nhighway proper takes on a continuous urban character. Another characteristic\nreversal after passing a road break boundary is that the country ceases to be\nthe center of all work, and the city ceases to be the center of leisure. In\nfact, improved roads and transport have reversed the ancient pattern and made\ncities the centers of work and the country the place of leisure and\nrecreation.\n\nEarlier, the increase of traffic that came with money and roads had ended the\nstatic tribal state (as Toynbee calls the nomadic food-gathering culture).\nTypical of the reversing that occurs at break boundaries is the paradox that\nnomadic mobile man, the hunter and food-gatherer, is socially static. On the\nother hand, sedentary, specialist man is dynamic, explosive, progressive. The\nnew magnetic or world city will be static and iconic or inclusive.\n\nIn the ancient world the intuitive awareness of break boundaries as points of\nreversal and of no return was embodied in the Greek idea of _hubris_ , which\nToynbee presents in his Study of History, under the head of “The Nemesis of\nCreativity” and “The Reversal of Roles.” The Greek dramatists presented the\nidea of creativity as creating, also, its own kind of blindness, as in the\ncase of Oedipus Rex, who solved the riddle of the Sphinx. It was as if the\nGreeks felt that the penalty for one break-through was a general sealing-off\nof awareness to the total field. In a Chinese work—The Way and Its Power (A.\nWaley translation)—there is a series of instances of the overheated medium,\nthe overextended man or culture, and the peripety or reversal that inevitably\nfollows:\n\n> He who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;\n>\n> He who takes the longest strides does not walk the fastest …\n>\n> He who boasts of what he will do succeeds in nothing;\n>\n> He who is proud of his work achieves nothing that endures.\n\nOne of the most common causes of breaks in any system is the cross-\nfertilization with another system, such as happened to print with the steam\npress, or with radio and movies (that yielded the talkies). Today with\nmicrofilm and micro-cards, not to mention electric memories, the printed word\nassumes again much of the handicraft character of a manuscript. But printing\nfrom movable type was, itself, the major break boundary in the history of\nphonetic literacy, just as the phonetic alphabet had been the break boundary\nbetween tribal and individualist man.\n\nThe endless reversals or break boundaries passed in the interplay of the\nstructures of bureaucracy and enterprise include the point at which\nindividuals began to be held responsible and accountable for their “private\nactions.” That was the moment of the collapse of tribal collective authority.\nCenturies later, when further explosion and expansion had exhausted the powers\nof private action, corporate enterprise invented the idea of Public Debt,\nmaking the individual privately accountable for group action.\n\nAs the nineteenth century heated up the mechanical and dissociative procedures\nof technical fragmentation, the entire attention of men turned to the\nassociative and the corporate. In the first great age of the substitution of\nmachine for human toil Carlyle and the Pre-Raphaelites promulgated the\ndoctrine of Work as a mystical social communion, and millionaires like Ruskin\nand Morris toiled like navvies for esthetic reasons. Marx was an\nimpressionable recipient of these doctrines. Most bizarre of all the reversals\nin the great Victorian age of mechanization and high moral tone is the\ncounter-strategy of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, whose nonsense has proved\nexceedingly durable. While the Lord Cardigans were taking their blood baths in\nthe Valley of Death, Gilbert and Sullivan were announcing that the boundary\nbreak had been passed.\n\n\n![The Gadget Lover: Narcissus as Narcosis](images/title-4.png)\n\nThe Greek myth of Narcissus is directly concerned with a fact of human\nexperience, as the word _Narcissus_ indicates. It is from the Greek word\n_narcosis_ , or numbness. The youth Narcissus mistook his own reflection in\nthe water for another person. This extension of himself by mirror numbed his\nperceptions until he became the servomechanism of his own extended or repeated\nimage. The nymph Echo tried to win his love with fragments of his own speech,\nbut in vain. He was numb. He had adapted to his extension of himself and had\nbecome a closed system.\n\nNow the point of this myth is the fact that men at once become fascinated by\nany extension of themselves in any material other than themselves. There have\nbeen cynics who insisted that men fall deepest in love with women who give\nthem back their own image. Be that as it may, the wisdom of the Narcissus myth\ndoes not convey any idea that Narcissus fell in love with anything he regarded\nas himself. Obviously he would have had very different feelings about the\nimage had he known it was an extension or repetition of himself. It is,\nperhaps, indicative of the bias of our intensely technological and, therefore,\nnarcotic culture that we have long interpreted the Narcissus story to mean\nthat he fell in love with himself, that he imagined the reflection to be\nNarcissus!\n\nPhysiologically there are abundant reasons for an extension of ourselves\ninvolving us in a state of numbness. Medical researchers like Hans Selye and\nAdolphe Jonas hold that all extensions of ourselves, in sickness or in health,\nare attempts to maintain equilibrium. Any extension of ourselves they regard\nas “autoamputation,” and they find that the autoamputative power or strategy\nis resorted to by the body when the perceptual power cannot locate or avoid\nthe cause of irritation. Our language has many expressions that indicate this\nself-amputation that is imposed by various pressures. We speak of “wanting to\njump out of my skin” or of “going out of my mind,” being “driven batty” or\n“flipping my lid.” And we often create artificial situations that rival the\nirritations and stresses of real life under controlled conditions of sport and\nplay.\n\nWhile it was no part of the intention of Jonas and Selye to provide an\nexplanation of human invention and technology, they have given us a theory of\ndisease (discomfort) that goes far to explain why man is impelled to extend\nvarious parts of his body by a kind of autoamputation. In the physical stress\nof superstimulation of various kinds, the central nervous system acts to\nprotect itself by a strategy of amputation or isolation of the offending\norgan, sense, or function. Thus, the stimulus to new invention is the stress\nof acceleration of pace and increase of load. For example, in the case of the\nwheel as an extension of the foot, the pressure of new burdens resulting from\nthe acceleration of exchange by written and monetary media was the immediate\noccasion of the extension or “amputation” of this function from our bodies.\nThe wheel as a counter-irritant to increased burdens, in turn, brings about a\nnew intensity of action by its amplification of a separate or isolated\nfunction (the feet in rotation). Such amplification is bearable by the nervous\nsystem only through numbness or blocking of perception. This is the sense of\nthe Narcissus myth. The young man’s image is a self-amputation or extension\ninduced by irritating pressures. As counter-irritant, the image produces a\ngeneralized numbness or shock that declines recognition. Self-amputation\nforbids self-recognition.\n\nThe principle of self-amputation as an immediate relief of strain on the\ncentral nervous system applies very readily to the origin of the media of\ncommunication from speech to computer.\n\nPhysiologically, the central nervous system, that electric network that\ncoordinates the various media of our senses, plays the chief role. Whatever\nthreatens its function must be contained, localized, or cut off, even to the\ntotal removal of the offending organ. The function of the body, as a group of\nsustaining and protective organs for the central nervous system, is to act as\nbuffers against sudden variations of stimulus in the physical and social\nenvironment. Sudden social failure or shame is a shock that some may “take to\nheart” or that may cause muscular disturbance in general, signaling for the\nperson to withdraw from the threatening situation.\n\nTherapy, whether physical or social, is a counter-irritant that aids in that\nequilibrium of the physical organs which protect the central nervous system.\nWhereas pleasure is a counter-irritant (e.g., sports, entertainment, and\nalcohol), comfort is the removal of irritants. Both pleasure and comfort are\nstrategies of equilibrium for the central nervous system.\n\nWith the arrival of electric technology, man extended, or set outside himself,\na live model of the central nervous system itself. To the degree that this is\nso, it is a development that suggests a desperate and suicidal autoamputation,\nas if the central nervous system could no longer depend on the physical organs\nto be protective buffers against the slings and arrows of outrageous\nmechanism. It could well be that the successive mechanizations of the various\nphysical organs since the invention of printing have made too violent and\nsuperstimulated a social experience for the central nervous system to endure.\n\nIn relation to that only too plausible cause of such development, we can\nreturn to the Narcissus theme. For if Narcissus is numbed by his self-\namputated image, there is a very good reason for the numbness. There is a\nclose parallel of response between the patterns of physical and psychic trauma\nor shock. A person suddenly deprived of loved ones and a person who drops a\nfew feet unexpectedly will both register shock. Both the loss of family and a\nphysical fall are extreme instances of amputations of the self. Shock induces\na generalized numbness or an increased threshold to all types of perception.\nThe victim seems immune to pain or sense.\n\nBattle shock created by violent noise has been adapted for dental use in the\ndevice known as _audiac_. The patient puts on headphones and turns a dial\nraising the noise level to the point that he feels no pain from the drill. The\nselection of a _single_ sense for intense stimulus, or of a single extended,\nisolated, or “amputated” sense in technology, is in part the reason for the\nnumbing effect that technology as such has on its makers and users. For the\ncentral nervous system rallies a response of general numbness to the challenge\nof specialized irritation.\n\nThe person who falls suddenly experiences immunity to all pain or sensory\nstimuli because the central nervous system has to be protected from any\nintense thrust of sensation. Only gradually does he regain normal sensitivity\nto sights and sounds, at which time he may begin to tremble and perspire and\nto react as he would have done if the central nervous system had been prepared\nin advance for the fall that occurred unexpectedly.\n\nDepending on which sense or faculty is extended technologically, or\n“autoamputated,” the “closure” or equilibrium-seeking among the other senses\nis fairly predictable. It is with the senses as it is with color. Sensation is\nalways 100 per cent, and a color is always 100 per cent color. But the ratio\namong the components in the sensation or the color can differ infinitely. Yet\nif sound, for example, is intensified, touch and taste and sight are affected\nat once. The effect of radio on literate or visual man was to reawaken his\ntribal memories, and the effect of sound added to motion pictures was to\ndiminish the role of mime, tactility, and kinesthesis. Similarly, when nomadic\nman turned to sedentary and specialist ways, the senses specialized too. The\ndevelopment of writing and the visual organization of life made possible the\ndiscovery of individualism, introspection and so on.\n\nAny invention or technology is an extension or self-amputation of our physical\nbodies, and such extension also demands new ratios or new equilibriums among\nthe other organs and extensions of the body. There is, for example, no way of\nrefusing to comply with the new sense ratios or sense “closure” evoked by the\nTV image. But the effect of the entry of the TV image will vary from culture\nto culture in accordance with the existing sense ratios in each culture. In\naudile-tactile Europe TV has intensified the visual sense, spurring them\ntoward American styles of packaging and dressing. In America, the intensely\nvisual culture, TV has opened the doors of audile-tactile perception to the\nnon-visual world of spoken languages and food and the plastic arts. As an\nextension and expediter of the sense life, any medium at once affects the\nentire field of the senses, as the Psalmist explained long ago in the 113th\nPsalm:\n\n> Their idols are silver and gold,\n>\n> The work of men’s hands.\n>\n> They have mouths, but they speak not;\n>\n> Eyes they have, but they see not;\n>\n> They have ears, but they hear not;\n>\n> Noses have they, but they smell not;\n>\n> They have hands, but they handle not;\n>\n> Feet have they, but they walk not;\n>\n> Neither speak they through their throat.\n>\n> They that make them shall be like unto them;\n>\n> Yea, every one that trusteth in them.\n\nThe concept of “idol” for the Hebrew Psalmist is much like that of Narcissus\nfor the Greek mythmaker. And the Psalmist insists that the _beholding_ of\nidols, or the use of technology, conforms men to them. \"“They that make them\nshall be like unto them.”\" This is a simple fact of sense “closure.” The poet\nBlake developed the Psalmist’s ideas into an entire theory of communication\nand social change. It is in his long poem of Jerusalem that he explains why\nmen have become what they have beheld. What they have, says Blake, is \"“the\nspectre of the Reasoning Power in Man”\" that has become fragmented and\n\"“separated from Imagination and enclosing itself as in steel.”\" Blake, in a\nword, sees man as fragmented by his technologies. But he insists that these\ntechnologies are self-amputations of our own organs. When so amputated, each\norgan becomes a closed system of great new intensity that hurls man into\n\"“martyrdoms and wars.”\" Moreover, Blake announces as his theme in Jerusalem\nthe organs of perception:\n\n> If Perceptive Organs vary, Objects of Perception seem to vary:\n>\n> If Perceptive Organs close, their Objects seem to close also.\n\nTo behold, use or perceive any extension of ourselves in technological form is\nnecessarily to embrace it. To listen to radio or to read the printed page is\nto accept these extensions of ourselves into our personal system and to\nundergo the “closure” or displacement of perception that follows\nautomatically. It is this continuous embrace of our own technology in daily\nuse that puts us in the Narcissus role of subliminal awareness and numbness in\nrelation to these images of ourselves. By continuously embracing technologies,\nwe relate ourselves to them as servomechanisms. That is why we must, to use\nthem at all, serve these objects, these extensions of ourselves, as gods or\nminor religions. An Indian is the servo-mechanism of his canoe, as the cowboy\nof his horse or the executive of his clock.\n\nPhysiologically, man in the normal use of technology (or his variously\nextended body) is perpetually modified by it and in turn finds ever new ways\nof modifying his technology. Man becomes, as it were, the sex organs of the\nmachine world, as the bee of the plant world, enabling it to fecundate and to\nevolve ever new forms. The machine world reciprocates man’s love by expediting\nhis wishes and desires, namely, in providing him with wealth. One of the\nmerits of motivation research has been the revelation of man’s sex relation to\nthe motor car.\n\nSocially, it is the accumulation of group pressures and irritations that\nprompt invention and innovation as counter-irritants. War and the fear of war\nhave always been considered the main incentives to technological extension of\nour bodies. Indeed, Lewis Mumford, in his The City in History, considers the\nwalled city itself an extension of our skins, as much as housing and clothing.\nMore even than the preparation for war, the aftermath of invasion is a rich\ntechnological period; because the subject culture has to adjust all its sense\nratios to accommodate the impact of the invading culture. It is from such\nintensive hybrid exchange and strife of ideas and forms that the greatest\nsocial energies are released, and from which arise the greatest technologies.\nBuckminster Fuller estimates that since 1910 the governments of the world have\nspent 3.5 trillion dollars on airplanes. That is 62 times the existing gold\nsupply of the world.\n\nThe principle of numbness comes into play with electric technology, as with\nany other. We have to numb our central nervous system when it is extended and\nexposed, or we will die. Thus the age of anxiety and of electric media is also\nthe age of the unconscious and of apathy. But it is strikingly the age of\nconsciousness of the unconscious, in addition. With our central nervous system\nstrategically numbed, the tasks of conscious awareness and order are\ntransferred to the physical life of man, so that for the first time he has\nbecome aware of technology as an extension of his physical body. Apparently\nthis could not have happened before the electric age gave us the means of\ninstant, total field-awareness. With such awareness, the subliminal life,\nprivate and social, has been hoicked up into full view, with the result that\nwe have “social consciousness” presented to us as a cause of guilt-feelings.\nExistentialism offers a philosophy of structures, rather than categories, and\nof total social involvement instead of the bourgeois spirit of individual\nseparateness or points of view. In the electric age we wear all mankind as our\nskin.\n\n\n![Hybrid Energy les liaisons dangereuses](images/title-5.png)\n\n\"“For most of our lifetime civil war has been raging in the world of art and\nentertainment.… Moving pictures, gramophone records, radio, talking\npictures.…”\" This is the view of Donald McWhinnie, analyst of the radio\nmedium. Most of this civil war affects us in the depths of our psychic lives,\nas well, since the war is conducted by forces that are extensions and\namplifications of our own beings. Indeed, the interplay among media is only\nanother name for this “civil war” that rages in our society and our psyches\nalike. \"“To the blind all things are sudden,”\" it has been said. The crossings\nor hybridizations of the media release great new force and energy as by\nfission or fusion. There need be no blindness in these matters once we have\nbeen notified that there is anything to observe.\n\nIt has now been explained that media, or the extensions of man, are “make\nhappen” agents, but not “make aware” agents. The hybridizing or compounding of\nthese agents offers an especially favorable opportunity to notice their\nstructural components and properties. \"“As the silent film cried out for\nsound, so does the sound film cry out for color,”\" wrote Sergei Eisenstein in\nhis Notes of a Film Director. This type of observation can be extended\nsystematically to all media: \"“As the printing press cried out for\nnationalism, so did the radio cry out for tribalism.”\" These media, being\nextensions of ourselves, also depend upon us for their interplay and their\nevolution. The fact that they do interact and spawn new progeny has been a\nsource of wonder over the ages. It need baffle us no longer if we trouble to\nscrutinize their action. We can, if we choose, think things out before we put\nthem out.\n\nPlato, in all his striving to imagine an ideal training school, failed to\nnotice that Athens was a greater school than any university even he could\ndream up. In other words, the greatest school had been put out for human use\nbefore it had been thought out. Now, this is especially true of our media.\nThey are put out long before they are thought out. In fact, their being put\noutside us tends to cancel the possibility of their being thought of at all.\n\nEverybody notices how coal and steel and cars affect the arrangements of daily\nexistence. In our time, study has finally turned to the medium of language\nitself as shaping the arrangements of daily life, so that society begins to\nlook like a linguistic echo or repeat of language norms, a fact that has\ndisturbed the Russian Communist party very deeply. Wedded as they are to\nnineteenth-century industrial technology as the basis of class liberation,\nnothing could be more subversive of the Marxian dialectic than the idea that\nlinguistic media shape social development, as much as do the means of\nproduction.\n\nIn fact, of all the great hybrid unions that breed furious release of energy\nand change, there is none to surpass the meeting of literate and oral\ncultures. The giving to man of an eye for an ear by phonetic literacy is,\nsocially and politically, probably the most radical explosion that can occur\nin any social structure. This explosion of the eye, frequently repeated in\n“backward areas,” we call Westernization. With literacy now about to hybridize\nthe cultures of the Chinese, the Indians, and the Africans, we are about to\nexperience such a release of human power and aggressive violence as makes the\nprevious history of phonetic alphabet technology seem quite tame.\n\nThat is only the East-side story, for the electric implosion now brings oral\nand tribal ear-culture to the literate West. Not only does the visual,\nspecialist, and fragmented Westerner have now to live in closest daily\nassociation with all the ancient oral cultures of the earth, but his own\nelectric technology now begins to translate the visual or eye man back into\nthe tribal and oral pattern with its seamless web of kinship and\ninterdependence.\n\nWe know from our own past the kind of energy that is released, as by fission,\nwhen literacy explodes the tribal or family unit. What do we know about the\nsocial and psychic energies that develop by electric fusion or implosion when\nliterate individuals are suddenly gripped by an electromagnetic field, such as\noccurs in the new Common Market pressure in Europe? Make no mistake, the\nfusion of people who have known individualism and nationalism is not the same\nprocess as the fission of “backward” and oral cultures that are just coming to\nindividualism and nationalism. It is the difference between the A-bomb and the\nH-bomb. The latter is more violent, by far. Moreover, the products of electric\nfusion are immensely complex, while the products of fission are simple.\nLiteracy creates very much simpler kinds of people than those that develop in\nthe complex web of ordinary tribal and oral societies. For the fragmented man\ncreates the homogenized Western world, while oral societies are made up of\npeople differentiated, not by their specialist skills or visible marks, but by\ntheir unique emotional mixes. The oral man’s inner world is a tangle of\ncomplex emotions and feelings that the Western practical man has long ago\neroded or suppressed within himself in the interest of efficiency and\npracticality.\n\nThe immediate prospect for literate, fragmented Western man encountering the\nelectric implosion within his own culture is his steady and rapid\ntransformation into a complex and depth-structured person emotionally aware of\nhis total interdependence with the rest of human society. Representatives of\nthe older Western individualism are even now assuming the appearance, for good\nor ill, of Al Capp’s General Bull Moose or of the John Birchers, tribally\ndedicated to opposing the tribal. Fragmented, literate, and visual\nindividualism is not possible in an electrically patterned and imploded\nsociety. So what is to be done? Do we dare to confront such facts at the\nconscious level, or is it best to becloud and repress such matters until some\nviolence releases us from the entire burden? For the fate of implosion and\ninterdependence is more terrible for Western man than the fate of explosion\nand independence for tribal man. It may be merely temperament in my own case,\nbut I find some easing of the burden in just understanding and clarifying the\nissues. On the other hand, since consciousness and awareness seem to be a\nhuman privilege, may it not be desirable to extend this condition to our\nhidden conflicts, both private and social?\n\nThe present book, in seeking to understand many media, the conflicts from\nwhich they spring, and the even greater conflicts to which they give rise,\nholds out the promise of reducing these conflicts by an increase of human\nautonomy. Let us now note a few of the effects of media hybrids, or of the\ninterpenetration of one medium by another.\n\nLife at the Pentagon has been greatly complicated by jet travel, for example.\nEvery few minutes an assembly gong rings to summon many specialists from their\ndesks to hear a personal report from an expert from some remote part of the\nworld. Meantime, the undone paper work mounts on each desk. And each\ndepartment daily dispatches personnel by jet to remote areas for more data and\nreports. Such is the speed of this process of the meeting of the jet plane,\nthe oral report, and the typewriter that those going forth to the ends of the\nearth often arrive unable to spell the name of the spot to which they have\nbeen sent as experts. Lewis Carroll pointed out that as large-scale maps got\nmore and more detailed and extensive, they would tend to blanket agriculture\nand rouse the protest of farmers. So why not use the actual earth as a map of\nitself? We have reached a similar point of data gathering when each stick of\nchewing gum we reach for is acutely noted by some computer that translates our\nleast gesture into a new probability curve or some parameter of social\nscience. Our private and corporate lives have become information processes\njust because we have put our central nervous systems outside us in electric\ntechnology. That is the key to Professor Boorstin’s bewilderment in The Image,\nor What Happened to the American Dream.\n\nThe electric light ended the regime of night and day, of indoors and out-of-\ndoors. But it is when the light encounters already existing patterns of human\norganization that the hybrid energy is released. Cars can travel all night,\nball players can play all night, and windows can be left out of buildings. In\na word, the message of the electric light is total change. It is pure\ninformation without any content to restrict its transforming and informing\npower.\n\nIf the student of media will but meditate on the power of this medium of\nelectric light to transform every structure of time and space and work and\nsociety that it penetrates or contacts, he will have the key to the form of\nthe power that is in all media to reshape any lives that they touch. Except\nfor light, all other media come in pairs, with one acting as the “content” of\nthe other, obscuring the operation of both.\n\nIt is a peculiar bias of those who operate media for the owners that they be\nconcerned about the program content of radio, or press, or film. The owners\nthemselves are concerned more about the media as such, and are not inclined to\ngo beyond “what the public wants” or some vague formula. Owners are aware of\nthe media as power, and they know that this power has little to do with\n“content” or the media within the media.\n\nWhen the press opened up the “human interest” keyboard after the telegraph had\nrestructured the press medium, the newspaper killed the theater, just as TV\nhit the movies and the night clubs very hard. George Bernard Shaw had the wit\nand imagination to fight back. He put the press into the theater, taking over\nthe controversies and the human interest world of the press for the stage, as\nDickens had done for the novel. The movie took over the novel and the\nnewspaper and the stage, all at once. Then TV pervaded the movie and gave the\ntheater-in-the-round back to the public.\n\nWhat I am saying is that media as extensions of our senses institute new\nratios, not only among our private senses, but among themselves, when they\ninteract among themselves. Radio changed the form of the news story as much as\nit altered the film image in the talkies. TV caused drastic changes in radio\nprogramming, and in the form of the _thing_ or documentary novel.\n\nIt is the poets and painters who react instantly to a new medium like radio or\nTV. Radio and gramophone and tape recorder gave us back the poet’s voice as an\nimportant dimension of the poetic experience. Words became a kind of painting\nwith light, again. But TV, with its deep-participation mode, caused young\npoets suddenly to present their poems in cafés, in public parks, anywhere.\nAfter TV, they suddenly felt the need for personal contact with their public.\n(In print-oriented Toronto, poetry-reading in the public parks is a public\noffense. Religion and politics are permitted, but not poetry, as many young\npoets recently discovered.)\n\nJohn O’Hara, the novelist, wrote in The New York Times Book Review of November\n27, 1955:\n\n> You get a great satisfaction from a book. You know your reader is captive\n> inside those covers, but as novelist you have to imagine the satisfaction\n> he’s getting. Now, in the theater — well, I used to drop in during both\n> productions of Pal Joey and watch, not imagine, the people enjoy it. I’d\n> willingly start my next novel — about a small town — right now, but I need\n> the diversion of a play.\n\nIn our age artists are able to mix their media diet as easily as their book\ndiet. A poet like Yeats made the fullest use of oral peasant culture in\ncreating his literary effects. Quite early, Eliot made a great impact by the\ncareful use of jazz and film form. The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock gets\nmuch of its power from an interpenetration of film form and jazz idiom. But\nthis mix reached its greatest power in The Waste Land and Sweeney Agonistes.\nPrufrock uses not only film form but the film theme of Charlie Chaplin, as did\nJames Joyce in Ulysses. Joyce’s Bloom is a deliberate takeover from Chaplin\n(“Chorney Choplain,” as he called him in Finnegans Wake). And Chaplin, just as\nChopin had adapted the pianoforte to the style of the ballet, hit upon the\nwondrous media mix of ballet and film in developing his Pavlova-like\nalternation of ecstasy and waddle. He adapted the classical steps of ballet to\na movie mime that converged exactly the right blend of the lyric and the\nironic that is found also in Prufrock and Ulysses. Artists in various fields\nare always the first to discover how to enable one medium to use or to release\nthe power of another. In a simpler form, it is the technique employed by\nCharles Boyer in his kind of French-English blend of urbane, throaty delirium.\n\nThe printed book had encouraged artists to reduce all forms of expression as\nmuch as possible to the single descriptive and narrative plane of the printed\nword. The advent of electric media released art from this straitjacket at\nonce, creating the world of Paul Klee, Picasso, Braque, Eisenstein, the Marx\nBrothers, and James Joyce.\n\nA headline in The New York Times Book Review (September 16, 1962) trills:\nThere's Nothing Like A Best Seller To Set Hollywood A-Tingle.\n\nOf course, nowadays, movie stars can only be lured from the beaches or\nscience-fiction or some self-improvement course by the cultural lure of a role\nin a famous book. That is the way that the interplay of media now affects many\nin the movie colony. They have no more understanding of their media problems\nthan does Madison Avenue. But from the point of view of the owners of the film\nand related media, the best seller is a form of insurance that some massive\nnew _gestalt_ or pattern has been isolated in the public psyche. It is an oil\nstrike or a gold mine that can be depended on to yield a fair amount of boodle\nto the careful and canny processor. Hollywood bankers, that is, are smarter\nthan literary historians, for the latter despise popular taste except when it\nhas been filtered down from lecture course to literary handbook.\n\nLillian Ross in Picture wrote a snide account of the filming of The Red Badge\nof Courage. She got a good deal of easy kudos for a foolish book about a great\nfilm by simply _assuming_ the superiority of the literary medium to the film\nmedium. Her book got much attention as a hybrid.\n\nAgatha Christie wrote far above her usual good level in a group of twelve\nshort stories about Hercule Poirot, called The Labours of Hercules. By\nadjusting the classical themes to make reasonable modern parallels, she was\nable to lift the detective form to extraordinary intensity.\n\nSuch was, also, the method of James Joyce in Dubliners and Ulysses, when the\nprecise classical parallels created the true hybrid energy. Baudelaire, said\nMr. Eliot, \"“taught us how to raise the imagery of common life to first\nintensity.”\" It is done, not by any direct heave-ho of poetic strength, but by\na simple adjustment of situations from one culture in hybrid form with those\nof another. It is precisely in this way that during wars and migrations new\ncultural mix is the norm of ordinary daily life. Operations Research programs\nthe hybrid principle as a technique of creative discovery.\n\nWhen the movie scenario or picture story was applied to the _idea_ article,\nthe magazine world had discovered a hybrid that ended the supremacy of the\nshort story. When wheels were put in tandem form, the wheel principle combined\nwith the lineal typographic principle to create aerodynamic balance. The wheel\ncrossed with industrial, lineal form released the new form of the airplane.\n\nThe hybrid or the meeting of two media is a moment of truth and revelation\nfrom which new form is born. For the parallel between two media holds us on\nthe frontiers between forms that snap us out of the Narcissus-narcosis. The\nmoment of the meeting of media is a moment of freedom and release from the\nordinary trance and numbness imposed by them on our senses.\n\n\n![Media as Translators](images/title-6.png)\n\nThe tendency of neurotic children to lose neurotic traits when telephoning has\nbeen a puzzle to psychiatrists. Some stutterers lose their stutter when they\nswitch to a foreign language. That technologies are ways of translating one\nkind of knowledge into another mode has been expressed by Lyman Bryson in the\nphrase \"“technology is explicitness.”\" Translation is thus a “spelling-out” of\nforms of knowledge. What we call “mechanization” is a translation of nature,\nand of our own natures, into amplified and specialized forms. Thus the quip in\nFinnegans Wake, \"“What bird has done yesterday man may do next year,”\" is a\nstrictly literal observation of the courses of technology. The power of\ntechnology as dependent on alternately grasping and letting go in order to\nenlarge the scope of action has been observed as the power of the higher\narboreal apes as compared with those that are on the ground. Elias Canetti\nmade the proper association of this power of the higher apes to grasp and let\ngo, with the strategy of the stock market speculators. It is all capsulated in\nthe popular variant on Robert Browning: \"“A man’s reach must exceed his grasp\nor what’s a metaphor.”\" All media are active metaphors in their power to\ntranslate experience into new forms. The spoken word was the first technology\nby which man was able to let go of his environment in order to grasp it in a\nnew way. Words are a kind of information retrieval that can range over the\ntotal environment and experience at high speed. Words are complex systems of\nmetaphors and symbols that translate experience into our uttered or outered\nsenses. They are a technology of explicitness. By means of translation of\nimmediate sense experience into vocal symbols the entire world can be evoked\nand retrieved at any instant.\n\nIn this electric age we see ourselves being translated more and more into the\nform of information, moving toward the technological extension of\nconsciousness. That is what is meant when we say that we daily know more and\nmore about man. We mean that we can translate more and more of ourselves into\nother forms of expression that exceed ourselves. Man is a form of expression\nwho is traditionally expected to repeat himself and to echo the praise of his\nCreator. \"“Prayer,”\" said George Herbert, \"“is reversed thunder.”\" Man has the\npower to reverberate the Divine thunder, by verbal translation.\n\nBy putting our physical bodies inside our extended nervous systems, by means\nof electric media, we set up a dynamic by which all previous technologies that\nare mere extensions of hands and feet and teeth and bodily heat-controls — all\nsuch extensions of our bodies, including cities — will be translated into\ninformation systems. Electromagnetic technology requires utter human docility\nand quiescence of meditation such as befits an organism that now wears its\nbrain outside its skull and its nerves outside its hide. Man must serve his\nelectric technology with the same servo-mechanistic fidelity with which he\nserved his coracle, his canoe, his typography, and all other extensions of his\nphysical organs. But there is this difference, that previous technologies were\npartial and fragmentary, and the electric is total and inclusive. An external\nconsensus or conscience is now as necessary as private consciousness. With the\nnew media, however, it is also possible to store and to translate everything;\nand, as for speed, that is no problem. No further acceleration is possible\nthis side of the light barrier.\n\nJust as when information levels rise in physics and chemistry, it is possible\nto use anything for fuel or fabric or building material, so with electric\ntechnology all solid goods can be summoned to appear as solid commodities by\nmeans of information circuits set up in the organic patterns that we call\n“automation” and information retrieval. Under electric technology the entire\nbusiness of man becomes learning and knowing. In terms of what we still\nconsider an “economy” (the Greek word for a household), this means that all\nforms of employment become “paid learning,” and all forms of wealth result\nfrom the movement of information. The problem of discovering occupations or\nemployment may prove as difficult as wealth is easy.\n\nThe long revolution by which men have sought to translate nature into art we\nhave long referred to as “applied knowledge.” “Applied” means translated or\ncarried across from one kind of material form into another. For those who care\nto consider this amazing process of applied knowledge in Western civilization,\nShakespeare’s As You Like It provides a good deal to think about. His Forest\nof Arden is just such a golden world of translated benefits and joblessness as\nwe are now entering via the gate of electric automation.\n\nIt is no more than one would expect that Shakespeare should have understood\nthe Forest of Arden as an advance model of the age of automation when all\nthings are translatable into anything else that is desired:\n\n> And this our life, exempt from public haunt,\n>\n> Finds tongues in trees, books in running brooks,\n>\n> Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.\n>\n> I would not change it.\n>\n> Amiens: Happy is your Grace,\n>\n> That can translate the stubbornness of fortune\n>\n> Into so quiet and so sweet a style.\n>\n> (As You Like It, II, i. 15–21)\n\nShakespeare speaks of a world into which, by programming, as it were, one can\nplay back the materials of the natural world in a variety of levels and\nintensities of style. We are close to doing just this on a massive scale at\nthe present time electronically. Here is the image of the golden age as one of\ncomplete metamorphoses or translations of nature into human art, that stands\nready of access to our electric age. The poet Stéphane Mallarmé thought \"“the\nworld exists to end in a book.”\" We are now in a position to go beyond that\nand to transfer the entire show to the memory of a computer. For man, as\nJulian Huxley observes, unlike merely biological creatures, possesses an\napparatus of transmission and transformation based on his power to store\nexperience. And his power to store, as in a language itself, is also a means\nof transformation of experience:\n\n> Those pearls that were his eyes.\n\nOur dilemma may become like that of the listener who phoned the radio station:\n\"“Are you the station that gives twice as much weather? Well, turn it off. I’m\ndrowning.”\"\n\nOr we might return to the state of tribal man, for whom magic rituals are his\nmeans of “applied knowledge.” Instead of translating nature into art, the\nnative nonliterate attempts to invest nature with spiritual energy.\n\nPerhaps there is a key to some of these problems in the Freudian idea that\nwhen we fail to translate some natural event or experience into conscious art\nwe “repress” it. It is this mechanism that also serves to numb us in the\npresence of those extensions of ourselves that are the media studied in this\nbook. For just as a metaphor transforms and transmits experience, so do the\nmedia. When we say, “I’ll take a rain check on that,” we translate a social\ninvitation into a sporting event, stepping up the conventional regret to an\nimage of spontaneous disappointment: \"“Your invitation is not just one of\nthose casual gestures that I must brush off. It makes me feel all the\nfrustration of an interrupted ball game that I can’t get with it.”\" As in all\nmetaphors, there are complex ratios among four parts: \"“Your invitation is to\nordinary invitations as ball games are to conventional social life.”\" It is in\nthis way that by seeing one set of relations through another set that we store\nand amplify experience in such forms as money. For money is also a metaphor.\nAnd all media as extensions of ourselves serve to provide new transforming\nvision and awareness. \"“It is an excellent invention,”\" Bacon says, \"“that Pan\nor the world is said to make choice of Echo only (above all other speeches or\nvoices) for his wife, for that alone is true philosophy which doth faithfully\nrender the very words of the world …”\"\n\nToday Mark II stands by to render the masterpieces of literature from any\nlanguage into any other language, giving as follows, the words of a Russian\ncritic of Tolstoy about \"“War and World (peace … But nonetheless culture not\nstands) costs on place. Something translate. Something print.”\" (Boorstin,\n141)\n\nOur very word “grasp” or “apprehension” points to the process of getting at\none thing through another, of handling and sensing many facets at a time\nthrough more than one sense at a time. It begins to be evident that “touch” is\nnot skin but the interplay of the senses, and “keeping in touch” or “getting\nin touch” is a matter of a fruitful meeting of the senses, of sight translated\ninto sound and sound into movement, and taste and smell. The “common sense”\nwas for many centuries held to be the peculiar human power of translating one\nkind of experience of one sense into all the senses, and presenting the result\ncontinuously as a unified image to the mind. In fact, this image of a unified\nratio among the senses was long held to be the mark of our _ratio_ nality, and\nmay in the computer age easily become so again. For it is now possible to\nprogram ratios among the senses that approach the condition of consciousness.\nYet such a condition would necessarily be an extension of our own\nconsciousness as much as wheel is an extension of feet in rotation. Having\nextended or translated our central nervous system into the electromagnetic\ntechnology, it is but a further stage to transfer our consciousness to the\ncomputer world as well. Then, at least, we shall be able to program\nconsciousness in such wise that it cannot be numbed nor distracted by the\nNarcissus illusions of the entertainment world that beset mankind when he\nencounters himself extended in his own gimmickry.\n\nIf the work of the city is the remaking or translating of man into a more\nsuitable form than his nomadic ancestors achieved, then might not our current\ntranslation of our entire lives into the spiritual form of information seem to\nmake of the entire globe, and of the human family, a single consciousness?\n\n\n![Challenge and Collapse: The Nemesis of Creativity](images/title-7.png)\n\nIt was Bertrand Russell who declared that the great discovery of the twentieth\ncentury was the technique of the suspended judgment. A. N. Whitehead, on the\nother hand, explained how the great discovery of the nineteenth century was\nthe discovery of the technique of discovery. Namely, the technique of starting\nwith the thing to be discovered and working back, step by step, as on an\nassembly line, to the point at which it is necessary to start in order to\nreach the desired object. In the arts this meant starting with the _effect_\nand then inventing a poem, painting, or building that would have just that\neffect and no other.\n\nBut the \"“technique of the suspended judgment”\" goes further. It anticipates\nthe effect of, say, an unhappy childhood on an adult, and offsets the effect\nbefore it happens. In psychiatry, it is the technique of total permissiveness\nextended as an anesthetic for the mind, while various adhesions and moral\neffects of false judgments are systematically eliminated.\n\nThis is a very different thing from the numbing or narcotic effect of new\ntechnology that lulls attention while the new form slams the gates of judgment\nand perception. For massive social surgery is needed to insert new technology\ninto the group mind, and this is achieved by the built-in numbing apparatus\ndiscussed earlier. Now the \"“technique of the suspended judgment”\" presents\nthe possibility of rejecting the narcotic and of postponing indefinitely the\noperation of inserting the new technology in the social psyche. A new stasis\nis in prospect.\n\nWerner Heisenberg, in The Physicist’s Conception of Nature, is an example of\nthe new quantum physicist whose overall awareness of forms suggests to him\nthat we would do well to stand aside from most of them. He points out that\ntechnical change alters not only habits of life, but patterns of thought and\nvaluation, citing with approval the outlook of the Chinese sage:\n\n> As Tzu-Gung was travelling through the regions north of the river Han, he\n> saw an old man working in his vegetable garden. He had dug an irrigation\n> ditch. The man would descend into a well, fetch up a vessel of water in his\n> arms and pour it out into the ditch. While his efforts were tremendous the\n> results appeared to be very meager.\n>\n> Tzu-Gung said, “There is a way whereby you can irrigate a hundred ditches in\n> one day, and whereby you can do much with little effort. Would you not like\n> to hear of it?”\n>\n> Then the gardener stood up, looked at him and said, “And what would that\n> be?”\n>\n> Tzu-Gung replied, “You take a wooden lever, weighted at the back and light\n> in front. In this way you can bring up water so quickly that it just gushes\n> out. This is called a draw-well.”\n>\n> Then anger rose up in the old man’s face, and he said, “I have heard my\n> teacher say that whoever uses machines does all his work like a machine. He\n> who does his work like a machine grows a heart like a machine, and he who\n> carries the heart of a machine in his breast loses his simplicity. He who\n> has lost his simplicity becomes unsure in the strivings of his soul.\n> Uncertainty in the strivings of the soul is something which does not agree\n> with honest sense. It is not that I do not know of such things; I am ashamed\n> to use them.”\n\nPerhaps the most interesting point about this anecdote is that it appeals to a\nmodern physicist. It would not have appealed to Newton or to Adam Smith, for\nthey were great experts and advocates of the fragmentary and the specialist\napproaches. It is by means quite in accord with the outlook of the Chinese\nsage that Hans Selye works at his “stress” idea of illness. In the 1920s he\nhad been baffled at why physicians always seemed to concentrate on the\nrecognition of individual diseases and specific remedies for such isolated\ncauses, while never paying any attention to the “syndrome of just being sick.”\nThose who are concerned with the program “content” of media and not with the\nmedium proper, appear to be in the position of physicians who ignore the\n\"“syndrome of just being sick.”\" Hans Selye, in tackling a total, inclusive\napproach to the field of sickness, began what Adolphe Jonas has continued in\nIrritation and Counter-Irritation; namely, a quest for the response to injury\nas such, or to novel impact of any kind. Today we have anesthetics that enable\nus to perform the most frightful physical operations on one another.\n\nThe new media and technologies by which we amplify and extend ourselves\nconstitute huge collective surgery carried out on the social body with\ncomplete disregard for antiseptics. If the operations are needed, the\ninevitability of infecting the whole system during the operation has to be\nconsidered. For in operating on society with a new technology, it is not the\nincised area that is most affected. The area of impact and incision is numb.\nIt is the entire system that is changed. The effect of radio is visual, the\neffect of the photo is auditory. Each new impact shifts the ratios among all\nthe senses. What we seek today is either a means of controlling these shifts\nin the sense-ratios of the psychic and social outlook, or a means of avoiding\nthem altogether. To have a disease without its symptoms is to be immune. No\nsociety has ever known enough about its actions to have developed immunity to\nits new extensions or technologies. Today we have begun to sense that art may\nbe able to provide such immunity.\n\nIn the history of human culture there is no example of a conscious adjustment\nof the various factors of personal and social life to new extensions except in\nthe puny and peripheral efforts of artists. The artist picks up the message of\ncultural and technological challenge decades before its transforming impact\noccurs. He, then, builds models or Noah’s arks for facing the change that is\nat hand. \"“The war of 1870 need never have been fought had people read my\nSentimental Education,”\" said Gustave Flaubert.\n\nIt is this aspect of _new_ art that Kenneth Galbraith recommends to the\ncareful study of businessmen who want to stay in business. For in the electric\nage there is no longer any sense in talking about the artist’s being ahead of\nhis time. Our technology is, also, ahead of its time, if we reckon by the\nability to recognize it for what it is. To prevent undue wreckage in society,\nthe artist tends now to move from the ivory tower to the control tower of\nsociety. Just as higher education is no longer a frill or luxury but a stark\nneed of production and operational design in the electric age, so the artist\nis indispensable in the shaping and analysis and understanding of the life of\nforms, and structures created by electric technology.\n\nThe percussed victims of the new technology have invariably muttered clichés\nabout the impracticality of artists and their fanciful preferences. But in the\npast century it has come to be generally acknowledged that, in the words of\nWyndham Lewis, \"“The artist is always engaged in writing a detailed history of\nthe future because he is the only person aware of the nature of the present.”\"\nKnowledge of this simple fact is now needed for human survival. The ability of\nthe artist to sidestep the bully blow of new technology of any age, and to\nparry such violence with full awareness, is age-old. Equally age-old is the\ninability of the percussed victims, who cannot sidestep the new violence, to\nrecognize their need of the artist. To reward and to make celebrities of\nartists can, also, be a way of ignoring their prophetic work, and preventing\nits timely use for survival. The artist is the man in any field, scientific or\nhumanistic, who grasps the implications of his actions and of new knowledge in\nhis own time. He is the man of integral awareness.\n\nThe artist can correct the sense ratios before the blow of new technology has\nnumbed conscious procedures. He can correct them before numbness and\nsubliminal groping and reaction begin. If this is true, how is it possible to\npresent the matter to those who are in a position to do something about it? If\nthere were even a remote likelihood of this analysis being true, it would\nwarrant a global armistice and period of stocktaking. If it is true that the\nartist possesses the means of anticipating and avoiding the consequences of\ntechnological trauma, then what are we to think of the world and bureaucracy\nof “art appreciation?” Would it not seem suddenly to be a conspiracy to make\nthe artist a frill, a fribble, or a Milltown?[3](end-notes.xhtml#n3) If men\nwere able to be convinced that art is precise advance knowledge of how to cope\nwith the psychic and social consequences of the next technology, would they\nall become artists? Or would they begin a careful translation of new art forms\ninto social navigation charts? I am curious to know what would happen if art\nwere suddenly seen for what it is, namely, exact information of how to\nrearrange one’s psyche in order to anticipate the next blow from our own\nextended faculties. Would we, then, cease to look at works of art as an\nexplorer might regard the gold and gems used as the ornaments of simple\nnonliterates?\n\nAt any rate, in experimental art, men are given the exact specifications of\ncoming violence to their own psyches from their own counter-irritants or\ntechnology. For those parts of ourselves that we thrust out in the form of new\ninvention are attempts to counter or neutralize collective pressures and\nirritations. But the counter-irritant usually proves a greater plague than the\ninitial irritant, like a drug habit. And it is here that the artist can show\nus how to “ride with the punch,” instead of “taking it on the chin.” It can\nonly be repeated that human history is a record of “taking it on the chin.”\n\nEmile Durkheim long ago expressed the idea that the specialized task always\nescaped the action of the social conscience. In this regard, it would appear\nthat the artist is the social conscience and is treated accordingly! \"“We have\nno art,”\" say the Balinese, \"“we do everything as well as possible.”\"\n\nThe modern metropolis is now sprawling helplessly after the impact of the\nmotorcar. As a response to the challenge of railway speeds the suburb and the\ngarden city arrived too late, or just in time to become a motorcar disaster.\nFor an arrangement of functions adjusted to one set of intensities becomes\nunbearable at another intensity. And a technological extension of our bodies\ndesigned to alleviate physical stress can bring on psychic stress that may be\nmuch worse. Western specialist technology transferred to the Arab world in\nlate Roman times released a furious discharge of tribal energy.\n\nThe somewhat devious means of diagnosis that have to be used to pin down the\nactual form and impact of a new medium are not unlike those indicated in\ndetective fiction by Peter Cheyney. In You Can’t Keep the Change (Collins,\nLondon, 1956) he wrote:\n\n> A case to Callaghan was merely a collection of people, some of whom — all of\n> whom — were giving incorrect information, or telling lies, because\n> circumstances either forced them or led them into the process.\n>\n> But the fact that they _had_ to tell lies, _had_ to give false impressions,\n> necessitated a reorientation of their own viewpoints and their own lives.\n> Sooner or later they became exhausted or careless. Then, and not until then,\n> was an investigator able to put his finger on the one fact that would lead\n> him to a possible logical solution.\n\nIt is interesting to note that success in keeping up a respectable front of\nthe customary kind can only be done by a frantic scramble back of the façade.\nAfter the crime, after the blow has fallen, the façade of custom can only be\nheld up by swift rearrangement of the props. So it is in our social lives when\na new technology strikes, or in our private life when some intense and,\ntherefore, indigestible experience occurs, and the censor acts at once to numb\nus from the blow and to ready the faculties to assimilate the intruder. Peter\nCheyney’s observations of a mode of detective fiction is another instance of a\npopular form of entertainment functioning as mimic model of the real thing.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious “closure” or psychic consequence of any new\ntechnology is just the demand for it. Nobody wants a motorcar till there are\nmotorcars, and nobody is interested in TV until there are TV programs. This\npower of technology to create its own world of demand is not independent of\ntechnology being first an extension of our own bodies and senses. When we are\ndeprived of our sense of sight, the other senses take up the role of sight in\nsome degree. But the need to use the senses that are available is as insistent\nas breathing — a fact that makes sense of the urge to keep radio and TV going\nmore or less continuously. The urge to continuous use is quite independent of\nthe “content” of public programs or of the private sense life, being testimony\nto the fact that technology is part of our bodies. Electric technology is\ndirectly related to our central nervous systems, so it is ridiculous to talk\nof “what the public wants” played over its own nerves. This question would be\nlike asking people what sort of sights and sounds they would prefer around\nthem in an urban metropolis! Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous\nsystems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from\ntaking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don’t really have any\nrights left. Leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial interests is\nlike handing over the common speech to a private corporation, or like giving\nthe earth’s atmosphere to a company as a monopoly. Something like this has\nalready happened with outer space, for the same reasons that we have leased\nour central nervous systems to various corporations. As long as we adopt the\nNarcissus attitude of regarding the extensions of our own bodies as really\n_out there_ and really independent of us, we will meet all technological\nchallenges with the same sort of banana-skin pirouette and collapse.\n\nArchimedes once said, \"“Give me a place to stand and I will move the world.”\"\nToday he would have pointed to our electric media and said, \"“I will stand on\nyour eyes, your ears, your nerves, and your brain, and the world will move in\nany tempo or pattern I choose.”\" We have leased these “places to stand” to\nprivate corporations.\n\nArnold Toynbee has devoted much of his A Study of History to analyzing the\nkinds of challenge faced by a variety of cultures during many centuries.\nHighly relevant to Western man is Toynbee’s explanation of how the lame and\nthe crippled respond to their handicaps in a society of active warriors. They\nbecome specialists like Vulcan, the smith and armorer. And how do whole\ncommunities act when conquered and enslaved? The same strategy serves them as\nit does the lame individual in a society of warriors. They specialize and\nbecome indispensable to their masters. It is probably the long human history\nof enslavement, and the collapse into specialism as a counter-irritant, that\nhave put the stigma of servitude and pusillanimity on the figure of the\nspecialist, even in modern times. The capitulation of Western man to his\ntechnology, with its crescendo of specialized demands, has always appeared to\nmany observers of our world as a kind of enslavement. But the resulting\nfragmentation has been voluntary and enthusiastic, unlike the conscious\nstrategy of specialism on the part of the captives of military conquest.\n\nIt is plain that fragmentation or specialism as a technique of achieving\nsecurity under tyranny and oppression of any kind has an attendant danger.\nPerfect adaptation to any environment is achieved by a total channeling of\nenergies and vital force that amounts to a kind of static terminus for a\ncreature. Even slight changes in the environment of the very well adjusted\nfind them without any resource to meet new challenge. Such is the plight of\nthe representatives of “conventional wisdom” in any society. Their entire\nstake of security and status is in a single form of acquired knowledge, so\nthat innovation is for them not novelty but annihilation.\n\nA related form of challenge that has always faced cultures is the simple fact\nof a frontier or a wall, on the other side of which exists another kind of\nsociety. Mere existence side by side of any two forms of organization\ngenerates a great deal of tension. Such, indeed, has been the principle of\nsymbolist artistic structures in the past century. Toynbee observes that the\nchallenge of a civilization set side by side with a tribal society has over\nand over demonstrated that the simpler society finds its integral economy and\ninstitutions \"“disintegrated by a rain of psychic energy generated by the\ncivilization”\" of the more complex culture. When two societies exist side by\nside, the psychic challenge of the more complex one acts as an explosive\nrelease of energy in the simpler one. For prolific evidence of this kind of\nproblem it is not necessary to look beyond the life of the teenager lived\ndaily in the midst of a complex urban center. As the barbarian was driven to\nfurious restlessness by the civilized contact, collapsing into mass migration,\nso the teenager, compelled to share the life of a city that cannot accept him\nas an adult, collapses into “rebellion without a cause.” Earlier the\nadolescent had been provided with a rain check. He was prepared to wait it\nout. But since TV, the drive to participation has ended adolescence, and every\nAmerican home has its Berlin wall.\n\nToynbee is very generous in providing examples of widely varied challenge and\ncollapse, and is especially apt in pointing to the frequent and futile resort\nto futurism and archaism as strategies of encountering radical change. But to\npoint back to the day of the horse or to look forward to the coming of anti-\ngravitational vehicles is not an adequate response to the challenge of the\nmotorcar. Yet these two uniform ways of backward and forward looking are\nhabitual ways of avoiding the discontinuities of present experience with their\ndemand for sensitive inspection and appraisal. Only the dedicated artist seems\nto have the power for encountering the present actuality.\n\nToynbee urges again and again the cultural strategy of the imitation of the\nexample of great men. This, of course, is to locate cultural safety in the\npower of the _will_ , rather than in the power of adequate _perception_ of\nsituations. Anybody could quip that this is the British trust in character as\nopposed to intellect. In view of the endless power of men to hypnotize\nthemselves into unawareness in the presence of challenge, it may be argued\nthat willpower is as useful as intelligence for survival. Today we need also\nthe will to be exceedingly informed and aware.\n\nArnold Toynbee gives an example of Renaissance technology being effectively\nencountered and creatively controlled when he shows how the revival of the\ndecentralized medieval parliament saved English society from the monopoly of\ncentralism that seized the continent. Lewis Mumford in The City in History\ntells the strange tale of how the New England town was able to carry out the\npattern of the medieval ideal city because it was able to dispense with walls\nand to mix town and country. When the technology of a time is powerfully\nthrusting in one direction, wisdom may well call for a countervailing thrust.\nThe implosion of electric energy in our century cannot be met by explosion or\nexpansion, but it can be met by decentralism and the flexibility of multiple\nsmall centers. For example, the rush of students into our universities is not\nexplosion but implosion. And the needful strategy to encounter this force is\nnot to enlarge the university, but to create numerous groups of autonomous\ncolleges in place of our centralized university plant that grew up on the\nlines of European government and nineteenth-century industry.\n\nIn the same way the excessive tactile effects of the TV image cannot be met by\nmere program changes. Imaginative strategy based on adequate diagnosis would\nprescribe a corresponding depth or structural approach to the existing\nliterary and visual world. If we persist in a conventional approach to these\ndevelopments our traditional culture will be swept aside as scholasticism was\nin the sixteenth century. Had the Schoolmen with their complex oral culture\nunderstood the Gutenberg technology, they could have created a new synthesis\nof written and oral education, instead of bowing out of the picture and\nallowing the merely visual page to take over the educational enterprise. The\noral Schoolmen did not meet the new visual challenge of print, and the\nresulting expansion or explosion of Gutenberg technology was in many respects\nan impoverishment of the culture, as historians like Mumford are now beginning\nto explain. Arnold Toynbee, in A Study of History, in considering \"“the nature\nof growths of civilizations,”\" not only abandons the concept of enlargement as\na criterion of real growth of society, but states: \"“More often geographical\nexpansion is a concomitant of real decline and coincides with a ‘time of\ntroubles’ or a universal state — both of them stages of decline and\ndisintegration.”\"\n\nToynbee expounds the principle that times of trouble or rapid change produce\nmilitarism, and it is militarism that produces empire and expansion. The old\nGreek myth which taught that the alphabet produced militarism (\"“King Cadmus\nsowed the dragon’s teeth, and they sprang up armed men”\") really goes much\ndeeper than Toynbee’s story. In fact, “militarism” is just vague description,\nnot analysis of causality at all. Militarism is a kind of visual organization\nof social energies that is both specialist and explosive, so that it is merely\nrepetitive to say, as Toynbee does, that it both creates large empires and\ncauses social breakdown. But militarism is a form of industrialism or the\nconcentration of large amounts of homogenized energies into a few kinds of\nproduction. The Roman soldier was a man with a spade. He was an expert workman\nand builder who processed and packaged the resources of many societies and\nsent them home. Before machinery, the only massive work forces available for\nprocessing material were soldiers or slaves. As the Greek myth of Cadmus\npoints out, the phonetic alphabet was the greatest processor of men for\nhomogenized military life that was known to antiquity. The age of Greek\nsociety that Herodotus acknowledges to have been \"“overwhelmed by more\ntroubles than in the twenty preceding generations”\" was the time that to our\nliterary retrospect appears as one of the greatest of human centuries. It was\nMacaulay who remarked that it was not pleasant to live in times about which it\nwas exciting to read. The succeeding age of Alexander saw Hellenism expand\ninto Asia and prepare the course of the later Roman expansion. These, however,\nwere the very centuries in which Greek civilization obviously fell apart.\n\nToynbee points to the strange falsification of history by archeology, insofar\nas the survival of many material objects of the past does not indicate the\nquality of ordinary life and experience at any particular time. Continuous\ntechnical improvement in the means of warfare occurs over the entire period of\nHellenic and Roman decline. Toynbee checks out his hypothesis by testing it\nwith the developments in Greek agriculture. When the enterprise of Solon\nweaned the Greeks from mixed farming to a program of specialized products for\nexport, there were happy consequences and a glorious manifestation of energy\nin Greek life. When the next phase of the same specialist stress involved much\nreliance on slave labor, there was spectacular increase of production. But the\narmies of technologically specialized slaves working the land blighted the\nsocial existence of the independent yeomen and small farmers, and led to the\nstrange world of the Roman towns and cities crowded with rootless parasites.\n\nTo a much greater degree than Roman slavery, the specialism of mechanized\nindustry and market organization has faced Western man with the challenge of\nmanufacture by mono-fracture, or the tackling of all things and operations\none-bit-at-a-time. This is the challenge that has permeated all aspects of our\nlives and enabled us to expand so triumphantly in all directions and in all\nspheres.\n\n\n![Part 2](images/title-part-2.png)\n\n![The Spoken Word: Flower of Evil?](images/title-8.png)\n\nA few seconds from a popular disk-jockey show were typed out as follows:\n\n> That’s Patty Baby and that’s the girl with the dancing feet and that’s\n> Freddy Cannon there on the David Mickie Show in the night time ooohbah\n> scuba-doo how are you booboo. Next we’ll be Swinging on a Star and\n> ssshhhwwoooo and sliding on a moonbeam.\n>\n> Waaaaaaa how about that … one of the goodest guys with you … this is lovable\n> kissable D.M. in the p.m. at 22 minutes past nine o’clock there, aahrightie,\n> we’re gonna have a Hitline, all you have to do is call WAlnut 5-1151, WAlnut\n> 5-1151, tell them what number it is on the Hitline.\n\nDave Mickie alternately soars, groans, swings, sings, solos, intones, and\nscampers, always reacting to his own actions. He moves entirely in the spoken\nrather than the written area of experience. It is in this way that audience\nparticipation is created. The spoken word involves all of the senses\ndramatically, though highly literate people tend to speak as connectedly and\ncasually as possible. The sensuous involvement natural to cultures in which\nliteracy is not the ruling form of experience is sometimes indicated in travel\nguides, as in this item from a guide to Greece:\n\n> You will notice that many Greek men seem to spend a lot of time counting the\n> beads of what appear to be amber rosaries. But these have no religious\n> significance. They are _komboloia_ or “worry beads,” a legacy from the\n> Turks, and Greeks click them on land, on the sea, in the air to ward off\n> that insupportable silence which threatens to reign whenever conversation\n> lags.

And if you wonder why so few Greek women wear beads, you’ll know it’s\n> because their husbands have pre-empted them for the simple pleasure of\n> clicking. More aesthetic than thumb-twiddling, less expensive than smoking,\n> this Queeg-like obsession indicates a tactile sensuousness characteristic of\n> a race which has produced the western world’s greatest sculpture …\n\nWhere the heavy visual stress of literacy is lacking in a culture, there\noccurs another form of sensuous involvement and cultural appreciation that our\nGreek guide explains whimsically:\n\n> … do not be surprised at the frequency with which you are patted, petted and\n> prodded in Greece. You may end up feeling like the family dog … in an\n> affectionate family. This propensity to pat seems to us a tactile extension\n> of the avid Greek curiosity noted before. It’s as though your hosts are\n> trying to find out what you are made of.\n\nThe widely separate characters of the spoken and written words are easy to\nstudy today when there is ever closer touch with nonliterate societies. One\nnative, the only literate member of his group, told of acting as reader for\nthe others when they received letters. He said he felt impelled to put his\nfingers to his ears while reading aloud, so as not to violate the privacy of\ntheir letters. This is interesting testimony to the values of privacy fostered\nby the visual stress of phonetic writing. Such separation of the senses, and\nof the individual from the group, can scarcely occur without the influence of\nphonetic writing. The spoken word does not afford the extension and\namplification of the visual power needed for habits of individualism and\nprivacy.\n\nIt helps to appreciate the nature of the spoken word to contrast it with the\nwritten form. Although phonetic writing separates and extends the visual power\nof words, it is comparatively crude and slow. There are not many ways of\nwriting “tonight,” but Stanislavsky used to ask his young actors to pronounce\nand stress it fifty different ways while the audience wrote down the different\nshades of feeling and meaning expressed. Many a page of prose and many a\nnarrative has been devoted to expressing what was, in effect, a sob, a moan, a\nlaugh, or a piercing scream. The written word spells out in sequence what is\nquick and implicit in the spoken word.\n\nAgain, in speech we tend to react to each situation that occurs, reacting in\ntone and gesture even to our own act of speaking. But writing tends to be a\nkind of separate or specialist action in which there is little opportunity or\ncall for reaction. The literate man or society develops the tremendous power\nof acting in any matter with considerable detachment from the feelings or\nemotional involvement that a nonliterate man or society would experience.\n\nHenri Bergson, the French philosopher, lived and wrote in a tradition of\nthought in which it was and is considered that language is a human technology\nthat has impaired and diminished the values of the collective unconscious. It\nis the extension of man in speech that enables the intellect to detach itself\nfrom the vastly wider reality. Without language, Bergson suggests, human\nintelligence would have remained totally involved in the objects of its\nattention. Language does for intelligence what the wheel does for the feet and\nthe body. It enables them to move from thing to thing with greater ease and\nspeed and ever less involvement. Language extends and amplifies man but it\nalso divides his faculties. His collective consciousness or intuitive\nawareness is diminished by this technical extension of consciousness that is\nspeech.\n\nBergson argues in Creative Evolution that even consciousness is an extension\nof man that dims the bliss of union in the collective unconscious. Speech acts\nto separate man from man, and mankind from the cosmic unconscious. As an\nextension or uttering (outering) of all our senses at once, language has\nalways been held to be man’s richest art form, that which distinguishes him\nfrom the animal creation.\n\nIf the human ear can be compared to a radio receiver that is able to decode\nelectromagnetic waves and recode them as sound, the human voice may be\ncompared to the radio transmitter in being able to translate sound into\nelectromagnetic waves. The power of the voice to shape air and space into\nverbal patterns may well have been preceded by a less specialized expression\nof cries, grunts, gestures, and commands, of song and dance. The patterns of\nthe senses that are extended in the various languages of men are as varied as\nstyles of dress and art. Each mother tongue teaches its users a way of seeing\nand feeling the world, and of acting in the world, that is quite unique.\n\nOur new electric technology that extends our senses and nerves in a global\nembrace has large implications for the future of language. Electric technology\ndoes not need words any more than the digital computer needs numbers.\nElectricity points the way to an extension of the process of consciousness\nitself, on a world scale, and without any verbalization whatever. Such a state\nof collective awareness may have been the preverbal condition of men. Language\nas the technology of human extension, whose powers of division and separation\nwe know so well, may have been the “Tower of Babel” by which men sought to\nscale the highest heavens. Today computers hold out the promise of a means of\ninstant translation of any code or language into any other code or language.\nThe computer, in short, promises by technology a Pentecostal condition of\nuniversal understanding and unity. The next logical step would seem to be, not\nto translate, but to by-pass languages in favor of a general cosmic\nconsciousness which might be very like the collective unconscious dreamt of by\nBergson. The condition of “weightlessness” that biologists say promises a\nphysical immortality, may be paralleled by the condition of speechlessness\nthat could confer a perpetuity of collective harmony and peace.\n\n\n![The Written Word: An Eye for an Ear](images/title-9.png)\n\nPrince Modupe[4](end-notes.xhtml#n4) wrote of his encounter with the written\nword in his West African days:\n\nThe one crowded space in Father Perry’s house was his bookshelves. I gradually\ncame to understand that the marks on the pages were _trapped words_. Anyone\ncould learn to decipher the symbols and turn the trapped words loose again\ninto speech. The ink of the print trapped the thoughts; they could no more get\naway than a _doomboo_ could get out of a pit. When the full realization of\nwhat this meant flooded over me, I experienced the same thrill and amazement\nas when I had my first glimpse of the bright lights of Konakry. I shivered\nwith the intensity of my desire to learn to do this wondrous thing myself.\n\nIn striking contrast to the native’s eagerness, there are the current\nanxieties of civilized man concerning the written word. To some Westerners the\nwritten or printed word has become a very touchy subject. It is true that\nthere is more material written and printed and read today than ever before,\nbut there is also a new electric technology that threatens this ancient\ntechnology of literacy built on the phonetic alphabet. Because of its action\nin extending our central nervous system, electric technology seems to favor\nthe inclusive and participational spoken word over the specialist written\nword. Our Western values, built on the written word, have already been\nconsiderably affected by the electric media of telephone, radio, and TV.\nPerhaps that is the reason why many highly literate people in our time find it\ndifficult to examine this question without getting into a moral panic. There\nis the further circumstance that, during his more than two thousand years of\nliteracy, Western man has done little to study or to understand the effects of\nthe phonetic alphabet in creating many of his basic patterns of culture. To\nbegin now to examine the question may, therefore, seem too late.\n\nSuppose that, instead of displaying the Stars and Stripes, we were to write\nthe words “American flag” across a piece of cloth and to display that. While\nthe symbols would convey the same meaning, the effect would be quite\ndifferent. To translate the rich visual mosaic of the Stars and Stripes into\nwritten form would be to deprive it of most of its qualities of corporate\nimage and of experience, yet the abstract literal bond would remain much the\nsame. Perhaps this illustration will serve to suggest the change the tribal\nman experiences when he becomes literate. Nearly all the emotional and\ncorporate family feeling is eliminated from his relationship with his social\ngroup. He is emotionally free to separate from the tribe and to become a\ncivilized individual, a man of visual organization who has uniform attitudes,\nhabits, and rights with all other civilized individuals.\n\nThe Greek myth about the alphabet was that Cadmus, reputedly the king who\nintroduced the phonetic letters into Greece, sowed the dragon’s teeth, and\nthey sprang up armed men. Like any other myth, this one capsulates a prolonged\nprocess into a flashing insight. The alphabet meant power and authority and\ncontrol of military structures at a distance. When combined with papyrus, the\nalphabet spelled the end of the stationary temple bureaucracies and the\npriestly monopolies of knowledge and power. Unlike pre-alphabetic writing,\nwhich with its innumerable signs was difficult to master, the alphabet could\nbe learned in a few hours. The acquisition of so extensive a knowledge and so\ncomplex a skill as pre-alphabetic writing represented, when applied to such\nunwieldy materials as brick and stone, insured for the scribal caste a\nmonopoly of priestly power. The easier alphabet and the light, cheap,\ntransportable papyrus together effected the transfer of power from the\npriestly to the military class. All this is implied in the myth about Cadmus\nand the dragon’s teeth, including the fall of the city states, the rise of\nempires and military bureaucracies.\n\nIn terms of the extensions of man, the theme of the dragon’s teeth in the\nCadmus myth is of the utmost importance. Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power\nreminds us that the teeth are an obvious agent of power in man, and especially\nin many animals. Languages are filled with testimony to the grasping,\ndevouring power and precision of teeth. That the power of letters as agents of\naggressive order and precision should be expressed as extensions of the\ndragon’s teeth is natural and fitting. Teeth are emphatically visual in their\nlineal order. Letters are not only like teeth visually, but their power to put\nteeth into the business of empire-building is manifest in our Western history.\n\nThe phonetic alphabet is a unique technology. There have been many kinds of\nwriting, pictographic and syllabic, but there is only one phonetic alphabet in\nwhich semantically meaningless letters are used to correspond to semantically\nmeaningless sounds. This stark division and parallelism between a visual and\nan auditory world was both crude and ruthless, culturally speaking. The\nphonetically written word sacrifices worlds of meaning and perception that\nwere secured by forms like the hieroglyph and the Chinese ideogram. These\nculturally richer forms of writing, however, offered men no means of sudden\ntransfer from the magically discontinuous and traditional world of the tribal\nword into the hot and uniform visual medium. Many centuries of ideogrammic use\nhave not threatened the seamless web of family and tribal subtleties of\nChinese society. On the other hand, a single generation of alphabetic literacy\nsuffices in Africa today, as in Gaul two thousand years ago, to release the\nindividual initially, at least, from the tribal web. This fact has nothing to\ndo with the _content_ of the alphabetized words; it is the result of the\nsudden breach between the auditory and the visual experience of man. Only the\nphonetic alphabet makes such a sharp division in experience, giving to its\nuser an eye for an ear, and freeing him from the tribal trance of resonating\nword magic and the web of kinship.\n\nIt can be argued, then, that the phonetic alphabet, alone, is the technology\nthat has been the means of creating “civilized man” — the separate individuals\nequal before a written code of law. Separateness of the individual, continuity\nof space and of time, and uniformity of codes are the prime marks of literate\nand civilized societies. Tribal cultures like those of the Indian and the\nChinese may be greatly superior to the Western cultures, in the range and\ndelicacy of their perceptions and expression. However, we are not here\nconcerned with the question of values, but with the configurations of\nsocieties. Tribal cultures cannot entertain the possibility of the individual\nor of the separate citizen. Their ideas of spaces and times are neither\ncontinuous nor uniform, but compassional and compressional in their intensity.\nIt is in its power to extend patterns of visual uniformity and continuity that\nthe “message” of the alphabet is felt by cultures.\n\nAs an intensification and extension of the visual function, the phonetic\nalphabet diminishes the role of the other senses of sound and touch and taste\nin any literate culture. The fact that this does not happen in cultures such\nas the Chinese, which use nonphonetic scripts, enables them to retain a rich\nstore of inclusive perception in depth of experience that tends to become\neroded in civilized cultures of the phonetic alphabet. For the ideogram is an\ninclusive _gestalt_ , not an analytic dissociation of senses and functions\nlike phonetic writing.\n\nThe achievements of the Western world, it is obvious, are testimony to the\ntremendous values of literacy. But many people are also disposed to object\nthat we have purchased our structure of specialist technology and values at\ntoo high a price. Certainly the lineal structuring of rational life by\nphonetic literacy has involved us in an interlocking set of consistencies that\nare striking enough to justify a much more extensive inquiry than that of the\npresent chapter. Perhaps there are better approaches along quite different\nlines; for example, consciousness is regarded as the mark of a rational being,\nyet there is nothing lineal or sequential about the total field of awareness\nthat exists in any moment of consciousness. Consciousness is not a verbal\nprocess. Yet during all our centuries of phonetic literacy we have favored the\nchain of inference as the mark of logic and reason. Chinese writing, in\ncontrast, invests each ideogram with a total intuition of being and reason\nthat allows only a small role to visual sequence as a mark of mental effort\nand organization. In Western literate society it is still plausible and\nacceptable to say that something “follows” from something, as if there were\nsome cause at work that makes such a sequence. It was David Hume who, in the\neighteenth century, demonstrated that there is no causality indicated in any\nsequence, natural or logical. The sequential is merely additive, not\ncausative. Hume’s argument, said Immanuel Kant, \"“awoke me from my dogmatic\nslumber.”\" Neither Hume nor Kant, however, detected the hidden cause of our\nWestern bias toward sequence as “logic” in the all-pervasive technology of the\nalphabet. Today in the electric age we feel as free to invent nonlineal logics\nas we do to make non-Euclidean geometries. Even the assembly line, as the\nmethod of analytic sequence for mechanizing every kind of making and\nproduction, is nowadays yielding to new forms.\n\nOnly alphabetic cultures have ever mastered connected lineal sequences as\npervasive forms of psychic and social organization. The breaking up of every\nkind of experience into uniform units in order to produce faster action and\nchange of form (applied knowledge) has been the secret of Western power over\nman and nature alike. That is the reason why our Western industrial programs\nhave quite involuntarily been so militant, and our military programs have been\nso industrial. Both are shaped by the alphabet in their technique of\ntransformation and control by making all situations uniform and continuous.\nThis procedure, manifest even in the Graeco-Roman phase, became more intense\nwith the uniformity and repeatability of the Gutenberg development.\n\nCivilization is built on literacy because literacy is a uniform processing of\na culture by a visual sense extended in space and time by the alphabet. In\ntribal cultures, experience is arranged by a dominant auditory sense-life that\nrepresses visual values. The auditory sense, unlike the cool and neutral eye,\nis hyper-esthetic and delicate and all-inclusive. Oral cultures act and react\nat the same time. Phonetic culture endows men with the means of repressing\ntheir feelings and emotions when engaged in action. To act without reacting,\nwithout involvement, is the peculiar advantage of Western literate man.\n\nThe story of The Ugly American describes the endless succession of blunders\nachieved by visual and civilized Americans when confronted with the tribal and\nauditory cultures of the East. As a civilized UNESCO experiment, running water\n— with its lineal organization of pipes — was installed recently in some\nIndian villages. Soon the villagers requested that the pipes be removed, for\nit seemed to them that the whole social life of the village had been\nimpoverished when it was no longer necessary for all to visit the communal\nwell. To us the pipe is a convenience. We do not think of it as culture or as\na product of literacy, any more than we think of literacy as changing our\nhabits, our emotions, or our perceptions. To nonliterate people, it is\nperfectly obvious that the most commonplace conveniences represent total\nchanges in culture.\n\nThe Russians, less permeated with the patterns of literate culture than\nAmericans, have much less difficulty in perceiving and accommodating the\nAsiatic attitudes. For the West, literacy has long been pipes and taps and\nstreets and assembly lines and inventories. Perhaps most potent of all as an\nexpression of literacy is our system of uniform pricing that penetrates\ndistant markets and speeds the turnover of commodities. Even our ideas of\ncause and effect in the literate West have long been in the form of things in\nsequence and succession, an idea that strikes any tribal or auditory culture\nas quite ridiculous, and one that has lost its prime place in our own new\nphysics and biology.\n\nAll the alphabets is use in the Western world, from that of Russia to that of\nthe Basques, from that of Portugal to that of Peru, are derivatives of the\nGraeco-Roman letters. Their unique separation of sight and sound from semantic\nand verbal content made them a most radical technology for the translation and\nhomogenization of cultures. All other forms of writing had served merely one\nculture, and had served to separate that culture from others. The phonetic\nletters alone could be used to translate, albeit crudely, the sounds of any\nlanguage into one-and-the-same visual code. Today, the effort of the Chinese\nto use our phonetic letters to translate their language has run into special\nproblems in the wide tonal variations and meanings of similar sounds. This has\nled to the practice of fragmenting Chinese monosyllables into polysyllables in\norder to eliminate tonal ambiguity. The Western phonetic alphabet is now at\nwork transforming the central auditory features of the Chinese language and\nculture in order that China can also develop the lineal and visual patterns\nthat give central unity and aggregate uniform power to Western work and\norganization. As we move out of the Gutenberg era of our own culture, we can\nmore readily discern its primary features of homogeneity, uniformity, and\ncontinuity. These were the characteristics that gave the Greeks and Romans\ntheir easy ascendancy over the nonliterate barbarians. The barbarian or tribal\nman, then as now, was hampered by cultural pluralism, uniqueness, and\ndiscontinuity.\n\nTo sum up, pictographic and hieroglyphic writing as used in Babylonian, Mayan,\nand Chinese cultures represents an extension of the visual sense for storing\nand expediting access to human experience. All of these forms give pictorial\nexpression to oral meanings. As such, they approximate the animated cartoon\nand are extremely unwieldy, requiring many signs for the infinity of data and\noperations of social action. In contrast, the phonetic alphabet, by a few\nletters only, was able to encompass all languages. Such an achievement,\nhowever, involved the separation of both signs and sounds from their semantic\nand dramatic meanings. No other system of writing had accomplished this feat.\n\nThe same separation of sight and sound and meaning that is peculiar to the\nphonetic alphabet also extends to its social and psychological effects.\nLiterate man undergoes much separation of his imaginative, emotional, and\nsense life, as Rousseau (and later the Romantic poets and philosophers)\nproclaimed long ago. Today the mere mention of D. H. Lawrence will serve to\nrecall the twentieth-century efforts made to by-pass literate man in order to\nrecover human “wholeness.” If Western literate man undergoes much dissociation\nof inner sensibility from his use of the alphabet, he also wins his personal\nfreedom to dissociate himself from clan and family. This freedom to shape an\nindividual career manifested itself in the ancient world in military life.\nCareers were open to talents in Republican Rome, as much as in Napoleonic\nFrance, and for the same reasons. The new literacy had created an homogeneous\nand malleable milieu in which the mobility of armed groups and of ambitious\nindividuals, equally, was as novel as it was practical.\n\n  *[UNESCO]: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n\n\n![Roads and Paper Routes](images/title-10.png)\n\nIt was not until the advent of the telegraph that messages could travel faster\nthan a messenger. Before this, roads and the written word were closely\ninterrelated. It is only since the telegraph that information has detached\nitself from such solid commodities as stone and papyrus, much as money had\nearlier detached itself from hides, bullion, and metals, and has ended as\npaper. The term “communication” has had an extensive use in connection with\nroads and bridges, sea routes, rivers, and canals, even before it became\ntransformed into “information movement” in the electric age. Perhaps there is\nno more suitable way of defining the character of the electric age than by\nfirst studying the rise of the idea of transportation as communication, and\nthen the transition of the idea from transport to information by means of\nelectricity. The word “metaphor” is from the Greek _meta_ plus _pherein_ , to\ncarry across or transport. In this book, we are concerned with all forms of\ntransport of goods and information, both as metaphor and exchange. Each form\nof transport not only carries, but translates and transforms the sender, the\nreceiver, and the message. The use of any kind of medium or extension of man\nalters the patterns of interdependence among people, as it alters the ratios\namong our senses.\n\nIt is a persistent theme of this book that all technologies are extensions of\nour physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed. Again, unless\nthere were such increases of power and speed, new extensions of ourselves\nwould not occur or would be discarded. For an increase of power or speed in\nany kind of grouping of any components whatever is itself a disruption that\ncauses a change of organization. The alteration of social groupings, and the\nformation of new communities, occur with the increased speed of information\nmovement by means of paper messages and road transport. Such speedup means\nmuch more control at much greater distances. Historically, it meant the\nformation of the Roman Empire and the disruption of the previous city-states\nof the Greek world. Before the use of papyrus and alphabet created the\nincentives for building fast, hard-surface roads, the walled town and the\ncity-state were natural forms that could endure.\n\nVillage and city-state essentially are forms that include all human needs and\nfunctions. With greater speed and, therefore, greater military control at a\ndistance, the city-state collapsed. Once inclusive and self-contained, its\nneeds and functions were extended in the specialist activities of an empire.\nSpeedup tends to separate functions, both commercial and political, and\nacceleration beyond a point in any system becomes disruption and breakdown. So\nwhen Arnold Toynbee turns, in A Study of History, to a massive documentation\nof \"“the breakdowns of civilizations,”\" he begins by saying: \"“One of the most\nconspicuous marks of disintegration, as we have already noticed, is … when a\ndisintegrating civilisation purchases a reprieve by submitting to forcible\npolitical unification in a universal state.”\" Disintegration and reprieve,\nalike, are the consequence of ever faster movement of information by couriers\non excellent roads.\n\nSpeedup creates what some economists refer to as a _center-margin_ structure.\nWhen this becomes too extensive for the generating and control center, pieces\nbegin to detach themselves and to set up new center-margin systems of their\nown. The most familiar example is the story of the American colonies of Great\nBritain. When the thirteen colonies began to develop a considerable social and\neconomic life of their own, they felt the need to become centers themselves,\nwith their own margins. This is the time when the original center may make a\nmore rigorous effort of centralized control of the margins, as, indeed, Great\nBritain did. The slowness of sea travel proved altogether inadequate to the\nmaintenance of so extensive an empire on a mere center-margin basis. Land\npowers can more easily attain a unified center-margin pattern than sea powers.\nIt is the relative slowness of sea travel that inspires sea powers to foster\nmultiple centers by a kind of seeding process. Sea powers thus tend to create\ncenters without margins, and land empires favor the center-margin structure.\nElectric speeds create centers everywhere. Margins cease to exist on this\nplanet.\n\nLack of homogeneity in speed of information movement creates diversity of\npatterns in organization. It is quite predictable, then, that any new means of\nmoving information will alter any power structure whatever. So long as the new\nmeans is everywhere available at the same time, there is a possibility that\nthe structure may be changed without breakdown. Where there are great\ndiscrepancies in speeds of movement, as between air and road travel or between\ntelephone and typewriter, serious conflicts occur within organizations. The\nmetropolis of our time has become a test case for such discrepancies. If\nhomogeneity of speeds were total, there would be no rebellion and no\nbreakdown. With print, political unity via homogeneity became feasible for the\nfirst time. In ancient Rome, however, there was only the light paper\nmanuscript to pierce the opacity, or to reduce the discontinuity, of the\ntribal villages; and when the paper supplies failed, the roads were vacated,\nas they were in our own age during gas-rationing. Thus the old city-state\nreturned, and feudalism replaced republicanism.\n\nIt seems obvious enough that technical means of speedup should wipe out the\nindependence of villages and city-states. Whenever speedup has occurred, the\nnew centralist power always takes action to homogenize as many marginal areas\nas possible. The process that Rome effected by the phonetic alphabet geared to\nits paper routes has been occurring in Russia for the last century. Again,\nfrom the current example of Africa we can observe how very much visual\nprocessing of the human psyche by alphabetic means will be needed before any\nappreciable degree of homogenized social organization is possible. Much of\nthis visual processing was done in the ancient world by nonliterate\ntechnologies, as in Assyria. The phonetic alphabet has no rival, however, as a\ntranslator of man out of the closed tribal echo-chamber into the neutral\nvisual world of lineal organization.\n\nThe situation of Africa today is complicated by the new electronic technology.\nWestern man is himself being de-Westernized by his own new speedup, as much as\nthe Africans are being detribalized by our old print and industrial\ntechnology. If we understood our own media old and new, these confusions and\ndisruptions could be programmed and synchronized. The very success we enjoy in\nspecializing and separating functions in order to have speedup, however, is at\nthe same time the cause of inattention and unawareness of the situation. It\nhas ever been thus in the Western world at least. Self-consciousness of the\ncauses and limits of one’s own culture seems to threaten the ego structure and\nis, therefore, avoided. Nietzsche said understanding stops action, and men of\naction seem to have an intuition of the fact in their shunning the dangers of\ncomprehension.\n\nThe point of the matter of speedup by wheel, road and paper is the extension\nof power in an ever more homogenous and uniform space. This the real potential\nof the Roman technology was not realized until printing had given road and\nwheel a much greater speed than that of the Roman vortex. Yet the speedup of\nthe electronic age is as disrupting for literate, lineal, and Western man as\nthe Roman paper routes were for tribal villagers. Our speedup today is not a\nslow explosion outward from center to margins but an instant implosion and an\ninterfusion of space and functions. Our specialist and fragmented civilization\nof center-margin structure is suddenly experiencing an instantaneous\nreassembling of all its mechanized bits into an organic whole. This is the new\nworld of the global village. The village, as Mumford explains in The City in\nHistory, had achieved a social and institutional extension of all human\nfaculties. Speedup and city aggregates only served to separate these from one\nanother in more specialist forms. The electronic age cannot sustain the very\nlow gear of a center-margin structure such as we associate with the past two\nthousand years of the Western world. Nor is this a question of values. If we\nunderstood our older media, such as roads and the written word, and if we\nvalued their human effects sufficiently, we could reduce or even eliminate the\nelectronic factor from our lives. Is there an instance of any culture that\nunderstood the technology that sustained its structure and was prepared to\nkeep it that way? If so, that would be an instance of values or reasoned\npreference. The values or preferences that arise from the mere automatic\noperation of this or that technology in our social lives are not capable of\nbeing perpetuated.\n\nIn the chapter on the wheel it will be shown that transport without wheels had\nplayed a big role before the wheel, some of which was by sledge, over both\nsnow and bogs. Much of it was by pack animal — woman being the first pack\nanimal. Most wheelless transport in the past, however, was by river and by\nsea, a fact that is today as richly expressed as ever in the location and form\nof the great cities of the world. Some writers have observed that man’s oldest\nbeast of burden was woman, because the male had to be free to run interference\nfor the woman, as ball-carrier, as it were. But that phase belonged to the\npre-wheel stage of transport, when there was only the tractless waste of man\nthe hunter and food-gatherer. Today, when the greatest volume of transport\nconsists in the moving of information, the wheel and the road are undergoing\nrecession and obsolescence; but in the first instance, given the pressure for,\nand from, wheels, there had to be roads to accommodate them. Settlements had\ncreated the impulse for exchange and for the increasing movement of raw\nmaterial and produce from countryside to processing centers, where there was\ndivision of labor and specialist craft skills. Improvement of wheel and road\nmore and more brought the town to the country in a reciprocal spongelike\naction of give-and-take. It is a process we have seen in this century with the\nmotorcar. Great improvements in roads brought the city more and more to the\ncountry. The road became a substitute for the country by the time people began\nto talk about “taking a spin in the country.” With superhighways the road\nbecame a wall between man and the country. Then came the stage of the highway\nas city, a city stretching continuously across the continent, dissolving all\nearlier cities into the sprawling aggregates that desolate their populations\ntoday.\n\nWith air transport comes a further disruption of the old town-country complex\nthat had occurred with wheel and road. With the plane the cities began to have\nthe same slender relation to human needs that museums do. They became\ncorridors of showcases echoing the departing forms of industrial assembly\nlines. The road is, then, used less and less for travel, and more and more for\nrecreation. The traveler now turns to the airways, and thereby ceases to\nexperience the act of traveling. As people used to say that an ocean liner\nmight as well be a hotel in a big city, the jet traveler, whether he is over\nTokyo or New York, might just as well be in a cocktail lounge so far as travel\nexperience is concerned. He will begin to travel only after he lands.\n\nMeantime, the countryside, as oriented and fashioned by plane, by highway, and\nby electric information-gathering, tends to become once more the nomadic\ntrackless area that preceded the wheel. The beatniks gather on the sands to\nmeditate _haiku_.\n\nThe principal factors in media impact on existing social forms are\nacceleration and disruption. Today the acceleration tends to be total, and\nthus ends space as the main factor in social arrangements. Toynbee sees the\nacceleration factor as translating the physical into moral problems, pointing\nto the antique road crowded with dog carts, wagons, and rickshaws as full of\nminor nuisance, but also minor dangers. Further, as the forces impelling\ntraffic mount in power, there is no more problem of hauling and carrying, but\nthe physical problem is translated into a psychological one as the\nannihilation of space permits easy annihilation of travelers as well. This\nprinciple applies to all media study. All means of interchange and of human\ninterassociation tend to improve by acceleration. Speed, in turn, accentuates\nproblems of form and structure. The older arrangements had not been made with\na view to such speeds, and people begin to sense a draining-away of life\nvalues as they try to make the old physical forms adjust to the new and\nspeedier movement. These problems, however, are not new. Julius Caesar’s first\nact upon assuming power was to restrict the night movement of wheeled vehicles\nin the city of Rome in order to permit sleep. Improved transport in the\nRenaissance turned the medieval walled towns into slums.\n\nPrior to the considerable diffusion of power through alphabet and papyrus,\neven the attempts of kings to extend their rule in spatial terms were opposed\nat home by the priestly bureaucracies. Their complex and unwieldy media of\nstone inscription made wide-ranging empires appear very dangerous to such\nstatic monopolies. The struggles between those who exercised power over the\nhearts of men and those who sought to control the physical resources of\nnations were not of one time and place. In the Old Testament, just this kind\nof struggle is reported in the Book of Samuel (I, viii) when the children of\nIsrael besought Samuel to give them a king. Samuel explained to them the\nnature of kingly, as opposed to priestly, rule:\n\n> This will be the manner of the King that shall reign over you: he will take\n> your sons, and appoint them unto him for his chariots; and they shall run\n> before his chariots: and he will appoint them unto him for captains of\n> thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plough his\n> ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the\n> instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be\n> confectionaries, and to be cooks and to be bakers. And he will take your\n> fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and\n> give them to his servants.\n\nParadoxically, the effect of the wheel and of paper in organizing new power\nstructures was not to decentralize but to centralize. A speedup in\ncommunications always enables a central authority to extend its operations to\nmore distant margins. The introduction of alphabet and papyrus meant that many\nmore people had to be trained as scribes and administrators. However, the\nresulting extension of homogenization and of uniform training did not come\ninto play in the ancient or medieval world to any great degree. It was not\nreally until the mechanization of writing in the Renaissance that intensely\nunified and centralized power was possible. Since this process is still\noccurring, it should be easy for us to see that it was in the armies of Egypt\nand Rome that a kind of democratization by uniform technological education\noccurred. Careers were then open to talents for those with literate training.\nIn the chapter on the written word we saw how phonetic writing translated\ntribal man into a visual world and invited him to undertake the visual\norganization of space. The priestly groups in the temples had been more\nconcerned with the records of the past and with the control of the inner space\nof the unseen than with outward military conquest. Hence, there was a clash\nbetween the priestly monopolizers of knowledge and those who wished to apply\nit abroad as new conquest and power. (This same clash now recurs between the\nuniversity and the business world.) It was this kind of rivalry that inspired\nPtolemy II to establish the great library at Alexandria as a center of\nimperial power. The huge staff of civil servants and scribes assigned to many\nspecialist tasks was an antithetic and countervailing force to the Egyptian\npriesthood. The library could serve the political organization of empire in a\nway that did not interest the priesthood at all. A not-dissimilar rivalry is\ndeveloping today between the atomic scientists and those who are mainly\nconcerned with power.\n\nIf we realize that the city as center was in the first instance an aggregate\nof threatened villagers, it is then easier for us to grasp how such harassed\ncompanies of refugees might fan out into an empire. The city-state as a form\nwas not a response to peaceful commercial development, but a huddling for\nsecurity amidst anarchy and dissolution. Thus the Greek city-state was a\ntribal form of inclusive and integral community, quite unlike the specialist\ncities that grew up as extensions of Roman military expansion. The Greek city-\nstates eventually disintegrated by the usual action of specialist trading and\nthe separation of functions that Mumford portrays in The City in History. The\nRoman cities began that way—as specialist operations of the central power. The\nGreek cities ended that way.\n\nIf a city undertakes rural trade, it sets up at once a center-margin relation\nwith the rural area in question. That relation involves taking staples and raw\nproduce from the country in exchange for specialist products of the craftsman.\nIf, on the other hand, the same city attempts to engage in overseas trade, it\nis more natural to “seed” another city center, as the Greeks did, rather than\nto deal with the overseas area as a specialized margin or raw material supply.\n\nA brief review of the structural changes in the organization of space as they\nresulted from wheel, road, and papyrus could go as follows: There was first\nthe village, which lacked all of these group extensions of the private\nphysical body. The village, however, was already a form or community different\nfrom that of food-gathering hunters and fishers, for villagers may be\nsedentary and may begin a division of labor and functions. Their being\ncongregated is, itself, a form of acceleration of human activities which\nprovides momentum for further separation and specialization of action. Such\nare the conditions for the extension of feet-as-wheel to speed production and\nexchange. These are, also, the conditions that intensify communal conflicts\nand ruptures that send men huddling into ever larger aggregates, in order to\nresist the accelerated activities of other communities. The villages are swept\nup into the city-state by way of resistance and for the purpose of security\nand protection.\n\nThe village had institutionalized all human functions in forms of low\nintensity. In this mild form everyone could play many roles. Participation was\nhigh, and organization was low. This is the formula for stability in any type\nof organization. Nevertheless, the enlargement of village forms in the city-\nstate called for greater intensity and the inevitable separation of functions\nto cope with this intensity and competition. The villagers had all\nparticipated in the seasonal rituals that in the city became the specialized\nGreek drama. Mumford feels that \"“The village measure prevailed in the\ndevelopment of the Greek cities, down to the fourth century …”\" (The City in\nHistory). It is this extension and translation of the human organs into the\nvillage model without loss of corporal unity that Mumford uses as a criterion\nof excellence for city forms in any time or locale. This biological approach\nto the man-made environment is sought today once more in the electric age. How\nstrange that the idea of the “human scale” should have seemed quite without\nappeal during the mechanical centuries.\n\nThe natural tendency of the enlarged community of the city is to increase the\nintensity and accelerate functions of every sort, whether of speech, or\ncrafts, or currency and exchange. This, in turn, implies an inevitable\nextension of these actions by subdivision or, what is the same thing, new\ninvention. So that even though the city was formed as a kind of protective\nhide or shield for man, this protective layer was purchased at the cost of\nmaximized struggle within the walls. War games such as those described by\nHerodotus began as ritual blood baths between the citizenry. Rostrum, law\ncourts, and marketplace all acquired the intense image of divisive competition\nthat is nowadays called “the rat race.” Nevertheless, it was amidst such\nirritations that man produced his greatest inventions as counter-irritants.\nThese inventions were extensions of himself by means of concentrated toil, by\nwhich he hoped to neutralize distress. The Greek word _ponos_ , or “toil,” was\na term used by Hippocrates, the father of medicine, to describe the fight of\nthe body in disease. Today this idea is called _homeostasis_ , or equilibrium\nas a strategy of the staying power of any body. All organizations, but\nespecially biological ones, struggle to remain constant in their inner\ncondition amidst the variations of outer shock and change. The man-made social\nenvironment as an extension of man’s physical body is no exception. The city,\nas a form of the body politic, responds to new pressures and irritations by\nresourceful new extensions — always in the effort to exert staying power,\nconstancy, equilibrium, and _homeostasis_.\n\nThe city, having been formed for protection, unexpectedly generated fierce\nintensities and new hybrid energies from accelerated interplay of functions\nand knowledge. It burst forth into aggression. The alarm of the village,\nfollowed by the resistance of the city, expanded into the exhaustion and\ninertia of empire. These three stages of the disease and irritation syndrome\nwere felt, by those living through them, as normal physical expressions of\ncounter-irritant recovery from disease.\n\nThe third stage of struggle for equilibrium among the forces within the city\ntook the form of empire, or a universal state, that generated the extension of\nhuman senses in wheel, road, and alphabet. We can sympathize with those who\nfirst saw in these tools a providential means of bringing order to distant\nareas of turbulence and anarchy. These tools would have seemed a glorious form\nof “foreign aid,” extending the blessings of the center to the barbarian\nmargins. At this moment, for example, we are quite in the dark about the\npolitical implications of Telstar. By outering these satellites as extensions\nof our nervous system, there is an automatic response in all the organs of the\nbody politic of mankind. Such new intensity of proximity imposed by Telstar\ncalls for radical rearrangement of all organs in order to maintain staying\npower and equilibrium. The teaching and learning process for every child will\nbe affected sooner rather than later. The time factor in every decision of\nbusiness and finance will acquire new patterns. Among the peoples of the world\nstrange new vortices of power will appear unexpectedly.\n\nThe full-blown city coincides with the development of writing — especially of\nphonetic writing, the specialist form of writing that makes a division between\nsight and sound. It was with this instrument that Rome was able to reduce the\ntribal areas to some visual order. The effects of phonetic literacy do not\ndepend upon persuasion or cajolery for their acceptance. This technology for\ntranslating the resonating tribal world into Euclidean lineality and visuality\nis automatic. Roman roads and Roman streets were uniform and repeatable\nwherever they occurred. There was no adaptation to the contours of local hill\nor custom. With the decline of papyrus supplies, the wheeled traffic stopped\non these roads, too. Deprivation of papyrus, resulting from the Roman loss of\nEgypt, meant the decline of bureaucracy, and of army organization as well.\nThus the medieval world grew up without uniform roads or cities or\nbureaucracies, and it fought the wheel, as later city forms fought the\nrailways; and as we, today, fight the automobile. For new speed and power are\nnever compatible with existing spatial and social arrangements.\n\nWriting about the new straight avenues of the seventeenth-century cities,\nMumford points to a factor that was also present in the Roman city with its\nwheeled traffic; namely, the need for broad straight avenues to speed military\nmovements, and to express the pomp and circumstance of power. In the Roman\nworld the army was the work force of a mechanized wealth-creating process. By\nmeans of soldiers as uniform and replaceable parts, the Roman military machine\nmade and delivered the goods, very much in the manner of industry during the\nearly phases of the industrial revolution. Trade followed the legions. More\nthan that, the legions were the industrial machine, itself; and numerous new\ncities were like new factories manned by uniformly trained army personnel.\nWith the spread of literacy after printing, the bond between the uniformed\nsoldier and the wealth-making factory hand became less visible. It was obvious\nenough in Napoleon’s armies. Napoleon, with his citizen-armies, was the\nindustrial revolution itself, as it reached areas long protected from it.\n\nThe Roman army as a mobile, industrial wealth-making force created in addition\na vast consumer public in the Roman towns. Division of labor always creates a\nseparation between producer and consumer, even as it tends to separate the\nplace of work and the living space. Before Roman literate bureaucracy, nothing\ncomparable to the Roman consumer specialists had been seen in the world. This\nfact was institutionalized in the individual known as “parasite,” and in the\nsocial institution of the gladiatorial games. (_Panem et circenses._) The\nprivate sponge and the collective sponge, both reaching out for their rations\nof sensation, achieved a horrible distinctness and clarity that matched the\nraw power of the predatory army machine.\n\nWith the cutting-off of the supplies of papyrus by the Mohammedans, the\nMediterranean, long a Roman lake, became a Muslim lake, and the Roman center\ncollapsed. What had been the margins of this center-margin structure became\nindependent centers on a new feudal, structural base. The Roman center\ncollapsed by the fifth century a.d. as wheel, road, and paper dwindled into a\nghostly paradigm of former power.\n\nPapyrus never returned. Byzantium, like the medieval centers, relied heavily\non parchment, but this was too expensive and scarce a material to speed\ncommerce or even education. It was paper from China, gradually making its way\nthrough the Near East to Europe, that accelerated education and commerce\nsteadily from the eleventh century, and provided the basis for “the\nRenaissance of the twelfth century,” popularizing prints and, finally, making\nprinting possible by the fifteenth century.\n\nWith the moving of information in printed form, the wheel and the road came\ninto play again after having been in abeyance for a thousand years. In\nEngland, pressure from the press brought about hard-surface roads in the\neighteenth century, with all the population and industrial rearrangement that\nentailed. Print, or mechanized writing, introduced a separation and extension\nof human functions unimaginable even in Roman times. It was only natural,\ntherefore, that greatly increased wheel speeds, both on road and in factory,\nshould be related to the alphabet that had once done a similar job of speedup\nand specialization in the ancient world. Speed, at least in its lower reaches\nof the mechanical order, always operates to separate, to extend, and to\namplify functions of the body. Even specialist learning in higher education\nproceeds by ignoring interrelationships; for such complex awareness slows down\nthe achieving of expertness.\n\nThe post roads of England were, for the most part, paid for by the newspapers.\nThe rapid increase of traffic brought in the railway, that accommodated a more\nspecialized form of wheel than the road. The story of modern America that\nbegan with the discovery of the white man by the Indians, as a wag has truly\nsaid, quickly passed from exploration by canoe to development by railway. For\nthree centuries Europe invested in America for its fish and its furs. The\nfishing schooner and the canoe preceded the road and the postal route as marks\nof our North American spatial organization. The European investors in the fur\ntrade naturally did not want the trapping lines overrun by Tom Sawyers and\nHuck Finns. They fought land surveyors and settlers, like Washington and\nJefferson, who simply would not think in terms of mink. Thus the War of\nIndependence was deeply involved in media and staple rivalries. Any new\nmedium, by its acceleration, disrupts the lives and investments of whole\ncommunities. It was the railway that raised the art of war to unheard-of\nintensity, making the American Civil War the first major conflict fought by\nrail, and causing it to be studied and admired by all European general staffs,\nwho had not yet had an opportunity to use railways for a general blood-\nletting.\n\nWar is never anything less than accelerated technological change. It begins\nwhen some notable disequilibrium among existing structures has been brought\nabout by inequality of rates of growth. The very late industrialization and\nunification of Germany had left her out of the race for staples and colonies\nfor many years. As the Napoleonic wars were technologically a sort of\ncatching-up of France with England, the First World War was itself a major\nphase of the final industrialization of Germany and America. As Rome had not\nshown before, and Russia has shown today, militarism is itself the main route\nof technological education and acceleration for lagging areas.\n\nAlmost unanimous enthusiasm for improved routes of land transportation\nfollowed the War of 1812. Furthermore, the British blockade of the Atlantic\ncoast had compelled an unprecedented amount of land carriage, thus emphasizing\nthe unsatisfactory character of the highways. War is certainly a form of\nemphasis that delivers many a telling touch to lagging social attention.\nHowever, in the very Hot Peace since the Second War, it is the highways of the\nmind that have been found inadequate. Many have felt dissatisfaction with our\neducational methods since Sputnik, in exactly the same spirit that many\ncomplained about the highways during the War of 1812.\n\nNow that man has extended his central nervous system by electric technology,\nthe field of battle has shifted to mental image-making-and-breaking, both in\nwar and in business. Until the electric age, higher education had been a\nprivilege and a luxury for the leisured classes; today it has become a\nnecessity for production and survival. Now, when information itself is the\nmain traffic, the need for advanced knowledge presses on the spirits of the\nmost routine-ridden minds. So sudden an upsurge of academic training into the\nmarketplace has in it the quality of classical peripety or reversal, and the\nresult has been a wild guffaw from the gallery and the campus. The hilarity,\nhowever, will die down as the Executive Suites are taken over by the Ph.D.s.\n\nFor an insight into the ways in which the acceleration of wheel and road and\npaper rescramble population and settlement patterns, let us glance at some\ninstances provided by Oscar Handlin in his study Boston’s Immigrants. In 1790,\nhe tells us, Boston was a compact unit with all workers and traders living in\nsight of each other, so that there was no tendency to section residential\nareas on a class basis: \"“But as the town grew, as the outlying districts\nbecame more accessible, the people spread out and at the same time were\nlocalized in distinctive areas.”\" That one sentence capsulates the theme of\nthis chapter. The sentence can be generalized to include the art of writing:\n\"“As knowledge was spread out visually and as it became more accessible in\nalphabetic form, it was localized and divided into specialties.”\" Up to the\npoint just short of electrification, increase of speed produces division of\nfunction, and of social classes, and of knowledge.\n\nAt electric speed, however, all that is reversed. Implosion and contraction\nthen replace mechanical explosion and expansion. If the Handlin formula is\nextended to power, it becomes: \"“As power grew, and as outlying areas became\naccessible to power, it was localized in distinctive delegated jobs and\nfunctions.”\" This formula is a principle of acceleration at all levels of\nhuman organization. It concerns especially those extensions of our physical\nbodies that appear in wheel and road and paper messages. Now that we have\nextended not just our physical organs but the nervous system, itself, in\nelectric technology, the principle of specialism and division as a factor of\nspeed no longer applies. When information moves at the speed of signals in the\ncentral nervous system, man is confronted with the obsolescence of all earlier\nforms of acceleration, such as road and rail. What emerges is a total field of\ninclusive awareness. The old patterns of psychic and social adjustment become\nirrelevant.\n\nUntil the 1820s, Handlin tells us, Bostonians walked to and fro, or used\nprivate conveyances. Horse-drawn buses were introduced in 1826, and these\nspeeded up and extended business a great deal. Meantime the speedup of\nindustry in England had extended business into the rural areas, dislodging\nmany from the land and increasing the rate of immigration. Sea transport of\nimmigrants became lucrative and encouraged a great speedup of ocean transport.\nThen the Cunard Line was subsidized by the British government in order to\nensure swift contact with the colonies. The railways soon linked into this\nCunard service, to convey mail and immigrants inland.\n\nAlthough America developed a massive service of inland canals and river\nsteamboats, they were not geared to the speeding wheels of the new industrial\nproduction. The railroad was needed to cope with mechanized production, as\nmuch as to span the great distances of the continent. The steam railroad as an\naccelerator proved to be one of the most revolutionary of all extensions of\nour physical bodies, creating a new political centralism and a new kind of\nurban shape and size. It is to the railroad that the American city owes its\nabstract grid layout, and the nonorganic separation of production,\nconsumption, and residence. It is the motorcar that scrambled the abstract\nshape of the industrial town, mixing up its separated functions to a degree\nthat has frustrated and baffled both planner and citizen. It remained for the\nairplane to complete the confusion by amplifying the mobility of the citizen\nto the point where urban space as such was irrelevant. Metropolitan space is\nequally irrelevant for the telephone, the telegraph, the radio, and\ntelevision. What the town planners call “the human scale” in discussing ideal\nurban spaces is equally unrelated to these electric forms. Our electric\nextensions of ourselves simply by-pass space and time, and create problems of\nhuman involvement and organization for which there is no precedent. We may yet\nyearn for the simple days of the automobile and the superhighway.\n\n\n![Number: Profile of the Crowd](images/title-11.png)\n\nHitler made a special horror of the Versailles Treaty because it had deflated\nthe German army. After 1870 the heel-clicking members of the German army had\nbecome the new symbol of tribal unity and power. In England and America the\nsame sense of numerical grandeur from sheer numbers was associated with the\nmounting output of industry, and the statistics of wealth and production:\n“tanks a million.” The power of sheer numbers, in wealth or in crowds, to set\nup a dynamic drive toward growth and aggrandizement is mysterious. Elias\nCanetti in Crowds and Power illustrates the profound tie between monetary\ninflation and crowd behavior. He is baffled by our failure to study inflation\nas a crowd phenomenon, since its effects on our modern world are pervasive.\nThe drive toward unlimited growth inherent in any kind of crowd, heap, or\nhorde would seem to link economic and population inflation.\n\nIn the theater, at a ball, at a ball game, in church, every individual enjoys\nall those others present. The pleasure of being among the masses is the sense\nof the joy in the multiplication of numbers, which has long been suspect among\nthe literate members of Western society.\n\nIn such society, the separation of the individual from the group in space\n(privacy), and in thought (“point of view”), and in work (specialism), has had\nthe cultural and technological support of literacy, and its attendant galaxy\nof fragmented industrial and political institutions. But the power of the\nprinted word to create the homogenized social man grew steadily until our\ntime, creating the paradox of the “mass mind” and the mass militarism of\ncitizen armies. Pushed to the mechanized extreme, letters have often seemed to\nproduce effects opposite to civilization, just as numbering in earlier times\nseemed to break tribal unity, as the Old Testament declares (\"“And Satan rose\nup against Israel, and moved David to number Israel”\"). Phonetic letters and\nnumbers were the first means of fragmenting and detribalizing man.\n\nThroughout Western history we have traditionally and rightly regarded letters\nas the source of civilization, and looked to our literatures as the hallmark\nof civilized attainment. Yet all along, there has been with us a shadow of\nnumber, the language of science. In isolation, number is as mysterious as\nwriting. Seen as an extension of our physical bodies, it becomes quite\nintelligible. Just as writing is an extension and separation of our most\nneutral and objective sense, the sense of sight, number is an extension and\nseparation of our most intimate and interrelating activity, our sense of\ntouch.\n\nThis faculty of touch, called the “haptic” sense by the Greeks, was\npopularized as such by the Bauhaus program of sensuous education, through the\nwork of Paul Klee, Walter Gropius, and many others in the Germany of the\n1920s. The sense of touch, as offering a kind of nervous system or organic\nunity in the work of art, has obsessed the minds of the artists since the time\nof Cézanne. For more than a century now artists have tried to meet the\nchallenge of the electric age by investing the tactile sense with the role of\na nervous system for unifying all the others. Paradoxically, this has been\nachieved by “abstract art,” which offers a central nervous system for a work\nof art, rather than the conventional husk of the old pictorial image. More and\nmore it has occurred to people that the sense of touch is necessary to\nintegral existence. The weightless occupant of the space capsule has to fight\nto retain the integrating sense of touch. Our mechanical technologies for\nextending and separating the functions of our physical beings have brought us\nnear to a state of disintegration by putting us out of touch with ourselves.\nIt may very well be that in our conscious inner lives the interplay among our\nsenses is what constitutes the sense of touch. Perhaps _touch_ is not just\nskin contact with _things_ , but the very life of things in the _mind_? The\nGreeks had the notion of a consensus or a faculty of “common sense” that\ntranslated each sense into each other sense, and conferred consciousness on\nman. Today, when we have extended all parts of our bodies and senses by\ntechnology, we are haunted by the need for an outer consensus of technology\nand experience that would raise our communal lives to the level of a world-\nwide consensus. When we have achieved a world-wide fragmentation, it is not\nunnatural to think about a world-wide integration. Such a universality of\nconscious being for mankind was dreamt of by Dante, who believed that men\nwould remain mere broken fragments until they should be united in an inclusive\nconsciousness. What we have today, instead of a social consciousness\nelectrically ordered, however, is a private subconsciousness or individual\n“point of view” rigorously imposed by older mechanical technology. This is a\nperfectly natural result of “culture lag” or conflict, in a world suspended\nbetween two technologies.\n\nThe ancient world associated number magically with the properties of physical\nthings, and with the necessary causes of things, much as science has tended\nuntil recent times to reduce all objects to numerical quantities. In any and\nall of its manifestations, however, number seems to have both auditory and\nrepetitive resonance, and a tactile dimension as well.\n\nIt is the quality of number that explains its power to create the effect of an\nicon or an inclusive compressed image. Such is its use in newspaper and\nmagazine reporting, as: “\"Cyclist John Jameson, 12, Collides with Bus,”\" or\n\"“William Samson, 51, New Vice-President in Charge of Brooms.”\" By rule of\nthumb the journalists have discovered the iconic power of number.\n\nSince Henri Bergson and the Bauhaus group of artists, to say nothing of Jung\nand Freud, the nonliterate and even antiliterate values of tribal man have in\ngeneral received enthusiastic study and promotion. For many European artists\nand intellectuals, jazz became one of the rallying points in their quest for\nthe integral Romantic Image. The uncritical enthusiasm of the European\nintellectual for tribal culture appears in the exclamation of the architect Le\nCorbusier on first seeing Manhattan: \"“It is hot-jazz in stone.”\" It appears\nagain in the artist Moholy-Nagy’s account of his visit to a San Francisco\nnight club in 1940. A Negro band was playing with zest and laughter. Suddenly\na player intoned, \"_“One million and three,”_\" and was answered: \"_”One\nmillion and seven and a half.”_\" Then another sang, \"_“Eleven,”_\" and another,\n\"_“Twenty-one.”_\" Then amidst \"“happy laughter and shrill singing the numbers\ntook over the place.”\"\n\nMoholy-Nagy notes how, to Europeans, America seems to be the land of\nabstractions, where numbers have taken on an existence of their own in phrases\nlike “57 Varieties,” “the 5 and 10,” or “7 Up” and “behind the 8-ball.” It\nfigures. Perhaps this is a kind of echo of an industrial culture that depends\nheavily on prices, charts, and figures. Take 36-24-36. Numbers cannot become\nmore sensuously tactile than when mumbled as the magic formula for the female\nfigure while the haptic hand sweeps the air.\n\nBaudelaire had the true intuition of number as a tactile hand or nervous\nsystem for interrelating separate units, when he said that \"“number is within\nthe individual. Intoxication is a number.”\" That explains why \"“the pleasure\nof being in a crowd is a mysterious expression of delight in the\nmultiplication of number.”\" Number, that is to say, is not only auditory and\nresonant, like the spoken word, but originates in the sense of touch, of which\nit is an extension. The statistical aggregation or crowding of numbers yields\nthe current cave-drawings or finger-paintings of the statisticians’ charts. In\nevery sense, the amassing of numbers statistically gives man a new influx of\nprimitive intuition and magically subconscious awareness, whether of public\ntaste or feeling: \"“You feel better satisfied when you use well-known\nbrands.”\"\n\nLike money and clocks and all other forms of measurement, numbers acquired a\nseparate life and intensity with the growth of literacy. Nonliterate societies\nhad small use for numbers, and today the nonliterate digital computer\nsubstitutes “yes” and “no” for numbers. The computer is strong on contours,\nweak on digits. In effect, then, the electric age brings number back into\nunity with visual and auditory experience, for good or ill.\n\nOswald Spengler’s The Decline of the West originated in large part from his\nconcern with the new mathematics. Non-Euclidean geometries, on one hand, and\nthe rise of Functions in number theory, on the other, seemed to Spengler to\nspell the end of Western man. He had not grasped the fact that the invention\nof Euclidean space is, itself, a direct result of the action of the phonetic\nalphabet on the human senses. Nor had he realized that number is an extension\nof the physical body of man, an extension of our sense of touch. The\n\"“infinity of functional processes,”\" into which Spengler gloomily saw\ntraditional number and geometry dissolving, is, also, the extension of our\ncentral nervous system in electrical technologies. We need not feel grateful\nto apocalyptic writers like Spengler, who see our technologies as cosmic\nvisitors from outer space. The Spenglers are tribally entranced men who crave\nthe swoon back into collective unconsciousness and all the intoxication of\nnumber. In India the idea of _darshan_ — of the mystical experience of being\nin very large gatherings — stands at the opposite end of the spectrum from the\nWestern idea of conscious values.\n\nThe most primitive tribes of Australia and Africa, like the Eskimos of today,\nhave not yet reached finger-counting, nor do they have numbers in series.\nInstead they have a binary system of independent numbers for _one_ and _two_ ,\nwith composite numbers up to _six_. After _six_ , they perceive only “heap.”\nLacking the sense of series, they will scarcely notice when two pins have been\nremoved from a row of seven. They become aware at once, however, if _one_ pin\nis missing. Tobias Dantzig, who investigated these matters, points out (in\nNumber: The Language of Science) that the parity or kinesthetic sense of these\npeople is stronger than their number sense. It is certainly an indication of a\ndeveloping visual stress in a culture when number appears. A closely\nintegrated tribal culture will not easily yield to the separatist visual and\nindividualistic pressures that lead to the division of labor, and then to such\naccelerated forms as writing and money. On the other hand, Western man, were\nhe determined to cling to the fragmented and individualist ways that he has\nderived from the printed word in particular, would be well advised to scrap\nall his electric technology since the telegraph. The implosive (compressional)\ncharacter of the electric technology plays the disk or film of Western man\nbackward, into the heart of tribal darkness, or into what Joseph Conrad called\n\"“the Africa within.”\" The instant character of electric information movement\ndoes not enlarge, but involves, the family of man in the cohesive state of\nvillage living.\n\nIt seems contradictory that the fragmenting and divisive power of our analytic\nWestern world should derive from an accentuation of the visual faculty. This\nsame visual sense is, also, responsible for the habit of seeing all things as\ncontinuous and connected. Fragmentation by means of visual stress occurs in\nthat isolation of moment in time, or of aspect in space, that is beyond the\npower of touch, or hearing, or smell, or movement. By imposing unvisualizable\nrelationships that are the result of instant speed, electric technology\ndethrones the visual sense and restores us to the dominion of synesthesia, and\nthe close interinvolvement of the other senses.\n\nSpengler was plunged into a Slough of Despond by what he saw as the Western\nretreat from Numerical Magnitude into a Faery Land of Functions and abstract\nrelations. \"“The most valuable thing in classical mathematic,”\" he wrote, \"“is\nits proposition that number is the essence of all things _perceptible to the\nsenses_. Defining number as a measure, it contains the whole world-feeling of\na soul passionately devoted to the ‘here’ and ‘now.’ Measurement in this sense\nmeans the measurement of something near and corporeal.”\"\n\nThe ecstatic tribal man emanates from every page of Spengler. It never\noccurred to him that the _ratio_ among corporeal things could never be less\nthan rational. That is to say, rationality or consciousness is itself a ratio\nor proportion among the sensuous components of experience, and is not\nsomething _added_ to such sense experience. Subrational beings have no means\nof achieving such a ratio or proportion in their sense lives but are wired for\nfixed wave lengths, as it were, having infallibility in their own area of\nexperience. Consciousness, complex and subtle, can be impaired or ended by a\nmere stepping-up or dimming-down of any one sense intensity, which is the\nprocedure in hypnosis. And the intensification of one sense by a new medium\ncan hypnotize an entire community. Thus, when he thought he saw modern\nmathematics and science abandoning visual relations and constructions for a\nnonvisual theory of relations and functions, Spengler pronounced the demise of\nthe West.\n\nHad Spengler taken the time to discover the origins of both number and\nEuclidean space in the psychological effects of the phonetic alphabet, The\nDecline of the West might never have been written. That work is based on the\nassumption that classical man, Apollonian man, was not the product of a\ntechnological bias in Greek culture (namely, the early impact of literacy on a\ntribal society), but rather the result of a special tremor in the soul stuff\nthat embosomed the Greek world. This is a striking instance of how easily men\nof any one particular culture will panic when some familiar pattern or\nlandmark gets smudged or shifted because of the indirect pressure of new\nmedia. Spengler, as much as Hitler, had derived from radio a subconscious\nmandate to announce the end of all “rational” or visual values. He was acting\nlike Pip in Dickens’ Great Expectations. Pip was a poor boy who had a hidden\nbenefactor who wanted to raise Pip to the status of a gentleman. Pip was ready\nand willing until he found that his benefactor was an escaped convict.\nSpengler and Hitler and many more of the would-be \"“irrationalists”\" of our\ncentury are like singing-telegram delivery boys, who are quite innocent of any\nunderstanding of the medium that prompts the song they sing.\n\nSo far as Tobias Dantzig is concerned in his Number: The Language of Science,\nthe progress from the tactile fingering of toes and fingers to \"“the\nhomogeneous number concept, which made mathematics possible”\" is the result of\nvisual abstraction from the operation of tactile manipulation. We have both\nextremes of this process in our daily speech. The gangster term “to put the\nfinger on” says that somebody’s “number” has come up. At the extreme of the\ngraph profiles of the statisticians there is the frankly expressed object of\nmanipulation of population for varieties of power purposes. For example, in\nany large stockbroker’s office there is a modern medicine man known as “Mr.\nOdd Lots.” His magical function is to study the daily purchases and sales of\nthe small buyers on the big exchanges. Long experience has revealed that these\nsmall buyers are wrong 80 per cent of the time. A statistical profile of the\nfailure of the little man to be in touch enables the big operators to be about\n80 per cent right. Thus from error comes truth; and from poverty, riches,\nthanks to numbers. This is the modern magic of numbers. The more primitive\nattitude toward the magical power of numbers appeared in the dread of the\nEnglish when William the Conqueror numbered them and their chattels in what\nthe folk called the Doomsday Book.\n\nTo turn again briefly to the question of number in its more limited\nmanifestation, Dantzig, having made clear that the idea of homogeneity had to\ncome before primitive numbers could be advanced to the level of mathematics,\npoints to another literate and visual factor in the older mathematics.\n\"“Correspondence and succession, the two principles which permeate all\nmathematics—nay, all realms of exact thought — are woven into the very fabric\nof our number system,”\" he observes. So, indeed, are they woven into the very\nfabric of Western logic and philosophy. We have already seen how the phonetic\ntechnology fostered visual continuity and individual point of view, and how\nthese contributed to the rise of uniform Euclidean space. Dantzig says that it\nis the idea of correspondence which gives us cardinal numbers. Both of these\nspatial ideas — lineality and point of view — come with writing, especially\nwith phonetic writing; but neither is necessary in our new mathematics and\nphysics. Nor is writing necessary to an electric technology. Of course,\nwriting and conventional arithmetic may long continue to be of the utmost use\nto man, for all that. Even Einstein could not face the new quantum physics\nwith comfort. Too visual a Newtonian for the new task, he said that _quanta_\ncould not be handled mathematically. That is as much as to say that poetry\ncannot be properly translated into merely visual form on the printed page.\n\nDantzig develops his points about number by saying that a literate population\nsoon departs from the abacus and from finger enumeration, though arithmetic\nmanuals in the Renaissance continued to give elaborate rules for calculating\non the hands. It could be true that numbers preceded literacy in some\ncultures, but so did visual stress precede writing. For writing is only the\nprincipal manifestation of the extension of our visual sense, as the\nphotograph and the movie today may well remind us. And long before literate\ntechnology, the binary factors of hands and feet sufficed to launch man on the\npath of counting. Indeed, the mathematical Leibniz saw in the mystic elegance\nof the binary system of _zero_ and _1_ the image of Creation. The unity of the\nSupreme Being operating in the void by binary function would, he felt, suffice\nto make all beings from the void.\n\nDantzig reminds us also that in the age of manuscript there was a chaotic\nvariety of signs for numerals, and that they did not assume a stable form\nuntil printing. Although this was one of the least of the cultural effects of\nprinting, it should serve to recall that one of the big factors in the Greek\nadoption of the letters of the phonetic alphabet was the prestige and currency\nof the number system of the Phoenician traders. The Romans got the Phoenician\nletters from the Greeks but retained a number system that was much more\nancient. Wayne and Shuster, the comedian team, never fail to get a good laugh\nwhen they line up a group of ancient Roman cops in togas and have them number\nthemselves from left to right, uttering Roman numerals. This joke demonstrates\nhow the pressure of numbers caused men to seek ever more streamlined methods\nof numeration. Before the advent of ordinal, successive, or positional\nnumbers, rulers had to count large bodies of soldiery by displacement methods.\nSometimes they were herded by groups into spaces of approximately known area.\nThe method of having them march in file and of dropping pebbles into\ncontainers was another method not unrelated to the abacus and the counting\nboard. Eventually the method of the counting board gave rise to the great\ndiscovery of the principle of position in the early centuries of our era. By\nsimply putting _3_ and _4_ and _2_ in position on the board, one after\nanother, it was possible to step up the speed and potential of calculation\nfantastically. The discovery of calculation by positional numbers rather than\nby merely additive numbers led, also, to the discovery of zero. Mere positions\nfor _3_ and _2_ on the board created ambiguities about whether the number was\n_32_ or _302_. The need was to have a sign for the gaps between numbers. It\nwas not till the thirteenth century that sifr, the Arab word for “gap” or\n“empty,” was Latinized and added to our culture as “cipher” (_ziphrium_) and\nfinally became the Italian _zero_. Zero really meant a positional gap. It did\nnot acquire the indispensable quality of “infinity” until the rise of\nperspective and “vanishing point” in Renaissance painting. The new visual\nspace of Renaissance painting affected number as much as lineal waiting had\ndone centuries earlier.\n\nA main fact about numbers has now been reached, with the link between the\nmedieval positional zero and the Renaissance vanishing point. That both\nvanishing point and infinity were unknown in the Greek and Roman cultures can\nbe explained as by-products of literacy. It was not until printing extended\nthe visual faculty into very high precision, uniformity, and intensity of\nspecial order that the other senses could be restrained or depressed\nsufficiently to create the new awareness of infinity. As one aspect of\nperspective and printing, mathematical or numerical infinity serves as an\ninstance of how our various physical extensions or media act upon one another\nthrough the agency of our own senses. It is in this mode that man appears as\nthe reproductive organ of the technological world, a fact that Samuel Butler\nbizarrely announced in Erewhon.\n\nThe effect of any kind of technology engenders a new equilibrium in us that\nbrings quite new technologies to birth, as we have just seen in the interplay\nof number (the tactile and quantitative form), and the more abstract forms of\nwritten or visual culture. Print technology transformed the medieval zero into\nthe Renaissance infinity, not only by convergence — perspective and vanishing\npoint — but by bringing into play for the first time in human history the\nfactor of exact repeatability. Print gave to men the concept of indefinite\nrepetition so necessary to the mathematical concept of infinity.\n\nThe same Gutenberg fact of uniform, continuous, and indefinitely repeatable\nbits inspired also the related concept of the infinitesimal calculus, by which\nit became possible to translate any kind of tricky space into the straight,\nthe flat, the uniform, and the “rational.” This concept of infinity was not\nimposed upon us by logic. It was the gift of Gutenberg. So, also, later on,\nwas the industrial assembly line. The power to translate knowledge into\nmechanical production by the breaking up of any process into fragmented\naspects to be placed in a lineal sequence of movable, yet uniform, parts was\nthe formal essence of the printing press. This amazing technique of spatial\nanalysis duplicating itself at once, by a kind of echo, invaded the world of\nnumber and touch.\n\nHere, then, is merely one familiar, if unrecognized, instance of the power of\none medium to translate itself into another medium. Since all media are\nextensions of our own bodies and senses, and since we habitually translate one\nsense into another in our own experience, it need not surprise us that our\nextended senses or technologies should repeat the process of translation and\nassimilation of one form into another. This process may well be inseparable\nfrom the character of touch, and from the abrasively interfaced action of\nsurfaces, whether in chemistry or crowds or technologies. The mysterious need\nof crowds to grow and to reach out, equally characteristic of large\naccumulations of wealth, can be understood if money and numbers are, indeed,\ntechnologies that extend the power of touch and the grasp of the hand. For\nnumbers, whether of people or of digits, and units of money would seem to\npossess the same factual magic for seizing and incorporating.\n\nThe Greeks ran head-on into the problem of translating their own new media\nwhen they tried to apply rational arithmetic to a problem in geometry. Up\narose the specter of Achilles and the tortoise. These attempts resulted in the\nfirst crisis in the history of our Western mathematics. Such a crisis\nconcerned the problems of determining the diagonal of a square and the\ncircumference of a circle: a clear case of number, the tactile sense, trying\nto cope with visual and pictorial space by reduction of the visual space to\nitself.\n\nFor the Renaissance, it was the infinitesimal calculus that enabled arithmetic\nto take over mechanics, physics, and geometry. The idea of an infinite but\ncontinuous and uniform process, so basic to the Gutenberg technology of\nmovable types, gave rise to the calculus. Banish the infinite process and\nmathematics, pure and applied, is reduced to the state known to the pre-\nPythagoreans. This is to say, banish the new medium of print with its\nfragmented technology of uniform, lineal repeatability, and modern mathematics\ndisappears. Apply, however, this infinite uniform process to finding the\nlength of an arc, and all that need be done is to inscribe in the arc a\nsequence of rectilinear contours of an increasing number of sides. When these\ncontours approach a limit, the length of the arc becomes the limit of this\nsequence. The older method of determining volumes by liquid displacement is\nthus translated into abstract visual terms by calculus. The principles\nregarding the concept of length apply also to notions of areas, volumes,\nmasses, moments, pressures, forces, stresses and strains, velocities and\naccelerations.\n\nThe miracle-maker, the sheer function of the infinitely fragmented and\nrepeatable, became the means of making visually flat, straight, and uniform\nall that was nonvisual: the skew, the curved, and the bumpy. In the same way,\nthe phonetic alphabet had, centuries before, invaded the discontinuous\ncultures of the barbarians, and translated their sinuosities and obtusities\ninto the uniformities of the visual culture of the Western world. It is this\nuniform, connected, and visual order that we still use as the norm of\n“rational” living. In our electric age of instant and non-visual forms of\ninterrelation, therefore, we find ourselves at a loss to define the\n“rational,” if only because we never noticed whence it came in the first\nplace.\n\n\n![Clothing: Our Extended Skin](images/title-12.png)\n\nEconomists have estimated that an unclad society eats 40 per cent more than\none in Western attire. Clothing as an extension of our skin helps to store and\nto channel energy, so that if the Westerner needs less food, he may also\ndemand more sex. Yet neither clothing nor sex can be understood as separate\nisolated factors, and many sociologists have noted that sex can become a\ncompensation for crowded living. Privacy, like individualism, is unknown in\ntribal societies, a fact that Westerners need to keep in mind when estimating\nthe attractions of our way of life to nonliterate peoples.\n\nClothing, as an extension of the skin, can be seen both as a heat-control\nmechanism and as a means of defining the self socially. In these respects,\nclothing and housing are near twins, though clothing is both nearer and elder;\nfor housing extends the inner heat-control mechanisms of our organism, while\nclothing is a more direct extension of the outer surface of the body. Today\nEuropeans have begun to dress for the eye, American-style, just at the moment\nwhen Americans have begun to abandon their traditional visual style. The media\nanalyst knows why these opposite styles suddenly transfer their locations. The\nEuropean, since the Second War, has begun to stress visual values; his\neconomy, not coincidentally, now supports a large amount of uniform consumer\ngoods. Americans, on the other hand, have begun to rebel against uniform\nconsumer values for the first time. In cars, in clothes, in paperback books;\nin beards, babies, and beehive hairdos, the American has declared for stress\non touch, on participation, involvement, and sculptural values. America, once\nthe land of an abstractly visual order, is profoundly “in touch” again with\nEuropean traditions of food and life and art. What was an _avant-garde_\nprogram for the 1920 expatriates is now the teenagers’ norm.\n\nThe Europeans, however, underwent a sort of consumer revolution at the end of\nthe eighteenth century. When industrialism was a novelty, it became\nfashionable among the upper classes to abandon rich, courtly attire in favor\nof simpler materials. That was the time when men first donned the trousers of\nthe common foot soldier (or _pioneer_ , the original French usage), but it was\ndone at that time as a kind of brash gesture of social “integration.” Up until\nthen, the feudal system had inclined the upper classes to dress as they spoke,\nin a courtly style quite removed from that of ordinary people. Dress and\nspeech were accorded a degree of splendor and richness of texture that\nuniversal literacy and mass production were eventually to eliminate\ncompletely. The sewing machine, for example, created the long straight line in\nclothes, as much as the linotype flattened the human vocal style.\n\nA recent ad for C-E-I-R Computer Services pictured a plain cotton dress and\nthe headline: \"“Why does Mrs. ‘K’ dress that way?”\" — referring to the wife of\nNikita Khrushchev. Some of the copy of this very ingenious ad continued: \"“It\nis an icon. To its own underprivileged population and to the uncommitted of\nthe East and South, it says: ‘We are thrif-ty, simple, hon-est; peaceful,\nhome-y, go-od.’ To the free nations of the West it says: ‘We will bury you.’”\"\n\nThis is precisely the message that the new simple clothing of our forefathers\nhad for the feudal classes at the time of the French Revolution. Clothing was\nthen a nonverbal manifesto of political upset.\n\nToday in America there is a revolutionary attitude expressed as much in our\nattire as in our patios and small cars. For a decade and more, women’s dress\nand hair styles have abandoned visual for iconic — or sculptural and tactual —\nstress. Like toreador pants and gaiter stockings, the beehive hairdo is also\niconic and sensuously inclusive, rather than abstractly visual. In a word, the\nAmerican woman for the first time presents herself as a person to be touched\nand handled, not just to be looked at. While the Russians are groping vaguely\ntoward visual consumer values, North Americans are frolicking amidst newly\ndiscovered tactile, sculptural spaces in cars, clothes, and housing. For this\nreason, it is relatively easy for us now to recognize clothing as an extension\nof the skin. In the age of the bikini and of skin-diving, we begin to\nunderstand “the castle of our skin” as a space and world of its own. Gone are\nthe thrills of strip-tease. Nudity could be naughty excitement only for a\nvisual culture that had divorced itself from the audile-tactile values of less\nabstract societies. As late as 1930, four-letter words made visual on the\nprinted page seemed portentous. Words that most people used every hour of the\nday became as frantic as nudity, when printed. Most “four-letter words” are\nheavy with tactile-involving stress. For this reason they seem earthy and\nvigorous to visual man. So it is with nudity. To backward cultures still\nembedded in the full gamut of sense-life, not yet abstracted by literacy and\nindustrial visual order, nudity is merely pathetic. The Kinsey Report on the\nsex life of the male expressed bafflement that peasants and backward peoples\ndid not relish marital or boudoir nudity. Khrushchev did not enjoy the can-can\ndance provided for his entertainment in Hollywood. Naturally not. That sort of\nmime of sense involvement is meaningful only to long-literate societies.\nBackward peoples approach nudity, if at all, with the attitude we have come to\nexpect from our painters and sculptors — the attitude made up of all the\nsenses at once. To a person using the whole sensorium, nudity is the richest\npossible expression of structural form. But to the highly visual and lopsided\nsensibility of industrial societies, the sudden confrontation with tactile\nflesh is heady music, indeed.\n\nThere is a movement toward a new equilibrium today, as we become aware of the\npreference for coarse, heavy textures and sculptural shapes in dress. There\nis, also, the ritualistic exposure of the body indoors and out-of-doors.\nPsychologists have long taught us that much of our hearing takes place through\nthe skin itself. After centuries of being fully clad and of being contained in\nuniform visual space, the electric age ushers us into a world in which we live\nand breathe and listen with the entire epidermis. Of course, there is much\nzest of novelty in this cult, and the eventual equilibrium among the senses\nwill slough off a good deal of the new ritual, both in clothing and in\nhousing. Meantime, in both new attire and new dwellings, our unified\nsensibility cavorts amidst a wide range of awareness of materials and colors\nwhich makes ours one of the greatest ages of music, poetry, painting, and\narchitecture alike.\n\n\n![Housing: New Look and New Outlook](images/title-13.png)\n\nIf clothing is an extension of our private skins to store and channel our own\nheat and energy, housing is a collective means of achieving the same end for\nthe family or the group. Housing as shelter is an extension of our bodily\nheat-control mechanisms—a collective skin or garment. Cities are an even\nfurther extension of bodily organs to accommodate the needs of large groups.\nMany readers are familiar with the way in which James Joyce organized Ulysses\nby assigning the various city forms of walls, streets, civic buildings, and\nmedia to the various bodily organs. Such a parallel between the city and the\nhuman body enabled Joyce to establish a further parallel between ancient\nIthaca and modern Dublin, creating a sense of human unity in depth,\ntranscending history.\n\nBaudelaire originally intended to call his Fleurs du Mal, Les Limbes, having\nin mind the city as corporate extensions of our physical organs. Our letting-\ngo of ourselves, self-alienations, as it were, in order to amplify or increase\nthe power of various functions, Baudelaire considered to be flowers of growths\nof evil. The city as amplification of human lusts and sensual striving had for\nhim an entire organic and psychic unity.\n\nLiterate man, civilized man, tends to restrict and enclose space and to\nseparate functions, whereas tribal man had freely extended the form of his\nbody to include the universe. Acting as an organ of the cosmos, tribal man\naccepted his bodily functions as modes of participation in the divine\nenergies. The human body in Indian religious thought was ritually related to\nthe cosmic image, and this in turn was assimilated into the form of house.\nHousing was an image of both the body and the universe for tribal and\nnonliterate societies. The building of the house with its hearth as fire-altar\nwas ritually associated with the act of creation. This same ritual was even\nmore deeply embedded in the building of the ancient cities, their shape and\nprocess having been deliberately modeled as an act of divine praise. The city\nand the home in the tribal world (as in China and India today) can be accepted\nas iconic embodiments of the _word_ , the divine _mythos_ , the universal\naspiration. Even in our present electric age, many people yearn for this\ninclusive strategy of acquiring significance for their own private and\nisolated beings.\n\nLiterate man, once having accepted an analytic technology of fragmentation, is\nnot nearly so accessible to cosmic patterns as tribal man. He prefers\nseparateness and compartmented spaces, rather than the open cosmos. He becomes\nless inclined to accept his body as a model of the universe, or to see his\nhouse — or any other of the media of communication, for that matter — as a\nritual extension of his body. Once men have adopted the visual dynamic of the\nphonetic alphabet, they begin to lose the tribal man’s obsession with cosmic\norder and ritual as recurrent in the physical organs and their social\nextension. Indifference to the cosmic, however, fosters intense concentration\non minute segments and specialist tasks, which is the unique strength of\nWestern man. For the specialist is one who never makes small mistakes while\nmoving toward the grand fallacy.\n\nMen live in round houses until they become sedentary and specialized in their\nwork organization. Anthropologists have often noted this change from round to\nsquare without knowing its cause. The media analyst can help the\nanthropologist in this matter, although the explanation will not be obvious to\npeople of visual culture. The visual man, likewise, cannot see much difference\nbetween the motion picture and TV, or between a Corvair and a Volkswagen, for\nthis difference is not between two visual spaces, but between tactile and\nvisual ones. A tent or a wigwam is not an enclosed or visual space. Neither is\na cave nor a hole in the ground. These kinds of space — the tent, the wigwam,\nthe igloo, the cave — are not “enclosed” in the visual sense because they\nfollow dynamic lines of force, like a triangle. When enclosed, or translated\ninto visual space, architecture tends to lose its tactile kinetic pressure. A\nsquare is the enclosure of a visual space; that is, it consists of space\nproperties abstracted from manifest tensions. A triangle follows lines of\nforce, this being the most economical way of anchoring a vertical object. A\nsquare moves beyond such kinetic pressures to enclose visual space relations,\nwhile depending upon diagonal anchors. This separation of the visual from\ndirect tactile and kinetic pressure, and its translation into new dwelling\nspaces, occurs only when men have learned to practice specialization of their\nsenses, and fragmentation of their work skills. The square room or house\nspeaks the language of the sedentary specialist, while the round hut or igloo,\nlike the conical wigwam, tells of the integral nomadic ways of food-gathering\ncommunities.\n\nThis entire discussion is offered at considerable risk of misapprehension\nbecause these are, spatially, highly technical matters. Nevertheless, when\nsuch spaces are understood, they offer the key to a great many enigmas, past\nand present. They explain the change from circular-dome architecture to gothic\nforms, a change occasioned by alteration in the ratio or proportion of the\nsense lives in the members of a society. Such a shift occurs with the\nextension of the body in new social technology and invention. A new extension\nsets up a new equilibrium among all of the senses and faculties leading, as we\nsay, to a “new outlook”—new attitudes and preferences in many areas.\n\nIn the simplest terms, as already noted, housing is an effort to extend the\nbody’s heat-control mechanism. Clothing tackles the problem more directly but\nless fundamentally, and privately rather than socially. Both clothing and\nhousing store warmth and energy and make these readily accessible for the\nexecution of many tasks otherwise impossible. In making heat and energy\naccessible socially, to the family or the group, housing fosters new skills\nand new learning, performing the basic functions of all other media. Heat\ncontrol is the key factor in housing, as well as in clothing. The Eskimo’s\ndwelling is a good example. The Eskimo can go for days without food at 50\ndegrees below zero. The unclad native, deprived of nourishment, dies in a few\nhours.\n\nIt may surprise many to learn that the primitive shape of the igloo is,\nnonetheless, traceable to the primus stove. Eskimos have lived for ages in\nround stone houses, and, for the most part, still do. The igloo, made of snow\nblocks, is a fairly recent development in the life of this stone-age people.\nTo live in such structures became possible with the coming of the white man\nand his portable stove. The igloo is an ephemeral shelter, devised for\ntemporary use by trappers. The Eskimo became a trapper only after he had made\ncontact with the white man; up until then he had been simply a food-gatherer.\nLet the igloo serve as an example of the way in which a new pattern is\nintroduced into an ancient way of life by the intensification of a single\nfactor — in this instance, artificial heat. In the same way, the\nintensification of a single factor in our complex lives leads naturally to a\nnew balance among our technologically extended faculties, resulting in a new\nlook and a new “outlook” with new motivations and inventions.\n\nIn the twentieth century we are familiar with the changes in housing and\narchitecture that are the result of electric energy made available to\nelevators. The same energy devoted to lighting has altered our living and\nworking spaces even more radically. Electric light abolished the divisions of\nnight and day, of inner and outer, and of the subterranean and the\nterrestrial. It altered every consideration of space for work and production\nas much as the other electric media had altered the space-time experience of\nsociety. All this is reasonably familiar. Less familiar is the architectural\nrevolution made possible by improvements in heating centuries ago. With the\nmining of coal on a large scale in the Renaissance, inhabitants in the colder\nclimates discovered great new resources of personal energy. New means of\nheating permitted the manufacture of glass and the enlargement of living\nquarters and the raising of ceilings. The Burgher house of the Renaissance\nbecame at once bedroom, kitchen, workshop, and sale outlet.\n\nOnce housing is seen as group (or corporate) clothing and heat control, the\nnew means of heating can be understood as causing change in spatial form.\nLighting, however, is almost as decisive as heating in causing these changes\nin architectural and city spaces. That is the reason why the story of glass is\nso closely related to the history of housing. The story of the mirror is a\nmain chapter in the history of dress and manners and the sense of the self.\n\nRecently an imaginative school principal in a slum area provided each student\nin the school with a photograph of himself. The classrooms of the school were\nabundantly supplied with large mirrors. The result was an astounding increase\nin the learning rate. The slum child has ordinarily very little visual\norientation. He does not see himself as becoming something. He does not\nenvisage distant goals and objectives. He is deeply involved in his own world\nfrom day to day, and can establish no beachhead in the highly specialized\nsense life of visual man. The plight of the slum child, via the TV image, is\nincreasingly extended to the entire population.\n\nClothing and housing, as extensions of skin and heat-control mechanisms, are\nmedia of communication, first of all, in the sense that they shape and\nrearrange the patterns of human association and community. Varied techniques\nof lighting and heating would seem only to give new flexibility and scope to\nwhat is the basic principle of these media of clothing and housing; namely,\ntheir extension of our bodily heat-control mechanisms in a way that enables us\nto attain some degree of equilibrium in a changing environment.\n\nModern engineering provides means of housing that range from the space capsule\nto walls created by air jets. Some firms now specialize in providing large\nbuildings with inside walls and floors that can be moved at will. Such\nflexibility naturally tends toward the organic. Human sensitivity seems once\nmore to be attuned to the universal currents that made of tribal man a cosmic\nskin-diver.\n\nIt is not only the Ulysses of James Joyce that testifies to this trend. Recent\nstudies of the Gothic churches have stressed the organic aims of their\nbuilders. The saints took the body seriously as the symbolic vesture of the\nspirit, and they regarded the Church as a second body, viewing its every\ndetail with great completeness. Before James Joyce provided his detailed image\nof the metropolis as a second body, Baudelaire had provided a similar\n“dialogue” between the parts of the body extended to form the metropolis, in\nhis Fleurs du Mal.\n\nElectric lighting has brought into the cultural complex of the extensions of\nman in housing and city, an organic flexibility unknown to any other age. If\ncolor photography has created “museums without walls,” how much more has\nelectric lighting created space without walls, and day without night. Whether\nin the night city, the night highway, or the night ball game, sketching and\nwriting with light have moved from the domain of the pictorial photograph to\nthe live, dynamic spaces created by out-of-door lighting.\n\nNot many ages ago, glass windows were unknown luxuries. With light control by\nglass came also a means of controlling the regularity of domestic routine, and\nsteady application to crafts and trade without regard to cold or rain. The\nworld was put in a frame. With electric light not only can we carry out the\nmost precise operations with no regard for time or place or climate, but we\ncan photograph the submicroscopic as easily as we can enter the subterranean\nworld of the mine and of the cave-painters.\n\nLighting as an extension of our powers affords the clearest-cut example of how\nsuch extensions alter our perceptions. If people are inclined to doubt whether\nthe wheel or typography or the plane could change our habits of sense\nperception, their doubts end with electric lighting. In this domain, the\nmedium is the message, and when the light is on there is a world of sense that\ndisappears when the light is off.\n\n“Painting with light” is jargon from the world of stage-electricity. The uses\nof light in the world of motion, whether in the motorcar or the movie or the\nmicroscope, are as diverse as the uses of electricity in the world of power.\nLight is information without “content,” much as the missile is a vehicle\nwithout the additions of wheel or highway. As the missile is a self-contained\ntransportation system that consumes not only its fuel but its engine, so light\nis a self-contained communication system in which the medium is the message.\n\nThe recent development of the laser ray has introduced new possibilities for\nlight. The laser ray is an amplification of light by intensified radiation.\nConcentration of radiant energy has made available some new properties in\nlight. The laser ray — by thickening light, as it were — enables it to be\nmodulated to carry information as do radio waves. But because of its greater\nintensity, a single laser beam can carry as much information as all the\ncombined radio and TV channels in the United States. Such beams are not within\nthe range of vision, and may well have a military future as lethal agents.\n\nFrom the air at night, the seeming chaos of the urban area manifests itself as\na delicate embroidery on a dark velvet ground. Gyorgy Kepes has developed\nthese aerial effects of the city at night as a new art form of “landscape by\nlight through” rather than “light on.” His new electric landscapes have\ncomplete congruity with the TV image, which also exists by light _through_\nrather than by light on.\n\nThe French painter André Girard began painting directly on film before the\nphotographic movies became popular. In that early phase it was easy to\nspeculate about “painting with light” and about introducing movement into the\nart of painting. Said Girard:\n\n> I would not be surprised if, fifty years from now, almost no one would pay\n> attention to paintings whose subjects remain _still_ in their always too-\n> narrow frames.\n\nThe coming of TV inspired him anew:\n\n> Once I saw suddenly, in a control room, the sensitive eye of the camera\n> presenting to me, one after another, the faces, the landscapes, the\n> expressions of a big painting of mine in an order which I had never thought\n> of. I had the feeling of a composer listening to one of his operas, all\n> scenes mixed up in an order different from the one he wrote. It was like\n> seeing a building from a fast elevator that showed you the roof before the\n> basement, and made quick stops at some floors but not others.\n\nSince that phase, Girard has worked out new techniques of control for painting\nwith light in association with CBS and NBC technicians. The relevance of his\nwork for housing is that it enables us to conceive of totally new\npossibilities for architectural and artistic modulation of space. Painting\nwith light is a kind of housing-without-walls. The same electric technology,\nextended to the job of providing global thermostatic controls, points to the\nobsolescence of housing as an extension of the heat-control mechanisms of the\nbody. It is equally conceivable that the electric extension of the process of\ncollective consciousness, in making consciousness-without-walls, might render\nlanguage walls obsolescent. Languages are stuttering extensions of our five\nsenses, in varying ratios and wavelengths. An immediate simulation of\nconsciousness would by-pass speech in a kind of massive extrasensory\nperception, just as global thermostats could by-pass those extensions of skin\nand body that we call houses. Such an extension of the process of\nconsciousness by electric simulation may easily occur in the 1960s.\n\n  *[CBS]: Columbia Broadcasting System\n  *[NBC]: National Broadcasting Company\n\n\n![Money: The Poor Man’s Credit Card](images/title-14.png)\n\nCentral to modern psychoanalytical theory is the relation between the money\ncomplex and the human body. Some analysts derive money from the infantile\nimpulse to play with feces. Ferenczi, in particular, calls money \"“nothing\nother than odorless dehydrated filth that has been made to shine.”\" Ferenczi,\nin his concept of money, is elaborating Freud’s concept of \"“Character and\nAnal Erotism.”\" Although this idea of linking “filthy lucre” with the anal has\ncontinued in the main lines of psychoanalysis, it does not correspond\nsufficiently to the nature and function of money in society to provide a theme\nfor the present chapter.\n\nMoney began in nonliterate cultures as a commodity, such as whales’ teeth on\nFiji; or rats on Easter Island, which later were considered a delicacy, were\nvalued as a luxury, and thus became a means of mediation or barter. When the\nSpaniards were besieging Leyden in 1574, leather money was issued, but as\nhardship increased the population boiled and ate the new currency.\n\nIn literate cultures, circumstances may reintroduce commodity money. The\nDutch, after the German occupation of World War II, were avid for tobacco.\nSince the supply was small, objects of high value such as jewels, precision\ninstruments, and even houses were sold for small quantities of cigarettes. The\nReader’s Digest recorded an episode from the early occupation of Europe in\n1945, describing how an unopened pack of cigarettes served as currency,\npassing from hand to hand, translating the skill of one worker into the skill\nof another as long as no one broke the seal.\n\nMoney always retains something of its commodity and community character. In\nthe beginning, its function of extending the grasp of men from their nearest\nstaples and commodities to more distant ones is very slight. Increased\nmobility of grasp and trading is small at first. So it is with the emergence\nof language in the child. In the first months grasping is reflexive, and the\npower to make voluntary release comes only toward the end of the first year.\nSpeech comes with the development of the power to let go of objects. It gives\nthe power of detachment from the environment that is also the power of great\nmobility in knowledge of the environment. So it is with the growth of the idea\nof money as currency rather than commodity. Currency is a way of letting go of\nthe immediate staples and commodities that at first serve as money, in order\nto extend trading to the whole social complex. Trading by currency is based on\nthe principle of grasping and letting go in an oscillating cycle. The one hand\nretains the article with which it tempts the other party. The other hand is\nextended in demand toward the object which is desired in exchange. The first\nhand lets go as soon as the second object is touched, somewhat in the manner\nof a trapeze artist exchanging one bar for another. In fact, Elias Canetti in\nCrowds and Power argues that the trader is involved in one of the most ancient\nof all pastimes, namely that of climbing trees and swinging from limb to limb.\nThe primitive grasping, calculating, and timing of the greater arboreal apes\nhe sees as a translation into financial terms of one of the oldest movement\npatterns. Just as the hand among the branches of the trees learned a pattern\nof grasping that was quite removed from the moving of food to mouth, so the\ntrader and the financier have developed enthralling abstract activities that\nare extensions of the avid climbing and mobility of the greater apes.\n\nLike any other medium, it is a staple, a natural resource. As an outward and\nvisible form of the urge to change and to exchange, it is a corporate image,\ndepending on society for its institutional status. Apart from communal\nparticipation, money is meaningless, as Robinson Crusoe discovered when he\nfound the coins in the wrecked ship:\n\n> I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. “O drug!” said I aloud, “What\n> are thou good for? Thou art not worth to me—no, not the taking off the\n> ground: one of those knives is worth all this heap: I have no manner of use\n> for thee; e’en remain where thou art and, go to the bottom, as a creature\n> whose life is not worth saving.”\n>\n> However, upon second thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping it all in a\n> piece of canvas, I began to think of making another raft …\n\nPrimitive commodity money, like the magical words of nonliterate society, can\nbe a storehouse of power, and has often become the occasion of feverish\neconomic activity. The natives of the South Seas, when they are so engaged,\nseek no economic advantage. Furious application to production may be followed\nby deliberate destruction of the products in order to achieve moral prestige.\nEven in these “potlatch” cultures, however, the effect of the currencies was\nto expedite and to accelerate human energies in a way that had become\nuniversal in the ancient world with the technology of the phonetic alphabet.\nMoney, like writing, has the power to specialize and to rechannel human\nenergies and to separate functions, just as it translates and reduces one kind\nof work to another. Even in the electronic age it has lost none of this power.\n\nPotlatch is very widespread, especially where there is ease of food-gathering\nor food-production. For example, among the Northwest coast fishermen, or rice-\nplanters of Borneo, huge surpluses are produced that have to be destroyed or\nclass differences would arise that would destroy the traditional social order.\nIn Borneo the traveler may see tons of rice exposed to rains in rituals, and\ngreat art constructions, involving tremendous efforts, smashed.\n\nAt the same time, in these primitive societies, while money may release\nfrantic energies in order to charge a bit of copper with magical prestige, it\ncan buy very little. Rich and poor necessarily live in much the same manner.\nToday, in the electronic age, the richest man is reduced to having much the\nsame entertainment, and even the same food and vehicles as the ordinary man.\n\nThe use of a commodity such as money naturally increases its production. The\nnonspecialist economy of Virginia in the seventeenth century made the\nelaborate European currencies quite dispensable. Having little capital, and\nwishing to put as little of this capital as possible into the shape of money,\nthe Virginians turned to commodity money in some instances. When a commodity\nlike tobacco was legislated into legal tender, it had the effect of\nstimulating the production of tobacco, just as the establishment of metallic\ncurrencies advanced the mining of metals.\n\nMoney, as a social means of extending and amplifying work and skill in an\neasily accessible and portable form, lost much of its magical power with the\ncoming of representative money, or paper money. Just as speech lost its magic\nwith writing, and further with printing, when printed money supplanted gold,\nthe compelling aura of it disappeared. Samuel Butler in Erewhon (1872) gave\nclear indications in his treatment of the mysterious prestige conferred by\nprecious metals. His ridicule of the money medium took the form of presenting\nthe old reverent attitude to money in a new social context. This new kind of\nabstract, printed money of the high industrial age, however, simply would not\nsustain the old attitude:\n\n> This is the true philanthropy. He who makes a colossal fortune in the\n> hosiery trade, and by his energy has succeeded in reducing the price of\n> woollen goods by the thousandth part of a penny in the pound — this man is\n> worth ten professional philanthropists. So strongly are the Erewhonians\n> impressed with this, that if a man has made a fortune of over £20,000 a year\n> they exempt him from all taxation, considering him a work of art, and too\n> precious to be meddled with; they say, \"“How very much he must have done for\n> society before society could have been prevailed upon to give him so much\n> money”\"; so magnificent an organization overawes them; they regard it as a\n> thing dropped from heaven.\n>\n> \"“Money,”\" they say, \"“is the symbol of duty, it is the sacrament of having\n> done for mankind that which mankind wanted. Mankind may not be a very good\n> judge, but there is no better.”\" This used to shock me at first, when I\n> remembered that it had been said on high authority that they who have riches\n> shall enter hardly into the kingdom of heaven; but the influence of Erewhon\n> had made me begin to see things in a new light, and I could not help\n> thinking that they who have not riches shall enter more hardly still.\n\nEarlier in the book, Butler had ridiculed the cash-register morality and\nreligion of an industrialized world, under the guise of the “Musical Banks,”\nwith clergy in the role of cashiers. In the present passage, he perceives\nmoney as \"“the sacrament of having done for mankind that which mankind\nwanted.”\" Money, he is saying, is the \"“outward and visible sign of an inward\nand invisible grace.”\"\n\nMoney as a social medium or extension of an inner wish and motive creates\nsocial and spiritual values, as happens even in fashions in women’s dress. A\ncurrent ad underlines this aspect of dress as currency (that is, as social\nsacrament or outward and visible sign): \"“The important thing in today’s world\nof fashion is to appear to be wearing a popular fabric.”\" Conformity to this\nfashion literally gives _currency_ to a style or fabric, creating a social\nmedium that increases wealth and expression thereby. Does not this stress how\nmoney, or any medium whatever, is constituted and made efficacious? When men\nbecome uneasy about such social values achieved by uniformity and repetition,\ndoing for mankind that which mankind wants, we can take it as a mark of the\ndecline of mechanical technology.\n\n“Money talks” because money is a metaphor, a transfer, and a bridge. Like\nwords and language, money is a storehouse of communally achieved work, skill,\nand experience. Money, however, is also a specialist technology like writing;\nand as writing intensifies the visual aspect of speech and order, and as the\nclock visually separates time from space, so money separates work from the\nother social functions. Even today money is a language for translating the\nwork of the farmer into the work of the barber, doctor, engineer, or plumber.\nAs a vast social metaphor, bridge, or translator, money — like writing —\nspeeds up exchange and tightens the bonds of interdependence in any community.\nIt gives great spatial extension and control to political organizations, just\nas writing does, or the calendar. It is action at a distance, both in space\nand in time. In a highly literate, fragmented society, “Time is money,” and\nmoney is the store of other people’s time and effort.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the idea of the _fisc_ or “the King’s purse” kept the\nnotion of money in relation to language (“the King’s English”) and to\ncommunication by travel (“the King’s highway”). Before the advent of printing,\nit was quite natural for the means of communication to be regarded as\nextensions of a single body. In an increasingly literate society, money and\nthe clock assumed a high degree of visual or fragmented stress. In practice,\nour Western use of money as store and translator of communal work and skill\nhas depended upon long accustomation to the written word, and upon the power\nof the written word to specialize, to delegate, and to separate functions in\nan organization.\n\nWhen we look at the nature and uses of money in nonliterate societies, we can\nbetter understand the ways in which writing helps to establish currencies.\nUniformity of commodities, combined with a fixed-price system such as we now\ntake for granted, does not become possible until printing prepares the ground.\n“Backward” countries take a long time to reach economic “take-off” because\nthey do not undergo the extensive processing of print with its psychological\nconditioning in the ways of uniformity and repeatability. In general, the West\nis little aware of the way in which the world of prices and numbering is\nsupported by the pervasive visual culture of literacy.\n\nNonliterate societies are quite lacking in the psychic resources to create and\nsustain the enormous structures of statistical information that we call\nmarkets and prices. Far easier is the organization of production than is the\ntraining of whole populations in the habits of translating their wishes and\ndesires statistically, as it were, by means of market mechanisms of supply and\ndemand, and the visual technology of prices. It was only in the eighteenth\ncentury that the West began to accept this form of extension of its inner life\nin the new statistical pattern of marketing. So bizarre did this new mechanism\nappear to thinkers of that time that they called it a “Hedonistic calculus.”\nPrices then seemed to be comparable, in terms of feelings and desires, to the\nvast world of space that had yielded its inequities earlier to the translating\npower of the differential calculus. In a word, the fragmentation of the inner\nlife by prices seemed as mysterious in the eighteenth century, as the minute\nfragmentation of space by means of calculus had seemed a century earlier.\n\nThe extreme abstraction and detachment represented by our pricing system is\nquite unthinkable and unusable amidst populations for whom the exciting drama\nof price haggling occurs with every transaction.\n\nToday, as the new vortices of power are shaped by the instant electric\ninterdependence of all men on this planet, the visual factor in social\norganization and in personal experience recedes and money begins to be less\nand less a means of storing or exchanging work and skill. Automation, which is\nelectronic, does not represent physical work so much as programmed knowledge.\nAs work is replaced by the sheer movement of information, money as a store of\nwork merges with the informational forms of credit and credit card. From coin\nto paper currency, and from currency to credit card there is a steady\nprogression toward commercial exchange as the movement of information itself.\nThis trend toward an inclusive information is the kind of image represented by\nthe credit card, and approaches once more the character of tribal money. For\ntribal society, not knowing the specialisms of job or of work, does not\nspecialize money either. Its money can be eaten, drunk, or worn like the new\nspace ships that are now designed to be edible.\n\n“Work,” however, does not exist in a nonliterate world. The primitive hunter\nor fisherman did no work, any more than does the poet, painter, or thinker of\ntoday. Where the whole man is involved there is no work. Work begins with the\ndivision of labor and the specialization of functions and tasks in sedentary,\nagricultural communities. In the computer age we are once more totally\ninvolved in our roles. In the electric age the “job of work” yields to\ndedication and commitment, as in the tribe.\n\nIn nonliterate societies money relates itself to the other organs of society\nquite simply. The role of money is enormously increased after money begins to\nfoster specialism and separation of social functions. Money becomes, in fact,\nthe principal means of interrelating the ever more specialist activities of\nliterate society. The fragmenting power of the visual sense, as literacy\nseparates it from the other senses, is a fact more easily identified now in\nthe electronic age. Nowadays, with computers and electric programming, the\nmeans of storing and moving information become less and less visual and\nmechanical, while increasingly integral and organic. The total field created\nby the instantaneous electric forms cannot be visualized any more than the\nvelocities of electronic particles can be visualized. The instantaneous\ncreates an interplay among time and space and human occupations, for which the\nolder forms of currency exchange become increasingly inadequate. A modern\nphysicist who attempted to employ visual models of perception in organizing\natomic data would not be able to get anywhere near the nature of his problems.\nBoth time (as measured visually and segmentally) and space (as uniform,\npictorial, and enclosed) disappear in the electronic age of instant\ninformation. In the age of instant information man ends his job of fragmented\nspecializing and assumes the role of information-gathering. Today information-\ngathering resumes the inclusive concept of “culture” exactly as the primitive\nfood-gatherer worked in complete equilibrium with his entire environment. Our\nquarry now, in this new nomadic and “workless” world, is knowledge and insight\ninto the creative processes of life and society.\n\nMen left the closed world of the tribe for the “open society,” exchanging an\near for an eye by means of the technology of writing. The alphabet in\nparticular enabled them to break out of the charmed circle and resonating\nmagic of the tribal world. A similar process of economic change from the\nclosed to the open society, from mercantilism and the economic protection of\nnational trade to the open market ideal of the free-traders, was accomplished\nin more recent times by means of the printed word, and by moving from metallic\nto paper currencies. Today, electric technology puts the very concept of money\nin jeopardy, as the new dynamics of human interdependence shift from\nfragmenting media such as printing to inclusive or mass media like the\ntelegraph.\n\nSince all media are extensions of ourselves, or translations of some part of\nus into various materials, any study of one medium helps us to understand all\nthe others. Money is no exception. The primitive or nonliterate use of money\nis especially enlightening, since it manifests an easy acceptance of staple\nproducts as media of communication. The nonliterate man can accept any staple\nas money, partly because the staples of a community are as much media of\ncommunication as they are commodities. Cotton, wheat, cattle, tobacco, timber,\nfish, fur, and many other products have acted as major shaping forces of\ncommunity life in many cultures. When one of these staples becomes dominant as\na social bond, it serves, also, as a store of value, and as a translator or\nexchanger of skills and tasks.\n\nThe classic curse of Midas, his power of translating all he touched into gold,\nis in some degree the character of any medium, including language. This myth\ndraws attention to a magic aspect of all extensions of human sense and body;\nthat is, to all technology whatever. All technology has the Midas touch. When\na community develops some extension of itself, it tends to allow all other\nfunctions to be altered to accommodate that form.\n\nLanguage, like currency, acts as a store of perception and as a transmitter of\nthe perceptions and experience of one person or of one generation to another.\nAs both a translator and storehouse of experience, language is, in addition, a\nreducer and a distorter of experience. The very great advantage of\naccelerating the learning process, and of making possible the transmission of\nknowledge and insight across time and space, easily overrides the\ndisadvantages of linguistic codifications of experience. In modern mathematics\nand science there are increasingly more and more nonverbal ways of codifying\nexperience.\n\nMoney, like language a store of work and experience, acts also as translator\nand transmitter. Especially since the written word has advanced the separation\nof social functions, money is able to move away from its role as store of\nwork. This role is obvious when a staple or commodity like cattle or fur is\nused as money. As money separates itself from the commodity form and becomes a\nspecialist agent of exchange (or translator of values), it moves with greater\nspeed and in ever greater volume.\n\nEven in recent times, the dramatic arrival of paper currency, or\n“representative money,” as a substitute for commodity money caused confusions.\nMuch in the same way, the Gutenberg technology created a vast new republic of\nletters, and stirred great confusion about the boundaries between the realms\nof literature and life. Representative money, based on print technology,\ncreated new speedy dimensions of credit that were quite inconsistent with the\ninert mass of bullion and of commodity money. Yet all efforts were bent to\nmake the speedy new money behave like the slow bullion coach. J. M. Keynes\nstated this policy in A Treatise on Money:\n\n> Thus the long age of Commodity Money has at last passed finally away before\n> the age of Representative Money. Gold has ceased to be a coin, a hoard, a\n> tangible claim to wealth, of which the value cannot slip away so long as the\n> hand of the individual clutches the material stuff. It has become a much\n> more abstract thing — just a standard of value; and it only keeps this\n> nominal status by being handed round from time to time in quite small\n> quantities amongst a group of Central Banks, on the occasions when one of\n> them has been inflating or deflating its managed representative money in a\n> different degree from what is appropriate to the behavior of its neighbors.\n\nPaper, or representative money, has specialized itself away from the ancient\nrole of money as a store of work into the equally ancient and basic function\nof money as transmitter and expediter of any kind of work into any other kind.\nJust as the alphabet was a drastic visual abstraction from the rich\nhieroglyphic culture of the Egyptians, so it also reduced and translated that\nculture into the great visual vortex of the Graeco-Roman world. The alphabet\nis a one-way process of reduction of nonliterate cultures into the specialist\nvisual fragments of our Western world. Money is an adjunct of that specialist\nalphabetic technology, raising even the Gutenberg form of mechanical\nrepeatability to new intensity. As the alphabet neutralized the divergencies\nof primitive cultures by translation of their complexities into simple visual\nterms, so representative money reduced moral values in the nineteenth century.\nAs paper expedited the power of the alphabet to reduce the oral barbarians to\nRoman uniformity of civilization, so paper money enabled Western industry to\nblanket the globe.\n\nShortly before the advent of paper money, the greatly increased volume of\ninformation movement in European newsletters and newspapers created the image\nand concept of National Credit. Such a corporate image of credit depended,\nthen as now, on the fast and comprehensive information movement that we have\ntaken for granted for two centuries and more. At that stage of the emergence\nof public credit, money assumed the further role of translating, not just\nlocal, but national stores of work from one culture to another.\n\nOne of the inevitable results of acceleration of information movement and of\nthe translating power of money is the opportunity of enrichment for those who\ncan anticipate this transformation by a few hours or years, as the case may\nbe. We are particularly familiar today with examples of enrichment by means of\nadvance information in stocks and bonds and real estate. In the past, when\nwealth was not so obviously related to information, an entire social class\ncould monopolize the wealth resulting from a casual shift in technology.\nKeynes’ report of just such an instance, in his study of \"“Shakespeare and the\nProfit Inflations,”\" explains that since new wealth and bullion fall first to\nthe governing classes, they experience a sudden buoyancy and euphoria, a glad\nrelease from the habitual stress and anxieties that fosters a prosperity,\nwhich in turn inspires the starving artist in his garret to invent new\ntriumphant rhythms and exultant forms of painting and poetry. As long as\nprofits leap well ahead of wages, the governing class cavorts in a style that\ninspires the greatest conceptions in the bosom of the impecunious artist.\nWhen, however, profits and wages keep in reasonable touch, this abounding joy\nof the governing class is correspondingly diminished, and art then cannot\nbenefit from prosperity.\n\nKeynes discovered the dynamics of money as a medium. The real task of a study\nof this one medium is identical with that of the study of all media; namely,\nas Keynes wrote, \"“to treat the problem dynamically, analyzing the different\nelements involved, in such a manner as to exhibit the causal process by which\nthe price level is determined, and the method of transition from one position\nof equilibrium to another.”\"\n\nIn a word, money is not a closed system, and does not have its meaning alone.\nAs a translator and amplifier, money has exceptional powers of substituting\none kind of thing for another. Information analysts have come to the\nconclusion that the degree to which one resource can be substituted for\nanother increases when information increases. As we know more, we rely less on\nany one food or fuel or raw material. Clothes and furniture can now be made\nfrom many different materials. Money, which had been for many centuries the\nprincipal transmitter and exchanger of information, is now having its function\nincreasingly transferred to science and automation.\n\nToday, even natural resources have an informational aspect. They exist by\nvirtue of the culture and skill of some community. The reverse, however, is\ntrue also. All media — or extension of man — are natural resources that exist\nby virtue of the shared knowledge and skill of a community. It was awareness\nof this aspect of money that hit Robinson Crusoe very hard when he visited the\nwreck, resulting in the meditation quoted at the beginning of this chapter.\n\nWhen there are goods but no money, some sort of barter — or direct exchange of\none product for another — has to occur. When, however, in nonliterate\nsocieties goods are used in direct exchange, then it is easiest to note their\ntendency to include the function of money. Some work has been done to some\nmaterial, if only in bringing it from a distance. The object, then, stores\nwork and information or technical knowledge to the extent that something has\nbeen done to it. When the one object is exchanged for another, it is already\nassuming the function of money, as translator or reducer of multiple things to\nsome common denominator. The common denominator (or translator) is, however,\nalso a time-saver and expediter. As such, money is time, and it would be hard\nto separate labor-saving from time-saving in this operation.\n\nThere is a mystery about the Phoenicians, who, although they were avid\nmaritime traders, adopted coinage later than the landed Lydians. The reason\nassigned for this delay may not explain the Phoenician problem, but it draws\nsharp attention to a basic fact about money as a medium; namely, that those\nwho traded by caravan required a light and portable medium of payment. This\nneed was less for those who, like the Phoenicians, traded by sea. Portability,\nas a means of expediting and extending the effective distance of action, was\nalso notably illustrated by papyrus. The alphabet was one thing when applied\nto clay or stone, and quite another when set down on light papyrus. The\nresulting leap in speed and space created the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the industrial age the increasingly exact measurement of work revealed\ntime-saving as a major aspect of labor-saving. The media of money and writing\nand clock began to converge into an organic whole again that has brought us as\nclose to the total involvement of man in his work, as of native in a primitive\nsociety, or of artist in his studio.\n\nMoney in one of its features provides a natural transition to number because\nthe money hoard or collection has much in common with the crowd. Moreover, the\npsychological patterns of the crowd and those associated with accumulations of\nwealth are very close. Elias Canetti stresses that the dynamic which is basic\nto crowds is the urge to rapid and unlimited growth. The same power dynamic is\ncharacteristic of large concentrations of wealth or treasure. In fact, the\nmodern unit of treasure in popular use is the _million_. It is a unit\nacceptable to any type of currency. Always associated with the _million_ is\nthe idea that it can be reached by a rapid speculative scramble. In the same\nway, Canetti explains how the ambition to see numbers mounting up was typical\nof Hitler’s speeches.\n\nNot only do crowds of people and piles of money strive toward increase, but\nthey also breed uneasiness about the possibility of disintegration and\ndeflation. This two-way movement of expansion and deflation seems to be the\ncause of the restlessness of crowds and the uneasiness that goes with wealth.\nCanetti spends a good deal of analysis on the psychic effects of the German\ninflation after the First World War. The depreciation of the citizen went\nalong with that of the German mark. There was a loss of face and of worth in\nwhich the personal and monetary units became confused.\n\n\n![Clocks: The Scent of Time](images/title-15.png)\n\nWriting on Communication in Africa, Leonard Doob observes: \"“The turban, the\nsword and nowadays the alarm clock are worn or carried to signify high rank.”\"\nPresumably it will be rather long before the African will watch the clock in\norder to be punctual.\n\nJust as a great revolution in mathematics came when positional, tandem numbers\nwere discovered (302 instead of 32, and so on), so great cultural changes\noccurred in the West when it was found possible to fix time as something that\nhappens between two points. From this application of visual, abstract, and\nuniform units came our Western feeling for time as duration. From our division\nof time into uniform, visualizable units comes our sense of duration and our\nimpatience when we cannot endure the delay between events. Such a sense of\nimpatience, or of time as duration, is unknown among nonliterate cultures.\nJust as _work_ began with the division of labor, duration begins with the\ndivision of time, and especially with those subdivisions by which mechanical\nclocks impose uniform succession on the time sense.\n\nAs a piece of technology, the clock is a machine that produces uniform\nseconds, minutes, and hours on an assembly-line pattern. Processed in this\nuniform way, time is separated from the rhythms of human experience. The\nmechanical clock, in short, helps to create the image of a numerically\nquantified and mechanically powered universe. It was in the world of the\nmedieval monasteries, with their need for a rule and for synchronized order to\nguide communal life, that the clock got started on its modern developments.\nTime measured not by the uniqueness of private experience but by abstract\nuniform units gradually pervades all sense life, much as does the technology\nof writing and printing. Not only work, but also eating and sleeping, came to\naccommodate themselves to the clock rather than to organic needs. As the\npattern of arbitrary and uniform measurement of time extended itself across\nsociety, even clothing began to undergo annual alteration in a way convenient\nfor industry. At that point, of course, mechanical measurement of time as a\nprinciple of applied knowledge joined forces with printing and assembly line\nas means of uniform fragmentation of processes.\n\nThe most integral and involving time sense imaginable is that expressed in the\nChinese and Japanese cultures. Until the coming of the missionaries in the\nseventeenth century, and the introduction of the mechanical clocks, the\nChinese and Japanese had for thousands of years measured time by graduations\nof incense. Not only the hours and days, but the seasons and zodiacal signs\nwere simultaneously indicated by a succession of carefully ordered scents. The\nsense of smell, long considered the root of memory and the unifying basis of\nindividuality, has come to the fore again in the experiments of Wilder\nPenfield. During brain surgery, electric probing of brain tissue revived many\nmemories of the patients. These evocations were dominated and unified by\nunique scents and odors that structured these past experiences. The sense of\nsmell is not only the most subtle and delicate of the human senses; it is,\nalso, the most iconic in that it involves the entire human sensorium more\nfully than any other sense. It is not surprising, therefore, that highly\nliterate societies take steps to reduce or eliminate odors from the\nenvironment. B.O., the unique signature and declaration of human\nindividuality, is a bad word in literate societies. It is far too involving\nfor our habits of detachment and specialist attention. Societies that measured\ntime scents would tend to be so cohesive and so profoundly unified as to\nresist every kind of change.\n\nLewis Mumford has suggested that the clock preceded the printing press in\norder of influence on the mechanization of society. But Mumford takes no\naccount of the phonetic alphabet as the technology that had made possible the\nvisual and uniform fragmentation of time. Mumford, in fact, is unaware of the\nalphabet as the source of Western mechanism, just as he is unaware of\nmechanization as the translation of society from audile-tactile modes into\nvisual values. Our new electric technology is organic and non-mechanical in\ntendency because it extends, not our eyes, but our central nervous systems as\na planetary vesture. In the space-time world of electric technology, the older\nmechanical time begins to feel unacceptable, if only because it is uniform.\n\nModern linguistic studies are structural rather than literary, and owe much to\nthe new possibilities of computers for translation. As soon as an entire\nlanguage is examined as a unified system, strange pockets appear. Looking at\nthe usage scale of English, Martin Joos has wittily designated \"“five clocks\nof style,”\" or five different zones and independent cultural climates. Only\none of these zones is the area of _responsibility_. This is the zone of\nhomogeneity and uniformity that ink-browed Gutenberg rules as his domain. It\nis the style-zone of Standard English pervaded by Central Standard Time, and\nwithin this zone the dwellers, as it were, may show varying degrees of\npunctuality.\n\nEdward T. Hall in The Silent Language discusses how “Time Talks: American\nAccents,” contrasting our time-sense with that of the Hopi Indians. Time for\nthem is not a uniform succession or duration, but a pluralism of many kinds of\nthings co-existing. \"“It is what happens when the corn matures or a sheep\ngrows up.… It is the natural process that takes place while living substance\nacts out its life drama.”\" Therefore, as many kinds of time exist for them as\nthere are kinds of life. This, also, is the kind of time-sense held by the\nmodern physicist and scientist. They no longer try to contain events in time,\nbut think of each thing as making its own time and its own space. Moreover,\nnow that we live electrically in an instantaneous world, space and time\ninterpenetrate each other totally in a space-time world. In the same way, the\npainter, since Cézanne, has recovered the _plastic image_ by which all of the\nsenses coexist in a unified pattern. Each object and each set of objects\nengenders its own unique space by the relations it has among others visually\nor musically. When this awareness recurred in the Western world, it was\ndenounced as the merging of all things in a flux. We now realize that this\nanxiety was a natural literary and visual response to the new nonvisual\ntechnology.\n\nJ. Z. Young, in Doubt and Certainty in Science, explains how electricity is\nnot something that is conveyed by or contained in anything, but is something\nthat occurs when two or more bodies are in special positions. Our language\nderived from phonetic technology cannot cope with this new view of knowledge.\nWe still talk of electric current “flowing,” or we speak of the “discharge” of\nelectric energy like the lineal firing of guns. But quite as much as with the\nesthetic magic of painterly power, \"“electricity is the condition we observe\nwhen there are certain spatial relations between things.”\" The painter learns\nhow to adjust relations among things to release new perception, and the\nchemist and physicist learn how other relations release other kinds of power.\nLess and less, in the electric age, can we find any good reason for imposing\nthe same set of relations on every kind of object or group of objects. Yet in\nthe ancient world the only means of achieving power was getting a thousand\nslaves to act as one man. During the Middle Ages the communal clock extended\nby the bell permitted high coordination of the energies of small communities.\nIn the Renaissance the clock combined with the uniform respectability of the\nnew typography to extend the power of social organization almost to a national\nscale. By the nineteenth century it had provided a technology of cohesion that\nwas inseparable from industry and transport, enabling an entire metropolis to\nact almost as an automaton. Now in the electric age of decentralized power and\ninformation we begin to chafe under the uniformity of clock-time. In this age\nof space-time we seek multiplicity, rather than repeatability, of rhythms.\nThis is the difference between marching soldiers and ballet.\n\nIt is a necessary approach in understanding media and technology to realize\nthat when the spell of the gimmick or an extension of our bodies is new, there\ncomes _narcosis_ or numbing to the newly amplified area. The complaints about\nclocks did not begin until the electric age had made their mechanical sort of\ntime starkly incongruous. In our electric century the mechanical time-kept\ncity looks like an aggregation of somnambulists and zombies, made familiar in\nthe early part of T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land.\n\nOn a planet reduced to village size by new media, cities themselves appear\nquaint and odd, like archaic forms already overlaid with new patterns of\nculture. However, when mechanical clocks had been given great new force and\npracticality by mechanical writing, as printing was at first called, the\nresponse to the new time sense was very ambiguous and even mocking.\nShakespeare’s sonnets are full of the twin themes of immortality of fame\nconferred by the engine of print, as well as the petty futility of daily\nexistence as measured by the clock:\n\n> When I doe count the clock that tels the time,\n>\n> And see the brave day sunck in hidious night …\n>\n> Then of thy beauty do I question make\n>\n> That thou among the wastes of time must goe.\n>\n> (“Sonnet X”)\n\nIn Macbeth, Shakespeare links the twin technologies of print and mechanical\ntime in the familiar soliloquy, to manifest the disintegration of Macbeth’s\nworld:\n\n> Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow\n>\n> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,\n>\n> To the last syllable of recorded time.\n\nTime, as hacked into uniform successive bits by clock and print together,\nbecame a major theme of the Renaissance neurosis, inseparable from the new\ncult of precise measurement in the sciences. In “Sonnet LX,” Shakespeare puts\nmechanical time at the beginning, and the new engine of immortality (print) at\nthe end:\n\n> Like as the waves make towards the pibled shore,\n>\n> So do our minuites hasten to their end,\n>\n> Each changing place with that which goes before,\n>\n> In sequent toil all forwards do contend …\n>\n> And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand\n>\n> Praising thy worth, dispight his cruell hand.\n\nJohn Donne’s poem on “The Sun Rising” exploits the contrast between\naristocratic and bourgeois time. The one trait that most damned the\n_bourgeoisie_ of the nineteenth century was their punctuality, their pedantic\ndevotion to mechanical time and sequential order. As space-time flooded\nthrough the gates of awareness from the new electric technology, all\nmechanical observance became distasteful and even ridiculous. Donne had the\nsame ironic sense of the irrelevance of clock-time, but pretended that in the\nkingdom of love even the great cosmic cycles of time were also petty aspects\nof the clock:\n\n> Busy old fool, unruly Sun,\n>\n> Why dost thou thus\n>\n> Through windows, and through curtains call on us?\n>\n> Must to thy motions lovers’ seasons run?\n>\n> Saucy, pedantic wretch, go chide\n>\n> Late school-boys, and sour prentices,\n>\n> Go tell Court-huntsmen, that the King will ride,\n>\n> Call country ants to harvest offices,\n>\n> Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,\n>\n> Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.\n\nMuch of Donne’s twentieth-century vogue was due to his challenging the\nauthority of the new Gutenberg age to invest him with the stigmata of uniform\nrepeatable typography and with the motives of precise visual measurement. In\nlike manner, Andrew Marvell’s “To his Coy Mistress” was full of contempt for\nthe new spirit of measurement and calculation of time and virtue:\n\n> Had we but world enough and time,\n>\n> This coyness, lady, were no crime.\n>\n> We would sit down and think which way\n>\n> To walk, and pass our long love’s day …\n>\n> An hundred years should go to praise\n>\n> Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;\n>\n> Two hundred to adore each breast,\n>\n> But thirty thousand to the rest;\n>\n> An age at least to every part,\n>\n> And the last age should show your heart,\n>\n> For lady, you deserve this state,\n>\n> Nor would I love at lower rate.\n\nMarvell merged the rates of exchange with the rates of praise suited to the\nconventional and fashionably fragmented outlook of his inamorata. For her box-\noffice approach to reality, he substituted another time-structure, and a\ndifferent model of perception. It is not unlike Hamlet’s \"“Look on this\npicture and on that.”\" Instead of a quiet bourgeois translation of the\nmedieval love code into the language of the new middle-class tradesman, why\nnot a Byronic caper to the farther shores of ideal love?\n\n> But at my back I always hear\n>\n> Time’s winged chariot hurrying near;\n>\n> And yonder all before us lie\n>\n> Deserts of vast eternity.\n\nHere is the new lineal perspective that had come to painting with Gutenberg,\nbut that had not entered the verbal universe until Milton’s Paradise Lost.\nEven written language had resisted for two centuries the abstract visual order\nof lineal succession and vanishing point. The next age after Marvell, however,\ntook to landscape poetry and the subordination of language to special visual\neffects.\n\nBut Marvell concluded his reverse strategy for the conquest of bourgeois\nclock-time with the observation:\n\n> Thus, though we cannot make our sun\n>\n> Stand still, yet we will make him run.\n\nHe proposed that his beloved and he should transform themselves into a\ncannonball and fire themselves at the sun to make it run. Time can be\ndefeated, as it were, by reversal of its characteristics if only it be speeded\nup enough. Experience of this fact awaited the electronic age, which found\nthat instant speeds abolish time and space, and return man to an integral and\nprimitive awareness.\n\nToday not only clock-time, but the wheel itself, is obsolescent and is\nretracting into animal form under the impulse of greater and greater speeds.\nIn the poem above, Andrew Marvell’s intuition that clock-time could be\ndefeated by speed was quite sound. At present the mechanical begins to yield\nto organic unity under conditions of electric speeds. Man now can look back at\ntwo or three thousand years of varying degrees of mechanization with full\nawareness of the mechanical as an interlude between two great organic periods\nof culture. In 1911 the Italian sculptor Boccioni said, \"“We are primitives of\nan unknown culture.”\" Half a century later we know a bit more about the new\nculture of the electronic age, and that knowledge has lifted the mystery\nsurrounding the machine.\n\nAs contrasted with the mere tool, the machine is an extension or outering of a\nprocess. The tool extends the fist, the nails, the teeth, the arm. The wheel\nextends the feet in rotation or sequential movement. Printing, the first\ncomplete mechanization of a handicraft, breaks up the movement of the hand\ninto a series of discrete steps that are as repeatable as the wheel is rotary.\nFrom this analytic sequence came the assembly-line principle, but the assembly\nline is now obsolete in the electric age because synchronization is no longer\nsequential. By electric tapes, synchronization of any number of different acts\ncan be simultaneous. Thus the mechanical principle of analysis in series has\ncome to an end. Even the wheel has now come to an end in principle, although\nthe mechanical stratum of our culture carries it still as part of an\naccumulated momentum, an archaic configuration.\n\nThe modern clock, mechanical in principle, embodied the wheel. The clock has\nceased to have its older meanings and functions. Plurality-of-times succeeds\nuniformity-of-time. Today it is only too easy to have dinner in New York and\nindigestion in Paris. Travelers also have the daily experience of being at one\nhour in a culture that is still 3000 b.c., and at the next hour in a culture\nthat is 1900 a.d. Most of North American life is, in its externals, conducted\non nineteenth-century lines. Our inner experience, increasingly at variance\nwith these mechanical patterns, is electric, inclusive, and mythic in mode.\nThe mythic or iconic mode of awareness substitutes the multi-faceted for\npoint-of-view.\n\nHistorians agree on the basic role of the clock in monastic life for the\nsynchronization of human tasks. The acceptance of such fragmenting of life\ninto minutes and hours was unthinkable, save in highly literate communities.\nReadiness to submit the human organism to the alien mode of mechanical time\nwas as dependent upon literacy in the first Christian centuries as it is\ntoday. For the clock to dominate, there has to be the prior acceptance of the\nvisual stress that is inseparable from phonetic literacy. Literacy is itself\nan abstract asceticism that prepares the way for endless patterns of privation\nin the human community. With universal literacy, time can take on the\ncharacter of an enclosed or pictorial space that can be divided and\nsubdivided. It can be filled in. “My schedule is filled up.” It can be kept\nfree: “I have a free week next month.” And as Sebastian de Grazia has shown in\nOf Time, Work and Leisure, all the free time in the world is not leisure,\nbecause leisure accepts neither the division of labor that constitutes “work,”\nnor the divisions of time that create “full time” and “free time.” Leisure\nexcludes time as a container. Once time is mechanically or visually enclosed,\ndivided, and filled, it is possible to use it more and more efficiently. Time\ncan be transformed into a labor-saving machine, as Parkinson reveals in his\nfamous “Parkinson’s Law.”\n\nThe student of the history of the clock will find that a totally new principle\nentered with the invention of the mechanical clock. The earliest mechanical\nclocks had retained the old principle of the continuous action of the driving\nforce, such as was used in the water clock and in the water wheel. It was\nabout 1300 a.d. that the step was taken of momentarily interrupting rotary\nmovement by a crown rod and balance wheel. This function was called\n“escapement” and was the means of literally translating the continuous force\nof the wheel into the visual principle of uniform but segmented succession.\nEscapement introduced the reciprocal reversing action of the hands in rotating\na spindle forward and backward. The meeting in the mechanical clock of this\nancient extension of hand movement with the forward rotary motion of the wheel\nwas, in effect, the translation of hands into feet, and feet into hands.\nPerhaps no more difficult technological extension of interinvolved bodily\nappendages could be found. The source of the energy of the clock was thus\nseparated from the hands, or the source of information, by technological\ntranslation. Escapement as a translation of one kind of wheel space into\nuniform and visual space is thus a direct anticipation of the infinitesimal\ncalculus that translates any kind of space or movement into a uniform,\ncontinuous, and visual space.\n\nParkinson, sitting on the fence between the mechanical and the electric uses\nof work and time, is able to provide us with real entertainment by simply\nsquinting, now with one eye, now with the other, at the time and work picture.\nCultures like ours, poised at the point of transformation, engender both\ntragic and comic awareness in great abundance. It is the maximal interplay of\ndiverse forms of perception and experience that makes great the cultures of\nthe fifth century b.c., the sixteenth century, and the twentieth century. But\nfew people have enjoyed living in these intense periods when all that ensures\nfamiliarity and security dissolves and is reconfigured in a few decades.\n\nIt was not the clock, but literacy reinforced by the clock, that created\nabstract time and led men to eat, not when they were hungry, but when it was “\n_time_ to eat.” Lewis Mumford makes a telling observation when he says that\nthe abstract mechanical time-sense of the Renaissance enabled men to live in\nthe classical past, and to tear themselves out of their own present. Here\nagain, it was the printing press that made possible the recreation of the\nclassic past by mass production of its literature and texts. The establishment\nof a mechanical and abstract time _pattern_ soon extends itself to periodic\nalteration of clothing styles, much in the same way that mass production\nextends itself to periodic publication of newspapers and magazines. Today we\ntake for granted that the job of Vogue magazine is to alter the dress styles\nas part of the process of its being printed at all. When a thing is current,\nit creates currency; fashion creates wealth by moving textiles and making them\never more current. This process we have seen at work in the section on\n“Money.” Clocks are mechanical media that transform tasks and create new work\nand wealth by accelerating the pace of human association. By coordinating and\naccelerating human meetings and goings-on, clocks increase the sheer quantity\nof human exchange.\n\nIt is not really incongruous, therefore, when Mumford associates \"“the clock\nand the printing press and the blast furnace”\" as the giant innovations of the\nRenaissance. The clock, as much as the blast furnace, speeded the melting of\nmaterials and the rise of smooth conformity in the contours of social life.\nLong before the industrial revolution of the later eighteenth century, people\ncomplained that society had become a “prose machine” that whisked them through\nlife at a dizzy pace.\n\nThe clock dragged man out of the world of seasonal rhythms and recurrence, as\neffectively as the alphabet had released him from the magical resonance of the\nspoken word and the tribal trap. This dual translation of the individual out\nof the grip of Nature and out of the clutch of the tribe was not without its\nown penalties. But the return to Nature and the return to the tribe are, under\nelectric conditions, fatally simple. We need beware of those who announce\nprograms for restoring man to the original state and language of the race.\nThese crusaders have never examined the role of media and technology in\ntossing man about from dimension to dimension. They are like the\nsomnambulistic African chief with the alarm clock strapped to his back.\n\nMircea Eliade, professor of comparative religion, is unaware, in The Sacred\nand the Profane, that a “sacred” universe in his sense is one dominated by the\nspoken word and by auditory media. A “profane” universe, on the other hand, is\none dominated by the visual sense. The clock and the alphabet, by hacking the\nuniverse into visual segments, ended the music of interrelation. The visual\ndesacralizes the universe and produces the “nonreligious man of modern\nsocieties.”\n\nHistorically, however, Eliade is useful in recounting how, before the age of\nthe clock and the time-kept city, there was for tribal man a cosmic clock and\na sacred time of the cosmogony itself. When tribal man wanted to build a city\nor a house, or cure an illness, he wound up the cosmic clock by an elaborate\nritual reenactment or recitation of the original process of creation. Eliade\nmentions that in Fiji “the ceremony for installing a new ruler is called\n‘creation of the world.’ ” The same drama is enacted to help the growth of\ncrops. Whereas modern man feels obligated to be punctual and conservative of\ntime, tribal man bore the responsibility for keeping the cosmic clock supplied\nwith energy. But electric or ecological man (man of the total field) can be\nexpected to surpass the old tribal cosmic concern with the Africa within.\n\nPrimitive man lived in a much more tyrannical cosmic machine than Western\nliterate man has ever invented. The world of the ear is more embracing and\ninclusive than that of the eye can ever be. The ear is hypersensitive. The eye\nis cool and detached. The ear turns man over to universal panic while the eye,\nextended by literacy and mechanical time, leaves some gaps and some islands\nfree from the unremitting acoustic pressure and reverberation.\n\n\n![The Print: How to Dig It](images/title-16.png)\n\nThe art of making pictorial statements in a precise and repeatable form is one\nthat we have long taken for granted in the West. But it is usually forgotten\nthat without prints and blueprints, without maps and geometry, the world of\nmodern sciences and technologies would hardly exist.\n\nIn the time of Ferdinand and Isabella and other maritime monarchs, maps were\ntop-secret, like new electronic discoveries today. When the captains returned\nfrom their voyages, every effort was made by the officers of the crown to\nobtain both originals and copies of the maps made during the voyage. The\nresult was a lucrative black-market trade, and secret maps were widely sold.\nThe sort of maps in question had nothing in common with those of later design,\nbeing in fact more like diaries of different adventures and experiences. For\nthe later perception of space as uniform and continuous was unknown to the\nmedieval cartographer, whose efforts resembled modern nonobjective art. The\nshock of the new Renaissance space is still felt by natives who encounter it\ntoday for the first time. Prince Modupe tells in his autobiography, I Was a\nSavage, how he had learned to read maps at school, and how he had taken back\nhome to his village a map of a river his father had traveled for years as a\ntrader.\n\n> … my father thought the whole idea was absurd. He refused to identify the\n> stream he had crossed at Bomako, where it is no deeper, he said, than a man\n> is high, with the great widespread waters of the vast Niger delta. Distances\n> as measured in miles had no meaning for him … Maps are liars, he told me\n> briefly. From his tone of voice I could tell that I had offended him in some\n> way not known to me at the time. The things that hurt one do not show on a\n> map. The truth of a place is in the joy and the hurt that come from it. I\n> had best not put my trust in anything as inadequate as a map, he counseled …\n> I understand now, although I did not at the time, that my airy and easy\n> sweep of map-traced staggering distances belittled the journeys he had\n> measured on tired feet. With my big map-talk, I had effaced the magnitude of\n> his cargo-laden, heat-weighted treks.\n\nAll the words in the world cannot describe an object like a bucket, although\nit is possible to tell in a few words how to _make_ a bucket. This inadequacy\nof words to convey visual information about objects was an effectual block to\nthe development of the Greek and Roman sciences. Pliny the Elder reported the\ninability of the Greek and Latin botanists to devise a means of transmitting\ninformation about plants and flowers:\n\n> Hence it is that other writers have confined themselves to a verbal\n> description of the plants; indeed some of them have not so much as described\n> them even, but have contented themselves for the most part with a bare\n> recital of their names …\n\nWe are confronted here once more with that basic function of media—to store\nand to expedite information. Plainly, to store is to expedite, since what is\nstored is also more accessible than what has to be gathered. The fact that\nvisual information about flowers and plants cannot be stored verbally also\npoints to the fact that science in the Western world has long been dependent\non the visual factor. Nor is this surprising in a literate culture based on\nthe technology of the alphabet, one that reduces even spoken language to a\nvisual mode. As electricity has created multiple non-visual means of storing\nand retrieving information, not only culture but science also has shifted its\nentire base and character. For the educator, as well as the philosopher, exact\nknowledge of what this shift means for learning and the mental process is not\nnecessary.\n\nWell before Gutenberg’s development of printing from movable types, a great\ndeal of printing on paper by woodcut had been done. Perhaps the most popular\nform of this kind of block printing of text and image had been in the form of\nthe _Biblia Pauperum_ , or Bibles of the Poor. Printers in this woodcut sense\npreceded typographic printers, though by just how long a period it is not easy\nto establish, because these cheap and popular prints, despised by the learned,\nwere not preserved any more than are the comic books of today. The great law\nof bibliography comes into play in this matter of the printing that precedes\nGutenberg: \"“The more there were, the fewer there are.”\" It applies to many\nitems besides printed matter—to the postage stamp and to the early forms of\nradio receiving sets.\n\nMedieval and Renaissance man experienced little of the separation and\nspecialty among the arts that developed later. The manuscript and the earlier\nprinted books were read aloud, and poetry was sung or intoned. Oratory, music,\nliterature, and drawing were closely related. Above all, the world of the\nilluminated manuscript was one in which lettering itself was given plastic\nstress to an almost sculptural degree. In a study of the art of Andrea\nMantegna, the illuminator of manuscripts, Millard Meiss mentions that, amidst\nthe flowery and leafy margins of the page, Mantegna’s letters \"“rise like\nmonuments, stony, stable and finely cut.… Palpably soled and weighty, they\nstand boldly before the colored ground, upon which they often throw a\nshadow.…”\"\n\nThe same feeling for the letters of the alphabet as engraved icons has\nreturned in our own day in the graphic arts and in advertising display.\nPerhaps the reader will have encountered the sense of this coming change in\nRimbaud’s sonnet on the vowels, or in some of Braque’s paintings. But ordinary\nnewspaper headline style tends to push letters toward the iconic form, a form\nthat is very near to auditory resonance, as it is also to tactile and\nsculptural quality.\n\nPerhaps the supreme quality of the print is one that is lost on us, since it\nhas so casual and obvious an existence. It is simply that it is a pictorial\nstatement that can be repeated precisely and indefinitely—at least as long as\nthe printing surface lasts. Repeatability is the core of the mechanical\nprinciple that has dominated our world, especially since the Gutenberg\ntechnology. The message of the print and of typography is primarily that of\nrepeatability. With typography, the principle of movable type introduced the\nmeans of mechanizing any handicraft by the process of segmenting and\nfragmenting an integral action. What had begun with the alphabet as a\nseparation of the multiple gestures and sights and sounds in the spoken word,\nreached a new level of intensity, first with the woodcut and then with\ntypography. The alphabet left the visual component as supreme in the word,\nreducing all other sensuous facts of the spoken word to this form. This helps\nto explain why the woodcut, and even the photograph, were so eagerly welcomed\nin a literate world. These forms provide a world of inclusive gesture and\ndramatic posture that necessarily is omitted in the written word.\n\nThe print was eagerly seized upon as a means of imparting information, as well\nas an incentive to piety and meditation. In 1472 the Art of War by Volturius\nwas printed at Verona, with many woodcuts to explain the machinery of war. But\nthe uses of the woodcut as an aid to contemplation in Books of Hours, Emblems,\nand Shepherds’ Calendars continued for two hundred years on a large scale.\n\nIt is relevant to consider that the old prints and woodcuts, like the modern\ncomic strip and comic book, provide very little data about any particular\nmoment in time, or aspect in space, of an object. The viewer, or reader, is\ncompelled to participate in completing and interpreting the few hints provided\nby the bounding lines. Not unlike the character of the woodcut and the cartoon\nis the TV image, with its very low degree of data about objects, and the\nresulting high degree of participation by the viewer in order to complete what\nis only hinted at in the mosaic mesh of dots. Since the advent of TV, the\ncomic book has gone into a decline.\n\nIt is, perhaps, obvious enough that if a cool medium involves the viewer a\ngreat deal, a hot medium will not. It may contradict popular ideas to say that\ntypography as a hot medium involves the reader much less than did manuscript,\nor to point out that the comic book and TV as cool media involve the user, as\nmaker and participant, a great deal.\n\nAfter the exhaustion of the Graeco-Roman pools of slave labor, the West had to\ntechnologize more intensively than the ancient world had done. In the same way\nthe American farmer, confronted with new tasks and opportunities, and at the\nsame time with a great shortage of human assistance, was goaded into a frenzy\nof creation of labor-saving devices. It would seem that the logic of success\nin this matter is the ultimate retirement of the work force from the scene of\ntoil. In a word, automation. If this, however, has been the motive behind all\nof our human technologies, it does not follow that we are prepared to accept\nthe consequences. It helps to get one’s bearings to see the process at work in\nremote times when work meant specialist servitude, and leisure alone meant a\nlife of human dignity and involvement of the whole man.\n\nThe print in its clumsy woodcut-phase reveals a major aspect of language;\nnamely, that words cannot bear sharp definition in daily use. When Descartes\nsurveyed the philosophical scene at the beginning of the seventeenth century,\nhe was appalled at the confusion of tongues and began to strive toward a\nreduction of philosophy to precise mathematical form. This striving for an\nirrelevant precision served only to exclude from philosophy most of the\nquestions of philosophy; and that great kingdom of philosophy was soon\nparceled out into the wide range of uncommunicating sciences and specialties\nwe know today. Intensity of stress on visual blueprinting and precision is an\nexplosive force that fragments the world of power and knowledge alike. The\nincreasing precision and quantity of visual information transformed the print\ninto a three-dimensional world of perspective and fixed point of view.\nHieronymus Bosch, by means of paintings that interfused medieval forms in\nRenaissance space, told what it felt like to live straddled between the two\nworlds of the old and the new during this revolution. Simultaneously, Bosch\nprovided the older kind of plastic, tactile image but placed it in the intense\nnew visual perspective. He gave at once the older medieval idea of unique,\ndiscontinuous space, superimposed on the new idea of uniform, connected space.\nThis he did with earnest nightmare intensity.\n\nLewis Carroll took the nineteenth century into a dream world that was as\nstartling as that of Bosch, but built on reverse principles. Alice in\nWonderland offers as norm that continuous time and space that had created\nconsternation in the Renaissance. Pervading this uniform Euclidean world of\nfamiliar space-and-time, Carroll drove a fantasia of discontinuous space-and-\ntime that anticipated Kafka, Joyce, and Eliot. Carroll, the mathematical\ncontemporary of Clerk Maxwell, was quite _avant-garde_ enough to know about\nthe non-Euclidean geometries coming into vogue in his time. He gave the\nconfident Victorians a playful foretaste of Einsteinian time-and-space in\nAlice in Wonderland. Bosch had provided his era a foretaste of the new\ncontinuous time-and-space of uniform perspective. Bosch looked ahead to the\nmodern world with horror, as Shakespeare did in King Lear, and as Pope did in\nThe Dunciad. But Lewis Carroll greeted the electronic age of space-time with a\ncheer.\n\nNigerians studying at American universities are sometimes asked to identify\nspatial relations. Confronted with objects in sunshine, they are often unable\nto indicate in which direction shadows will fall, for this involves casting\ninto three-dimensional perspective. Thus sun, objects, and observer are\nexperienced separately and regarded as independent of one another. For\nmedieval man, as for the native, space was not homogeneous and did not\n_contain_ objects. Each thing made its own space, as it still does for the\nnative (and equally for the modern physicist). Of course this does not mean\nthat native artists do not relate things. They often contrive the most\ncomplicated, sophisticated configurations. Neither artist nor observer has the\nslightest trouble recognizing and interpreting the pattern, but only when it\nis a traditional one. If you begin to modify it, or translate it into another\nmedium (three dimensions, for instance), the native fails to recognize it.\n\nAn anthropological film showed a Melanesian carver cutting out a decorated\ndrum with such skill, coordination, and ease that the audience several times\nbroke into applause — it became a song, a ballet. But when the anthropologist\nasked the tribe to build crates to ship these carvings in, they struggled\nunsuccessfully for three days to make two planks intersect at a 90-degree\nangle, then gave up in frustration. They couldn’t crate what they had created.\n\nIn the low definition world of the medieval woodcut, each object created its\nown space, and there was no rational connected space into which it must fit.\nAs the retinal impression is intensified, objects cease to cohere in a space\nof their own making, and, instead, become “contained” in a uniform,\ncontinuous, and “rational” space. Relativity theory in 1905 announced the\ndissolution of uniform Newtonian space as an illusion or fiction, however\nuseful. Einstein pronounced the doom of continuous or “rational” space, and\nthe way was made clear for Picasso and the Marx brothers and MAD.\n\n\n![Comics: MAD Vestibule to TV](images/title-17.png)\n\nIt was thanks to the print that Dickens became a comic writer. He began as a\nprovider of copy for a popular cartoonist. To consider the comics here, after\n“The Print,” is to fix attention upon the persistent print-like, and even\ncrude woodcut, characteristics of our twentieth-century comics. It is by no\nmeans easy to perceive how the same qualities of print and woodcut could\nreappear in the mosaic mesh of the TV image. TV is so difficult a subject for\nliterary people that it has to be approached obliquely. From the three million\ndots per second on TV, the viewer is able to accept, in an iconic grasp, only\na few dozen, seventy or so, from which to shape an image. The image thus made\nis as crude as that of the comics. It is for this reason that the print and\nthe comics provide a useful approach to understanding the TV image, for they\noffer very little visual information or connected detail. Painters and\nsculptors, however, can easily understand TV, because they sense how very much\ntactile involvement is needed for the appreciation of plastic art.\n\nThe structural qualities of the print and woodcut obtain, also, in the\ncartoon, all of which share a participational and do-it-yourself character\nthat pervades a wide variety of media experiences today. The print is clue to\nthe comic cartoon, just as the cartoon is clue to understanding the TV image.\n\nMany a wrinkled teenager recalls his fascination with that pride of the\ncomics, the “Yellow Kid” of Richard F. Outcault. On first appearance, it was\ncalled “Hogan’s Alley” in the New York Sunday World. It featured a variety of\nscenes of kids from the tenements, Maggie and Jiggs as children, as it were.\nThis feature sold many papers in 1898 and thereafter. Hearst soon bought it,\nand began large-scale comic supplements. Comics (as already explained in the\nchapter on The Print), being low in definition, are a highly participational\nform of expression, perfectly adapted to the mosaic form of the newspaper.\nThey provide, also, a sense of continuity from one day to the next. The\nindividual news item is very low in information, and requires completion or\nfill-in by the reader, exactly as does the TV image, or the wirephoto. That is\nthe reason why TV hit the comic-book world so hard. It was a real rival,\nrather than a complement. But TV hit the pictorial ad world even harder,\ndislodging the sharp and glossy, in favor of the shaggy, the sculptural, and\nthe tactual. Hence the sudden eminence of MAD magazine which offers, merely, a\nludicrous and cool replay of the forms of the hot media of photo, radio, and\nfilm. MAD is the old print and woodcut image that recurs in various media\ntoday. Its type of configuration will come to shape all of the acceptable TV\nofferings.\n\nThe biggest casualty of the TV impact was Al Capp’s “Li’l Abner.” For eighteen\nyears Al Capp had kept Li’l Abner on the verge of matrimony. The sophisticated\nformula used with his characters was the reverse of that employed by the\nFrench novelist Stendhal, who said, \"“I simply involve my people in the\nconsequences of their own stupidity and then give them brains so they can\nsuffer.”\" Al Capp, in effect, said, \"“I simply involve my people in the\nconsequences of their own stupidity and then _take away_ their brains so that\nthey can do nothing about it.”\" Their inability to help themselves created a\nsort of parody of all the other suspense comics. Al Capp pushed suspense into\nabsurdity. But readers have long enjoyed the fact that the Dogpatch\npredicament of helpless ineptitude was a paradigm of the human situation, in\ngeneral.\n\nWith the arrival of TV and its iconic mosaic image, the everyday life\nsituations began to seem very square, indeed. Al Capp suddenly found that his\nkind of distortion no longer worked. He felt that Americans had lost their\npower to laugh at themselves. He was wrong. TV simply involved everybody in\neverybody more deeply than before. This cool medium, with its mandate of\nparticipation in depth, required Capp to refocus the Li’l Abner image. His\nconfusion and dismay were a perfect match for the feelings of those in every\nmajor American enterprise. From Life to General Motors, and from the classroom\nto the Executive Suite, a refocusing of aims and images to permit ever more\naudience involvement and participation has been inevitable. Capp said: \"“But\nnow America has changed. The humorist feels the change more, perhaps, than\nanyone. Now there are things about America we can’t kid.”\"\n\nDepth involvement encourages everyone to take himself much more seriously than\nbefore. As TV cooled off the American audience, giving it new preferences and\nnew orientation of sight and sound and touch and taste, Al Capp’s wonderful\nbrew also had to be toned down. There was no more need to kid Dick Tracy or\nthe suspense routines. As MAD magazine discovered, the new audience found the\nscenes and themes of ordinary life as funny as anything in remote Dogpatch.\nMAD magazine simply transferred the world of ads into the world of the comic\nbook, and it did this just when the TV image was beginning to eliminate the\ncomic book by direct rivalry. At the same time, the TV image rendered the\nsharp and clear photographic image as blur and blear. TV cooled off the ad\naudience until the continuing vehemence of the ads and entertainment suited\nthe program of the MAD magazine world very well. TV, in fact, turned the\nprevious hot media of photo, film, and radio into a comic-strip world by\nsimply featuring them as overheated packages. Today the ten-year-old clutches\nhis or her MAD (“Build up your Ego with MAD”) in the same way that the Russian\nbeatnik treasures an old Presley tape obtained from a G.I. broadcast. If the\n“Voice of America” suddenly switched to jazz, the Kremlin would have reason to\ncrumble. It would be almost as effective as if the Russian citizens had copies\nof Sears Roebuck catalogues to goggle at, instead of our dreary propaganda for\nthe American way of life.\n\nPicasso has long been a fan of American comics. The highbrow, from Joyce to\nPicasso, has long been devoted to American popular art because he finds in it\nan authentic imaginative reaction to official action. Genteel art, on the\nother hand, tends merely to evade and disapprove of the blatant modes of\naction in a powerful high definition, or “square,” society. Genteel art is a\nkind of repeat of the specialized acrobatic feats of an industrialized world.\nPopular art is the clown reminding us of all the life and faculty that we have\nomitted from our daily routines. He ventures to perform the specialized\nroutines of the society, acting as integral man. But integral man is quite\ninept in a specialist situation. This, at least, is one way to get at the art\nof the comics, and the art of the clown.\n\nToday our ten-year-olds, in voting for MAD, are telling us in their own way\nthat the TV image has ended the consumer phase of American culture. They are\nnow telling us what the eighteen-year-old beatniks were first trying to say\nten years ago. The pictorial consumer age is dead. The iconic age is upon us.\nWe now toss to the Europeans the package that concerned us from 1922 to 1952.\nThey, in turn, enter their first consumer age of standardized goods. We move\ninto our first depth-age of art-and-producer orientation. America is\nEuropeanizing on as extensive a pattern as Europe is Americanizing.\n\nWhere does this leave the older popular comics? What about “Blondie” and\n“Bringing Up Father”? Theirs was a pastoral world of primal innocence from\nwhich young America has clearly graduated. There was still adolescence in\nthose days, and there were still remote ideals and private dreams, and\nvisualizable goals, rather than vigorous and ever-present corporate postures\nfor group participation.\n\nThe chapter on The Print indicated how the cartoon is a do-it-yourself form of\nexperience that has developed an ever more vigorous life as the electric age\nadvanced. Thus, all electric appliances, far from being labor-saving devices,\nare new forms of work, decentralized and made available to everybody. Such is,\nalso, the world of the telephone and the TV image that demands so much more of\nits users than does radio or movie. As a simple consequence of this\nparticipational and do-it-yourself aspect of the electric technology, every\nkind of entertainment in the TV age favors the same kind of personal\ninvolvement. Hence the paradox that, in the TV age, Johnny can’t read because\nreading, as customarily taught, is too superficial and consumerlike an\nactivity. Therefore the highbrow paperback, because of its depth character,\nmay appeal to youngsters who spurn ordinary narrative offerings. Teachers\ntoday frequently find that students who can’t read a page of history are\nbecoming experts in code and linguistic analysis. The problem, therefore, is\nnot that Johnny can’t read, but that, in an age of depth involvement, Johnny\ncan’t visualize distant goals.\n\nThe first comic books appeared in 1935. Not having anything connected or\nliterary about them, and being as difficult to decipher as the Book of Kells,\nthey caught on with the young. The elders of the tribe, who had never noticed\nthat the ordinary newspaper was as frantic as a surrealist art exhibition,\ncould hardly be expected to notice that the comic books were as exotic as\neighth-century illuminations. So, having noticed nothing about the _form_ ,\nthey could discern nothing of the _contents_ , either. The mayhem and violence\nwere all they noted. Therefore, with naïve literary logic, they waited for\nviolence to flood the world. Or, alternatively, they attributed existing crime\nto the comics. The dimmest-witted convict learned to moan, \"“It wuz comic\nbooks done this to me.”\"\n\nMeantime, the violence of an industrial and mechanical environment had to be\nlived and given meaning and motive in the nerves and viscera of the young. To\nlive and experience anything is to translate its direct impact into many\nindirect forms of awareness. We provided the young with a shrill and raucous\nasphalt jungle, beside which any tropical animal jungle was as quiet and tame\nas a rabbit hutch. We called this normal. We paid people to keep it at the\nhighest pitch of intensity because it paid well. When the entertainment\nindustries tried to provide a reasonable facsimile of the ordinary city\nvehemence, eyebrows were raised.\n\nIt was Al Capp who discovered that until TV, at least, any degree of Scragg\nmayhem or Phogbound morality was accepted as funny. _He_ didn’t think it was\nfunny. He put in his strip just exactly what he saw around him. But our\ntrained incapacity to relate one situation to another enabled his sardonic\nrealism to be mistaken for humor. The more he showed the capacity of people to\ninvolve themselves in hideous difficulties, along with their entire inability\nto turn a hand to help themselves, the more they giggled. \"“Satire,”\" said\nSwift, \"“is a glass in which we see every countenance but our own.”\"\n\nThe comic strip and the ad, then, both belong to the world of games, to the\nworld of models and extensions of situations elsewhere. MAD magazine, world of\nthe woodcut, the print, and the cartoon, brought them together with other\ngames and models from the world of entertainment. MAD is a kind of newspaper\nmosaic of the ad as entertainment, and entertainment as a form of madness.\nAbove all, it is a print- and woodcut-form of expression and experience whose\nsudden appeal is a sure index of deep changes in our culture. Our need now is\nto understand the formal character of print, comic and cartoon, both as\nchallenging and changing the consumer-culture of film, photo, and press. There\nis no single approach to this task, and no single observation or idea that can\nsolve so complex a problem in changing human perception.\n\n\n![The Printed Word: Architect of Nationalism](images/title-18.png)\n\n\"“You may perceive, Madam,”\" said Dr. Johnson with a pugilistic smile, \"“that\nI am well-bred to a degree of needless scrupulosity.”\" Whatever the degree of\nconformity the Doctor had achieved with the new stress of his time on white-\nshirted tidiness, he was quite aware of the growing social demand for visual\npresentability.\n\nPrinting from movable types was the first mechanization of a complex\nhandicraft, and became the archetype of all subsequent mechanization. From\nRabelais and More to Mill and Morris, the typographic explosion extended the\nminds and voices of men to reconstitute the human dialogue on a world scale\nthat has bridged the ages. For if seen merely as a store of information, or as\na new means of speedy retrieval of knowledge, typography ended parochialism\nand tribalism, psychically and socially, both in space and in time. Indeed the\nfirst two centuries of printing from movable types were motivated much more by\nthe desire to see ancient and medieval books than by the need to read and\nwrite new ones. Until 1700 much more than 50 per cent of all printed books\nwere ancient or medieval. Not only antiquity but also the Middle Ages were\ngiven to the first reading public of the printed word. And the medieval texts\nwere by far the most popular.\n\nLike any other extension of man, typography had psychic and social\nconsequences that suddenly shifted previous boundaries and patterns of\nculture. In bringing the ancient and medieval worlds into fusion—or, as some\nwould say, confusion — the printed book created a third world, the modern\nworld, which now encounters a new electric technology or a new extension of\nman. Electric means of moving of information are altering our typographic\nculture as sharply as print modified medieval manuscript and scholastic\nculture.\n\nBeatrice Warde has recently described in Alphabet an electric display of\nletters painted by light. It was a Norman McLaren movie advertisement of which\nshe asks:\n\n> Do you wonder that I was late for the theatre that night, when I tell you\n> that I saw two club-footed Egyptian A’s … walking off arm-in-arm with the\n> unmistakable swagger of a music-hall comedy-team? I saw base-serifs pulled\n> together as if by ballet shoes, so that the letters tripped off literally\n> _sur les pointes_ … after forty centuries of the _necessarily static_\n> Alphabet, I saw what its members could do in the fourth dimension of Time,\n> “flux,” movement. You may well say that I was electrified.\n\nNothing could be farther from typographic culture with its \"“place for\neverything and everything in its place.”\"\n\nMrs. Warde has spent her life in the study of typography and she shows sure\ntact in her startled response to letters that are not printed by types but\npainted by light. It may be that the explosion that began with phonetic\nletters (the “dragon’s teeth” sowed by King Cadmus) will reverse into\n“implosion” under the impulse of the instant speed of electricity. The\nalphabet (and its extension into typography) made possible the spread of the\npower that is knowledge, and shattered the bonds of tribal man, thus exploding\nhim into an agglomeration of individuals. Electric writing and speed pour upon\nhim, instantaneously and continuously, the concerns of all other men. He\nbecomes tribal once more. The human family becomes one tribe again.\n\nAny student of the social history of the printed book is likely to be puzzled\nby the lack of understanding of the psychic and social effects of printing. In\nfive centuries explicit comment and awareness of the effects of print on human\nsensibility are very scarce. But the same observation can be made about all\nthe extensions of man, whether it be clothing or the computer. An extension\nappears to be an amplification of an organ, a sense or a function, that\ninspires the central nervous system to a self-protective gesture of numbing of\nthe extended area, at least so far as direct inspection and awareness are\nconcerned. Indirect comment on the effects of the printed book is available in\nabundance in the work of Rabelais, Cervantes, Montaigne, Swift, Pope, and\nJoyce. They used typography to create new art forms.\n\nPsychically the printed book, an extension of the visual faculty, intensified\nperspective and the fixed point of view. Associated with the visual stress on\npoint of view and the vanishing point that provides the illusion of\nperspective there comes another illusion that space is visual, uniform and\ncontinuous. The linearity, precision, and uniformity of the arrangement of\nmovable types are inseparable from these great cultural forms and innovations\nof Renaissance experience. The new intensity of visual stress and private\npoint of view in the first century of printing were united to the means of\nself-expression made possible by the typographic extension of man.\n\nSocially, the typographic extension of man brought in nationalism,\nindustrialism, mass markets, and universal literacy and education. For print\npresented an image of repeatable precision that inspired totally new forms of\nextending social energies. Print released great psychic and social energies in\nthe Renaissance, as today in Japan or Russia, by breaking the individual out\nof the traditional group while providing a model of how to add individual to\nindividual in massive agglomeration of power. The same spirit of private\nenterprise that emboldened authors and artists to cultivate self-expression\nled other men to create giant corporations, both military and commercial.\n\nPerhaps the most significant of the gifts of typography to man is that of\ndetachment and noninvolvement — the power to act without reacting. Science\nsince the Renaissance has exalted this gift which has become an embarrassment\nin the electric age, in which all people are involved in all others at all\ntimes. The very word “disinterested,” expressing the loftiest detachment and\nethical integrity of typographic man, has in the past decade been increasingly\nused to mean: “He couldn’t care less.” The same integrity indicated by the\nterm “disinterested” as a mark of the scientific and scholarly temper of a\nliterate and enlightened society is now increasingly repudiated as\n“specialization” and fragmentation of knowledge and sensibility. The\nfragmenting and analytic power of the printed word in our psychic lives gave\nus that “dissociation of sensibility” which in the arts and literature since\nCézanne and since Baudelaire has been a top priority for elimination in every\nprogram of reform in taste and knowledge. In the “implosion” of the electric\nage the separation of thought and feeling has come to seem as strange as the\ndepartmentalization of knowledge in schools and universities. Yet is was\nprecisely the power to separate thought and feeling, to be able to act without\nreacting, that split literate man out of the tribal world of close family\nbonds in private and social life.\n\nTypography was no more an addition to the scribal art than the motorcar was an\naddition to the horse. Printing had its “horseless carriage” phase of being\nmisconceived and misapplied during its first decades, when it was not uncommon\nfor the purchaser of a printed book to take it to a scribe to have it copied\nand illustrated. Even in the early eighteenth century a “textbook” was still\ndefined as a \"“Classick Author written very wide by the Students, to give room\nfor an Interpretation dictated by the Master, &c., to be inserted in the\nInterlines”\" (O.E.D.). Before printing, much of the time in school and college\nclassrooms was spent in making such texts. The classroom tended to be a\n_scriptorium_ with a commentary. The student was an editor-publisher. By the\nsame token the book market was a secondhand market of relatively scarce items.\nPrinting changed learning and marketing processes alike. The book was the\nfirst teaching machine and also the first mass-produced commodity. In\namplifying and extending the written word, typography revealed and greatly\nextended the structure of writing. Today, with the cinema and the electric\nspeedup of information movement, the formal structure of the printed word, as\nof mechanism in general, stands forth like a branch washed up on the beach. A\nnew medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one\nin peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes\nand positions for them. Manuscript culture had sustained an oral procedure in\neducation that was called “scholasticism” at its higher levels; but by putting\nthe same text in front of any given number of students or readers print ended\nthe scholastic regime of oral disputation very quickly. Print provided a vast\nnew memory for past writings that made a personal memory inadequate.\n\nMargaret Mead has reported that when she brought several copies of the same\nbook to a Pacific island there was great excitement. The natives had seen\nbooks, but only one copy of each, which they had assumed to be unique. Their\nastonishment at the identical character of several books was a natural\nresponse to what is after all the most magical and potent aspect of print and\nmass production. It involves a principle of extension by homogenization that\nis the key to understanding Western power. The open society is open by virtue\nof a uniform typographic educational processing that permits indefinite\nexpansion of any group by additive means. The printed book based on\ntypographic uniformity and repeatability in the visual order was the first\nteaching machine, just as typography was the first mechanization of a\nhandicraft. Yet in spite of the extreme fragmentation or specialization of\nhuman action necessary to achieve the printed word, the printed book\nrepresents a rich composite of previous cultural inventions. The total effort\nembodied in the illustrated book in print offers a striking example of the\nvariety of separate acts of invention that are requisite to bring about a new\ntechnological result.\n\nThe psychic and social consequences of print included an extension of its\nfissile and uniform character to the gradual homogenization of diverse regions\nwith the resulting amplification of power, energy, and aggression that we\nassociate with new nationalisms. Psychically, the visual extension and\namplification of the individual by print had many effects. Perhaps as striking\nas any other is the one mentioned by Mr. E. M. Forster, who, when discussing\nsome Renaissance types, suggested that “the printing press, then only a\ncentury old, had been mistaken for an engine of immortality, and men had\nhastened to commit to it deeds and passions for the benefit of future ages.”\nPeople began to act as though immortality were inherent in the magic\nrepeatability and extensions of print.\n\nAnother significant aspect of the uniformity and repeatability of the printed\npage was the pressure it exerted toward “correct” spelling, syntax, and\npronunciation. Even more notable were the effects of print in separating\npoetry from song, and prose from oratory, and popular from educated speech. In\nthe matter of poetry it turned out that, as poetry could be read without being\nheard, musical instruments could also be played without accompanying any\nverses. Music veered from the spoken word, to converge again with Bartók and\nSchoenberg.\n\nWith typography the process of separation (or explosion) of functions went on\nswiftly at all levels and in all spheres; nowhere was this matter observed and\ncommented on with more bitterness than in the plays of Shakespeare. Especially\nin King Lear, Shakespeare provided an image or model of the process of\nquantification and fragmentation as it entered the world of politics and of\nfamily life. Lear at the very opening of the play presents \"“our darker\npurpose”\" as a plan of delegation of powers and duties:\n\n> Only we shall retain\n>\n> The name, an all th’addition to a King;\n>\n> The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,\n>\n> Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,\n>\n> This coronet part between you.\n\nThis act of fragmentation and delegation blasts Lear, his kingdom, and his\nfamily. Yet to divide and rule was the dominant new idea of the organization\nof power in the Renaissance. \"“Our darker purpose”\" refers to Machiavelli\nhimself, who had developed an individualist and quantitative idea of power\nthat struck more fear in that time than Marx in ours. Print, then, challenged\nthe corporate patterns of medieval organization as much as electricity now\nchallenges our fragmented individualism.\n\nThe uniformity and repeatability of print permeated the Renaissance with the\nidea of time and space as continuous measurable quantities. The immediate\neffect of this idea was to desacralize the world of nature and the world of\npower alike. The new technique of control of physical processes by\nsegmentation and fragmentation separated God and Nature as much as Man and\nNature, or man and man. Shock at this departure from traditional vision and\ninclusive awareness was often directed toward the figure of Machiavelli, who\nhad merely spelled out the new quantitative and neutral or scientific ideas of\nforce as applied to the manipulation of kingdoms.\n\nShakespeare’s entire work is taken up with the themes of the new delimitations\nof power, both kingly and private. No greater horror could be imagined in his\ntime than the spectacle of Richard II, the sacral king, undergoing the\nindignities of imprisonment and denudation of his sacred prerogatives. It is\nin Troilus and Cressida, however, that the new cults of fissile, irresponsible\npower, public and private, are paraded as a cynical charade of atomistic\ncompetition:\n\n> Take the instant way;\n>\n> For honour travels in a strait so narrow\n>\n> Where one but goes abreast: keep, then, the path;\n>\n> For emulation hath a thousand sons\n>\n> That one by one pursue: if you give way,\n>\n> Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,\n>\n> Like to an enter’d tide they all rush by\n>\n> And leave you hindmost …\n>\n> (III, iii)\n\nThe image of society as segmented into a homogeneous mass of quantified\nappetites shadows Shakespeare’s vision in the later plays.\n\nOf the many unforeseen consequences of typography, the emergence of\nnationalism is, perhaps, the most familiar. Political unification of\npopulations by means of vernacular and language groupings was unthinkable\nbefore printing turned each vernacular into an extensive mass medium. The\ntribe, an extended form of a family of blood relatives, is exploded by print,\nand is replaced by an association of men homogeneously trained to be\nindividuals. Nationalism itself came as an intense new visual image of group\ndestiny and status, and depended on a speed of information movement unknown\nbefore printing. Today nationalism as an image still depends on the press but\nhas all the electric media against it. In business, as in politics, the effect\nof even jet-plane speeds is to render the older national groupings of social\norganization quite unworkable. In the Renaissance it was the speed of print\nand the ensuing market and commercial developments that made nationalism\n(which is continuity and competition in homogeneous space) as natural as it\nwas new. By the same token, the heterogeneities and noncompetitive\ndiscontinuities of medieval guilds and family organization had become a great\nnuisance as speedup of information by print called for more fragmentation and\nuniformity of function. The Benvenuto Cellinis, the goldsmith-cum-painter-cum-\nsculptor-cum-writer-cum-condottiere, became obsolete.\n\nOnce a new technology comes into a social milieu it cannot cease to permeate\nthat milieu until every institution is saturated. Typography has permeated\nevery phase of the arts and sciences in the past five hundred years. It would\nbe easy to document the processes by which the principles of continuity,\nuniformity, and repeatability have become the basis of calculus and of\nmarketing, as of industrial production, entertainment, and science. It will be\nenough to point out that repeatability conferred on the printed book the\nstrangely novel character of a uniformly priced commodity opening the door to\nprice systems. The printed book had in addition the quality of portability and\naccessibility that had been lacking in the manuscript.\n\nDirectly associated with these expansive qualities was the revolution in\nexpression. Under manuscript conditions the role of being an author was a\nvague and uncertain one, like that of a minstrel. Hence, self-expression was\nof little interest. Typography, however, created a medium in which it was\npossible to speak out loud and bold to the world itself, just as it was\npossible to circumnavigate the world of books previously locked up in a\npluralistic world of monastic cells. Boldness of type created boldness of\nexpression.\n\nUniformity reached also into areas of speech and writing, leading to a single\ntone and attitude to reader and subject spread throughout an entire\ncomposition. The “man of letters” was born. Extended to the spoken word, this\nliterate _equitone_ enabled literate people to maintain a single “high tone”\nin discourse that was quite devastating, and enabled nineteenth-century prose\nwriters to assume moral qualities that few would now care to simulate.\nPermeation of the colloquial language with literate uniform qualities has\nflattened out educated speech till it is a very reasonable acoustic facsimile\nof the uniform and continuous visual effects of typography. From this\ntechnological effect follows the further fact that the humor, slang, and\ndramatic vigor of American-English speech are monopolies of the semi-literate.\n\nThese typographical matters for many people are charged with controversial\nvalues. Yet in any approach to understanding print it is necessary to stand\naside from the form in question if its typical pressure and life are to be\nobserved. Those who panic now about the threat of the newer media and about\nthe revolution we are forging, vaster in scope than that of Gutenberg, are\nobviously lacking in cool visual detachment and gratitude for that most potent\ngift bestowed on Western man by literacy and typography: his power to act\nwithout reaction or involvement. It is this kind of specialization by\ndissociation that has created Western power and efficiency. Without this\ndissociation of action from feeling and emotion people are hampered and\nhesitant. Print taught men to say, \"“Damn the torpedoes. Full steam ahead!”\"\n\n  *[O.E.D.]: Oxford English Dictionary\n\n\n![Wheel, Bicycle, and Airplane](images/title-19.png)\n\nThe kinds of interplay between wheel, bicycle, and airplane are startling to\nthose who have never thought about them. Scholars tend to work on the\narcheological assumption that things need to be studied in isolation. This is\nthe habit of specialism that quite naturally derives from typographic culture.\nWhen a scholar like Lynn White ventures to make some interrelations, even in\nhis own area of special historical study, he causes a good deal of unhappiness\namong his merely specialist colleagues. In his Medieval Technology and Social\nChange he explains how the feudal system was a social extension of the\nstirrup. The stirrup first appeared in the West in the eighth century a.d.,\nhaving been introduced from the East. With the stirrup came mounted shock\ncombat that called into existence a new social class. The European cavalier\nclass had already existed to be armed, but to mount a knight in full armor\nrequired the combined resources of ten or more peasant holdings. Charlemagne\ndemanded that less prosperous freemen merge their private farms to equip a\nsingle knight for the wars. The pressure of the new war technology gradually\ndeveloped classes and an economic system that could provide numerous cavaliers\nin heavy armor. By about the year 1000 a.d. the old word _miles_ had changed\nfrom “soldier” to “knight.”\n\nLynn White has much to say, also, about horseshoes and horsecollars as\nrevolutionary technology that increased the power and extended the range and\nspeed of human action in the early Middle Ages. He is sensitive to the psychic\nand social implications of each technological extension of man, showing how\nthe heavy wheel-plow brought about a new order in the field system, as well as\nin the diet of that age. \"“The Middle Ages were literally full of beans.”\"\n\nTo come more directly to our subject of the wheel, Lynn White explains how the\nevolution of the wheel in the Middle Ages was related to the development of\nthe horsecollar and the harness. The greater speed and endurance of the horse\nwas not available for cartage until the discovery of the collar. But once\nevolved, this horse-harness led to the development of wagons with pivoted\nfront axles and brakes. The four-wheel wagon capable of hauling heavy loads\nwas a common feature by the middle of the thirteenth century. The effects on\ntown life were extraordinary. Peasants began to live in cities while going\neach day to their fields, almost in the manner of motorized Saskatchewan\nfarmers. These latter live mainly in the city, having no housing in the\ncountry beyond sheds for their tractors and equipment.\n\nWith the coming of the horse-drawn bus and streetcar, American towns developed\nhousing that was no longer within sight of shop or factory. The railroad next\ntook over the development of the suburbs, with housing kept within walking\ndistance of the railroad stop. Shops and hotels around the railroad gave some\nconcentration and form to the suburb. The automobile, followed by the\nairplane, dissolved this grouping and ended the pedestrian, or human, scale of\nthe suburb. Lewis Mumford contends that the car turned the suburban housewife\ninto a full-time chauffeur. Certainly the transformations of the wheel as\nexpediter of tasks, and architect of ever-new human relations, is far from\nfinished, but its shaping power is waning in the electric age of information,\nand that fact makes us much more aware of its characteristic form as now\ntending toward the archaic.\n\nBefore the emergence of the wheeled vehicle, there was merely the abrasive\ntraction principle — runners, skids, and skis preceded wheels for vehicles,\njust as the abrasive, semirotary motion of the hand-operated spindle and drill\npreceded the full, free rotary motion of the potter’s wheel. There is a moment\nof translation or “abstraction” needed to separate the reciprocating movement\nof hand from the free movement of wheel. \"“Doubtless the notion of the wheel\ncame originally from observing that rolling a log was easier than shoving\nit,”\" writes Lewis Mumford in Technics and Civilization. Some might object\nthat log-rolling is closer to the spindle operation of the hands than to the\nrotary movement of feet, and need never have got translated into the\ntechnology of wheel. Under stress, it is more natural to fragment our own\nbodily form, and to let part of it go into another material, than it is to\ntransfer any of the motions of external objects into another material. To\nextend our bodily postures and motions into new materials, by way of\namplification, is a constant drive for more power. Most of our bodily stresses\nare interpreted as needs for extending storage and mobility functions, such as\noccur, also, in speech, money and writing. All manner of utensils are a\nyielding to this bodily stress by means of extensions of the body. The need\nfor storage and portability can readily be noted in vases, jars, and “slow\nmatches” (stored fire).\n\nPerhaps the main feature of all tools and machines — economy of gesture — is\nthe immediate expression of any physical pressure which impels us to outer or\nto extend ourselves, whether in words or in wheels. Man can say it with\nflowers or plows or locomotives. In “Krazy Kat,” Ignatz said it with bricks.\n\nOne of the most advanced and complicated uses of the wheel occurs in the movie\ncamera and in the movie projector. It is significant that this most subtle and\ncomplex grouping of wheels should have been invented in order to win a bet\nthat all four feet of a running horse were sometimes off the ground\nsimultaneously. This bet was made between the pioneer photographer Eadweard\nMuybridge and horse-owner Leland Stanford, in 1889. At first, a series of\ncameras were set up side by side, each to snap an arrested moment of the\nhorse’s hooves in action. The movie camera and the projector were evolved from\nthe idea of reconstructing mechanically the movement of feet. The wheel, that\nbegan as extended feet, took a great evolutionary step into the movie theater.\n\nBy an enormous speedup of assembly-line segments, the movie camera rolls up\nthe real world on a spool, to be unrolled and translated later onto the\nscreen. That the movie re-creates organic process and movement by pushing the\nmechanical principle to the point of reversal is a pattern that appears in all\nhuman extensions, whatever, as they reach a peak of performance. By speedup,\nthe airplane rolls up the highway into itself. The road disappears into the\nplane at take-off, and the plane becomes a missile, a self-contained\ntransportation system. At this point the wheel is reabsorbed into the form of\nbird or fish that the plane becomes as it takes to the air. Skin-divers need\nno path or road, and claim that their motion is like that of bird flight;\ntheir feet cease to exist as the progressive, sequential movement that is the\norigin of rotary action of the wheel. Unlike wing, or fin, the wheel is lineal\nand requires road for its completion.\n\nIt was the tandem alignment of wheels that created the velocipede and then the\nbicycle, for with the acceleration of wheel by linkage to the visual principle\nof mobile lineality, the wheel acquired a new degree of intensity. The bicycle\nlifted the wheel onto the plane of aerodynamic balance, and not too indirectly\ncreated the airplane. It was no accident that the Wright brothers were bicycle\nmechanics, or that early airplanes seemed in some ways like bicycles. The\ntransformations of technology have the character of organic evolution because\nall technologies are extensions of our physical being. Samuel Butler raised\ngreat admiration in Bernard Shaw by his insight that the evolutionary process\nhad been fantastically accelerated by transference to the machine mode. Shaw,\nhowever, was happy to leave the matter in this delightfully opaque state.\nButler, himself, had at least indicated that machines were given vicarious\npowers of reproduction by their subsequent impact upon the very bodies that\nhad brought them into being by extension. Response to the increased power and\nspeed of our own extended bodies is one which engenders new extensions. Every\ntechnology creates new stresses and needs in the human beings who have\nengendered it. The new need and the new technological response are born of our\nembrace of the already existing technology — a ceaseless process.\n\nThose familiar with the novels and plays of Samuel Beckett need not be\nreminded of the rich clowning he engenders by means of the bicycle. It is for\nhim the prime symbol of the Cartesian mind in its acrobatic relation of mind\nand body in precarious imbalance. This plight goes with a lineal progression\nthat mimics the very form of purposeful and resourceful independence of\naction. For Beckett, the integral being is not the acrobat but the clown. The\nacrobat acts as a specialist, using only a limited segment of his faculties.\nThe clown is the integral man who mimes the acrobat in an elaborate drama of\nincompetence. Beckett sees the bicycle as the sign and symbol of specialist\nfutility in the present electric age, when we must all interact and react,\nusing all our faculties at once.\n\nHumpty-Dumpty is the familiar example of the clown unsuccessfully imitating\nthe acrobat. Just because all the King’s horses and all the King’s men\ncouldn’t put Humpty-Dumpty together again, it doesn’t follow that\nelectromagnetic automation couldn’t have put Humpty-Dumpty back together. The\nintegral and unified egg had no business sitting on a wall anyway. Walls are\nmade of uniformly fragmented bricks that arise with specialisms and\nbureaucracies. They are the deadly enemies of integral beings like eggs.\nHumpty-Dumpty met the challenge of the wall with a spectacular collapse.\n\nThe same nursery rhyme comments on the consequences of the fall of Humpty-\nDumpty. That is the point about the King’s horses and men. They, too, are\nfragmented and specialized. Having no unified vision of the whole, they are\nhelpless. Humpty-Dumpty is an obvious example of integral wholeness. The mere\nexistence of the wall already spelt his fall. James Joyce in Finnegans Wake\nnever ceases to interlace these themes, and the title of the work indicates\nhis awareness that “a-stone-aging” as it may be, the electric age is\nrecovering the unity of plastic and iconic space, and is putting Humpty-Dumpty\nback together again.\n\nThe potter’s wheel, like all other technologies, was the acceleration of an\nexisting process. After nomad food-gathering had shifted to sedentary plowing\nand seeding, the need for storage increased. Pots were needed for more and\nmore purposes. Men turned their powers to changing the forms of things by\ncultivation. Change to special production in local areas created the need for\nexchange and for transport. For this purpose sledges were used in Northern\nEurope before 5000 b.c., and human porters and pack-bearing animals preceded\nsledges naturally. The wheel under the sledge was an accelerator of feet, not\nof hand. With this acceleration of the feet came the need for road, just as\nwith the extension of our backsides in the form of chair, came the need for\ntable. The wheel is an ablative absolute of feet, as chair is the ablative\nabsolute of backside. But when such ablatives intrude, they alter the syntax\nof society. There is no _ceteris paribus_ in the world of media and\ntechnology. Every extension or acceleration effects new configurations in the\nover-all situation at once.\n\nThe wheel made the road, and moved produce faster from fields to settlements.\nAcceleration created larger and larger centers, more and more specialism, and\nmore intense incentives, aggregates, and aggressions. So it is that the\nwheeled vehicle makes its appearance at once as a war chariot, just as the\nurban center, created by the wheel, makes its appearance as an aggressive\nstronghold. No further motivation than the compounding and consolidating of\nspecialist skills by acceleration of the wheel is needed to explain the\nmounting degree of human creativity and destructiveness.\n\nLewis Mumford calls this urbanization \"“implosion,”\" but it was really an\nexplosion. Cities were made by the fragmenting of pastoral modes. The wheel\nand the road expressed and advanced this explosion by a radiational or center-\nmargin pattern. Centralism depends on margins that are accessible by road and\nwheel. Maritime power does not assume this center-margin structure, and\nneither do desert and steppe cultures. Today with jet and electricity, urban\ncentralism and specialism reverse into decentralism and interplay of social\nfunctions in ever more nonspecialist forms.\n\nThe wheel and the road are centalizers because they accelerate up to a point\nthat ships cannot. But acceleration beyond a certain point, when it occurs by\nmeans of the automobile and the plane, creates decentralism in the midst of\nthe older centralism. This is the origin of the urban chaos of our time. The\nwheel, pushed beyond a certain intensity of movement, no longer centralizes.\nAll electric forms whatsoever have a decentralizing effect, cutting across the\nolder mechanical patterns like a bagpipe in a symphony. It is too bad that Mr.\nMumford has chosen the term \"“implosion”\" for the urban specialist explosion.\n“Implosion” belongs to the electronic age, as it belonged to the prehistoric\ncultures. All primitive societies are implosive, like the spoken word. But\n\"“technology is explicitness,”\" as Lyman Bryson said; and explicitness or\nspecialist extension of functions, is centralism and explosion of functions,\nand not implosion, contraction or simultaneity.\n\nAn airline executive who is much aware of the implosive character of world\naviation asked a corresponding executive of each airline in the world to send\nhim a pebble from outside his office. His idea was to build a little cairn of\npebbles from all parts of the world. When asked, “So what?” he said that in\none spot one could touch every part of the world because of aviation. In\neffect, he had hit upon the mosaic or iconic principle of simultaneous touch\nand interplay that is inherent in the implosive speed of the airplane. The\nsame principle of implosive mosaic is even more characteristic of electric\ninformation movement of all kinds.\n\nCentralism and extension of power by wheel and written word to the margins of\nempire are creative of the direct force, outside and external, to which men do\nnot necessarily submit their minds. But implosion is the spell and incantation\nof the tribe and the family, to which men readily submit. Under technological\nexplicitness, even of the urban centralist structure, some men managed to\nbreak out of the charmed circle of tribal magic. Mumford cites the words of\nthe Chinese philosopher Mencius as a comment on this situation:\n\n> When men are subdued by force they do not submit in their minds, but only\n> because their strength is inadequate. When men are subdued by power in\n> personality they are pleased to their very heart’s core and do really\n> submit.\n\nAs the expression of new specialist extensions of our bodies the congregating\nof people and supplies in centers by wheel and road called for endless\nreciprocal expansion in a spongelike action of intake and output, which has\nentrapped all urban structures everywhere in place and time. Mumford observes:\n\"“If I interpret the evidence correctly, the cooperative forms of urban polity\nwere undermined and vitiated from the outset by the destructive death-oriented\nmyths which attended … the exorbitant expansion of physical power and\ntechnological adroitness.”\" To have such power by extension of their own\nbodies, men must explode the inner unity of their beings into explicit\nfragments. Today, in an age of implosion, we are playing the ancient explosion\nbackward, as on a film. We can watch the pieces of man’s being coming together\nagain in an age that has so much power that the all-destructive use of it\nappears meaningless, even to the dim and skew of wit.\n\nHistorians see the forms of the great cities in the ancient world as\nmanifesting all facets of human personality. Institutions, architectural and\nadministrative, as extensions of our physical beings necessarily tend toward\nworldwide similarities. The central nervous system of the city was the citadel\nwhich included the great temple and palace of the king, invested with the\ndimensions and iconography of power and prestige. The extent to which this\ncentral core could extend its power safely depended on its power of acting at\na distance. Not until the alphabet appeared, together with papyrus, could the\ncitadel extend itself very far in space. (See the chapter on Roads and Paper\nRoutes.) The ancient city, however, could appear as quickly as specialist man\ncould separate his inner functions in space and architecture. To say that the\ncities of the Aztecs and the Peruvians resembled European cities is only to\nsay that they shared and extended the same faculties in both regions. The\nquestion of direct physical influence and imitation as if by diffusion becomes\nirrelevant.\n\n\n![The Photograph: The Brothel-without-Walls](images/title-20.png)\n\nA photograph of “St. Peter’s at a Moment of History” was the cover feature of\nLife magazine for June 14, 1963. It is one of the peculiar characteristics of\nthe photo that it isolates single moments in time. The TV camera does not. The\ncontinuous scanning action of the TV camera provides, not the isolated moment\nor aspect, but the contour, the iconic profile and the transparency. Egyptian\nart, like primitive sculpture today, provided the significant outline that had\nnothing to do with a moment in time. Sculpture tends toward the timeless.\n\nAwareness of the transforming power of the photo is often embodied in popular\nstories like the one about the admiring friend who said, \"“My, that’s a fine\nchild you have there!”\" Mother: “\"Oh, that’s nothing. You should see his\nphotograph.”\" The power of the camera to be everywhere and to interrelate\nthings is well indicated in the Vogue magazine boast (March 15, 1953): \"“A\nwoman now, and without having to leave the country, can have the best of five\n(or more) nations hanging in her closet—beautiful and compatible as a\nstatesman’s dream.”\" That is why, in the photographic age, fashions have come\nto be like the collage style in painting.\n\nA century ago the British craze for the monocle gave to the wearer the power\nof the camera to fix people in a superior stare, as if they were objects.\nErich von Stroheim did a great job with the monocle in creating the haughty\nPrussian officer. Both monocle and camera tend to turn people into things, and\nthe photograph extends and multiplies the human image to the proportions of\nmass-produced merchandise. The movie stars and matinee idols are put in the\npublic domain by photography. They become dreams that money can buy. They can\nbe bought and hugged and thumbed more easily than public prostitutes. Mass-\nproduced merchandise has always made some people uneasy in its prostitute\naspect. Jean Genet’s The Balcony is a play on this theme of society as a\nbrothel environed by violence and horror. The avid desire of mankind to\nprostitute itself stands up against the chaos of revolution. The brothel\nremains firm and permanent amidst the most furious changes. In a word,\nphotography has inspired Genet with the theme of the world since photography\nas a Brothel-without-Walls.\n\nNobody can commit photography alone. It is possible to have at least the\nillusion of reading and writing in isolation, but photography does not foster\nsuch attitudes. If there is any sense in deploring the growth of corporate and\ncollective art forms such as the film and the press, it is surely in relation\nto the previous individualist technologies that these new forms corrode. Yet\nif there had been no prints or woodcuts and engravings, there would never have\ncome the photograph. For centuries, the woodcut and the engraving had\ndelineated the world by an arrangement of lines and points that had syntax of\na very elaborate kind. Many historians of this visual syntax, like E. H.\nGombrich and William M. Ivins, have been at great pains to explain how the art\nof the hand-written manuscript had permeated the art of the woodcut and the\nengraving until, with the halftone process, the dots and lines suddenly fell\nbelow the threshold of normal vision. Syntax, the net of rationality,\ndisappeared from the later prints, just as it tended to disappear from the\ntelegraph message and from the impressionist painting. Finally, in the\n_pointillisme_ of Seurat, the world suddenly appeared _through_ the painting.\nThe direction of a syntactical point of view from outside onto the painting\nended as literary form dwindled into headlines with the telegraph. With the\nphotograph, in the same way, men had discovered how to make visual reports\nwithout syntax.\n\nIt was in 1839 that William Henry Fox Talbot read a paper to the Royal Society\nwhich had as title: \"“Some account of the Art of Photogenic Drawing, or the\nprocess by which Natural Objects may be made to delineate themselves without\nthe aid of the artist’s pencil.”\" He was quite aware of photography as a kind\nof automation that eliminated the syntactical procedures of pen and pencil. He\nwas probably less aware that he had brought the pictorial world into line with\nthe new industrial procedures. For photography mirrored the external world\nautomatically, yielding an exactly repeatable visual image. It was this all-\nimportant quality of uniformity and repeatability that had made the Gutenberg\nbreak between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Photography was almost as\ndecisive in making the break between mere mechanical industrialism and the\ngraphic age of electronic man. The step from the age of Typographic Man to the\nage of Graphic Man was taken with the invention of photography. Both\ndaguerreotypes and photographs introduced light and chemistry into the making\nprocess. Natural objects delineated themselves by an exposure intensified by\nlens and fixed by chemicals. In the daguerreotype process there was the same\nstippling or pitting with minute dots that was echoed later in Seurat’s\n_pointillisme_ , and is still continued in the newspaper mesh of dots that is\ncalled “wire-photo.” Within a year of Daguerre’s discovery, Samuel F. B. Morse\nwas taking photographs of his wife and daughter in New York City. Dots for the\neye (photograph) and dots for the ear (telegraph) thus met on top of a\nskyscraper.\n\nA further cross-fertilization occurred in Talbot’s invention of the photo,\nwhich he imagined as an extension of the _camera obscura_ , or pictures in\n“the little dark room,” as the Italians had named the picture play-box of the\nsixteenth century. Just at the time when mechanical writing had been achieved\nby movable types, there grew up the pastime of looking at moving images on the\nwall of a dark room. If there is sunshine outside and a pinhole in one wall,\nthen the images of the outer world will appear on the wall opposite. This new\ndiscovery was very exciting to painters, since it intensified the new illusion\nof perspective and of the third dimension that is so closely related to the\nprinted word. But the early spectators of the moving image in the sixteenth\ncentury saw those images upside down. For this reason the lens was introduced\n— in order to turn the picture right side up. Our normal vision is also upside\ndown. Psychically, we learn to turn our visual world right side up by\ntranslating the retinal impression from visual into tactile and kinetic terms.\nRight side up is apparently something we feel but cannot see directly.\n\nTo the student of media, the fact that “normal” right-side-up vision is a\ntranslation from one sense into another is a helpful hint about the kinds of\nactivity of distortion and translation that any language or culture induces in\nall of us. Nothing amuses the Eskimo more than for the white man to crane his\nneck to see the magazine pictures stuck on the igloo walls. For the Eskimo no\nmore needs to look at a picture right side up than does a child before he has\nlearned his letters _on a line_. Just why Westerners should be disturbed to\nfind that natives have to learn to read pictures, as we learn to read letters,\nis worth consideration. The extreme bias and distortion of our sense-lives by\nour technology would seem to be a fact that we prefer to ignore in our daily\nlives. Evidence that natives do not perceive in perspective or sense the third\ndimension seems to threaten the Western ego-image and structure, as many have\nfound after a trip through the Ames Perception Laboratory at Ohio State\nUniversity. This lab is arranged to reveal the various illusions we create for\nourselves in what we consider to be “normal” visual perception.\n\nThat we have accepted such bias and obliquity in a subliminal way through most\nof human history is clear enough. Just why we are no longer content to leave\nour experience in this subliminal state, and why many people have begun to get\nvery conscious about the unconscious, is a question well worth investigation.\nPeople are nowadays much concerned to set their houses in order, a process of\nself-consciousness that has received large impetus from photography.\n\nWilliam Henry Fox Talbot, delighting in Swiss scenery, began to reflect on the\n_camera obscura_ and wrote that \"“it was during these thoughts that the idea\noccurred to me … how charming it would be if it were possible to cause these\nnatural images to imprint themselves durably, and remain fixed on paper!”\" The\nprinting press had, in the Renaissance, inspired a similar desire to give\npermanence to daily feelings and experience.\n\nThe method Talbot devised was that of printing positives chemically from\nnegatives, to yield an exactly repeatable image. Thus the roadblock that had\nimpeded the Greek botanists and had defeated their successors was removed.\nMost of the sciences had been, from their origins, utterly handicapped by the\nlack of adequate nonverbal means of transmitting information. Today, even\nsubatomic physics would be unable to develop without the photograph.\n\nThe Sunday New York Times for June 15, 1958 reported:\n\n> ## Tiny Cells “Seen” By New Technique\n>\n> ### Microphoretic Method Spots Million-Billionth Of Gram, London Designer\n> Says\n>\n> Samples of substances weighing less than a million-billionth of a gram can\n> be analysed by a new British microscopic technique. This is the\n> \"“microphoretic method”\" by Bernard M. Turner, a London biochemical analyst\n> and instruments designer. It can be applied to the study of the cells of the\n> brain and nervous system, cell duplication including that in cancerous\n> tissue, and it will assist, it is believed, in the analyses of atmospheric\n> pollution by dust …\n>\n> In effect, an electric current pulls or pushes the different constituents of\n> the sample into zones where they would normally be invisible.\n\nHowever, to say that \"“the camera cannot lie”\" is merely to underline the\nmultiple deceits that are now practiced in its name. Indeed, the world of the\nmovie that was prepared by the photograph has become synonymous with illusion\nand fantasy, turning society into what Joyce called an \"“allnights newsery\nreel,”\" that substitutes a “reel” world for reality. Joyce knew more about the\neffects of the photograph on our senses, our language, and our thought\nprocesses than anybody else. His verdict on the \"“automatic writing”\" that is\nphotography was the _abnihilization_ of the etym. He saw the photo as at least\na rival, and perhaps a usurper, of the word, whether written or spoken. But if\n_etym_ (etymology) means the heart and core and moist substance of those\nbeings that we grasp in words, then Joyce may well have meant that the photo\nwas a new creation from nothing (_ab-nihil_), or even a reduction of creation\nto a photographic negative. If there is, indeed, a terrible nihilism in the\nphoto and a substitution of shadows for substance, then we are surely not the\nworse for knowing it. The technology of the photo is an extension of our own\nbeing and can be withdrawn from circulation like any other technology if we\ndecide that it is virulent. But amputation of such _extensions_ of our\nphysical being calls for as much knowledge and skill as are prerequisite to\nany other physical amputation.\n\nIf the phonetic alphabet was a technical means of severing the spoken word\nfrom its aspects of sound and gesture, the photograph and its development in\nthe movie _restored_ gesture to the human technology of recording experience.\nIn fact, the snapshot of arrested human postures by photography directed more\nattention to physical and psychic posture than ever before. The age of the\nphotograph has become the age of gesture and mime and dance, as no other age\nhas ever been. Freud and Jung built their observations on the interpretation\nof the languages of both individual and collective postures and gestures with\nrespect to dreams and to the ordinary acts of everyday life. The physical and\npsychic _gestalts_ , or “still” shots, with which they worked were much owing\nto the posture world revealed by the photograph. The photograph is just as\nuseful for collective, as for individual, postures and gestures, whereas\nwritten and printed language is biased toward the private and individual\nposture. Thus, the traditional figures of rhetoric were individual postures of\nmind of the private speaker in relation to an audience, whereas myth and\nJungian archetypes are collective postures of the mind with which the written\nform could not cope, any more than it could command mime and gesture.\nMoreover, that the photograph is quite versatile in revealing and arresting\nposture and structure wherever it is used, occurs in countless examples, such\nas the analysis of bird-flight. It was the photograph that revealed the secret\nof bird-flight and enabled man to take off. The photo, in arresting bird-\nflight, showed that it was based on a principle of wing _fixity_. Wing\nmovement was seen to be for propulsion, not for flight.\n\nPerhaps the great revolution produced by photograph was in the traditional\narts. The painter could no longer depict a world that had been much\nphotographed. He turned, instead, to reveal the inner process of creativity in\nexpressionism and in abstract art. Likewise, the novelist could no longer\ndescribe objects or happenings for readers who already knew what was happening\nby photo, press, film, and radio. The poet and novelist turned to those inward\ngestures of the mind by which we achieve insight and by which we make\nourselves and our world. Thus art moved from outer matching to inner making.\nInstead of depicting a world that matched the world we already knew, the\nartists turned to presenting the creative process for public participation. He\nhas given to us now the means of becoming involved in the making-process. Each\ndevelopment of the electric age attracts, and demands, a high degree of\nproducer-orientation. The age of the consumer of processed and packaged goods\nis, therefore, not the present electric age, but the mechanical age that\npreceded it. Yet, inevitably, the age of the mechanical has had to overlap\nwith the electric, as in such obvious instances as the internal combustion\nengine that requires the electric spark to ignite the explosion that moves its\ncylinders. The telegraph is an electric form that, when crossed with print and\nrotary presses, yields the modern newspaper. And the photograph is not a\nmachine, but a chemical and light process that, crossed with the machine,\nyields the movie. Yet there is a vigor and violence in these hybrid forms that\nis self-liquidating, as it were. For in radio and TV — purely electric forms\nfrom which the mechanical principle has been excluded — there is an altogether\nnew relation of the medium to its users. This is a relation of high\nparticipation and involvement that, for good or ill, no mechanism had ever\nevoked.\n\nEducation is ideally civil defense against media fall-out. Yet Western man has\nhad, so far, no education or equipment for meeting any of the new media on\ntheir own terms. Literate man is not only numb and vague in the presence of\nfilm or photo, but he intensifies his ineptness by a defensive arrogance and\ncondescension to \"“pop kulch”\" and \"“mass entertainment.”\" It was in this\nspirit of bulldog opacity that the scholastic philosophers failed to meet the\nchallenge of the printed book in the sixteenth century. The vested interests\nof acquired knowledge and conventional wisdom have always been by-passed and\nengulfed by new media. The study of this process, however, whether for the\npurpose of fixity or of change, has scarcely begun. The notion that self-\ninterest confers a keener eye for recognizing and controlling the processes of\nchange is quite without foundation, as witness the motorcar industry. Here is\na world of obsolescence as surely doomed to swift erosion as was the\nenterprise of the buggy- and wagon-makers in 1915. Yet does General Motors,\nfor example, know, or even suspect, anything about the effect of the TV image\non the users of motorcars? The magazine enterprises are similarly undermined\nby the TV image and its effect on the advertising icon. The meaning of the new\nad icon has not been grasped by those who stand to lose all. The same is true\nof the movie industry in general. Each of these enterprises lacks any\n“literacy” in any medium but its own, and thus the startling changes resulting\nfrom new hybrids and crossings of media catch them unawares.\n\nTo the student of media structures, every detail of the total mosaic of the\ncontemporary world is vivid with meaningful life. As early as March 15, 1953,\nVogue magazine announced a new hybrid, resulting from a cross between\nphotograph and air travel:\n\n> This first International Fashion Issue of Vogue is to mark a new point. We\n> couldn’t have done such an issue before. Fashion only got its\n> internationalization papers a short time ago, and for the first time in one\n> issue we can report on couture collections in five countries.\n\nThe advantages of such ad copy as high-grade ore in the lab of the media\nanalyst can be recognized only by those trained in the language of vision and\nof the plastic arts in general. The copy writer has to be a strip-tease artist\nwho has entire empathy with the immediate state of mind of the audience. Such,\nindeed, is also the aptitude of the popular novelist or song writer. It\nfollows that any widely accepted writer or entertainer embodies and reveals a\ncurrent set of attitudes that can be verbalized by the analyst. \"“Do you read\nme, Mac?”\" But were the words of the Vogue writer to be considered merely on\nliterary or editorial grounds, their meaning would be missed, just as the copy\nin a pictorial ad is not to be considered as literary statement but as mime of\nthe psychopathology of everyday life. In the age of the photograph, language\ntakes on a graphic or iconic character, whose “meaning” belongs very little to\nthe semantic universe, and not at all to the republic of letters.\n\nIf we open a 1938 copy of Life, the pictures or postures then seen as normal\nnow give a sharper sense of remote time than do objects of real antiquity.\nSmall children now attach the phrase “the olden days” to yesterday’s hats and\novershoes, so keenly are they attuned to the abrupt seasonal changes of visual\nposture in the world of fashions. But the basic experience here is one that\nmost people feel for yesterday’s newspaper, than which nothing could be more\ndrastically out of fashion. Jazz musicians express their distaste for recorded\njazz by saying, \"“it is as stale as yesterday’s newspaper.”\"\n\nPerhaps that is the readiest way to grasp the meaning of the photograph in\ncreating a world of accelerated transience. For the relation we have to\n“today’s newspaper,” or verbal jazz, is the same that people feel for\nfashions. Fashion is not a way of being informed or aware, but a way of being\n_with it_. That, however, is merely to draw attention to a negative aspect of\nthe photograph. Positively, the effect of speeding up temporal sequence is to\nabolish time, much as the telegraph and cable abolished space. Of course the\nphotograph does both. It wipes out our national frontiers and cultural\nbarriers, and involves us in The Family of Man, regardless of any particular\npoint of view. A picture of a group of persons of any hue whatever is a\npicture of people, not of \"“colored people.”\" That is the logic of the\nphotograph, politically speaking. But the logic of the photograph is neither\nverbal nor syntactical, a condition which renders literary culture quite\nhelpless to cope with the photograph. By the same token, the complete\ntransformation of human sense-awareness by this form involves a development of\nself-consciousness that alters facial expression and cosmetic makeup as\nimmediately as it does our bodily stance, in public or in private. This fact\ncan be gleaned from any magazine or movie of fifteen years back. It is not too\nmuch to say, therefore, that if outer posture is affected by the photograph,\nso with our inner postures and the dialogue with ourselves. The age of Jung\nand Freud is, above all, the age of the photograph, the age of the full gamut\nof self-critical attitudes.\n\nThis immense tidying-up of our inner lives, motivated by the new picture\n_gestalt_ culture, has had its obvious parallels in our attempts to rearrange\nour homes and gardens and our cities. To see a photograph of the local slum\nmakes the condition unbearable. The mere matching of the picture with reality\nprovides a new motive for change, as it does a new motive for travel.\n\nDaniel Boorstin in The Image: or What Happened to the American Dream offers a\nconducted _literary_ tour of the new photographic world of travel. One has\nmerely to look at the new tourism in a literary perspective to discover that\nit makes no sense at all. To the literary man who has read about Europe, in\nleisurely anticipation of a visit, an ad that whispers: \"“You are just fifteen\n_gourmet_ meals from Europe on the world’s fastest ship”\" is gross and\nrepugnant. Advertisements of travel by plane are worse: \"“Dinner in New York,\nindigestion in Paris.”\" Moreover, the photograph has reversed the purpose of\ntravel, which until now had been to encounter the strange and unfamiliar.\nDescartes, in the early seventeenth century, had observed that traveling was\nalmost like conversing with men of other centuries, a point of view quite\nunknown before his time. For those who cherish such quaint experience, it is\nnecessary today to go back very many centuries by the art and archaeology\nroute. Professor Boorstin seems unhappy that so many Americans travel so much\nand are changed by it so little. He feels that the entire travel experience\nhas become \"“diluted, contrived, prefabricated.”\" He is not concerned to find\nout why the photograph has done this to us. But in the same way intelligent\npeople in the past always deplored the way in which the book had become a\nsubstitute for inquiry, conversation, and reflection, and never troubled to\nreflect on the nature of the printed book. The book reader has always tended\nto be passive, because that is the best way to read. Today, the traveler has\nbecome passive. Given travelers checks, a passport, and a toothbrush, the\nworld is your oyster. The macadam road, the railroad, and the steamship have\ntaken the _travail_ out of travel. People moved by the silliest whims now\nclutter the foreign places, because travel differs very little from going to a\nmovie or turning the pages of a magazine. The \"“Go Now, Pay Later”\" formula of\nthe travel agencies might as well read: \"“Go now, arrive later,”\" for it could\nbe argued that such people never really leave their beaten paths of\nimpercipience, nor do they ever arrive at any new place. They can have\nShanghai or Berlin or Venice in a package tour that they need never open. In\n1961, TWA began to provide new movies for its trans-Atlantic flights so that\nyou could visit Portugal, California, or anywhere else, while en-route to\nHolland, for example. Thus the world itself becomes a sort of museum of\nobjects that have been encountered before in some other medium. It is well\nknown that even museum curators often prefer colored pictures to the originals\nof various objects in their own cases. In the same way, the tourist who\narrives at the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or the Grand Canyon of Arizona, can now\nmerely check his reactions to something with which he has long been familiar,\nand take his own pictures of the same.\n\nTo lament that the packaged tour, like the photograph, cheapens and degrades\nby making all places easy of access, is to miss most of the game. It is to\nmake value judgments with _fixed_ reference to the fragmentary perspective of\nliterary culture. It is the same position that considers a literary landscape\nas superior to a movie travelogue. For the untrained awareness, all reading\nand all movies, like all travel are equally banal and unnourishing as\nexperience. Difficulty of access does not confer adequacy of perception,\nthough it may involve an object in an aura of pseudo-values, as with a gem, a\nmovie star, or an old master. This now brings us to the factual core of the\n\"“pseudoevent,”\" a label applied to the new media, in general, because of\ntheir power to give new patterns to our lives by acceleration of older\npatterns. It is necessary to reflect that this same insidious power was once\nfelt in the _old_ media, including languages. All media exist to invest our\nlives with artificial perception and arbitrary values.\n\nAll meaning alters with acceleration, because all patterns of personal and\npolitical interdependence change with any acceleration of information. Some\nfeel keenly that speedup has impoverished the world they knew by changing its\nforms of human interassociation. There is nothing new or strange in a\nparochial preference for those pseudo-events that happened to enter into the\ncomposition of society just before the electric revolution of this century.\nThe student of media soon comes to expect the new media of any period whatever\nto be classed as _pseudo_ by those who have acquired the patterns of earlier\nmedia, whatever they may happen to be. This would seem to be a normal, and\neven amiable, trait ensuring a maximal degree of social continuity and\npermanence amidst change and innovation. But all the conservatism in the world\ndoes not afford even a token resistance to the ecological sweep of the new\nelectric media. On a moving highway the vehicle that backs up is accelerating\nin relation to the highway situation. Such would seem to be the ironical\nstatus of the cultural reactionary. When the trend is one way his resistance\ninsures a greater speed of change. Control over change would seem to consist\nin moving not with it but ahead of it. Anticipation gives the power to deflect\nand control force. Thus we may feel like a man who has been hustled away from\nhis favorite knothole in the ball park by a frantic rout of fans eager to see\nthe arrival of a movie star. We are no sooner in position to look at one kind\nof event than it is obliterated by another, just as our Western lives seem to\nnative cultures to be one long series of _preparations for living_. But the\nfavorite stance of literary man has long been \"“to view with alarm”\" or \"“to\npoint with pride,”\" while scrupulously ignoring what’s going on.\n\nOne immense area of photographic influence that affects our lives is the world\nof packaging and display and, in general, the organization of shops and stores\nof every kind. The newspaper that could advertise every sort of product on one\npage quickly gave rise to department stores that provided every kind of\nproduct under one roof. Today the decentralizing of such institutions into a\nmultiplicity of small shops in shopping plazas is partly the creation of the\ncar, partly the result of TV. But the photograph still exerts some centralist\npressure in the mail-order catalogue. Yet the mail-order houses originally\nfelt not only the centralist forces of railway and postal services, but also,\nand at the same time, the decentralizing power of the telegraph. The Sears\nRoebuck enterprise was directly owing to stationmaster use of the telegraph.\nThese men saw that the waste of goods on railway sidings could be ended by the\nspeed of the telegraph to reroute and concentrate.\n\nThe complex network of media, other than the photograph that appears in the\nworld of merchandising, is easier to observe in the world of sports. In one\ninstance, the press camera contributed to radical changes in the game of\nfootball. A press photo of battered players in a 1905 game between\nPennsylvania and Swarthmore came to the attention of President Teddy\nRoosevelt. He was so angered at the picture of Swarthmore’s mangled Bob\nMaxwell that he issued an immediate ultimatum — that if rough play continued,\nhe would abolish the game by executive edict. The effect was the same as that\nof the harrowing telegraph reports of Russell from the Crimea, which created\nthe image and role of Florence Nightingale.\n\nNo less drastic was the effect of the press photo coverage of the lives of the\nrich. \"“Conspicuous consumption”\" owed less to the phrase of Veblen than to\nthe press photographer, who began to invade the entertainment spots of the\nvery rich. The sights of men ordering drinks from horseback at the bars of\nclubs quickly caused a public revulsion that drove the rich into the ways of\ntimid mediocrity and obscurity in America, which they have never abandoned.\nThe photograph made it quite unsafe to come out and play, for it betrayed such\nblatant dimensions of power as to be self-defeating. On the other hand, the\nmovie phase of photography created a new aristocracy of actors and actresses,\nwho dramatized, on and off the screen, the fantasia of conspicuous consumption\nthat the rich could never achieve. The movie demonstrated the magic power of\nthe photo by providing a consumer package of plutocratic dimension for all the\nCinderellas in the world.\n\nThe Gutenberg Galaxy provides the necessary background for studying the rapid\nrise of new visual values after the advent of printing from movable types. \"“A\nplace for everything and everything in its place”\" is a feature not only of\nthe compositor’s arrangement of his type fonts, but of the entire range of\nhuman organization of knowledge and action from the sixteenth century onward.\nEven the inner life of the feelings and emotions began to be structured and\nordered and analyzed according to separate pictorial landscapes, as\nChristopher Hussey explained in his fascinating study of The Picturesque. More\nthan a century of this pictorial analysis of the inner life preceded Talbot’s\n1839 discovery of photography. Photography, by carrying the pictorial\ndelineation of natural objects much further than paint or language could do,\nhad a _reverse_ effect. By conferring a means of self-delineation of objects,\nof \"“statement without syntax,”\" photography gave the impetus to a delineation\nof the inner world. Statement without syntax or verbalization was really\nstatement by gesture, by mime, and by _gestalt_ , This new dimension opened\nfor human inspection by poets like Baudelaire and Rimbaud _le paysage\nintérieur_ , or the countries of the mind. Poets and painters invaded this\ninner landscape world long before Freud and Jung brought their cameras and\nnotebooks to capture states of mind. Perhaps most spectacular of all was\nClaude Bernard, whose Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine\nushered science into _le milieu intérieur_ of the body exactly at the time\nwhen the poets did the same for the life of perception and feeling.\n\nIt is important to note that this ultimate stage of pictorialization was a\nreversal of pattern. The world of body and mind observed by Baudelaire and\nBernard was not photographical at all, but a nonvisual set of relations such\nas the physicist, for example, had encountered by means of the new mathematics\nand statistics. The photograph might be said, also, to have brought to human\nattention the subvisual world of bacteria that caused Louis Pasteur to be\ndriven from the medical profession by his indignant colleagues. Just as the\npainter Samuel Morse had unintentionally projected himself into the nonvisual\nworld of the telegraph, so the photograph really transcends the pictorial by\ncapturing the inner gestures and postures of both body and mind, yielding the\nnew worlds of endocrinology and psychopathology.\n\nTo understand the medium of the photograph is quite impossible, then, without\ngrasping its relations to other media, both old and new. For media, as\nextensions of our physical and nervous systems, constitute a world of\nbiochemical interactions that must ever seek new equilibrium as new extensions\noccur. In America, people can tolerate their images in mirror or photo, but\nthey are made uncomfortable by the recorded sound of their own voices. The\nphoto and visual worlds are secure areas of anesthesia.\n\n  *[TWA]: Trans World Airlines\n\n\n![Press: Government by News Leak](images/title-21.png)\n\nThe headline for an Associated Press release (February 25, 1963) read:\n\n> ## Press Blamed For Success\n>\n> ### Kennedy Manages News Boldly,  \n>  Cynically, Subtly, Krock Claims\n\nArthur Krock is quoted as saying that \"“the principle onus rests on the\nprinted and electronic process itself.”\" That may seem like another way of\nsaying that \"“history is to blame.”\" But it is the instant consequences of\nelectrically moved information that makes necessary a deliberate artistic aim\nin the placing and management of news. In diplomacy the same electric speed\ncauses the decisions to be announced before they are made in order to\nascertain the varying responses that might occur when such decisions actually\nare made. Such procedure, quite inevitable at the electric speed that involves\nthe entire society in the decision-making process, shocks the old press men\nbecause it abdicates any definite point of view. As the speed of information\nincreases, the tendency is for politics to move away from representation and\ndelegation of constituents toward immediate involvement of the entire\ncommunity in the central acts of decision. Slower speeds of information make\ndelegation and representation mandatory. Associated with such delegation are\nthe points of view of the different sectors of public interest that are\nexpected to be put forward for processing and consideration by the rest of the\ncommunity. When the electric speed is introduced into such a delegated and\nrepresentational organization, this obsolescent organization can only be made\nto function by a series of subterfuges and makeshifts. These strike some\nobservers as base betrayals of the original aims and purposes of the\nestablished forms.\n\nThe massive theme of the press can be managed only by direct contact with the\nformal patterns of the medium in question. It is thus necessary to state at\nonce that “human interest” is a technical term meaning that which happens when\nmultiple book pages or multiple information items are arranged in a mosaic on\none sheet. The book is a private confessional form that provides a “point of\nview.” The press is a group confessional form that provides communal\nparticipation. It can “color” events by using them or by not using them at\nall. But it is the daily communal exposure of multiple items in juxtaposition\nthat gives the press its complex dimension of human interest.\n\nThe book form is not a communal mosaic or corporate image but a private voice.\nOne of the unexpected effects of TV on the press has been a great increase in\nthe popularity of Time and Newsweek. Quite inexplicably to themselves and\nwithout any new effort at subscription, their circulations have more than\ndoubled since TV. These news magazines are preeminently mosaic in form,\noffering not windows on the world like the old picture magazines, but\npresenting corporate images of society in action. Whereas the spectator of a\npicture magazine is passive, the reader of a news magazine becomes much\ninvolved in the making of meanings for the corporate image. Thus the TV habit\nof involvement in mosaic image has greatly strengthened the appeal of these\nnews magazines, but at the same time has diminished the appeal of the older\npictorial feature magazines.\n\nBoth book and newspaper are confessional in character, creating the effect of\n_inside story_ by their mere form, regardless of content. As the book page\nyields the inside story of the author’s mental adventures, so the press page\nyields the inside story of the community in action and interaction. It is for\nthis reason that the press seems to be performing its function most when\nrevealing the seamy side. Real news is bad news — bad news _about_ somebody,\nor bad news _for_ somebody. In 1962, when Minneapolis had been for months\nwithout a newspaper, the chief of police said: \"“Sure, I miss the news, but so\nfar as my job goes I hope the papers never come back. There is less crime\naround without a newspaper to pass around the ideas.”\"\n\nEven before the telegraph speedup, the newspaper of the nineteenth century had\nmoved a long way toward a mosaic form. Rotary steam presses came into use\ndecades before electricity, but typesetting by hand remained more satisfactory\nthan any mechanical means until development of linotype about 1890. With\nlinotype, the press could adjust its form more fully to the news-gathering of\nthe telegraph and the newsprinting of the rotary presses. It is typical and\nsignificant that the linotype answer to the long-standing slowness of\ntypesetting did not come from those directly engaged with the problem.\nFortunes had been vainly spent on typesetting machines before James Clephane,\nseeking a fast way of writing out and duplicating shorthand notes, found a way\nto combine the typewriter and the typesetter. It was the _typewriter_ that\nsolved the utterly different _typesetting_ problem. Today the publishing of\nbook and newspaper both depends on the typewriter.\n\nThe speedup of information gathering and publishing naturally created new\nforms of arranging material for readers. As early as 1830 the French poet\nLamartine had said, \"“The book arrives too late,”\" drawing attention to the\nfact that the book and the newspaper are quite different forms. Slow down\ntypesetting and news-gathering, and there occurs a change, not only in the\nphysical appearance of the press, but also in the prose style of those writing\nfor it. The first great change in style came early in the eighteenth century,\nwhen the famous Tatler and Spectator of Addison and Steele discovered a new\nprose technique to match the form of the printed word. It was the technique of\nequitone. It consisted in maintaining a single level of tone and attitude to\nthe reader throughout the entire composition. By this discovery, Addison and\nSteele brought written discourse into line with the printed word and away from\nthe variety of pitch and tone of the spoken, and of even the hand-written,\nword. This way of bringing language into line with print must be clearly\nunderstood. The telegraph broke language away again from the printed word, and\nbegan to make erratic noises called headlines, journalese, and telegraphese —\nphenomena that still dismay the literary community with its mannerisms of\nsupercilious equitone that mime typographic uniformity. Headlines produce such\neffects as\n\n> ### Barber Hones Tonsils  \n>  For Old-Timer's Event\n\nreferring to Sal (the Barber) Maglie, the swarthy curve-ball artist with the\nold Brooklyn Dodgers, when he was to be guest speaker at a Ball Club dinner.\nThe same community admires the varied tonality and vigor of Aretino, Rabelais,\nand Nashe, all of whom wrote prose before the print pressure was strong enough\nto reduce the language gestures to uniform lineality. Talking with an\neconomist who was serving on an unemployment commission, I asked him whether\nhe had considered newspaper reading as a form of paid employment. I was not\nwrong in supposing that he would be incredulous. Nevertheless, all media that\nmix ads with other programming are a form of “paid learning.” In years to\ncome, when the child will be paid to learn, educators will recognize the\nsensational press as the forerunner of paid learning. One reason that it was\ndifficult to see this fact earlier is that the processing and moving of\ninformation had not been the main business of a mechanical and industrial\nworld. It is, however, easily the dominant business and means of wealth in the\nelectric world. At the end of the mechanical age people still imagined that\npress and radio and even TV were merely forms of information paid for by the\nmakers and users of “hardware” like cars and soap and gasoline. As automation\ntakes hold, it becomes obvious that _information_ is the crucial commodity,\nand that solid products are merely incidental to information movement. The\nearly stages by which information itself became the basic economic commodity\nof the electric age were obscured by the ways in which advertising and\nentertainment put people off the track. Advertisers pay for space and time in\npaper and magazine, on radio and TV; that is, they buy a piece of the reader,\nlistener, or viewer as definitely as if they hired our homes for a public\nmeeting. They would gladly pay the reader, listener, or viewer directly for\nhis time and attention if they knew how to do so. The only way so far devised\nis to put on a free show. Movies in America have not developed advertising\nintervals simply because the movie itself is the greatest of all forms of\nadvertisement for consumer goods.\n\nThose who deplore the frivolity of the press and its natural form of group\nexposure and communal cleansing simply ignore the nature of the medium and\ndemand that it be a book, as it tends to be in Europe. The book arrived in\nwestern Europe long before the newspaper; but Russia and middle Europe\ndeveloped the book and newspaper almost together, with the result that they\nhave never unscrambled the two forms. Their journalism exudes the private\npoint of view of the literary mandarin. British and American journalism,\nhowever, have always tended to exploit the mosaic form of the newspaper format\nin order to present the discontinuous variety and incongruity of ordinary\nlife. The monotonous demands of the literary community — that the newspaper\nuse its mosaic form to present a fixed point of view on a single plane of\nperspective — represent a failure to see the form of the press at all. It is\nas if the public were suddenly to demand that department stores have only one\ndepartment.\n\nThe classified ads (and stock-market quotations) are the bedrock of the press.\nShould an alternative source of easy access to such diverse daily information\nbe found, the press will fold. Radio and TV can handle the sports, news,\ncomics, and pictures. The editorial, which is the one book-feature of the\nnewspaper, has been ignored for many years, unless put in the form of news or\npaid advertisement.\n\nIf our press is in the main a free entertainment service paid for by\nadvertisers who want to buy readers, the Russian press is _in toto_ the basic\nmode of industrial promotion. If we use news, political and personal, as\nentertainment to capture ad readers, the Russians use it as a means of\npromotion for their economy. Their political news has the same aggressive\nearnestness and posture as the voice of the sponsor in an American ad. A\nculture that gets the newspaper late (for the same reasons that\nindustrialization is delayed) and one that accepts the press as a form of the\nbook and regards industry as group political action, is not likely to seek\nentertainment in the news. Even in America, literate people have small skill\nin understanding the iconographic varieties of the ad world. Ads are ignored\nor deplored, but seldom studied and enjoyed.\n\nAnybody who could think that the press has the same function in America and\nRussia, or in France and China, is not really in touch with the medium. Are we\nto suppose that this kind of media illiteracy is characteristic only of\nWesterners, and that Russians know how to correct the bias of the medium in\norder to read it right? Or do people vaguely suppose that the heads of state\nin the various countries of the world know that the newspaper has totally\ndiverse effects in different cultures? There is no basis for such assumptions.\nUnawareness of the nature of the press in its subliminal or latent action is\nas common among politicians as among political scientists. For example, in\noral Russia both Pravda and Izvestia handle domestic news, but the big\ninternational themes come to the West over Radio Moscow. In visual America,\nradio and television handle the domestic stories, and international affairs\nget their formal treatment in Time magazine and The New York Times. As a\nforeign service, the bluntness of Voice of America in no way compares to the\nsophistication of the BBC and Radio Moscow, but what it lacks in verbal\ncontent it makes up in the entertainment value of its American jazz. The\nimplications of this difference of stress are important for an understanding\nof the kinds of opinions and decisions natural to an oral, as opposed to a\nvisual, culture.\n\nA friend of mine who tried to teach something about the forms of media in\nsecondary school was struck by one unanimous response. The students could not\nfor a moment accept the suggestion that the press or any other public means of\ncommunication could be used with base intent. They felt that this would be\nakin to polluting the air or the water supply, and they didn’t feel that their\nfriends and relatives employed in these media would sink to such corruption.\nFailure in perception occurs precisely in giving attention to the program\n“content” of our media while ignoring the form, whether it be radio or print\nor the English language itself. There have been countless Newton Minows\n(formerly head of the Federal Communications Commission) to talk about the\nWasteland of the Media, men who know nothing about the form of any medium\nwhatever. They imagine that a more earnest tone and a more austere theme would\npull up the level of the book, the press, the movie, and TV. They are wrong to\na farcical degree. They have only to try out their theory for fifty\nconsecutive words in the mass medium of the English language. What would Mr.\nMinow do, what would any advertiser do, without the well-worn and corny\nclichés of popular speech? Suppose that we were to try for a few sentences to\nraise the level of our daily English conversation by a series of sober and\nserious sentiments? Would this be a way of getting at the problems of\nimproving the medium? If all English were enunciated at a Mandarin level of\nuniform elegance and sententiousness, would the language and its users be\nbetter served? There comes to mind the remark of Artemus Ward that\n\"“Shakespeare wrote good plays but he wouldn’t have succeeded as the\nWashington correspondent of a New York daily newspaper. He lacked the reckisit\nfancy and imagination.”\"\n\nThe book-oriented man has the illusion that the press would be better without\nads and without the pressure from the advertiser. Reader surveys have\nastonished even publishers with the revelation that the roving eyes of\nnewspaper readers take equal satisfaction in ads and news copy. During the\nSecond War, the U.S.O. sent special issues of the principal American magazines\nto the Armed Forces, with the ads omitted. The men insisted on having the ads\nback again. Naturally. The ads are by far the best part of any magazine or\nnewspaper. More pains and thought, more wit and art go into the making of an\nad than into any prose feature of press or magazine. Ads are _news_. What is\nwrong with them is that they are always _good_ news. In order to balance off\nthe effect and to sell good news, it is necessary to have a lot of bad news.\nMoreover, the newspaper is a hot medium. It has to have bad news for the sake\nof intensity and reader participation. _Real_ news is _bad_ news, as already\nnoted, and as any newspaper from the beginning of print can testify. Floods,\nfires, and other communal disasters by land and sea and air outrank any kind\nof private horror or villainy as _news_. Ads, in contrast, have to shrill\ntheir happy message loud and clear in order to match the penetrating power of\nbad news.\n\nCommentators on the press and the American Senate have noted that since the\nSenate began its prying into unsavory subjects it has assumed a role superior\nto Congress. In fact, the great disadvantage of the Presidency and the\nExecutive arm in relation to public opinion is that it tries to be a source of\ngood news and noble directive. On the other hand, Congressmen and Senators\nhave the free of the seamy side so necessary to the vitality of the press.\n\nSuperficially, this may seem cynical, especially to those who imagine that the\ncontent of a medium is a matter of policy and personal preference, and for\nwhom all corporate media, not only radio and the press but ordinary popular\nspeech as well, are debased forms of human expression and experience. Here I\nmust repeat that the newspaper, from its beginnings, has tended, not to the\nbook form, but to the mosaic or participational form. With the speedup of\nprinting and news-gathering, this mosaic form has become a dominant aspect of\nhuman association; for the mosaic form means, not a detached “point of view,”\nbut participation in process. For that reason, the press is inseparable from\nthe democratic process, but quite expendable from a literary or book point of\nview.\n\nAgain, the book-oriented man misunderstands the collective mosaic form of the\npress when he complains about its endless reports on the seamy underside of\nthe social garment. Both book and press are, in their very format, dedicated\nto the job of revealing the inside story, whether it is Montaigne giving to\nthe private reader the delicate contours of his mind, or Hearst and Whitman\nresonating their barbaric yawps over the roofs of the world. It is the printed\nform of public address and high intensity with its precise uniformity of\nrepetition that gives to book and press alike the special character of public\nconfessional.\n\nThe first items in the press to which all men turn are the ones about which\nthey already know. If we have witnessed some event, whether a ball game or a\nstock crash or a snow-storm, we turn to the report of that happening, first.\nWhy? The answer is central to any understanding of media. Why does a child\nlike to chatter about the events of its day, however jerkily? Why do we prefer\nnovels and movies about familiar scenes and characters? Because for rational\nbeings to see or re-cognize their experience in a new material form is an\nunbought grace of life. Experience translated into a new medium literally\nbestows a delightful playback of earlier awareness. The press repeats the\nexcitement we have in using our wits, and by using our wits we can translate\nthe outer world into the fabric of our own beings. This excitement of\ntranslation explains why people quite naturally wish to use their senses all\nthe time. Those external extensions of sense and faculty that we call media we\nuse as constantly as we do our eyes and ears, and from the same motives. On\nthe other hand, the book-oriented man considers this nonstop use of media as\ndebased; it is unfamiliar to him in the book-world.\n\nUp to this point we have discussed the press as a mosaic successor to the\nbook-form. The mosaic is the mode of the corporate or collective image and\ncommands deep participation. This participation is communal rather than\nprivate, inclusive rather than exclusive. Further features of its form can\nbest be grasped by a few random views taken from outside the present form of\nthe press. Historically, for example, newspapers had waited for news to come\nto them. The first American newspaper, issued in Boston by Benjamin Harris on\nSeptember 25, 1690, announced that it was to be \"“furnished once a month (or\nif any Glut of Occurrences happen, oftener).”\" Nothing could more plainly\nindicate the idea that news was something outside and beyond the newspaper.\nUnder such rudimentary conditions of awareness, a principal function of the\nnewspaper was to correct rumors and oral reports, as a dictionary might\nprovide “correct” spellings and meanings for words that had long existed\nwithout the benefit of dictionaries. Fairly soon the press began to sense that\nnews was not only to be reported but also gathered, and, indeed, to be made.\nWhat went _into_ the press was news. The rest was not news. \"“He made the\nnews”\" is a strangely ambiguous phrase, since to be in the newspaper is both\nto be news and to make news. Thus “making the news,” like “making good,”\nimplies a world of actions and fictions alike. But the press is a daily action\nand fiction or thing made, and it is made out of just about everything in the\ncommunity. By the mosaic means, it is made into a communal image or cross-\nsection.\n\nWhen a conventional critic like Daniel Boorstin complains that modern ghost-\nwriting, teletype, and wire services create an insubstantial world of\n\"“pseudo-events,”\" he declares, in effect, that he has never examined the\nnature of any medium prior to those of the electric age. For the pseudo or\nfictitious character has always permeated the media, not just those of recent\norigin.\n\nLong before big business and corporations became aware of the image of their\noperation as a fiction to be carefully tattooed upon the public sensorium, the\npress had created the image of the community as a series of on-going actions\nunified by datelines. Apart from the vernacular used, the dateline is the only\norganizing principle of the newspaper image of the community. Take off the\ndateline, and one day’s paper is the same as the next. Yet to read a week-old\nnewspaper without noticing that it is not today’s is a disconcerting\nexperience. As soon as the press recognized that news presentation was not a\nrepetition of occurrences and reports but a direct cause of events, many\nthings began to happen. Advertising and promotion, until then restricted,\nbroke onto the front page, with the aid of Barnum, as sensational stories.\nToday’s press agent regards the newspaper as a ventriloquist does his dummy.\nHe can make it say what he wants. He looks on it as a painter does his palette\nand tubes of pigment; from the endless resources of available events, an\nendless variety of managed mosaic effects can be attained. Any private client\ncan be ensconced in a wide range of different patterns and tones of public\naffairs or human interest and depth items.\n\nIf we pay careful attention to the fact that the press is a mosaic,\nparticipant kind of organization and a do-it-yourself kind of world, we can\nsee why it is so necessary to democratic government. Throughout his study of\nthe press in The Fourth Branch of Government, Douglas Cater is baffled by the\nfact that amidst the extreme fragmentation of government departments and\nbranches, the press somehow manages to keep them in relation to each other and\nto the nation. He emphasizes the paradox that the press is dedicated to the\nprocess of cleansing by publicity, and yet that, in the electronic world of\nthe seamless web of events, most affairs must be kept secret. Top secrecy is\ntranslated into public participation and responsibility by the magic\nflexibility of the controlled news leak.\n\nIt is by this kind of ingenious adaptation from day to day that Western man is\nbeginning to accommodate himself to the electric world of total\ninterdependence. Nowhere is this transforming process of adaptation more\nvisible than in the press. The press, in itself, presents the contradiction of\nan individualistic technology dedicated to shaping and revealing group\nattitudes.\n\nIt might be well now to observe how the press has been modified by the recent\ndevelopments of telephone, radio, and TV. We have seen already that the\ntelegraph is the factor that has done most to create the mosaic image of the\nmodern press, with its mass of discontinuous and unconnected features. It is\nthis group-image of the communal life, rather than any editorial outlook or\nslanting, that constitutes the participant of this medium. To the book-man of\ndetached private culture, this is the scandal of the press: its shameless\ninvolvement in the depths of human interest and sentiment. By eliminating time\nand space in news presentation, the telegraph dimmed the privacy of the book-\nform, and heightened, instead, the new public image in the press.\n\nThe first harrowing experience for the press man visiting Moscow is the\nabsence of telephone books. A further horrifying revelation is the absence of\ncentral switchboards in government departments. You know the number, or else.\nThe student of media is happy to read a hundred volumes to discover two facts\nsuch as these. They floodlight a vast murky area of the pressworld, and\nilluminate the role of telephone as seen through another culture. The American\nnewspaperman in large degree assembles his stories and processes his data by\ntelephone because of the speed and immediacy of the oral process. Our popular\npress is a near approximation to the grapevine. The Russian and European\nnewspaperman is, by comparison, a littérateur. It is a paradoxical situation,\nbut the press in literate America has an intensely oral character, while in\noral Russia and Europe the press has a strongly literary character and\nfunction.\n\nThe English dislike the telephone so much that they substitute numerous mail\ndeliveries for it. The Russians use the telephone for a status symbol, like\nthe alarm clock worn by tribal chiefs as an article of attire in Africa. The\nmosaic of the press image in Russia is felt as an immediate form of tribal\nunity and participation. Those features of the press that we find most\ndiscordant with austere individual standards of literary culture are just the\nones that recommend it to the Communist Party. \"“A newspaper,”\" Lenin once\ndeclared, \"“is not only a collective propagandist and collective agitator; it\nis also a collective organizer.”\" Stalin called it \"“the most powerful weapon\nof our Party.”\" Khrushchev cites it as \"“our chief ideological weapon.”\" These\nmen had more an eye to the collective form of the press mosaic, with its\nmagical power to impose its own assumptions, than to the printed word as\nexpressing a private point of view. In oral Russia, fragmentation of\ngovernment powers is unknown. Not for them our function of the press as\nunifier of fragmented departments. The Russian monolith has quite different\nuses for the press mosaic. Russia now needs the press (as we formerly did the\nbook) to translate a tribal and oral community into some degree of visual,\nuniform culture able to sustain a market system.\n\nIn Egypt the press is needed to effect nationalism, that visual kind of unity\nthat springs men out of local and tribal patterns. Paradoxically, radio has\ncome to the fore in Egypt as the rejuvenator of the ancient tribes. The\nbattery radio carried on the camel gives to the Bedouin tribes a power and\nvitality unknown before, so that to use the word “nationalism” for the fury of\noral agitation that the Arabs have felt by radio is to conceal the situation\nfrom ourselves. Unity of the Arab-speaking world can only come by the press.\nNationalism was unknown to the Western world until the Renaissance, when\nGutenberg made it possible to _see_ the mother tongue in uniform dress. Radio\ndoes nothing for this uniform visual unity so necessary to nationalism. In\norder to restrict radio-listening to national programs, some Arab governments\nhave passed a law forbidding the use of private headphones, in effect\nenforcing a tribal collectivism in their radio audiences. Radio restores\ntribal sensitivity and exclusive involvement in the web of kinship. The press,\non the other hand, creates a visual, not-too-involved kind of unity that is\nhospitable to the inclusion of many tribes, and to diversity of private\noutlook.\n\nIf telegraph shortened the sentence, radio shortened the news story, and TV\ninjected the interrogative mood into journalism. In fact, the press is now not\nonly a telephoto mosaic of the human community hour by hour, but its\ntechnology is also a mosaic of all the technologies of the community. Even in\nits selection of the newsworthy, the press prefers those persons who have\nalready been accorded some notoriety existence in movies, radio, TV, and\ndrama. By this fact, we can test the nature of the press medium, for anybody\nwho appears only in the newspapers is, by that token, an ordinary citizen.\n\nWallpaper manufacturers have recently begun to issue wallpaper that presents\nthe appearance of a French newspaper. The Eskimo sticks magazine pages on the\nceiling of his igloo to deter drip. But even an ordinary newspaper on a\nkitchen floor will reveal news items that one had missed when the paper was in\nhand. Yet whether one uses the press for privacy in public conveyances, or for\ninvolvement in the communal while enjoying privacy, the mosaic of the press\nmanages to effect a complex many-leveled function of group-awareness and\nparticipation such as the book has never been able to perform.\n\nThe format of the press — that is, its structural characteristics — were quite\nnaturally taken over by the poets after Baudelaire in order to evoke an\ninclusive awareness. Our ordinary newspaper page today is not only symbolist\nand surrealist in an _avant-garde_ way, but it was the earlier _inspiration_\nof symbolism and surrealism in art and poetry, as anybody can discover by\nreading Flaubert or Rimbaud. Approached as newspaper form, any part of Joyce’s\nUlysses or any poem of T. S. Eliot’s before the Quartets is more readily\nenjoyed. Such, however, is the austere continuity of book culture that it\nscorns to notice these _liaisons dangéreuses_ among the media, especially the\nscandalous affairs of the book-page with electronic creatures from the other\nside of the linotype.\n\nIn view of the inveterate concern of the press with cleansing by publicity, it\nmay be well to ask if it does not set up an inevitable clash with the medium\nof the book. The press as a collective and communal image assumes a natural\nposture of opposition to all private manipulation. Any mere individual who\nbegins to stir about as if he were a public something-or-other is going to get\ninto the press. Any individual who manipulates the public for his private good\nmay also feel the cleansing power of publicity. The cloak of invisibility,\ntherefore, would seem to fall most naturally on those who own newspapers or\nwho use them extensively for commercial ends. May not this explain the strange\nobsession of the bookman with the press-lords as essentially corrupt? The\nmerely private and fragmentary point of view assumed by the book reader and\nwriter finds natural grounds for hostility toward the big communal power of\nthe press. As forms, as media, the book and the newspaper would seem to be as\nincompatible as any two media could be. The owners of media always endeavor to\ngive the public what it wants, because they sense that their power is in the\n_medium_ and not in the _message_ or the program.\n\n  *[BBC]: British Broadcasting Corporation\n  *[U.S.O.]: United Service Organizations\n\n\n![Motorcar: The Mechanical Bride](images/title-22.png)\n\nHere is a news item that captures a good deal of the meaning of the automobile\nin relation to social life:\n\n> I was terrific.

Some observers insist that, as a status\nsymbol, the house has, of late, supplanted the car. If so, this shift from the\nmobile open road to the manicured roots of suburbia may signify a real change\nin American orientation. There is a growing uneasiness about the degree to\nwhich cars have become the real population of our cities, with a resulting\nloss of human scale, both in power and in distance. The town planners are\nplotting ways and means to buy back our cities for the pedestrian from the big\ntransportation interests.\n\nLynn White tells the story of the stirrup and the heavy-armored knight in his\nMedieval Technology and Social Change. So expensive yet so mandatory was the\narmored rider for shock combat, that the cooperative feudal system came into\nexistence to pay for his equipment. Renaissance gunpowder and ordnance ended\nthe military role of the knight and returned the city to the pedestrian\nburgess.\n\nIf the motorist is technologically and economically far superior to the\narmored knight, it may be that electric changes in technology are about to\ndismount him and return us to the pedestrian scale. “Going to work” may be\nonly a transitory phase, like “going shopping.” The grocery interests have\nlong foreseen the possibility of shopping by two-way TV, or video-telephone.\nWilliam M. Freeman, writing for The New York Times Service (Tuesday, October\n15, 1963), reports that there will certainly be \"“a decided transition from\ntoday’s distribution vehicles … Mrs. Customer will be able to tune in on\nvarious stores. Her credit identification will be picked up automatically via\ntelevision. Items in full and faithful coloring will be viewed. Distance will\nhold no problem, since by the end of the century the consumer will be able to\nmake direct television connections regardless of how many miles are\ninvolved.”\"\n\nWhat is wrong with all such prophecies is that they assume a stable framework\nof fact — in this case, the house and the store — which is usually the first\nto disappear. The changing relation between customer and shopkeeper is as\nnothing compared to the changing pattern of work itself, in an age of\nautomation. It is true that going-to and coming-from work are almost certain\nto lose all of their present character. The car as vehicle, in that sense,\nwill go the way of the horse. The horse has lost its role in transportation\nbut has made a strong comeback in entertainment. So with the motorcar. Its\nfuture does not belong in the area of transportation. Had the infant\nautomotive industry, in 1910, seen fit to call a conference to consider the\nfuture of the horse, the discussion would have been concerned to discover new\njobs for the horse and new kinds of training to extend the usefulness of the\nhorse. The complete revolution in transportation and in housing and city\narrangement would have been ignored. The turn of our economy to making and\nservicing motorcars, and the devotion of much leisure time to their use on a\nvast new highway system, would not even have been thought of. In other words,\nit is the framework itself that changes with new technology, and not just the\npicture within the frame. Instead of thinking of doing our shopping by\ntelevision, we should become aware that TV intercom means the end of shopping\nitself, and the end of work as we know it at present. The same fallacy besets\nour thinking about TV and education. We think of TV as an incidental aid,\nwhereas in fact it has already transformed the learning process of the young,\nquite independently of home and school alike.\n\nIn the 1930s, when millions of comic books were inundating the young with\ngore, nobody seemed to notice that emotionally the violence of millions of\ncars in our streets was incomparably more hysterical than anything that could\never be printed. All the rhinos and hippos and elephants in the world, if\ngathered in one city, could not begin to create the menace and explosive\nintensity of the hourly and daily experience of the internal-combustion\nengine. Are people really expected to internalize — live with — all this power\nand explosive violence, without processing and siphoning it off into some form\nof fantasy for compensation and balance?\n\nIn the silent pictures of the 1920s a great many of the sequences involved the\nmotorcar and policemen. Since the film was then accepted as an optical\nillusion, the cop was the principal reminder of the existence of ground rules\nin the game of fantasy. As such, he took an endless beating. The motorcars of\nthe 1920s look to our eyes like ingenious contraptions hastily assembled in a\ntool shop. Their link with the buggy was still strong and clear. Then came the\nballoon tires, the massive interior, and the bulging fenders. Some people see\nthe big car as a sort of bloated middle age, following the gawky period of the\nfirst love-affair between America and the car. But funny as the Viennese\nanalysts have been able to get about the car as sex object, they have at last,\nin doing so, drawn attention to the fact that, like the bees in the plant\nworld, men have always been the sex organs of the technological world. The car\nis no more and no less a sex object than the wheel or the hammer. What the\nmotivation researchers have missed entirely is the fact that the American\nsense of spatial form has changed much since radio, and drastically since TV.\nIt is misleading, though harmless, to try to grasp this change as middle-age\nreaching out for the sylph Lolita.\n\nCertainly there have been some strenuous slimming programs for the car in\nrecent years. But if one were to ask, “Will the car last?” or “Is the motorcar\nhere to stay?” there would be confusion and doubt at once. Strangely, in so\nprogressive an age, when change has become the only constant in our lives, we\nnever ask, “Is the car here to stay?” The answer, of course, is “No.” In the\nelectric age, the wheel itself is obsolescent. At the heart of the car\nindustry there are men who know that the car is passing, as certainly as the\ncuspidor was doomed when the lady typist arrived on the business scene. What\narrangements have they made to ease the automobile industry off the center of\nthe stage? The mere obsolescence of the wheel does not mean its disappearance.\nIt means only that, like penmanship or typography, the wheel will move into a\nsubsidiary role in the culture.\n\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century great success was achieved with steam-\nengined cars on the open road. Only the heavy toll-taxes levied by local road\nauthorities discouraged steam engines on the highways. Pneumatic tires were\nfitted to a steam car in France in 1887. The American Stanley Steamer began to\nflourish in 1899. Ford had already built his first car in 1896, and the Ford\nMotor Company was founded in 1903. It was the electric spark that enabled the\ngasoline engine to take over from the steam engine. The crossing of\nelectricity, the biological form, with the mechanical form was never to\nrelease a greater force.\n\nIt is TV that has dealt the heavy blow to the American car. The car and the\nassembly line had become the ultimate expression of Gutenberg technology; that\nis, of uniform and repeatable processes applied to all aspects of work and\nliving. TV brought a questioning of all mechanical assumptions about\nuniformity and standardization, as of all consumer values. TV brought also\nobsession with depth study and analysis. Motivation research, offering to hook\nthe ad and the _id_ , became immediately acceptable to the frantic executive\nworld that felt the same way about the new American tastes as Al Capp did\nabout his 50,000,000 audience when TV struck. Something had happened. America\nwas not the same.\n\nFor forty years the car had been the great leveler of physical space and of\nsocial distance as well. The talk about the American car as a status symbol\nhas always overlooked the basic fact that it is the _power_ of the motorcar\nthat levels all social differences, and makes the pedestrian a second-class\ncitizen. Many people have observed how the real integrator or leveler of white\nand Negro in the South was the private car and the truck, not the expression\nof moral points of view. The simple and obvious fact about the car is that,\nmore than any horse, it is an extension of man that turns the rider into a\nsuperman. It is a hot, explosive medium of social communication. And TV, by\ncooling off the American public tastes and creating new needs for unique wrap-\naround space, which the European car promptly provided, practically unhorsed\nthe American auto-cavalier. The small European cars reduce him to near-\npedestrian status once more. Some people manage to drive them on the sidewalk.\n\nThe car did its social leveling by horsepower alone. In turn, the car created\nhighways and resorts that were not only very much alike in all parts of the\nland, but equally available to all. Since TV, there is naturally frequent\ncomplaint about this uniformity of vehicle and vacation scene. As John Keats\nput it in his attack on the car and the industry in The Insolent Chariots,\nwhere one automobile can go, all other automobiles do go, and wherever the\nautomobile goes, the automobile version of civilization surely follows. Now\nthis is a TV-oriented sentiment that is not only anti-car and anti-\nstandardization, but anti-Gutenberg, and therefore anti-American as well. Of\ncourse, I know that John Keats doesn’t _mean_ this. He had never thought about\nmedia or the way in which Gutenberg created Henry Ford and the assembly line\nand standardized culture. All he knew was that it was popular to decry the\nuniform, the standardized, and the hot forms of communication, in general. For\nthat reason, Vance Packard could make hay with The Hidden Persuaders. He\nhooted at the old salesmen and the hot media, just as MAD does. Before TV,\nsuch gestures would have been meaningless. It wouldn’t have paid off. Now, it\npays to laugh at the mechanical and the merely standardized. John Keats could\nquestion the central glory of classless American society by saying, \"“If\nyou’ve seen one part of America, you’ve seen it all,”\" and that the car gave\nthe American the opportunity, not to travel and experience adventure, but \"“to\nmake himself more and more common.”\" Since TV, it has become popular to regard\nthe more and more uniform and repeatable products of industry with the same\ncontempt that a Brahmin like Henry James might have felt for a chamber-pot\ndynasty in 1890. It is true that automation is about to produce the unique and\ncustom-built at assembly-line speed and cheapness. Automation can manage the\nbespoke car or coat with less fuss than we ever produced the standardized\nones. But the unique product cannot circulate in our market or distribution\nsetups. As a result, we are moving into a most revolutionary period in\nmarketing, as in everything else.\n\nWhen Europeans used to visit America before the Second War they would say,\n\"“But you have communism here!”\" What they meant was that we not only _had_\nstandardized goods, but _everybody_ had them. Our millionaires not only ate\ncornflakes and hot dogs, but really thought of themselves as middle-class\npeople. What else? How could a millionaire be anything but “middle-class” in\nAmerica unless he had the creative imagination of an artist to make a unique\nlife for himself? Is it strange that Europeans should associate uniformity of\nenvironment and commodities with communism? And that Lloyd Warner and his\nassociates, in their studies of American cities, should speak of the American\nclass system in terms of income? The highest income cannot liberate a North\nAmerican from his “middle-class” life. The lowest income gives everybody a\nconsiderable piece of the same middle-class existence. That is, we really have\nhomogenized our schools and factories and cities and entertainment to a great\nextent, just because we are literate and do accept the logic of uniformity and\nhomogeneity that is inherent in Gutenberg technology. This logic, which had\nnever been accepted in Europe until very recently, has suddenly been\nquestioned in America, since the tactile mesh of the TV mosaic has begun to\npermeate the American sensorium. When a popular writer can, with confidence,\ndecry the use of the car for travel as making the driver \"“more and more\ncommon,”\" the fabric of American life has been questioned.\n\nOnly a few years back Cadillac announced its “El Dorado Brougham” as having\nanti-dive control, outriggers, pillarless styling, projectile-shaped gull-wing\nbumpers, outboard exhaust ports, and various other exotic features borrowed\nfrom the non-motorcar world. We were invited to associate it with Hawaiian\nsurf riders, with gulls soaring like sixteen-inch shells, and with the boudoir\nof Madame de Pompadour. Could MAD magazine do any better? In the TV age, any\nof these tales from the Vienna woods, dreamed up by motivational researchers,\ncould be relied upon to be an ideal comic script for MAD. The script was\nalways there, in fact, but not till TV was the audience conditioned to enjoy\nit.\n\nTo mistake the car for a status symbol, just because it is asked to be taken\nas anything but a car, is to mistake the whole meaning of this very late\nproduct of the mechanical age that is now yielding its form to electric\ntechnology. The car is a superb piece of uniform, standardized mechanism that\nis of a piece with the Gutenberg technology and literacy which created the\nfirst classless society in the world. The car gave to the democratic cavalier\nhis horse and armor and haughty insolence in one package, transmogrifying the\nknight into a misguided missile. In fact, the American car did not level\ndownward, but upward, toward the aristocratic idea. Enormous increase and\ndistribution of power had also been the equalizing force of literacy and\nvarious other forms of mechanization. The willingness to accept the car as a\nstatus symbol, restricting its more expansive form to the use of higher\nexecutives, is not a mark of the car and mechanical age, but of the electric\nforces that are now ending this mechanical age of uniformity and\nstandardization, and recreating the norms of status and role.\n\nWhen the motorcar was new, it exercised the typical mechanical pressure of\nexplosion and separation of functions. It broke up family life, or so it\nseemed, in the 1920s. It separated work and domicile, as never before. It\nexploded each city into a dozen suburbs, and then extended many of the forms\nof urban life along the highways until the open road seemed to become non-stop\ncities. It created the asphalt jungles, and caused 40,000 square miles of\ngreen and pleasant land to be cemented over. With the arrival of plane travel,\nthe motorcar and truck teamed up together to wreck the railways. Today small\nchildren plead for a train ride as if it were a stagecoach or horse and\ncutter: \"“Before they’re _gone_ , Daddy.”\"\n\nThe motorcar ended the countryside and substituted a new landscape in which\nthe car was a sort of steeplechaser. At the same time, the motor destroyed the\ncity as a casual environment in which families could be reared. Streets, and\neven sidewalks, became too intense a scene for the casual interplay of growing\nup. As the city filled with mobile strangers, even next door neighbors became\nstrangers. This is the story of the motorcar, and it has not much longer to\nrun. The tide of taste and tolerance has turned, since TV, to make the hot-car\nmedium increasingly tiresome. Witness the portent of the crosswalk, where the\nsmall child has power to stop a cement truck. The same change has rendered the\nbig city unbearable to many who would no more have felt that way ten years ago\nthan they could have enjoyed reading MAD.\n\nThe continuing power of the car medium to transform the patterns of settlement\nappears fully in the way in which the new urban kitchen has taken on the same\ncentral and multiple social character as the old farm kitchen. The farm\nkitchen had been the key point of entry to the farmhouse, and had become the\nsocial center, as well. The new suburban home again makes the kitchen the\ncenter and, ideally, is localized for access to and from the car. The car has\nbecome the carapace, the protective and aggressive shell, of urban and\nsuburban man. Even before the Volkswagen, observers above street level have\noften noticed the near-resemblance of cars to shiny-backed insects. In the age\nof the tactile-oriented skin-diver, this hard shiny carapace is one of the\nblackest marks against the motorcar. It is for motorized man that the shopping\nplazas have emerged. They are strange islands that make the pedestrian feel\nfriendless and disembodied. The car bugs him.\n\nThe car, in a word, has quite refashioned all of the spaces that unite and\nseparate men, and it will continue to do so for a decade more, by which time\nthe electronic successors to the car will be manifest.\n\n\n![Ads: Keeping Upset with the Joneses](images/title-23.png)\n\nThe continuous pressure is to create ads more and more in the image of\naudience motives and desires. The product matters less as the audience\nparticipation increases. An extreme example is the corset series that protests\nthat \"“it is not the corset that you feel.”\" The need is to make the ad\ninclude the audience experience. The product and the public response become a\nsingle complex pattern. The art of advertising has wondrously come to fulfill\nthe early definition of anthropology as \"“the science of man embracing\nwoman.”\" The steady trend in advertising is to manifest the product as an\nintegral part of large social purposes and processes. With very large budgets\nthe commercial artists have tended to develop the ad into an icon, and icons\nare not specialist fragments or aspects but unified and compressed images of\ncomplex kind. They focus a large region of experience in tiny compass. The\ntrend in ads, then, is away from the consumer picture of product to the\nproducer image of process. The corporate image of process includes the\nconsumer in the producer role as well.\n\nThis powerful new trend in ads toward the iconic image has greatly weakened\nthe position of the magazine industry in general and the picture magazines in\nparticular. Magazine features have long employed the pictorial treatment of\nthemes and news. Side by side with these magazine features that present shots\nand fragmentary points of view, there are the new massive iconic ads with\ntheir compressed images that include producer and consumer, seller and society\nin a single image. The ads make the features seem pale, weak, and anemic. The\nfeatures belong to the old pictorial world that preceded TV mosaic imagery.\n\nIt is the powerful mosaic and iconic thrust in our experience since TV that\nexplains the paradox of the upsurge of Time and Newsweek and similar\nmagazines. These magazines present the news in a compressed mosaic form that\nis a real parallel to the ad world. Mosaic news is neither narrative, nor\npoint of view, nor explanation, nor comment. It is a corporate image in depth\nof the community in action and invites maximal participation in the social\nprocess.\n\nAds seem to work on the very advanced principle that a small pellet or pattern\nin a noisy, redundant barrage of repetition will gradually assert itself. Ads\npush the principle of noise all the way to the plateau of persuasion. They are\nquite in accord with the procedures of brain-washing. This depth principle of\nonslaught on the unconscious may be the reason why.\n\nMany people have expressed uneasiness about the advertising enterprise in our\ntime. To put the matter abruptly, the advertising industry is a crude attempt\nto extend the principles of automation to every aspect of society. Ideally,\nadvertising aims at the goal of a programmed harmony among all human impulses\nand aspirations and endeavors. Using handicraft methods, it stretches out\ntoward the ultimate electronic goal of a collective consciousness. When all\nproduction and all consumption are brought into a pre-established harmony with\nall desire and all effort, then advertising will have liquidated itself by its\nown success.\n\nSince the advent of TV, the exploitation of the unconscious by the advertiser\nhas hit a snag. TV experience favors much more consciousness concerning the\nunconscious than do the hard-sell forms of presentation in the press, the\nmagazine, movie, or radio. The sensory tolerance of the audience has changed,\nand so have the methods of appeal by the advertisers. In the new cool TV\nworld, the old hot world of hard-selling, earnest-talking salesmen has all the\nantique charm of the songs and togs of the 1920s. Mort Sahl and Shelley Berman\nare merely following, not setting, a trend in spoofing the ad world. They\ndiscovered that they have only to reel off an ad or news item to have the\naudience in fits. Will Rogers discovered years ago that any newspaper read\naloud from a theater stage is hilarious. The same is true today of ads. Any ad\nput into a new setting is funny. This is a way of saying that any ad\nconsciously attended to is comical. Ads are not meant for conscious\nconsumption. They are intended as subliminal pills for the subconscious in\norder to exercise an hypnotic spell, especially on sociologists. That is one\nof the most edifying aspects of the huge educational enterprise that we call\nadvertising, whose twelve-billion-dollar annual budget approximates the\nnational school budget. Any expensive ad represents the toil, attention,\ntesting, wit, art, and skill of many people. Far more thought and care go into\nthe composition of any prominent ad in a newspaper or magazine than go into\nthe writing of their features and editorials. Any expensive ad is as carefully\nbuilt on the tested foundations of public stereotypes or “sets” of established\nattitudes, as any skyscraper is built on bedrock. Since highly skilled and\nperceptive teams of talent cooperate in the making of an ad for any\nestablished line of goods whatever, it is obvious that any acceptable ad is a\nvigorous dramatization of communal experience. No group of sociologists can\napproximate the ad teams in the gathering and processing of exploitable social\ndata. The ad teams have billions to spend annually on research and testing of\nreactions, and their products are magnificent accumulations of material about\nthe shared experience and feelings of the entire community. Of course, if ads\nwere to depart from the center of this shared experience, they would collapse\nat once, by losing all hold on our feelings.\n\nIt is true, of course, that ads use the most basic and tested human experience\nof a community in grotesque ways. They are as incongruous, if looked at\nconsciously, as the playing of “Silver Threads among the Gold” as music for a\nstrip-tease act. But ads are carefully designed by the Madison Avenue frog-\nmen-of-the-mind for semiconscious exposure. Their mere existence is a\ntestimony, as well as a contribution, to the somnambulistic state of a tired\nmetropolis.\n\nAfter the Second War, an ad-conscious American army officer in Italy noted\nwith misgiving that Italians could tell you the names of cabinet ministers,\nbut not the names of commodities preferred by Italian celebrities.\nFurthermore, he said, the wall space of Italian cities was given over to\npolitical, rather than commercial, slogans. He predicted that there was small\nhope that Italians would ever achieve any sort of domestic prosperity or calm\nuntil they began to worry about the rival claims of cornflakes and cigarettes,\nrather than the capacities of public men. In fact, he went so far as to say\nthat democratic freedom very largely consists in ignoring politics and\nworrying, instead, about the threat of scaly scalp, hairy legs, sluggish\nbowels, saggy breasts, receding gums, excess weight, and tired blood.\n\nThe army officer was probably right. Any community that wants to expedite and\nmaximize the exchange of goods and services has simply got to homogenize its\nsocial life. The decision to homogenize comes easily to the highly literate\npopulation of the English-speaking world. Yet it is hard for oral cultures to\nagree on this program of homogenization, for they are only too prone to\ntranslate the message of radio into tribal politics, rather than into a new\nmeans of pushing Cadillacs. This is one reason that it was easy for the\nretribalized Nazi to feel superior to the American consumer. The tribal man\ncan spot the gaps in the literate mentality very easily. On the other hand, it\nis the special illusion of literate societies that they are highly aware and\nindividualistic. Centuries of typographic conditioning in patterns of lineal\nuniformity and fragmented repeatability have, in the electric age, been given\nincreasing critical attention by the artistic world. The lineal process has\nbeen pushed out of industry, not only in management and production, but in\nentertainment, as well. It is the new mosaic form of the TV image that has\nreplaced the Gutenberg structural assumptions. Reviewers of William Burroughs’\nThe Naked Lunch have alluded to the prominent use of the “mosaic” term and\nmethod in his novel. The TV image renders the world of standard brands and\nconsumer goods merely amusing. Basically, the reason is that the mosaic mesh\nof the TV image compels so much active participation on the part of the viewer\nthat he develops a nostalgia for pre-consumer ways and days. Lewis Mumford\ngets serious attention when he praises the cohesive form of medieval towns as\nrelevant to our time and needs.\n\nAdvertising got into high gear only at the end of the last century, with the\ninvention of photoengraving. Ads and pictures then became interchangeable and\nhave continued so. More important, pictures made possible great increases in\nnewspaper and magazine circulation that also increased the quantity and\nprofitability of ads. Today it is inconceivable that any publication, daily or\nperiodical, could hold more than a few thousand readers without pictures. For\nboth the pictorial ad or the picture story provide large quantities of instant\ninformation and instant humans, such as are necessary for keeping abreast in\nour kind of culture. Would it not seem natural and necessary that the young be\nprovided with at least as much training of perception in this graphic and\nphotographic world as they get in the typographic? In fact, they need more\ntraining in graphics, because the art of casting and arranging actors in ads\nis both complex and forcefully insidious.\n\nSome writers have argued that the Graphic Revolution has shifted our culture\naway from private ideals to corporate images. That is really to say that the\nphoto and TV seduce us from the _literate_ and private “point of view” to the\ncomplex and inclusive world of the group icon. That is certainly what\nadvertising does. Instead of presenting a private argument or vista, it offers\na way of life that is for everybody or nobody. It offers this prospect with\narguments that concern only irrelevant and trivial matters. For example, a\nlush car ad features a baby’s rattle on the rich rug of the back floor and\nsays that it has removed unwanted car rattles as easily as the user could\nremove the baby’s rattle. This kind of copy has really nothing to do with\nrattles. The copy is merely a punning gag to distract the critical faculties\nwhile the image of the car goes to work on the hypnotized viewer. Those who\nhave spent their lives protesting about “false and misleading ad copy” are\ngodsends to advertisers, as teetotalers are to brewers, and moral censors are\nto books and films. The protesters are the best acclaimers and accelerators.\nSince the advent of pictures, the job of the ad copy is as incidental and\nlatent as the “meaning” of a poem is to a poem, or the words of a song are to\na song. Highly literate people cannot cope with the nonverbal art of the\npictorial, so they dance impatiently up and down to express a pointless\ndisapproval that renders them futile and gives new power and authority to the\nads. The unconscious depth-messages of ads are never attacked by the literate,\nbecause of their incapacity to notice or discuss nonverbal forms of\narrangement and meaning. They have not the art to argue with pictures. When\nearly in TV broadcasting hidden ads were tried out, the literate were in a\ngreat panic until they were dropped. The fact that typography is itself mainly\nsubliminal in effect and that pictures are, as well, is a secret that is safe\nfrom the book-oriented community.\n\nWhen the movies came, the entire pattern of American life went on the screen\nas a nonstop ad. Whatever any actor or actress wore or used or ate was such an\nad as had never been dreamed of. The American bathroom, kitchen, and car, like\neverything else, got the Arabian Nights treatment. The result was that all ads\nin magazines and the press had to look like scenes from a movie. They still\ndo. But the focus has had to become softer since TV.\n\nWith radio, ads openly went over to the incantation of the singing commercial.\nNoise and nausea as a technique of achieving unforgetability became universal.\nAd and image making became, and have remained, the one really dynamic and\ngrowing part of the economy. Both movie and radio are hot media, whose arrival\npepped up everybody to a great degree, giving us the Roaring Twenties. The\neffect was to provide a massive platform and a mandate for sales promotion as\na way of life that ended only with The Death of A Salesman and the advent of\nTV. These two events did not coincide by accident. TV introduced that\n“experience in depth” and the “do-it-yourself” pattern of living that has\nshattered the image of the individualist hard-sell salesman and the docile\nconsumer, just as it has blurred the formerly clear figures of the movie\nstars. This is not to suggest that Arthur Miller was trying to explain TV to\nAmerica on the eve of its arrival, though he could as appropriately have\ntitled his play “The Birth of the PR Man.” Those who saw Harold Lloyd’s World\nof Comedy film will remember their surprise at how much of the 1920s they had\nforgotten. Also, they were surprised to find evidence of how naïve and simple\nthe Twenties really were. That age of the vamps, the sheiks, and the cavemen\nwas a raucous nursery compared to our world, in which children read MAD\nmagazine for chuckles. It was a world still innocently engaged in expanding\nand exploding, in separating and teasing and tearing. Today, with TV, we are\nexperiencing the opposite process of integrating and interrelating that is\nanything but innocent. The simple faith of the salesman in the irresistibility\nof his line (both talk and goods) now yields to the complex togetherness of\nthe corporate posture, the process and the organization.\n\nAds have proved to be a self-liquidating form of community entertainment. They\ncame along just after the Victorian gospel of work, and they promised a Beulah\nland of perfectibility, where it would be possible to \"“iron shirts without\nhating your husband.”\" And now they are deserting the individual consumer-\nproduct in favor of the all-inclusive and never-ending process that is the\nImage of any great corporate enterprise. The Container Corporation of America\ndoes not feature paper bags and paper cups in its ads, but the container\n_function_ , by means of great art. The historians and archeologists will one\nday discover that the ads of our times are the richest and most faithful daily\nreflections that any society ever made of its entire range of activities. The\nEgyptian hieroglyph lags far behind in this respect. With TV, the smarter\nadvertisers have made free with fur and fuzz, and blur and buzz. They have, in\na word, taken a skin-dive. For that is what the TV viewer is. He is a skin-\ndiver, and he no longer likes garish daylight on hard, shiny surfaces, though\nhe must continue to put up with a noisy radio sound track that is painful.\n\n\n![Games: The Extensions of Man](images/title-24.png)\n\nAlcohol and gambling have very different meanings in different cultures. In\nour intensely individualist and fragmented Western world, “booze” is a social\nbond and a means of festive involvement. By contrast, in closely knit tribal\nsociety, “booze” is destructive of all social pattern and is even used as a\nmeans to mystical experience.\n\nIn tribal societies, gambling, on the other hand, is a welcome avenue of\nentrepreneurial effort and individual initiative. Carried into an\nindividualist society, the same gambling games and sweepstakes seem to\nthreaten the whole social order. Gambling pushes individual initiative to the\npoint of mocking the individualist social structure. The tribal virtue is the\ncapitalist vice.\n\nWhen the boys came home from the mud and blood baths of the Western Front in\n1918 and 1919, they encountered the Volstead Prohibition Act. It was the\nsocial and political recognition that the war had fraternalized and tribalized\nus to the point where alcohol was a threat to an individualist society. When\nwe too are prepared to legalize gambling, we shall, like the English, announce\nto the world the end of individualist society and the trek back to tribal\nways.\n\nWe think of humor as a mark of sanity for a good reason: in fun and play we\nrecover the integral person, who in the workaday world or in professional life\ncan use only a small sector of his being. Philip Deane, in Captive in Korea,\ntells a story about games in the midst of successive brainwashings that is to\nthe point.\n\n> There came a time when I had to stop reading those books, to stop practising\n> Russian because with the study of language the absurd and constant assertion\n> began to leave its mark, began to find an echo, and I felt my thinking\n> processes getting tangled, my critical faculties getting blunted … then they\n> made a mistake. They gave us Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island in\n> English … I could read Marx again, and question myself honestly without\n> fear. Robert Louis Stevenson made us lighthearted, so we started dancing\n> lessons.\n\nGames are popular art, collective, social reactions to the main drive or\naction of any culture. Games, like institutions, are extensions of social man\nand of the body politic, as technologies are extensions of the animal\norganism. Both games and technologies are counter-irritants or ways of\nadjusting to the stress of the specialized actions that occur in any social\ngroup. As extensions of the popular response to the workaday stress, games\nbecome faithful models of a culture. They incorporate both the action and the\nreaction of whole populations in a single dynamic image.\n\nA Reuters dispatch for December 13, 1962, reported from Tokyo:\n\n> ## Business Is A Battlefield\n>\n> Latest fashion among Japanese businessmen is the study of classical military\n> strategy and tactics in order to apply them to business operations … It has\n> been reported that one of the largest advertising companies in Japan has\n> even made these books compulsory reading for all its employees.\n\nLong centuries of tight tribal organization now stand the Japanese in very\ngood stead in the trade and commerce of the electric age. A few decades ago\nthey underwent enough literacy and industrial fragmentation to release\naggressive individual energies. The close teamwork and tribal loyalty now\ndemanded by electrical intercom again puts the Japanese in positive relation\nto their ancient traditions. Our own tribal ways are much too remote to be of\nany social avail. We have begun retribalizing with the same painful groping\nwith which a preliterate society begins to read and write, and to organize its\nlife visually in three-dimensional space.\n\nThe search for Michael Rockefeller brought the life of a New Guinea tribe into\nprominent attention in Life a year ago. The editors explained the war games of\nthese people:\n\n> The traditional enemies of the Willigiman-Wallalua are the Wittaia, a people\n> exactly like themselves in language, dress and custom … Every week or two\n> the Willigiman-Wallalua and their enemies arrange a formal battle at one of\n> the traditional fighting grounds. In comparison with the catastrophic\n> conflicts of “civilized” nations, these frays seem more like a dangerous\n> field sport than true war. Each battle lasts but a single day, always stops\n> before nightfall (because of the danger of ghosts) or if it begins to rain\n> (no one wants to get his hair or ornaments wet). The men are very accurate\n> with their weapons — they have all played war games since they were small\n> boys — but they are equally adept at dodging, and hence are rarely hit by\n> anything.\n>\n> The truly lethal part of this primitive warfare is not the formal battle but\n> the sneak raid or stealthy ambush in which not only men but women and\n> children are mercilessly slaughtered.…\n>\n> This perpetual bloodshed is carried on for none of the usual reasons for\n> waging war. No territory is won or lost; no goods or prisoners are seized …\n> They fight because they enthusiastically enjoy it, because it is to them a\n> vital function of the complete man, and because they feel they must satisfy\n> the ghosts of slain companions.\n\nThese people, in short, detect in these games a kind of model of the universe,\nin whose deadly gavotte they can participate through the ritual of war games.\n\nGames are dramatic models of our psychological lives providing release of\nparticular tensions. They are collective and popular art forms with strict\nconventions. Ancient and non-literate societies naturally regarded games as\nlive dramatic models of the universe or of the outer cosmic drama. The Olympic\ngames were direct enactments of the _agon_ , or struggle of the Sun god. The\nrunners moved around a track adorned with the zodiacal signs in imitation of\nthe daily circuit of the sun chariot. With games and plays that were dramatic\nenactments of a cosmic struggle, the spectator role was plainly religious. The\nparticipation in these rituals kept the cosmos on the right track, as well as\nproviding a booster shot for the tribe. The tribe or the city was a dim\nreplica of that cosmos, as much as were the games, the dances, and the icons.\nHow art became a sort of civilized substitute for magical games and rituals is\nthe story of the detribalization which came with literacy. Art, like games,\nbecame a mimetic echo of, and relief from, the old magic of total involvement.\nAs the audience for the magic games and plays became more individualistic, the\nrole of art and ritual shifted from the cosmic to the humanly psychological,\nas in Greek drama. Even the ritual became more verbal and less mimetic or\ndancelike. Finally, the verbal narrative from Homer and Ovid became a romantic\nliterary substitute for the corporate liturgy and group participation. Much of\nthe scholarly effort of the past century in many fields has been devoted to a\nminute reconstruction of the conditions of primitive art and ritual, for it\nhas been felt that this course offers the key to understanding the mind of\nprimitive man. The key to this understanding, however, is also available in\nour new electric technology that is so swiftly and profoundly re-creating the\nconditions and attitudes of primitive tribal man in ourselves.\n\nThe wide appeal of the games of recent times — the popular sports of baseball\nand football and ice hockey — seen as outer models of inner psychological\nlife, become understandable. As models, they are collective rather than\nprivate dramatizations of inner life. Like our vernacular tongues, all games\nare media of interpersonal communication, and they could have neither\nexistence nor meaning except as extensions of our immediate inner lives. If we\ntake a tennis racket in hand, or thirteen playing cards, we consent to being a\npart of a dynamic mechanism in an artificially contrived situation. Is this\nnot the reason we enjoy those games most that mimic other situations in our\nwork and social lives? Do not our favorite games provide a release from the\nmonopolistic tyranny of the social machine? In a word, does not Aristotle’s\nidea of drama as a mimetic reenactment and relief from our besetting pressures\napply perfectly to all kinds of games and dance and fun? For fun or games to\nbe welcome, they must convey an echo of workaday life. On the other hand, a\nman or society without games is one sunk in the zombie trance of the\nautomaton. Art and games enable us to stand aside from the material pressures\nof routine and convention, observing and questioning. Games as popular art\nforms offer to all an immediate means of participation in the full life of a\nsociety, such as no single role or job can offer to any man. Hence the\ncontradiction in “professional” sport. When the games door opening into the\nfree life leads into a merely specialist job, everybody senses an incongruity.\n\nThe games of a people reveal a great deal about them. Games are a sort of\nartificial paradise like Disneyland, or some Utopian vision by which we\ninterpret and complete the meaning of our daily lives. In games we devise\nmeans of non-specialized participation in the larger drama of our time. But\nfor civilized man the idea of participation is strictly limited. Not for him\nthe depth participation that erases the boundaries of individual awareness as\nin the Indian cult of _darshan_ , the mystic experience of the physical\npresence of vast numbers of people.\n\nA game is a machine that can get into action only if the players consent to\nbecome puppets for a time. For individualist Western man, much of his\n“adjustment” to society has the character of a personal surrender to the\ncollective demands. Our games help both to teach us this kind of adjustment\nand also to provide a release from it. The uncertainty of the outcomes of our\ncontests makes a rational excuse for the mechanical rigor of the rules and\nprocedures of the game.\n\nWhen the social rules change suddenly, then previously accepted social manners\nand rituals may suddenly assume the stark outlines and the arbitrary patterns\nof a game. The Gamesmanship of Stephen Potter speaks of a social revolution in\nEngland. The English are moving toward social equality and the intense\npersonal competition that goes with equality. The older rituals of long-\naccepted class behavior now begin to appear comic and irrational, gimmicks in\na game. Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People first appeared\nas a solemn manual of social wisdom, but it seemed quite ludicrous to\nsophisticates. What Carnegie offered as serious discoveries already seemed\nlike a naïve mechanical ritual to those beginning to move in a milieu of\nFreudian awareness charged with the psychopathology of everyday life. Already\nthe Freudian patterns of perception have become an outworn code that begins to\nprovide the cathartic amusement of a game, rather than a guide to living.\n\nThe social practices of one generation tend to get codified into the “game” of\nthe next. Finally, the game is passed on as a joke, like a skeleton stripped\nof its flesh. This is especially true of periods of suddenly altered\nattitudes, resulting from some radically new technology. It is the inclusive\nmesh of the TV image, in particular, that spells for a while, at least, the\ndoom of baseball. For baseball is a game of one-thing-at-a-time, fixed\npositions and visibly delegated specialist jobs such as belonged to the now\npassing mechanical age, with its fragmented tasks and its staff and line in\nmanagement organization. TV, as the very image of the new corporate and\nparticipant ways of electric living, fosters habits of unified awareness and\nsocial interdependence that alienate us from the peculiar style of baseball,\nwith its specialist and positional stress. When cultures change, so do games.\nBaseball, that had become the elegant abstract image of an industrial society\nliving by split-second timing, has in the new TV decade lost its psychic and\nsocial relevance for our new way of life. The ball game has been dislodged\nfrom the social center and been conveyed to the periphery of American life.\n\nIn contrast, American football is nonpositional, and any or all of the players\ncan switch to any role during play. It is, therefore, a game that at the\npresent is supplanting baseball in general acceptance. It agrees very well\nwith the new needs of decentralized team play in the electric age. Offhand, it\nmight be supposed that the tight tribal unity of football would make it a game\nthat the Russians would cultivate. Their devotion to ice hockey and soccer,\ntwo very individualist forms of game, would seem little suited to the psychic\nneeds of a collectivist society. But Russia is still in the main an oral,\ntribal world that is undergoing detribalization and just now discovering\nindividualism as a novelty. Soccer and ice hockey have for them, therefore, an\nexotic and Utopian quality of promise that they do not convey to the West.\nThis is the quality that we tend to call “snob value,” and _we_ might derive\nsome similar “value” from owning race horses, polo ponies, or twelve-meter\nyachts.\n\nGames, therefore, can provide many varieties of satisfaction. Here we are\nlooking at their role as media of communication in society as a whole. Thus,\npoker is a game that has often been cited as the expression of all the complex\nattitudes and unspoken values of a competitive society. It calls for\nshrewdness, aggression, trickery, and unflattering appraisals of character. It\nis said women cannot play poker well because it stimulates their curiosity,\nand curiosity is fatal in poker. Poker is intensely individualist, allowing no\nplace for kindness or consideration, but only for the greatest good of the\ngreatest number—the number one. It is in this perspective that it is easy to\nsee why war has been called the sport of kings. For kingdoms are to monarchs\nwhat patrimonies and private income are to the private citizen. Kings can play\npoker with kingdoms, as the generals of their armies do with the troops. They\ncan bluff and deceive the opponent about their resources and their intentions.\nWhat disqualifies war from being a true game is probably what also\ndisqualifies the stock market and business — the rules are not fully known nor\naccepted by all the players. Furthermore, the audience is too fully\nparticipant in war and business, just as in a native society there is no true\nart because _everybody_ is engaged in making art. Art and games need rules,\nconventions, and spectators. They must stand forth from the over-all situation\nas models of it in order for the quality of play to persist. For “play,”\nwhether in life or in a wheel, implies _interplay_. There must be give and\ntake, or dialogue, as between two or more persons and groups. This quality\ncan, however, be diminished or lost in any kind of situation. Great teams\noften play practice games without any audience at all. This is not sport in\nour sense, because much of the quality of interplay, the very medium of\ninterplay, as it were, is the feeling of the audience. Rocket Richard, the\nCanadian hockey player, used to comment on the poor acoustics of some arenas.\nHe felt that the puck off his stick rode on the roar of the crowd. Sport, as a\npopular art form, is not just self-expression but is deeply and necessarily a\nmeans of interplay within an entire culture.\n\nArt is not just play but an extension of human awareness in contrived and\nconventional patterns. Sport as popular art is a deep reaction to the typical\naction of the society. But high art, on the other hand, is not a reaction but\na profound reappraisal of a complex cultural state. Jean Genet’s The Balcony\nappeals to some people as a shatteringly logical appraisal of mankind’s\nmadness in its orgy of self-destruction. Genet offers a brothel enveloped by\nthe holocaust of war and revolution as an inclusive image of human life. It\nwould be easy to argue that Genet is hysterical, and that football offers a\nmore serious criticism of life than he does. Seen as live models of complex\nsocial situations, games may lack moral earnestness, it has to be admitted.\nPerhaps there is, just for this reason, a desperate need for games in a highly\nspecialized industrial culture, since they are the only form of art accessible\nto many minds. Real interplay is reduced to nothing in a specialist world of\ndelegated tasks and fragmented jobs. Some backward or tribal societies\nsuddenly translated into industrial and specialist forms of mechanization\ncannot easily devise the antidote of sports and games to create countervailing\nforce. They bog down into grim earnest. Men without art, and men without the\npopular arts of games, tend toward automatism.\n\nA comment on the different kinds of games played in the British Parliament and\nthe French Chamber of Deputies will rally the political experience of many\nreaders. The British had the luck to get the two-team pattern into the House\nbenches, whereas the French, trying for centralism by seating the deputies in\na semicircle facing the chair, got instead a multiplicity of teams playing a\ngreat variety of games. By trying for unity, the French got anarchy. The\nBritish, by setting up diversity, achieved, if anything, too much unity. The\nBritish representative, by playing his “side,” is not tempted into private\nmental effort, nor does he have to follow the debates until the ball is passed\nto him. As one critic said, if the benches did not face each other the British\ncould not tell truth from falsehood, nor wisdom from folly, unless they\nlistened to it _all_. And since most of the debate must be nonsense, it would\nbe stupid to listen to all.\n\nThe form of any game is of first importance. Game theory, like information\ntheory, has ignored this aspect of game and information movement. Both\ntheories have dealt with the information content of systems, and have observed\nthe “noise” and “deception” factors that divert data. This is like approaching\na painting or a musical composition from the point of view of its content. In\nother words, it is guaranteed to miss the central structural core of the\nexperience. For as it is the _pattern_ of a game that gives it relevance to\nour inner lives, and not who is playing nor the outcome of the game, so it is\nwith information movement. The selection of our human senses employed makes\nall the difference, say, between photo and telegraph. In the arts the\nparticular mix of our senses in the medium employed is all-important. The\nostensible program content is a lulling distraction needed to enable the\nstructural form to get through the barriers of conscious attention.\n\nAny game, like any medium of information, is an extension of the individual or\nthe group. Its effect on the group or individual is a reconfiguring of the\nparts of the group or individual that are not so extended. A work of art has\nno existence or function apart from its _effects_ on human observers. And art,\nlike games or popular arts, and like media of communication, has the power to\nimpose its own assumptions by setting the human community into new\nrelationships and postures.\n\nArt, like games, is a translator of experience. What we have already felt or\nseen in one situation we are suddenly given in a new kind of material. Games,\nlikewise, shift familiar experience into new forms, giving the bleak and the\nblear side of things sudden luminosity. The telephone companies make tapes of\nthe blither of boors, who inundate defenseless telephone operators with\nvarious kinds of revolting expressions. When played back this becomes salutary\nfun and play, and helps the operators to maintain equilibrium.\n\nThe world of science has become quite self-conscious about the play element in\nits endless experiments with models of situations otherwise unobservable.\nManagement training centers have long used games as a means of developing new\nbusiness perception. John Kenneth Galbraith argues that business must now\nstudy art, for the artist makes models of problems and situations that have\nnot yet emerged in the larger matrix of society, giving the artistically\nperceptive businessman a decade of leeway in his planning.\n\nIn the electric age, the closing of the gaps between art and business, or\nbetween campus and community, are part of the overall implosion that closes\nthe ranks of specialists at all levels. Flaubert, the French novelist of the\nnineteenth century, felt that the Franco-Prussian War could have been avoided\nif people had heeded his Sentimental Education. A similar feeling has since\ncome to be widely held by artists. They know that they are engaged in making\nlive models of situations that have not yet matured in the society at large.\nIn their artistic play, they discovered what is actually happening, and thus\nthey appear to be \"“ahead of their time.”\" Non-artists always look at the\npresent through the spectacles of the preceding age. General staffs are always\nmagnificently prepared to fight the previous war.\n\nGames, then, are contrived and controlled situations, extensions of group\nawareness that permit a respite from customary patterns. They are a kind of\ntalking to itself on the part of society as a whole. And talking to oneself is\na recognized form of play that is indispensable to any growth of self-\nconfidence. The British and Americans have enjoyed during recent times an\nenormous self-confidence born of the playful spirit of fun and games. When\nthey sense the absence of this spirit in their rivals, it causes\nembarrassment. To take mere worldly things in dead earnest betokens a defect\nof awareness that is pitiable. From the first days of Christianity there grew\na habit, in some quarters, of spiritual clowning, of \"“playing the fool in\nChrist,”\" as St. Paul put it. Paul also associated this sense of spiritual\nconfidence and Christianity play with the games and sports of his time. Play\ngoes with an awareness of huge disproportion between the ostensible situation\nand the real stakes. A similar sense hovers over the game situation, as such.\nSince the game, like any art form, is a mere tangible model of another\nsituation that is less accessible, there is always a tingling sense of oddity\nand fun in play or games that renders the very earnest and very serious person\nor society laughable. When the Victorian Englishman began to lean toward the\npole of seriousness, Oscar Wilde and Bernard Shaw and G. K. Chesterton moved\nin swiftly as countervailing force. Scholars have often pointed out that Plato\nconceived of play dedicated to the Deity as the loftiest reach of man’s\nreligious impulse.\n\nBergson’s famous treatise on laughter sets forth the idea of mechanism taking\nover life-values as the key to the ludicrous. To see a man slip on a banana\nskin is to see a rationally structured system suddenly translated into a\nwhirling machine. Since industrialism had created a similar situation in the\nsociety of his time, Bergson’s idea was readily accepted. He seems not to have\nnoticed that he had mechanically turned up a mechanical metaphor in a\nmechanical age in order to explain the very unmechanical thing, laughter, or\n\"“the mind sneezing,”\" as Wyndham Lewis described it.\n\nThe game spirit suffered a defeat a few years ago over the rigged TV quiz\nshows. For one thing, the big prize seemed to make fun of money. Money as\nstore of power and skill, and expediter of exchange, still has for many people\nthe ability to induce a trance of great earnestness. Movies, in a sense, are\nalso rigged shows. Any play or poem or novel is, also, rigged _to produce an\neffect_. So was the TV quiz show. But with the TV effect there is deep\naudience _participation_. Movie and drama do not permit as much participation\nas that afforded by the mosaic mesh of the TV image. So great was the audience\nparticipation in the quiz shows that the directors of the show were prosecuted\nas con men. Moreover press and radio ad interests, bitter about the success of\nthe new TV medium, were delighted to lacerate the flesh of their rivals. Of\ncourse, the riggers had been blithely unaware of the nature of their medium,\nand had given it the movie treatment of intense realism, instead of the softer\nmythic focus proper to TV. Charles Van Doren merely got clobbered as an\ninnocent bystander, and the whole investigation elicited no insight into the\nnature or effects of the TV medium. Regrettably, it simply provided a field\nday for the earnest moralizers. A moral point of view too often serves as a\nsubstitute for understanding in technological matters.\n\nThat games are extensions, not of our private but of our social selves, and\nthat they are media of communication, should now be plain. If, finally, we\nask, “Are games mass media?” the answer has to be “Yes.” Games are situations\ncontrived to permit simultaneous participation of many people in some\nsignificant pattern of their own corporate lives.\n\n\n![Telegraph: The Social Hormone](images/title-25.png)\n\nThe wireless telegraph was given spectacular publicity in 1910 when it led to\nthe arrest at sea of Dr. Hawley H. Crippen, a U.S. physician who had been\npracticing in London, murdered his wife, buried her in the cellar of their\nhome, and fled the country with his secretary aboard the liner _Montrose_. The\nsecretary was dressed as a boy, and the pair traveled as Mr. Robinson and son.\nCaptain George Kendall of the _Montrose_ became suspicious of the Robinsons,\nhaving read in the English papers about the Crippen case.\n\nThe _Montrose_ was one of the few ships then equipped with Marconi’s wireless.\nBinding his wireless operator to secrecy, Captain Kendall sent a message to\nScotland Yard, and the Yard sent Inspector Dews on a faster liner to race the\n_Montrose_ across the Atlantic. Inspector Dews, dressed as a pilot, boarded\nthe _Montrose_ before it reached port, and arrested Crippen. Eighteen months\nafter Crippen’s arrest, an act was passed in the British Parliament making it\ncompulsory for all passenger ships to carry wireless.\n\nThe Crippen case illustrates what happens to the best-laid plans of mice and\nmen in any organization when the instant speed of information movement begins.\nThere is a collapse of delegated authority and a dissolution of the pyramid\nand management structures made familiar in the organization chart. The\nseparation of functions, and the division of stages, spaces, and tasks are\ncharacteristic of literate and visual society and of the Western world. These\ndivisions tend to dissolve through the action of the instant and organic\ninterrelations of electricity.\n\nFormer German Armaments minister Albert Speer, in a speech at the Nuremberg\ntrials, made some bitter remarks about the effects of electric media on German\nlife: \"“The telephone, the teleprinter and the wireless made it possible for\norders from the highest levels to be given direct to the lowest levels, where,\non account of the absolute authority behind them, they were carried out\nuncritically.…”\"\n\nThe tendency of electric media is to create a kind of organic interdependence\namong all the institutions of society, emphasizing de Chardin’s view that the\ndiscovery of electro-magnetism is to be regarded as \"“a prodigious biological\nevent.”\" If political and commercial institutions take on a biological\ncharacter by means of electric communications, it is also common now for\nbiologists like Hans Selye to think of the physical organism as a\ncommunication network: \"“Hormone is a specific chemical messenger-substance,\nmade by an endocrine gland and secreted into the blood, to regulate and co-\nordinate the functions of distant organs.”\"\n\nThis peculiarity about the electric form, that it ends the mechanical age of\nindividual steps and specialist functions, has a direct explanation. Whereas\nall previous technology (save speech, itself) had, in effect, extended some\npart of our bodies, electricity may be said to have outered the central\nnervous system itself, including the brain. Our central nervous system is a\nunified field quite without segments. As J. Z. Young writes in Doubt and\nCertainty in Science: A Biologist’s Reflections on the Brain (Galaxy, Oxford\nUniversity Press, New York, 1960):\n\n> It may be that a great part of the secret of the brain’s power is the\n> enormous opportunity provided for interaction between the effects of\n> stimulating each part of the receiving fields. It is this provision of\n> interacting-places or mixing-places that allows us to react to the world _as\n> a whole_ to a much greater degree than most other animals can do.\n\nFailure to understand the organic character of electric technology is evident\nin our continuing concern with the dangers of mechanizing the world. Rather,\nwe are in great danger of wiping out our entire investment in the preelectric\ntechnology of the literate and mechanical kind by means of an indiscriminate\nuse of electrical energy. What makes a mechanism is the separation and\nextension of separate parts of our body as hand, arm, feet, in pen, hammer,\nwheel. And the mechanization of a task is done by segmentation of each part of\nan action in a series of uniform, repeatable, and movable parts. The exact\nopposite characterizes cybernation (or automation), which has been described\nas a way of thinking, as much as a way of doing. Instead of being concerned\nwith separate machines, cybernation looks at the production problem as an\nintegrated system of information handling.\n\nIt is this same provision of interacting places in the electric media that now\ncompels us to react to the world as a whole. Above all, however, it is the\nspeed of electric involvement that creates the integral whole of both private\nand public awareness. We live today in the Age of Information and of\nCommunication because electric media instantly and constantly create a total\nfield of interacting events in which all men participate. Now, the world of\npublic interaction has the same inclusive scope of integral interplay that has\nhitherto characterized only our private nervous systems. That is because\nelectricity is organic in character and confirms the organic social bond by\nits technological use in telegraph and telephone, radio, and other forms. The\nsimultaneity of electric communication, also characteristic of our nervous\nsystem, makes each of us present and accessible to every other person in the\nworld. To a large degree our co-presence everywhere at once in the electric\nage is a fact of passive, rather than active, experience. Actively, we are\nmore likely to have this awareness when reading the newspaper or watching a TV\nshow.\n\nOne way to grasp the change from the mechanical to the electric age is by\nnoticing the difference between the layout of a literary and a telegraph\npress, say between the London Times and the Daily Express, or between The New\nYork Times and the New York Daily News. It is the difference between columns\nrepresenting points of view, and a mosaic of unrelated scraps in a field\nunified by a dateline. Whatever else there is, there can be no point of view\nin a mosaic of simultaneous items. The world of impressionism, associated with\npainting in the late nineteenth century, found its more extreme form in the\n_pointillisme_ of Seurat and the refractions of light in the world of Monet\nand Renoir. The stipple of points of Seurat is close to the present technique\nof sending pictures by telegraph, and close to the form of the TV image or\nmosaic made by the scanning finger. All of these anticipate later electric\nforms because, like the digital computer with its multiple yes-no dots and\ndashes, they caress the contours of every kind of being by the multiple\ntouches of these points. Electricity offers a means of getting in touch with\nevery facet of being at once, like the brain itself. Electricity is only\nincidentally visual and auditory; it is primarily tactile.\n\nAs the age of electricity began to establish itself in the later nineteenth\ncentury, the entire world of the arts began to reach again for the iconic\nqualities of touch and sense interplay (synesthesia, as it was called) in\npoetry, as in painting. The German sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand inspired\nBerenson’s remark that “the painter can accomplish his task only by giving\ntactile values to retinal impressions.” Such a program involves the endowing\nof each plastic form with a kind of nervous system of its own.\n\nThe electric form of pervasive impression is profoundly tactile and organic,\nendowing each object with a kind of unified sensibility, as the cave painting\nhad done. The unconscious task of the painter in the new electric age was to\nraise this fact to the level of conscious awareness. From this time on, the\nmere specialist in any field was doomed to the sterility and inanity that\nechoed an archaic form of the departing mechanical age. Contemporary awareness\nhad to become integral and inclusive again, after centuries of dissociated\nsensibilities. The Bauhaus school became one of the great centers of effort\ntending toward an inclusive human awareness; but the same task was accepted by\na race of giants that sprang up in music and poetry, architecture, and\npainting. They gave the arts of this century an ascendancy over those of other\nages comparable to that which we have long recognized as true of modern\nscience.\n\nDuring its early growth, the telegraph was subordinate to railway and\nnewspaper, those immediate extensions of industrial production and marketing.\nIn fact, once the railways began to stretch across the continent, they relied\nvery much on the telegraph for their coordination, so that the image of the\nstationmaster and the telegraph operator were easily superimposed in the\nAmerican mind.\n\nIt was in 1844 that Samuel Morse opened a telegraph line from Washington to\nBaltimore with $30,000 obtained from Congress. Private enterprise, as usual,\nwaited for bureaucracy to clarify the image and goals of the new operation.\nOnce it proved profitable, the fury of private promotion and initiative became\nimpressive, leading to some savage episodes. No new technology, not even the\nrailroad, manifested a more rapid growth than the telegraph. By 1858 the first\ncable had been laid across the Atlantic, and by 1861 telegraph wires had\nreached across America. That each new method of transporting commodity or\ninformation should have to come into existence in a bitter competitive battle\nagainst previously existing devices is not surprising. Each innovation is not\nonly commercially disrupting, but socially and psychologically corroding, as\nwell.\n\nIt is instructive to follow the embryonic stages of any new growth, for during\nthis period of development it is much misunderstood, whether it be printing or\nthe motorcar or TV. Just because people are at first oblivious of its nature,\nthe new form deals some revealing blows to the zombie-eyed spectators. The\noriginal telegraph line between Baltimore and Washington promoted chess games\nbetween experts in the two cities. Other lines were used for lotteries and\nplay in general, just as early radio existed in isolation from any commercial\ncommitments and was, in fact, fostered by the amateur “hams” for years before\nit was seized by big interests.\n\nA few months ago John Crosby wrote to the New York Herald Tribune from Paris\nin a way that well illustrates why the “content” obsession of the man of print\nculture makes it difficult for him to notice any facts about the form of a new\nmedium:\n\n> Telstar, as you know, is that complicated ball that whirls through space,\n> transmitting television broadcasts, telephone messages, and everything\n> except common sense. When it was first cast aloft, trumpets sounded.\n> Continents would share each other’s intellectual pleasures. Americans would\n> enjoy Brigitte Bardot. Europeans would partake of the heady intellectual\n> stimulation of “Ben Casey” … The fundamental flaw in this communications\n> miracle is the same one that has bugged every communications miracle since\n> they started carving hieroglyphics on stone tablets. What do you say on it?\n> Telstar went into operation in August when almost nothing of importance was\n> happening anywhere in Europe. All the networks were ordered to say\n> something, anything, on this miracle instrument. \"“It was a new toy and they\n> just had to use it,”\" the men here say. CBS combed Europe for hot news and\n> came up with a sausage-eating contest, which was duly sent back via the\n> miracle ball, although that particular news event could have gone by\n> camelback without losing any of its essence.\n\nAny innovation threatens the equilibrium of existing organization. In big\nindustry new ideas are invited to rear their heads so that they can be\nclobbered at once. The idea department of a big firm is a sort of lab for\nisolating dangerous viruses. When one is found, it is assigned to a group for\nneutralizing and immunizing treatment. It is comical, therefore, when anybody\napplies to a big corporation with a new idea that would result in a great\n\"“increase of production and sales.”\" Such an increase would be a disaster for\nthe existing management. They would have to make way for new management.\nTherefore, no new idea ever starts from within a big operation. It must assail\nthe organization from outside, through some small but competing organization.\nIn the same way, the outering or extension of our bodies and senses in a “new\ninvention” compels the whole of our bodies and senses to shift into new\npositions in order to maintain equilibrium. A new “closure” is effected in all\nour organs and senses, both private and public, by any new invention. Sight\nand sound assume new postures, as do all the other faculties. With the\ntelegraph, the entire method, both of gathering and of presenting news, was\nrevolutionized. Naturally, the effects on language and on literary style and\nsubject matter were spectacular.\n\nIn the same year, 1844, then, that men were playing chess and lotteries on the\nfirst American telegraph, Søren Kierkegaard published The Concept of Dread.\nThe Age of Anxiety had begun. For with the telegraph, man had initiated that\noutering or extension of his central nervous system that is now approaching an\nextension of consciousness with satellite broadcasting. To put one’s nerves\noutside, and one’s physical organs inside the nervous system, or the brain, is\nto initiate a situation — if not a concept — of dread.\n\nHaving glanced at the major trauma of the telegraph on conscious life, noting\nthat it ushers in the Age of Anxiety and of Pervasive Dread, we can turn to\nsome specific instances of this uneasiness and growing jitters. Whenever any\nnew medium or human extension occurs, it creates a new myth for itself,\nusually associated with a major figure: Aretino, the Scourge of Princes and\nthe Puppet of Printing; Napoleon and the trauma of industrial change; Chaplin,\nthe public conscience of the movie; Hitler, the tribal totem of radio; and\nFlorence Nightingale, the first singer of human woe by telegraph wire.\n\nFlorence Nightingale (1820–1910), wealthy and refined member of the powerful\nnew English group engendered by industrial power, began to pick up human-\ndistress signals as a young lady. They were quite undecipherable at first.\nThey upset her entire way of life, and couldn’t be adjusted to her image of\nparents or friends or suitors. It was sheer genius that enabled her to\ntranslate the new diffused anxiety and dread of life into the idea of deep\nhuman involvement and hospital reform. She began to think, as well as to live,\nher time, and she discovered the new formula for the electronic age: Medicare.\nCare of the body became balm for the nerves in the age that had extended its\nnervous system outside itself for the first time in human history.\n\nTo put the Florence Nightingale story in new media terms is quite simple. She\narrived on a distant scene where controls from the London center were of the\ncommon pre-electric hierarchical pattern. Minute division and delegation of\nfunctions and separation of powers, normal in military and industrial\norganization then and long afterward, created an imbecile system of waste and\ninefficiency which for the first time got reported daily by telegraph. The\nlegacy of literacy and visual fragmentation came home to roost every day on\nthe telegraph wire:\n\n> In England fury succeeded fury. A great storm of rage, humiliation, and\n> despair had been gathering through the terrible winter of 1854–55. For the\n> first time in history, through reading the dispatches of Russell, the public\n> had realized \"“with what majesty the British soldier fights.”\" And these\n> heroes were dead. The men who had stormed the heights of Alma, charged with\n> the Light Brigade at Balaclava … had perished of hunger and neglect. Even\n> horses which had taken part in the Charge of the Light Brigade had starved\n> to death. (Lonely Crusader, Cecil Woodham-Smith, McGraw-Hill)\n\nThe horrors that William Howard Russell relayed by wire to The Times were\nnormal in British military life. He was the first war correspondent, because\nthe telegraph gave that immediate and inclusive dimension of “human interest”\nto news that does not belong to a “point of view.” It is merely a comment on\nour absentmindedness and general indifference that after more than a century\nof telegraph news reporting, nobody has seen that “human interest” is the\nelectronic or depth dimension of immediate involvement in news. With\ntelegraph, there ended that separation of interests and division of faculties\nthat are certainly not without their magnificent monuments of toil and\ningenuity. But with telegraph, came the integral insistence and wholeness of\nDickens, and of Florence Nightingale, and of Harriet Beecher Stowe. The\nelectric gives powerful voices to the weak and suffering, and sweeps aside the\nbureaucratic specialisms and job descriptions of the mind tied to a manual of\ninstructions. The “human interest” dimension is simply that of immediacy of\nparticipation in the experience of others that occurs with instant\ninformation. People become instant, too, in their response of pity or of fury\nwhen they must share the common extension of the central nervous system with\nthe whole of mankind. Under these conditions, “conspicuous waste” or\n“conspicuous consumption” become lost causes, and even the hardiest of the\nrich dwindle into modest ways of timid service to mankind.\n\nAt this point, some may still inquire why the telegraph should create “human\ninterest,” and why the earlier press did not. The section on The Press may\nhelp these readers. But there may also be a lurking obstacle to perception.\nThe instant all-at-onceness and total involvement of the telegraphic form\nstill repels some literary sophisticates. For them, visual continuity and\nfixed “point-of-view” render the immediate participation of the instant media\nas distasteful and unwelcome as popular sports. These people are as much media\nvictims, unwittingly mutilated by their studies and toil, as children in a\nVictorian blacking factory. For many people, then, who have had their\nsensibilities irremediably skewed and locked into the fixed postures of\nmechanical writing and printing, the iconic forms of the electric age are as\nopaque, or even as invisible, as hormones to the unaided eye. It is the\nartist’s job to try to dislocate older media into postures that permit\nattention to the new. To this end, the artist must ever play and experiment\nwith new means of arranging experience, even though the majority of his\naudience may prefer to remain fixed in their old perceptual attitudes. The\nmost that can be done by the prose commentator is to capture the media in as\nmany characteristic and revealing postures as he can manage to discover. Let\nus examine a series of these postures of the telegraph, as this new medium\nencounters other media like the book and the newspaper.\n\nBy 1848 the telegraph, then only four years old, compelled several major\nAmerican newspapers to form a collective organization for newsgathering. This\neffort became the basis of the Associated Press, which, in turn, sold news\nservice to subscribers. In one sense, the real meaning of this form of the\nelectric, instant coverage was concealed by the mechanical overlay of the\nvisual and industrial patterns of print and printing. The specifically\nelectric effect may seem to appear in this instance as a centralizing and\ncompressional force. By many analysts, the electric revolution has been\nregarded as a continuation of the process of the mechanization of mankind.\nCloser inspection reveals quite a different character. For example, the\nregional press, that had had to rely on postal service and political control\nthrough the post office, quickly escaped from this center-margin type of\nmonopoly by means of the new telegraph services. Even in England, where short\ndistances and concentrated population made the railway a powerful agent of\ncentralism, the monopoly of London was dissolved by the invention of the\ntelegraph, which now encouraged provincial competition. The telegraph freed\nthe marginal provincial press from dependence on the big metropolitan press.\nIn the whole field of the electric revolution, this pattern of\ndecentralization appears in multiple guises. It is Sir Lewis Namier’s view\nthat telephone and airplane are the biggest single cause of trouble in the\nworld today. Professional diplomats with delegated powers have been supplanted\nby prime ministers, presidents, and foreign secretaries, who think they could\nconduct all important negotiations personally. This is also the problem\nencountered in big business, where it has been found impossible to exercise\ndelegated authority when using the telephone. The very nature of the\ntelephone, as all electric media, is to compress and unify that which had\npreviously been divided and specialized. Only the “authority of knowledge”\nworks by telephone because of the speed that creates a total and inclusive\nfield of relations. Speed requires that the decisions made be inclusive, not\nfragmentary or partial, so that literate people typically resist the\ntelephone. But radio and TV, we shall see, have the same power of imposing an\ninclusive order, as of an oral organization. Quite in contrast is the center-\nmargin form of visual and written structures of authority.\n\nMany analysts have been misled by electric media because of the seeming\nability of these media to extend man’s spatial powers of organization.\nElectric media, however, abolish the spatial dimension, rather than enlarge\nit. By electricity, we everywhere resume person-to-person relations as if on\nthe smallest village scale. It is a relation in depth, and without delegation\nof functions or powers. The organic everywhere supplants the mechanical.\nDialogue supersedes the lecture. The greatest dignitaries hobnob with youth.\nWhen a group of Oxford undergraduates heard that Rudyard Kipling received ten\nshillings for every word he wrote, they sent him ten shillings by telegram\nduring their meeting: \"“Please send us one of your very best words.”\" Back\ncame the word a few minutes later: \"“Thanks.”\"\n\nThe hybrids of electricity and the older mechanics have been numerous. Some of\nthem, such as the phonograph and the movie, are discussed elsewhere in this\nvolume. Today the wedding of mechanical and electric technology draws to a\nclose, with TV replacing the movie and Telstar threatening the wheel. A\ncentury ago the effect of the telegraph was to send the presses racing faster,\njust as the application of the electric spark was to make possible the\ninternal-combustion engine with its instant precision. Pushed further,\nhowever, the electric principle everywhere dissolves the mechanical technique\nof visual separation and analysis of functions. Electronic tapes with exactly\nsynchronized information replace the old lineal sequence of the assembly line.\n\nAcceleration is a formula for dissolution and breakdown in any organization.\nSince the entire mechanical technology of the Western world has been wedded to\nelectricity, it has pushed toward higher speeds. All the mechanical aspects of\nour world seem to probe toward self-liquidation. The United States had built\nup a large degree of central political controls through the interplay of the\nrailway, the post office, and the newspaper. In 1848 the Postmaster General\nwrote, in his report, that newspapers have \"“always been esteemed of so much\nimportance to the public, as the best means of disseminating intelligence\namong the people, that the lowest rate has always been afforded for the\npurpose of encouraging their circulation.”\" The telegraph quickly weakened\nthis center-margin pattern and, more important, by intensifying the volume of\nnews, it greatly weakened the role of editorial opinions. News has steadily\novertaken views as a shaper of public attitudes, though few examples of this\nchange are quite so striking as the sudden growth of the Florence Nightingale\nimage in the British world. And yet nothing has been more misunderstood than\nthe power of the telegraph in this matter. Perhaps the most decisive feature\nis this. The natural dynamic of the book and, also, newspaper is to create a\nunified national outlook on a centralized pattern. All literate people,\ntherefore, experience a desire for an extension of the most enlightened\nopinions in a uniform horizontal and homogeneous pattern to the “most backward\nareas,” and to the least literate minds. The telegraph ended that hope. It\ndecentralized the newspaper world so thoroughly that uniform national views\nwere quite impossible, even before the Civil War. Perhaps, an even more\nimportant consequence of the telegraph was that in America the literary talent\nwas drawn into journalism, rather than into the book medium. Poe and Twain and\nHemingway are examples of writers who could find neither training nor outlet\nsave through the newspaper. In Europe, on the other hand, the numerous small\nnational groups presented a discontinuous mosaic that the telegraph merely\nintensified. The result was that the telegraph in Europe strengthened the\nposition of the book, and forced even the press to assume a literary\ncharacter.\n\nNot least of the developments since the telegraph has been the weather\nforecast, perhaps the most popularly participative of all the human interest\nitems in the daily press. In the early days of telegraph, rain created\nproblems in the grounding of wires. These problems drew attention to weather\ndynamics. One report in Canada in 1883 stated: \"“It was early discovered that\nwhen the wind at Montreal was from the East or North-East, rain storms\ntraveled from the West, and the stronger the land current, the faster came the\nrain from the opposite direction.”\" It is clear that telegraph, by providing a\nwide sweep of instant information, could reveal meteorological patterns of\nforce quite beyond observation by pre-electric man.\n\n  *[CBS]: Columbia Broadcasting System\n\n\n![The Typewriter: Into the Age of the Iron Whim](images/title-26.png)\n\nThe comments of Robert Lincoln O’Brien, writing in the Atlantic Monthly in\n1904, indicate a rich field of social material that still remains unexplored.\nFor example:\n\n> The invention of the typewriter has given a tremendous impetus to the\n> dictating habit … This means not only greater diffuseness … but it also\n> brings forward the point of view of the one who speaks. There is the\n> disposition on the part of the talker to explain, as if watching the facial\n> expression of his hearers to see how far they are following. This attitude\n> is not lost when his audience is following. It is no uncommon thing in the\n> typewriting booths at the Capitol in Washington to see Congressmen in\n> dictating letters use the most vigorous gestures as if the oratorical\n> methods of persuasion could be transmitted to the printed page.\n\nIn 1882, ads proclaimed that the typewriter could be used as an aid in\nlearning to read, write, spell, and punctuate. Now, eighty years later, the\ntypewriter is used only in experimental classrooms. The ordinary classroom\nstill holds the typewriter at bay as a merely attractive and distractive toy.\nBut poets like Charles Olson are eloquent in proclaiming the power of the\ntypewriter to help the poet to indicate exactly the breath, the pauses, the\nsuspension, even, of syllables, the juxtaposition, even, of parts of phrases\nwhich he intends, observing that, for the first time, the poet has the stave\nand the bar that the musician has had.\n\nThe same kind of autonomy and independence which Charles Olson claims that the\ntypewriter confers on the voice of the poet was claimed for the typewriter by\nthe career woman of fifty years ago. British women were reputed to have\ndeveloped a “twelve-pound look” when typewriters became available for sixty\ndollars or so. This look was in some way related to the Viking gesture of\nIbsen’s Nora Helmer, who slammed the door of her doll’s house and set off on a\nquest of vocation and soul-testing. The age of the iron whim had begun.\n\nThe reader will recall earlier mention that when the first wave of female\ntypists hit the business office in the 1890s, the cuspidor manufacturers read\nthe sign of doom. They were right. More important, the uniform ranks of\nfashionable lady typists made possible a revolution in the garment industry.\nWhat she wore, every farmer’s daughter wanted to wear, for the typist was a\npopular figure of enterprise and skill. She was a style-maker who was also\neager to follow styles. As much as the typewriter, the typist brought into\nbusiness a new dimension of the uniform, the homogeneous, and the continuous\nthat has made the typewriter indispensable to every aspect of mechanical\nindustry. A modern battleship needs dozens of typewriters for ordinary\noperations. An army needs more typewriters than medium and light artillery\npieces, even in the field, suggesting that the typewriter now fuses the\nfunctions of the pen and sword.\n\nBut the effect of the typewriter is not all of this kind. If the typewriter\nhas contributed greatly to the familiar forms of the homogenized specialism\nand fragmentation that is print culture, it has also caused an integration of\nfunctions and the creation of much private independence. G. K. Chesterton\ndemurred about this new independence as a delusion, remarking that \"“women\nrefused to be dictated to and went out and became stenographers.”\" The poet or\nnovelist now composes on the typewriter. The typewriter fuses composition and\npublication, causing an entirely new attitude to the written and printed word.\nComposing on the typewriter has altered the forms of the language and of\nliterature in ways best seen in the later novels of Henry James that were\ndictated to Miss Theodora Bosanquet, who took them down, not by shorthand, but\non a typewriter. Her memoir, Henry James at Work, should have been followed by\nother studies of how the typewriter has altered English verse and prose, and,\nindeed, the very mental habits, themselves, of writers.\n\nWith Henry James, the typewriter had become a confirmed habit by 1907, and his\nnew style developed a sort of free, incantatory quality. His secretary tells\nof how he found dictating not only easier but more inspiring than composing by\nhand: \"“It all seems to be so much more effectively and unceasingly _pulled\nout_ of me in speech than in writing,”\" he told her. Indeed, he became so\nattached to the sound of his typewriter that, on his deathbed, Henry James\ncalled for his Remington to be worked near his bedside.\n\nJust how much the typewriter has contributed by its unjustified right-hand\nmargin to the development of _vers libre_ would be hard to discover, but free\nverse was really a recovery of spoken, dramatic stress in poetry, and the\ntypewriter encouraged exactly this quality. Seated at the typewriter, the\npoet, much in the manner of the jazz musician, has the experience of\nperformance as composition. In the nonliterate world, this had been the\nsituation of the bard or minstrel. He had themes, but no text. At the\ntypewriter, the poet commands the resources of the printing press. The machine\nis like a public-address system immediately at hand. He can shout or whisper\nor whistle, and make funny typographic faces at the audience, as does e. e.\ncummings in this sort of verse:\n\n> In Just-\n>\n> spring when the world is mud-\n>\n> luscious the little\n>\n> lame baloonman\n>\n> whistles far and wee\n>\n> and eddieandbill come\n>\n> running from marbles and\n>\n> piracies and it’s\n>\n> spring\n>\n> when the world is puddle wonderful\n>\n> the queer\n>\n> old baloonman whistles\n>\n> far and wee\n>\n> and bettyandisbel come dancing\n>\n> from hop-scotch and jump-rope and\n>\n> it’s spring\n>\n> and\n>\n> the\n>\n> goat footed\n>\n> baloonman whistles\n>\n> far\n>\n> and\n>\n> wee\n\ne. e. cummings is here using the typewriter to provide a poem with a musical\nscore for choral speech. The older poet, separated from the print form by\nvarious technical stages, could enjoy none of the freedom of oral stress\nprovided by the typewriter. The poet at the typewriter can do Njinsky leaps or\nChaplin-like shuffles and wiggles. Because he is an audience for his own\nmechanical audacities, he never ceases to react to his own performance.\nComposing on the typewriter is like flying a kite.\n\nThe e. e. cummings poem, when read aloud with widely varying stresses and\npaces, will duplicate the perceptual process of its typewriting creator. How\nGerard Manley Hopkins would have loved to have had a typewriter to compose on!\nPeople who feel that poetry is for the eye and is to be read silently can\nscarcely get anywhere with Hopkins or cummings. Read aloud, such poetry\nbecomes quite natural. Putting first names in lower case, as “eddieandbill,”\nbothered the literate people of forty years ago. It was supposed to.\n\nEliot and Pound used the typewriter for a great variety of central effects in\ntheir poems. And with them, too, the typewriter was an oral and mimetic\ninstrument that gave them the colloquial freedom of the world of jazz and\nragtime. Most colloquial and jazzy of all Eliot’s poems, Sweeney Agonistes, in\nits first appearance in print, carried the note: “From Wanna Go Home Baby?”\n\nThat the typewriter, which carried the Gutenberg technology into every nook\nand cranny of our culture and economy, should, also, have given out with these\nopposite oral effects is a characteristic reversal. Such a reversal of form\nhappens in all extremes of advanced technology, as with the wheel today.\n\nAs expediter, the typewriter brought writing and speech and publication into\nclose association. Although a merely mechanical form, it acted in some\nrespects as an implosion, rather than an explosion.\n\nIn its explosive character, confirming the existing procedures of movable\ntypes, the typewriter had an immediate effect in regulating spelling and\ngrammar. The pressure of Gutenberg technology toward “correct” or uniform\nspelling and grammar was felt at once. Typewriters caused an enormous\nexpansion in the sale of dictionaries. They also created the innumerable\noverstuffed files that led to the rise of the file-cleaning companies in our\ntime. At first, however, the typewriter was not seen as indispensable to\nbusiness. The personal touch of the hand-penned letter was considered so\nimportant that the typewriter was ruled out of commercial use by the pundits.\nThey thought, however, that it might be of use to authors, clergymen, and\ntelegraph operators. Even newspapers were lukewarm about this machine for some\ntime.\n\nOnce any part of the economy feels a step-up in pace, the rest of the economy\nhas to follow suit. Soon, no business could be indifferent to the greatly\nincreased pace set by the typewriter. It was the telephone, paradoxically,\nthat sped the commercial adoption of the typewriter. The phrase “Send me a\nmemo on that,” repeated into millions of phones daily, helped to create the\nhuge expansion of the typist function. Northcote Parkinson’s law that \"“work\nexpands so as to fill the time available for its completion”\" is precisely the\nzany dynamic provided by the telephone. In no time at all, the telephone\nexpanded the work to be done on the typewriter to huge dimensions. Pyramids of\npaperwork rise on the basis of a small telephone network inside a single\nbusiness. Like the typewriter, the telephone fuses functions, enabling the\ncall-girl, for example, to be her own procurer and madam.\n\nNorthcote Parkinson had discovered that any business or bureaucratic structure\nfunctions by itself, independently of \"“the work to be done.”\" The number of\npersonnel and \"“the quality of the work are not related to each other at\nall.”\" In any given structure, the rate of staff accumulation is not related\nto the work done but to the intercommunication among the staff, itself. (In\nother words, the medium is the message.) Mathematically stated, Parkinson’s\nLaw says that the rate of accumulation of office staff per annum will be\nbetween 5.17 per cent and 6.56 per cent, \"“irrespective of any variation in\nthe amount of work (if any) to be done.”\"\n\n\"“Work to be done,”\" of course, means the transformation of one kind of\nmaterial energy into some new form, as trees into lumber or paper, or clay\ninto bricks or plates, or metal into pipe. In terms of this kind of work, the\naccumulation of office personnel in a navy, for example, goes up as the number\nof ships goes down. What Parkinson carefully hides from himself and his\nreaders is simply the fact that in the area of information movement, the main\n\"“work to be done”\" is actually the movement of information. The mere\ninterrelating of people by selected information is now the principal source of\nwealth in the electric age. In the preceding mechanical age, work had not been\nlike that at all. Work had meant the processing of various materials by\nassembly-line fragmentation of operations and hierarchically delegated\nauthority. Electric power circuits, in relation to the same processing,\neliminate both the assembly line and the delegated authority. Especially with\nthe computer, the work effort is applied at the “programming” level, and such\neffort is one of information and knowledge. In the decision-making and “make\nhappen” aspect of the work operation, the telephone and other such speedups of\ninformation have ended the divisions of delegated authority in favor of the\n“authority of knowledge.” It is as if a symphony composer, instead of sending\nhis manuscript to the printer and thence to the conductor and to the\nindividual members of the orchestra, were to compose directly on an electronic\ninstrument that would render each note or theme as if on the appropriate\ninstrument. This would end at once all the delegation and specialism of the\nsymphony orchestra that makes it such a natural model of the mechanical and\nindustrial age. The typewriter, with regard to the poet or novelist, comes\nvery close to the promise of electronic music, insofar as it compresses or\nunifies the various jobs of poetic composition and publication.\n\nThe historian Daniel Boorstin was scandalized by the fact that celebrity in\nour information age was not due to a person’s having done anything but simply\nto his being known for being well known. Professor Parkinson is scandalized\nthat the structure of human work now seems to be quite independent of any job\nto be done. As an economist, he reveals the same incongruity and comedy, as\nbetween the old and the new, that Stephen Potter does in his Gamesmanship.\nBoth have revealed the hollow mockery of \"“getting ahead in the world,”\" in\nits old sense. Neither honest toil nor clever ploy will serve to advance the\neager executive. The reason is simple. Positional warfare is finished, both in\nprivate and corporate action. In business, as in society, “getting on” may\nmean getting out. There is no “ahead” in a world that is an echo chamber of\ninstantaneous celebrity.\n\nThe typewriter, with its promise of careers for the Nora Helmers of the West,\nhas really turned out to be an elusive pumpkin coach, after all.\n\n\n![The Telephone: Sounding Brass or Tinkling Symbol?](images/title-27.png)\n\nThe readers of the New York Evening Telegram were told in 1904: \"“Phony\nimplies that a thing so qualified has no more substance than a telephone talk\nwith a supposititious friend.”\" The folklore of the telephone in song and\nstory has been augmented in the memoirs of Jack Paar, who writes that his\nresentment toward the telephone began with the singing telegram. He tells how\nhe got a call from a woman who said she was so lonesome she had been taking a\nbath three times a day in hopes that the phone would ring.\n\nJames Joyce in Finnegans Wake headlined Television Kills Telephony In Brothers\nBroil, introducing a major theme in the battle of the technologically extended\nsenses that has, indeed, been raging through our culture for more than a\ndecade. With the telephone, there occurs the extension of ear and voice that\nis a kind of extrasensory perception. With television came the extension of\nthe sense of touch or of sense interplay that even more intimately involves\nthe entire sensorium.\n\nThe child and the teenager understand the telephone, embracing the cord and\nthe ear-mike as if they were beloved pets. What we call “the French phone,”\nthe union of mouthpiece and earphone in a single instrument, is a significant\nindication of the French liaison of the senses that English-speaking people\nkeep firmly separate. French is \"“the language of love”\" just because it\nunites voice and ear in an especially close way, as does the telephone. So it\nis quite natural to kiss via phone, but not easy to visualize while phoning.\n\nNo more unexpected social result of the telephone has been observed than its\nelimination of the red-light district and its creation of the call-girl. To\nthe blind, all things are unexpected. The form and character of the telephone,\nas of all electric technology, appear fully in this spectacular development.\nThe prostitute was a specialist, and the call-girl is not. A “house” was not a\nhome; but the call-girl not only lives at home, she may be a matron. The power\nof the telephone to decentralize every operation and to end positional\nwarfare, as well as localized prostitution, has been felt but not understood\nby every business in the land.\n\nThe telephone, in the case of the call-girl, is like the typewriter that fuses\nthe functions of composition and publication. The call-girl dispenses with the\nprocurer and the madam. She has to be an articulate person of varied\nconversation and social accomplishments since she is expected to be able to\njoin any company on a basis of social equality. If the typewriter has\nsplintered woman from the home and turned her into a specialist in the office,\nthe telephone gave her back to the executive world as a general means of\nharmony, an invitation to happiness, and a sort of combined confessional-and-\nwailing wall for the immature American executive.\n\nThe typewriter and the telephone are most unidentical twins that have taken\nover the revamping of the American girl with technological ruthlessness and\nthoroughness.\n\nSince all media are fragments of ourselves extended into the public domain,\nthe action upon us of any one medium tends to bring the other senses into play\nin a new relation. As we read, we provide a sound track for the printed word;\nas we listen to the radio, we provide a visual accompaniment. Why can we not\nvisualize while telephoning? At once the reader will protest, “But I do\nvisualize on the telephone!” When he has a chance to try the experiment\ndeliberately, he will find that he simply can’t visualize while phoning,\nthough all literate people try to do so and, therefore, believe they are\nsucceeding. But that is not what most irritates the literate and visualizing\nWesterner about the telephone. Some people can scarcely talk to their best\nfriends on the phone without becoming angry. The telephone demands complete\nparticipation, unlike the written and printed page. Any literate man resents\nsuch a heavy demand for his total attention, because he has long been\naccustomed to fragmentary attention. Similarly, literate man can learn to\nspeak other languages only with great difficulty, for learning a language\ncalls for participation of all the senses at once. On the other hand, our\nhabit of visualizing renders the literate Westerner helpless in the nonvisual\nworld of advanced physics. Only the visceral and audile-tactile Teuton and\nSlav have the needed immunity to visualization for work in the non-Euclidean\nmath and quantum physics. Were we to teach our math and physics by telephone,\neven a highly literate and abstract Westerner could eventually compete with\nthe European physicists. This fact does not interest the Bell Telephone\nresearch department, for like any other book-oriented group they are oblivious\nto the telephone as a _form_ , and study only the content aspect of wire\nservice. As already mentioned, the Shannon and Weaver[5](end-notes.xhtml#n5)\nhypothesis about Information Theory, like the Morgenstern Game Theory, tends\nto ignore the function of the form as form. Thus both Information Theory and\nGame Theory have bogged down into sterile banalities, but the psychic and\nsocial changes resulting from these forms have altered the whole of our lives.\n\nMany people feel a strong urge to “doodle” while telephoning. This fact is\nvery much related to the characteristic of this medium, namely that it demands\nparticipation of our senses and faculties. Unlike radio, it cannot be used as\nbackground. Since the telephone offers a very poor auditory image, we\nstrengthen and complete it by the use of all the other senses. When the\nauditory image is of high definition, as with radio, we visualize the\nexperience or complete it with the sense of sight. When the visual image is of\nhigh definition or intensity, we complete it by providing sound. That is why,\nwhen the movies added sound track, there was such deep artistic upset. In fact\nthe disturbance was almost equal to that caused by the movie itself. For the\nmovie is a rival of the book, tending to provide a visual track of narrative\ndescription and statement that is much fuller than the written word.\n\nIn the 1920s a popular song was “All Alone by the Telephone, All Alone Feeling\nBlue.” Why should the phone create an intense feeling of loneliness? Why\nshould we feel compelled to answer a ringing public phone when we know the\ncall cannot concern us? Why does a phone ringing on the stage create instant\ntension? Why is that tension so very much less for an unanswered phone in a\nmovie scene? The answer to all of these questions is simply that the phone is\na participant form that demands a partner, with all the intensity of electric\npolarity. It simply will not act as a background instrument like radio.\n\nA standard practical joke of the small town in the early days of the telephone\ndraws attention to the phone as a form of communal participation. No back\nfence could begin to rival the degree of heated participation made possible by\nthe partyline. The joke in question took the form of calling several people,\nand, in an assumed voice, saying that the engineering department was going to\nclean out the telephone lines: \"“We recommend that you cover your telephone\nwith a sheet or pillow case to prevent your room from being filled with dirt\nand grease.”\" The jokester would then make the rounds of his friends in\nquestion to enjoy their preparations and their momentary expectation of a hiss\nand roar that was sure to come when the lines were blown out. The joke now\nserves to recall that not long ago the phone was a new contraption, used more\nfor entertainment than for business.\n\nThe invention of the telephone was an incident in the larger effort of the\npast century to render speech visible. Melville Bell, the father of Alexander\nGraham Bell, spent his life devising a universal alphabet that he published in\n1867 under the title Visible Speech. Besides the aim to make all the languages\nof the world immediately present to each other in a simple visual form, the\nBells, father and son, were much concerned to improve the state of the deaf.\nVisible speech seemed to promise immediate means of release for the deaf from\ntheir prison. Their struggle to perfect visible speech for the deaf led the\nBells to a study of the new electrical devices that yielded the telephone. In\nmuch the same way, the Braille system of dots-for-letters had begun as a means\nof reading military messages in darkness, then was transferred to music, and\nfinally to reading for the blind. Letters had been codified as dots for the\nfingers long before the Morse Code was developed for telegraph use. And it is\nrelevant to note how electric technology, in like manner, had converged on the\nworld of speech and language, from the beginning of electricity. That which\nhad been the first great extension of our central nervous system — the mass\nmedia of the spoken word — was soon wedded to the second great extension of\nthe central nervous system — electric technology.\n\nThe New York Daily Graphic for March 15, 1877, portrayed on its front page\n“The Terrors of the Telephone —The Orator of the Future.” A disheveled\nSvengali stands before a microphone haranguing in a studio. The same mike is\nshown in London, San Francisco, on the Prairies, and in Dublin. Curiously, the\nnewspaper of that time saw the telephone as a rival to the press as P.A.\nsystem, such as radio was in fact to be fifty years later. But the telephone,\nintimate and personal, is the most removed of any medium from the P.A. form.\nThus wire-tapping seems even more odious than the reading of other people’s\nletters.\n\nThe word “telephone” came into existence in 1840, before Alexander Graham Bell\nwas born. It was used to describe a device made to convey musical notes\nthrough wooden rods. By the 1870s, inventors in many places were trying to\nachieve the electrical transmission of speech, and the American Patent Office\nreceived Elisha Gray’s design for a telephone on the same day as Bell’s, but\nan hour or two later. The legal profession benefited enormously from this\ncoincidence. But Bell got the fame, and his rivals became footnotes. The\ntelephone presumed to offer service to the public in 1877, paralleling wire\ntelegraphy. The new telephone group was puny beside the vast telegraph\ninterests, and Western Union moved at once to establish control over the\ntelephone service.\n\nIt is one of the ironies of Western man that he has never felt any concern\nabout invention as a threat to his way of life. The fact is that, from the\nalphabet to the motorcar, Western man has been steadily refashioned in a slow\ntechnological explosion that has extended over 2,500 years. From the time of\nthe telegraph onward, however, Western man began to live an implosion. He\nbegan suddenly with Nietzschean insouciance to play the movie of his\n2,500-year explosion backward. But he still enjoys the results of the extreme\nfragmentation of the original components of his tribal life. It is this\nfragmentation that enables him to ignore cause-and-effect in all interplay of\ntechnology and culture. It is quite different in Big Business. There, tribal\nman is on the alert for stray seeds of change. That was why William H. Whyte\ncould write The Organization Man as a horror story. Eating people is wrong.\nEven grafting people into the ulcer of a big corporation seems wrong to\nanybody brought up in literate visual fragmented freedom. \"“I call them up at\nnight when their guard’s down,”\" said one senior executive.\n\nIn the 1920s, the telephone spawned a good deal of dialogue humor that sold as\ngramophone records. But radio and the talking pictures were not kind to the\nmonologue, even when it was made by W. C. Fields or Will Rogers. These hot\nmedia pushed aside the cooler forms that TV has now brought back on a large\nscale. The new race of night-club entertainers (Newhart, Nichols and May) have\na curious early-telephone flavor that is very welcome, indeed. We can thank\nTV, with its call for such high participation, that mime and dialogue are\nback. Our Mort Sahls and Shelley Bermans and Jack Paars are almost a variety\nof “living newspaper,” such as was provided for the Chinese revolutionary\nmasses by dramatic teams in the 1930s and 1940s. Brecht’s plays have the same\nparticipational quality of the world of the comic strip and the newspaper\nmosaic that TV has made acceptable, as pop art.\n\nThe mouthpiece of the telephone was a direct outgrowth of a prolonged attempt\nbeginning in the seventeenth century to mimic human physiology by mechanical\nmeans. It is very much in the nature of the electric telephone, therefore,\nthat it has such natural congruity with the organic. On the advice of a Boston\nsurgeon, Dr. C. J. Blake, the receiver of the phone was directly modeled on\nthe bone and diaphragm structure of the human ear. Bell paid much attention to\nthe work of the great Helmholtz, whose work covered many fields. Indeed, it\nwas because of his conviction that Helmholtz had sent vowels by telegraph that\nBell was encouraged to persevere in his efforts. It turned out that it was his\ninadequate German that had fostered this optimistic impression. Helmholtz had\nfailed to achieve any speech effects by wire. But Bell argued, if vowels could\nbe sent, why not consonants? \"“I thought that Helmholtz, himself, had done it,\nand that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a very\nvaluable blunder. It gave me confidence. If I had been able to read German in\nthose days I might never have commenced my experiments!”\"\n\nOne of the most startling consequences of the telephone was its introduction\nof a “seamless web” of interlaced patterns in management and decision-making.\nIt is not feasible to exercise delegated authority by telephone. The pyramidal\nstructure of job-division and description and delegated powers cannot\nwithstand the speed of the phone to by-pass all hierarchical arrangements, and\nto involve people in depth. In the same way, mobile panzer divisions equipped\nwith radio telephones upset the traditional army structure. And we have seen\nhow the news reporter linking the printed page to the telephone and the\ntelegraph created a unified corporate image out of the fragmented government\ndepartments.\n\nToday the junior executive can get on a first-name basis with seniors in\ndifferent parts of the country. \"“You just start telephoning. Anybody can walk\ninto any manager’s office by telephone. By ten o’clock of the day I hit the\nNew York office I was calling everybody by their first names.”\"\n\nThe telephone is an irresistible intruder in time or place, so that high\nexecutives attain immunity to its call only when dining at head tables. In its\nnature the telephone is an intensely personal form that ignores all the claims\nof visual privacy prized by literate man. One firm of stockbrokers recently\nabolished all private offices for its executives, and settled them around a\nkind of seminar table. It was felt that the instant decisions that had to be\nmade based on the continuous flow of teletype and other electric media could\nonly receive group approval fast enough if private space were abolished. When\non the alert, even the grounded crews of military aircraft cannot be out of\nsight of one another at any time. This is merely a time factor. More relevant\nis the need for total involvement in _role_ that goes with this instant\nstructure. The two pilots of one Canadian jet fighter are matched with all the\ncare used in a marriage bureau. After many tests and long experience together\nthey are officially _married_ by their commanding officer \"“till death do you\npart.”\" There is no tongue-in-cheek about this. It is this same kind of total\nintegration into a role that raises the hackles of any literate man faced by\nthe implosive demands of the seamless web of electric decision-making. Freedom\nin the Western world has always taken the form of the explosive, the divisive,\nadvancing the separation of the individual from the state. The reversal of\nthat one-way movement outward from center-to-margin is as clearly owing to\nelectricity as the great Western explosion had, in the first place, been due\nto phonetic literacy.\n\nIf delegated chain-of-command authority won’t work by telephone but only by\nwritten instruction, what sort of authority does come into play? The answer is\nsimple, but not easy to convey. On the telephone only the authority of\nknowledge will work. Delegated authority is lineal, visual, hierarchical. The\nauthority of knowledge is nonlineal, nonvisual, and inclusive. To act, the\ndelegated person must always get clearance from the chain-of-command. The\nelectric situation eliminates such patterns; such “checks and balances” are\nalien to the inclusive authority of knowledge. Consequently, restraints on\nelectric absolutist power can be achieved, not by the separation of powers,\nbut by a pluralism of centers. This problem has arisen apropos of the direct\nprivate line from the Kremlin to the White House. President Kennedy stated his\npreference for teletype over telephone, with a natural Western bias.\n\nThe separation of powers had been a technique for restraining action in a\ncentralist structure radiating out to remote margins. In an electric structure\nthere are, so far as the time and space of this planet are concerned, no\nmargins. There can, therefore, be dialogue only among centers and among\nequals. The chain-of-command pyramids cannot obtain support from electric\ntechnology. But in place of delegated power, there tends to appear again with\nelectric media, the _role_. A person can now be reinvested with all kinds of\nnonvisual character. King and emperor were legally endowed to act as the\ncollective ego of all the private egos of their subjects. So far, Western man\nhas encountered the restoration of the role only tentatively. He still manages\nto keep individuals in delegated _jobs_. In the cult of the movie star, we\nhave allowed ourselves somnambulistically to abandon our Western traditions,\nconferring on these jobless images a mystic role. They are collective\nembodiments of the multitudinous private lives of their subjects.\n\nAn extraordinary instance of the power of the telephone to involve the whole\nperson is recorded by psychiatrists, who report that neurotic children lose\nall neurotic symptoms when telephoning. The New York Times of September 7,\n1949, printed an item that provides bizarre testimony to the cooling\nparticipational character of the telephone:\n\n> On September 6, 1949, a psychotic veteran, Howard B. Unruh, in a mad rampage\n> on the streets of Camden, New Jersey, killed thirteen people, and then\n> returned home. Emergency crews, bringing up machine guns, shotguns, and tear\n> gas bombs, opened fire. At this point an editor on the Camden Evening\n> Courier looked up Unruh’s name in the telephone directory and called him.\n> Unruh stopped firing and answered, “Hello.”\n>\n> “This Howard?”\n>\n> “Yes.…”\n>\n> “Why are you killing people?”\n>\n> “I don’t know. I can’t answer that yet. I’ll have to talk to you later. I’m\n> too busy now.”\n\nArt Seidenbaum, in a recent article in the Los Angeles Times, “Dialectics of\nUnlisted Telephone Numbers,” said:\n\n> Celebrities have been hiding for a long time. Paradoxically, as their names\n> and images are bloated on ever widening screens, they take increasing pains\n> to be unapproachable in the flesh or phone … Many big names never answer up\n> to their numbers; a service takes every call, and only upon request,\n> delivers the accumulated messages … \"”Don’t call us”\" could become the real\n> area code for Southern California.\n\n\"“All Alone by the Telephone”\" has come full circle. It will soon be the\ntelephone that is \"“all alone, and feeling blue.”\"\n\n  *[P.A.]: Public Address\n\n\n![The Phonograph: The Toy that Shrank the National Chest](images/title-28.png)\n\nThe phonograph, which owes its origin to the electrical telegraph and the\ntelephone, had not manifested its basically electric form and function until\nthe tape recorder released it from its mechanical trappings. That the world of\nsound is essentially a unified field of instant relationships lends it a near\nresemblance to the world of electromagnetic waves. This fact brought the\nphonograph and radio into early association.\n\nJust how obliquely the phonograph was at first received is indicated in the\nobservation of John Philip Sousa, the brassband director and composer. He\ncommented: \"“With the phonograph vocal exercises will be out of vogue! Then\nwhat of the national throat? Will it not weaken? What of the national chest?\nWill it not shrink?”\"\n\nOne fact Sousa had grasped: The phonograph is an extension and amplification\nof the voice that may well have diminished individual vocal activity, much as\nthe car had reduced pedestrian activity.\n\nLike the radio that it still provides with program content, the phonograph is\na hot medium. Without it, the twentieth century as the era of tango, ragtime,\nand jazz would have had a different rhythm. But the phonograph was involved in\nmany misconceptions, as one of its early names — gramophone — implies. It was\nconceived as a form of auditory writing (_gramma_ -letters). It was also\ncalled \"“graphophone,”\" with the needle in the role of pen. The idea of it as\na “talking machine” was especially popular. Edison was delayed in his approach\nto the solution of its problems by considering it at first as a \"“telephone\nrepeater”\"; that is, a storehouse of data from the telephone, enabling the\ntelephone to \"“provide invaluable records, instead of being the recipient of\nmomentary and fleeting communication.”\" These words of Edison, published in\nthe North American Review of June, 1878, illustrate how the then recent\ntelephone invention already had the power to color thinking in other fields.\nSo, the record player had to be seen as a kind of phonetic record of telephone\nconversation. Hence, the names “phonograph” and “gramophone.”\n\nBehind the immediate popularity of the phonograph was the entire electric\nimplosion that gave such new stress and importance to actual speech rhythms in\nmusic, poetry, and dance alike. Yet the phonograph was a machine merely. It\ndid not at first use an electric motor or circuit. But in providing a\nmechanical extension of the human voice and the new ragtime melodies, the\nphonograph was propelled into a central place by some of the major currents of\nthe age. The fact of acceptance of a new phrase, or a speech form, or a dance\nrhythm is already direct evidence of some actual development to which it is\nsignificantly related. Take, for example, the shift of English into an\ninterrogative mood, since the arrival of “How about that?” Nothing could\ninduce people to begin suddenly to use such a phrase over and over, unless\nthere was some new stress, rhythm, or nuance in interpersonal relations that\ngave it relevance.\n\nIt was while handling paper tape, impressed by Morse Code dots and dashes,\nthat Edison noticed the sound given off when the tape moved at high speed\nresembled “human talk heard indistinctly.” It then occurred to him that\nindented tape could record a telephone message. Edison became aware of the\nlimits of lineality and the sterility of specialism as soon as he entered the\nelectric field. \"“Look,”\" he said, \"“it’s like this. I start here with the\nintention of reaching here in an experiment, say, to increase the speed of the\nAtlantic cable; but when I’ve arrived part way in my straight line, I meet\nwith a phenomenon, and it leads me off in another direction and develops into\na phonograph.”\" Nothing could more dramatically express the turning point from\nmechanical explosion to electrical implosion. Edison’s own career embodied\nthat very change in our world, and he himself was often caught in the\nconfusion between the two forms of procedure.\n\nIt was just at the end of the nineteenth century that the psychologist Lipps\nrevealed by a kind of electric audiograph that the single clang of a bell was\nan intensive manifold containing all possible symphonies. It was somewhat on\nthe same lines that Edison approached his problems. Practical experience had\ntaught him that embryonically all problems contained all answers when one\ncould discover a means of rendering them explicit. In his own case, his\ndetermination to give the phonograph, like the telephone, a direct practical\nuse in business procedures led to his neglect of the instrument as a means of\nentertainment. Failure to foresee the phonograph as a means of entertainment\nwas really a failure to grasp the meaning of the electric revolution in\ngeneral. In our time we are reconciled to the phonograph as a toy and a\nsolace; but press, radio, and TV have also acquired the same dimension of\nentertainment. Meantime, entertainment pushed to an extreme becomes the main\nform of business and politics. Electric media, because of their total “field”\ncharacter, tend to eliminate the fragmented specialties of form and function\nthat we have long accepted as the heritage of alphabet, printing, and\nmechanization. The brief and compressed history of the phonograph includes all\nphases of the written, the printed, and the mechanized word. It was the advent\nof the electric tape recorder that only a few years ago released the\nphonograph from its temporary involvement in mechanical culture. Tape and the\nLP record suddenly made the phonograph a means of access to all the music and\nspeech of the world.\n\nBefore turning to the LP and tape recording revolution, we should note that\nthe earlier period of mechanical recording and sound reproduction had one\nlarge factor in common with the silent picture. The early phonograph produced\na brisk and raucous experience not unlike that of a Mack Sennett movie. But\nthe undercurrent of mechanical music is strangely sad. It was the genius of\nCharles Chaplin to have captured for film this sagging quality of a deep\nblues, and to have overlaid it with jaunty jive and bounce. The poets and\npainters and musicians of the later nineteenth century all insist on a sort of\nmetaphysical melancholy as latent in the great industrial world of the\nmetropolis. The Pierrot figure is as crucial in the poetry of Laforgue as it\nis in the art of Picasso or the music of Satie. Is not the mechanical at its\nbest a remarkable approximation to the organic? And is not a great industrial\ncivilization able to produce anything in abundance for everybody? The answer\nis “Yes.” But Chaplin and the Pierrot poets and painters and musicians pushed\nthis logic all the way to reach the image of Cyrano de Bergerac, who was the\ngreatest lover of all, but who was never permitted the return of his love.\nThis weird image of Cyrano, the unloved and unlovable lover, was caught up in\nthe phonograph cult of the blues. Perhaps it is misleading to try to derive\nthe origin of the blues from Negro folk music; however, Constant Lambert,\nEnglish conductor-composer, in his Music Ho!, provides an account of the blues\nthat preceded the jazz of the post-World War I. He concludes that the great\nflowering of jazz in the twenties was a popular response to the highbrow\nrichness and orchestral subtlety of the Debussy-Delius period. Jazz would seem\nto be an effective bridge between highbrow and lowbrow music, much as Chaplin\nmade a similar bridge for pictorial art. Literary people eagerly accepted\nthese bridges, and Joyce got Chaplin into Ulysses as Bloom, just as Eliot got\njazz into the rhythms of his early poems.\n\nChaplin’s clown-Cyrano is as much a part of a deep melancholy as Laforgue’s or\nSatie’s Pierrot art. Is it not inherent in the very triumph of the mechanical\nand its omission of the human? Could the mechanical reach a higher level than\nthe talking machine with its mime of voice and dance? Do not T. S. Eliot’s\nfamous lines about the typist of the jazz age capture the entire pathos of the\nage of Chaplin and the ragtime blues?\n\n> When lovely woman stoops to folly and\n>\n> Paces about her room again, alone,\n>\n> She smoothes her hair with automatic hand,\n>\n> And puts a record on the gramophone.\n\nRead as a Chaplin-like comedy, Eliot’s Prufrock makes ready sense. Prufrock is\nthe complete Pierrot, the little puppet of the mechanical civilization that\nwas about to do a flip into its electric phase.\n\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of complex mechanical forms\nsuch as film and phonograph as the prelude to the automation of human song and\ndance. As this automation of human voice and gesture had approached\nperfection, so the human work force approached automation. Now in the electric\nage the assembly line with its human hands disappears, and electric automation\nbrings about a withdrawal of the work force from industry. Instead of being\nautomated themselves — fragmented in task and function — as had been the\ntendency under mechanization, men in the electric age move increasingly to\ninvolvement in diverse jobs simultaneously, and to the work of learning, and\nto the programming of computers.\n\nThis revolutionary logic inherent in the electric age was made fairly clear in\nthe early electric forms of telegraph and telephone that inspired the “talking\nmachine.” These new forms that did so much to recover the vocal, auditory, and\nmimetic world that had been repressed by the printed word, also inspired the\nstrange new rhythms of “the jazz age,” the various forms of syncopation and\nsymbolist discontinuity that, like relativity and quantum physics, heralded\nthe end of the Gutenberg era with its smooth, uniform lines of type and\norganization.\n\nThe word “jazz” comes from the French _jaser_ , to chatter. Jazz is, indeed, a\nform of dialogue among instrumentalists and dancers alike. Thus it seemed to\nmake an abrupt break with the homogeneous and repetitive rhythms of the smooth\nwaltz. In the age of Napoleon and Lord Byron, when the waltz was a new form,\nit was greeted as a barbaric fulfillment of the Rousseauistic dream of the\nnoble savage. Grotesque as this idea now appears, it is really a most valuable\nclue to the dawning mechanical age. The impersonal choral-dancing of the\nolder, courtly pattern was abandoned when the waltzers held each other in a\npersonal embrace. The waltz is precise, mechanical, and military, as its\nhistory manifests. For a waltz to yield its full meaning, there must be\nmilitary dress. \"“There was a sound of revelry by night”\" was how Lord Byron\nreferred to the waltzing before Waterloo. To the eighteenth century and to the\nage of Napoleon, the citizen armies seemed to be an individualistic release\nfrom the feudal framework of courtly hierarchies. Hence the association of\nwaltz with noble savage, meaning no more than freedom from status and\nhierarchic deference. The waltzers were all uniform and equal, having free\nmovement in any part of the hall. That this was the Romantic idea of the life\nof the noble savage now seems odd, but the Romantics knew as little about real\nsavages as they did about assembly lines.\n\nIn our own century the arrival of jazz and ragtime was also heralded as the\ninvasion of the bottom-wagging native. The indignant tended to appeal from\njazz to the beauty of the mechanical and repetitive waltz that had once been\ngreeted as pure native dancing. If jazz is considered as a break with\nmechanism in the direction of the discontinuous, the participant, the\nspontaneous and improvisational, it can also be seen as a return to a sort of\noral poetry in which performance is both creation and composition. It is a\ntruism among jazz performers that recorded jazz is \"“as stale as yesterday’s\nnewspaper.”\" Jazz is alive, like conversation; and like conversation it\ndepends upon a repertory of available themes. But performance is composition.\nSuch performance insures maximal participation among players and dancers\nalike. Put in this way, it becomes obvious at once that jazz belongs in that\nfamily of mosaic structures that reappeared in the Western world with the wire\nservices. It belongs with symbolism in poetry, and with the many allied forms\nin painting and in music.\n\nThe bond between the phonograph and song and dance is no less deep than its\nearlier relation to telegraph and telephone. With the first printing of\nmusical scores in the sixteenth century, words and music drifted apart. The\nseparate virtuosity of voice and instruments became the basis of the great\nmusical developments of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The same kind\nof fragmentation and specialism in the arts and sciences made possible mammoth\nresults in industry and in military enterprise, and in massive cooperative\nenterprises such as the newspaper and symphony orchestra.\n\nCertainly the phonograph as a product of industrial, assembly-line\norganization and distribution showed little of the electric qualities that had\ninspired its growth in the mind of Edison. There were prophets who could\nforesee the great day when the phonograph would aid medicine by providing a\nmedical means of discrimination between \"“the sob of hysteria and the sigh of\nmelancholia … the ring of whooping cough and the hack of the consumptive. It\nwill be an expert in insanity, distinguishing between the laugh of the maniac\nand the drivel of the idiot … It will accomplish this feat in the anteroom,\nwhile the physician is busying himself with his last patient.”\" In practice,\nhowever, the phonograph stayed with the voices of the Signor Foghornis, the\nbasso-tenores, robusto-profundos.\n\nRecording facilities did not presume to touch anything so subtle as an\norchestra until after the First War. Long before this, one enthusiast looked\nto the record to rival the photograph album and to hasten the happy day when\n\"“future generations will be able to condense within the space of twenty\nminutes a tone-picture of a single lifetime: five minutes of a child’s\nprattle, five of the boy’s exultations, five of the man’s reflections, and\nfive from the feeble utterances of the deathbed.”\" James Joyce, somewhat\nlater, did better. He made Finnegans Wake a tone poem that condensed in a\nsingle sentence all the prattlings, exultations, observations, and remorse of\nthe entire human race. He could not have conceived this work in any other age\nthan the one that produced the phonograph and the radio.\n\nIt was radio that finally injected a full electric charge into the world of\nthe phonograph. The radio receiver of 1924 was already superior in sound\nquality, and soon began to depress the phonograph and record business.\nEventually, radio restored the record business by extending popular taste in\nthe direction of the classics.\n\nThe real break came after the Second War with the availability of the tape\nrecorder. This meant the end of the incision recording and its attendant\nsurface noise. In 1949 the era of electric hi-fi was another rescuer of the\nphonograph business. The hi-fi quest for “realistic sound” soon merged with\nthe TV image as part of the recovery of tactile experience. For the sensation\nof having the performing instruments \"“right in the room with you”\" is a\nstriving toward the union of the audile and tactile in a finesse of fiddles\nthat is in large degree the sculptural experience. To be in the presence of\nperforming musicians is to experience their touch and handling of instruments\nas tactile and kinetic, not just as resonant. So it can be said that hi-fi is\nnot any quest for abstract effects of sound in separation from the other\nsenses. With hi-fi, the phonograph meets the TV tactile challenge.\n\nStereo sound, a further development, is “all-around” or “wrap-around” sound.\nPreviously sound had emanated from a single point in accordance with the bias\nof visual culture with its fixed point of view. The hi-fi changeover was\nreally for music what cubism had been for painting, and what symbolism had\nbeen for literature; namely, the acceptance of multiple facets and planes in a\nsingle experience. Another way to put it is to say that stereo is sound in\ndepth, as TV is the visual in depth.\n\nPerhaps it is not very contradictory that when a medium becomes a means of\ndepth experience the old categories of “classical” and “popular” or of\n“highbrow” and “lowbrow” no longer obtain. Watching a blue-baby heart\noperation on TV is an experience that will fit none of the categories. When LP\nand hi-fi and stereo arrived, a depth approach to musical experience also came\nin. Everybody lost his inhibitions about “highbrow,” and the serious people\nlost their qualms about popular music and culture. Anything that is approached\nin depth acquires as much interest as the greatest matters. Because “depth”\nmeans “in interrelation,” not in isolation. Depth means insight, not point of\nview; and insight is a kind of mental involvement in process that makes the\ncontent of the item seem quite secondary. Consciousness itself is an inclusive\nprocess not at all dependent on content. Consciousness does not postulate\nconsciousness of anything in particular.\n\nWith regard to jazz, LP brought many changes, such as the cult of “real cool\ndrool,” because the greatly increased length of a single side of a disk meant\nthat the jazz band could really have a long and casual chat among its\ninstruments. The repertory of the 1920s was revived and given new depth and\ncomplexity by this new means. But the tape recorder in combination with LP\nrevolutionized the repertory of classical music. Just as tape meant the new\nstudy of spoken rather than written languages, so it brought in the entire\nmusical culture of many centuries and countries. Where before there had been a\nnarrow selection from periods and composers, the tape recorder, combined with\nLP, gave a full musical spectrum that made the sixteenth century as available\nas the nineteenth, and Chinese folk song as accessible as the Hungarian.\n\nA brief summary of technological events relating to the phonograph might go\nthis way:\n\nThe telegraph translated writing into sound, a fact directly related to the\norigin of both the telephone and phonograph. With the telegraph, the only\nwalls left are the vernacular walls that the photograph and movie and\nwirephoto overleap so easily. The electrification of writing was almost as big\na step into the nonvisual and auditory space as the later steps soon taken by\ntelephone, radio, and TV.\n\n> The telephone: speech without walls.\n>\n> The phonograph: music hall without walls.\n>\n> The photograph: museum without walls.\n>\n> The electric light: space without walls\n>\n> The movie, radio, and TV: classroom without walls.\n\nMan the food-gatherer reappears incongruously as information-gatherer. In this\nrole, electronic man is no less a nomad than his paleolithic ancestors.\n\n  *[LP]: Long Play\n\n\n![Movies: The Reel World](images/title-29.png)\n\nIn England the movie theater was originally called “The Bioscope,” because of\nits visual presentation of the actual movements of the forms of life (from\nGreek _bios_ , way of life). The movie, by which we roll up the real world on\na spool in order to unroll it as a magic carpet of fantasy, is a spectacular\nwedding of the old mechanical technology and the new electric world. In the\nchapter on The Wheel, the story was told of how the movie had a kind of\nsymbolic origin in an attempt to photograph the flying hooves of galloping\nhorses, for to set a series of cameras to study animal movement is to merge\nthe mechanical and the organic in a special way. In the medieval world,\ncuriously, the idea of change in organic beings was that of the substitution\nof one static form for another, in sequence. They imagined the life of a\nflower as a kind of cinematic strip of phases or essences. The movie is the\ntotal realization of the medieval idea of change, in the form of an\nentertaining illusion. Physiologists had very much to do with the development\nof film, as they did with the telephone. On film the mechanical appears as\norganic, and the growth of a flower can be portrayed as easily and as freely\nas the movement of a horse.\n\nIf the movie merges the mechanical and organic in a world of undulating forms,\nit also links with the technology of print. The reader in projecting words, as\nit were, has to follow the black and white sequences of stills that is\ntypography, providing his own sound track. He tries to follow the contours of\nthe author’s mind, at varying speeds and with various illusions of\nunderstanding. It would be difficult to exaggerate the bond between print and\nmovie in terms of their power to generate fantasy in the viewer or reader.\nCervantes devoted his Don Quixote entirely to this aspect of the printed word\nand its power to create what James Joyce throughout Finnegans Wake designates\nas \"“the ABCED-minded,”\" which can be taken as “ab-said” or “ab-sent,” or just\nalphabetically controlled.\n\nThe business of the writer or the film-maker is to transfer the reader or\nviewer from one world, his own, to another, the world created by typography\nand film. That is so obvious, and happens so completely, that those undergoing\nthe experience accept it subliminally and without critical awareness.\nCervantes lived in a world in which print was as new as movies are in the\nWest, and it seemed obvious to him that print, like the images now on the\nscreen, had usurped the real world. The reader or spectator had become a\ndreamer under their spell, as René Clair said of film in 1926.\n\nMovies as a nonverbal form of experience are like photography, a form of\nstatement without syntax. In fact, however, like the print and the photo,\nmovies assume a high level of literacy in their users and prove baffling to\nthe nonliterate. Our literate acceptance of the mere movement of the camera\neye as it follows or drops a figure from view is not acceptable to an African\nfilm audience. If somebody disappears off the side of the film, the African\nwants to know what happened to him. A literate audience, however, accustomed\nto following printed imagery line by line without questioning the logic of\nlineality, will accept film sequence without protest.\n\nIt was René Clair who pointed out that if two or three people were together on\na stage, the dramatist must ceaselessly motivate or explain their being there\nat all. But the film audience, like the book reader, accepts mere sequence as\nrational. Whatever the camera turns to, the audience accepts. We are\ntransported to another world. As René Clair observed, the screen opens its\nwhite door into a harem of beautiful visions and adolescent dreams, compared\nto which the loveliest real body seems defective. Yeats saw the movie as a\nworld of Platonic ideals with the film projector playing \"“a spume upon a\nghostly paradigm of things.”\" This was the world that haunted Don Quixote, who\nfound it through the folio door of the newly printed romances.\n\nThe close relation, then, between the reel world of film and the private\nfantasy experience of the printed word is indispensable to our Western\nacceptance of the film form. Even the film industry regards all of its\ngreatest achievements as derived from novels, nor is this unreasonable. Film,\nboth in its reel form and in its scenario or script form, is completely\ninvolved with book culture. All one need do is to imagine for a moment a film\nbased on newspaper form in order to see how close film is to book.\nTheoretically, there is no reason why the camera should not be used to\nphotograph complex groups of items and events in dateline configurations, just\nas they are presented on the page of a newspaper. Actually, poetry tends to do\nthis configuring or “bunching” more than prose. Symbolist poetry has much in\ncommon with the mosaic of the newspaper page, yet very few people can detach\nthemselves from uniform and connected space sufficiently to grasp symbolist\npoems. Natives, on the other hand, who have very little contact with phonetic\nliteracy and lineal print, have to learn to “see” photographs or film just as\nmuch as we have to learn our letters. In fact, after having tried for years to\nteach Africans their letters by film, John Wilson of London University’s\nAfrican Institute found it easier to teach them their letters as a means to\nfilm literacy. For even when natives have learned to “see” pictures, they\ncannot accept our ideas of time and space “illusions.” On seeing Charlie\nChaplin’s The Tramp, the African audience concluded that Europeans were\nmagicians who could restore life. They saw a character who survived a mighty\nblow on the head without any indication of being hurt. When the camera shifts,\nthey think they see trees moving, and buildings growing or shrinking, because\nthey cannot make the literate assumption that space is continuous and uniform.\nNonliterate people simply don’t get perspective or distancing effects of light\nand shade that we assume are innate human equipment. Literate people think of\ncause and effect as sequential, as if one thing pushed another along by\nphysical force. Nonliterate people register very little interest in this kind\nof “efficient” cause and effect, but are fascinated by hidden forms that\nproduce magical results. Inner, rather than outer, causes interest the\nnonliterate and nonvisual cultures. And that is why the literate West sees the\nrest of the world as caught in the seamless web of superstition.\n\nLike the oral Russian, the African will not accept sight and sound together.\nThe talkies were the doom of Russian film-making because, like any backward or\noral culture, Russians have an irresistible need for participation that is\ndefeated by the addition of sound to the visual image. Both Pudovkin and\nEisenstein denounced the sound film but considered that if sound were used\nsymbolically and contrapuntally, rather than realistically, there would result\nless harm to the visual image. The African insistence on group participation\nand on chanting and shouting during films is wholly frustrated by sound track.\nOur own talkies were a further completion of the visual package as a mere\nconsumer commodity. For with silent film we automatically provide sound for\nourselves by way of “closure” or completion. And when it is filled in for us\nthere is very much less participation in the work of the image.\n\nAgain, it has been found that nonliterates do not know how to fix their eyes,\nas Westerners do, a few feet in front of the movie screen, or some distance in\nfront of a photo. The result is that they move their eyes over photo or screen\nas they might their hands. It is this same habit of using the eyes as hands\nthat makes European men so “sexy” to American women. Only an extremely\nliterate and abstract society learns to fix the eyes, as we must learn to do\nin reading the printed page. For those who thus fix their eyes, perspective\nresults. There is great subtlety and synesthesia in native art, but no\nperspective. The old belief that everybody really saw in perspective, but only\nthat Renaissance painters had learned how to paint it, is erroneous. Our own\nfirst TV generation is rapidly losing this habit of visual perspective as a\nsensory modality, and along with this change comes an interest in words, not\nas visually uniform and continuous, but as unique worlds in depth. Hence the\ncraze for puns and word-play, even in sedate ads.\n\nIn terms of other media such as the printed page, film has the power to store\nand to convey a great deal of information. In an instant it presents a scene\nof landscape with figures that would require several pages of prose to\ndescribe. In the next instant it repeats, and can go on repeating, this\ndetailed information. The writer, on the other hand, has no means of holding a\nmass of detail before his reader in a large bloc or _gestalt_. As the\nphotograph urged the painter in the direction of abstract, sculptural art, so\nthe film has confirmed the writer in verbal economy and depth symbolism where\nthe film cannot rival him.\n\nAnother facet of the sheer quantity of data possible in a movie shot is\nexemplified in historical films like Henry V or Richard III. Here extensive\nresearch went into the making of the sets and costumes that any six-year-old\ncan now enjoy as readily as any adult. T. S. Eliot reported how, in the making\nof the film of his Murder in the Cathedral, it was not only necessary to have\ncostumes of the period, but — so great is the precision and tyranny of the\ncamera eye — these costumes had to be woven by the same techniques as those\nused in the twelfth century. Hollywood, amidst much illusion, had also to\nprovide authentic scholarly replicas of many past scenes. The stage and TV can\nmake do with very rough approximations, because they offer an image of low\ndefinition that evades detailed scrutiny.\n\nAt first, however, it was the detailed realism of writers like Dickens that\ninspired movie pioneers like D. W. Griffith, who carried a copy of a Dickens\nnovel on location. The realistic novel, that arose with the newspaper form of\ncommunal cross-section and human-interest coverage in the eighteenth century,\nwas a complete anticipation of film form. Even the poets took up the same\npanoramic style, with human interest vignettes and close-ups as variant.\nGray’s Elegy, Burns’ The Cotter’s Saturday Night, Wordsworth’s Michael, and\nByron’s Childe Harold are all like shooting scripts for some contemporary\ndocumentary film.\n\n\"“The kettle began it …”\" Such is the opening of Dickens’ The Cricket on the\nHearth. If the modern novel came out of Gogol’s The Overcoat, the modern\nmovie, says Eisenstein, boiled up out of that kettle. It should be plain that\nthe American and even British approach to film is much lacking in that free\ninterplay among the senses and the media that seems so natural to Eisenstein\nor René Clair. For the Russian, especially, it is easy to approach any\nsituation structurally, which is to say, sculpturally. To Eisenstein, the\noverwhelming fact of film was that it is an \"“act of juxtaposition.”\" But to a\nculture in an extreme reach of typographic conditioning, the juxtaposition\nmust be one of uniform and connected characters and qualities. There must be\nno leaps from the unique space of the tea kettle to the unique space of the\nkitten or the boot. If such objects appear, they must be leveled off by some\ncontinuous narrative, or be “contained” in some uniform pictorial space. All\nthat Salvador Dali had to do to create a furor was to allow the chest of\ndrawers or the grand piano to exist in its own space against some Sahara or\nAlpine backdrop. Merely by releasing objects from the uniform continuous space\nof typography we got modern art and poetry. We can measure the psychic\npressure of typography by the uproar generated by that release. For most\npeople, their own ego image seems to have been typographically conditioned, so\nthat the electric age with its return to inclusive experience threatens their\nidea of self. These are the fragmented ones, for whom specialist toil renders\nthe mere prospect of leisure or jobless security a nightmare. Electric\nsimultaneity ends specialist learning and activity, and demands interrelation\nin depth, even of the personality.\n\nThe case of Charlie Chaplin films helps to illumine this problem. His Modern\nTimes was taken to be a satire on the fragmented character of modern tasks. As\nclown, Chaplin presents the acrobatic feat in a mime of elaborate\nincompetence, for any specialist task leaves out most of our faculties. The\nclown reminds us of our fragmented state by tackling acrobatic or special jobs\nin the spirit of the whole or integral man. This is the formula for helpless\nincompetence. On the street, in social situations, on the assembly line, the\nworker continues his compulsive twitchings with an imagery wrench. But the\nmime of this Chaplin film and others is precisely that of the robot, the\nmechanical doll whose deep pathos it is to approximate so closely to the\ncondition of human life. Chaplin, in all his work, did a puppetlike ballet of\nthe Cyrano de Bergerac kind. In order to capture this puppetlike pathos,\nChaplin (a devotee of ballet and a personal friend of Pavlova), adopted from\nthe first the foot postures of classical ballet. Thus he could have the aura\nof Spectre de la Rose shimmering around his clown getup. From the British\nmusic hall, his first training ground, with a sure touch of genius he took\nimages like that of Mr. Charles Pooter, the haunting figure of a nobody. This\nshoddy-genteel image he invested with an envelope of fairy romance by means of\nadherence to the classic ballet postures. The new film form was perfectly\nadapted to this composite image, since film is itself a jerky mechanical\nballet of flicks that yields a sheer dream world of romantic illusions. But\nthe film form is not just a puppetlike dance of arrested still shots, for it\nmanages to approximate and even to surpass real life by means of illusion.\nThat is why Chaplin, in his silent pictures at least, was never tempted to\nabandon the Cyrano role of the puppet who could never really be a lover. In\nthis stereotype Chaplin discovered the heart of the film illusion, and he\nmanipulated that heart with easy mastery, as the key to the pathos of a\nmechanized civilization. A mechanized world is always in the process of\ngetting ready to live, and to this end it brings to bear the most appalling\npomp of skill and method and resourcefulness.\n\nThe film pushed this mechanism to the utmost mechanical verge and beyond, into\na surrealism of dreams that money can buy. Nothing is more congenial to the\nfilm form than this pathos of superabundance and power that is the dower of a\npuppet for whom they can never be real. This is the key to The Great Gatsby\nthat reaches its moment of truth when Daisy breaks down in contemplating\nGatsby’s superb collection of shirts. Daisy and Gatsby live in a tinsel world\nthat is both corrupted by power, yet innocently pastoral in its dreaming.\n\nThe movie is not only a supreme expression of mechanism, but paradoxically it\noffers as product the most magical of consumer commodities, namely dreams. It\nis, therefore, not accidental that the movie has excelled as a medium that\noffers poor people roles of riches and power beyond the dreams of avarice. In\nthe chapter on The Photograph, it was pointed out how the press photo in\nparticular had discouraged the really rich from the paths of conspicuous\nconsumption. The life of display that the photo had taken from the rich, the\nmovie gave to the poor with lavish hand:\n\n> Oh lucky, lucky me,\n>\n> I shall live in luxury,\n>\n> For I’ve got a pocketful of dreams.\n\nThe Hollywood tycoons were not wrong in acting on the assumption that movies\ngave the American immigrant a means of self-fulfillment without any delay.\nThis strategy, however deplorable in the light of the “absolute ideal good,”\nwas perfectly in accord with film form. It meant that in the 1920s the\nAmerican way of life was exported to the entire world in cans. The world\neagerly lined up to buy canned dreams. The film not only accompanied the first\ngreat consumer age, but was also incentive, advertisement and, in itself, a\nmajor commodity. Now in terms of media study it is clear that the power of\nfilm to store information in accessible form is unrivaled. Audio tape and\nvideo tape were to excel film eventually as information storehouses. But film\nremains a major information resource, a rival of the book whose technology it\ndid so much to continue and also to surpass. At the present time, film is\nstill in its manuscript phase, as it were; shortly it will, under TV pressure,\ngo into its portable, accessible, printed-book phase. Soon everyone will be\nable to have a small, inexpensive film projector that plays an 8-mm sound\ncartridge as if on a TV screen. This type of development is part of our\npresent technological implosion. The present dissociation of projector and\nscreen is a vestige of our older mechanical world of explosion and separation\nof functions that is now ending with the electrical implosion.\n\nTypographic man took readily to film just because, like books, it offers an\ninward world of fantasy and dreams. The film viewer sits in psychological\nsolitude like the silent book reader. This was not the case with the\nmanuscript reader, nor is it true of the watcher of television. It is not\npleasant to turn on TV just for oneself in a hotel room, nor even at home. The\nTV mosaic image demands social completion and dialogue. So with the manuscript\nbefore typography, since manuscript culture is oral and demands dialogue and\ndebate, as the entire culture of the ancient and medieval worlds demonstrates.\nOne of the major pressures of TV has been to encourage the “teaching machine.”\nIn fact, these devices are adaptations of the book in the direction of\ndialogue. These teaching machines are really private tutors, and their being\nmisnamed on the principle that produced the names “wireless” and “horseless\ncarriage” is another instance in that long list that illustrates how every\ninnovation must pass through a primary phase in which the new effect is\nsecured by the old method, amplified or modified by some new feature.\n\nFilm is not really a single medium like song or the written word, but a\ncollective art form with different individuals directing color, lighting,\nsound, acting, speaking. The press, radio and TV, and the comics are also art\nforms dependent upon entire teams and hierarchies of skill in corporate\naction. Prior to the movies, the most obvious example of such corporate\nartistic action had occurred early in the industrialized world, with the large\nnew symphony orchestras of the nineteenth century. Paradoxically, as industry\nwent its ever more specialized fragmented course, it demanded more and more\nteamwork in sales and supplies. The symphony orchestra became a major\nexpression of the ensuing power of such coordinated effort, though for the\nplayers themselves this effect was lost, both in the symphony and in industry.\n\nWhen the magazine editors recently introduced film scenario procedures to the\nconstructing of idea articles, the idea article supplanted the short story.\nThe film is the rival of the book in that sense. (TV in turn is the rival of\nthe magazine because of its mosaic power.) Ideas presented as a sequence of\nshots or pictorialized situations, almost in the manner of a teaching machine,\nactually drove the short story out of the magazine field.\n\nHollywood has fought TV mainly by becoming a subsidiary of TV. Most of the\nfilm industry is now engaged in supplying TV programs. But one new strategy\nhas been tried, namely the big-budget picture. The fact is that Technicolor is\nthe closest the movie can get to the effect of the TV image. Technicolor\ngreatly lowers photographic intensity and creates, in part, the visual\nconditions for participant viewing. Had Hollywood understood the reasons for\nMarty’s success, TV might have given us a revolution in film. Marty was a TV\nshow that got onto the screen in the form of low definition or low-intensity\nvisual realism. It was not a success story, and it had no stars, because the\nlow-intensity TV image is quite incompatible with the high-intensity star\nimage. Marty, which in fact looked like an early silent movie or an old\nRussian picture, offered the film industry all the clues it needed for meeting\nthe TV challenge.\n\nThis kind of casual, cool realism has given the new British films easy\nascendancy. Room at the Top features the new cool realism. Not only is it not\na success story, it is as much an announcement of the end of the Cinderella\npackage as Marilyn Monroe was the end of the star system. Room at the Top is\nthe story of how the higher a monkey climbs, the more you see of his backside.\nThe moral is that success is not only wicked but also the formula for misery.\nIt is very hard for a hot medium like film to accept the cool message of TV.\nBut the Peter Sellers movies I’m All Right, Jack and Only Two Can Play are\nperfectly in tune with the new temper created by the cool TV image. Such is\nalso the meaning of the ambiguous success of Lolita. As a novel, its\nacceptance announced the antiheroic approach to romance. The film industry had\nlong beaten out a royal road to romance in keeping with the crescendo of the\nsuccess story. Lolita announced that the royal road was only a cowtrack, after\nall, and as for success, it shouldn’t happen to a dog.\n\nIn the ancient world and in medieval times, the most popular of all stories\nwere those dealing with The Falls of Princes. With the coming of the very hot\nprint medium, the preference changed to a rising rhythm and to tales of\nsuccess and sudden elevation in the world. It seemed possible to achieve\nanything by the new typographic method of minute, uniform segmentation of\nproblems. It was by this method, eventually, that film was made. Film was, as\na form, the final fulfillment of the great potential of typographic\nfragmentation. But the electric implosion has now reversed the entire process\nof expansion by fragmentation. Electricity has brought back the cool, mosaic\nworld of implosion, equilibrium, and stasis. In our electric age, the one-way\nexpansion of the berserk individual on his way to the top now appears as a\ngruesome image of trampled lives and disrupted harmonies. Such is the\nsubliminal message of the TV mosaic with its total field of simultaneous\nimpulses. Film strip and sequence cannot but bow to this superior power. Our\nown youngsters have taken the TV message to heart in their beatnik rejection\nof consumer mores and of the private success story.\n\nSince the best way to get to the core of a form is to study its effect in some\nunfamiliar setting, let us note what President Sukarno of Indonesia announced\nin 1956 to a large group of Hollywood executives. He said that he regarded\nthem as political radicals and revolutionaries who had greatly hastened\npolitical change in the East. What the Orient saw in a Hollywood movie was a\nworld in which all the _ordinary people_ had cars and electric stoves and\nrefrigerators. So the Oriental now regards himself as an ordinary person who\nhas been deprived of the ordinary man’s birthright.\n\nThat is another way of getting a view of the film medium as monster ad for\nconsumer goods. In America this major aspect of film is merely subliminal. Far\nfrom regarding our pictures as incentives to mayhem and revolution, we take\nthem as solace and compensation, or as a form of deferred payment by\ndaydreaming. But the Oriental is right, and we are wrong about this. In fact,\nthe movie is a mighty limb of the industrial giant. That it is being amputated\nby the TV image reflects a still greater revolution going on at the center of\nAmerican life. It is natural that the ancient East should feel the political\npull and industrial challenge of our movie industry. The movie, as much as the\nalphabet and the printed word, is an aggressive and imperial form that\nexplodes outward into other cultures. Its explosive force was significantly\ngreater in silent pictures than in talkies, for the electromagnetic sound\ntrack already forecast the substitution of electric implosion for mechanical\nexplosion. The silent pictures were immediately acceptable across language\nbarriers as the talkies were not. Radio teamed up with film to give us the\ntalkie and to carry us further on our present reverse course of implosion or\nre-integration after the mechanical age of explosion and expansion. The\nextreme form of this implosion or contraction is the image of the astronaut\nlocked into his wee bit of wrap-around space. Far from enlarging our world, he\nis announcing its contraction to village size. The rocket and the space\ncapsule are ending the rule of the wheel and the machine, as much as did the\nwire services, radio, and TV.\n\nWe may now consider a further instance of the film’s influence in a most\nconclusive aspect. In modern literature there is probably no more celebrated\ntechnique than that of the stream of consciousness or interior monologue.\nWhether in Proust, Joyce, or Eliot, this form of sequence permits the reader\nan extraordinary identification with personalities of the utmost range and\ndiversity. The stream of consciousness is really managed by the transfer of\nfilm technique to the printed page, where, in a deep sense it really\noriginated; for as we have seen, the Gutenberg technology of movable types is\nquite indispensable to any industrial or film process. As much as the\ninfinitesimal calculus that _pretends_ to deal with motion and change by\nminute fragmentation, the film does so by making motion and change into a\nseries of static shots. Print does likewise while pretending to deal with the\nwhole mind in action. Yet film and the stream of consciousness alike seemed to\nprovide a deeply desired release from the mechanical world of increasing\nstandardization and uniformity. Nobody ever felt oppressed by the monotony or\nuniformity of the Chaplin ballet or by the monotonous, uniform musings of his\nliterary twin, Leopold Bloom.\n\nIn 1911 Henri Bergson in Creative Evolution created a sensation by associating\nthe thought process with the form of the movie. Just at the extreme point of\nmechanization represented by the factory, the film, and the press, men seemed\nby the stream of consciousness, or interior film to obtain release into a\nworld of spontaneity, of dreams, and of unique personal experience. Dickens\nperhaps began it all with his Mr. Jingle in Pickwick Papers. Certainly in\nDavid Copperfield he made a great technical discovery, since for the first\ntime the world unfolds realistically through the use of the eyes of a growing\nchild as camera. Here was the stream of consciousness, perhaps, in its\noriginal form before it was adopted by Proust and Joyce and Eliot. It\nindicates how the enrichment of human experience can occur unexpectedly with\nthe crossing and interplay of the life of media forms.\n\nThe film imports of all nations, especially those from the United States, are\nvery popular in Thailand, thanks in part to a deft Thai technique for getting\nround the foreign-language obstacle. In Bangkok, in place of subtitles, they\nuse what is called “Adam-and-Eving.” This takes the form of live Thai dialogue\nread through a loudspeaker by Thai actors concealed from the audience. Split-\nsecond timing and great endurance enable these actors to demand more than the\nbest-paid movie stars of Thailand.\n\nEveryone has at some time wished he were equipped with his own sound system\nduring a movie performance, in order to make appropriate comments. In\nThailand, one might achieve great heights of interpretive interpolation during\nthe inane exchanges of great stars.\n\n\n![Radio: The Tribal Drum](images/title-30.png)\n\nEngland and America had had their “shots” against radio in the form of long\nexposure to literacy and industrialism. These forms involve an intense visual\norganization of experience. The more earthy and less visual European cultures\nwere not immune to radio. Its tribal magic was not lost on them, and the old\nweb of kinship began to resonate once more with the note of fascism. The\ninability of literate people to grasp the language and message of the media as\nsuch is involuntarily conveyed by the comments of sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld\nin discussing the effects of radio:\n\n> The last group of effects may be called the monopolistic effects of radio.\n> Such have attracted most public attention because of their importance in the\n> totalitarian countries. If a government monopolizes the radio, then by mere\n> repetition and by exclusion of conflicting points of view it can determine\n> the opinions of the population. We do not know much about how this\n> monopolistic effect really works, but it is important to note its\n> singularity. No inference should be drawn regarding the effects of radio as\n> such. It is often forgotten that Hitler did not achieve control through\n> radio but almost despite it, because at the time of his rise to power radio\n> was controlled by his enemies. The monopolistic effects have probably less\n> social importance than is generally assumed.\n\nProfessor Lazarsfeld’s helpless unawareness of the nature and effects of radio\nis not a personal defect, but a universally shared ineptitude.\n\nIn a radio speech in Munich, March 14, 1936, Hitler said, \"“I go my way with\nthe assurance of a somnambulist.”\" His victims and his critics have been\nequally somnambulistic. They danced entranced to the tribal drum of radio that\nextended their central nervous system to create depth involvement for\neverybody. \"“I live right inside radio when I listen. I more easily lose\nmyself in radio than in a book,”\" said a voice from a radio poll. The power of\nradio to involve people in depth is manifested in its use during homework by\nyoungsters and by many other people who carry transistor sets in order to\nprovide a private world for themselves amidst crowds. There is a little poem\nby the German dramatist Berthold Brecht:\n\n> You little box, held to me when escaping\n>\n> So that your valves should not break,\n>\n> Carried from house to ship from ship to train,\n>\n> So that my enemies might go on talking to me\n>\n> Near my bed, to my pain\n>\n> The last thing at night, the first thing in the morning,\n>\n> Of their victories and of my cares,\n>\n> Promise me not to go silent all of a sudden.\n\nOne of the many effects of television on radio has been to shift radio from an\nentertainment medium into a kind of nervous information system. News\nbulletins, time signals, traffic data, and, above all, weather reports now\nserve to enhance the native power of radio to involve people in one another.\nWeather is that medium that involves all people equally. It is the top item on\nradio, showering us with fountains of auditory space or _lebensraum_.\n\nIt was no accident that Senator McCarthy lasted such a very short time when he\nswitched to TV. Soon the press decided, \"“He isn’t news anymore.”\" Neither\nMcCarthy nor the press ever knew what had happened. TV is a cool medium. It\nrejects hot figures and hot issues and people from the hot press media. Fred\nAllen was a casualty of TV. Was Marilyn Monroe? Had TV occurred on a large\nscale during Hitler’s reign he would have vanished quickly. Had TV come first\nthere would have been no Hitler at all. When Khrushchev appeared on American\nTV he was more acceptable than Nixon, as a clown and a lovable sort of old\nboy. His appearance is rendered by TV as a comic cartoon. Radio, however, is a\nhot medium and takes cartoon characters seriously. Mr. K. on radio would be a\ndifferent proposition.\n\nIn the Kennedy-Nixon debates, those who heard them on radio received an\noverwhelming idea of Nixon’s superiority. It was Nixon’s fate to provide a\nsharp, high-definition image and action for the cool TV medium that translated\nthat sharp image into the impression of a phony. I suppose “phony” is\nsomething that resonates wrong, that doesn’t ring true. It might well be that\nF.D.R. would not have done well on TV. He had learned, at least, how to use\nthe hot radio medium for his very cool job of fireside chatting. He first,\nhowever, had had to hot up the press media against himself in order to create\nthe right atmosphere for his radio chats. He learned how to use the press in\nclose relation to radio. TV would have presented him with an entirely\ndifferent political and social mix of components and problems. He would\npossibly have enjoyed solving them, for he had the kind of playful approach\nnecessary for tackling new and obscure relationships.\n\nRadio affects most people intimately, person-to-person, offering a world of\nunspoken communication between writer-speaker and listener. That is the\nimmediate aspect of radio. A private experience. The subliminal depths of\nradio are charged with the resonating echoes of tribal horns and antique\ndrums. This is inherent in the very nature of this medium, with its power to\nturn the psyche and society into a single echo chamber. The resonating\ndimension of radio is unheeded by the script writers, with few exceptions. The\nfamous Orson Welles broadcast about the invasion from Mars was a simple\ndemonstration of the all-inclusive, completely involving scope of the auditory\nimage of radio. It was Hitler who gave radio the Orson Welles treatment for\n_real_.\n\nThat Hitler came into political existence at all is directly owing to radio\nand public-address systems. This is not to say that these media relayed his\nthoughts effectively to the German people. His thoughts were of very little\nconsequence. Radio provided the first massive experience of electronic\nimplosion, that reversal of the entire direction and meaning of literate\nWestern civilization. For tribal peoples, for those whose entire social\nexistence is an extension of family life, radio will continue to be a violent\nexperience. Highly literate societies, that have long subordinated family life\nto individualist stress in business and politics, have managed to absorb and\nto neutralize the radio implosion without revolution. Not so, those\ncommunities that have had only brief or superficial experience of literacy.\nFor them, radio is utterly explosive.\n\nTo understand such effects, it is necessary to see literacy as typographic\ntechnology, applied not only to the rationalizing of the entire procedures of\nproduction and marketing, but to law and education and city planning, as well.\nThe principles of continuity, uniformity, and repeatability derived from print\ntechnology have, in England and America, long permeated every phase of\ncommunal life. In those areas a child learns literacy from traffic and street,\nfrom every car and toy and garment. Learning to read and write is a minor\nfacet of literacy in the uniform, continuous environments of the English-\nspeaking world. Stress on literacy is a distinguishing mark of areas that are\nstriving to initiate that process of standardization that leads to the visual\norganization of work and space. Without psychic transformation of the inner\nlife into segmented visual terms by literacy, there cannot be the economic\n“take-off” that insures a continual movement of augmented production and\nperpetually accelerated change-and-exchange of goods and services.\n\nJust prior to 1914, the Germans had become obsessed with the menace of\n“encirclement.” Their neighbors had all developed elaborate railway systems\nthat facilitated mobilization of manpower resources. Encirclement is a highly\nvisual image that had great novelty for this newly industrialized nation. In\nthe 1930s, by contrast, the German obsession was with _lebensraum_. This is\nnot a visual concern, at all. It is a claustrophobia, engendered by the radio\nimplosion and compression of space. The German defeat had thrust them back\nfrom visual obsession into brooding upon the resonating Africa within. The\ntribal past has never ceased to be a reality for the German psyche.\n\nIt was the ready access of the German and middle-European world to the rich\nnonvisual resources of auditory and tactile form that enabled them to enrich\nthe world of music and dance sculpture. Above all their tribal mode gave them\neasy access to the new nonvisual world of subatomic physics, in which long-\nliterate and long-industrialized societies are decidedly handicapped. The rich\narea of preliterate vitality felt the hot impact of radio. The message of\nradio is one of violent, unified, implosion and resonance. For Africa, India,\nChina, and even Russia, radio is a profound archaic force, a time bond with\nthe most ancient past and long-forgotten experience.\n\nTradition, in a word, is the sense of the total past as _now_. Its awakening\nis a natural result of radio impact and of electric information, in general.\nFor the intensely literate population, however, radio engendered a profound\nunlocalizable sense of guilt that sometimes expressed itself in the fellow-\ntraveler attitude. A newly found human involvement bred anxiety and insecurity\nand unpredictability. Since literacy had fostered an extreme of individualism,\nand radio had done just the opposite in reviving the ancient experience of\nkinship webs of deep tribal involvement, the literate West tried to find some\nsort of compromise in a larger sense of collective responsibility. The sudden\nimpulse to this end was just as subliminal and obscure as the earlier literary\npressure toward individual isolation and irresponsibility; therefore, nobody\nwas happy about any of the positions arrived at. The Gutenberg technology had\nproduced a new kind of visual, national entity in the sixteenth century that\nwas gradually meshed with industrial production and expansion. Telegraph and\nradio neutralized nationalism but evoked archaic tribal ghosts of the most\nvigorous brand. This is exactly the meeting of eye and ear, of explosion and\nimplosion, or as Joyce puts it in the Wake, \"“In that earopean end meets\nInd.”\" The opening of the European ear brought to an end the open society and\nreintroduced the Indic world of tribal man to West End woman. Joyce puts these\nmatters not so much in cryptic, as in dramatic and mimetic, form. The reader\nhas only to take any of his phrases such as this one, and mime it until it\nyields the intelligible. Not a long or tedious process, if approached in the\nspirit of artistic playfulness that guarantees \"“lots of fun at Finnegan’s\nwake.”\"\n\nRadio is provided with its cloak of invisibility, like any other medium. It\ncomes to us ostensibly with person-to-person directness that is private and\nintimate, while in more urgent fact, it is really a subliminal echo chamber of\nmagical power to touch remote and forgotten chords. All technological\nextensions of ourselves must be numb and subliminal, else we could not endure\nthe leverage exerted upon us by such extension. Even more than telephone or\ntelegraph, radio is that extension of the central nervous system that is\nmatched only by human speech itself. Is it not worthy of our meditation that\nradio should be specially attuned to that primitive extension of our central\nnervous system, that aboriginal mass medium, the vernacular tongue? The\ncrossing of these two most intimate and potent of human technologies could not\npossibly have failed to provide some extraordinary new shapes for human\nexperience. So it proved with Hitler, the somnambulist. But does the\ndetribalized and literate West imagine that it has earned immunity to the\ntribal magic of radio as a permanent possession? Our teenagers in the 1950s\nbegan to manifest many of the tribal stigmata. The adolescent, as opposed to\nthe teenager, can now be classified as a phenomenon of literacy. Is it not\nsignificant that the adolescent was indigenous only to those areas of England\nand America where literacy had invested even food with abstract visual values?\nEurope never had adolescents. It had chaperones. Now, to the teenager, radio\ngives privacy, and at the same time it provides the tight tribal bond of the\nworld of the common market, of song, and of resonance. The ear is\nhyperesthetic compared to the neutral eye. The ear is intolerant, closed, and\nexclusive, whereas the eye is open, neutral, and associative. Ideas of\ntolerance came to the West only after two or three centuries of literacy and\nvisual Gutenberg culture. No such saturation with visual values had occurred\nin Germany by 1930. Russia is still far from any such involvement with visual\norder and values.\n\nIf we sit and talk in a dark room, words suddenly acquire new meanings and\ndifferent textures. They become richer, even, than architecture, which Le\nCorbusier rightly says can best be felt at night. All those gestural qualities\nthat the printed page strips from language come back in the dark, and on the\nradio. Given only the _sound_ of a play, we have to fill in _all_ of the\nsenses, not just the sight of the action. So much do-it-yourself, or\ncompletion and “closure” of action, develops a kind of independent isolation\nin the young that makes them remote and inaccessible. The mystic screen of\nsound with which they are invested by their radios provides the privacy for\ntheir homework, and immunity from parental behest.\n\nWith radio came great changes to the press, to advertising, to drama, and to\npoetry. Radio offered new scope to practical jokers like Morton Downey at CBS.\nA sportscaster had just begun his fifteen-minute reading from a script when he\nwas joined by Mr. Downey, who proceeded to remove his shoes and socks. Next\nfollowed coat and trousers and then underwear, while the sportscaster\nhelplessly continued his broadcast, testifying to the compelling power of the\nmike to command loyalty over modesty and the self-protective impulse.\n\nRadio created the disk jockey, and elevated the gag writer into a major\nnational role. Since the advent of radio, the gag has supplanted the joke, not\nbecause of gag writers, but because radio is a fast hot medium that has also\nrationed the reporter’s space for stories.\n\nJean Shepherd of WOR in New York regards radio as a new medium for a new kind\nof novel that he writes nightly. The mike is his pen and paper. His audience\nand their knowledge of the daily events of the world provide his characters,\nhis scenes, and moods. It is his idea that, just as Montaigne was the first to\nuse the page to record his reactions to the new world of printed books, he is\nthe first to use radio as an essay and novel form for recording our common\nawareness of a totally new world of universal human participation in all human\nevents, private or collective.\n\nTo the student of media, it is difficult to explain the human indifference to\nsocial effects of these radical forces. The phonetic alphabet and the printed\nword that exploded the closed tribal world into the open society of fragmented\nfunctions and specialist knowledge and action have never been studied in their\nroles as a magical transformer. The antithetic electric power of instant\ninformation that reverses social explosion into implosion, private enterprise\ninto organization man, and expanding empires into common markets, has obtained\nas little recognition as the written word. The power of radio to retribalize\nmankind, its almost instant reversal of individualism into collectivism,\nFascist or Marxist, has gone unnoticed. So extraordinary is this unawareness\nthat _it_ is what needs to be explained. The transforming power of media is\neasy to explain, but the ignoring of this power is not at all easy to explain.\nIt goes without saying that the universal ignoring of the psychic action of\ntechnology bespeaks some inherent function, some essential numbing of\nconsciousness such as occurs under stress and shock conditions.\n\nThe history of radio is instructive as an indicator of the bias and blindness\ninduced in any society by its pre-existent technology. The word “wireless,”\nstill used for radio in Britain, manifests the negative “horseless-carriage”\nattitude toward a new form. Early wireless was regarded as a form of\ntelegraph, and was not seen even in relation to the telephone. David Sarnoff\nin 1916 sent a memo to the Director of the American Marconi Company that\nemployed him, advocating the idea of a music box in the home. It was ignored.\nThat was the year of the Irish Easter rebellion and of the first radio\n_broadcast_. Wireless had already been used on ships as ship-to-shore\n“telegraph.” The Irish rebels used a ship’s wireless to make, not a point-to-\npoint message, but a diffused broadcast in the hope of getting word to some\nship that would relay their story to the American press. And so it proved.\nEven after broadcasting had been in existence for some years, there was no\ncommercial interest in it. It was the amateur operators or hams and their\nfans, whose petitions finally got some action in favor of the setting up of\nfacilities. There was reluctance and opposition from the world of the press,\nwhich, in England, led to the formation of the BBC and the firm shackling of\nradio by newspaper and advertising interests. This is an obvious rivalry that\nhas not been openly discussed. The restrictive pressure by the press on radio\nand TV is still a hot issue in Britain and in Canada. But, typically,\nmisunderstanding of the nature of the medium rendered the restraining policies\nquite futile. Such has always been the case, most notoriously in government\ncensorship of the press and of the movies. Although the medium is the\n_message_ , the controls go beyond programming. The restraints are always\ndirected to the “content,” which is always another medium. The content of the\npress is literary statement, as the content of the book is speech, and the\ncontent of the movie is the novel. So the effects of radio are quite\nindependent of its programming. To those who have never studied media, this\nfact is quite as baffling as literacy is to natives, who say, “Why do you\nwrite? Can’t you remember?”\n\nThus, the commercial interests who think to render media universally\nacceptable, invariably settle for “entertainment” as a strategy of neutrality.\nA more spectacular mode of the ostrich-head-in-sand could not be devised, for\nit ensures maximal pervasiveness for any medium whatever. The literate\ncommunity will always argue for a controversial or point-of-view use of press,\nradio, and movie that would in effect diminish the operation, not only of\npress, radio and movie, but of the book as well. The commercial entertainment\nstrategy automatically ensures maximum speed and force of impact for any\nmedium, on psychic and social life equally. It thus becomes a comic strategy\nof unwitting self-liquidation, conducted by those who are dedicated to\npermanence, rather than to change. In the future, the only effective media\ncontrols must take the thermostatic form of quantitative rationing. Just as we\nnow try to control atom-bomb fallout, so we will one day try to control media\nfallout. Education will become recognized as civil defense against media\nfallout. The only medium for which our education now offers some civil defense\nis the print medium. The educational establishment, founded on print, does not\nyet admit any other responsibilities.\n\nRadio provides a speedup of information that also causes acceleration in other\nmedia. It certainly contracts the world to village size, and creates\ninsatiable village tastes for gossip, rumor, and personal malice. But while\nradio contracts the world to village dimensions, it hasn’t the effect of\nhomogenizing the village quarters. Quite the contrary. In India, where radio\nis the supreme form of communication, there are more than a dozen official\nlanguages and the same number of official radio networks. The effect of radio\nas a reviver of archaism and ancient memories is not limited to Hitler’s\nGermany. Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have undergone resurgence of their\nancient tongues since the coming of radio, and the Israeli present an even\nmore extreme instance of linguistic revival. They now speak a language which\nhas been dead in books for centuries. Radio is not only a mighty awakener of\narchaic memories, forces, and animosities, but a decentralizing, pluralistic\nforce, as is really the case with all electric power and media.\n\nCentralism of organization is based on the continuous, visual, lineal\nstructuring that arises from phonetic literacy. At first, therefore, electric\nmedia merely followed the established patterns of literate structures. Radio\nwas released from these centralist network pressures by TV. TV then took up\nthe burden of centralism, from which it may be released by Telstar. With TV\naccepting the central network burden derived from our centralized industrial\norganization, radio was free to diversify, and to begin a regional and local\ncommunity service that it had not known, even in the earliest days of the\nradio “hams.” Since TV, radio has turned to the individual needs of people at\ndifferent times of the day, a fact that goes with the multiplicity of\nreceiving sets in bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, cars, and now in pockets.\nDifferent programs are provided for those engaged in diverse activities.\nRadio, once a form of group listening that emptied churches, has reverted to\nprivate and individual uses since TV. The teenager withdraws from the TV group\nto his private radio.\n\nThis natural bias of radio to a close tie-in with diversified community groups\nis best manifested in the disk-jockey cults, and in radio’s use of the\ntelephone in a glorified form of the old trunkline wire-tapping. Plato, who\nhad old-fashioned tribal ideas of political structure, said that the proper\nsize of a city was indicated by the number of people who could hear the voice\nof a public speaker. Even the printed book, let alone radio, renders the\npolitical assumptions of Plato quite irrelevant for practical purposes. Yet\nradio, because of its ease of decentralized intimate relation with both\nprivate and small communities, could easily implement the Platonic political\ndream on a world scale.\n\nThe uniting of radio with phonograph that constitutes the average radio\nprogram yields a very special pattern quite superior in power to the\ncombination of radio and telegraph press that yields our news and weather\nprograms. It is curious how much more arresting are the weather reports than\nthe news, on both radio and TV. Is not this because “weather” is now entirely\nan electronic form of information, whereas news retains much of the pattern of\nthe printed word? It is probably the print and book bias of the BBC and the\nCBC that renders them so awkward and inhibited in radio and TV presentation.\nCommercial urgency, rather than artistic insight, fostered by contrast a\nhectic vivacity in the corresponding American operation.\n\n  *[F.D.R.]: Franklin Delano Roosevelt\n  *[CBS]: Columbia Broadcasting Systems\n  *[BBC]: British Broadcasting Corporation\n  *[CBC]: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\n\n\n![Television: The Timid Giant](images/title-31.png)\n\nPerhaps the most familiar and pathetic effect of the TV image is the posture\nof children in the early grades. Since TV, children — regardless of eye\ncondition — average about six and a half inches from the printed page. Our\nchildren are striving to carry over to the printed page the all-involving\nsensory mandate of the TV image. With perfect psycho-mimetic skill, they carry\nout the commands of the TV image. They pore, they probe, they slow down and\ninvolve themselves in depth. This is what they had learned to do in the cool\niconography of the comic-book medium. TV carried the process much further.\nSuddenly they are transferred to the hot print medium with its uniform\npatterns and fast lineal movement. Pointlessly they strive to read print in\ndepth. They bring to print all their senses, and print rejects them. Print\nasks for the isolated and stripped-down visual faculty, not for the unified\nsensorium.\n\nThe Mackworth head-camera, when worn by children watching TV, has revealed\nthat their eyes follow, not the actions, but the reactions. The eyes scarcely\ndeviate from the faces of the actors, even during scenes of violence. This\nhead-camera shows by projection both the scene and the eye movement\nsimultaneously. Such extraordinary behavior is another indication of the very\ncool and involving character of this medium.\n\nOn the Jack Paar show for March 8, 1963, Richard Nixon was Paared down and\nremade into a suitable TV image. It turns out that Mr. Nixon is both a pianist\nand a composer. With sure tact for the character of the TV medium, Jack Paar\nbrought out this _pianoforte_ side of Mr. Nixon, with excellent effect.\nInstead of the slick, glib, legal Nixon, we saw the doggedly creative and\nmodest performer. A few timely touches like this would have quite altered the\nresult of the Kennedy-Nixon campaign. TV is a medium that rejects the sharp\npersonality and favors the presentation of processes rather than of products.\n\nThe adaptation of TV to processes, rather than to the neatly packaged\nproducts, explains the frustration many people experience with this medium in\nits political uses. An article by Edith Efron in TV Guide (May 18–24, 1963)\nlabeled TV “The Timid Giant,” because it is unsuited to hot issues and sharply\ndefined controversial topics: \"“Despite official freedom from censorship, a\nself-imposed silence renders network documentaries almost mute on many great\nissues of the day.”\" As a cool medium TV has, some feel, introduced a kind of\n_rigor mortis_ into the body politic. It is the extraordinary degree of\naudience participation in the TV medium that explains its failure to tackle\nhot issues. Howard K. Smith observed: \"“The networks are delighted if you go\ninto a controversy in a country 14,000 miles away. They don’t want real\ncontroversy, real dissent, at home.”\" For people conditioned to the hot\nnewspaper medium, which is concerned with the clash of _views_ , rather than\ninvolvement in _depth_ in a situation, the TV behavior is inexplicable.\n\nSuch a hot news item that concerns TV directly was headlined \"“It finally\nhappened — a British film with English subtitles to explain the dialects.”\"\nThe film in question is the British comedy “Sparrows Don’t Sing.” A glossary\nof Yorkshire, Cockney, and other slang phrases has been printed for the\ncustomers so that they can figure out just what the subtitles mean. Sub\nsubtitles are as handy an indicator of the depth effects of TV as the new\n“rugged” styles in feminine attire. One of the most extraordinary developments\nsince TV in England has been the upsurge of regional dialects. A regional\nbrogue or “burr” is the vocal equivalent of gaiter stockings. Such brogues\nundergo continual erosion from literacy. Their sudden prominence in England in\nareas in which previously one had heard only standard English is one of the\nmost significant cultural events of our time. Even in the classrooms of Oxford\nand Cambridge, the local dialects are heard again. The undergraduates of those\nuniversities no longer strive to achieve a uniform speech. Dialectal speech\nsince TV has been found to provide a social bond in depth, not possible with\nthe artificial “standard English” that began only a century ago.\n\nAn article on Perry Como bills him as \"“Low-pressure king of high-pressure\nrealm.”\" The success of any TV performer depends on his achieving a low-\npressure style of presentation although getting his act on the air may require\nmuch high-pressure organization. Castro may be a case in point. According to\nTad Szulc’s story on “Cuban Television’s One-man Show” (The Eighth Art), \"“in\nhis seemingly improvised ‘as-I-go-along’ style he can evolve politics and\ngovern his country — right on camera.”\" Now, Tad Szulc is under the illusion\nthat TV is a hot medium, and suggests that in the Congo \"“television might\nhave helped Lumumba to incite the masses to even greater turmoil and\nbloodshed.”\" But he is quite wrong. Radio is the medium for frenzy, and it has\nbeen the major means of hotting up the tribal blood of Africa, India, and\nChina, alike. TV has cooled Cuba down, as it is cooling down America. What the\nCubans are getting by TV is the experience of being directly engaged in the\nmaking of political decisions. Castro presents himself as a teacher, and as\nSzulc says, \"“manages to blend political guidance and education with\npropaganda so skillfully that it is often difficult to tell where one begins\nand the other ends.”\" Exactly the same mix is used in entertainment in Europe\nand America alike. Seen outside the United States, any American movie looks\nlike subtle political propaganda. Acceptable entertainment has to flatter and\nexploit the cultural and political assumptions of the land of its origin.\nThese unspoken presuppositions also serve to blind people to the most obvious\nfacts about a new medium like TV.\n\nIn a group of simulcasts of several media done in Toronto a few years back, TV\ndid a strange flip. Four randomized groups of university students were given\nthe same information at the same time about the structure of preliterate\nlanguages. One group received it via radio, one from TV, one by lecture, and\none read it. For all but the reader group, the information was passed along in\nstraight verbal flow by the same speaker without discussion or questions or\nuse of blackboard. Each group had half an hour of exposure to the material.\nEach was asked to fill in the same quiz afterward. It was quite a surprise to\nthe experimenters when the students performed better with TV-channeled\ninformation and with radio than they did with lecture and print — and the TV\ngroup stood _well_ above the radio group. Since nothing had been done to give\nspecial stress to any of these four media, the experiment was repeated with\nother randomized groups. This time each medium was allowed full opportunity to\ndo its stuff. For radio and TV, the material was dramatized with many auditory\nand visual features. The lecturer took full advantage of the blackboard and\nclass discussion. The printed form was embellished with an imaginative use of\ntypography and page layout to stress each point in the lecture. All of these\nmedia had been stepped up to high intensity for this repeat of the original\nperformance. Television and radio once again showed results high above lecture\nand print. Unexpectedly to the testers, however, radio now stood significantly\nabove television. It was a long time before the obvious reason declared\nitself, namely that TV is a cool, participant medium. When hotted up by\ndramatization and stingers, it performs less well because there is less\nopportunity for participation. Radio is a hot medium. When given additional\nintensity, it performs better. It doesn’t invite the same degree of\nparticipation in its users. Radio will serve as background-sound or as noise-\nlevel control, as when the ingenious teenager employs it as a means of\nprivacy. TV will not work as background. It engages you. You have to be _with_\nit. (The phrase has gained acceptance since TV.)\n\nA great many things will not work since the arrival of TV. Not only the\nmovies, but the national magazines as well, have been hit very hard by this\nnew medium. Even the comic books have declined greatly. Before TV, there had\nbeen much concern about why Johnny couldn’t read. Since TV, Johnny has\nacquired an entirely new set of perceptions. He is not at all the same. Otto\nPreminger, director of Anatomy of a Murder and other hits, dates a great\nchange in movie making and viewing from the very first year of general TV\nprogramming. \"“In 1951,”\" he wrote, \"“I started a fight to get the release in\nmotion-picture theaters of The Moon Is Blue after the production code approval\nwas refused. It was a small fight and I won it.”\" (Toronto Daily Star, October\n19, 1963)\n\nHe went on to say, \"“The very fact that it was the word ‘virgin’ that was\nobjected to in The Moon Is Blue is today laughable, almost incredible.”\" Otto\nPreminger considers that American movies have advanced toward maturity owing\nto the influence of TV. The cool TV medium promotes depth structures in art\nand entertainment alike, and creates audience involvement in depth as well.\nSince nearly all our technologies and entertainment since Gutenberg have been\nnot cool, but hot; and not deep, but fragmentary; not producer-oriented, but\nconsumer-oriented, there is scarcely a single area of established\nrelationships, from home and church to school and market, that has not been\nprofoundly disturbed in its pattern and texture.\n\nThe psychic and social disturbance created by the TV image, and not the TV\nprogramming, occasions daily comment in the press. Raymond Burr, who plays\nPerry Mason, spoke to the National Association of Municipal Judges, reminding\nthem that, \"“Without our laymen’s understanding and acceptance, the laws which\nyou apply and the courts in which you preside cannot continue to exist.”\" What\nMr. Burr omitted to observe was that the “Perry Mason” TV program, in which he\nplays the lead, is typical of that intensely participational kind of TV\nexperience that has altered our relation to the laws and the courts.\n\nThe mode of the TV image has nothing in common with film or photo, except that\nit offers also a nonverbal _gestalt_ or posture of forms. With TV, the viewer\nis the screen. He is bombarded with light impulses that James Joyce called the\n\"“Charge of the Light Brigade”\" that imbues his \"“soulskin with sobconscious\ninklings.”\" The TV image is visually low in data. The TV image is not a still\nshot. It is not photo in any sense, but a ceaselessly forming contour of\nthings limned by the scanning-finger. The resulting plastic contour appears by\nlight _through_ , not light _on_ , and the image so formed has the quality of\nsculpture and icon, rather than of picture. The TV image offers some three\nmillion dots per second to the receiver. From these he accepts only a few\ndozen each instant, from which to make an image.\n\nThe film image offers many more millions of data per second, and the viewer\ndoes not have to make the same drastic reduction of items to form his\nimpression. He tends instead to accept the full image as a package deal. In\ncontrast, the viewer of the TV mosaic, with technical control of the image,\nunconsciously reconfigures the dots into an abstract work of art on the\npattern of a Seurat or Rouault. If anybody were to ask whether all this would\nchange if technology stepped up the character of the TV image to movie data\nlevel, one could only counter by inquiring, \"“Could we alter a cartoon by\nadding details of perspective and light and shade?”\" The answer is “Yes,” only\nit would then no longer be a cartoon. Nor would “improved” TV be television.\nThe TV image is _now_ a mosaic mesh of light and dark spots which a movie shot\nnever is, even when the quality of the movie image is very poor.\n\nAs in any other mosaic, the third dimension is alien to TV, but it can be\nsuperimposed. In TV the illusion of the third dimension is provided slightly\nby the stage sets in the studio; but the TV image itself is a flat two-\ndimensional mosaic. Most of the three-dimensional illusion is a carry-over of\nhabitual viewing of film and photo. For the TV camera does not have a built-in\nangle of vision like the movie camera. Eastman Kodak now has a two-dimensional\ncamera that can match the flat effects of the TV camera. Yet it is hard for\nliterate people, with their habit of fixed points of view and three-\ndimensional vision, to understand the properties of two-dimensional vision. If\nit had been easy for them, they would have had no difficulties with abstract\nart, General Motors would not have made a mess of motorcar design, and the\npicture magazine would not be having difficulties now with the relationship\nbetween features and ads. The TV image requires each instant that we “close”\nthe spaces in the mesh by a convulsive sensuous participation that is\nprofoundly kinetic and tactile, because tactility is the interplay of the\nsenses, rather than the isolated contact of skin and object.\n\nTo contrast it with the film shot, many directors refer to the TV image as one\nof “low definition,” in the sense that it offers little detail and a low\ndegree of information, much like the cartoon. A TV close-up provides only as\nmuch information as a small section of a long-shot on the movie-screen. For\nlack of observing so central an aspect of the TV image, the critics of program\n“content” have talked nonsense about “TV violence.” The spokesmen of\ncensorious views are typically semiliterate book-oriented individuals who have\nno competence in the grammars of newspaper, or radio, or of film, but who look\naskew and askance at all non-book media. The simplest question about any\npsychic aspect, even of the book medium, throws these people into a panic of\nuncertainty. Vehemence of projection of a single isolated attitude they\nmistake for moral vigilance. Once these censors became aware that in all cases\n“the medium is the message” or the basic source of effects, they would turn to\nsuppression of media as such, instead of seeking “content” control. Their\ncurrent assumption that content or programming is the factor that influences\noutlook and action is derived from the book medium, with its sharp cleavage\nbetween form and content.\n\nIs it not strange that TV should have been as revolutionary a medium in\nAmerica in the 1950s as radio in Europe in the 1930s? Radio, the medium that\nresuscitated the tribal and kinship webs of the European mind in the 1920s and\n1930s, had no such effect in England or America. There, the erosion of tribal\nbonds by means of literacy and its industrial extensions had gone so far that\nour radio did not achieve any notable tribal reactions. Yet ten years of TV\nhave Europeanized even the United States, as witness its changed feelings for\nspace and personal relations. There is new sensitivity to the dance, plastic\narts, and architecture, as well as the demand for the small car, the\npaperback, sculptural hairdos and molded dress effects — to say nothing of a\nnew concern for complex effects in cuisine and in the use of wines.\nNotwithstanding, it would be misleading to say that TV will retribalize\nEngland and America. The action of radio on the world of resonant speech and\nmemory was hysterical. But TV has certainly made England and America\nvulnerable to radio where previously they had immunity to a great degree. For\ngood or ill, the TV image has exerted a unifying synesthetic force on the\nsense-life of these intensely literate populations, such as they have lacked\nfor centuries. It is wise to withhold all value judgments when studying these\nmedia matters, since their effects are not capable of being isolated.\n\nSynesthesia, or unified sense and imaginative life, had long seemed an\nunattainable dream to Western poets, painters, and artists in general. They\nhad looked with sorrow and dismay on the fragmented and impoverished\nimaginative life of Western literate man in the eighteenth century and later.\nSuch was the message of Blake and Pater, Yeats and D. H. Lawrence, and a host\nof other great figures. They were not prepared to have their dreams realized\nin everyday life by the esthetic action of radio and television. Yet these\nmassive extensions of our central nervous systems have enveloped Western man\nin a daily session of synesthesia. The Western way of life attained centuries\nsince by the rigorous separation and specialization of the senses, with the\nvisual sense atop the hierarchy, is not able to withstand the radio and TV\nwaves that wash about the great visual structure of abstract Individual Man.\nThose who, from political motives, would now add their force to the anti-\nindividual action of our electric technology are puny subliminal automatons\naping the patterns of the prevailing electric pressures. A century ago they\nwould, with equal somnambulism, have faced in the opposite direction. German\nRomantic poets and philosophers had been chanting in tribal chorus for a\nreturn to the dark unconscious for over a century before radio and Hitler made\nsuch a return difficult to avoid. What is to be thought of people who wish\nsuch a return to preliterate ways, when they have no inkling of how the\ncivilized visual way was ever substituted for tribal auditory magic?\n\nAt this hour, when Americans are discovering new passions for skin-diving and\nthe wraparound space of small cars, thanks to the indomitable tactile\npromptings of the TV image, the same image is inspiring many English people\nwith race feelings of tribal exclusiveness. Whereas highly literate Westerners\nhave always idealized the condition of integration of races, it has been their\nliterate culture that made impossible real uniformity among races. Literate\nman naturally dreams of visual solutions to the problems of human differences.\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, this kind of dream suggested similar\ndress and education for both men and women. The failure of the sex-integration\nprograms has provided the theme of much of the literature and psychoanalysis\nof the twentieth century. Race integration, undertaken on the basis of visual\nuniformity, is an extension of the same cultural strategy of literate man, for\nwhom differences always seem to need eradication, both in sex and in race, and\nin space and in time. Electronic man, by becoming ever more deeply involved in\nthe actualities of the human condition, cannot accept the literate cultural\nstrategy. The Negro will reject a plan of visual uniformity as definitely as\nwomen did earlier, and for the same reasons. Women found that they had been\nrobbed of their distinctive roles and turned into fragmented citizens in “a\nman’s world.” The entire approach to these problems in terms of uniformity and\nsocial homogenization is a final pressure of the mechanical and industrial\ntechnology. Without moralizing, it can be said that the electric age, by\ninvolving all men deeply in one another, will come to reject such mechanical\nsolutions. It is more difficult to provide uniqueness and diversity than it is\nto impose the uniform patterns of mass education; but it is such uniqueness\nand diversity that can be fostered under electric conditions as never before.\n\nTemporarily, all preliterate groups in the world have begun to feel the\nexplosive and aggressive energies that are released by the onset of the new\nliteracy and mechanization. These explosions come just at a time when the new\nelectric technology combines to make us share them on a global scale.\n\nThe effect of TV, as the most recent and spectacular electric extension of our\ncentral nervous system, is hard to grasp for various reasons. Since it has\naffected the totality of our lives, personal and social and political, it\nwould be quite unrealistic to attempt a “systematic” or visual presentation of\nsuch influence. Instead, it is more feasible to “present” TV as a complex\n_gestalt_ of data gathered almost at random.\n\nThe TV image is of low intensity or definition, and therefore, unlike film, it\ndoes not afford detailed information about objects. The difference is akin to\nthat between the old manuscripts and the printed word. Print gave intensity\nand uniform precision, where before there had been a diffuse texture. Print\nbrought in the taste for exact measurement and repeatability that we now\nassociate with science and mathematics.\n\nThe TV producer will point out that speech on television must not have the\ncareful precision necessary in the theater. The TV actor does not have to\nproject either his voice or himself. Likewise, TV acting is so extremely\nintimate, because of the peculiar involvement of the viewer with the\ncompletion or “closing” of the TV image, that the actor must achieve a great\ndegree of spontaneous casualness that would be irrelevant in movies and lost\non stage. For the audience participates in the inner life of the TV actor as\nfully as in the outer life of the movie star. Technically, TV tends to be a\nclose-up medium. The close-up that in the movie is used for shock is, on TV, a\nquite casual thing. And whereas a glossy photo the size of the TV screen would\nshow a dozen faces in adequate detail, a dozen faces on the TV screen are only\na blur.\n\nThe peculiar character of the TV image in its relation to the actor causes\nsuch familiar reactions as our not being able to recognize in real life a\nperson whom we see every week on TV. Not many of us are as alert as the\nkindergartener who said to Garry Moore, \"“How did you get off TV?”\"\nNewscasters and actors alike report the frequency with which they are\napproached by people who feel they’ve met them before. Joanne Woodward in an\ninterview was asked what was the difference between being a movie star and a\nTV actress. She replied: \"“When I was in the movies I heard people say, ‘There\ngoes Joanne Woodward.’ Now they say, ‘There goes someone I think I know.’ ”\"\n\nThe owner of a Hollywood hotel in an area where many movie and TV actors\nreside reported that tourists had switched their allegiance to TV stars.\nMoreover, most TV stars are men, that is, “cool characters,” while most movie\nstars are women, since they can be presented as “hot” characters. Men and\nwomen movie stars alike, along with the entire star system, have tended to\ndwindle into a more moderate status since TV. The movie is a hot, high-\ndefinition medium. Perhaps the most interesting observation of the hotel\nproprietor was that the tourists wanted to see Perry Mason and Wyatt Earp.\nThey did not want to see Raymond Burr and Hugh O’Brian. The old movie-fan\ntourists had wanted to see their favorites as they were in _real_ life, not as\nthey were in their film roles. The fans of the cool TV medium want to see\ntheir star in role, whereas the movie fans want the _real thing_.\n\nA similar reversal of attitudes occurred with the printed book. There was\nlittle interest in the private lives of authors under manuscript or scribal\nculture. Today the comic strip is close to the preprint woodcut and manuscript\nform of expression. Walt Kelly’s Pogo looks very much indeed like a gothic\npage. Yet in spite of great public interest in the comic-strip form, there is\nas little curiosity about the private lives of these artists as about the\nlives of popular-song writers. With print, the private life became of the\nutmost concern to readers. Print is a hot medium. It projects the author at\nthe public as the movie did. The manuscript is a cool medium that does not\nproject the author, so much as involve the reader. So with TV. The viewer is\ninvolved and participant. The _role_ of the TV star, in this way, seems more\nfascinating than his private life. It is thus that the student of media, like\nthe psychiatrist, gets more data from his informants than they themselves have\nperceived. Everybody experiences far more than he understands. Yet it is\nexperience, rather than understanding, that influences behavior, especially in\ncollective matters of media and technology, where the individual is almost\ninevitably unaware of their effect upon him.\n\nSome may find it paradoxical that a cool medium like TV should be so much more\ncompressed and condensed than a hot medium like film. But it is well-known\nthat a half-minute of television is equal to three minutes of stage or\nvaudeville. The same is true of manuscript in contrast to print. The “cool”\nmanuscript tended toward compressed forms of statement, aphoristic and\nallegorical. The “hot” print medium expanded expression in the direction of\nsimplification and the “spelling-out” of meanings. Print speeded up and\n“exploded” the compressed script into simpler fragments.\n\nA cool medium, whether the spoken word or the manuscript or TV, leaves much\nmore for the listener or user to do than a hot medium. If the medium is of\nhigh definition, participation is low. If the medium is of low intensity, the\nparticipation is high. Perhaps this is why lovers mumble so.\n\nBecause the low definition of TV insures a high degree of audience\ninvolvement, the most effective programs are those that present situations\nwhich consist of some process to be completed. Thus, to use TV to teach poetry\nwould permit the teacher to concentrate on the poetic process of actual\n_making_ , as it pertained to a particular poem. The book form is quite\nunsuited to this type of involved presentation. The same salience of process\nof do-it-yourself-ness and depth involvement in the TV image extends to the\nart of the TV actor. Under TV conditions, he must be alert to improvise and to\nembellish every phrase and verbal resonance with details of gesture and\nposture, sustaining that intimacy with the viewer which is not possible on the\nmassive movie screen or on the stage.\n\nThere is the alleged remark of the Nigerian who, after seeing a TV western,\nsaid delightedly, \"“I did not realize you valued human life so little in the\nWest.”\" Offsetting this remark is the behavior of our children in watching TV\nwesterns. When equipped with the new experimental head-cameras that follow\ntheir eye movements while watching the image, children keep their eyes on the\nfaces of the TV actors. Even during physical violence their eyes remain\nconcentrated on the facial _reactions_ , rather than on the eruptive _action_.\nGuns, knives, fists, all are ignored in preference for the facial expression.\nTV is not so much an action, as a re-action, medium.\n\nThe yen of the TV medium for themes of process and complex reactions has\nenabled the documentary type of film to come to the fore. The movie _can_\nhandle process superbly, but the movie viewer is more disposed to be a passive\nconsumer of actions, rather than a participant in reactions. The movie\nwestern, like the movie documentary, has always been a lowly form. With TV,\nthe western acquired new importance, since its theme is always: “Let’s make a\ntown.” The audience participates in the shaping and processing of a community\nfrom meager and unpromising components. Moreover, the TV image takes kindly to\nthe varied and rough textures of Western saddles, clothes, hides, and shoddy\nmatch-wood bars and hotel lobbies. The movie camera, by contrast, is at home\nin the slick chrome world of the night club and the luxury spots of a\nmetropolis. Moreover, the contrasting camera preferences of the movies in the\nTwenties and Thirties, and of TV in the Fifties and Sixties spread to the\nentire population. In ten years the new tastes of America in clothes, in food,\nin housing, in entertainment, and in vehicles express the new pattern of\ninterrelation of forms and do-it-yourself involvement fostered by the TV\nimage.\n\nIt is no accident that such major movie stars as Rita Hayworth, Liz Taylor,\nand Marilyn Monroe ran into troubled waters in the new TV age. They ran into\nan age that questioned all the “hot” media values of the pre-TV consumer days.\nThe TV image challenges the values of fame as much as the values of consumer\ngoods. \"“Fame to me,”\" said Marilyn Monroe, \"“certainly is only a temporary\nand a partial happiness. Fame is not really for a daily diet, that’s not what\nfulfills you.… I think that when you are famous every weakness is exaggerated.\nThis industry should behave to its stars like a mother whose child has just\nrun out in front of a car. But instead of clasping the child to them they\nstart punishing the child.”\"\n\nThe movie community is now getting clobbered by TV, and lashes out at anybody\nin its bewildered petulance. These words of the great movie puppet who wed Mr.\nBaseball and Mr. Broadway are surely a portent. If many of the rich and\nsuccessful figures in America were to question publicly the absolute value of\nmoney and success as means to happiness and human welfare, they would offer no\nmore shattering a precedent than Marilyn Monroe. For nearly fifty years,\nHollywood had offered \"“the fallen woman”\" a way to the top and a way to the\nhearts of all. Suddenly the love-goddess emits a horrible cry, screams that\neating people is wrong, and utters denunciations of the whole way of life.\nThis is exactly the mood of the suburban beatniks. They reject a fragmented\nand specialist consumer life for anything that offers humble involvement and\ndeep commitment. It is the same mood that recently turned girls from\nspecialist careers to early marriage and big families. They switch from jobs\nto roles.\n\nThe same new preference for depth participation has also prompted in the young\na strong drive toward religious experience with rich liturgical overtones. The\nliturgical revival of the radio and TV age affects even the most austere\nProtestant sects. Choral chant and rich vestments have appeared in every\nquarter. The ecumenical movement is synonymous with electric technology.\n\nJust as TV, the mosaic mesh, does not foster perspective in art, it does not\nfoster lineality in living. Since TV, the assembly line has disappeared from\nindustry. Staff and line structures have dissolved in management. Gone are the\nstag line, the party line, the receiving line, and the pencil line from the\nbacks of nylons.\n\nWith TV came the end of bloc voting in politics, a form of specialism and\nfragmentation that won’t work since TV. Instead of the voting bloc, we have\nthe icon, the inclusive image. Instead of a political viewpoint or platform,\nthe inclusive political posture or stance. Instead of the product, the\nprocess. In periods of new and rapid growth there is a blurring of outlines.\nIn the TV image we have the supremacy of the blurred outline, itself the\nmaximal incentive to growth and new “closure” or completion, especially for a\nconsumer culture long related to the sharp visual values that had become\nseparated from the other senses. So great is the change in American lives,\nresulting from the loss of loyalty to the consumer package in entertainment\nand commerce, that every enterprise, from Madison Avenue and General Motors to\nHollywood and General Foods, has been shaken thoroughly and forced to seek new\nstrategies of action. What electric implosion or contraction has done inter-\npersonally and inter-nationally, the TV image does intra-personally or intra-\nsensuously.\n\nIt is not hard to explain this sensuous revolution to painters and sculptors,\nfor they have been striving, ever since Cézanne abandoned perspective illusion\nin favor of structure in painting, to bring about the very change that TV has\nnow effected on a fantastic scale. TV is the Bauhaus program of design and\nliving, or the Montessori educational strategy, given total technological\nextension and commercial sponsorship. The aggressive lunge of artistic\nstrategy for the remaking of Western man has, _via_ TV, become a vulgar sprawl\nand an overwhelming splurge in American life.\n\nIt would be impossible to exaggerate the degree to which this image has\ndisposed America to European modes of sense and sensibility. America is now\nEuropeanizing as furiously as Europe is Americanizing. Europe, during the\nSecond War, developed much of the industrial technology needed for its first\nmass consumer phase. It was, on the other hand, the First War that had readied\nAmerica for the same consumer “take-off.” It took the electronic _implosion_\nto dissolve the nationalist diversity of a splintered Europe, and to do for it\nwhat the industrial _explosion_ had done for America. The industrial explosion\nthat accompanies the fragmenting expansion of literacy and industry was able\nto exert little unifying effect in the European world with its numerous\ntongues and cultures. The Napoleonic thrust had utilized the combined force of\nthe new literacy and early industrialism. But Napoleon had had a less\nhomogenized set of materials to work with than even the Russians have today.\nThe homogenizing power of the literate process had gone further in America by\n1800 than anywhere in Europe. From the first, America took to heart the print\ntechnology for its educational, industrial, and political life; and it was\nrewarded by an unprecedented pool of standardized workers and consumers, such\nas no culture had ever had before. That our cultural historians have been\noblivious of the homogenizing power of typography, and of the irresistible\nstrength of homogenized populations, is no credit to them. Political\nscientists have been quite unaware of the effects of media anywhere at any\ntime, simply because nobody has been willing to study the personal and social\neffects of media apart from their “content.”\n\nAmerica long ago achieved its Common Market by mechanical and literate\nhomogenization of social organization. Europe is now getting a unity under the\nelectric auspices of compression and interrelation. Just how much\nhomogenization via literacy is needed to make an effective producer-consumer\ngroup in the post-mechanical age, in the age of automation, nobody has ever\nasked. For it has never been fully recognized that the role of literacy in\nshaping an industrial economy is basic and archetypal. Literacy is\nindispensable for habits of uniformity at all times and places. Above all, it\nis needed for the workability of price systems and markets. This factor has\nbeen ignored exactly as TV is now being ignored, for TV fosters many\npreferences that are quite at variance with literate uniformity and\nrepeatability. It has sent Americans questing for every sort of oddment and\nquaintness in objects from out of their storied past. Many Americans will now\nspare no pains or expense to get to taste some new wine or food. The uniform\nand repeatable now must yield to the uniquely askew, a fact that is\nincreasingly the despair and confusion of our entire standardized economy.\n\nThe power of the TV mosaic to transform American innocence into depth\nsophistication, independently of “content,” is not mysterious if looked at\ndirectly. This mosaic TV image had already been adumbrated in the popular\npress that grew up with the telegraph. The commercial use of the telegraph\nbegan in 1844 in America, and earlier in England. The electric principle and\nits implications received much attention in Shelley’s poetry. Artistic rule-\nof-thumb usually anticipates the science and technology in these matters by a\nfull generation or more. The meaning of the telegraph mosaic in its\njournalistic manifestations was not lost to the mind of Edgar Allan Poe. He\nused it to establish two startlingly new inventions, the symbolist poem and\nthe detective story. Both of these forms require do-it-yourself participation\non the part of the reader. By offering an incomplete image or process, Poe\n_involved_ his readers in the creative process in a way that Baudelaire,\nValéry, T. S. Eliot, and many others have admired and followed. Poe had\ngrasped at once the electric dynamic as one of public participation in\ncreativity. Nevertheless, even today the homogenized consumer complains when\nasked to participate in creating or completing an abstract poem or painting or\nstructure of any kind. Yet Poe knew even then that participation in depth\nfollowed at once from the telegraph mosaic. The more lineal and literal-minded\nof the literary brahmins \"“just couldn’t see it.”\" They still can’t see it.\nThey prefer not to participate in the creative process. They have accommodated\nthemselves to the completed packages, in prose and verse and in the plastic\narts. It is these people who must confront, in every classroom in the land,\nstudents who have accommodated themselves to the tactile and nonpictorial\nmodes of symbolist and mythic structures, thanks to the TV image.\n\nLife magazine for August 10, 1962, had a feature on how “Too Many Subteens\nGrow Up Too Soon and Too Fast.” There was no observation of the fact that\nsimilar speed of growth and precociousness have always been the norm in tribal\ncultures and in nonliterate societies. England and America fostered the\ninstitution of prolonged adolescence by the negation of the tactile\nparticipation that is sex. In this, there was no conscious strategy, but\nrather a general acceptance of the consequences of prime stress on the printed\nword and visual values as a means of organizing personal and social life. This\nstress led to triumphs of industrial production and political conformity that\nwere their own sufficient warrant.\n\nRespectability, or the ability to sustain visual inspection of one’s life,\nbecame dominant. No European country allowed print such precedence. Visually,\nEurope has always been shoddy in American eyes. American women, on the other\nhand, who have never been equaled in any culture for visual turnout, have\nalways seemed abstract, mechanical dolls to Europeans. Tactility is a supreme\nvalue in European life. For that reason, on the Continent there is no\nadolescence, but only the leap from childhood to adult ways. Such is now the\nAmerican state since TV, and this state of evasion of adolescence will\ncontinue. The introspective life of long, long thoughts and distant goals, to\nbe pursued in lines of Siberian railroad kind, cannot coexist with the mosaic\nform of the TV image that commands immediate participation in _depth_ and\nadmits of no delays. The mandates of that image are so various yet so\nconsistent that even to mention them is to describe the revolution of the past\ndecade.\n\nThe phenomenon of the paperback, the book in “cool” version, can head this\nlist of TV mandates, because the TV transformation of book culture into\nsomething else is manifested at that point. Europeans have had paperbacks from\nthe first. From the beginnings of the automobile, they have preferred the\nwraparound space of the small car. The pictorial value of “enclosed space” for\nbook, car, or house has never appealed to them. The paperback, especially in\nits highbrow form, was tried in America in the 1920s and thirties and forties.\nIt was not, however, until 1953 that it suddenly became acceptable. No\npublisher really knows why. Not only is the paperback a tactile, rather than a\nvisual package; it can be as readily concerned with profound matters as with\nfroth. The American since TV has lost his inhibitions and his innocence about\ndepth culture. The paperback reader has discovered that he can enjoy Aristotle\nor Confucius by simply slowing down. The old literate habit of racing ahead on\nuniform lines of print yielded suddenly to depth reading. Reading in depth is,\nof course, not proper to the printed word as such. Depth probing of words and\nlanguage is a normal feature of oral and manuscript cultures, rather than of\nprint. Europeans have always felt that the English and Americans lacked depth\nin their culture. Since radio, and especially since TV, English and American\nliterary critics have exceeded the performance of any European in depth and\nsubtlety. The beatnik reaching out for Zen is only carrying the mandate of the\nTV mosaic out into the world of words and perception. The paperback itself has\nbecome a vast mosaic world in depth, expressive of the changed sense-life of\nAmericans, for whom depth experience in words, as in physics, has become\nentirely acceptable, and even sought after.\n\nJust where to begin to examine the transformation of American attitudes since\nTV is a most arbitrary affair, as can be seen in a change so great as the\nabrupt decline of baseball. The removal of the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles\nwas a portent in itself. Baseball moved West in an attempt to retain an\naudience after TV struck. The characteristic mode of the baseball game is that\nit features one-thing-at-a-time. It is a lineal, expansive game which, like\ngolf, is perfectly adapted to the outlook of an individualist and inner-\ndirected society. Timing and waiting are of the essence, with the entire field\nin suspense waiting upon the performance of a single player. By contrast,\nfootball, basketball, and ice hockey are games in which many events occur\nsimultaneously, with the entire team involved at the same time. With the\nadvent of TV, such isolation of the individual performance as occurs in\nbaseball became unacceptable. Interest in baseball declined, and its stars,\nquite as much as movie stars, found that fame had some very cramping\ndimensions. Baseball had been, like the movies, a hot medium featuring\nindividual virtuosity and stellar performers. The real ball fan is a store of\nstatistical information about previous explosions of batters and pitchers in\nnumerous games. Nothing could indicate more clearly the peculiar satisfaction\nprovided by a game that belonged to the industrial metropolis of ceaselessly\nexploding populations, stocks and bonds, and production and sales records.\nBaseball belonged to the age of the first onset of the hot press and the movie\nmedium. It will always remain a symbol of the era of the hot mommas, jazz\nbabies, of sheiks and shebas, of vamps and gold-diggers and the fast buck.\nBaseball, in a word, is a hot game that got cooled off in the new TV climate,\nas did most of the hot politicians and hot issues of the earlier decade.\n\nThere is no cooler medium or hotter issue at present than the small car. It is\nlike a badly wired woofer in a hi-fi circuit that produces a tremendous\nflutter in the bottom. The small European car, like the European paperback and\nthe European belle, for that matter, was no visual package job. Visually, the\nentire batch of European cars are so poor an affair that it is obvious their\nmakers never thought of them as something to look at. They are something to\nput on, like pants or a pullover. Theirs is the kind of space sought by the\nskin-diver, the water-skier, and the dinghy sailor. In an immediate tactile\nsense, this new space is akin to that to which the picture-window fad had\ncatered. In terms of “view,” the picture window never made any sense. In terms\nof an attempt to discover a new dimension in the out-of-doors by pretending to\nbe a goldfish, the picture window does make sense. So do the frantic efforts\nto roughen up the indoor walls and textures as if they were the outside of the\nhouse. Exactly the same impulse sends the indoor spaces and furniture out into\nthe patios in an attempt to experience the outside as inside. The TV viewer is\nin just that role at all times. He is submarine. He is bombarded by atoms that\nreveal the outside as inside in an endless adventure amidst blurred images and\nmysterious contours.\n\nHowever, the American car has been fashioned in accordance with the _visual_\nmandates of the typographic and the movie images. The American car was an\nenclosed space, not a tactile space. And an enclosed space, as was shown in\nthe chapter on Print, is one in which all spatial qualities have been reduced\nto visual terms. So in the American car, as the French observed decades ago,\n“one is not on the road, one is in the car.” By contrast, the European car\naims to drag you along the road and to provide a great deal of vibration for\nthe bottom. Brigitte Bardot got into the news when it was discovered that she\nliked to drive barefoot in order to get maximal vibration. Even English cars,\nweak on visual appearance as they are, have been guilty of advertising that\n“at sixty miles an hour all you can hear is the ticking of the clock.” That\nwould be a very poor ad, indeed, for a TV generation that has to be _with_\neverything and has to _dig_ things in order to get at them. So avid is the TV\nviewer for rich tactile effects that he could be counted on to revert to skis.\nThe wheel, so far as he is concerned, lacks the requisite abrasiveness.\n\nClothes in this first TV decade repeat the same story as vehicles. The\nrevolution was heralded by bobby-soxers who dumped the whole cargo of visual\neffects for a set of tactile ones so extreme as to create a dead level of\nflat-footed deadpanism. Part of the cool dimension of TV is the cool, deadpan\nmug that came in with the teenager. Adolescence, in the age of hot media, of\nradio and movie, and of the ancient book, had been a time of fresh, eager, and\nexpressive countenances. No elder statesman or senior executive of the 1940s\nwould have ventured to wear so dead and sculptural a pan as the child of the\nTV age. The dances that came in with TV were to match—all the way to the\nTwist, which is merely a form of very unanimated dialogue, the gestures and\ngrimaces of which indicate involvement in depth, but “nothing to say.”\n\nClothing and styling in the past decade have gone so tactile and sculptural\nthat they present a sort of exaggerated evidence of the new qualities of the\nTV mosaic. The TV extension of our nerves in hirsute pattern possesses the\npower to evoke a flood of related imagery in clothing, hairdo, walk, and\ngesture.\n\nAll this adds up to the compressional implosion — the return to nonspecialized\nforms of clothes and spaces, the seeking of multi-uses for rooms and things\nand objects, in a single word—the iconic. In music and poetry and painting,\nthe tactile implosion means the insistence on qualities that are close to\ncasual speech. Thus Schönberg and Stravinsky and Carl Orff and Bartok, far\nfrom being advanced seekers of esoteric effects, seem now to have brought\nmusic very close to the condition of ordinary human speech. It is this\ncolloquial rhythm that once seemed so unmelodious about their work. Anyone who\nlistens to the medieval works of Perotinus or Dufay will find them very close\nto Stravinsky and Bartok. The great explosion of the Renaissance that split\nmusical instruments off from song and speech and gave them specialist\nfunctions is now being played backward in our age of electronic implosion.\n\nOne of the most vivid examples of the tactile quality of the TV image occurs\nin medical experience. In closedcircuit instruction in surgery, medical\nstudents from the first reported a strange effect — that they seemed not to be\nwatching an operation, but performing it. They felt that they were holding the\nscalpel. Thus the TV image, in fostering a passion for depth involvement in\nevery aspect of experience, creates an obsession with bodily welfare. The\nsudden emergence of the TV medico and the hospital ward as a program to rival\nthe western is perfectly natural. It would be possible to list a dozen untried\nkinds of programs that would prove immediately popular for the same reasons.\nTom Dooley and his epic of Medicare for the backward society was a natural\noutgrowth of the first TV decade.\n\nNow that we have considered the subliminal force of the TV image in a\nredundant scattering of samples, the question would seem to arise: \"“What\npossible _immunity_ can there be from the subliminal operation of a new medium\nlike television?”\" People have long supposed that bulldog opacity, backed by\nfirm disapproval, is adequate enough protection against any new experience. It\nis the theme of this book that not even the most lucid understanding of the\npeculiar force of a medium can head off the ordinary “closure” of the senses\nthat causes us to conform to the pattern of experience presented. The utmost\npurity of mind is no defense against bacteria, though the confreres of Louis\nPasteur tossed him out of the medical profession for his base allegations\nabout the invisible operation of bacteria. To resist TV, therefore, one must\nacquire the antidote of related media like print.\n\nIt is an especially touchy area that presents itself with the question: \"“What\nhas been the effect of TV on our political life?”\" Here, at least, great\ntraditions of critical awareness and vigilance testify to the safeguards we\nhave posted against the dastardly uses of power.\n\nWhen Theodore White’s The Making of the President: 1960 is opened at the\nsection on “The Television Debates,” the TV student will experience dismay.\nWhite offers statistics on the number of sets in American homes and the number\nof hours of daily use of these sets, but not one clue as to the nature of the\nTV image or its effects on candidates or viewers. White considers the\n“content” of the debates and the deportment of the debaters, but it never\noccurs to him to ask why TV would inevitably be a disaster for a sharp intense\nimage like Nixon’s, and a boon for the blurry, shaggy texture of Kennedy.\n\nAt the end of the debates, Philip Deane of the London Observer explained my\nidea of the coming TV impact on the election to the Toronto Globe and Mail\nunder the headline of “The Sheriff and the Lawyer,” October 15, 1960. It was\nthat TV would prove so entirely in Kennedy’s favor that he would win the\nelection. Without TV, Nixon had it made. Deane, toward the end of his article,\nwrote:\n\n> Now the press has tended to say that Mr. Nixon has been gaining in the last\n> two debates and that he was bad in the first. Professor McLuhan thinks that\n> Mr. Nixon has been sounding progressively more definite; regardless of the\n> value of the Vice-President’s views and principles, he has been defending\n> them with too much flourish for the TV medium. Mr. Kennedy’s rather sharp\n> responses have been a mistake, but he still presents an image closer to the\n> TV hero, Professor McLuhan says — something like the shy young Sheriff —\n> while Mr. Nixon with his very dark eyes that tend to stare, with his slicker\n> circumlocution, has resembled more the railway lawyer who signs leases that\n> are not in the interests of the folks in the little town.\n>\n> In fact, by counterattacking and by claiming for himself, as he does in the\n> TV debates, the same goals as the Democrats have, Mr. Nixon may be helping\n> his opponent by blurring the Kennedy image, by confusing what exactly it is\n> that Mr. Kennedy wants to change.\n>\n> Mr. Kennedy is thus not handicapped by clear-cut issues; he is visually a\n> less well-defined image, and appears more nonchalant. He seems less anxious\n> to sell himself than does Mr. Nixon. So far, then, Professor McLuhan gives\n> Mr. Kennedy the lead without underestimating Mr. Nixon’s formidable appeal\n> to the vast conservative forces of the United States.\n\nAnother way of explaining the acceptable, as opposed to the unacceptable, TV\npersonality is to say that anybody whose _appearance_ strongly declares his\nrole and status in life is wrong for TV. Anybody who looks as if he might be a\nteacher, a doctor, a businessman, or any of a dozen other things all at the\nsame time is right for TV. When the person presented _looks_ classifiable, as\nNixon did, the TV viewer has nothing to fill in. He feels uncomfortable with\nhis TV image. He says uneasily, \"“There’s something about the guy that isn’t\nright.”\" The viewer feels exactly the same about an exceedingly pretty girl on\nTV, or about any of the intense “high definition” images and messages from the\nsponsors. It is not accidental that advertising has become a vast new source\nof comic effects since the advent of TV. Mr. Khrushchev is a very filled-in or\ncompleted image that appears on TV as a comic cartoon. In wirephoto and on TV,\nMr. Khrushchev is a jovial comic, an entirely disarming presence. Likewise,\nprecisely the formula that recommends anybody for a movie role disqualifies\nthat same person for TV acceptance. For the hot movie medium needs people who\nlook very definitely a type of some kind. The cool TV medium cannot abide the\ntypical because it leaves the viewer frustrated of his job of “closure” or\ncompletion of image. President Kennedy did not look like a rich man or like a\npolitician. He could have been anything from a grocer or a professor to a\nfootball coach. He was not too precise or too ready of speech in such a way as\nto spoil his pleasantly tweedy blur of countenance and outline. He went from\npalace to log cabin, from wealth to the White House, in a pattern of TV\nreversal and upset.\n\nThe same components will be found in any popular TV figure. Ed Sullivan, \"“the\ngreat stone face,”\" as he was known from the first, has the much needed\nharshness of texture and general sculptural quality demanded for serious\nregard on TV. Jack Paar is quite otherwise—neither shaggy nor sculptural. But\non the other hand, his presence is entirely acceptable on TV because of his\nutterly cool and casual verbal agility. The Jack Paar show revealed the\ninherent need of TV for spontaneous chat and dialogue. Jack discovered how to\nextend the TV mosaic image into the entire format of his show, seemingly\nsnaffling up just anybody from anywhere at the drop of a hat. In fact,\nhowever, he understood very well how to create a mosaic from other media, from\nthe world of journalism and politics, books, Broadway, and the arts in\ngeneral, until he became a formidable rival to the press mosaic itself. As\n“Amos and Andy” had lowered church attendance on Sunday evenings in the old\ndays of radio, so Jack Paar certainly cut night-club patronage with his late\nshow.\n\nHow about Educational Television? When the three-year-old sits watching the\nPresident’s press conference with Dad and Grandad, that illustrates the\nserious educational role of TV. If we ask what is the relation of TV to the\nlearning process, the answer is surely that the TV image, by its stress on\nparticipation, dialogue, and depth, has brought to America new demand for\ncrash-programming in education. Whether there ever will be TV in every\nclassroom is a small matter. The revolution has already taken place at home.\nTV has changed our sense-lives and our mental processes. It has created a\ntaste for all experience in _depth_ that affects language teaching as much as\ncar styles. Since TV, nobody is happy with a mere book knowledge of French or\nEnglish poetry. The unanimous cry now is, “Let’s _talk_ French,” and “Let the\nbard be _heard_.” And oddly enough, with the demand for depth, goes the demand\nfor crash-programming. Not only deeper, but further, into all knowledge has\nbecome the normal popular demand since TV. Perhaps enough has been said about\nthe nature of the TV image to explain why this should be. How could it\npossibly pervade our lives any more than it does? Mere classroom use could not\nextend its influence. Of course, in the classroom its role compels a\nreshuffling of subjects, and approaches to subjects. Merely to put the present\nclassroom on TV would be like putting movies on TV. The result would be a\nhybrid that is neither. The right approach is to ask, \"“What can TV do that\nthe classroom cannot do for French, or for physics?”\" The answer is: \"“TV can\nillustrate the interplay of process and the growth of forms of all kinds as\nnothing else can.”\"\n\nThe other side of the story concerns the fact that, in the visually organized\neducational and social world, the TV child is an underprivileged cripple. An\noblique indication of this startling reversal has been given by William\nGolding’s Lord of the Flies. On the one hand, it is very flattering for hordes\nof docile children to be told that, once out of the sight of their\ngovernesses, the seething savage passions within them would boil over and\nsweep away pram and playpen, alike. On the other hand, Mr. Golding’s little\npastoral parable does have some meaning in terms of the psychic changes in the\nTV child. This matter is so important for any future strategy of culture or\npolitics that it demands a headline prominence, and capsulated summary:\n\n## Why The TV Child Cannot See Ahead\n\nThe plunge into depth experience via the TV image can only be explained in\nterms of the differences between visual and mosaic space. Ability to\ndiscriminate between these radically different forms is quite rare in our\nWestern world. It has been pointed out that, in the country of the blind, the\none-eyed man is not king. He is taken to be an hallucinated lunatic. In a\nhighly visual culture, it is as difficult to communicate the nonvisual\nproperties of spatial forms as to explain visuality to the blind. In The ABC\nof Relativity Bertrand Russell began by explaining that there is nothing\ndifficult about Einstein’s ideas, but that they do call for total\nreorganization of our imaginative lives. It is precisely this imaginative\nreorganization that has occurred via the TV image.\n\nThe ordinary inability to discriminate between the photographic and the TV\nimage is not merely a crippling factor in the learning process today; it is\nsymptomatic of an age-old failure in Western culture. The literate man,\naccustomed to an environment in which the visual sense is extended everywhere\nas a principle of organization, sometimes supposes that the mosaic world of\nprimitive art, or even the world of Byzantine art, represents a mere\ndifference in degree, a sort of failure to bring their visual portrayals up to\nthe level of full visual effectiveness. Nothing could be further from the\ntruth. This, in fact, is a misconception that has impaired understanding\nbetween East and West for many centuries. Today it impairs relations between\ncolored and white societies.\n\nMost technology produces an amplification that is quite explicit in its\nseparation of the senses. Radio is an extension of the aural, high-fidelity\nphotography of the visual. But TV is, above all, an extension of the sense of\ntouch, which involves maximal interplay of all the senses. For Western man,\nhowever, the all-embracing extension had occurred by means of phonetic\nwriting, which is a technology for extending the sense of sight. All non-\nphonetic forms of writing are, by contrast, artistic modes that retain much\nvariety of sensuous orchestration. Phonetic writing, alone, has the power of\nseparating and fragmenting the senses and of sloughing off the semantic\ncomplexities. The TV image reverses this literate process of analytic\nfragmentation of sensory life.\n\nThe visual stress on continuity, uniformity, and connectedness, as it derives\nfrom literacy, confronts us with the great technological means of implementing\ncontinuity and lineality by fragmented repetition. The ancient world found\nthis means in the brick, whether for wall or road. The repetitive, uniform\nbrick, indispensable agent of road and wall, of cities and empires, is an\nextension, via letters, of the visual sense. _The brick wall is not a mosaic\nform_ , and neither is the mosaic form a visual structure. The mosaic can be\n_seen_ as dancing can, but is not _structured_ visually; nor is it an\nextension of the visual power. For the mosaic is not uniform, continuous, or\nrepetitive. It is discontinuous, skew, and nonlineal, like the tactual TV\nimage. To the sense of touch, all things are sudden, counter, original, spare,\nstrange. The “Pied Beauty” of G. M. Hopkins is a catalogue of the notes of the\nsense of touch. The poem is a manifesto of the nonvisual, and like Cézanne or\nSeurat, or Rouault it provides an indispensable approach to understanding TV.\nThe nonvisual mosaic structures of modern art, like those of modern physics\nand electric-information patterns, permit little detachment. The mosaic form\nof the TV image demands participation and involvement in depth of the whole\nbeing, as does the sense of touch. Literacy, in contrast, had, by extending\nthe visual power to the uniform organization of time and space, psychically\nand socially, conferred the power of detachment and noninvolvement.\n\nThe visual sense when extended by phonetic literacy fosters the analytic habit\nof perceiving the single facet in the life of forms. The visual power enables\nus to isolate the single incident in time and space, as in representational\nart. In visual representation of a person or an object, a single phase or\nmoment or aspect is separated from the multitude of known and felt phases,\nmoments and aspects of the person or object. By contrast, iconographic art\nuses the eye as we use our hand in seeking to create an inclusive image, made\nup of many moments, phases, and aspects of the person or thing. Thus the\niconic mode is not visual representation, nor the specialization of visual\nstress as defined by viewing from a single position. The tactual mode of\nperceiving is sudden but not specialist. It is total, synesthetic, involving\nall the senses. Pervaded by the mosaic TV image, the TV child encounters the\nworld in a spirit antithetic to literacy.\n\nThe TV image, that is to say, even more than the icon, is an extension of the\nsense of touch. Where it encounters a literate culture, it necessarily\nthickens the sense-mix, transforming fragmented and specialist extensions into\na seamless web of experience. Such transformation is, of course, a “disaster”\nfor a literate, specialist culture. It blurs many cherished attitudes and\nprocedures. It dims the efficacy of the basic pedagogic techniques, and the\nrelevance of the curriculum. If for no other reason, it would be well to\nunderstand the dynamic life of these forms as they intrude upon us and upon\none another. TV makes for myopia.\n\nThe young people who have experienced a decade of TV have naturally imbibed an\nurge toward involvement in depth that makes all the remote visualized goals of\nusual culture seem not only unreal but irrelevant, and not only irrelevant but\nanemic. It is the total involvement in all-inclusive _nowness_ that occurs in\nyoung lives via TV’s mosaic image. This change of attitude has nothing to do\nwith programming in any way, and would be the same if the programs consisted\nentirely of the highest cultural content. The change in attitude by means of\nrelating themselves to the mosaic TV image would occur in any event. It is, of\ncourse, our job not only to understand this change but to exploit it for its\npedagogical richness. The TV child expects involvement and doesn’t want a\nspecialist _job_ in the future. He does want a _role_ and a deep commitment to\nhis society. Unbridled and misunderstood, this richly human need can manifest\nitself in the distorted forms portrayed in West Side Story.\n\nThe TV child cannot see ahead because he wants involvement, and he cannot\naccept a fragmentary and merely visualized goal or destiny in learning or in\nlife.\n\n## Murder by Television\n\nJack Ruby shot Lee Oswald while tightly surrounded by guards who were\nparalyzed by television cameras. The fascinating and involving power of\ntelevision scarcely needed this additional proof of its peculiar operation\nupon human perceptions. The Kennedy assassination gave people an immediate\nsense of the television power to create depth involvement, on the one hand,\nand a numbing effect as deep as grief, itself, on the other hand. Most people\nwere amazed at the depth of meaning which the event communicated to them. Many\nmore were surprised by the coolness and calm of the mass reaction. The same\nevent, handled by press or radio (in the absence of television), would have\nprovided a totally different experience. The national “lid” would have “blown\noff.” Excitement would have been enormously greater and depth participation in\na common awareness very much less.\n\nAs explained earlier, Kennedy was an excellent TV image. He had used the\nmedium with the same effectiveness that Roosevelt had learned to achieve by\nradio. With TV, Kennedy found it natural to involve the nation in the office\nof the Presidency, both as an operation and as an image. TV reaches out for\nthe corporate attributes of office. Potentially, it can transform the\nPresidency into a monarchic dynasty. A merely elective Presidency scarcely\naffords the depth of dedication and commitment demanded by the TV form. Even\nteachers on TV seem to be endowed by the student audiences with a charismatic\nor mystic character that much exceeds the feelings developed in the classroom\nor lecture hall. In the course of many studies of audience reactions to TV\nteaching, there recurs this puzzling fact. The viewers feel that the teacher\nhas a dimension of almost sacredness. This feeling does not have its basis in\nconcepts or ideas, but seems to creep in uninvited and unexplained. It baffles\nboth the students and the analysts of their reactions. Surely, there could be\nno more telling touch to tip us off to the character of TV. This is not so\nmuch a visual as a tactual-auditory medium that involves all of our senses in\ndepth interplay. For people long accustomed to the merely visual experience of\nthe typographic and photographic varieties, it would seem to be the\n_synesthesia_ , or tactual depth of TV experience, that dislocates them from\ntheir usual attitudes of passivity and detachment.\n\nThe banal and ritual remark of the conventionally literate, that TV presents\nan experience for passive viewers, is wide of the mark. TV is above all a\nmedium that demands a creatively participant response. The guards who failed\nto protect Lee Oswald were not passive. They were so involved by the mere\nsight of the TV cameras that they lost their sense of their merely practical\nand specialist task.\n\nPerhaps it was the Kennedy funeral that most strongly impressed the audience\nwith the power of TV to invest an occasion with the character of corporate\nparticipation. No national event except in sports has ever had such coverage\nor such an audience. It revealed the unrivaled power of TV to achieve the\ninvolvement of the audience in a complex _process_. The funeral as a corporate\nprocess caused even the image of sport to pale and dwindle into puny\nproportions. The Kennedy funeral, in short, manifested the power of TV to\ninvolve an entire population in a ritual process. By comparison, press, movie\nand even radio are mere packaging devices for consumers.\n\nMost of all, the Kennedy event provides an opportunity for noting a\nparadoxical feature of the “cool” TV medium. It involves us in moving depth,\nbut it does not excite, agitate or arouse. Presumably, this is a feature of\nall depth experience.\n\n\n![Weapons: War of the Icons](images/title-32.png)\n\nWhen the Russian girl Valentina Tereshkova, quite without pilot training, went\ninto orbit on June 16, 1963, her action, as reacted to in the press and other\nmedia, was a kind of defacing of the images of the male astronauts, especially\nthe Americans. Shunning the expertise of American astronauts, all of whom were\nqualified test pilots, the Russians don’t seem to feel that space travel is\nrelated enough to the airplane to require a pilot’s “wings.” Since our culture\nforbids the sending of a woman into orbit, our only repartee would have been\nto launch into orbit a group of space children, to indicate that it is, after\nall, child’s play.\n\nThe first sputnik or \"“little fellow-traveler”\" was a witty taunting of the\ncapitalist world by means of a new kind of technological image or icon, for\nwhich a group of children in orbit might yet be a telling retort. Plainly, the\nfirst lady astronaut is offered to the West as a little Valentine-or heart\nthrob — suited to our sentimentality. In fact, the war of the icons, or the\neroding of the collective countenance of one’s rivals, has long been under\nway. Ink and photo are supplanting soldiery and tanks. The pen daily becomes\nmightier than the sword.\n\nThe French phrase _“guerre des nerfs”_ of twenty-five years ago has since come\nto be referred to as “the cold war.” It is really an electric battle of\ninformation and of images that goes far deeper and is more obsessional than\nthe old hot wars of industrial hardware.\n\nThe “hot” wars of the past used weapons that knocked off the enemy, one by\none. Even ideological warfare in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\nproceeded by persuading individuals to adopt new points of view, one at a\ntime. Electric persuasion by photo and movie and TV works, instead, by dunking\nentire populations in new imagery. Full awareness of this technological change\nhad dawned on Madison Avenue ten years ago when it shifted its tactics from\nthe promotion of the individual product to the collective involvement in the\n“corporate image,” now altered to “corporate posture.”\n\nParallel to the new cold war of information exchange is the situation\ncommented on by James Reston in a New York Times release from Washington:\n\n> Politics has gone international. The British Labor Leader is here\n> campaigning for Prime Minister of Britain, and fairly soon John F. Kennedy\n> will be over in Italy and Germany campaigning for reelection. Everybody’s\n> now whistle-stopping through somebody else’s country, usually ours.\n>\n> Washington has still not adjusted to this third-man role. It keeps\n> forgetting that anything said here may be used by one side or another in\n> some election campaign, and that it may, by accident, be the decisive\n> element in the final vote.\n\nIf the cold war in 1964 is being fought by informational technology, that is\nbecause all wars have been fought by the latest technology available in any\nculture. In one of his sermons John Donne commented thankfully on the blessing\nof heavy firearms:\n\n> So by the benefit of this light of reason they have found out _Artillery_ ,\n> by which warres come to quicker ends than heretofore …\n\nThe scientific knowledge needed for the use of gunpowder and the boring of\ncannon appeared to Donne as \"“the light of reason.”\" He failed to notice\nanother advance in the same technology that hastened and extended the scope of\nhuman slaughter. It is referred to by John U. Nef in War and Human Progress:\n\n> The gradual abandonment or armor as a part of the equipment of soldiers\n> during the seventeenth century freed some metal supplies for the manufacture\n> of firearms and missiles.\n\nIt is easy to discover in this a seamless web of interwoven events when we\nturn to look at the psychic and social consequences of the technological\nextensions of man.\n\nBack in the 1920s King Amanullah seems to have put his finger on this web when\nhe said, after firing off a torpedo:\n\n\"“I feel half an Englishman already.”\"\n\nThe same sense of the relentlessly interwoven texture of human fate was\ntouched by the schoolboy who said:\n\n\"“Dad, I hate war.”\"\n\n\"“Why, son?”\"\n\n\"“Because war makes history, and I hate history.”\"\n\nThe techniques developed over the centuries for drilling gun-barrels provided\nthe means that made possible the steam engine. The piston shaft and the gun\npresented the same problems in boring hard steel. Earlier, it had been the\nlineal stress of perspective that had channeled perception in paths that led\nto the creation of gunfire. Long before guns, gunpowder had been used\nexplosively, dynamite style. The use of gunpowder for the propelling of\nmissiles in trajectories waited for the coming of perspective in the arts.\nThis liaison of events between technology and the arts may explain a matter\nthat has long puzzled anthropologists. They have repeatedly tried to explain\nthe fact that nonliterates are generally poor shots with rifles, on the\ngrounds that, with the bow and arrow, proximity to game was more important\nthan distant accuracy, which was almost impossible to achieve — hence, say\nsome anthropologists, their imitation of hunted beasts by dressing in skins to\nget close to the herd. It is also pointed out that bows are silent, and when\nan arrow missed, animals rarely fled.\n\nIf the arrow is an extension of the hand and the arm, the rifle is an\nextension of the eye and teeth. It may be to the point to remark that it was\nthe literate American colonists who were first to insist on a rifled barrel\nand improved gun-sights. They improved the old muskets, creating the Kentucky\nrifle. It was the highly literate Bostonians who outshot the British regulars.\nMarksmanship is not the gift of the native or the woodsman, but of the\nliterate colonist. So runs this argument that links gunfire itself with the\nrise of perspective, and with the extension of the visual power in literacy.\nIn the Marine Corps it has been found that there is a definite correlation\nbetween education and marksmanship. Not for the nonliterate is our easy\nselection of a separate, isolated target in space, with the rifle as an\nextension of the eye.\n\nIf gunpowder was known long before it was used for guns, the same is also true\nof the use of the lodestone or magnet. Its use in the compass for lineal\nnavigation had, also, to wait for the discovery of lineal perspective in the\narts. Navigators took a long time to accept the possibility of space as\nuniform, connected and continuous. Today in physics, as in painting and\nsculpture, progress consists in giving up the idea of space as either uniform,\ncontinuous, or connected. Visuality has lost its primacy.\n\nIn the Second World War the marksman was replaced by automatic weapons fired\nblindly in what were called \"“perimeters of fire”\" or \"“fire lanes.”\" The old-\ntimers fought to retain the bolt-action Springfield which encouraged single-\nshot accuracy and sighting. Spraying the air with lead in a kind of tactual\nembrace was found to be good by night, as well as by day, and sighting was\nunnecessary. At this stage of technology, the literate man is somewhat in the\nposition of the old-timers who backed the Springfield rifle against perimeter\nfire. It is this same visual habit that deters and obstructs literate man in\nmodern physics, as Milic Capek explains in The Philosophical Impact of Modern\nPhysics. Men in the older oral societies of middle Europe are better able to\nconceive the nonvisual velocities and relations of the subatomic world.\n\nOur highly literate societies are at a loss as they encounter the new\nstructures of opinion and feeling that result from instant and global\ninformation. They are still in the grip of “points of view” and of habits of\ndealing with things one at a time. Such habits are quite crippling in any\nelectric structure of information movement, yet they could be controlled if we\nrecognized whence they had been acquired. But literate society thinks of its\nartificial visual bias as a thing natural and innate.\n\nLiteracy remains even now the base and model of all programs of industrial\nmechanization; but, at the same time, it locks the minds and senses of its\nusers in the mechanical and fragmentary matrix that is so necessary to the\nmaintenance of mechanized society. That is why the transition from mechanical\nto electric technology is so very traumatic and severe for us all. The\nmechanical techniques, with their limited powers, we have long used as\nweapons. The electric techniques cannot be used aggressively except to end all\nlife at once, like the turning off of a light. To live with both of these\ntechnologies at the same time is the peculiar drama of the twentieth century.\n\nIn his Education Automation, R. Buckminster Fuller considers that weaponry has\nbeen a source of technological advance for mankind because it requires\ncontinually improved performance with ever smaller means. \"“As we went from\nthe ships of the sea to the ships of the air, the performance per pound of the\nequipment and fuel became of even higher importance than on the sea.”\"\n\nIt is this trend toward more and more power with less and less hardware that\nis characteristic of the electric age of information. Fuller has estimated\nthat in the first half century of the airplane the nations of the world have\ninvested two and a half trillion dollars by subsidy of the airplane as a\nweapon. He added that this amounts to sixty-two times the value of all the\ngold in the world. His approach to these problems is more technological than\nthe approach of historians, who have often tended to find that war produces\nnothing new in the way of invention.\n\n\"“This man will teach us how to beat him,”\" Peter the Great is said to have\nremarked after his army had been beaten by Charles XII of Sweden. Today, the\nbackward countries can learn from us how to beat us. In the new electric age\nof information, the backward countries enjoy some specific advantages over the\nhighly literate and industrialized cultures. For backward countries have the\nhabit and understanding of oral propaganda and persuasion that was eroded in\nindustrial societies long ago. The Russians had only to adapt their traditions\nof Eastern icon and image-building to the new electric media in order to be\naggressively effective in the modern world of information. The idea of the\nImage, that Madison Avenue has had to learn the hard way, was the only idea\navailable to Russian propaganda. The Russians have not shown imagination or\nresourcefulness in their propaganda. They have merely done that which their\nreligious and cultural traditions taught them; namely, to build images.\n\nThe city, itself, is traditionally a military weapon, and is a collective\nshield or plate armor, an extension of the castle of our very skins. Before\nthe huddle of the city, there was the food-gathering phase of man the hunter,\neven as men have now in the electric age returned psychically and socially to\nthe nomad state. Now, however, it is called information-gathering and data-\nprocessing. But it is global, and it ignores and replaces the form of the city\nwhich has, therefore, tended to become obsolete. With instant electric\ntechnology, the globe itself can never again be more than a village, and the\nvery nature of city as a form of major dimensions must inevitably dissolve\nlike a fading shot in a movie. The first circumnavigation of the globe in the\nRenaissance gave men a sense of embracing and possessing the earth that was\nquite new, even as the recent astronauts have again altered man’s relation to\nthe planet, reducing its scope to the extent of an evening’s stroll.\n\nThe city, like a ship, is a collective extension of the castle of our skins,\neven as clothing is an extension of our individual skins. But weapons proper\nare extensions of hands, nails, and teeth, and come into existence as tools\nneeded for accelerating the processing of matter. Today, when we live in a\ntime of sudden transition from mechanical to electric technology, it is easier\nto see the character of all previous technologies, we being detached from all\nof them for the time being. Since our new electric technology is not an\nextension of our bodies but of our central nervous systems, we now see all\ntechnology, including language, as a means of processing experience, a means\nof storing and speeding information. And in such a situation all technology\ncan plausibly be regarded as weapons. Previous wars can now be regarded as the\nprocessing of difficult and resistant materials by the latest technology, the\nspeedy dumping of industrial products on an enemy market to the point of\nsocial saturation. War, in fact, can be seen as a process of achieving\nequilibrium among unequal technologies, a fact that explains Toynbee’s puzzled\nobservation that each invention of a new weapon is a disaster for society, and\nthat militarism itself is the most common cause of the breaking of\ncivilizations.\n\nBy militarism, Rome extended civilization or individualism, literacy, and\nlineality to many oral and backward tribes. Even today the mere existence of a\nliterate and industrial West appears quite naturally as dire aggression to\nnonliterate societies; just as the mere existence of the atom bomb appears as\na state of universal aggression to industrial and mechanized societies.\n\nOn the one hand, a new weapon or technology looms as a threat to all who lack\nit. On the other hand, when everybody has the same technological aids, there\nbegins the competitive fury of the homogenized and the egalitarian pattern\nagainst which the strategy of social class and caste has often been used in\nthe past. For caste and class are techniques of social slow-down that tend to\ncreate the stasis of tribal societies. Today we appear to be poised between\ntwo ages — one of detribalization and one of retribalization.\n\n> Between the acting of a dreadful thing,\n>\n> And the first motion, all the interim is\n>\n> Like a Phantasma, or a hideous Dream:\n>\n> The genius and the mortal instruments\n>\n> Are then in council; and the state of man,\n>\n> Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then\n>\n> The nature of an insurrection.\n>\n> (Julius Caesar, Brutus II, i)\n\nIf mechanical technology as extension of parts of the human body had exerted a\nfragmenting force, psychically and socially, this fact appears nowhere more\nvividly than in mechanical weaponry. With the extension of the central nervous\nsystem by electric technology, even weaponry makes more vivid the fact of the\nunity of the human family. The very inclusiveness of information as a weapon\nbecomes a daily reminder that politics and history must be recast in the form\nof \"“the concretization of human fraternity.”\"\n\nThis dilemma of weaponry appears very clearly to Leslie Dewart in his\nChristianity and Revolution, when he points to the obsolescence of the\nfragmented balance-of-power techniques. As an instrument of policy, modern war\nhas come to mean \"“the existence and end of one society to the exclusion of\nanother.”\" At this point, weaponry is a self-liquidating fact.\n\n  *[XII]: Twelve\n\n\n![Automation: Learning a Living](images/title-33.png)\n\nA newspaper headline recently read, \"“Little Red Schoolhouse Dies When Good\nRoad Built.”\" One-room schools, with all subjects being taught to all grades\nat the same time, simply dissolve when better transportation permits\nspecialized spaces and specialized teaching. At the extreme of speeded-up\nmovement, however, specialism of space and subject disappears once more. With\nautomation, it is not only jobs that disappear, and complex roles that\nreappear. Centuries of specialist stress in pedagogy and in the arrangement of\ndata now end with the instantaneous retrieval of information made possible by\nelectricity. Automation is information and it not only ends jobs in the world\nof work, it ends subjects in the world of learning. It does not end the world\nof learning. The future of work consists of learning a living in the\nautomation age. This is a familiar pattern in electric technology in general.\nIt ends the old dichotomies between culture and technology, between art and\ncommerce, and between work and leisure. Whereas in the mechanical age of\nfragmentation leisure had been the absence of work, or mere idleness, the\nreverse is true in the electric age. As the age of information demands the\nsimultaneous use of all our faculties, we discover that we are most at leisure\nwhen we are most intensely involved, very much as with the artists in all\nages.\n\nIn terms of the industrial age, it can be pointed out that the difference\nbetween the previous mechanical age and the new electric age appears in the\ndifferent kinds of inventories. Since electricity, inventories are made up not\nso much of goods in storage as of materials in continuous process of\ntransformation at spatially removed sites. For electricity not only gives\nprimacy to _process_ , whether in making or in learning, but it makes\nindependent the source of energy from the location of the process. In\nentertainment media, we speak of this fact as “mass media” because the source\nof the program and the process of experiencing it are independent in space,\nyet simultaneous in time. In industry this basic fact causes the scientific\nrevolution that is called “automation” or “cybernation.”\n\nIn education the conventional division of the curriculum into subjects is\nalready as outdated as the medieval trivium and quadrivium after the\nRenaissance. Any subject taken in depth at once relates to others subjects.\nArithmetic in grade three or nine, when taught in terms of number theory,\nsymbolic logic, and cultural history, ceases to be mere practice in problems.\nContinued in their present patterns of fragmented unrelation, our school\ncurricula will insure a citizenry unable to understand the cybernated world in\nwhich they live.\n\nMost scientists are quite aware that since we have acquired some knowledge of\nelectricity it is not possible to speak of atoms as pieces of matter. Again,\nas more is known about electrical “discharges” and energy, there is less and\nless tendency to speak of electricity as a thing that “flows” like water\nthrough a wire, or is “contained” in a battery. Rather, the tendency is to\nspeak of electricity as painters speak of space; namely, that it is a variable\ncondition that involves the special positions of two or more bodies. There is\nno longer any tendency to speak of electricity as “contained” in anything.\nPainters have long known that objects are not contained in space, but that\nthey generate their own spaces. It was the dawning awareness of this in the\nmathematical world a century ago that enabled Lewis Carroll, the Oxford\nmathematician, to contrive Alice in Wonderland, in which times and spaces are\nneither uniform nor continuous, as they had seemed to be since the arrival of\nRenaissance perspective. As for the speed of light, that is merely the speed\nof total causality.\n\nIt is a principal aspect of the electric age that it establishes a global\nnetwork that has much of the character of our central nervous system. Our\ncentral nervous system is not merely an electric network, but it constitutes a\nsingle unified field of experience. As biologists point out, the brain is the\ninteracting place where all kinds of impressions and experiences can be\nexchanged and translated, enabling us to _react to the world as a whole_.\nNaturally, when electric technology comes into play, the upmost variety and\nextent of operations in industry and society quickly assume a unified posture.\nYet this organic unity of interprocess that electromagnetism inspires in the\nmost diverse and specialized areas and organs of action is quite the opposite\nof organization in a mechanized society. Mechanization of any process is\nachieved by fragmentation, beginning with the mechanization of writing by\nmovable types, which has been called \"“the monofracture of manufacture.”\"\n\nThe electric telegraph, when crossed with typography, created the strange new\nform of the modern newspaper. Any page of the telegraph press is a\nsurrealistic mosaic of bits of “human interest” in vivid interaction. Such was\nthe art form of Chaplin and the early silent movies. Here, too, an extreme\nspeedup of mechanization, an assembly line of still shots on celluloid, led to\na strange reversal. The movie mechanism, aided by the electric light, created\nthe illusion of organic form and movement as much as a fixed position had\ncreated the illusion of perspective on a flat surface five hundred years\nbefore.\n\nThe same thing happens less superficially when the electric principle crosses\nthe mechanical lines of industrial organization. Automation retains only as\nmuch of the mechanical character as the motorcar kept of the forms of the\nhorse and the carriage. Yet people discuss automation as if we had not passed\nthe oat barrier, and as if the horse-vote at the next poll would sweep away\nthe automation regime.\n\nAutomation is not an extension of the mechanical principles of fragmentation\nand separation of operations. It is rather the invasion of the mechanical\nworld by the instantaneous character of electricity. That is why those\ninvolved in automation insist that it is a way of thinking, as much as it is a\nway of doing. Instant synchronization of numerous operations has ended the old\nmechanical pattern of setting up operations in lineal sequence. The assembly\nline has gone the way of the stag line. Nor is it just the lineal and\nsequential aspect of mechanical analysis that has been erased by the electric\nspeedup and exact synchronizing of information that is automation.\n\nAutomation or cybernation deals with all the units and components of the\nindustrial and marketing process exactly as radio or TV combine the\nindividuals in the audience into new interprocess. The new kind of\ninterrelation in both industry and entertainment is the result of the electric\ninstant speed. Our new electric technology now extends the instant processing\nof knowledge by interrelation that has long occurred within our central\nnervous system. It is that same speed that constitutes “organic unity” and\nends the mechanical age that had gone into high gear with Gutenberg.\nAutomation brings in real “mass production,” not in terms of size, but of an\ninstant inclusive embrace. Such is also the character of “mass media.” They\nare an indication, not of the size of their audiences, but of the fact that\neverybody becomes involved in them at the same time. Thus commodity industries\nunder automation share the same structural character of the entertainment\nindustries in the degree that both approximate the condition of instant\ninformation. Automation affects not just production, but every phase of\nconsumption and marketing; for the consumer becomes producer in the automation\ncircuit, quite as much as the reader of the mosaic telegraph press makes his\nown news, or just is his own news.\n\nBut there is a component in the automation story that is as basic as tactility\nto the TV image. It is the fact that, in any automatic machine, or galaxy of\nmachines and functions, the generation and transmission of power is quite\nseparate from the work operation that uses the power. The same is true in all\nservo-mechanist structures that involve feedback. The source of energy is\nseparate from the process of translation of information, or the applying of\nknowledge. This is obvious in the telegraph, where the energy and channel are\nquite independent of whether the written code is French or German. The same\nseparation of power and process obtains in automated industry, or in\n“cybernation.” The electric energy can be applied indifferently and quickly to\nmany kinds of tasks.\n\nSuch was never the case in the mechanical systems. The power and the work done\nwere always in direct relation, whether it was hand and hammer, water and\nwheel, horse and cart, or steam and piston. Electricity brought a strange\nelasticity in this matter, much as light itself illuminates a total field and\ndoes not dictate what shall be done. The same light can make possible a\nmultiplicity of tasks, just as with electric power. Light is a nonspecialist\nkind of energy or power that is identical with information and knowledge. Such\nis also the relation of electricity to automation, since both energy and\ninformation can be applied in a great variety of ways.\n\nGrasp of this fact is indispensable to the understanding of the electronic\nage, and of automation in particular. Energy and production now tend to fuse\nwith information and learning. Marketing and consumption tend to become one\nwith learning, enlightenment, and the intake of information. This is all part\nof the electric _implosion_ that now follows or succeeds the centuries of\n_explosion_ and increasing specialism. The electronic age is literally one of\nillumination. Just as light is at once energy and information, so electric\nautomation unites production, consumption, and learning in an inextricable\nprocess. For this reason, teachers are already the largest employee group in\nthe U.S. economy, and may well become the _only_ group.\n\nThe very same process of automation that causes a withdrawal of the present\nwork force from industry causes learning itself to become the principal kind\nof production and consumption. Hence the folly of alarm about unemployment.\nPaid learning is already becoming both the dominant employment and the source\nof new wealth in our society. This is the new _role_ for men in society,\nwhereas the older mechanistic idea of “jobs,” or fragmented tasks and\nspecialist slots for “workers,” becomes meaningless under automation.\n\nIt has often been said by engineers that, as information levels rise, almost\nany sort of material can be adapted to any sort of use. This principle is the\nkey to the understanding of electric automation. In the case of electricity,\nas energy for production becomes independent of the work operation, there is\nnot only the speed that makes for total and organic interplay, but there is,\nalso, the fact that electricity is sheer information that, in actual practice,\nilluminates all it touches. Any process that approaches instant interrelation\nof a total field tends to raise itself to the level of conscious awareness, so\nthat computers seem to “think.” In fact, they are highly specialized at\npresent, and quite lacking in the full process of interrelation that makes for\nconsciousness. Obviously, they can be made to simulate the process of\nconsciousness, just as our electric global networks now begin to simulate the\ncondition of our central nervous system. But a conscious computer would still\nbe one that was an extension of our consciousness, as a telescope is an\nextension of our eyes, or as a ventriloquist’s dummy is an extension of the\nventriloquist.\n\nAutomation certainly assumes the servomechanism and the computer. That is to\nsay, it assumes electricity as store and expediter of information. These\ntraits of store, or “memory,” and accelerator are the basic features of any\nmedium of communication whatever. In the case of electricity, it is not\ncorporeal substance that is stored or moved, but perception and information.\nAs for technological acceleration, it now approaches the speed of light. All\nnonelectric media had merely hastened things a bit. The wheel, the road, the\nship, the airplane, and even the space rocket are utterly lacking in the\ncharacter of instant movement. Is it strange, then, that electricity should\nconfer on all previous human organization a completely new character? The very\ntoil of man now becomes a kind of enlightenment. As unfallen Adam in the\nGarden of Eden was appointed the task of the contemplation and naming of\ncreatures, so with automation. We have now only to name and program a process\nor a product in order for it to be accomplished. Is it not rather like the\ncase of Al Capp’s Schmoos? One had only to look at a Schmoo and think\nlongingly of pork chops or caviar, and the Schmoo ecstatically transformed\nitself into the object of desire. Automation brings us into the world of the\nSchmoo. The custom-built supplants the mass-produced.\n\nLet us, as the Chinese say, move our chairs closer to the fire and see what we\nare saying. The electric changes associated with automation have nothing to do\nwith ideologies or social programs. If they had, they could be delayed or\ncontrolled. Instead, the technological extension of our central nervous system\nthat we call the electric media began more than a century ago, subliminally.\nSubliminal have been the effects. Subliminal they remain. At no period in\nhuman culture have men understood the psychic mechanisms involved in invention\nand technology. Today it is the instant speed of electric information that,\nfor the first time, permits easy recognition of the patterns and the formal\ncontours of change and development. The entire world, past and present, now\nreveals itself to us like a growing plant in an enormously accelerated movie.\nElectric speed is synonymous with light and with the understanding of causes.\nSo, with the use of electricity in previously mechanized situations, men\neasily discover causal connections and patterns that were quite unobservable\nat the slower rates of mechanical change. If we play backward the long\ndevelopment of literacy and printing and their effects on social experience\nand organization, we can easily see how these forms brought about that high\ndegree of social uniformity and homogeneity of society that is indispensable\nfor mechanical industry. Play them backward, and we get just that shock of\nunfamiliarity in the familiar that is necessary for the understanding of the\nlife of forms. Electricity compels us to play our mechanical development\nbackward, for it reverses much of that development. Mechanization depends on\nthe breaking up of processes into homogenized but unrelated bits. Electricity\nunifies these fragments once more because its speed of operation requires a\nhigh degree of interdependence among all phases of any operation. It is this\nelectric speedup and interdependence that has ended the assembly line in\nindustry.\n\nThis same need for organic interrelation, brought in by the electric speed of\nsynchronization, now requires us to perform, industry-by-industry, and\ncountry-by-country, exactly the same organic interrelating that was first\neffected in the individual automated unit. Electric speed requires organic\nstructuring of the global economy quite as much as early mechanization by\nprint and by road led to the acceptance of national unity. Let us not forget\nthat nationalism was a mighty invention and revolution that, in the\nRenaissance, wiped out many of the local regions and loyalties. It was a\nrevolution achieved almost entirely by the speedup of information by means of\nuniform movable types. Nationalism cut across most of the traditional power\nand cultural groupings that had slowly grown up in various regions. Multi-\nnationalisms had long deprived Europe of its economic unity. The Common Market\ncame to it only with the Second War. War is accelerated social change, as an\nexplosion is an accelerated chemical reaction and movement of matter. With\nelectric speeds governing industry and social life, explosion in the sense of\ncrash development becomes normal. On the other hand, the old-fashioned kind of\n“war” becomes as impracticable as playing hopscotch with bulldozers. Organic\ninterdependence means that disruption of any part of the organism can prove\nfatal to the whole. Every industry has had to “rethink through” (the\nawkwardness of this phrase betrays the painfulness of the process), function\nby function, its place in the economy. But automation forces not only industry\nand town planners, but government and even education, to come into some\nrelation to social facts.\n\nThe various military branches have had to come into line with automation very\nquickly. The unwieldy mechanical forms of military organization have gone.\nSmall teams of experts have replaced the citizen armies of yesterday even\nfaster than they have taken over the reorganization of industry. Uniformly\ntrained and homogenized citizenry, so long in preparation and so necessary to\na mechanized society, is becoming quite a burden and problem to an automated\nsociety, for automation and electricity require depth approaches in all fields\nand at all times. Hence the sudden rejection of standardized goods and scenery\nand living and education in America since the Second War. It is a switch\nimposed by electric technology in general, and by the TV image in particular.\n\nAutomation was first felt and seen on a large scale in the chemical industries\nof gas, coal, oil, and metallic ores. The large changes in these operations\nmade possible by electric energy have now, by means of the computer, begun to\ninvade every kind of white-collar and management area. Many people, in\nconsequence, have begun to look on the whole of society as a single unified\nmachine for creating wealth. Such has been the normal outlook of the\nstockbroker, manipulating shares and information with the cooperation of the\nelectric media of press, radio, telephone, and teletype. But the peculiar and\nabstract manipulation of information as a means of creating wealth is no\nlonger a monopoly of the stockbroker. It is now shared by every engineer and\nby the entire communications industries. With electricity as energizer and\nsynchronizer, all aspects of production, consumption, and organization become\nincidental to communications. The very idea of communication as interplay is\ninherent in the electrical, which combines both energy and information in its\nintensive manifold.\n\nAnybody who begins to examine the patterns of automation finds that perfecting\nthe individual machine by making it automatic involves “feedback.” That means\nintroducing an information loop or circuit, where before there had been merely\na one-way flow or mechanical sequence. Feedback is the end of the lineality\nthat came into the Western world with the alphabet and the continuous forms of\nEuclidean space. Feedback or dialogue between the mechanism and its\nenvironment brings a further weaving of individual machines into a galaxy of\nsuch machines throughout the entire plant. There follows a still further\nweaving of individual plants and factories into the entire industrial matrix\nof materials and services of a culture. Naturally, this last stage encounters\nthe entire world of policy, since to deal with the whole industrial complex as\nan organic system affects employment, security, education, and politics,\ndemanding full understanding in advance of coming structural change. There is\nno room for witless assumptions and subliminal factors in such electrical and\ninstant organizations.\n\nAs artists began a century ago to construct their works backward, _starting\nwith the effect_ , so now with industry and planning. In general, electric\nspeedup requires complete knowledge of ultimate effects. Mechanical speedups,\nhowever radical in their reshaping of personal and social life, still were\nallowed to happen sequentially. Men could, for the most part, get through a\nnormal life span on the basis of a single set of skills. That is not at all\nthe case with electric speedup. The acquiring of new basic knowledge and skill\nby senior executives in middle age is one of the most common needs and\nharrowing facts of electric technology. The senior executives, or “big\nwheels,” as they are archaically and ironically designated, are among the\nhardest pressed and most persistently harassed groups in human history.\nElectricity has not only demanded ever deeper knowledge and faster interplay,\nbut has made the harmonizing of production schedules as rigorous as that\ndemanded of the members of a large symphony orchestra. And the satisfactions\nare just as few for the big executives as for the symphonists, since a player\nin a big orchestra can hear nothing of the music that reaches the audience. He\ngets only noise.\n\nThe result of electric speedup in industry at large is the creation of intense\nsensitivity to the interrelation and interprocess of the whole, so as to call\nfor ever-new types of organization and talent. Viewed from the old\nperspectives of the machine age, this electric network of plants and processes\nseems brittle and tight. In fact, it is not mechanical, and it does begin to\ndevelop the sensitivity and pliability of the human organism. But it also\ndemands the same varied nutriment and nursing as the animal organism.\n\nWith the instant and complex interprocesses of the organic form, automated\nindustry also acquires the power of adaptability to multiple uses. A machine\nset up for the automatic production of electric bulbs represents a combination\nof processes that were previously managed by several machines. With a single\nattendant, it can run as continuously as a tree in its intake and output. But,\nunlike the tree, it has a built-in system of jigs and fixtures that can be\nshifted to cause the machine to turn out a whole range of products from radio\ntubes and glass tumblers to Christmas-tree ornaments. Although an automated\nplant is almost like a tree in respect to the continuous intake and output, it\nis a tree that can change from oak to maple to walnut as required. It is part\nof the automation or electric logic that specialism is no longer limited to\njust one specialty. The automatic machine may work in a specialist way, but it\nis not limited to one line. As with our hands and fingers that are capable of\nmany tasks, the automatic unit incorporates a power of adaptation that was\nquite lacking in the pre-electric and mechanical stage of technology. As _any_\nthing becomes more complex, it becomes less specialized. Man is more complex\nand less specialized than a dinosaur. The older mechanical operations were\ndesigned to be more efficient as they became larger and more specialized. The\nelectric and automated unit, however, is quite otherwise. A new automatic\nmachine for making automobile tailpipes is about the size of two or three\noffice desks. The computer control panel is the size of a lectern. It has in\nit no dies, no fixtures, no settings of any kind, but rather certain general-\npurpose things like grippers, benders, and advancers. On this machine,\nstarting with lengths of ordinary pipe, it is possible to make eighty\ndifferent kinds of tailpipe in succession, as rapidly, as easily, and as\ncheaply as it is to make eighty of the same kind. And the characteristic of\nelectric automation is all in this direction of return to the general-purpose\nhandicraft flexibility that our own hands possess. The programming can now\ninclude endless changes of program. It is the electric feedback, or dialogue\npattern, of the automatic and computer-programmed “machine” that marks it off\nfrom the older mechanical principle of one-way movement.\n\nThis computer offers a model that has the characteristics shared by all\nautomation. From the point of intake of materials to the output of the\nfinished product, the operations tend to be independently, as well as\ninterdependently, automatic. The synchronized concert of operations is under\nthe control of gauges and instruments that can be varied from the control-\npanel boards that are themselves electronic. The material of intake is\nrelatively uniform in shape, size, and chemical properties, as likewise the\nmaterial of the output. But the processing under these conditions permits use\nof the highest level of capacity for any needed period. It is, as compared\nwith the older machines, the difference between an oboe in an orchestra and\nthe same tone on an electronic music instrument. With the electronic music\ninstrument, any tone can be made available in any intensity and for any length\nof time. Note that the older symphony orchestra was, by comparison, a machine\nof separate instruments that _gave the effect of organic unity_. With the\nelectronic instrument, one _starts_ with organic unity as an immediate fact of\nperfect synchronization. This makes the attempt to create the effect of\norganic unity quite pointless. Electronic music must seek other goals.\n\nSuch is also the harsh logic of industrial automation. All that we had\npreviously achieved mechanically by great exertion and coordination can now be\ndone electrically without effort. Hence the specter of joblessness and\npropertylessness in the electric age. Wealth and work become information\nfactors, and totally new structures are needed to run a business or relate it\nto social needs and markets. With the electric technology, the new kinds of\ninstant interdependence and interprocess that take over production also enter\nthe market and social organizations. For this reason, markets and education\ndesigned to cope with the products of servile toil and mechanical production\nare no longer adequate. Our education has long ago acquired the fragmentary\nand piecemeal character of mechanism. It is now under increasing pressure to\nacquire the depth and interrelation that are indispensable in the all-at-once\nworld of electric organization.\n\nParadoxically, automation makes liberal education mandatory. The electric age\nof servomechanisms suddenly releases men from the mechanical and specialist\nservitude of the preceding machine age. As the machine and the motorcar\nreleased the horse and projected it onto the plane of entertainment, so does\nautomation with men. We are suddenly threatened with a liberation that taxes\nour inner resources of self-employment and imaginative participation in\nsociety. This would seem to be a fate that calls men to the role of artist in\nsociety. It has the effect of making most people realize how much they had\ncome to depend on the fragmentalized and repetitive routines of the mechanical\nera. Thousands of years ago man, the nomadic food-gatherer, had taken up\npositional, or relatively sedentary, tasks. He began to specialize. The\ndevelopment of writing and printing were major stages of that process. They\nwere supremely specialist in separating the roles of knowledge from the roles\nof action, even though at times it could appear that “the pen is mightier than\nthe sword.” But with electricity and automation, the technology of fragmented\nprocesses suddenly fused with the human dialogue and the need for over-all\nconsideration of human unity. Men are suddenly nomadic gatherers of knowledge,\nnomadic as never before, informed as never before, free from fragmentary\nspecialism as never before — but also involved in the total social process as\nnever before; since with electricity we extend our central nervous system\nglobally, instantly interrelating every human experience. Long accustomed to\nsuch a state in stock-market news or front-page sensations, we can grasp the\nmeaning of this new dimension more readily when it is pointed out that it is\npossible to “fly” unbuilt airplanes on computers. The specifications of a\nplane can be programmed and the plane tested under a variety of extreme\nconditions before it has left the drafting board. So with new products and new\norganizations of many kinds. We can now, by computer, deal with complex social\nneeds with the same architectural certainty that we previously attempted in\nprivate housing. Industry as a whole has become the unit of reckoning, and so\nwith society, politics, and education as wholes.\n\nElectric means of storing and moving information with speed and precision make\nthe largest units quite as manageable as small ones. Thus the automation of a\nplant or of an entire industry offers a small model of the changes that must\noccur in society from the same electric technology. Total interdependence is\nthe starting fact. Nevertheless, the range of choice in design, stress, and\ngoal within that total field of electromagnetic interprocess is very much\ngreater than it ever could have been under mechanization.\n\nSince electric energy is independent of the place or kind of work-operation,\nit creates patterns of decentralism and diversity in the work to be done. This\nis a logic that appears plainly enough in the difference between firelight and\nelectric light, for example. Persons grouped around a fire or candle for\nwarmth or light are less able to pursue independent thoughts, or even tasks,\nthan people supplied with electric light. In the same way, the social and\neducational patterns latent in automation are those of self-employment and\nartistic autonomy. Panic about automation as a threat of uniformity on a world\nscale is the projection into the future of mechanical standardization and\nspecialism, which are now past.\n\n\n![Appendix](images/title-appendix.png)\n\n![End Notes](images/appendicies-end-notes.png)\n\n  * **Note 1:** See Chapter 2: Media Hot and Cold [↩](introductions.xhtml#en1)\n  * **Note 2:** References within the text of this edition have been left in the form used in earlier editions but corrected and/or given in fuller form, including date of original publication, whenever possible, in the Works Cited section.

A charismatic figure, whose remarkable perceptions propelled him onto\nthe international stage, McLuhan became the prophet of the new information\nage.\n\nIn his own time he drew both accolades and criticism for his intuitive vision.\nHis steady stream of thought-provoking metaphors regarding culture and\ntechnology fascinated his listeners, especially those involved in advertising,\npolitics, journalism, the arts, and media. The information superhighway\nfulfilled his perceptive observation that the world would ultimately become a\n“global village”.\n\nMarshall McLuhan's work continues to influence a number of disciplines, in\nparticular media studies, modern art, and semiotics.\n\nMarshall McLuhan received his M.A. in English literature from Trinity Hall,\nCambridge. His doctoral thesis (Cambridge) is a critique of communication\nthrough the ages, recounting the rise and fall of poetics, rhetoric and\ndialectic. Styles of discourse and learning ultimately influence perception\nand thereby determine the content of dialogue.\n\n![Portrait of Marshall McLuhan by Robert J.
